Abstract: Summary
Parastomal hernia (PSH) is a common complication in patients receiving ileal conduit urinary diversion after radical cystectomy. In this randomized controlled clinical trial, we validate our previous finding that extraperitonealization of ileal conduit decreases incidence of PSH. In total, 104 consecutive patients undergoing radical cystectomy at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center are randomized 1:1 to receive either modified (extraperitonealized) ileal conduit (n = 52) or conventional ileal conduit (n = 52). Primary endpoint is incidence of radiological PSH during follow-up. Incidence of radiological PSH is lower in the modified group than in the conventional group (11.5% vs. 28.8%; p = 0.028) after a median follow-up of 32 months, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.374 (95% confidence interval: 0.145–0.965, p = 0.034) in the modified conduit group. The results support our previous finding that extraperitonealization of the ileal conduit is effective for reducing risk of PSH in patients receiving ileal conduit diversion.

Abstract: The focal adhesion protein, Hic-5 plays a key role in promoting extracellular matrix deposition and remodeling by cancer associated fibroblasts within the tumor stroma to promote breast tumor cell invasion. However, whether stromal matrix gene expression is regulated by Hic-5 is still unknown. Utilizing a constitutive Hic-5 knockout, Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus-Polyoma Middle T-Antigen spontaneous breast tumor mouse model, bulk RNAseq analysis was performed on cancer associated fibroblasts isolated from Hic-5 knockout mammary tumors. Functional network analysis highlighted a key role for Hic-5 in extracellular matrix organization, with both structural matrix genes, as well as matrix remodeling genes being differentially expressed in relation to Hic-5 expression. The subcellular distribution of the MRTF-A transcription factor and expression of a subset of MRTF-A responsive genes was also impacted by Hic-5 expression. Additionally, cytokine array analysis of conditioned media from the Hic-5 and Hic-5 knockout cancer associated fibroblasts revealed that Hic-5 is important for the secretion of several key factors that are associated with matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and immune evasion. Together, these data provide further evidence of a central role for Hic-5 expression in cancer associated fibroblasts in regulating the composition and organization of the tumor stroma microenvironment to promote breast tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Aspirin-related gastrointestinal damage is of growing concern. Aspirin use modulates the gut microbiota and associated metabolites, such as bile acids (BAs), but how this impacts intestinal homeostasis remains unclear. Herein, using clinical cohorts and aspirin-treated mice, we identified an intestinal microbe, Parabacteroides goldsteinii, whose growth is suppressed by aspirin. Mice supplemented with P. goldsteinii or its BA metabolite, 7-keto-lithocholic acid (7-keto-LCA), showed reduced aspirin-mediated damage of the intestinal niche and gut barrier, effects that were lost with a P. goldsteinii hdhA mutant unable to generate 7-keto-LCA. Specifically, 7-keto-LCA promotes repair of the intestinal epithelium by suppressing signaling by the intestinal BA receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). 7-Keto-LCA was confirmed to be an FXR antagonist that facilitates Wnt signaling and thus self-renewal of intestinal stem cells. These results reveal the impact of oral aspirin on the gut microbiota and intestinal BA metabolism that in turn modulates gastrointestinal homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility decrease in response to bed rest, but the temporal and causal adaptations in human skeletal muscle metabolism are not fully defined. Here, we use an integrative approach to assess human skeletal muscle metabolism during bed rest and provide a multi-system analysis of how skeletal muscle and the circulatory system adapt to short- and long-term bed rest (German Clinical Trials: DRKS00015677). We uncover that intracellular glycogen accumulation after short-term bed rest accompanies a rapid reduction in systemic insulin sensitivity and less GLUT4 localization at the muscle cell membrane, preventing further intracellular glycogen deposition after long-term bed rest. We provide evidence of a temporal link between the accumulation of intracellular triglycerides, lipotoxic ceramides, and sphingomyelins and an altered skeletal muscle mitochondrial structure and function after long-term bed rest. An intracellular nutrient overload therefore represents a crucial determinant for rapid skeletal muscle insulin insensitivity and mitochondrial alterations after prolonged bed rest.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cell-based therapy for retinal degenerative diseases is a promising approach to restoring visual function. A clinical study using retinal organoid (RO) sheets was recently conducted in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. However, the graft preparation currently requires advanced skills to identify and excise suitable segments from the transplantable area of the limited number of suitable ROs. This remains a challenge for consistent clinical implementations. Herein, we enabled the enrichment of wild-type (non-reporter) retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) from dissociated ROs using a label-free ghost cytometry (LF-GC)-based sorting system, where a machine-based classifier was trained in advance with another RPC reporter line. The sorted cells reproducibly formed retinal spheroids large enough for transplantation and developed mature photoreceptors in the retinal degeneration rats. This method of enriching early RPCs with no specific surface antigens and without any reporters or chemical labeling is promising for robust preparation of graft tissues during cell-based therapy.

Abstract: Endothelial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4), a cell surface glycoprotein, has been implicated in endothelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction. In this study, the role of DPP-4 on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) dysfunction and the underlying mechanism were investigated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of DPP-4. Our results indicated that LPS (1 μg/ml) challenge resulted in either the production and releasing of DPP-4, as well as the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 in HPMECs. DPP-4 knockdown inhibited chemokine releasing and monolayer hyper-permeability in LPS challenged HPMECs. When cocultured with human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), DPP4 knockdown suppressed LPS-induced neutrophil-endothelial adhesion, PMN chemotaxis and trans-endothelial migration. Western blotting showed that DPP-4 knockdown attenuated LPS-induced activation of TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed that DPP-4 mediated LPS-induced endothelial inflammation by interacting with integrin-α5β1. Moreover, exogenous soluble DPP-4 treatment sufficiently activated integrin-α5β1 downstream FAK/AKT/NF-κB signaling, thereafter inducing ICAM-1 upregulation in HPMECs. Collectively, our results suggest that endothelia synthesis and release DPP-4 under the stress of endotoxin, which interact with integrin-α5β1 complex in an autocrine or paracrine manner to exacerbate endothelial inflammation and enhance endothelial cell permeability. Therefore, blocking DDP-4 could be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent endothelial dysfunction in ALI/ARDS.

Abstract: Summary
Individuals with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) harbor pathogenic germline PTEN variants that confer a significantly increased lifetime risk of various organ-specific cancers including second primary malignant neoplasms (SMNs). Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers that can predict individual-level cancer risk. Despite the highly promising value of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker for underlying sporadic cancers, the utility of cfDNA in individuals with known cancer-associated germline variants and subclinical cancers remains poorly understood. We perform ultra-low-pass whole-genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) of cfDNA from plasma samples from patients with PHTS and cancer as well as those without cancer. Analysis of cfDNA reveals that patients with PHTS and SMNs have distinct cfDNA size distribution, aberrant genome-wide fragmentation, and differential fragment end motif frequencies. Our work provides evidence that cfDNA profiles may be used as a marker for SMN risk in patients with PHTS.

Abstract: Chronic stress is a common emotional disorder in cancer patients. Chronic stress promotes progression of gastric cancer (GC) and leads to poor outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms remain not clear. Herein, we explored the possible mechanisms of chronic stress in GC progression. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets were analyzed for differentially expressed genes. Clinical data of GC were evaluated for their association with PlexinA1 using TCGA and Kaplan–Meier-plotter databases. Chronic stress of GC patients was evaluated using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used to induce chronic stress in mice. Gastric xenograft tumor was constructed using the sewing method. Chronic stress-like behaviors were assessed using light/dark box and tail suspension tests. Protein expression was detected using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Analyses of TCGA and the Kaplan–Meier-plotter databases showed that patients with high levels of PlexinA1 in GC had worse overall survival than those with low levels of PlexinA1. A total of 36 GC patients were enrolled in the study, and about 33% of the patients had chronic stress. Compared with patients without chronic stress, higher expression levels of adrenoceptor beta 2 and PlexinA1 were observed in patients with chronic stress. The tumor size in mice under CUMS was significantly increased compared with the control mice. Adrenoceptor beta 2, PlexinA1, N-cadherin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin, as well as Ki67 were highly expressed in the tumors of CUMS group. However, E-cadherin was lowly expressed in the tumors of CUMS group. Importantly, chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine or treatment with a selective β2 adrenergic receptor antagonist (ICI118,551) could reverse these effects. Our findings suggest that chronic stress plays an important role in GC progression and there is a potential for blocking the epinephrine-β2AR/PlexinA1 pathway in the treatment of GC.

Abstract: The mortality rate linked with nephrotic syndrome (NS) is quite high. The renal tubular injury influences the response of NS patients to steroid treatment. KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 2 (KANK2) regulates actin polymerization, which is required for renal tubular cells to maintain their function. In this study, we found that the levels of KANK2 in patients with NS were considerably lower than those in healthy controls, especially in NS patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). To get a deeper understanding of the KANK2 transcriptional control mechanism, the core promoter region of the KANK2 gene was identified. KANK2 was further found to be positively regulated by E2F Transcription Factor 1 (E2F1), Transcription Factor AP-2 Gamma (TFAP2C), and Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF1), both at mRNA and protein levels. Knocking down E2F1, TFAP2C, or NRF1 deformed the cytoskeleton of renal tubular cells and reduced F-actin content. EMSA and ChIP assays confirmed that all three transcription factors could bind to the upstream promoter transcription site of KANK2 to transactivate KANK2 in renal tubular epithelial cells. Our study suggests that E2F1, TFAP2C, and NRF1 play essential roles in regulating the KANK2 transcription, therefore shedding fresh light on the development of putative therapeutic options for the treatment of NS patients.

Abstract: Summary
Cultivated meat (also known as cultured meat) is a promising technology that faces substantial cost barriers, which are currently driven by the price of media components. Particularly, growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) drive the cost of serum-free media for relevant cells, including muscle satellite cells. Here, we engineered immortalized bovine satellite cells (iBSCs) for inducible expression of FGF2 and/or mutant RasG12V to overcome media growth factor requirements through autocrine signaling. Engineered cells were able to proliferate over multiple passages in FGF2-free medium, thereby eliminating the need for this costly component. Additionally, cells maintained their myogenicity, albeit with reduced myotube formation. Ultimately, this offers a proof of principle for lower-cost cultured meat production through cell line engineering.

Abstract: Quiescin/sulfhydryl oxidase (QSOX1) is a secreted flavoprotein that modulates cellular proliferation, migration and adhesion, roles attributed to its ability to organize the extracellular matrix. We previously showed that exogenously added QSOX1b induces smooth muscle cells migration in a process that depends on its enzymatic activity and that is mediated by hydrogen peroxide derived from Nox1, a catalytic subunit of NAD(P)H oxidases. Here, we report that exogenous QSOX1b also stimulates the migration of L929 fibroblasts and that this effect is regulated by its endocytosis. The use of endocytosis inhibitors and caveolin 1-knockdown demonstrated that this endocytic pathway is caveola-mediated. QSOX1b colocalized with Nox1 in intracellular vesicles, as detected by confocal fluorescence, suggesting that extracellular QSOX1b is endocytosed with the transmembrane Nox1. These results reveal that endosomal QSOX1b is a novel intracellular redox regulator of cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
ADG106, a ligand-blocking agonistic antibody targeting CD137 (4-1BB), exhibits promising results in preclinical studies, demonstrating tumor suppression in various animal models and showing a balanced profile between safety and efficacy. This phase 1 study enrolls 62 patients with advanced malignancies, revealing favorable tolerability up to the 5.0 mg/kg dose level. Dose-limiting toxicity occurs in only one patient (6.3%) at 10.0 mg/kg, resulting in grade 4 neutropenia. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events include leukopenia (22.6%), neutropenia (22.6%), elevated alanine aminotransferase (22.6%), rash (21.0%), itching (17.7%), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (17.7%). The overall disease control rates are 47.1% for advanced solid tumors and 54.5% for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Circulating biomarkers suggest target engagement by ADG106 and immune modulation of circulating T, B, and natural killer cells and cytokines interferon γ and interleukin-6, which may affect the probability of clinical efficacy. ADG106 has a manageable safety profile and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy in patients with advanced cancers (this study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03802955).

Abstract: Abnormalities in the function of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are crucial factors leading to joint damage of rheumatoid arthritis. In recent years, the role of circular RNA (circRNA) in RA has gradually been revealed. However, the functional regulation of FLSs mediated by circRNA and its potential mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we elucidated the expression profile of circRNA in FLSs, as well as the role and molecular mechanisms of circTldc1. Through sequencing and validation experiments on primary FLSs derived from collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats, we found that circTldc1 can promote FLSs proliferation and exacerbate CIA-induced joint damage. The data revealed that circTldc1's parent gene, Tldc1, is homologous to human Tldc1, and circTldc1 is located in the cytoplasm of FLSs, belonging to the exonic circRNA category. The results from bioinformatics analysis, molecular experiments on FLSs (manipulating circTldc1 expression in vitro), and animal experiments (local regulation of circTldc1 expression in vivo) collectively confirmed that circTldc1 promotes Tldc1 expression by targeting miR-485–5p. High expression of Tldc1 further enhances FLSs proliferation and inflammatory responses, thereby worsening joint damage in CIA rats. High expression of circTldc1 and its parent gene Tldc1 may serve as biomarkers for RA. Local regulation of circTldc1 and Tldc1 gene levels in the joint cavity may represent a potential strategy to improve joint damage and inflammation in RA.

Abstract: Summary
Promoting sustainable diets is crucial for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions. We investigated the potential for large-scale dietary shifts to address the impacts of climate change on agriculture and food through surveys and choice experiments in China, Japan, and Vietnam (n = 5,089). Our findings reveal that Asian consumers are largely unwilling to deviate from current dietary habits, particularly regarding the consumption of animal proteins. This reluctance persists despite significant preferences for environmental certification as a proxy for greater sustainability in food production, as expressed by wealthier and younger respondents. Information experiments demonstrate that altruistic messaging fails to induce change, and positive information about climate impacts weakens the influence of certification. However, self-enhancement framing, particularly effective with individuals aged 60 years and above, shows promise. Our findings provide valuable insights for researchers and policymakers seeking effective strategies to encourage sustainable diets, shedding light on challenges and potential avenues for successful intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Lassa fever (LF) is an acute viral illness that causes thousands of deaths annually in West Africa. There are currently no Lassa virus (LASV) vaccines or antivirals approved for human use. Recently, we showed that combinations of broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (BNhuMAbs) known as Arevirumab-2 or Arevirumab-3 protected up to 100% of cynomolgus macaques against challenge with diverse lineages of LASV when treatment was initiated at advanced stages of disease. This previous work assessed efficacy against parenteral exposure. However, transmission of LASV to humans occurs primarily by mucosal exposure to virus shed from Mastomys rodents. Here, we describe the development of a lethal intranasal exposure macaque model of LF. This model is employed to show that Arevirumab cocktails rescue 100% of macaques from lethal LASV infection when treatment is initiated 8 days after LASV exposure. Our work demonstrates BNhuMAbs have utility in treating LASV infection acquired through mucosal exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Precise molecular characterization of circulating polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) is hampered by their mixed composition of mature and immature cells and lack of specific markers. Here, we focus on mature CD66b+CD10+CD16+CD11b+ PMN-MDSCs (mPMN-MDSCs) from either cancer patients or healthy donors receiving G-CSF for stem cell mobilization (GDs). By RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments, we report the identification of a distinct gene signature shared by the different mPMN-MDSC populations under investigation, also validated in mPMN-MDSCs from GDs and tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments. Analysis of such a gene signature uncovers a specific transcriptional program associated with mPMN-MDSC differentiation and allows us to identify that, in patients with either solid or hematologic tumors and in GDs, CD52, CD84, and prostaglandin E receptor 2 (PTGER2) represent potential mPMN-MDSC-associated markers. Altogether, our findings indicate that mature PMN-MDSCs distinctively undergo specific reprogramming during differentiation and lay the groundwork for selective immunomonitoring, and eventually targeting, of mature PMN-MDSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial persisters, a subpopulation of genetically susceptible cells that are normally dormant and tolerant to bactericides, have been studied extensively because of their clinical importance. In comparison, much less is known about the determinants underlying fungicide-tolerant fungal persister formation in vivo. Here, we report that during mouse lung infection, Cryptococcus neoformans forms persisters that are highly tolerant to amphotericin B (AmB), the standard of care for treating cryptococcosis. By exploring stationary-phase indicator molecules and developing single-cell tracking strategies, we show that in the lung, AmB persisters are enriched in cryptococcal cells that abundantly produce stationary-phase molecules. The antioxidant ergothioneine plays a specific and key role in AmB persistence, which is conserved in phylogenetically distant fungi. Furthermore, the antidepressant sertraline (SRT) shows potent activity specifically against cryptococcal AmB persisters. Our results provide evidence for and the determinant of AmB-tolerant persister formation in pulmonary cryptococcosis, which has potential clinical significance.

Abstract: Summary
Regeneration of neurons has important implications for human health, and the retina provides an accessible system to study the potential of replacing neurons following injury. In previous work, we generated transgenic mice in which neurogenic transcription factors were expressed in Müller glia (MG) and showed that they stimulated neurogenesis following inner retinal damage. It was unknown, however, whether the timing or mode of injury mattered in this process. Here, we explored these parameters on induced neurogenesis from MG and show that MG expressing Ascl1 will generate new bipolar neurons with similar efficiency irrespective of injury mode or timing. However, MG that express Ascl1-Atoh1 produce a new type of retinal ganglion-like cell after outer retinal damage, which is absent with inner retinal damage. Our data suggest that although cell fate is primarily dictated by neurogenic transcription factors, the inflammatory state of MG relative to injury can influence the outcome of induced neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Broadly applicable methods to identify and characterize antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are key to immunology research, including studies of vaccine responses and immunity to infectious diseases. We developed a multiplexed activation-induced marker (AIM) assay that presents several advantages compared to single pairs of AIMs. The simultaneous measurement of four AIMs (CD69, 4-1BB, OX40, and CD40L) creates six AIM pairs that define CD4+ T cell populations with partial and variable overlap. When combined in an AND/OR Boolean gating strategy for analysis, this approach enhances CD4+ T cell detection compared to any single AIM pair, while CD8+ T cells are dominated by CD69/4-1BB co-expression. Supervised and unsupervised clustering analyses show differential expression of the AIMs in defined T helper lineages and that multiplexing mitigates phenotypic biases. Paired and unpaired comparisons of responses to infections (HIV and cytomegalovirus [CMV]) and vaccination (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) validate the robustness and versatility of the method.

Abstract: Summary
Emergency myelopoiesis (EM) is essential in immune defense against pathogens for rapid replenishing of mature myeloid cells. During the EM process, a rapid cell-cycle switch from the quiescent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to highly proliferative myeloid progenitors (MPs) is critical. How the rapid proliferation of MPs during EM is regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that ATG7, a critical autophagy factor, is essential for the rapid proliferation of MPs during human myelopoiesis. Peripheral blood (PB)-mobilized hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) with ATG7 knockdown or HSPCs derived from ATG7−/− human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exhibit severe defect in proliferation during fate transition from HSPCs to MPs. Mechanistically, we show that ATG7 deficiency reduces p53 localization in lysosome for a potential autophagy-mediated degradation. Together, we reveal a previously unrecognized role of autophagy to regulate p53 for a rapid proliferation of MPs in human myelopoiesis.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OC) is a lethal gynecologic cancer and the common cause of death within women worldwide. The polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase highly expressed in various tumors, including OC. However, the mechanistic basis of EZH2 oncogenic activity in OC remain incompletely understood. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the expression of MAPRE3 was lower in OC tissues than in normal tissues, and was positively correlated with the overall survival. MAPRE3 overexpression decreased cell growth, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in OC cells, whereas MAPRE3 silencing promoted proliferation and accelerated cell cycle progression of OC cells. The in vivo study validated that overexpression of MAPRE3 impeded tumor formation and growth of OC xenografts in nude mice. In addition, knockdown of EZH2 in OC cells downregulated H3K27me3 expression and increased MAPRE3 expression. Inhibiting EZH2 in OC cells reduced the enrichment of H3K27me3 on the promoter of MAPRE3. Furthermore, MAPRE3 silencing significantly reversed changes in the expression of cell cycle and apoptosis-related markers and cell growth mediated by EZH2 knockdown in OC cells. MAPRE3 functions as a suppressor of OC and is epigenetic repressed by EZH2, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for OC by targeting EZH2/MAPRE3 axis.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting oncogenes at the genomic DNA level can open new avenues for precision medicine. Significant efforts are ongoing to target oncogenes using RNA-targeted and protein-targeted platforms, but no progress has been made to target genomic DNA for cancer therapy. Here, we introduce a gamma peptide nucleic acid (γPNA)-based genomic DNA-targeted platform to silence oncogenes in vivo. γPNAs efficiently invade the mixed sequences of genomic DNA with high affinity and specificity. As a proof of concept, we establish that γPNA can inhibit c-Myc transcription in multiple cell lines. We evaluate the in vivo efficacy and safety of genomic DNA targeting in three pre-clinical models. We also establish that anti-transcription γPNA in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors and chemotherapeutic drugs results in robust antitumor activity in cell-line- and patient-derived xenografts. Overall, this strategy offers a unique therapeutic platform to target genomic DNA to inhibit oncogenes for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is an aggressive malignant disease with a poor prognosis. We previously found that p62 presented a marked nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation in ESCC cells as compared that in normal esophageal epithelial cells, but its effects on ESCC cells remain unclear. This study aims to clarify the impacts of different cellular localization of p62 on the function of ESCC cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We here demonstrated that cytoplasmic p62 enhances the migration and invasion abilities of esophageal cancer cells, whereas nuclear p62 has no effect. We further explored the interaction protein of p62 by using GST pull-down experiment and identified EPLIN as a potential protein interacting with p62. In addition, reducing EPLIN expression significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of ESCC cells, which were rescued when EPLIN expression was restored after the p62 knockdown. At a molecular level, p62 in cytoplasm positively regulated the expression of EPLIN via enhancing its protein stability. Data from the TCGA and GEO database displayed a significant up-regulation of EPLIN mRNA expression in ESCC tissues compared with corresponding paired esophageal epithelial samples. Our findings present evidence that the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of p62 protein contributes to an aggressive malignancy phenotype, providing candidate molecular biomarkers and potential molecular targets for the diagnosis and treatment of ESCC.

Botulinum toxin type a blocks aquaporin 5 trafficking by decreasing synaptosomal-associated protein 23 in submandibular acinar cells,

Abstract: The trafficking of aquaporin 5 (AQP5) is critical for salivary secretion. Synaptosomal-associated protein 23 (SNAP23) is an important regulator in the process of membrane fusion. However, the role of SNAP23 on AQP5 trafficking has not been explored. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) is a bacterial toxin that effectively treats sialorrhea. We previously reported that BoNT/A induced AQP5 redistribution in cultured acinar cells, but the mechanism remained unclear. In this study, SNAP23 was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane of acinar cells in the rat submandibular gland (SMG) and colocalized with AQP5 at the apical membrane of acinar cells. In stable GFP-AQP5-transfected SMG-C6 cells, the acetylcholine receptor agonist carbachol (CCh) induced trafficking of AQP5 from intracellular vesicles to the apical membrane. Furthermore, SNAP23 knockdown by siRNA significantly inhibited CCh-induced AQP5 trafficking, whereas this inhibitory effect was reversed by SNAP23 re-expression, indicating that SNAP23 was essential in AQP5 trafficking. More importantly, BoNT/A inhibited salivary secretion from SMGs, and the underlying mechanism involved that BoNT/A blocked CCh-triggered AQP5 trafficking by decreasing SNAP23 in acinar cells. Taken together, these results identified a crucial role for SNAP23 in AQP5 trafficking and provided new insights into the mechanism of BoNT/A in treating sialorrhea and thereby a theoretical basis for clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Idebenone, the only approved treatment for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), promotes recovery of visual function in up to 50% of patients, but we can neither predict nor understand the non-responders. Idebenone is reduced by the cytosolic NAD(P)H oxidoreductase I (NQO1) and directly shuttles electrons to respiratory complex III, bypassing complex I affected in LHON. We show here that two polymorphic variants drastically reduce NQO1 protein levels when homozygous or compound heterozygous. This hampers idebenone reduction. In its oxidized form, idebenone inhibits complex I, decreasing respiratory function in cells. By retrospectively analyzing a large cohort of idebenone-treated LHON patients, classified by their response to therapy, we show that patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous NQO1 variants have the poorest therapy response, particularly if carrying the m.3460G>A/MT-ND1 LHON mutation. These results suggest consideration of patient NQO1 genotype and mitochondrial DNA mutation in the context of idebenone therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Structural dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) glycoprotein mediate cell entry and facilitate immune evasion. Single-molecule FRET using peptides for Env labeling revealed structural dynamics of Env, but peptide use risks potential effects on structural integrity/dynamics. While incorporating noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into Env by amber stop-codon suppression, followed by click chemistry, offers a minimally invasive approach, this has proved to be technically challenging for HIV-1. Here, we develope an intact amber-free HIV-1 system that overcomes hurdles of preexisting viral amber codons. We achieved dual-ncAA incorporation into Env on amber-free virions, enabling single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies of click-labeled Env that validated the previous peptide-based labeling approaches by confirming the intrinsic propensity of Env to dynamically sample multiple conformational states. Amber-free click-labeled Env also enabled real-time tracking of single virion internalization and trafficking in cells. Our system thus permits in-virus bioorthogonal labeling of proteins, compatible with studies of virus entry, trafficking, and egress from cells.

Abstract: Neosetophomone B (NSP–B) is a unique meroterpenoid fungal secondary metabolite that has previously demonstrated promising anti-cancer properties against various cancer cell lines in vitro. However, its in vivo anti-cancer potential remaines unexplored. To fill this gap in our knowledge, we tested NSP-B's in vivo anti-cancer activity using a zebrafish model, an organism that has gained significant traction in biomedical research due to its genetic similarities with humans and its transparent nature, allowing real-time tumor growth observation. For our experiments, we employed the K562-injected zebrafish xenograft model. Upon treating these zebrafish with NSP-B, we observed a marked reduction in the size and number of tumor xenografts. Delving deeper, our analyses indicated that NSP-B curtailed tumor growth and proliferation of leukemic grafted xenograft within the zebrafish. These results show that NSP-B possesses potent in vivo anti-cancer properties, making it a potential novel therapeutic agent for addressing hematological malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
In early neurodevelopment, the central nervous system is established through the coordination of various neural organizers directing tissue patterning and cell differentiation. Better recapitulation of morphogen gradient production and signaling will be crucial for establishing improved developmental models of the brain in vitro. Here, we developed a method by assembling polydimethylsiloxane devices capable of generating a sustained chemical gradient to produce patterned brain organoids, which we termed morphogen-gradient-induced brain organoids (MIBOs). At 3.5 weeks, MIBOs replicated dorsal-ventral patterning observed in the ganglionic eminences (GE). Analysis of mature MIBOs through single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct dorsal GE-derived CALB2+ interneurons, medium spiny neurons, and medial GE-derived cell types. Finally, we demonstrate long-term culturing capabilities with MIBOs maintaining stable neural activity in cultures grown up to 5.5 months. MIBOs demonstrate a versatile approach for generating spatially patterned brain organoids for embryonic development and disease modeling.

Abstract: Summary
With the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), it is crucial to plan for charging in a way that considers both EV driver behavior and the electricity grid’s demand. Here, we integrate detailed mobility data with empirical charging preferences to estimate charging demand and demonstrate the power of personalized shifting recommendations to move individual EV drivers’ demand on the grid out of peak hours. We find an unbalanced geographical distribution of charging demand in the San Francisco Bay Area, with temporal peaks in both grid off-peak hours in the morning and on-peak hours in the evening. Aligning with mobility patterns, our strategy effectively shifts demand to off-peak times. With the 2050 target of 90% EVs, this shifting reduces total on-peak charging demand by 61%, which could require over ∼18,000 additional level 3 chargers. We recommend building more charging stations and implementing shifting recommendations for EV grid integration.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a key post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism; yet, its regulation and impact on human diseases remain understudied. Existing bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based APA methods predominantly rely on predefined annotations, severely impacting their ability to decode novel tissue- and disease-specific APA changes. Furthermore, they only account for the most proximal and distal cleavage and polyadenylation sites (C/PASs). Deconvoluting overlapping C/PASs and the inherent noisy 3′ UTR coverage in bulk RNA-seq data pose additional challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PolyAMiner-Bulk, an attention-based deep learning algorithm that accurately recapitulates C/PAS sequence grammar, resolves overlapping C/PASs, captures non-proximal-to-distal APA changes, and generates visualizations to illustrate APA dynamics. Evaluation on multiple datasets strongly evinces the performance merit of PolyAMiner-Bulk, accurately identifying more APA changes compared with other methods. With the growing importance of APA and the abundance of bulk RNA-seq data, PolyAMiner-Bulk establishes a robust paradigm of APA analysis.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the role of the microbiome in inflammatory diseases requires the identification of microbial effector molecules. We established an approach to link disease-associated microbes to microbial metabolites by integrating paired metagenomics, stool and plasma metabolomics, and culturomics. We identified host-microbial interactions correlated with disease activity, inflammation, and the clinical course of ulcerative colitis (UC) in the Predicting Response to Standardized Colitis Therapy (PROTECT) pediatric inception cohort. In severe disease, metabolite changes included increased dipeptides and tauro-conjugated bile acids (BAs) and decreased amino-acid-conjugated BAs in stool, whereas in plasma polyamines (N-acetylputrescine and N1-acetylspermidine) increased. Using patient samples and Veillonella parvula as a model, we uncovered nitrate- and lactate-dependent metabolic pathways, experimentally linking V. parvula expansion to immunomodulatory tryptophan metabolite production. Additionally, V. parvula metabolizes immunosuppressive thiopurine drugs through xdhA xanthine dehydrogenase, potentially impairing the therapeutic response. Our findings demonstrate that the microbiome contributes to disease-associated metabolite changes, underscoring the importance of these interactions in disease pathology and treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blockade has become a mainstay of cancer immunotherapy. Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with small molecules is an attractive approach to enhance antitumor immunity. Here, we identified a natural marine product, benzosceptrin C (BC), that enhances the cytotoxicity of T cells to cancer cells by reducing the abundance of PD-L1. Furthermore, BC exerts its antitumor effect in mice bearing MC38 tumors by activating tumor-infiltrating T cell immunity. Mechanistic studies suggest that BC can prevent palmitoylation of PD-L1 by inhibiting DHHC3 enzymatic activity. Subsequently, PD-L1 is transferred from the membrane to the cytoplasm and cannot return to the membrane via recycling endosomes, triggering lysosome-mediated degradation of PD-L1. Moreover, the combination of BC and anti-CTLA4 effectively enhances antitumor T cell immunity. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized antitumor mechanism of BC and represent an alternative immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Natural killer (NK) cells are triggered by the innate immune response in the tumor microenvironment. The extensive set of stimulating and inhibiting receptors mediates the target recognition of NK cells, and controls the strength of the effector reaction countering specific targeted cells. Yet, lacking major MHC (histocompatibility complex) MICA/B class I chain-related proteins on the membrane of tumor cells results in the failure of NK cell recognition and ability to resist NK cell destruction. Searching databases and molecular docking suggested that in cervical cancer, pterostilbene (3,5-dimethoxy-40-hydroxystilbene; PTS) in Vaccinium corymbosum extract could constrain PI3K/AKT signaling and improving the MICA/B expression. In flow cytometry, MTT assay, viability/cytotoxicity assay, and colony development assays, PTS reduced the development of cervical cancer cells and increased apoptosis. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and a Western blot indicate that PTS controlled the cytolytic action of NK cells in tumor cells via increasing the MICA/B expression, thus modifying the anti-tumor immune response in cervical cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious and poorly understood disease. To understand immune dysregulation in ME/CFS, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to examine immune cells in patient and control cohorts. Postexertional malaise (PEM), an exacerbation of symptoms following strenuous exercise, is a characteristic symptom of ME/CFS. To detect changes coincident with PEM, we applied scRNA-seq on the same cohorts following exercise. At baseline, ME/CFS patients display classical monocyte dysregulation suggestive of inappropriate differentiation and migration to tissue. We identify both diseased and more normal monocytes within patients, and the fraction of diseased cells correlates with disease severity. Comparing the transcriptome at baseline and postexercise challenge, we discover patterns indicative of improper platelet activation in patients, with minimal changes elsewhere in the immune system. Taken together, these data identify immunological defects present at baseline in patients and an additional layer of dysregulation in platelets.

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic lung disease among neonates, with increasing morbidity and mortality. This study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A) on hyperoxia-induced BPD. Hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse and alveolar epithelial cell models were constructed. The effects of hyperoxia on lung development were evaluated by histological and morphological analysis. The levels of KDM3A, E26 transformation specific-1 (ETS1), H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related indexes were quantified by RT-qPCR, Western blot, and IF staining. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. Transfection of oe-ETS1, oe-KDM3A, and sh-ETS1 was applied in hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cells to explore the mechanism of the KDM3A/ETS1 axis in hyperoxia-induced apoptosis. KDM3A inhibitor IOX1 was applied to validate the in vivo effect of KDM3A in hyperoxia-induced BPD mice. The results displayed that hyperoxia-induced BPD mice showed reduced body weight, severe destruction of alveolar structure, decreased radial alveolar count (RAC), and increased mean linear intercept (MLI) and mean alveolar diameter (MAD). Further, hyperoxia induction down-regulated ETS1 expression, raised ER stress levels, and increased apoptosis rate in BPD mice and alveolar epithelial cells. However, transfection of oe-ETS1 improved the above changes in hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cells. Moreover, transfection of oe-KDM3A up-regulated ETS1 expression, down-regulated H3K9me2 expression, inhibited ER stress, and reduced apoptosis rate in hyperoxia-induced alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, transfection of sh-ETS1 reversed the inhibitory effect of KDM3A on hyperoxia-induced apoptosis by regulating ER stress. In vivo experiments, KDM3A inhibitor IOX1 intervention further aggravated BPD in newborn mice. In a word, KDM3A alleviated hyperoxia-induced BPD in mice by promoting ETS1 expression.

Abstract: Summary
The human dendritic cell (DC) family has recently been expanded by CD1c+CD14+CD163+ DCs, introduced as DC3s. DC3s are found in tumors and peripheral blood of cancer patients. Here, we report elevated frequencies of CD14+ cDC2s, which restore to normal frequencies after tumor resection, in non-small cell lung cancer patients. These CD14+ cDC2s phenotypically resemble DC3s and exhibit increased PD-L1, MERTK, IL-10, and IDO expression, consistent with inferior T cell activation ability compared with CD14− cDC2s. In melanoma patients undergoing CD1c+ DC vaccinations, increased CD1c+CD14+ DC frequencies correlate with reduced survival. We demonstrate conversion of CD5+/−CD1c+CD14− cDC2s to CD14+ cDC2s by tumor-associated factors, whereas monocytes failed to express CD1c under similar conditions. Targeted proteomics identified IL-6 and M-CSF as dominant drivers, and we show that IL-6R and CSF1R inhibition prevents tumor-induced CD14+ cDC2s. Together, this indicates cDC2s as direct pre-cursors of DC3-like CD1c+CD14+ DCs and provides insights into the importance and modulation of CD14+ DC3s in anti-tumor immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Intending to reduce the related environmental impact of olive oil wastewater while producing new by-products, this research paper proposes an innovative solution for the treatment of wastewater that combines microfiltration and ultrafiltration techniques with microalgae cultivation. Laboratory scale analysis and pilot scale operation have been performed to assess the techno-economic viability of the olive mill wastewater for Arthrospira platensis production. More precisely, growth rate, time of division, and characterization (lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and so forth) of microalgae are evaluated. The results obtained from the techno-economic analysis show that the integration of the systems makes it possible to efficiently exploit the inorganic nutrients of the olive mill wastewater for the cultivation of Arthrospira platensis. In particular, the quality of the obtained biomass complies with the food grade regulations, whereas avoided costs for the olive mill wastewater disposal bring a reduction of 70% in the biomass production cost.

Abstract: Summary
Single-molecule enzyme activity-based enzyme profiling (SEAP) is a methodology to globally analyze protein functions in living samples at the single-molecule level. It has been previously applied to detect functional alterations in phosphatases and glycosidases. Here, we expand the potential for activity-based biomarker discovery by developing a semi-automated synthesis platform for fluorogenic probes that can detect various peptidases and protease activities at the single-molecule level. The peptidase/protease probes were prepared on the basis of a 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin fluorophore. The introduction of a phosphonic acid to the core scaffold made the probe suitable for use in a microdevice-based assay, while phosphonic acid served as the handle for the affinity separation of the probe using Phos-tag. Using this semi-automated scheme, 48 fluorogenic probes for the single-molecule peptidase/protease activity analysis were prepared. Activity-based screening using blood samples revealed altered single-molecule activity profiles of CD13 and DPP4 in blood samples of patients with early-stage pancreatic tumors. The study shows the power of single-molecule enzyme activity screening to discover biomarkers on the basis of the functional alterations of proteins.

Abstract: Summary
A major goal of regenerative medicine is to generate tissue-specific mature and functional cells. However, current cell engineering protocols are still unable to systematically produce fully mature functional cells. While existing computational approaches aim at predicting transcription factors (TFs) for cell differentiation/reprogramming, no method currently exists that specifically considers functional cell maturation processes. To address this challenge, here, we develop SinCMat, a single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based computational method for predicting cell maturation TFs. Based on a model of cell maturation, SinCMat identifies pairs of identity TFs and signal-dependent TFs that co-target genes driving functional maturation. A large-scale application of SinCMat to the Mouse Cell Atlas and Tabula Sapiens accurately recapitulates known maturation TFs and predicts novel candidates. We expect SinCMat to be an important resource, complementary to preexisting computational methods, for studies aiming at producing functionally mature cells.

Abstract: Summary
Hemagglutinins (HAs) from human influenza viruses descend from avian progenitors that bind α2-3-linked sialosides and must adapt to glycans with α2-6-linked sialic acids on human airway cells to transmit within the human population. Since their introduction during the 1968 pandemic, H3N2 viruses have evolved over the past five decades to preferentially recognize human α2-6-sialoside receptors that are elongated through addition of poly-LacNAc. We show that more recent H3N2 viruses now make increasingly complex interactions with elongated receptors while continuously selecting for strains maintaining this phenotype. This change in receptor engagement is accompanied by an extension of the traditional receptor-binding site to include residues in key antigenic sites on the surface of HA trimers. These results help explain the propensity for selection of antigenic variants, leading to vaccine mismatching, when H3N2 viruses are propagated in chicken eggs or cells that do not contain such receptors.

Abstract: RNA binding protein RBM10 participates in various RNA metabolism, and its decreased expression or loss of function by mutation has been identified in many human cancers. However, how its dysregulation contributes to human cancer pathogenesis remains to be determined. Here, we found that RBM10 expression was decreased in breast tumors, and breast cancer patients with low RBM10 expression presented poorer survival rates. RBM10 depletion in breast cancer cells significantly promotes the cellular proliferation and migration. We further demonstrated that RBM10 forms a triple complex with YBX1 and phosphatase 1B (PPM1B), in which PPM1B serves as the phosphatase of YBX1. RBM10 knock-down markedly attenuated association between YBX1 and PPM1B, leading to elevated levels of YBX1 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation. Furthermore, cancer cells with RBM10 depletion had a significantly accelerated tumor growth in nude mice. Importantly, these enhanced tumorigenic phenotypes can be reversed by overexpression of PPM1B. Our findings provide the mechanistic bases for functional loss of RBM10 in promoting tumorigenicity, and are potentially useful in the development of combined therapeutic strategies for cancer patients with defective RBM10.

Abstract: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are vulnerable to drug resistance. Although drug resistance has been taken much attention to HCC therapy, little is known of regorafenib and regorafenib resistance (RR). This study aimed to determine the drug resistance pattern and the role of RhoA in RR. Two regorafenib-resistant cell lines were constructed based on Huh7 and Hep3B cell lines. In vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to study RhoA expression, the activity of Hippo signaling pathway and cancer stem cell (CSC) traits. The data showed that RhoA was highly expressed, Hippo signaling was hypoactivated and CSC traits were more prominent in RR cells. Inhibiting RhoA could reverse RR, and the alliance of RhoA inhibition and regorafenib synergistically attenuated CSC phenotype. Furthermore, inhibiting LARG/RhoA increased Kibra/NF2 complex formation, prevented YAP from shuttling into the nucleus and repressed CD44 mRNA expression. Clinically, the high expression of RhoA correlated with poor prognosis. LARG, RhoA, YAP1 and CD44 show positive correlation with each other. Thus, inhibition of RhoGEF/RhoA has the potential to reverse RR and repress CSC phenotype in HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Steatotic liver disease (SLD) prevails as the most common chronic liver disease yet lack approved treatments due to incomplete understanding of pathogenesis. Recently, elevated hepatic and circulating interleukin 32 (IL-32) levels were found in individuals with severe SLD. However, the mechanistic link between IL-32 and intracellular triglyceride metabolism remains to be elucidated. We demonstrate in vitro that incubation with IL-32β protein leads to an increase in intracellular triglyceride synthesis, while downregulation of IL32 by small interfering RNA leads to lower triglyceride synthesis and secretion in organoids from human primary hepatocytes. This reduction requires the upregulation of Phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A). Furthermore, downregulation of IL32 results in lower intracellular type I collagen levels in di-lineage human primary hepatic organoids. Finally, we identify a genetic variant of IL32 (rs76580947) associated with lower circulating IL-32 and protection against SLD measured by non-invasive tests. These data suggest that IL32 downregulation may be beneficial against SLD.

Abstract: Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that can cause excitatory neurotoxicity when its extracellular concentration is too high, leading to disrupted calcium balance and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cordycepin, a nucleoside adenosine derivative, has been shown to protect against excitatory neurotoxicity induced by glutamate. To investigate its potential neuroprotective effects, the present study employed fluorescence detection and spectrophotometry techniques to analyze primary hippocampal-cultured neurons. The results showed that glutamate toxicity reduced hippocampal neuron viability, increased ROS production, and increased intracellular calcium levels. Additionally, glutamate-induced cytotoxicity activated acetylcholinesterase and decreased glutathione levels. However, cordycepin inhibited glutamate-induced cell death, improved cell viability, reduced ROS production, and lowered Ca2+ levels. It also inhibited acetylcholinesterase activation and increased glutathione levels. This study suggests that cordycepin can protect against glutamate-induced neuronal injury in cell models, and this effect was inhibited by adenosine A1 receptor blockers, indicating that its neuroprotective effect is achieved through activation of the adenosine A1 receptor.

Abstract: Summary
Although early life colonization of commensal microbes contributes to long-lasting immune imprinting in host tissues, little is known regarding the pathophysiological consequences of postnatal microbial tuning of cutaneous immunity. Here, we show that postnatal exposure to specific skin commensal Staphylococcus lentus (S. lentus) promotes the extent of atopic dermatitis (AD)-like inflammation in adults through priming of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). Early postnatal skin is dynamically populated by discrete subset of primed ILC2s driven by microbiota-dependent induction of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in keratinocytes. Specifically, the indole-3-aldehyde-producing tryptophan metabolic pathway, shared across Staphylococcus species, is involved in TSLP-mediated ILC2 priming. Furthermore, we demonstrate a critical contribution of the early postnatal S. lentus-TSLP-ILC2 priming axis in facilitating AD-like inflammation that is not replicated by later microbial exposure. Thus, our findings highlight the fundamental role of time-dependent neonatal microbial-skin crosstalk in shaping the threshold of innate type 2 immunity co-opted in adulthood.

Abstract: Microtubules constitute pivotal structural elements integral to cellular architecture and physiological functionality. Within the epidermis of the skin, microtubules undergo a noteworthy transition in orientation, shifting from centrosomal to non-centrosomal configurations during the processes of differentiation and stratification. This transition aligns with a discernible increase in the expression of CAMSAP3, a protein that binds to the minus end of microtubules, thereby regulating their orientation. In this study, we identified microtubule-bound CAMSAP3 within HaCaT keratinocytes, revealing an upregulation during the mitotic phase and accumulation at the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis. Building upon this observation, we scrutinized cellular responses upon a tetracycline/doxycycline-inducible CAMSAP3 expression in CAMSAP3-deficient HaCaT cells. Remarkably, CAMSAP3 deficiency induced shifts in microtubule orientation, resulting in cell cycle exit and delayed cytokinesis in a subset of the cells. Furthermore, our inquiry unveiled that CAMSAP3 deficiency adversely impacted the formation and stability of Adherens Junctions and Tight Junctions. In contrast, these perturbations were rectified upon the re-expression of CAMSAP3, underscoring the pivotal role of CAMSAP3 in manifesting differentiation-dependent characteristics in stratified keratinocytes. These observations emphasize the significance of CAMSAP3 in maintaining epidermal homeostasis.

Abstract: Early repolarization syndrome (ERS) is defined as occurring in patients with early repolarization pattern who have survived idiopathic ventricular fibrillation with clinical evaluation unrevealing for other explanations. The pathophysiologic basis of the ERS is currently uncertain. The objective of the present study was to examine the electrophysiological mechanism of ERS utilizing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Whole genome sequencing was used to identify the DPP6 (c.2561T > C/p.L854P) variant in four families with sudden cardiac arrest induced by ERS. Cardiomyocytes were generated from iPSCs from a 14-year-old boy in the four families with ERS and an unrelated healthy control subject. Patch clamp recordings revealed more significant prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) and increased transient outward potassium current (Ito) (103.97 ± 18.73 pA/pF vs 44.36 ± 16.54 pA/pF at +70 mV, P < 0.05) in ERS cardiomyocytes compared with control cardiomyocytes. Of note, the selective correction of the causal variant in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing normalized the Ito, whereas prolongation of the APD remained unchanged. ERS cardiomyocytes carrying DPP6 mutation increased Ito and lengthen APD, which maybe lay the electrophysiological foundation of ERS.

Abstract: The development of sepsis can lead to many organ dysfunction and even death. Myocardial injury is one of the serious complications of sepsis leading to death. New evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in infection myocardial injury. However, the mechanism which miR-208a-5p regulates sepsis-induced myocardial injury remains unclear. To mimic sepsis-induced myocardial injury in vitro, rat primary cardiomyocytes were treated with LPS. Cell viability and apoptosis were tested by CCK-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. The secretion of inflammatory factors was analyzed by ELISA. mRNA and protein levels were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The interaction among SP1, XIAP and miR-208a-5p was detected using dual luciferase report assay. Ultrasonic analysis and HE staining was performed to observe the effect of miR-208a-5p in sepsis-induced rats. Our findings indicated that miR-208a-5p expression in primary rat cardiomyocytes was increased by LPS. MiR-208a-5p inhibitor reversed LPS-induced cardiomyocytes injury through inhibiting the apoptosis. Furthermore, the inflammatory injury in cardiomyocytes was induced by LPS, which was rescued by miR-208a-5p inhibitor. In addition, downregulation of miR-208a-5p improved LPS-induced sepsis myocardial injury in vivo. Mechanistically, XIAP might be a target gene of miR-208a-5p. SP1 promoted transcription of miR-208a by binding to the miR-208a promoter region. Moreover, silencing of XIAP reversed the regulatory of miR-208a-5p inhibitor on cardiomyocytes injury. To sum up, those findings revealed silencing of miR-208a-5p could alleviate sepsis-induced myocardial injury, which would grant a new process for the treatment of sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
In natural and engineered environments, iron biocorrosion is an energy reservoir for growth of methanogens. However, how archaea accept electrons from metallic iron remains enigmatic. Here, we report that a Methanothrix-dominated methanogenic community from anaerobic granular sludge can reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) via electron uptake from zero-valent iron (ZVI). Through the batch experiments, a maximum CH4 yield of 40.8 ± 0.6 μeequiv/day and an electron recovery from ZVI oxidation to CH4 generation of 69.7% ± 6.1% are observed. Metagenome analysis and inhibition experiments indicate that electrons released by corrosive bacteria are utilized by Methanothrix for accomplishing CO2-to-CH4 conversion via potential intracellular and extracellular electron transfer. The results of activity tests of four electron donors (i.e., ZVI, stainless steel, H2, and acetate) suggest that the ZVI-dependent methanogenesis dominate the overall CH4 generation compared with hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis, which provides a new insight into autotrophic metabolism of methanogens.

Abstract: Summary
In metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC), cisplatin versus carboplatin leads to durable disease control in a subset of patients. The IMvigor130 trial reveals more favorable effects with atezolizumab combined with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GemCis) versus gemcitabine and carboplatin (GemCarbo). This study investigates the immunomodulatory effects of cisplatin as a potential explanation for these observations. Our findings indicate that improved outcomes with GemCis versus GemCarbo are primarily observed in patients with pretreatment tumors exhibiting features of restrained adaptive immunity. In addition, GemCis versus GemCarbo ± atezolizumab induces transcriptional changes in circulating immune cells, including upregulation of antigen presentation and T cell activation programs. In vitro experiments demonstrate that cisplatin, compared with carboplatin, exerts direct immunomodulatory effects on cancer cells, promoting dendritic cell activation and antigen-specific T cell killing. These results underscore the key role of immune modulation in cisplatin’s efficacy in mUC and highlight the importance of specific chemotherapy backbones in immunotherapy combination regimens.

Abstract: Summary
Low hierarchy and disruptive functionality of carbonaceous materials from biomass pyrolysis restrict their energy and environmental applications. Here, we report a cascade strategy to engineer bagasse into activated porous carbon with regulated morphology and functional groups. The initial pyrolysis of bagasse at 350°C –850°C facilitates curve sheet morphology and random meso-/micro-porosity. The subsequent alkali calcination leads to a micropore and comb-like structure with specific surface area and pore volume of 1,276.7 m2/g and 579.5 × 10−3 cm3/g, respectively. The last acid rinse removes the remaining –OH and –COO groups on the biochar surface. As a result, activated porous carbon processed at 450°C and activated with KOH/HCl exhibits the highest adsorption capacity of 103.4 mg/g at a rapid equilibrium rate fitted with Freundlich adsorption isotherm and facilitates steady mercury removal under pH 3–11. This study provides an effective approach to engineering agricultural waste into superior adsorbents for wastewater remediation.

Abstract: Summary
The lysosome-targeting chimera (LYTAC) approach has shown promise for the targeted degradation of secreted and membrane proteins via lysosomes. However, there have been challenges in design, development, and targeting. Here, we have designed a genetically engineered transferrin receptor (TfR)-mediated lysosome-targeting chimera (TfR-LYTAC) that is efficiently internalized via TfR-mediate endocytosis and targets PD-L1 for lysosomal degradation in cultured cells but not in vivo due to short half-life and poor tumor targeting. A delivery platform was developed by fusing TfR-LYTAC to the surface of bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The engineered OMV-LYTAC combines PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition with LYTAC and immune activation by bacterial OMVs. OMV-LYTAC significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. We have provided a modular and simple genetic strategy for lysosomal degradation as well as a delivery platform for in vivo tumor targeting. The study paves the way for the targeting and degradation of extracellular proteins using the TfR-LYTAC system.

Abstract: Summary
Early time-restricted eating (eTRE) improves aspects of cardiometabolic health. Although the circadian system appears to regulate nutrient absorption, little is known about the effects of eTRE on intestinal absorption. In this randomized crossover trial, 16 healthy adults follow a controlled, weight maintenance diet for 9 days, consuming all calories between 0800 and 1400 (eTRE schedule) or 0800 and 2000 (control schedule). We measure the energy content of the diet, stool, and urine with bomb calorimetry and calculate intestinal energy absorption. The eTRE schedule is more effective than the control eating schedule for improving markers of cardiometabolic health, including 24-h mean glucose concentrations and glycemic variability, assessed as the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions. However, eTRE has no effect on intestinal energy and macronutrient absorption, gastrointestinal transit time, colonic hydrogen gas production, or stool microbial composition, suggesting eTRE does not impact gastrointestinal function. This trial is registered (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04877262).

Abstract: Background
The tumour microenvironment (TME) of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) consists of different subtypes of cells that interact with the tumour or with each other. This study investigates the possibility of co-culturing HNSCC cells with different stroma cells in a zebrafish xenograft model, focusing on the effect of stroma cells on HNSCC growth and response to irradiation.
Material and method
HNSCC metastatic cell line HSC-3 was used along with five types of stroma cells: normal gingival fibroblasts (NOF), cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF), macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The mixture of HSC-3 cells and each-stroma cell type-was injected into 2-day post-fertilization zebrafish embryos, and the effect of stroma cells on tumour growth was tested. The study also aimed to mimic the HNSCC tumour by injecting a mixture of HSC-3 cells, CAFs, macrophages, and HUVECs into zebrafish embryos and testing the effect of these stroma cells on the cancer cells' response to irradiation compared to HSC-3-only tumours.
Results
CAFs had a significant inducement effect on tumour size, while HUVECs showed the opposite effect. The irradiated group of HSC-3-only tumour had a significantly smaller tumor cell area compared to the control, while the group with stroma cells and HSC-3 cells showed cancer cells being resistant to irradiation.
Conclusion
This is the first report of co-culturing cancer cells with several types of stroma cells using a zebrafish xenograft model. This study also highlighted the role of stroma cells in turning the cancer cells from radioresponsive to radioresistant.

Abstract: Objective
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common malignancy with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to determine the influence and underlying mechanisms of CLSPN on OSCC.
Methods
CLSPN expression was tested using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Flow cytometry, cell counting kit, and colony formation assays were performed to determine OSCC cell apoptosis, viability, and proliferation, respectively. In OSCC cells, the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), oxygen consumption rate (OCR), glucose uptake, and lactate production were determined using the corresponding kits. Changes in the protein levels of HK2, PKM2, LDHA, Wnt3a, and β-catenin were assessed using western blotting.
Results
CLSPN expression was increased in OSCC tissues. Overexpression of CLSPN in HSC-2 cells promoted cell proliferation, increased the levels of ECAR, glucose uptake, and lactate production, and increased the protein levels of HK2, PKM2, LDHA, Wnt3a, and β-catenin, but inhibited OCR levels and apoptosis. The knockdown of CLSPN in CAL27 cells resulted in the opposite results. Moreover, the effects of CLSPN overexpression on glycolysis and OSCC cell proliferation were reversed by Wnt3a knockdown. In vivo, knockdown of CLSPN restrained tumor growth, glycolysis, and the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
Conclusion
CLSPN promoted glycolysis and OSCC cell proliferation, and reduced apoptosis, which was achieved by the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Cold exposure activates brown adipose tissue (BAT) and potentially improves cardiometabolic health through the secretion of signaling lipids by BAT. Here, we show that 2 h of cold exposure in young adults increases the levels of omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins, the endocannabinoids (eCBs) anandamide and docosahexaenoylethanolamine, and lysophospholipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. Contrarily, it decreases the levels of the eCBs 1-LG and 2-LG and 1-OG and 2-OG, lysophosphatidic acids, and lysophosphatidylethanolamines. Participants overweight or obese show smaller increases in omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins levels compared to normal weight. We observe that only a small proportion (∼4% on average) of the cold-induced changes in the plasma signaling lipids are slightly correlated with BAT volume. However, cold-induced changes in omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins are negatively correlated with adiposity, glucose homeostasis, lipid profile, and liver parameters. Lastly, a 24-week exercise-based randomized controlled trial does not modify plasma signaling lipid response to cold exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia is a poor-prognosis cancer commonly stratified by genetic aberrations, but these mutations are often heterogeneous and fail to consistently predict therapeutic response. Here, we combine transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic datasets with ex vivo drug sensitivity data to help understand the underlying pathophysiology of AML beyond mutations. We measure the proteome and phosphoproteome of 210 patients and combine them with genomic and transcriptomic measurements to identify four proteogenomic subtypes that complement existing genetic subtypes. We build a predictor to classify samples into subtypes and map them to a “landscape” that identifies specific drug response patterns. We then build a drug response prediction model to identify drugs that target distinct subtypes and validate our findings on cell lines representing various stages of quizartinib resistance. Our results show how multiomics data together with drug sensitivity data can inform therapy stratification and drug combinations in AML.

Abstract: Summary
Methyl ketone (MK)-ascarosides represent essential components of several pheromones in Caenorhabditis elegans, including the dauer pheromone, which triggers the stress-resistant dauer larval stage, and the male-attracting sex pheromone. Here, we identify an acyl-CoA thioesterase, ACOT-15, that is required for the biosynthesis of MK-ascarosides. We propose a model in which ACOT-15 hydrolyzes the β-keto acyl-CoA side chain of an ascaroside intermediate during β-oxidation, leading to decarboxylation and formation of the MK. Using comparative metabolomics, we identify additional ACOT-15-dependent metabolites, including an unusual piperidyl-modified ascaroside, reminiscent of the alkaloid pelletierine. The β-keto acid generated by ACOT-15 likely couples to 1-piperideine to produce the piperidyl ascaroside, which is much less dauer-inducing than the dauer pheromone, asc-C6-MK (ascr#2, 1). The bacterial food provided influences production of the piperidyl ascaroside by the worm. Our work shows how the biosynthesis of MK- and piperidyl ascarosides intersect and how bacterial food may impact chemical signaling in the worm.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an extremely common clinical arrhythmia disease, but whether its mechanism is associated with ferroptosis remains unclear. The tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) are involved in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, however, their role and mechanism in atrial remodeling in AF have not been studied. We aimed to explore whether tsRNAs mediate ferroptosis in AF progression. The AF models were constructed to detect ferroptosis-related indicators, and Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) was introduced to clarify the relationship between ferroptosis and AF. Atrial myocardial tissue was used for small RNA sequencing to screen potential tsRNAs. tsRNA functioned on ferroptosis and AF was explored. Atrial fibrosis and changes in the cellular structures and arrangement were observed in AF mice model, and these alterations were accompanied by ferroptosis occurrence, exhibited by the accumulation of Fe2+ and MDA levels and the decrease of expression of FTH1, GPX4, and SLC7A11. Blocking above ferroptosis activation with Fer-1 resulted in a significant improvement for AF. A total of 7 tsRNAs were upregulated (including tsRNA-5008a) and 2 tsRNAs were downregulated in atrial myocardial tissue in the AF group compared with the sham group. We constructed a tsRNA-mRNA regulated network, which showed tsRNA-5008a targeted 16 ferroptosis-related genes. Knockdown of tsRNA-5008a significantly suppressed ferroptosis through targeting SLC7A11 and diminished myocardial fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo. On the contrary, tsRNA-5008a mimics promoted ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes. Collectively, tsRNA-5008a involved in AF through ferroptosis. Our study provides novel insights into the role of tsRNA-5008a mediated ferroptosis in AF progression.

Abstract: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the main components in the tumor microenvironment. Tumors activate fibroblasts from quiescent state into activated state by secreting cytokines, and activated CAFs may in turn promote tumor progression and metastasis. Therefore, studies targeting CAFs could enrich the therapeutic options for tumor treatment. In this study, we demonstrate that the content of lipid droplets and the expression of autophagosomes were higher in CAFs than in peri-tumor fibroblasts (PTFs), which was inhibited by 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid(TOFA). The expression of CD36 in CAFs was higher than that in PTFs at both mRNA and protein levels. Inhibition of CD36 activity using either the CD36 inhibitor SSO or siRNA had a significant negative impact on the proliferation and migration abilities of CAFs, which was associated with reduced levels of relevant activated genes (α-SMA, FAP, Vimentin) and cytokines (IL-6, TGF-β and VEGF-α). SSO also inhibited HCC growth and tumorigenesis in nude mice orthotopically implanted with CAFs and HCC cells. Our data further show that CD36+CAFs affected the expression of PD-1 in CTLs leading to CTL exhaustion, and that patients with high CD36 expression in CAFs were correlated with shorter overall survival (OS). Together, our data demonstrate that CAFs were active in lipid metabolism with increased lipid content and lipophagy activity. CD36 may play a key role in the regulation of the biological behaviors of CAFs, which may influence the proliferation and migration of tumor cells by reprograming the lipid metabolism in tumor cells. Thus, CD36 could be an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the most intractable subpopulation of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, which have been associated with a high risk of relapse and poor prognosis. However, eradication of CSCs continues to be difficult. Here, we integrate the multiomics data of a TNBC cohort (n = 360) to identify vital markers of CSCs. We discover that EMSY, inducing a BRCAness phenotype, is preferentially expressed in breast CSCs, promotes ALDH+ cells enrichment, and is positively correlated with poor relapse-free survival. Mechanistically, EMSY competitively binds to the Jmjc domain, which is critical for KDM5B enzyme activity, to reshape methionine metabolism, and to promote CSC self-renewal and tumorigenesis in an H3K4 methylation-dependent manner. Moreover, EMSY accumulation in TNBC cells sensitizes them to PARP inhibitors against bulk cells and methionine deprivation against CSCs. These findings indicate that clinically relevant eradication of CSCs could be achieved with a strategy that targets CSC-specific vulnerabilities in amino acid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The bacterial genotoxin colibactin promotes colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis, but systematic assessment of its impact on DNA repair is lacking, and its effect on response to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics is unknown. We find that CRC cell lines display differential response to colibactin on the basis of homologous recombination (HR) proficiency. Sensitivity to colibactin is induced by inhibition of ATM, which regulates DNA double-strand break repair, and blunted by HR reconstitution. Conversely, CRC cells chronically infected with colibactin develop a tolerant phenotype characterized by restored HR activity. Notably, sensitivity to colibactin correlates with response to irinotecan active metabolite SN38, in both cell lines and patient-derived organoids. Moreover, CRC cells that acquire colibactin tolerance develop cross-resistance to SN38, and a trend toward poorer response to irinotecan is observed in a retrospective cohort of CRCs harboring colibactin genomic island. Our results shed insight into colibactin activity and provide translational evidence on its chemoresistance-promoting role in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Docetaxel is the most commonly used chemotherapy for advanced prostate cancer (PC), including castration-resistant disease (CRPC), but the eventual development of docetaxel resistance constitutes a major clinical challenge. Here, we demonstrate activation of the cholinergic muscarinic M1 receptor (CHRM1) in CRPC cells upon acquiring resistance to docetaxel, which is manifested in tumor tissues from PC patients post- vs. pre-docetaxel. Genetic and pharmacological inactivation of CHRM1 restores the efficacy of docetaxel in resistant cells. Mechanistically, CHRM1, via its first and third extracellular loops, interacts with the SEMA domain of cMET and forms a heteroreceptor complex with cMET, stimulating a downstream mitogen-activated protein polykinase program to confer docetaxel resistance. Dicyclomine, a clinically available CHRM1-selective antagonist, reverts resistance and restricts the growth of multiple docetaxel-resistant CRPC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. Our study reveals a CHRM1-dictated mechanism for docetaxel resistance and identifies a CHRM1-targeted combinatorial strategy for overcoming docetaxel resistance in PC.

Abstract: Summary
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted agents have proven to be effective, however, the development of resistance to these agents has become an obstacle in treating HER2+ breast cancer. Evidence implicates HUNK as an anti-cancer target for primary and resistant HER2+ breast cancers. In this study, a selective inhibitor of HUNK is characterized alongside a phosphorylation event in a downstream substrate of HUNK as a marker for HUNK activity in HER2+ breast cancer. Rubicon has been established as a substrate of HUNK that is phosphorylated at serine (S) 92. Findings indicate that HUNK-mediated phosphorylation of Rubicon at S92 promotes both autophagy and tumorigenesis in HER2/neu+ breast cancer. HUNK inhibition prevents Rubicon S92 phosphorylation in HER2/neu+ breast cancer models and inhibits tumorigenesis.

Abstract: The existing knowledge of the involvement of vinculin (VCL) in the control of ovarian cell functions is insufficient. To understand the role of VCL in the control of basic porcine ovarian granulosa cell functions, we decreased VCL activity by small interfering RNA (VCL siRNA). The expression of VCL, accumulation of VCL protein, cell viability, proliferation (accumulation of PCNA and cyclin B1), proportion of proliferative active cells, apoptosis (accumulation of bax, caspase 3, p53, antiapoptotic marker bcl2, and bax/bcl-2 ratio), DNA fragmentation, and release of steroid hormones and IGF-I were analyzed by RT‒qPCR, Trypan blue exclusion test, quantitative immunocytochemistry, XTT assay, TUNEL assay, and ELISA. The suppression of VCL activity inhibited cell viability, the accumulation of the proliferation-related proteins PCNA and cyclin B1, the antiapoptotic protein bcl2, and the proportion of proliferative active cells. Moreover, VCL siRNA inhibited the release of progesterone, estradiol, and IGF-1. VCL siRNA increased the proportion of the proapoptotic proteins bax, caspase 3, p53, the proportion of DNA fragmented cells, and stimulated testosterone release. Taken together, the present study is the first evidence that inhibition of VCL suppresses porcine granulosa cell functions. Moreover, the results suggest that VCL can be a potent physiological stimulator of ovarian functions.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the major cardiovascular diseases caused by diminished supply of nutrients and oxygen to the heart due to obstruction of the coronary artery. Different treatment options are available for cardiac diseases, however, they do not completely repair the damage. Therefore, reprogramming terminally differentiated fibroblasts using transcription factors is a promising strategy to differentiate them into cardiac like cells in vitro and to increase functional cardiomyocytes and reduce fibrotic scar in vivo. In this study, skin fibroblasts were selected for reprogramming because they serve as a convenient source for the autologous cell therapy. Fibroblasts were isolated from skin of rat pups, propagated, and directly reprogrammed towards cardiac lineage. For reprogramming, two different approaches were adopted, i.e., cells were transfected with: (1) combination of cardiac transcription factors; GATA4, MEF2c, Nkx2.5 (GMN), and (2) combination of cardiac transcription factors; GATA4, MEF2c, Nkx2.5, and iPSC factors; Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and cMyc (GMNO). After 72 h of transfection, cells were analyzed for the expression of cardiac markers at the mRNA and protein levels. For in vivo study, rat MI models were developed by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery and the reprogrammed cells were transplanted in the infarcted heart. qPCR results showed that the reprogrammed cells exhibited significant upregulation of cardiac genes. Immunocytochemistry analysis further confirmed cardiomyogenic differentiation of the reprogrammed cells. For the assessment of cardiac function, animals were analyzed via echocardiography after 2 and 4 weeks of cell transplantation. Echocardiographic results showed that the hearts transplanted with the reprogrammed cells improved ejection fraction, fractional shortening, left ventricular internal systolic and diastolic dimensions, and end systolic and diastolic volumes. After 4 weeks of cell transplantation, heart tissues were harvested and processed for histology. The histological analysis showed that the reprogrammed cells improved wall thickness of left ventricle and reduced fibrosis significantly as compared to the control. It is concluded from the study that novel combination of cardiac transcription factors directly reprogrammed skin fibroblasts and differentiated them into cardiomyocytes. These differentiated cells showed cardiomyogenic characters in vitro, and reduced fibrosis and improved cardiac function in vivo. Furthermore, direct reprogramming of fibroblasts transfected with cardiac transcription factors showed better regeneration of the injured myocardium and improved cardiac function as compared to the indirect approach in which combination of cardiac and iPSC factors were used. The study after further optimization could be used as a better strategy for cell-based therapeutic approaches for cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: The expression of costimulatory molecules such as MHC-II, CD86 and CD83 on dendritic cells (DCs) are strongly regulated during cellular activation. Ubiquitination of some of these markers by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH-I affects the maturation state of DCs and subsequently modulates immune responses. The effects of MARCH-I gene overexpression on the functional activity of human DCs is not well understood. Here, we investigate how MARCH-I, regulates maturation of DCs. We now provide evidence that MARCH-I transduced DCs secrete high levels of IL10 despite low secretion of IL 6 and IL 12 in response to LPS stimulation. They are weak stimulators of T lymphocyte cells but skewed T cell polarization toward T regulatory subset. These results exhibit that reduced expression of surface costimulatory molecules suppresses DC activation. It can be concluded that overexpression of MARCH-I gene in DCs leads to the production of tolerogenic DC.

Abstract: Summary
Although a high amount of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is associated with low plasma triglyceride concentration, the mechanism responsible for this relationship in people is not clear. Here, we evaluate the interrelationships among BAT, very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL-TG), and free fatty acid (FFA) plasma kinetics during thermoneutrality in women with overweight/obesity who had a low (<20 mL) or high (≥20 mL) volume of cold-activated BAT (assessed by using positron emission tomography in conjunction with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-glucose). We find that plasma TG and FFA concentrations are lower and VLDL-TG and FFA plasma clearance rates are faster in women with high BAT than low BAT volume, whereas VLDL-TG and FFA appearance rates in plasma are not different between the two groups. These findings demonstrate that women with high BAT volume have lower plasma TG and FFA concentrations than women with low BAT volumes because of increased VLDL-TG and FFA clearance rates. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02786251).

Abstract: Summary
Despite considerable efforts to identify human liver cancer genomic alterations that might unveil druggable targets, the systematic translation of multiomics data remains challenging. Here, we report success in long-term culture of 64 patient-derived hepatobiliary tumor organoids (PDHOs) from a Chinese population. A divergent response to 265 metabolism- and epigenetics-related chemicals and 36 anti-cancer drugs is observed. Integration of the whole genome, transcriptome, chromatin accessibility profiles, and drug sensitivity results of 64 clinically relevant drugs defines over 32,000 genome-drug interactions. RUNX1 promoter mutation is associated with an increase in chromatin accessibility and a concomitant gene expression increase, promoting a cluster of drugs preferentially sensitive in hepatobiliary tumors. These results not only provide an annotated PDHO biobank of human liver cancer but also suggest a systematic approach for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the gene-regulatory network of liver cancer, advancing the applications of potential personalized medicine.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular and immunological properties of tissue-resident resting CD4 T cells are understudied due to the lack of suitable gene editing methods. Here, we describe the ex vivo culture and gene editing methodology ediTONSIL for CD4 T cells from human tonsils. Optimized CRISPR-Cas9 RNP nucleofection results in knockout efficacies of over 90% without requiring exogenous activation. Editing can be performed on multiple cell types in bulk cultures or on isolated CD4 T cells that can be labeled and reintroduced into their tissue environment. Importantly, CD4 T cells maintain their tissue-specific properties such as viability, activation state, or immunocompetence following reassembly into lymphoid aggregates. This highly efficient and versatile gene editing workflow for tonsillar CD4 T cells enables the dissection of molecular mechanisms in ex vivo cultures of human lymphoid tissue and can be adapted to other tonsil-resident cell types.

Abstract: Summary
A tumor ecosystem constantly evolves over time in the face of immune predation or therapeutic intervention, resulting in treatment failure and tumor progression. Here, we present a single-cell transcriptome-based strategy to determine the evolution of longitudinal tumor biopsies from liver cancer patients by measuring cellular lineage and ecology. We construct a lineage and ecological score as joint dynamics of tumor cells and their microenvironments. Tumors may be classified into four main states in the lineage-ecological space, which are associated with clinical outcomes. Analysis of longitudinal samples reveals the evolutionary trajectory of tumors in response to treatment. We validate the lineage-ecology-based scoring system in predicting clinical outcomes using bulk transcriptomic data of additional cohorts of 716 liver cancer patients. Our study provides a framework for monitoring tumor evolution in response to therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor MPL play crucial roles in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and platelet production. However, the precise effects of TPO/MPL signaling on HSC regulation in different hematopoietic niches remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of TPO/MPL ablation on marrow and splenic hematopoiesis in TPO−/− and MPL−/− mice during aging. Despite severe thrombocytopenia, TPO−/− and MPL−/− mice did not develop marrow failure during a 2-year follow-up. Marrow and splenic HSCs exhibited different responses to TPO/MPL ablation and exogenous TPO treatment. Splenic niche cells compensated for marrow HSC loss in TPO−/− and MPL−/− mice by upregulating CXCL12 levels. These findings provide new insights into the complex regulation of HSCs by TPO/MPL and reveal a previously unknown link between TPO and CXCL12, two key growth factors for HSC maintenance. Understanding the distinct regulatory mechanisms between marrow and spleen hematopoiesis will help to develop novel therapeutic approaches for hematopoietic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are influenced by litter inputs, but the impact of these inputs is uncertain. This study addresses this gap by conducting a meta-analysis of 115 published articles to investigate the global responses of soil GHG fluxes to altered litter inputs and the potential factors that drive these responses. The findings suggest that litter changes significantly influence soil GHG fluxes, such that litter removal greatly decreases soil CO2 and N2O emissions, while doubling the amount of litter significantly enhances soil CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. Also, the impact of litter on soil CO2 and N2O fluxes is affected by other factors such as ecosystem type, climatic factors, soil pH, and litter quality. These findings have important implications for climate change mitigation and sustainable soil management.

Abstract: Summary
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness featuring pathogenic neovascularization of the choroidal vasculature (CNV). Although systemic immunity plays a role in AMD, the ocular signals that recruit and activate immune cells remain poorly defined. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we prospectively profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 65 individuals including AMD and controls, which we integrate with existing choroid data. We generate a network of choroid-peripheral immune interactions dysregulated in AMD, including known AMD-relevant gene vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2. Additionally, we find CYR61 is upregulated in choroidal veins and may signal to circulating monocytes. In mice, we validate that CYR61 is abundant in endothelial cells within CNV lesions neighboring monocyte-derived macrophages. Mechanistically, CYR61 activates macrophage anti-angiogenic gene expression, and ocular Cyr61 knockdown increases murine CNV size, indicating CYR61 inhibits CNV. This study highlights the potential of multi-tissue human datasets to identify disease-relevant and potentially therapeutically modifiable targets.

Abstract: Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient in organisms and an abundant element in the Earth's crust. Trace amounts of Zn released from natural sources can enter aquatic ecosystems through weathering and erosion. Zn accumulates in organisms, and when its intracellular concentration exceeds a certain level, it can induce oxidative stress and trigger oxidative stress-mediated heat shock protein (HSP) modulation. HSP70 is the most evolutionarily conserved among the HSP families. Despite extensive research on HSP70 genes in bivalves, the HSP70 gene family of Tegillarca granosa is still poorly characterized. We identified 65 HSP70 genes belonging to 6 families in the T. granosa genome, with 50 HSPa12 and 11 HSPa B2 genes highly expanded. On chromosome 11, 39 HSP70 (60%) genes were identified, and the HSPa12A genes were highly duplicated. A total of 527 and 538 differentially expressed genes were identified in the gills and mantle based on Zn exposure, respectively. The Gene Ontology of cellular anatomical entities was significantly enriched with upregulated differentially expressed genes in the gills and mantle. Eight of the 11 HSPa B2 genes were upregulated in both tissues. Most of the genes identified in both tissues were involved in “protein homeostasis” and “inhibition of apoptosis,” which are associated with the HSP70 family's resistance to extrinsic and intrinsic stress. Hence, this study identified that the HSP70 gene family plays a vital role in the adaptation of aquatic organisms to heavy metal (e.g., Zn) stress in contaminated environments by compiling the different physiological responses to preserve homeostasis.

Abstract: Drosophila geneticists frequently employ the binary GAL4-UAS system of conditional gene expression to direct expression of the desired transgene in tissues of interest. The inscuteable -GAL4 driver (insc-GAL4) expresses in the type 1 and type 2 neuroblasts of Drosophila larval brain, a frequent target tissue in many investigations. This GAL4 line additionally displayed its expression in the midgut. In this study, we examined the expression of the UAS-mCD8GFP reporter under the command of the insc-GAL4 driver and observed that this driver expresses exclusively to intestinal stem cells (ISCs) of the Drosophila adult midgut as well as adult midgut precursors (AMPs) of the larval midgut besides its expression in larval brain. Additionally, using the G-TRACE method, it was observed that AMPs in the larval midgut consistently expressed insc-GAL4 in real-time, and the lineage expression of this GAL4 was observed in the enterocyte cells. This study reveals for the first time that insc-GAL4 is specific to larval AMPs and adult ISCs of the midgut.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with enhanced transmissibility and immune escape have emerged periodically throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but the impact of these variants on disease severity has remained unclear. In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, we examined the association between SARS-CoV-2 clade and patient outcome over a two-year period in Chicago, Illinois. Between March 2020 and March 2022, 14,252 residual diagnostic specimens were collected from SARS-CoV-2-positive inpatients and outpatients alongside linked clinical and demographic metadata, of which 2,114 were processed for viral whole-genome sequencing. When controlling for patient demographics and vaccination status, several viral clades were associated with risk for hospitalization, but this association was negated by the inclusion of population-level confounders, including case count, sampling bias, and shifting standards of care. These data highlight the importance of integrating non-virological factors into disease severity and outcome models for the accurate assessment of patient risk.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can function as negative regulators of gene expression by binding to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of target genes. The aberrant expression of miRNAs in neoplasm is extensively associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Our previous investigation has identified the oncogenic roles of Peroxiredoxin2 (PRDX2) in ESCC progression; however, its upstream regulatory mechanism remains to be elucidated. By merging the prediction results from miRWalk2.0 and miRNA differential expression analysis results based on The Cancer Genome Atlas Esophageal Carcinoma (TCGA-ESCA) database, eight miRNA candidates were predicted to be the potential regulatory miRNAs of PRDX2, followed by further identification of miR-92a-2-5p as the putative miRNA of PRDX2. Subsequent functional studies demonstrated that miR-92a-2-5p can suppress ESCC cell proliferation and migration, as well as tumor growth in subcutaneous tumor xenograft models, which might be mediated by the suppression of AKT/mTOR and Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathways upon miR-92a-2-5p mimic transfection condition. These data revealed the tumor suppressive functions of miR-92a-2-5p in ESCC by targeting PRDX2.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding cancer immunobiology has been hampered by difficulty identifying cancer-specific T cells. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) causes most Merkel cell carcinomas (MCCs). All patients with virus-driven MCC express MCPyV oncoproteins, facilitating identification of virus (cancer)-specific T cells. We studied MCPyV-specific T cells from 27 patients with MCC using MCPyV peptide-HLA-I multimers, 26-color flow cytometry, single-cell transcriptomics, and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. In a prospective clinical trial, higher circulating MCPyV-specific CD8 T cell frequency before anti-PD-1 treatment was strongly associated with 2-year recurrence-free survival (75% if detectable, 0% if undetectable, p = 0.0018; ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT02488759). Intratumorally, such T cells were typically present, but their frequency did not significantly associate with response. Circulating MCPyV-specific CD8 T cells had increased stem/memory and decreased exhaustion signatures relative to their intratumoral counterparts. These results suggest that cancer-specific CD8 T cells in the blood may play a role in anti-PD-1 responses. Thus, strategies that augment their number or mobilize them into tumors could improve outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Prenatal dexamethasone exposure (PDE) can lead to increased susceptibility to various diseases in adult offspring, but its effect on gut microbiota composition and the relationship with disease susceptibility remains unclear. In this study, we find sex-differential changes in the gut microbiota of 6-month-old infants with prenatal dexamethasone therapy (PDT) that persisted in female infants up to 2.5 years of age with altered bile acid metabolism. PDE female offspring rats show abnormal colonization and composition of gut microbiota and increased susceptibility to cholestatic liver injury. The aberrant gut microbiota colonization in the PDE offspring can be attributed to the inhibited Muc2 expression caused by decreased CDX2 expression before and after birth. Integrating animal and cell experiments, we further confirm that dexamethasone could inhibit Muc2 expression by activating GR/HDAC11 signaling and regulating CDX2 epigenetic modification. This study interprets abnormal gut microbiota and disease susceptibility in PDT offspring from intrauterine intestinal dysplasia.

Abstract: Summary
Merkel cell carcinoma is a skin cancer often driven by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) with high rates of response to anti-PD-1 therapy despite low mutational burden. MCPyV-specific CD8 T cells are implicated in anti-PD-1-associated immune responses and provide a means to directly study tumor-specific T cell responses to treatment. Using mass cytometry and combinatorial tetramer staining, we find that baseline frequencies of blood MCPyV-specific cells correlated with response and survival. Frequencies of these cells decrease markedly during response to therapy. Phenotypes of MCPyV-specific CD8 T cells have distinct expression patterns of CD39, cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA), and CD103. Correspondingly, overall bulk CD39+CLA+ CD8 T cell frequencies in blood correlate with MCPyV-specific cell frequencies and similarly predicted favorable clinical outcomes. Conversely, frequencies of CD39+CD103+ CD8 T cells are associated with tumor burden and worse outcomes. These cell subsets can be useful as biomarkers and to isolate blood-derived tumor-specific T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Several bacterial pathogens, including Salmonella enterica, can cause persistent infections in humans by mechanisms that are poorly understood. By comparing genomes of isolates longitudinally collected from 256 prolonged salmonellosis patients, we identified repeated mutations in global regulators, including the barA/sirA two-component regulatory system, across multiple patients and Salmonella serovars. Comparative RNA-seq analysis revealed that distinct mutations in barA/sirA led to diminished expression of Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 4 genes, which are required for Salmonella invasion and enteritis. Moreover, barA/sirA mutants were attenuated in an acute salmonellosis mouse model and induced weaker transcription of host immune responses. In contrast, in a persistent infection mouse model, these mutants exhibited long-term colonization and prolonged shedding. Taken together, these findings suggest that selection of mutations in global virulence regulators facilitates persistent Salmonella infection in humans, by attenuating Salmonella virulence and inducing a weaker host inflammatory response.

Abstract: Summary
In plant immunity, phosphatidic acid (PA) regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) by binding to respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RBOHD), an NADPH oxidase responsible for ROS production. Here, we analyze the influence of PA binding on RBOHD activity and the mechanism of RBOHD-bound PA generation. PA binding enhances RBOHD protein stability by inhibiting vacuolar degradation, thereby increasing chitin-induced ROS production. Mutations in diacylglycerol kinase 5 (DGK5), which phosphorylates diacylglycerol to produce PA, impair chitin-induced PA and ROS production. The DGK5 transcript DGK5β (but not DGK5α) complements reduced PA and ROS production in dgk5-1 mutants, as well as resistance to Botrytis cinerea. Phosphorylation of S506 residue in the C-terminal calmodulin-binding domain of DGK5β contributes to the activation of DGK5β to produce PA. These findings suggest that DGK5β-derived PA regulates ROS production by inhibiting RBOHD protein degradation, elucidating the role of PA-ROS interplay in immune response regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by extremely poor prognosis. PDAC presents with molecularly distinct subtypes, with the basal-like one being associated with enhanced chemoresistance. Splicing dysregulation contributes to PDAC; however, its involvement in subtype specification remains elusive. Herein, we uncover a subtype-specific splicing signature associated with prognosis in PDAC and the splicing factor Quaking (QKI) as a determinant of the basal-like signature. Single-cell sequencing analyses highlight QKI as a marker of the basal-like phenotype. QKI represses splicing events associated with the classical subtype while promoting basal-like events associated with shorter survival. QKI favors a plastic, quasi-mesenchymal phenotype that supports migration and chemoresistance in PDAC organoids and cell lines, and its expression is elevated in high-grade primary tumors and metastatic lesions. These studies identify a splicing signature that defines PDAC subtypes and indicate that QKI promotes an undifferentiated, plastic phenotype, which renders PDAC cells chemoresistant and adaptable to environmental changes.

Abstract: Summary
Successful allogeneic human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived therapies must overcome immunological rejection by the recipient. To build reagents to define these barriers, we genetically ablated β2M, TAP1, CIITA, CD74, MICA, and MICB to limit expression of HLA-I, HLA-II, and natural killer (NK) cell activating ligands in hPSCs. Transplantation of these cells that also expressed covalent single chain trimers of Qa1 and H2-Kb to inhibit NK cells and CD55, Crry, and CD59 to inhibit complement deposition led to persistent teratomas in wild-type mice. Transplantation of HLA-deficient hPSCs into mice genetically deficient in complement and depleted of NK cells also led to persistent teratomas. Thus, T cell, NK cell, and complement evasion are necessary to prevent immunological rejection of hPSCs and their progeny. These cells and versions expressing human orthologs of immune evasion factors can be used to define cell type-specific immune barriers and conduct preclinical testing in immunocompetent mouse models.

Abstract: Summary
Cereblon (CRBN) is an E3 ligase substrate adapter widely exploited for targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategies. However, achieving efficient and selective target degradation is a preeminent challenge with ligands that engage CRBN. Here, we report that the cyclimids, ligands derived from the C-terminal cyclic imide degrons of CRBN, exhibit distinct modes of interaction with CRBN and offer a facile approach for developing potent and selective bifunctional degraders. Quantitative TR-FRET-based characterization of 60 cyclimid degraders in binary and ternary complexes across different substrates revealed that ternary complex binding affinities correlated strongly with cellular degradation efficiency. Our studies establish the unique properties of the cyclimids as versatile warheads in TPD and a systematic biochemical approach for quantifying ternary complex formation to predict their cellular degradation activity, which together will accelerate the development of ligands that engage CRBN.

Abstract: Summary
We have developed an open-source workflow that allows for quantitative single-cell analysis of organelle morphology, distribution, and inter-organelle contacts with an emphasis on the analysis of mitochondria and mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (mito-ER) contact sites. As the importance of inter-organelle contacts becomes more widely recognized, there is a concomitant increase in demand for tools to analyze subcellular architecture. Here, we describe a workflow we call MitER (pronounced “mightier”), which allows for automated calculation of organelle morphology, distribution, and inter-organelle contacts from 3D renderings by employing the animation software Blender. We then use MitER to quantify the variations in the mito-ER networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, revealing significantly more mito-ER contacts within respiring cells compared to fermenting cells. We then demonstrate how this workflow can be applied to mammalian systems and used to monitor mitochondrial dynamics and inter-organelle contact in time-lapse studies.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroendocrine carcinomas, such as neuroendocrine prostate cancer and small-cell lung cancer, commonly have a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. We report that ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), a deubiquitinating enzyme, is elevated in tissues and plasma from patients with neuroendocrine carcinomas. Loss of UCHL1 decreases tumor growth and inhibits metastasis of these malignancies. UCHL1 maintains neuroendocrine differentiation and promotes cancer progression by regulating nucleoporin, POM121, and p53. UCHL1 binds, deubiquitinates, and stabilizes POM121 to regulate POM121-associated nuclear transport of E2F1 and c-MYC. Treatment with the UCHL1 inhibitor LDN-57444 slows tumor growth and metastasis across neuroendocrine carcinomas. The combination of UCHL1 inhibitors with cisplatin, the standard of care used for neuroendocrine carcinomas, significantly delays tumor growth in pre-clinical settings. Our study reveals mechanisms of UCHL1 function in regulating the progression of neuroendocrine carcinomas and identifies UCHL1 as a therapeutic target and potential molecular indicator for diagnosing and monitoring treatment responses in these malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroscience is moving toward a more integrative discipline where understanding brain function requires consolidating the accumulated evidence seen across experiments, species, and measurement techniques. A remaining challenge on that path is integrating such heterogeneous data into analysis workflows such that consistent and comparable conclusions can be distilled as an experimental basis for models and theories. Here, we propose a solution in the context of slow-wave activity (<1 Hz), which occurs during unconscious brain states like sleep and general anesthesia and is observed across diverse experimental approaches. We address the issue of integrating and comparing heterogeneous data by conceptualizing a general pipeline design that is adaptable to a variety of inputs and applications. Furthermore, we present the Collaborative Brain Wave Analysis Pipeline (Cobrawap) as a concrete, reusable software implementation to perform broad, detailed, and rigorous comparisons of slow-wave characteristics across multiple, openly available electrocorticography (ECoG) and calcium imaging datasets.

Abstract: Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death process, play an important role in myocardial ischemia‒reperfusion (I/R) injury. Glycyrrhizin (GL), a natural glycoconjugate triterpene, has the property to improve growth rate, immune regulation, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory. However, whether GL can attenuate myocardial I/R injury by modulating ferroptosis or other mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, SD rats underwent in vivo myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) surgery, while H9C2 cells were subjected to the hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model for in vitro experiments. In addition, TAK-242, a TLR4-specific antagonist, and GL were also used to evaluate the effect and mechanisms of GL on the cardiac function and expression of ferroptosis-related gene and protein in vivo and vitro. The results show that GL decreased not only the expression of the inflammation-related factors (HMGB1, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-18 and IL-1β), but also reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes, and mitigated pathological alterations in I/R injury. In addition, GL decreased the levels of MDA, promoted antioxidant capacity such as GSH, CAT, Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, and SOD in vivo and vitro. More importantly, GL and TAK-242 regulate ferroptosis-related protein and gene expression in I/R and H/R model. Surprisingly, GL may ameliorate cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and ultimately improves cardiac function induced by H/R via the HMGB1-TLR4-GPX4 axis. Therefore, we have highlighted a novel mechanism by which GL regulates inflammation, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis via the HMGB1-TLR4-GPX4 pathway to prevent myocardial I/R injury. GL appears to be a potentially applicable drug for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury.

Abstract: Summary
Reproducible functional assays to study in vitro neuronal networks represent an important cornerstone in the quest to develop physiologically relevant cellular models of human diseases. Here, we introduce DeePhys, a MATLAB-based analysis tool for data-driven functional phenotyping of in vitro neuronal cultures recorded by high-density microelectrode arrays. DeePhys is a modular workflow that offers a range of techniques to extract features from spike-sorted data, allowing for the examination of functional phenotypes both at the individual cell and network levels, as well as across development. In addition, DeePhys incorporates the capability to integrate novel features and to use machine-learning-assisted approaches, which facilitates a comprehensive evaluation of pharmacological interventions. To illustrate its practical application, we apply DeePhys to human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived dopaminergic neurons obtained from both patients and healthy individuals and showcase how DeePhys enables phenotypic screenings.

Abstract: Summary
Drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains a major public health concern requiring complementary approaches to standard anti-tuberculous regimens. Anti-virulence molecules or compounds that enhance the activity of antimicrobial prodrugs are promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Exploiting host cell-based drug discovery, we identified an oxadiazole compound (S3) that blocks the ESX-1 secretion system, a major virulence factor of Mtb. S3-treated mycobacteria showed impaired intracellular growth and a reduced ability to lyse macrophages. RNA sequencing experiments of drug-exposed bacteria revealed strong upregulation of a distinct set of genes including ethA, encoding a monooxygenase activating the anti-tuberculous prodrug ethionamide. Accordingly, we found a strong ethionamide boosting effect in S3-treated Mtb. Extensive structure-activity relationship experiments revealed that anti-virulence and ethionamide-boosting activity can be uncoupled by chemical modification of the primary hit molecule. To conclude, this series of dual-active oxadiazole compounds targets Mtb via two distinct mechanisms of action.

Abstract: Summary
The failure of the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) IsdB vaccine trial can be explained by the recall of non-protective immune imprints from prior SA exposure. Here, we investigate natural human SA humoral imprints to understand their broader impact on SA immunizations. We show that antibody responses against SA cell-wall-associated antigens (CWAs) are non-opsonic, while antibodies against SA toxins are neutralizing. Importantly, the protective characteristics of the antibody imprints accurately predict the failure of corresponding vaccines against CWAs and support vaccination against toxins. In passive immunization platforms, natural anti-SA human antibodies reduce the efficacy of the human monoclonal antibodies suvratoxumab and tefibazumab, consistent with the results of their respective clinical trials. Strikingly, in the absence of specific humoral memory responses, active immunizations are efficacious in both naive and SA-experienced mice. Overall, our study points to a practical and predictive approach to evaluate and develop SA vaccines based on pre-existing humoral imprint characteristics.

Abstract: Cervical cancer (CC), as a common female malignant tumor in the world, is an important risk factor endangering women's health worldwide. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of RBM15 in CC. The TCGA database was used to screen differentially expressed m6A genes in normal and tumor tissues. QRT-PCR was used to quantify HEIH, miR-802, EGFR, cell stemness, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. The interaction between HEIH and miR-802 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay. The occurrence of tumor cells after different treatments was detected by CCK-8, transwell and EdU staining. BALB/c nude mice were used to examine the effects of different treatments on tumor growth and cell stemness in vivo. RBM15 was upregulated in tumor tissues and cells. M6A was highly enriched in HEIH and enhances its RNA stability. HEIH acts as an oncogenic lncRNA to promote CC cell proliferation, migration and tumor growth. Mechanistically, HEIH regulates tumor cell stemness and promotes the proliferation and migration of CC cells by competitively adsorbing miR-802 and up-regulating the expression of EGFR. In short, our data shown that the m6A methyltransferase RBM15 could affect tumor cell proliferation, metastasis and cell stemness by stabilizing HEIH expression.

Abstract: Purpose
This study aims to identify the potential necroptosis related genes (NRGs)-associated miRNAs signature and explore the impact on the prognosis of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD).
Methods
Employing rigorous methodologies, we utilized univariate Cox, Lasso and multivariate Cox regression analyses to develop a prognostic signature. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) and ROC curves were applied to assess the prognostic value of signature in a training group and an independent test group. Furthermore, we conducted Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for enrichment of tumor-related pathways. The risk score was calculated for each patient based on the expression of miRNAs which were enrolled in the signature. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups. The immune cell infiltration and immunotherapy were compared between the two groups. Finally, the diagnostic potential of the miRNA was explored by RT-qPCR.
Results
We constructed a prognostic model based on 6 NRGs-associated miRNAs. K-M plots underscored superior survival outcomes in the low-risk group. GSEA results revealed the enrichment of several tumor-related pathways in the high-risk group. Notably, CD8+ T cells, Tregs and activated memory CD4+ T cells exhibited negative correlations with the risk score. Additionally, a few immune checkpoint genes, such as CTLA4, PD1 and PD-L1, were significantly upregulated in the low-risk group. Furthermore, the serum expression levels of all these 6 miRNAs were significantly elevated in STAD patients.
Conclusions
Our study identified a robust risk score derived from a signature of 6 NRGs-associated miRNAs, demonstrating high efficacy for prognosis of STAD. These results not only contributed to our understanding of STAD pathogenesis, but also held promise for potential clinical applications, particularly in the realm of personalized immunotherapy for STAD patients.

Abstract: Lung carcinoma (LC) is a complicated and highly heterogeneous disease with high morbidity and mortality. Both lysyl oxidase-like (LOXL) 2 and 3 act in cancer progression. This work endeavors to illustrate the influence of LOXL2/LOXL3 on LC progression and the underlying mechanisms. LOXL family genes and CCAAT enhancer binding protein A (CEBPA) were analyzed in the TCGA database for their expression patterns in LC patients and their correlations with the patient's prognosis. CEBPA, LOXL2, and LOXL3 expression levels were determined in LC cells. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were conducted, followed by assays for cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), apoptosis, invasion, and migration. The binding of CEBPA or B cell lymphoma protein (BCL)-2 to LOXL2/LOXL3 was verified. The ubiquitination level of BCL-2 and histone acetylation level of LOXL2/LOXL3 in LC cells were analyzed. Database analyses revealed that LC patients had high CEBPA, LOXL2, and LOXL3 expression, which were related to poor prognosis. LC cells also exhibited high CEBPA, LOXL2, and LOXL3 levels. LOXL2/LOXL3 knockdown subdued EMT, proliferation, migration, and invasion while enhancing the apoptosis of LC cells. LOXL2/LOXL3 could bind to CEBPA and BCL-2. LOXL2/LOXL3 knockdown upregulated BCL-2 ubiquitination level and diminished BCL-2 expression in LC cells. CEBPA recruited Tip60 to enhance histone acetylation and transcription of LOXL2/LOXL3 in LC cells. BCL-2 overexpression abolished the impacts of LOXL2/LOXL3 knockdown on LC cells. In conclusion, CEBPA boosts LOXL2 and LOXL3 transcription to facilitate BCL-2 stability by recruiting Tip60 and thus contributes to LC cell growth and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
The recurrent variant KCNC1-p.Arg320His causes progressive myoclonus epilepsy (EPM) type 7, defined by progressive myoclonus, epilepsy, and ataxia, and is without effective treatment. KCNC1 encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv3.1, specifically expressed in high-frequency-firing neurons. Variant subunits act via loss of function; hence, EPM7 pathogenesis may involve impaired excitability of Kv3.1-expressing neurons, while enhancing Kv3 activity could represent a viable therapeutic strategy. We generate a mouse model, Kcnc1-p.Arg320His/+, which recapitulates the core features of EPM7, including progressive ataxia and seizure susceptibility. Kv3.1-expressing cerebellar granule cells and neocortical parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons exhibit abnormalities consistent with Kv3 channel dysfunction. A Kv3-specific positive modulator (AUT00206) selectively enhances the firing frequency of Kv3.1-expressing neurons and improves motor function and seizure susceptibility in Kcnc1-Arg320His/+ mice. This work identifies a cellular and circuit basis of dysfunction in EPM7 and demonstrates that Kv3 positive modulators such as AUT00206 have therapeutic potential for the treatment of EPM7.

Abstract: Summary
In this study, we develop a 3D beta variational autoencoder (beta-VAE) to advance lung cancer imaging analysis, countering the constraints of conventional radiomics methods. The autoencoder extracts information from public lung computed tomography (CT) datasets without additional labels. It reconstructs 3D lung nodule images with high quality (structural similarity: 0.774, peak signal-to-noise ratio: 26.1, and mean-squared error: 0.0008). The model effectively encodes lesion sizes in its latent embeddings, with a significant correlation with lesion size found after applying uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction. Additionally, the beta-VAE can synthesize new lesions of varying sizes by manipulating the latent features. The model can predict multiple clinical endpoints, including pathological N stage or KRAS mutation status, on the Stanford radiogenomics lung cancer dataset. Comparisons with other methods show that the beta-VAE performs equally well in these tasks, suggesting its potential as a pretrained model for predicting patient outcomes in medical imaging.

Abstract: Summary
Coral reefs underpin the environmental, social, and economic fabrics of much of the world's tropical coast. Yet, the fine-scale distribution and composition of coral reefs have never been reported consistently across the planet. Here, we present new area estimates enabled by global geomorphic zone and benthic substrate maps at 5 m pixel resolution. We revise global coral reef estimates to 348,361 km2 of shallow coral reefs and 80,213 km2 (46,237–106,319 km2, 95% confidence interval) of coral habitat. The mapping used more than 1.5 million training samples supported by 480+ data contributions to deploy a coral reef classification of over 100 trillion pixels from the Sentinel-2 satellites and the Planet Dove CubeSat constellation. The publicly available maps are accessible via the Allen Coral Atlas and Google Earth Engine and are already being used by thousands of people to improve the conservation, management, and research of coral reef ecosystems.

Abstract: Summary
The (poly)pharmacology of drug metabolites is seldom comprehensively characterized in drug discovery. However, some drug metabolites can reach high plasma concentrations and display in vivo activity. Here, we use computational and experimental methods to comprehensively characterize the kinase polypharmacology of M324, the major metabolite of the PARP1 inhibitor rucaparib. We demonstrate that M324 displays unique PLK2 inhibition at clinical concentrations. This kinase activity could have implications for the efficacy and safety of rucaparib and therefore warrants further clinical investigation. Importantly, we identify synergy between the drug and the metabolite in prostate cancer models and a complete reduction of α-synuclein accumulation in Parkinson’s disease models. These activities could be harnessed in the clinic or open new drug discovery opportunities. The study reported here highlights the importance of characterizing the activity of drug metabolites to comprehensively understand drug response in the clinic and exploit our current drug arsenal in precision medicine.
