Abstract: Acute fluoride (F−) toxicity is known to cause severe cardiac complications and leads to sudden heart failure. Previously, we reported that increased myocardial oxidative damage, apoptosis, altered cytoskeleton and AMPK signaling proteins associated with energy deprivation in acute F− induced cardiac dysfunction. The present study was aimed to decipher the status of myocardial heat shock proteins (Hsps-Hsp27, Hsp32, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp90) and heat shock transcription factor 1 (Hsf1) in acute F−-intoxicated rats. In order to study the expression of myocardial Hsps, male Wistar rats were treated with single oral doses of 45 and 90 mg/kg F− for 24 h. The expression levels of myocardial Hsps were determined using RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical studies. Acute F−-intoxicated rats showed elevated levels of both the transcripts and protein expression of Hsf1, Hsp27, Hsp32, Hsp60, and Hsp70 when compared to control. In addition, the expression levels of Hsp40 and Hsp90 were significantly declined in a dose-dependent fashion in F−-treated animals. Our result suggests that differential expression of Hsps in the rat myocardium could serve as a balance between pro-survival and death signal during acute F−-induced heart failure.

Abstract: Summary
To dissect the cellular roles of individual kinases, it is useful to design tools for their selective activation. We describe the engineering of a split-cAbl kinase (sKin-Abl) that is rapidly activated in cells with rapamycin and allows temporal, dose, and compartmentalization control. Our design strategy involves an empirical screen in mammalian cells and identification of split site in the N lobe. This split site leads to complete loss of activity, which can be restored upon small-molecule-induced dimerization in cells. Remarkably, the split site is transportable to the related Src Tyr kinase and the distantly related Ser/Thr kinase, AKT, suggesting broader applications to kinases. To quantify the fold induction of phosphotyrosine (pTyr) modification, we employed quantitative proteomics, NeuCode SILAC. We identified a number of known Abl substrates, including autophosphorylation sites and novel pTyr targets, 432 pTyr sites in total. We believe that this split-kinase technology will be useful for direct activation of protein kinases in cells.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are regulated by epigenetic machinery. Tripartite motif protein 28 (TRIM28), a universal mediator of Krüppel-associated box domain zinc fingers (KRAB-ZNFs), is known to regulate both processes; however, the exact mechanism and identity of participating KRAB-ZNF genes remain unknown. Here, using a reporter system, we show that TRIM28/KRAB-ZNFs alter DNA methylation patterns in addition to H3K9me3 to cause stable gene repression during reprogramming. Using several expression datasets, we identified KRAB-ZNFs (ZNF114, ZNF483, ZNF589) in the human genome that maintain pluripotency. Moreover, we identified target genes repressed by these KRAB-ZNFs. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that these KRAB-ZNFs directly alter gene expression of important developmental genes by modulating H3K9me3 and DNA methylation of their promoters. In summary, TRIM28 employs KRAB-ZNFs to evoke epigenetic silencing of its target differentiation genes via H3K9me3 and DNA methylation.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular tropism during persistent viral infection is commonly conferred by the interaction of a viral surface protein with a host receptor complex. Norovirus, the leading global cause of gastroenteritis, can be persistently shed during infection, but its in vivo cellular tropism and tropism determinants remain unidentified. Using murine norovirus (MNoV), we determine that a small number of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) serve as the reservoir for fecal shedding and persistence. The viral non-structural protein NS1, rather than a viral surface protein, determines IEC tropism. Expression of NS1 from a persistent MNoV strain is sufficient for an acute MNoV strain to target IECs and persist. In addition, interferon-lambda (IFN-λ) is a key host determinant blocking MNoV infection in IECs. The inability of acute MNoV to shed and persist is rescued in Ifnlr1−/− mice, suggesting that NS1 evades IFN-λ-mediated antiviral immunity. Thus, NS1 and IFN-λ interactions govern IEC tropism and persistence of MNoV.

Abstract: Summary
Wilms' tumor suppressor 1 (WT1) plays an important role in cell proliferation and mesenchymal-epithelial balance in normal development and disease. Here, we show that following podocyte depletion in three experimental models, and in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and membranous nephropathy, WT1 increased significantly in cells of renin lineage (CoRL). In an animal model of FSGS in RenWt1fl/fl reporter mice with inducible deletion of WT1 in CoRL, CoRL proliferation and migration to the glomerulus was reduced, and glomerular disease was worse compared with wild-type mice. To become podocytes, CoRL undergo mesenchymal-to-epithelial transformation (MET), typified by reduced staining for mesenchymal markers (MYH11, SM22, αSMA) and de novo expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and cytokeratin18). Evidence for changes in MET markers was barely detected in RenWt1fl/fl mice. Our results show that following podocyte depletion, WT1 plays essential roles in CoRL proliferation and migration toward an adult podocyte fate.

Abstract: Summary
Ceramides and their metabolites are important for the homeostasis of the epidermis, but much remains unknown about the roles of specific pathways of ceramide metabolism in skin biology. With a mouse model deficient in the alkaline ceramidase (Acer1) gene, we demonstrate that ACER1 plays a key role in the homeostasis of the epidermis and its appendages by controlling the metabolism of ceramides. Loss of Acer1 elevated the levels of various ceramides and sphingoid bases in the skin and caused progressive hair loss in mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that loss of Acer1 widened follicular infundibulum and caused progressive loss of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) due to reduced survival and stemness. These results suggest that ACER1 plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of HFSCs, and thereby the hair follicle structure and function, by regulating the metabolism of ceramides in the epidermis.

Abstract: Summary
All viruses with positive-sense RNA genomes replicate on membranous structures in the cytoplasm called replication complexes (RCs). RCs provide an advantageous microenvironment for viral replication, but it is unknown how the host immune system counteracts these structures. Here we show that interferon-gamma (IFNG) disrupts the RC of murine norovirus (MNV) via evolutionarily conserved autophagy proteins and the induction of IFN-inducible GTPases, which are known to destroy the membrane of vacuoles containing bacteria, protists, or fungi. The MNV RC was marked by the microtubule-associated-protein-1-light-chain-3 (LC3) conjugation system of autophagy and then targeted by immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) and guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) upon their induction by IFNG. Further, the LC3 conjugation system and the IFN-inducible GTPases were necessary to inhibit MNV replication in mice and human cells. These data suggest that viral RCs can be marked and antagonized by a universal immune defense mechanism targeting diverse pathogens replicating in cytosolic membrane structures.

Abstract: Neural stem cells (NSCs) have exhibited promising potential in therapies against neuronal hearing loss. Ferulic acid (FA) has been widely reported to enhance neurogenic differentiation of different stem cells. We investigated the role of FA in promoting NSC transplant therapy to prevent gentamicin-induced neuronal hearing loss. NSCs were isolated from mouse cochlear tissues to establish in vitro culture, which were then treated with FA. The survival and differentiation of NSCs were evaluated. Subsequently, neurite outgrowth and excitability of the in vitro neuronal network were assessed. Gentamicin was used to induce neuronal hearing loss in mice, in the presence and absence of FA, followed by assessments of auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product optoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) amplitude. FA promoted survival, neurosphere formation and differentiation of NSCs, as well as neurite outgrowth and excitability of in vitro neuronal network. Furthermore, FA restored ABR threshold shifts and DPOAE in gentamicin-induced neuronal hearing loss mouse model in vivo. Our data, for the first time, support potential therapeutic efficacy of FA in promoting survival and differentiation of NSCs to prevent gentamicin-induced neuronal hearing loss.

Abstract: Summary
Notch signaling plays a role in specifying a cardiac fate but the downstream effectors remain unknown. In this study we implicate the Notch downstream effector HES5 in cardiogenesis. We show transient Hes5 expression in early mesoderm of gastrulating embryos and demonstrate, by loss and gain-of-function experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells, that HES5 favors cardiac over primitive erythroid fate. Hes5 overexpression promotes upregulation of the cardiac gene Isl1, while the hematopoietic regulator Scl is downregulated. Moreover, whereas a pulse of Hes5 instructs cardiac commitment, sustained expression after lineage specification impairs progression of differentiation to contracting cardiomyocytes. These findings establish a role for HES5 in cardiogenesis and provide insights into the early cardiac molecular network.

Abstract: Angiogenesis is now well known for being involved in tumor progression, aggressiveness, emergence of metastases, and also resistance to cancer therapies. In this study, to better mimic tumor angiogenesis encountered in vivo, we used 3D culture of osteosarcoma cells (MG-63) that we deposited on 2D endothelial cells (HUVEC) grown in monolayer. We report that endothelial cells combined with tumor cells were able to form a well-organized network, and that tubule-like structures corresponding to new vessels infiltrate tumor spheroids. These vessels presented a lumen and expressed specific markers as CD31 and collagen IV. The combination of 2D endothelial cells and 3D microtissues of tumor cells also increased expression of angiogenic factors as VEGF, CXCR4 and ICAM1. The cell environment is the key point to develop tumor vascularization in vitro and to be closer to tumor encountered in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The H1 haplotype of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) locus is genetically associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and affects gene expression and splicing. However, the functional impact on neurons of such expression differences has yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we employ extended maturation phases during differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into mature dopaminergic neuronal cultures to obtain cultures expressing all six adult tau protein isoforms. After 6 months of maturation, levels of exon 3+ and exon 10+ transcripts approach those of adult brain. Mature dopaminergic neuronal cultures display haplotype differences in expression, with H1 expressing 22% higher levels of MAPT transcripts than H2 and H2 expressing 2-fold greater exon 3+ transcripts than H1. Furthermore, knocking down adult tau protein variants alters axonal transport velocities in mature iPSC-derived dopaminergic neuronal cultures. This work links haplotype-specific MAPT expression with a biologically functional outcome relevant for PD.

Abstract: Targeting cyclin D-CDK4/6 kinase complexes has recently been shown to increase the survival of breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor positive breast tumors. Based on these outcomes, CDK4/6 inhibitors are currently being tested, alone o in combination with other drugs, in the treatment of other malignancies characterized by hyper-activation of cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes. Nonetheless, a better understanding of the cellular processes that are implemented in response to CDK4/6 inhibition is necessary to expand the therapeutic window and confront the development of drug resistance. Herein, we show that, similar to mammary cells, gastric cancer cells are sensitive to the CDK4/6 inhibitor Palbociclib. Inhibition of CDK4/6 in gastric cancer cells leads to the implementation of cellular senescence. However, whether or not this response is accompanied by induction of autophagy seems to depend on both the pRB and p53 status. In cells retaining expression of both tumor suppressive proteins (AGS gastric cancer cells), exposure to Palbociclib induces senescence and autophagy. However, the simultaneous blockade of CDK4/6 and autophagy in these cells exacerbates the senescence phenotype, an indication that autophagy in these experimental settings represents an adaptive mechanism that promotes cell survival rather than being an effector mechanism of senescence. Interestingly, knocking down p53 resulted in senescence reduction and autophagy blockade, the latter apparently involving a disruption of the degradation of autophagosome cargo.

Abstract: Over-activation of beta-catenin/TCF signaling has been frequently observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Better understanding the molecular mechanism for the aberrant activation of beta-catenin/TCF signaling would provide novel insights into the treatment of this malignancy. In this study, we have shown that the expression of PKMYT1 was up-regulated in HCC. PKMYT1 positively regulated the growth, migration, colony formation, metastasis and epithelia mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells. Mechanically, PKMTY1 activated the beta-catenin/TCF signaling by binding and inactivating GSK3beta. Taken together, our study demonstrated the oncogenic activity of PKMYT1 in the progression of HCC and suggested that PKMYT1 might be a therapeutic target.

Abstract: Although advances in chemotherapy have improved the prognosis for osteosarcoma, some patients do not respond sufficiently to treatment. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is expressed at high levels in cancer cells and attenuates the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer agents, resulting in a poorer prognosis. This study investigated whether small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of Hsp70 expression in an osteosarcoma cell line would enhance sensitivity to cisplatin. The expression of Hsp70 with cisplatin treatment was observed by using Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Changes in the IC50 of cisplatin when Hsp70 was inhibited by siRNA were evaluated. Cisplatin’s effectiveness in inducing apoptosis was assessed by assay of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), caspase-3 activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Up-regulation of Hsp70 expression was dependent on the concentration of cisplatin. Inhibition of Hsp70 expression significantly reduced the IC50 of cisplatin. When cisplatin was added to osteosarcoma cells with Hsp70 expression inhibited, a significant increase in apoptosis was demonstrated in TUNEL, caspase-3, and mitochondrial membrane potential assays. Inhibition of Hsp70 expression induced apoptosis in cultured osteosarcoma cells, indicating that Hsp70 inhibition enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin. Inhibition of Hsp70 expression may provide a new adjuvant therapy for osteosarcoma.

Abstract: De-differentiation comprises a major drawback for the use of autologous chondrocytes in cartilage repair. Here, we investigate the role of RhoA and canonical Wnt signaling in chondrocyte phenotype. Chondrocyte de-differentiation is accompanied by an upregulation and nuclear localization of RhoA. Effectors of canonical Wnt signaling including β-catenin and YAP/TAZ are upregulated in de-differentiating chondrocytes in a Rho-dependent manner. Inhibition of Rho activation with C3 transferase inhibits nuclear localization of RhoA, induces expression of chondrogenic markers on 2D and enhances the chondrogenic effect of 3D culturing. Upregulation of chondrogenic markers by Rho inhibition is accompanied by loss of canonical Wnt signaling markers in 3D or on 2D whereas treatment of chondrocytes with Wnt-3a abrogates this effect. However, induction of canonical Wnt signaling inhibits chondrogenic markers on 2D but enhances chondrogenic re-differentiation on 2D with C3 transferase or in 3D. These data provide insights on the context-dependent role of RhoA and Wnt signaling in de-differentiation and on mechanisms to induce chondrogenic markers for therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: The novel class of dual-family immunophilins (henceforth abbreviated as DFI) represents naturally occurring chimera of classical FK506-binding protein (FKBP) and cyclophilin (CYN), connected by a flexible linker that may include a three-unit tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat. Here, I report a comprehensive analysis of all current DFI sequences and their host organisms. DFIs are of two kinds: CFBP (cyclosporin- and FK506-binding protein) and FCBP (FK506- and cyclosporin-binding protein), found in eukaryotes. The CFBP type occurs in select bacteria that are mostly extremophiles, such as psychrophilic, thermophilic, halophilic, and sulfur-reducing. Essentially all DFI organisms are unicellular. I suggest that DFIs are specialized bifunctional chaperones that use their flexible interdomain linker to associate with large polypeptides or multisubunit megacomplexes to promote simultaneous folding or renaturation of two clients in proximity, essential in stressful and denaturing environments. Analysis of sequence homology and predicted 3D structures of the FKBP and CYN domains as well as the TPR linkers upheld the modular nature of the DFIs and revealed the uniqueness of their TPR domain. The CFBP and FCBP genes appear to have evolved in parallel pathways with no obvious single common ancestor. The occurrence of both types of DFI in multiple unrelated phylogenetic clades supported their selection in metabolic and environmental niche roles rather than a traditional taxonomic relationship. Nonetheless, organisms with these rare immunophilins may define an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) bound by the commonality of chaperone function.

Abstract: Summary
Several groups have reported the existence of a form of pluripotency that resembles that of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), i.e., a naive state, in human pluripotent stem cells; however, the characteristics vary between reports. The nuclear receptor ESRRB is expressed in mESCs and plays a significant role in their self-renewal, but its expression has not been observed in most naive-like human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In this study, we modified several methods for converting hiPSCs into a naive state through the transgenic expression of several reprogramming factors. The resulting cells express the components of the core transcriptional network of mESCs, including ESRRB, at high levels, which suggests the existence of naive-state hiPSCs that are similar to mESCs. We also demonstrate that these cells differentiate more readily into neural cells than do conventional hiPSCs. These features may be beneficial for their use in disease modeling and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Dgcr8 knockout cells provide a great means to understand the function of microRNAs (miRNAs) in vitro and in vivo. Current strategies to study miRNA function in Dgcr8 knockout cells depend on transient transfection of chemically synthesized miRNA mimics, which is costly and not suitable for long-term study and genetic selection of miRNA function. Here, we developed a cost-effective DGCR8-independent stable miRNA expression (DISME) strategy based on a short hairpin RNA vector that can be precisely processed by DICER. Using DISME, we found that miR-294 promoted the formation of meso-endoderm lineages during embryonic stem cell differentiation. Furthermore, DISME allowed for a pooled screen of miRNA function and identified an miR-183–182 cluster of miRNAs promoting self-renewal and pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells. Altogether, our study demonstrates that DISME is a robust and cost-effective strategy that allows for long-term study and genetic selection of miRNA function in a Dgcr8 knockout background.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are regulated by pluripotency-related transcription factors in concert with chromatin regulators. To identify additional stem cell regulators, we screened a library of endogenously labeled fluorescent fusion proteins in mouse ESCs for fluorescence loss during differentiation. We identified SET, which displayed a rapid isoform shift during early differentiation from the predominant isoform in ESCs, SETα, to the primary isoform in differentiated cells, SETβ, through alternative promoters. SETα is selectively bound and regulated by pluripotency factors. SET depletion causes proliferation slowdown and perturbed neuronal differentiation in vitro and developmental arrest in vivo, and photobleaching methods demonstrate SET's role in maintaining a dynamic chromatin state in ESCs. This work identifies an important regulator of pluripotency and early differentiation, which is controlled by alternative promoter usage.

Abstract: Summary
Current donor cell-dependent strategies can only produce limited “made-to-order” therapeutic natural killer (NK) cells for limited patients. To provide unlimited “off-the-shelf” NK cells that serve many recipients, we designed and demonstrated a holistic manufacturing scheme to mass-produce NK cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Starting with a highly accessible human cell source, peripheral blood cells (PBCs), we derived a good manufacturing practice-compatible iPSC source, PBC-derived iPSCs (PBC-iPSCs) for this purpose. Through our original protocol that excludes CD34+ cell enrichment and spin embryoid body formation, high-purity functional and expandable NK cells were generated from PBC-iPSCs. Above all, most of these NK cells expressed no killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), which renders them unrestricted by recipients' human leukocyte antigen genotypes. Hence, we have established a practical “from blood cell to stem cells and back with less (less KIRs)” strategy to generate abundant “universal” NK cells from PBC-iPSCs for a wide range of patients.

Abstract: Summary
During liver development, hepatoblasts and liver non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) constitute the liver bud where they proliferate and differentiate. Accordingly, we reasoned that liver NPCs would support the maturation of hepatocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which usually exhibit limited functions. We found that the transforming growth factor β and Rho signaling pathways, respectively, regulated the proliferation and maturation of LSEC and HSC progenitors isolated from mouse fetal livers. Based on these results, we have established culture systems to generate LSECs and HSCs from hiPSCs. These hiPSC-derived NPCs exhibited distinctive phenotypes and promoted self-renewal of hiPSC-derived liver progenitor cells (LPCs) over the long term in the two-dimensional culture system without exogenous cytokines and hepatic maturation of hiPSC-derived LPCs. Thus, a functional human liver model can be constructed in vitro from the LPCs, LSECs, and HSCs derived from hiPSCs.

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive pulmonary vascular disease which is associated with pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) dysfunction and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells proliferation. Moreover, inflammation is contributing a critical role in EC dysfunction and remains elusive. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a master transcriptional regulator in various cardiovascular pathologies; but, NF-κB's role in EC dysfunction in unknown. Our previous study using cardiac and lung specific IκBα mutant mice (3M and IKBM) showed that PAH induced right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) was prevented in monocrotaline (MCT) treated 3M and IKBM mice, compared to the wild-type mice. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a new class of post-transcriptional regulators in vascular remodeling; but, NF-κB regulated miRNA modulation in EC dysfunction is unknown. Using miRNA array analysis, we identified miR-130a which is upregulated in MCT-induced PAH mouse model, as a possible candidate to study. We showed that overexpressing miR-130a in lung microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) promoted activation of α-smooth muscle actin, a critical component in endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in EC remodeling. In this study, we demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) was a target for miR-130a and miR-130a was regulated by NF-κB which controlled apoptosis and vascular genes in MVEC. The findings reveal that NF-κB-mediated miR-130a modulation is critical in lung vascular remodeling.

Abstract: In humans, ten genes encode small heat shock proteins with lens αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin representing two of the most prominent members. The canonical isoforms of αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin collaborate in the eye lens to prevent irreversible protein aggregation and preserve visual acuity. α-Crystallins form large polydisperse homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers and as part of the proteostasis system bind substrate proteins in non-native conformations, thereby stabilizing them. Here, we analyzed a previously uncharacterized, alternative splice variant (isoform 2) of human αA-crystallin with an exchanged N-terminal sequence. This variant shows the characteristic α-crystallin secondary structure, exists on its own predominantly in a monomer–dimer equilibrium, and displays only low chaperone activity. However, the variant is able to integrate into higher order oligomers of canonical αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin as well as their hetero-oligomer. The presence of the variant leads to the formation of new types of higher order hetero-oligomers with an overall decreased number of subunits and enhanced chaperone activity. Thus, alternative mRNA splicing of human αA-crystallin leads to an additional, formerly not characterized αA-crystallin species which is able to modulate the properties of the canonical ensemble of α-crystallin oligomers.

Abstract: Many studies have demonstrated that the inflamed mucosa of Crohn's disease (CD) patients presented a disturbed gut commensal community, and the shift in microbial composition and species variety is associated with disease severity. To establish a link between changes in the intestinal bacterial composition and the alteration of inflammation, we obtained fecal bacteria from CD patients and non-CD controls. The bacteria were then used to stimulate the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from one non-CD individual. We found that the frequency of IFN-γ- and IL-17-expressing CD4 T cells was significantly higher after stimulation with CD bacteria than with non-CD bacteria, while the frequency of IL-4- and IL-10-expressing CD4 T cells was significantly decreased after stimulation with CD bacteria. A similar trend was observed in the level of cytokine expression and transcription expression. However, this difference was not clear-cut, as overlapping regions were observed between the two groups. With longer stimulation using CD bacteria, the skewing toward Th1/Th17 responses were further increased. This increase depended on the presence of monocytes/macrophages. Interestingly, we also found that B cells presented an inhibitory effect in CD bacteria-mediated skewing toward Th1/Th17 cells and promoted IL-10 secretion in CD bacteria-stimulated PBMCs. Together, our results demonstrated that CD bacteria could promote Th1/Th17 inflammation in a host factor-independent fashion.

Abstract: Here we evaluated the effects of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hREC) on mature human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. The hESC-RPE cells (Regea08/017, Regea08/023 or Regea11/013) and hREC (ACBRI 181) were co-cultured on opposite sides of transparent membranes for up to six weeks. Thereafter barrier function, small molecule permeability, localization of RPE and endothelial cell marker proteins, cellular fine structure, and growth factor secretion of were evaluated. After co-culture, the RPE specific CRALBP and endothelial cell specific von Willebrand factor were appropriately localized. In addition, the general morphology, pigmentation, and fine structure of hESC-RPE cells were unaffected. Co-culture increased the barrier function of hESC-RPE cells, detected both with TEER measurements and cumulative permeability of FD4 – although the differences varied among the cell lines. Co-culturing significantly altered VEGF and PEDF secretion, but again the differences were cell line specific. The results of this study showed that co-culture with hREC affects hESC-RPE functionality. In addition, co-culture revealed drastic cell line specific differences, most notably in growth factor secretion. This model has the potential to be used as an in vitro outer blood-retinal barrier model for drug permeability testing.

Abstract: It was previously demonstrated that differentiation of some established breast epithelial cell lines requires confluence and stimulation with hydrocortisone, insulin and prolactin inducers. We and others previously demonstrated that E-cadherin engagement, which is favored under conditions of confluence, increases the levels and activity of the Rac small GTPase. To investigate the functional relationship between the transforming ability of Rac and its role as an integral component of the differentiative E-cadherin signaling pathway, we introduced a mutationally activated form of Rac, RacV12, into the mouse breast epithelium-derived cell line, HC11. Our results demonstrate that the strength of the Rac signal is key for the outcome of the differentiation process; cRac1 is critically required for differentiation, and at low levels, mutationally activated RacV12 is able to increase differentiation, presumably reinforcing the E-cadherin/Rac differentiative signal. However, high RacV12 expression blocked differentiation concomitant with E-cadherin downregulation, while inducing neoplastic transformation. Therefore, the intensity of the Rac signal is a central determinant in the balance between cell proliferation vs differentiation, two fundamentally opposed processes, a finding which could also have important therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common tachyarrhythmia which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. AF usually progresses from a self-terminating paroxysmal to persistent disease. It has been recognized that AF progression is driven by structural remodeling of cardiomyocytes, which results in electrical and contractile dysfunction of the atria. We recently showed that structural remodeling is rooted in derailment of proteostasis, i.e., homeostasis of protein production, function, and degradation. Since heat shock proteins (HSPs) play an important role in maintaining a healthy proteostasis, the role of HSPs was investigated in AF. It was found that especially small heat shock protein (HSPB) levels get exhausted in atrial tissue of patients with persistent AF and that genetic or pharmacological induction of HSPB protects against cardiomyocyte remodeling in experimental models for AF. In this review, we provide an overview of HSPBs as a potential therapeutic target for normalizing proteostasis and suppressing the substrates for AF progression in experimental and clinical AF and discuss HSP activators as a promising therapy to prevent AF onset and progression.

Abstract: Summary
Ground-state pluripotency is a cell state in which pluripotency is established and maintained through efficient repression of endogenous differentiation pathways. Self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are influenced by ESC-associated microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the “miRNome” of ESCs cultured under conditions favoring ground-state pluripotency. We found that ground-state ESCs express a distinct set of miRNAs compared with ESCs grown in serum. Interestingly, most “ground-state miRNAs” are encoded by an imprinted region on chromosome 12 within the Dlk1-Dio3 locus. Functional analysis revealed that ground-state miRNAs embedded in the Dlk1-Dio3 locus (miR-541-5p, miR-410-3p, and miR-381-3p) promoted pluripotency via inhibition of multi-lineage differentiation and stimulation of self-renewal. Overall, our results demonstrate that ground-state pluripotency is associated with a unique miRNA signature, which supports ground-state self-renewal by suppressing differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Small post-translationally modified peptide hormones mediate crucial developmental and regulatory processes in plants. CLAVATA/ENDOSPERM-SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) genes are found throughout the plant kingdom and encode for 12–13 amino acid peptides that must often undergo post-translational proline hydroxylation and glycosylation with O-β1,2-triarabinose moieties before they become functional. Apart from a few recent examples, a detailed understanding of the structure and function of most CLE hormones is yet to be uncovered. This is mainly owing to difficulties in isolating mature homogeneously modified CLE peptides from natural plant sources. In this study, we describe the efficient synthesis of a synthetic Araf3Hyp glycosylamino acid building block that was used to access a hitherto uninvestigated CLE hormone from soybean called GmCLE40a. Through the development and implementation of a novel in vivo root growth assay, we show that the synthetic triarabinosylated glycopeptide suppresses primary root growth in this important crop species.

Abstract: Proviral insertion in murine (PIM) lymphoma proteins are mainly regulated by the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway, which can be activated by members of the Interleukin-6 (IL-6) family, including Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF). Aim of the study was to compare PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3 expression and potential cellular functions in human first and third trimester trophoblast cells, the immortalized first trimester extravillous trophoblast cell line HTR8/SVneo and the choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3. Expression was analyzed by qPCR and immunochemical staining. Functions were evaluated by PIM inhibition followed by analysis of kinetics of cell viability as assessed by MTS assay, proliferation by BrdU assay, and apoptosis by Western blotting for BAD, BCL-XL, (cleaved) PARP, CASP3 and c-MYC. Apoptosis and necrosis were tested by flow cytometry (annexin V/propidium iodide staining). All analyzed PIM kinases are expressed in primary trophoblast cells and both cell lines and are regulated upon stimulation with LIF. Inhibition of PIM kinases significantly reduces viability and proliferation and induces apoptosis. Simultaneously, phosphorylation of c-MYC was reduced. These results demonstrate the involvement of PIM kinases in LIF-induced regulation in different trophoblastic cell lines which may indicate similar functions in primary cells.

Abstract: Summary
A major challenge for clinical application of pluripotent stem cell therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) is large-scale manufacturing and cryopreservation of neurons that can be efficiently prepared with minimal manipulation. To address this obstacle, midbrain dopamine neurons were derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-mDA) and cryopreserved in large production lots for biochemical and transplantation studies. Cryopreserved, post-mitotic iPSC-mDA neurons retained high viability with gene, protein, and electrophysiological signatures consistent with midbrain floor-plate lineage. To test therapeutic efficacy, cryopreserved iPSC-mDA neurons were transplanted without subculturing into the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat and MPTP-lesioned non-human-primate models of PD. Grafted neurons retained midbrain lineage with extensive fiber innervation in both rodents and monkeys. Behavioral assessment in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats demonstrated significant reversal in functional deficits up to 6 months post transplantation with reinnervation of the host striatum and no aberrant growth, supporting the translational development of pluripotent cell-based therapies in PD.

Abstract: Summary
The essential micronutrient copper is tightly regulated in organisms, as environmental exposure or homeostasis defects can cause toxicity and neurodegenerative disease. The principal target(s) of copper toxicity have not been pinpointed, but one key effect is impaired supply of iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters to the essential protein Rli1 (ABCE1). Here, to find upstream FeS biosynthesis/delivery protein(s) responsible for this, we compared copper sensitivity of yeast-overexpressing candidate targets. Overexpression of the mitochondrial ferredoxin Yah1 produced copper hyper-resistance. 55Fe turnover assays revealed that FeS integrity of Yah1 was particularly vulnerable to copper among the test proteins. Furthermore, destabilization of the FeS domain of Yah1 produced copper hypersensitivity, and YAH1 overexpression rescued Rli1 dysfunction. This copper-resistance function was conserved in the human ferredoxin, Fdx2. The data indicate that the essential mitochondrial ferredoxin is an important copper target, determining a tipping point where plentiful copper supply becomes excessive. This knowledge could help in tackling copper-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Necroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that is linked to various human diseases. Distinct membrane-related, thus lipid-dependent, alterations take place during necroptosis. However, little is known about the roles of specific lipids in this process. We used an untargeted LC-MS-based approach to reveal that distinct lipid species are regulated at the molecular level during necroptosis. We found that ceramides and very long chain fatty acids accumulate during this process. Intrigued by the specificity of very long chain fatty acid accumulation, we focused on characterizing their involvement during necroptosis. Biochemical characterizations suggested that activated fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation could be responsible for these accumulations. We further showed that inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis and depletion of very long chain fatty acids prevented loss of plasma membrane integrity and cell death, strongly suggesting that very long chain fatty acids are functionally involved in necroptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) initiates viral entry by engaging host receptor sialylated glycans via its receptor-binding site (RBS). The amino acid sequence of the RBS naturally varies across avian and human influenza virus subtypes and is also evolvable. However, functional sequence diversity in the RBS has not been fully explored. Here, we performed a large-scale mutational analysis of the RBS of A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2) HAs. Many replication-competent mutants not yet observed in nature were identified, including some that could escape from an RBS-targeted broadly neutralizing antibody. This functional sequence diversity is made possible by pervasive epistasis in the RBS 220-loop and can be buffered by avidity in viral receptor binding. Overall, our study reveals that the HA RBS can accommodate a much greater range of sequence diversity than previously thought, which has significant implications for the complex evolutionary interrelationships between receptor specificity and immune escape.

Abstract: Summary
Astrocyte dysfunction and neuroinflammation are detrimental features in multiple pathologies of the CNS. Therefore, the development of methods that produce functional human astrocytes represents an advance in the study of neurological diseases. Here we report an efficient method for inflammation-responsive astrocyte generation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells. This protocol uses an intermediate glial progenitor stage and generates functional astrocytes that show levels of glutamate uptake and calcium activation comparable with those observed in human primary astrocytes. Stimulation of stem cell-derived astrocytes with interleukin-1β or tumor necrosis factor α elicits a strong and rapid pro-inflammatory response. RNA-sequencing transcriptome profiling confirmed that similar gene expression changes occurred in iPSC-derived and primary astrocytes upon stimulation with interleukin-1β. This protocol represents an important tool for modeling in-a-dish neurological diseases with an inflammatory component, allowing for the investigation of the role of diseased astrocytes in neuronal degeneration.

Abstract: Cardiotonic steroids (CTS) are compounds which bind to the Na,K-ATPase, leading to its inhibition and in some cases initiating signaling cascades. Long utilized as a treatment for congestive heart disease, CTS have more recently been observed to inhibit proliferation and cause apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. A synthetic derivative of the CTS digoxin, called 21-benzylidene digoxin (21-BD), activates the Na,K-ATPase rather than cause its inhibition, as its parent compound does. Here, the mechanism behind the unique effects of 21-BD are further explored. In HeLa cancer cells, low (5µM) and high (50µM) doses of 21-BD activated and inhibited the Na,K-ATPase, respectively, without altering the membrane expression of the Na,K-ATPase. While digoxin did not affect HeLa membrane cholesterol or phospholipid content, 50µM 21-BD increased both lipids via a mechanism reliant on an intact cell. Afterwards, the direct action of 21-BD was evaluated on erythrocyte membranes; however, no effect was observed. As CTS may generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can affect plasma membrane fluidity and therefore Na,K-ATPase activity, several markers involved in ROS generation were analyzed such as, lipid peroxidation (TBARS), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). GSH content and catalase activity were unaffected by digoxin or 21-BD. Surprisingly, TBARS and SOD activity was decreased with digoxin and with 50µM 21-BD. Thus, 21-BD and digoxin altered components involved in ROS generation and inhibition in a similar fashion. This study suggests alterations to the Na,K-ATPase and membrane lipids by 21-BD is not reliant on ROS generation.

Abstract: Gold nanoparticles have been investigated extensively for their molecular mechanisms of action and anticancer potential. We report a novel, tubulin-targeted antiproliferative mechanism of action of tryptone-stabilized gold nanoparticles (TsAuNPs). TsAuNPs, synthesized using HAuCl4·3H2O and tryptone and characterized by a variety of spectroscopic methods and transmission electron microscopy, were found to be inhibitory to viability of human pancreatic (PANC-1), cervical (HeLa), and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner, with highest efficacy against PANC-1 cells. The particles strongly inhibited the clonogenic propagation of PANC-1 cells. TsAuNPs-mediated inhibition of cell viability involved an unusual mode of cell cycle arrest (arrest at both G0/G1 phase and S-phase) followed by apoptosis. In vitro, TsAuNPs bound purified tubulin, competitively inhibited anilinonaphthalene sulfonate binding to tubulin, and suppressed tubulin assembly. In cells, tubulin-TsAuNPs interactions were manifested as a disrupted microtubule network, defective reassembly of cold-disassembled microtubules, and induction of tubulin acetylation. Our data indicate that TsAuNPs inhibit cell viability by inducing differential cell cycle arrest possibly through disrupted dynamicity of cellular microtubules.

Abstract: White Pekin duck is an important meat resource in the livestock industries. However, the temperature increase due to global warming has become a serious environmental factor in duck production, because of hyperthermia. Therefore, identifying the gene regulations and understanding the molecular mechanism for adaptation to the warmer environment will provide insightful information on the acclimation system of ducks. This study examined transcriptomic responses to heat stress treatments (3 and 6 h at 35 °C) and control (C, 25 °C) using RNA-sequencing analysis of genes from the breast muscle tissue. Based on three distinct differentially expressed gene (DEG) sets (3H/C, 6H/C, and 6H/3H), the expression patterns of significant DEGs (absolute log2 > 1.0 and false discovery rate < 0.05) were clustered into three responsive gene groups divided into upregulated and downregulated genes. Next, we analyzed the clusters that showed relatively higher expression levels in 3H/C and lower levels in 6H/C with much lower or opposite levels in 6H/3H; we referred to these clusters as the adaptable responsive gene group. These genes were significantly enriched in the ErbB signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and type II diabetes mellitus in the KEGG pathways (P < 0.01). From the functional enrichment analysis and significantly regulated genes observed in the enriched pathways, we think that the adaptable responsive genes are responsible for the acclimation mechanism of ducks and suggest that the regulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase genes including PIK3R6, PIK3R5, and PIK3C2B has an important relationship with the mechanisms of adaptation to heat stress in ducks.

Abstract: Extracellular cystine, the oxidized form of cysteine (Cys), is taken up by cells via the cystine transporter xCT. xCT is not expressed in the liver but is induced in primary hepatocytes under conventional cultured conditions. However, compared to wild-type hepatocytes those from the xCT-knockout mouse showed no evidence of an abnormality and the levels of both Cys and glutathione (GSH) remained unchanged. The levels of ophthalmic acid (OPT), which is produced as an alternative compound by the GSH-synthesizing pathway, became increased during the culturing of hepatocytes. It therefore appears that, in primary hepatocytes, Cys is provided by systems other than xCT, most likely via the transsulfuration pathway, but the levels that are produced are not sufficient. We also employed mouse hepatoma-derived Hepa1-6 cells, which constitutively express xCT. When Hepa 1-6 cells were cultivated in Cys-free media, the levels of intracellular Cys and GSH were decreased, compared to cells cultured in conventional media, leading to cell death accompanied by an increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation products with characteristics similar to ferroptosis. While OPT levels were increased by only to a limited extent in Hepa 1-6 cells, primary hepatocytes cultured in Cys- and Met-free media showed a marked elevation in OPT, reaching levels nearly equivalent to the GSH levels when the cells were cultured in conventional media. Thus, OPT may become a marker for Cys insufficiency and might be used to predict pathological conditions of cells with elevated oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Acquired or congenital disruption in enteric nervous system (ENS) development or function can lead to significant mechanical dysmotility. ENS restoration through cellular transplantation may provide a cure for enteric neuropathies. We have previously generated human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived tissue-engineered small intestine (TESI) from human intestinal organoids (HIOs). However, HIO-TESI fails to develop an ENS. The purpose of our study is to restore ENS components derived exclusively from hPSCs in HIO-TESI. hPSC-derived enteric neural crest cell (ENCC) supplementation of HIO-TESI establishes submucosal and myenteric ganglia, repopulates various subclasses of neurons, and restores neuroepithelial connections and neuron-dependent contractility and relaxation in ENCC-HIO-TESI. RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed genes involved in neurogenesis, gliogenesis, gastrointestinal tract development, and differentiated epithelial cell types when ENS elements are restored during in vivo development of HIO-TESI. Our findings validate an effective approach to restoring hPSC-derived ENS components in HIO-TESI and may implicate their potential for the treatment of enteric neuropathies.

Abstract: Y-box binding protein-1 (YBX1) is a multifunctional protein and often acts as an indicator of poor prognosis in cancers. Increasing evidence has shown that the levels of YBX1 protein were closely associated with multidrug resistance, relapse, metastasis and poor prognosis in cancers. However, its role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) metastasis remains unknown. In our study, we discovered that the expression of YBX1 was increased in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tissues. YBX1 protein levels positively correlated with T stage and metastasis of NPC patients. Moreover, expression of YBX1 was negatively correlated with membrane E-cadherin levels and positively correlated with Vimentin expression. In vitro, the expression of YBX1 was closely related to the invasive and migratory ability of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Knockdown of YBX1 inhibited migration and invasion in 5–8F cells, and over-expression of YBX1 promoted CNE1 cells migration and invasion. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) treatment led to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CNE1 cells accompanied by elevated YBX1 expression. On the contrary, knockdown of YBX1 partially inhibited the TGF-β1-induced CNE1 cell migration, together with changes of EMT-associated markers. Our study revealed that TGF-β1/YBX1 signaling might be one of novel mechanisms mediating EMT in NPC, providing a new target for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a molecular chaperone that plays an important role in cellular proteostasis. Hsp70s are also implicated in the survival and pathogenicity of malaria parasites. The main agent of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, expresses six Hsp70s. Of these, two (PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp70-z) localize to the parasite cytosol. Previously conducted gene knockout studies suggested that PfHsp70-z is essential, and it has been demonstrated that small-molecule inhibitors targeting PfHsp70-1 cause parasite death. For this reason, both PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp70-z are potential antimalarial targets. Two cyclic lipopeptides, colistin and polymyxin B (PMB), have been shown to bind another heat shock protein, Hsp90, inhibiting its chaperone function. In the current study, we investigated the effect of PMB on the structure–function features of PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp70-z. Using surface plasmon resonance analysis, we observed that PMB directly interacts with both PfHsp70-1 and PfHsp70-z. In addition, using circular dichroism spectrometric analysis combined with tryptophan fluorescence measurements, we observed that PMB modulated the secondary and tertiary structures of Hsp70. Furthermore, PMB inhibited the basal ATPase activity and chaperone function of the two Hsp70s. Our findings suggest that PMB associates with Hsp70 to inhibit its function. In light of the central role of Hsp70 in cellular proteostasis and its essential role in the development of malaria parasites in particular, our findings expand the library of small-molecule inhibitors that target this medically important class of molecular chaperones.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils represent the main infected cell population in the lungs of active tuberculosis patients. Efficient removal of infected and dying neutrophils is required to protect the surrounding tissue from bioactive neutrophil molecules and subsequent pathological sequelae. While the removal of apoptotic M. tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected cells, or efferocytosis, is considered beneficial for host defense, little is known about Mtb-infected necrotic neutrophils. We found that Mtb induces necrosis of human neutrophils in an ESX-1-dependent manner, and neutrophil-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) drive this necrosis. Neutrophil necrosis was required for Mtb growth after uptake of infected neutrophils by human macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of ROS production could prevent necrosis and restore the capability of macrophages to control Mtb growth, thereby identifying a potential host-directed therapy target. Taken together, necrosis represents the starting point for a vicious cycle including the uptake of infected necrotic cells by other phagocytes, Mtb growth therein, and sustained infection.

Abstract: Summary
OCT4 is required to maintain the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs); yet, overdose-expression of OCT4 induces ESC differentiation toward primitive endoderm. The molecular mechanism underlying this differentiation switch is not fully understood. Here, we found that substitution of threonine343 by alanine (T343A), but not aspartic acid (T343D), caused a significant loss of OCT4-phosphorylation signal in ESCs. Loss of such OCT4-phosphorylation compromises its interaction with SOX2 but promotes interaction with SOX17. We therefore propose that threonine343-based OCT4-phosphorylation is crucial for the maintenance of ESC pluripotency. This OCT4-phosphorylation-based mechanism may provide insight into the regulation of lineage specification during early embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
There is increasing interest in developing cationic host defense peptides (HDPs) and their synthetic derivatives as antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and anti-biofilm agents. These activities are often evaluated without considering biologically relevant concentrations of salts or serum; furthermore certain HDPs have been shown to aggregate in vitro. Here we examined the effect of aggregation on the immunomodulatory activity of a synthetic innate defense regulator peptide, 1018 (VRLIVAVRIWRR-NH2). A variety of salts and solutes were screened to determine their influence on 1018 aggregation, revealing that this peptide “salts out” of solution in an anion-specific and concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory activity of 1018 was found to be inhibited under aggregation-promoting conditions. A series of 1018 derivatives were synthesized with the goal of disrupting this self-assembly process. Indeed, some derivatives exhibited reduced aggregation while maintaining certain immunomodulatory functions, demonstrating that it is possible to engineer optimized synthetic HDPs to avoid unwanted peptide aggregation.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogenesis is the process by which spermatozoa are generated from spermatogonia. This cell population is heterogeneous, with self-renewing spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and progenitor spermatogonia that will continue on a path of differentiation. Only SSCs have the ability to regenerate and sustain spermatogenesis. This makes the testis a good model to investigate stem cell biology. The Farnesoid X Receptor alpha (FXRα) was recently shown to be expressed in the testis. However, its global impact on germ cell homeostasis has not yet been studied. Here, using a phenotyping approach in Fxrα−/− mice, we describe unexpected roles of FXRα on germ cell physiology independent of its effects on somatic cells. FXRα helps establish and maintain an undifferentiated germ cell pool and in turn influences male fertility. FXRα regulates the expression of several pluripotency factors. Among these, in vitro approaches show that FXRα controls the expression of the pluripotency marker Lin28 in the germ cells.

Abstract: Summary
Many intracellular pathogens exploit host secretory trafficking to support their intracellular cycle, but knowledge of these pathogenic processes is limited. The bacterium Brucella abortus uses a type IV secretion system (VirB T4SS) to generate a replication-permissive Brucella-containing vacuole (rBCV) derived from the host ER, a process that requires host early secretory trafficking. Here we show that the VirB T4SS effector BspB contributes to rBCV biogenesis and Brucella replication by interacting with the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) tethering complex, a major coordinator of Golgi vesicular trafficking, thus remodeling Golgi membrane traffic and redirecting Golgi-derived vesicles to the BCV. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that Brucella modulates COG-dependent trafficking via delivery of a T4SS effector to promote rBCV biogenesis and intracellular proliferation, providing mechanistic insight into how bacterial exploitation of host secretory functions promotes pathogenesis.

Abstract: Senescent cells have lost their capacity for proliferation and manifest as irreversibly in cell cycle arrest. Many membrane receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), initiate a variety of intracellular signaling cascades modulating cell division and potentially play roles in triggering cellular senescence response. GPCR kinases (GRKs) belong to a family of serine/threonine kinases. Although their role in homologous desensitization of activated GPCRs is well established, the involvement of the kinases in cell proliferation is still largely unknown. In this study, we isolated GRK4-GFP expressing HEK293 cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and found that the ectopic expression of GRK4 halted cell proliferation. Cells expressing GRK4 (GRK4(+)) demonstrated cell cycle G1/G0 phase arrest, accompanied with significant increase of senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) activity. Expression profiling analysis of 78 senescence-related genes by qRT-PCR showed a total of 17 genes significantly changed in GRK4(+) cells (≥ 2 fold, p < 0.05). Among these, 9 genes — AKT1, p16INK4, p27KIP1, p19INK4, IGFBP3, MAPK14, PLAU, THBS1, TP73 — were up-regulated, while 8 genes, Cyclin A2, Cyclin D1, CDK2, CDK6, ETS1, NBN, RB1, SIRT1, were down-regulated. The increase in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16, p27) and p38 MAPK proteins (MAPK14) was validated by immunoblotting. Neither p53 nor p21Waf1/Cip1 protein was detectable, suggesting no p53 activation in the HEK293 cells. These results unveil a novel function of GRK4 on triggering a p53-independent cellular senescence, which involves an intricate signaling network.

Abstract: Phytochemicals extracted from flowers, roots and bark, leaves, and other plant sources have been used extensively throughout human history with varying levels of efficacy in prevention and treatment of disease. Recently, advanced methods for characterization and clinical use of these materials have allowed modern understanding of their properties to be used as immunomodulatory agents that act by enhancement of endogenous cytoprotective mechanisms, avoiding interference with normal physiologic signaling and highly effective medical treatment with minimal adverse side effects. Simple methods have been identified for improving their biological effects, such as thermal conditioning by heating or freezing—prominent example being heat treatment of lycopene and tetrahydrocannabinol. The present investigation shows improvement of the ability of heat to augment splenocyte proliferation, natural killer (NK) cell activities, and antioxidant capacity of the flavonoid luteolin-7-O-β-glucoside (L7G) in comparison with the native (non heat-treated) molecule, while further demonstrating that both the native and the heat-treated variants exhibit comparable antioxidant properties, as evidenced by their effects in macrophages by inhibition of nitric oxide production and lysosomal enzyme activity in experiments that strengthen lysosomal membrane integrity. Outcomes of these studies suggest that heat-treated L7G shows promise for use in immunotherapy, including anti-cancer regimens, as shown by its improvement of NK cell cytotoxicity.

Abstract: Akt activation in macrophages enhances lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses through upregulation of the NF-κB signal pathway. Akt phosphorylation via microRNA (miR) caused the downregulation of Akt1. Here, we evaluated the role of miR-29a in LPS-triggered inflammatory responses. LPS stimulation of primary macrophages and RAW264.7 cells gradually increased the levels of miR-29a and was dependent on the LPS concentration. Overexpression of miR-29a in macrophages enhanced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-6, but not TNF-α. Conversely, knockdown of miR-29a diminished cytokine expression. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that Akt1 was a potential target of miR-29a through its interaction with the CDS region of Akt1. The miR-29a also enhanced LPS-induced NF-κB signaling through increased NF-κB transcriptional activity and phosphorylation of p65, and through binding to Akt1. Moreover, Akt1 silencing promoted the LPS-induced expression of IL-1β and IL-6, and upregulated the NF-κB pathway. Taken together, our results suggested that miR-29a participates in the regulation of inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated macrophages by promoting NF-κB activation through targeting Akt1.

Abstract: Summary
Precisely defining how viral mutations affect HIV’s sensitivity to antibodies is vital to develop and evaluate vaccines and antibody immunotherapeutics. Despite great effort, a full map of escape mutants has not been delineated for an anti-HIV antibody. We describe a massively parallel experimental approach to quantify how all single amino acid mutations to HIV Envelope (Env) affect neutralizing antibody sensitivity in the context of replication-competent virus. We apply this approach to PGT151, a broadly neutralizing antibody recognizing a combination of Env residues and glycans. We confirm sites previously defined by structural and functional studies and reveal additional sites of escape, such as positively charged mutations in the antibody-Env interface. Evaluating the effect of each amino acid at each site lends insight into biochemical mechanisms of escape throughout the epitope, highlighting roles for charge-charge repulsions. Thus, comprehensively mapping HIV antibody escape gives a quantitative, mutation-level view of Env evasion of neutralization.

Abstract: Pluripotent stem cell activity is essential to maintain regeneration and homeostasis in the Drosophila midgut following environmental challenges. Although multiple pathways have been implicated in epithelial renewal, the underlying regulatory mechanisms and correlations between relevant genes and pathways remain elusive. In this study, we show that the zinc finger protein CG12744 plays an important role in the differentiation and regeneration of epithelial cells in response to oral infection with Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15. Knocking down CG12744 in enteroblasts decreased the post-infection proportion of enteroblasts and enterocytes and increased the post-infection number of enteroendocrine cells. In addition, in precursors, CG12744 affected the Osa, jun-N-terminal kinase and bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathways to control enterocyte differentiation. Finally, CG12744 maintained epithelial architecture and cell fate in enterocytes following an acute infectious challenge.

Abstract: Gastric cancer tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (GC-MSCs) are important resident stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and have been shown to play a key role in gastric cancer progression. Whether GC-MSCs exert a tumor-promoting function by affecting anti-tumor immunity is still unclear. In this study, we used GC-MSC conditioned medium (GC-MSC-CM) to pretreat peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors. We found that GC-MSC-CM pretreatment markedly reversed the inhibitory effect of PBMCs on gastric cancer growth in vivo, but did not affect functions of PBMCs on gastric cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis in vitro. PBMCs pretreated with GC-MSC-CM significantly promoted gastric cancer migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro and liver metastases in vivo. Flow cytometry analysis showed that GC-MSC-CM pretreatment increased the proportion of Treg cells and reduced that of Th17 cells in PBMCs. CFSE labeling and naïve CD4+ T cells differentiation analysis revealed that GC-MSC-CM disrupted the Treg/Th17 balance in PBMCs by suppressing Th17 cell proliferation and inducing differentiation of Treg cells. Overall, our collective results indicate that GC-MSCs impair the anti-tumor immune response of PBMCs through disruption of Treg/Th17 balance, thus providing new evidence that gastric cancer tissue-derived MSCs contribute to the immunosuppressive TME.

Abstract: Syphilis is a chronic disease caused by Treponema pallidum and the pathogenesis is still unclear. T. pallidum infection induced inflammatory responses are involved in the immunopathological damage in skin and other tissues. Flagellin, the monomeric subunit of bacterial flagella, is a classic pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that interacts to TLR5 and induces inflammatory responses. Keratinocytes, as immune sentinels recognize the PAMPs via TLRs, play an important role in skin innate immune response. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expressed by keratinocytes are involved in skin inflammatory responses and promoting pathogens invasion. In this study, we demonstrate that FlaB1, FlaB2 and FlaB3, the flagellins of T. pallidum, induced MMP-9 and MMP-13 production in human immortalized keratinocytes cell line HaCaT. Silencing of TLR5, but not TLR2 and TLR4 attenuated MMP-9 and MMP-13 expressions induced by T. pallidum flagellins. MMP-9 and MMP-13 expressions were also be abrogated by transfection with a dominant negative (DN) plasmid of MyD88. We also found that treatment of HaCaT cells with FlaB1, FlaB2 and FlaB3 activate the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Inhibited of ERK, JNK, p38 and NF-κB suppressed MMP-9 expression induced by the FlaB1. MMP-13 expression was found to be suppressed by pretreatment with inhibitors of ERK, JNK and NF-κB, but not p38. These findings demonstrate that T. pallidum flagellins (FlaB1, FlaB2 or FlaB3) can stimulate MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression through TLR5 and MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways in human epidermal keratinocytes, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of T. pallidum infection.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke leads to cellular dysfunction, cell death, and devastating clinical outcomes. The cells of the brain react to such a cellular stress by a stress response with an upregulation of heat shock proteins resulting in activation of endogenous neuroprotective capacities. Several members of the family of small heat shock proteins (HspBs) have been shown to be neuroprotective. However, yet no systematic study examined all HspBs during cerebral ischemia. Here, we performed a comprehensive comparative study comprising all HspBs in an animal model of stroke, i.e., 1 h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 23 h of reperfusion. On the mRNA level out of the 11 HspBs investigated, HspB1/Hsp25, HspB3, HspB4/αA-crystallin, HspB5/αB-crystallin, HspB7/cvHsp, and HspB8/Hsp22 were significantly upregulated in the peri-infarct region of the cerebral cortex of infarcted hemispheres. HspB1 and HspB5 reached the highest mRNA levels and were also upregulated at the protein level, suggesting that these HspBs might be functionally most relevant. Interestingly, in the infarcted cortex, both HspB1 and HspB5 were mainly allocated to neurons and to a lesser extent to glial cells. Additionally, both proteins were found to be phosphorylated in response to ischemia. Our data suggest that among all HspBs, HspB1 and HspB5 might be most important in the neuronal stress response to ischemia/reperfusion injury in the brain and might be involved in neuroprotection.

Abstract: Summary
Naive mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can develop multiple fates, but the cellular and molecular processes that enable lineage competence are poorly characterized. Here, we investigated progression from the ESC ground state in defined culture. We utilized downregulation of Rex1::GFPd2 to track the loss of ESC identity. We found that cells that have newly downregulated this reporter have acquired capacity for germline induction. They can also be efficiently specified for different somatic lineages, responding more rapidly than naive cells to inductive cues. Inhibition of autocrine NODAL signaling did not alter kinetics of exit from the ESC state but compromised both germline and somatic lineage specification. Transient inhibition prior to loss of ESC identity was sufficient for this effect. Genetic ablation of Nodal reduced viability during early differentiation, consistent with defective lineage specification. These results suggest that NODAL promotes acquisition of multi-lineage competence in cells departing naive pluripotency.

Abstract: Chemical fixation is nearly indispensable in the biological sciences, especially in circumstances where cryo-fixation is not applicable. While universally employed for the preservation of cell organization, chemical fixatives often introduce artifacts that can confound identification of true structures. Since biological research is increasingly probing ever-finer details of the cellular architecture, it is critical to understand the nanoscale transformation of the cellular organization due to fixation both systematically and quantitatively. In this work, we employed Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) Microscopy, a nanoscale sensitive and label-free live cell spectroscopic-imaging technique, to analyze the effects of the fixation process through three commonly used fixation protocols for cells in vitro. In each method investigated, we detected dramatic difference in both nuclear and cytoplasmic nanoarchitecture between live and fixed states. But significantly, despite the alterations in cellular nanoscale organizations after chemical fixation, the population differences in chromatin structure (e.g. induced by a specific chemotherapeutic agent) remains. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the nanoscale cellular arrangement observed in fixed cells was fundamentally divorced from that in live cells, thus the quantitative analysis is only meaningful on the population level. This finding highlights the importance of live cell imaging techniques with nanoscale sensitivity or cryo-fixation in the interrogation of cellular structure, to complement more traditional chemical fixation methods.

Abstract: Stem cell therapy is considered a promising approach in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seem to be the most effective in ALS animal models. The umbilical cord (UC) is a source of highly proliferating fetal MSCs, more easily collectable than other MSCs. Recently we demonstrated that human (h) UC-MSCs, double labeled with fluorescent nanoparticles and Hoechst-33258 and transplanted intracerebroventricularly (ICV) into SOD1G93A transgenic mice, partially migrated into the spinal cord after a single injection. This prompted us to assess the effect of repeated ICV injections of hUC-MSCs on disease progression in SOD1G93A mice. Although no transplanted cells migrated to the spinal cord, a partial but significant protection of motor neurons (MNs) was found in the lumbar spinal cord of hUC-MSCs-treated SOD1G93A mice, accompanied by a shift from a pro-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-1β) to anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) and neuroprotective (IGF-1) environment in the lumbar spinal cord, probably linked to the activation of p-Akt survival pathway in both motor neurons and reactive astrocytes. However, this treatment neither prevented the muscle denervation nor delayed the disease progression of mice, emphasizing the growing evidence that protecting the motor neuron perikarya is not sufficient to delay the ALS progression.

Abstract: Background
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered to be important for cancer invasion and metastasis. Tumour hypoxia, in addition to Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) and Notch, amongst others, have been suggested to be involved in EMT. We therefore investigated if hypoxia, TGF-β1 and the Notch ligand Jagged-1 alone induced morphological changes with corresponding EMT signatures in different epithelial breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, we also studied whether or not TGF-β1, or Jagged-1 in combination with hypoxia added any effect on EMT.
Methods
The cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia alone or in combination with TGF-β1 or Jagged-1. Morphological responses to treatment were investigated by light microscopy, and changes in markers for EMT and hypoxia were evaluated by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence studies.
Results
One of the four cell lines (MCF7) became elongated and highly multipolar, indicative of EMT, following hypoxia, TGF-β1 and Jagged-1 treatment per se with the most distinct morphological shift seen with Jagged-1 treatment in combination with hypoxia. Also, when regarding hypoxia, MCF7 cells showed the greatest change in EMT-markers of the four cell lines tested, but these changes were not consistent with a typical EMT pattern. The morphology of BT474 cells was not altered following Jagged-1 treatment, however, Jagged-1 increased E-cadherin levels. Morphology was changed following TGF-β1 treatment of BT474 cells, but it did not affect E-cadherin levels. Neither Jagged-1 nor TGF-β1 altered the levels of Vimentin in the BT474 cell line. The E-cadherin responses to hypoxia varied with end-point in both MCF7 and BT474 cells, and in most cases were not consistent with EMT.
Conclusion
Our results using four different breast cancer cell lines in vitro do not provide evidence that EMT is induced by hypoxia alone or in combination with TGF-β1 or the Notch ligand Jagged-1. The inconsistency in morphological appearance and EMT-markers, as well as the time dependent variation in E-cadherin responses could not support EMT. Importantly, there was not one single common response pattern to the stimuli used, suggesting that cell lines with different hormone statuses display individual traits that respond differently to the stimuli applied. Thus, based on the present results, common statements that single factors by themselves can induce EMT seem questionable.

Abstract: Organisms’ reactions to adverse events result in the generation of immune effectors, which, in the case of insects, may be produced from the direct activation of pathways such as Toll, Jak-STAT, Imd, or RNAi or may be derived from the crosstalk of different intracellular pathways. One such pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR), has the primary objective of restoring homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, the UPR participates in signaling crosstalk with the immune pathways, generating protection against pathogenic organisms. Dengue virus is a plus-strand RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus that uses the ER as a replication site; during the infection, there are indicators of the activation of the UPR, which in turn, induces the synthesis of internal membranes and preferential translation of viral proteins enhancing the replication. One of the dengue virus proteins, the NS4B can block the pathway of α/β interferon in mammals. However, what happen in insects is interesting because the lack of the main antiviral pathway, the interferon and the role of the NS4B protein in the UPR-immunity relationship can be better understood. Thus, in this study, we demonstrated that the DENV2/16681 NS4B protein is capable of modulating the immune effectors that result from the activation of the UPR in insect cells.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent proteins (FPs) were recently engineered from bacterial photoreceptors but lack of their systematic comparison makes researcher's choice rather difficult. Here we evaluated side-by-side several modern NIR FPs, such as blue-shifted smURFP and miRFP670, and red-shifted mIFP and miRFP703. We found that among all NIR FPs, miRFP670 had the highest fluorescence intensity in various mammalian cells. For instance, in common HeLa cells miRFP703, mIFP, and smURFP were 2-, 9-, and 53-fold dimmer than miRFP670. Either co-expression of heme oxygenase or incubation of cells with heme precursor weakly affected NIR fluorescence, however, in the latter case elevated cellular autofluorescence. Exogenously added chromophore substantially increased smURFP brightness but only slightly enhanced brightness of other NIR FPs. mIFP showed intermediate, while monomeric miRFP670 and miRFP703 exhibited high binding efficiency of endogenous biliverdin chromophore. This feature makes them easy to use as GFP-like proteins for spectral multiplexing with FPs of visible range.

Abstract: Summary
Brain swelling is a major predictor of mortality in pediatric cerebral malaria (CM). However, the mechanisms leading to swelling remain poorly defined. Here, we combined neuroimaging, parasite transcript profiling, and laboratory blood profiles to develop machine-learning models of malarial retinopathy and brain swelling. We found that parasite var transcripts encoding endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR)-binding domains, in combination with high parasite biomass and low platelet levels, are strong indicators of CM cases with malarial retinopathy. Swelling cases presented low platelet levels and increased transcript abundance of parasite PfEMP1 DC8 and group A EPCR-binding domains. Remarkably, the dominant transcript in 50% of swelling cases encoded PfEMP1 group A CIDRα1.7 domains. Furthermore, a recombinant CIDRα1.7 domain from a pediatric CM brain autopsy inhibited the barrier-protective properties of EPCR in human brain endothelial cells in vitro. Together, these findings suggest a detrimental role for EPCR-binding CIDRα1 domains in brain swelling.

Abstract: Epidermal growth factors (EGFs) e.g. EGF, heparin-binding EGF and transforming growth factor alpha and their receptors e.g. EGFR and ErbB2 control proinflammatory signaling and modulate proliferation in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC). Interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 are EGF targets and participate in the inflammatory phase of bone regeneration via non-canonical wnt signaling. BMSC differentiation is also influenced by mechanical strain-related activation of ERK1/2 and AP-1, but the role of EGFR signaling in mechanotransduction is unclear. We investigated the effects of EGFR signaling in telomerase-immortalized BMSC, transfected with a luciferase reporter, comprising a mechanoresponsive AP1 element, using ligands, neutralizing antibodies and EGFR inhibitors on mechanotransduction and we found that EGF via EGFR increased the response to mechanical strain. Results were confirmed by qPCR analysis of mechanoresponsive genes. EGF-responsive interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 were synergistically enhanced by EGF stimulation and mechanical strain. We show here in immortalized and primary BMSC that EGFR signaling enhances mechanotransduction, indicating that the EGF system is a mechanosensitizer in BMSC. Alterations in mechanosensitivity and -adaptation are contributors to age-related diseases like osteoporosis and the identification of a suitable mechanosensitizer could be beneficial. The role of the synergism of these signaling cascades in physiology and disease remains to be unraveled.

Abstract: Summary
Sustained spermatogenesis in adult males and fertility recovery following germ cell depletion are dependent on undifferentiated spermatogonia. We previously demonstrated a key role for the transcription factor SALL4 in spermatogonial differentiation. However, whether SALL4 has broader roles within spermatogonia remains unclear despite its ability to co-regulate genes with PLZF, a transcription factor required for undifferentiated cell maintenance. Through development of inducible knockout models, we show that short-term integrity of differentiating but not undifferentiated populations requires SALL4. However, SALL4 loss was associated with long-term functional decline of undifferentiated spermatogonia and disrupted stem cell-driven regeneration. Mechanistically, SALL4 associated with the NuRD co-repressor and repressed expression of the tumor suppressor genes Foxl1 and Dusp4. Aberrant Foxl1 activation inhibited undifferentiated cell growth and survival, while DUSP4 suppressed self-renewal pathways. We therefore uncover an essential role for SALL4 in maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonial activity and identify regulatory pathways critical for germline stem cell function.

Abstract: Crustaceans are intensively farmed in aquaculture facilities where they are vulnerable to parasites, bacteria, or viruses, often severely compromising the rearing success. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is crucial for the maintenance of cellular integrity. Analogous to higher vertebrates, the UPS of crustaceans may also play an important role in stress resistance and pathogen defense. We studied the general properties of the proteasome system in the hemocytes of the whiteleg shrimp, Penaeus vannamei, and the European brown shrimp Crangon crangon. The 20S proteasome was the predominant proteasome population in the hemocytes of both species. The specific activities of the trypsin-like (Try-like), chymotrypsin-like (Chy-like), and caspase-like (Cas-like) enzymes of the shrimp proteasome differed between species. P. vannamei exhibited a higher ratio of Try-like to Chy-like activities and Cas-like to Chy-like activities than C. crangon. Notably, the Chy-like activity of P. vannamei showed substrate or product inhibition at concentrations of more than 25 mmol L−1. The KM values ranged from 0.072 mmol L−1 for the Try-like activity of P. vannamei to 0.309 mmol L−1 for the Cas-like activity of C. crangon. Inhibition of the proteasome of P. vannamei by proteasome inhibitors was stronger than in C. crangon. The pH profiles were similar in both species. The Try-like, Chy-like, and Cas-like sites showed the highest activities between pH 7.5 and 8.5. The proteasomes of both species were sensitive against repeated freezing and thawing losing ~80–90% of activity. This study forms the basis for future investigations on the shrimp response against infectious diseases, and the role of the UPS therein.

Abstract: Summary
TRIM25 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that activates RIG-I to promote the antiviral interferon response. The NS1 protein from all strains of influenza A virus binds TRIM25, although not all virus strains block the interferon response, suggesting alternative mechanisms for TRIM25 action. Here we present a nuclear role for TRIM25 in specifically restricting influenza A virus replication. TRIM25 inhibits viral RNA synthesis through a direct mechanism that is independent of its ubiquitin ligase activity and the interferon pathway. This activity can be inhibited by the viral NS1 protein. TRIM25 inhibition of viral RNA synthesis results from its binding to viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), the structures containing individual viral RNA segments, the viral polymerase, and multiple viral nucleoproteins. TRIM25 binding does not inhibit initiation of capped-RNA-primed viral mRNA synthesis by the viral polymerase. Rather, the onset of RNA chain elongation is inhibited because TRIM25 prohibits the movement of RNA into the polymerase complex.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting of human cancer stem cells (CSCs) requires the identification of vulnerabilities unique to CSCs versus healthy resident stem cells (SCs). Unfortunately, dysregulated pathways that support transformed CSCs, such as Wnt/β-catenin signaling, are also critical regulators of healthy SCs. Using the ICG-001 and CWP family of small molecules, we reveal Sam68 as a previously unappreciated modulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling within CSCs. Disruption of CBP-β-catenin interaction via ICG-001/CWP induces the formation of a Sam68-CBP complex in CSCs that alters Wnt signaling toward apoptosis and differentiation induction. Our study identifies Sam68 as a regulator of human CSC vulnerability.

Abstract: Summary
Eliciting broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) responses against HIV-1 is a major goal for a prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine. One approach is to design immunogens based on known broadly neutralizing epitopes. Here we report the design and synthesis of an HIV-1 glycopeptide immunogen derived from the V3 domain. We performed glycopeptide epitope mapping to determine the minimal glycopeptide sequence as the epitope of V3-glycan-specific bNAbs PGT128 and 10-1074. We further constructed a self-adjuvant three-component immunogen that consists of a 33-mer V3 glycopeptide epitope, a universal T helper epitope P30, and a lipopeptide (Pam3CSK4) that serves as a ligand of Toll-like receptor 2. Rabbit immunization revealed that the synthetic self-adjuvant glycopeptide could elicit substantial glycan-dependent antibodies that exhibited broader recognition of HIV-1 gp120s than the non-glycosylated V3 peptide. These results suggest that the self-adjuvant synthetic glycopeptides can serve as an important component to elicit glycan-specific antibodies in HIV vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
During gastrulation, the neuroectoderm cells form the neural tube and neural crest. The nervous system contains significantly more microRNAs than other tissues, but the role of microRNAs in controlling the differentiation of neuroectodermal cells into neural tube epithelial (NTE) cells and neural crest cells (NCCs) remains unknown. Using embryonic stem cell (ESC) neural differentiation systems, we found that miR-29b was upregulated in NTE cells and downregulated in NCCs. MiR-29b promoted the differentiation of ESCs into NTE cells and inhibited their differentiation into NCCs. Accordingly, the inhibition of miR-29b significantly inhibited the differentiation of NTE cells. A mechanistic study revealed that miR-29b targets DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) to regulate neural differentiation. Moreover, miR-29b mediated the function of Pou3f1, a critical neural transcription factor. Therefore, our study showed that the Pou3f1-miR-29b-Dnmt3a regulatory axis was active at the initial stage of neural differentiation and regulated the determination of cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
The H7N9 influenza virus causes high-mortality disease in humans but no effective therapeutics are available. Here we report a human monoclonal antibody, m826, that binds to H7 hemagglutinin (HA) and protects against H7N9 infection. m826 binds to H7N9 HA with subnanomolar affinity at acidic pH and 10-fold lower affinity at neutral pH. The high-resolution (1.9 Å) crystal structure of m826 complexed with H7N9 HA indicates that m826 binds an epitope that may be fully exposed upon pH-induced conformational changes in HA. m826 fully protects mice against lethal challenge with H7N9 virus through mechanisms likely involving antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Interestingly, immunogenetic analysis indicates that m826 is a germline antibody, and m826-like sequences can be identified in H7N9-infected patients, healthy adults, and newborn babies. These m826 properties offer a template for H7N9 vaccine immunogens, a promising candidate therapeutic, and a tool for exploring mechanisms of virus infection inhibition by antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neurons can relieve motor deficits in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical translation of differentiation protocols requires standardization of production procedures, and surface-marker-based cell sorting is considered instrumental for reproducible generation of defined cell products. Here, we demonstrate that integrin-associated protein (IAP) is a cell surface marker suitable for enrichment of hPSC-derived mesDA progenitor cells. Immunomagnetically sorted IAP+ mesDA progenitors showed increased expression of ventral midbrain floor plate markers, lacked expression of pluripotency markers, and differentiated into mature dopaminergic (DA) neurons in vitro. Intrastriatal transplantation of IAP+ cells sorted at day 16 of differentiation in a rat model of PD resulted in functional recovery. Grafts from sorted IAP+ mesDA progenitors were more homogeneous in size and DA neuron density. Thus, we suggest IAP-based sorting for reproducible prospective enrichment of mesDA progenitor cells in clinical cell replacement strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Host-associated microbial communities are influenced by both host genetics and environmental factors. However, factors controlling the human oral microbiome and their impact on disease remain to be investigated. To determine the combined and relative effects of host genotype and environment on oral microbiome composition and caries phenotypes, we profiled the supragingival plaque microbiome of 485 dizygotic and monozygotic twins aged 5–11. Oral microbiome similarity always increased with shared host genotype, regardless of caries state. Additionally, although most of the variation in the oral microbiome was determined by environmental factors, highly heritable oral taxa were identified. The most heritable oral bacteria were not associated with caries state, did not tend to co-occur with other taxa, and decreased in abundance with age and sugar consumption frequency. Thus, while the human oral microbiome composition is influenced by host genetic background, potentially cariogenic taxa are likely not controlled by genetic factors.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer's disease (AD) induces memory and cognitive impairment in the absence of motor and sensory deficits during its early and middle course. A major unresolved question is the basis for this selective neuronal vulnerability. Aβ, which plays a central role in AD pathogenesis, is generated throughout the brain, yet some regions outside of the limbic and cerebral cortices are relatively spared from Aβ plaque deposition and synapse loss. Here, we examine neurons derived from iPSCs of patients harboring an amyloid precursor protein mutation to quantify AD-relevant phenotypes following directed differentiation to rostral fates of the brain (vulnerable) and caudal fates (relatively spared) in AD. We find that both the generation of Aβ and the responsiveness of TAU to Aβ are affected by neuronal cell type, with rostral neurons being more sensitive than caudal neurons. Thus, cell-autonomous factors may in part dictate the pattern of selective regional vulnerability in human neurons in AD.

Abstract: Hypertrophic scar (HS) formation is associated with the fibrosis of fibrocytes caused by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and deposition, the initial event of HS formation. Our high throughput screen of miRNA expression profiles identified hsa-miR31-5p, whose transcription level was most differentially in normal skin fibroblasts (NS) and HS among other miRNAs. The level of hsa-miR31-5p in HS was significantly higher than in NS. In-vitro functional experiments showed hsa-miR31-5p knockdown remarkably suppressed the proliferation of hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSFBs) under hypoxia, promoted cell invasion, and inhibited the expression of Collagen I and III and Fibronectin (FN), suggesting that hsa-miR31-5p knockdown effectively reduces HS formation caused by excessive ECM synthesis and deposition in HSFBs under hypoxia. Mechanism study showed that the regulation of HS formation by hsa-miR31-5p was mediated by its target gene, factor-inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH): under hypoxia, hsa-miR31-5p down-regulated FIH and thus increased the level of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which subsequently activated the HIF-1α fibrosis regulation pathway in HSFBs, and stimulated the proliferation and ECM synthesis in HSFBs, eventually resulting in fibrosis and scar formation. The data also show that knockdown of hsa-miR31-5p in HSFBs impaired the trend of increased proliferation, reduced invasion and excessive ECM synthesis and deposition caused by HIF-1a activation under hypoxia through upregulating FIH, indicating that knockdown of hsa-miR31-5p effectively inhibits the formation of HS. In conclusion, hsa-miR31 -5p plays an important role in HS formation by inhibiting FIH and regulating the HIF-1α pathway. Therefore, hsa-miR31 -5p may be a novel therapeutic target for HS.

Abstract: LDLRAD4 was previously identified and shown to be connected with psychiatric disorders. The structure of LDLRAD4 protein is similar to that of TMEPAI protein, which is overexpressed in many tumors. However, it is still unknown whether LDLRAD4 is involved in tumorigenesis. In this study, the potential role of LDLRAD4 in tumorigenesis was investigated. LDLRAD4 is elevated in hepatic cancer cells and tumor tissues, and expression of LDLRAD4 promotes hepatic cancer cell HepG2 and SMMC-7721 proliferation and migration. LDLRAD4 interacts Nedd4 to promote cell proliferation and migration and negatively regulates the TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy analysis indicates that LDLRAD4 is localized to the lysosome and association with Nedd4 is necessary for its intracellular transport to the lysosome. In addition, depletion of LDLRAD4 in HepG2 liver cancer cells inhibited tumorigenesis in nude mice. These results reveal an oncogenic role of LDLRAD4 in tumorigenesis through its association with Nedd4.

Abstract: Summary
Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the earliest embryonic progenitors in the germline. Correct formation of PGCs is critical to reproductive health as an adult. Recent work has shown that primate PGCs can be differentiated from pluripotent stem cells; however, a bioassay that supports their identity as transplantable germ cells has not been reported. Here, we adopted a xenotransplantation assay by transplanting single-cell suspensions of human and nonhuman primate embryonic Macaca mulatta (rhesus macaque) testes containing PGCs into the seminiferous tubules of adult busulfan-treated nude mice. We discovered that both human and nonhuman primate embryonic testis are xenotransplantable, generating colonies while not generating tumors. Taken together, this work provides two critical references (molecular and functional) for defining transplantable primate PGCs. These results provide a blueprint for differentiating pluripotent stem cells to transplantable PGC-like cells in a species that is amenable to transplantation and fertility studies.

Abstract: Summary
BACE1 is validated as Alzheimer's β-secretase and a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. In examining BACE1-null mice, we discovered that BACE1 deficiency develops abnormal clusters of immature neurons, forming doublecortin-positive neuroblasts, in the developing dentate gyrus, mainly in the subpial zone (SPZ). Such clusters were rarely observed in wild-type SPZ and not reported in other mouse models. To understand their origins and fates, we examined how neuroblasts in BACE1-null SPZ mature and migrate during early postnatal development. We show that such neuroblasts are destined to form Prox1-positive granule cells in the dentate granule cell layer, and mainly mature to form excitatory neurons, but not inhibitory neurons. Mechanistically, higher levels of reelin potentially contribute to abnormal neurogenesis and timely migration in BACE1-null SPZ. Altogether, we demonstrate that BACE1 is a critical regulator in forming the dentate granule cell layer through timely maturation and migration of SPZ neuroblasts.

Abstract: The early preimplantation embryo is susceptible to a range of exogenous stresses which result in their reduced long-term developmental potential. The P53 tumour suppressor protein is normally held at low levels in the preimplantation embryo and we show that culture stress induces the expression of a range of canonical P53-response genes (Mdm2, Bax and Cdkn1a). Culture stress caused a P53-dependent loss of cells from resulting blastocysts, and this was most evident within the inner cell mass population. Culture stress increased the proportion of cells expressing active caspase-3 and undergoing apoptosis, while inhibition of caspase-3 increased the number of cells within the inner cell mass. The P53-dependent loss of cells from the inner cell mass was accompanied by a loss of NANOG-positive epiblast progenitors. Pharmacological activation of P53 by the MDM2 inhibitor, Nutlin-3, also caused increased P53-dependent transcription and the loss of cells from the inner cell mass. This loss of cells could be ameliorated by simultaneous treatment with the P53 inhibitor, Pifithrin-α. Culture stress causes reduced signalling via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signalling pathway, and blocking this pathway caused P53-dependent loss of cells from the inner cell mass. These results point to P53 acting to limit the accumulation and survival of cells within the pluripotent lineage of the blastocyst and provide a molecular framework for the further investigation of the factors determining the effects of stressors on the embryo's developmental potential.

Abstract: Summary
Human endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent a promising source of adult stem cells for vascular repair, yet their regenerative capacity is limited. Here, we set out to understand the molecular mechanism restricting the repair function of ECFCs. We found that key pro-angiogenic pathways are repressed in ECFCs due to the presence of bivalent (H3K27me3/H3K4me3) epigenetic marks, which decreases the cells' regenerative potential. Importantly, ex vivo treatment with a combination of epigenetic drugs that resolves bivalent marks toward the transcriptionally active H3K4me3 state leads to the simultaneous activation of multiple pro-angiogenic signaling pathways (VEGFR, CXCR4, WNT, NOTCH, SHH). This in turn results in improved capacity of ECFCs to form capillary-like networks in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, restoration of perfusion is accelerated upon transplantation of drug-treated ECFCs in a model of hindlimb ischemia. Thus, ex vivo treatment with epigenetic drugs increases the vascular repair properties of ECFCs through transient activation of pro-angiogenic signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus colonization contributes to skin inflammation in diseases such as atopic dermatitis, but the signaling pathways involved are unclear. Herein, epicutaneous S. aureus exposure to mouse skin promoted MyD88-dependent skin inflammation initiated by IL-36, but not IL-1α/β, IL-18, or IL-33. By contrast, an intradermal S. aureus challenge promoted MyD88-dependent host defense initiated by IL-1β rather than IL-36, suggesting that different IL-1 cytokines trigger MyD88 signaling depending on the anatomical depth of S. aureus cutaneous exposure. The bacterial virulence factor PSMα, but not α-toxin or δ-toxin, contributed to the skin inflammation, which was driven by IL-17-producing γδ and CD4+ T cells via direct IL-36R signaling in the T cells. Finally, adoptive transfer of IL-36R-expressing T cells to IL-36R-deficient mice was sufficient for mediating S. aureus-induced skin inflammation. Together, this study defines a previously unknown pathway by which S. aureus epicutaneous exposure promotes skin inflammation involving IL-36R/MyD88-dependent IL-17 T cell responses.

Abstract: Serine proteinases play important roles in innate immunity and insect development. We isolated a serine proteinase gene, designated AccSp10, from the Chinese honeybees (Apis cerana cerana). RT-qPCR and a Western blot analysis at different pupal development stages indicated that AccSp10 might be involved in melanin formation in pupae and promote pupal development. In adult workers, the expression of AccSp10 was upregulated by treatments mimicking harmful environments such as the presence of Bacillus bombysepticus, different temperatures (4, 24 and 42 °C), HgCl2, H2O2 and paraquat; the exception was treatment with VC (vitamin C), which did not upregulate AccSp10 expression. Western blot confirmed the results. A disc diffusion assay indicated that recombinant AccSp10 accelerated E. coli cell death during stimulation with harmful substances (HgCl2, paraquat and cumene hydroperoxide). These findings suggest that AccSp10 may be involved in the pupal development of Chinese honeybees and protection against microorganisms and abiotic harms.

Abstract: Small heat-shock proteins (sHsps), such as αB-crystallin, are one of the major classes of molecular chaperone proteins. In vivo, under conditions of cellular stress, sHsps are the principal defence proteins that prevent large-scale protein aggregation. Progress in determining the structure of sHsps has been significant recently, particularly in relation to the conserved, central and β-sheet structured α-crystallin domain (ACD). However, an understanding of the structure and functional roles of the N- and C-terminal flanking regions has proved elusive mainly because of their unstructured and dynamic nature. In this paper, we propose functional roles for both flanking regions, based around three properties: (i) they act in a localised crowding manner to regulate interactions with target proteins during chaperone action, (ii) they protect the ACD from deleterious amyloid fibril formation and (iii) the flexibility of these regions, particularly at the extreme C-terminus in mammalian sHsps, provides solubility for sHsps under chaperone and non-chaperone conditions. In the eye lens, these properties are highly relevant as the crystallin proteins, in particular the two sHsps αA- and αB-crystallin, are present at very high concentrations.

Abstract: Emerging evidences suggest the impact of autophagy on differentiation but the underlying molecular links between metabolic restructuring and autophagy during monocyte differentiation remain elusive. An increase in PPARγ, HK2 and SIRT6 expression was observed upon PMA induced monocyte differentiation. While PPARγ positively regulated HK2 and SIRT6 expression, the latter served as a negative regulator of HK2. Changes in expression of these metabolic modelers were accompanied by decreased glucose uptake and increase in Chibby, a potent antagonist of β-catenin/Wnt pathway. Knockdown of Chibby abrogated PMA induced differentiation. While inhibition of HK2 either by Lonidamine or siRNA further elevated PMA induced Chibby, mitochondrial ROS, TIGAR and LC3II levels; siRNA mediated knock-down of SIRT6 exhibited contradictory effects as compared to HK2. Notably, inhibition of autophagy increased HK2, diminished Chibby level and CD33 expression. In addition, PMA induced expression of cytoskeletal architectural proteins, CXCR4, phagocytosis, acquisition of macrophage phenotypes and release of pro-inflammatory mediators was found to be HK2 dependent. Collectively, our findings highlight the previously unknown reciprocal influence of SIRT6 and HK2 in regulating autophagy driven monocyte differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro reconstitution and biochemical analysis of natural product biosynthetic pathways remains a challenging endeavor, especially if megaenzymes of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) type are involved. In theory, all biosynthetic steps may be deciphered using mass spectrometry (MS)-based analyses of both the carrier protein-coupled intermediates and the free intermediates. We here report the “total biosynthesis” of the pyrrolo[4,2]benzodiazepine scaffold tomaymycin using an in vitro reconstituted NRPS system. Proteoforms were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-MS to decipher every step of the biosynthesis on its respective megasynthetase with up to 170 kDa in size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a comprehensive analysis of virtually all chemical steps involved in the biosynthesis of nonribosomally synthesized natural products. The study includes experiments to determine substrate specificities of the corresponding A-domains in competition assays by analyzing the adenylation step as well as the transfer to the respective carrier protein domain.

Abstract: Summary
Low pathogenic H7N9 influenza viruses have recently evolved to become highly pathogenic, raising concerns of a pandemic, particularly if these viruses acquire efficient human-to-human transmissibility. We compared a low pathogenic H7N9 virus with a highly pathogenic isolate, and two of its variants that represent neuraminidase inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant subpopulations detected within the isolate. The highly pathogenic H7N9 viruses replicated efficiently in mice, ferrets, and/or nonhuman primates, and were more pathogenic in mice and ferrets than the low pathogenic H7N9 virus, with the exception of the neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant virus, which showed mild-to-moderate attenuation. All viruses transmitted among ferrets via respiratory droplets, and the neuraminidase-sensitive variant killed several of the infected and exposed animals. Neuraminidase inhibitors showed limited effectiveness against these viruses in vivo, but the viruses were susceptible to a polymerase inhibitor. These results suggest that the highly pathogenic H7N9 virus has pandemic potential and should be closely monitored.

Abstract: Summary
The roles of histone demethylases (HDMs) for the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency are incompletely characterized. Here, we show that JmjC-domain-containing protein 1c (JMJD1C), an H3K9 demethylase, is required for mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal. Depletion of Jmjd1c leads to the activation of ERK/MAPK signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to induce differentiation of ESCs. Inhibition of ERK/MAPK signaling rescues the differentiation phenotype caused by Jmjd1c depletion. Mechanistically, JMJD1C, with the help of pluripotency factor KLF4, maintains ESC identity at least in part by regulating the expression of the miR-200 family and miR-290/295 cluster to suppress the ERK/MAPK signaling and EMT. Additionally, we uncover that JMJD1C ensures efficient generation and maintenance of induced pluripotent stem cells, at least partially through controlling the expression of microRNAs. Collectively, we propose an integrated model of epigenetic and transcriptional control mediated by the H3K9 demethylase for ESC self-renewal and somatic cell reprogramming.

Abstract: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is designated a “metabolovirus” due to the intimate connection between the virus and host metabolism. The nutrition state of the host plays a relevant role in the severity of HBV infection. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is prone to increasing HBV DNA loads and accelerating the progression of liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), also named fatty acid translocase, is known to facilitate long-chain fatty acid uptake and contribute to the development of MS. We recently found that CD36 overexpression enhanced HBV replication. In this study, we further explored the mechanism by which CD36 overexpression promotes HBV replication. Our data showed that CD36 overexpression increased HBV replication, and CD36 knockdown inhibited HBV replication. RNA sequencing found some of the differentially expressed genes were involved in calcium ion homeostasis. CD36 overexpression elevated the cytosolic calcium level, and CD36 knockdown decreased the cytosolic calcium level. Calcium chelator BAPTA-AM could override the HBV replication increased by CD36 overexpression, and the calcium activator thapsigargin could improve the HBV replication reduced by CD36 knockdown. We further found that CD36 overexpression activated Src kinase, which plays an important role in the regulation of the store-operated Ca2+ channel. An inhibitor of Src kinase (SU6656) significantly reduced the CD36-induced HBV replication. We identified a novel link between CD36 and HBV replication, which is associated with cytosolic calcium and the Src kinase pathway. CD36 may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CHB patients with MS.

Abstract: Summary
Although STAT3 signaling is demonstrated to regulate sensory cell differentiation and regeneration in the zebrafish, its exact role is still unclear in mammalian cochleae. Here, we report that STAT3 and its activated form are specifically expressed in hair cells during mouse cochlear development. Importantly, conditional cochlear deletion of Stat3 leads to an inhibition on hair cell differentiation in mice in vivo and in vitro. By cell fate analysis, inactivation of STAT3 signaling shifts the cell division modes from asymmetric to symmetric divisions from supporting cells. Moreover, inhibition of Notch signaling stimulates STAT3 phosphorylation, and inactivation of STAT3 signaling attenuates production of supernumerary hair cells induced by a Notch pathway inhibitor. Our findings highlight an important role of the STAT3 signaling during mouse cochlear hair cell differentiation and may have clinical implications for the recovery of hair cell loss-induced hearing impairment.

Abstract: There is now substantial evidence that members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ family) regulate germ cell development in the mouse fetal testis. Correct development of germ cells during fetal life is critical for establishment of effective spermatogenesis and for avoiding the formation of testicular germ cell cancer in later life. Here we consider the evidence for involvement of various TGFβ family members, attempt to reconcile discrepancies and clarify what we believe to be the likely in vivo roles of these factors.

Abstract: Summary
Galeterone is a steroidal CYP17A1 inhibitor, androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, and AR degrader, under evaluation in a phase III clinical trial for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The A/B steroid ring (Δ5,3β-hydroxyl) structure of galeterone is identical to that of cholesterol, which makes endogenous steroids with the same structure (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnenolone) substrates for the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD). We found that galeterone is metabolized by 3βHSD to Δ4-galeterone (D4G), which is further converted by steroid-5α-reductase (SRD5A) to 3-keto-5α-galeterone (5αG), 3α-OH-5α-galeterone, and 3β-OH-5α-galeterone; in vivo it is also converted to the three corresponding 5β-reduced metabolites. D4G inhibits steroidogenesis and suppresses AR protein stability, AR target gene expression, and xenograft growth comparably with galeterone, and further conversion by SRD5A leads to loss of several activities that inhibit the androgen axis that may compromise clinical efficacy. Together, these findings define a critical metabolic class effect of steroidal drugs with a Δ5,3β-hydroxyl structure.

Abstract: Summary
The rise of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has spurred renewed interest in the use of bacteriophages in therapy. However, mechanisms contributing to phage-mediated bacterial clearance in an animal host remain unclear. We investigated the effects of host immunity on the efficacy of phage therapy for acute pneumonia caused by MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a mouse model. Comparing efficacies of phage-curative and prophylactic treatments in healthy immunocompetent, MyD88-deficient, lymphocyte-deficient, and neutrophil-depleted murine hosts revealed that neutrophil-phage synergy is essential for the resolution of pneumonia. Population modeling of in vivo results further showed that neutrophils are required to control both phage-sensitive and emergent phage-resistant variants to clear infection. This “immunophage synergy” contrasts with the paradigm that phage therapy success is largely due to bacterial permissiveness to phage killing. Lastly, therapeutic phages were not cleared by pulmonary immune effector cells and were immunologically well tolerated by lung tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Lowering total tau levels is an attractive therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. High-throughput screening in neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a powerful tool to identify tau-targeted therapeutics. However, such screens have been hampered by heterogeneous neuronal production, high cost and low yield, and multi-step differentiation procedures. We engineered an isogenic iPSC line that harbors an inducible neurogenin 2 transgene, a transcription factor that rapidly converts iPSCs to neurons, integrated at the AAVS1 locus. Using a simplified two-step protocol, we differentiated these iPSCs into cortical glutamatergic neurons with minimal well-to-well variability. We developed a robust high-content screening assay to identify tau-lowering compounds in LOPAC and identified adrenergic receptors agonists as a class of compounds that reduce endogenous human tau. These techniques enable the use of human neurons for high-throughput screening of drugs to treat neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon exposure boosts cell-autonomous immunity for more efficient pathogen control. But how interferon-enhanced immunity protects the cytosol against bacteria and how professionally cytosol-dwelling bacteria avoid clearance are insufficiently understood. Here we demonstrate that the interferon-induced GTPase family of guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) coats Shigella flexneri in a hierarchical manner reliant on GBP1. GBPs inhibit actin-dependent motility and cell-to-cell spread of bacteria but are antagonized by IpaH9.8, a bacterial ubiquitin ligase secreted into the host cytosol. IpaH9.8 ubiquitylates GBP1, GBP2, and GBP4 to cause the proteasome-dependent destruction of existing GBP coats. This ubiquitin coating of Shigella favors the pathogen as it liberates bacteria from GBP encapsulation to resume actin-mediated motility and cell-to-cell spread. We conclude that an important function of GBP recruitment to S. flexneri is to prevent the spread of infection to neighboring cells while IpaH9.8 helps bacterial propagation by counteracting GBP-dependent cell-autonomous immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cell activity in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) decreases with aging, thought to occur by a unidirectional decline. However, by analyzing the V-SVZ transcriptome of male mice at 2, 6, 18, and 22 months, we found that most of the genes that change significantly over time show a reversal of trend, with a maximum or minimum expression at 18 months. In vivo, MASH1+ progenitor cells decreased in number and proliferation between 2 and 18 months but increased between 18 and 22 months. Time-lapse lineage analysis of 944 V-SVZ cells showed that age-related declines in neurogenesis were recapitulated in vitro in clones. However, activated type B/type C cell clones divide slower at 2 to 18 months, then unexpectedly faster at 22 months, with impaired transition to type A neuroblasts. Our findings indicate that aging of the V-SVZ involves significant non-monotonic changes that are programmed within progenitor cells and are observable independent of the aging niche.

Abstract: Summary
Gaucher’s disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene, which encodes acid β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase). Severe GBA1 mutations cause neuropathology that manifests soon after birth, suggesting that GCase deficiency interferes with neuronal development. We found that neuronopathic GD induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) exhibit developmental defects due to downregulation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and that GD iPSCs’ ability to differentiate to dopaminergic (DA) neurons was strikingly reduced due to early loss of DA progenitors. Incubation of the mutant cells with the Wnt activator CHIR99021 (CHIR) or with recombinant GCase restored Wnt/β-catenin signaling and rescued DA differentiation. We also found that GD NPCs exhibit lysosomal dysfunction, which may be involved in Wnt downregulation by mutant GCase. We conclude that neuronopathic mutations in GCase lead to neurodevelopmental abnormalities due to a critical requirement of this enzyme for canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling at early stages of neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The relevance of topographic cues for commitment of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that groove-ridge structures with a periodicity in the submicrometer range induce elongation of iPSC colonies, guide the orientation of apical actin fibers, and direct the polarity of cell division. Elongation of iPSC colonies impacts also on their intrinsic molecular patterning, which seems to be orchestrated from the rim of the colonies. BMP4-induced differentiation is enhanced in elongated colonies, and the submicron grooves impact on the spatial modulation of YAP activity upon induction with this morphogen. Interestingly, TAZ, a YAP paralog, shows distinct cytoskeletal localization in iPSCs. These findings demonstrate that topography can guide orientation and organization of iPSC colonies, which may affect the interaction between mechanosensors and mechanotransducers in iPSCs.

Abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and often fatal lung disease characterized by fibroblast proliferation and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. Both TGF-β and Wnt signaling have been implicated in the regulation of organ fibrosis. However little is known about whether TGF-β-induced gene expression changes in Wnt signaling pathway could predict disease progression. In the study, we investigated the interaction between TGF-β and Wnt signaling in mediating pulmonary fibrosis by big data analysis, in vitro and in vivo experimental studies and clinical data analysis. We found that TGF-β1 treatment induces a marked upregulation of Frizzled-7 (FZD7) in human lung fibroblasts. FZD7 expression is also increased in animal models of TGF-β1-induced pulmonary fibrosis. TGF-β1 upregulated FZD7 expression in a Smad3-dependent manner. Functionally, knockdown of FZD7 inhibits TGF-β1-induced expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen I (Col I), fibronectin and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). FZD7 inhibition further attenuates TGF-β1-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Finally our data demonstrated that FZD7 transmits non-canonical Wnt signaling by interacting Wnt5A in the regulation of ECM expression.
Conclusion
These results suggest that FZD7-targeted therapeutic strategies may be applicable for treating an array of fibrotic diseases.

Abstract: The development of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) holds great promise for regenerative medicine. However the iPSC induction efficiency is still very low and with lengthy reprogramming process. We utilized the highly potent transactivation domain (TAD) of MYC protein to engineer the human OCT4 fusion proteins. Applying the MYC-TAD-OCT4 fusion proteins in mouse iPSC generation leads to shorter reprogramming dynamics, with earlier activation of pluripotent markers in reprogrammed cells than wild type OCT4 (wt-OCT4). Dramatic enhancement of iPSC colony induction efficiency and shortened reprogramming dynamics were observed when these MYC-TAD-OCT4 fusion proteins were used to reprogram primary human cells. The OCT4 fusion proteins induced human iPSCs are pluripotent. We further show that the MYC Box I (MBI) is dispensable while both MBII and the linking region between MBI/II are essential for the enhanced reprogramming activity of MYC-TAD-OCT4 fusion protein. Consistent with an enhanced transcription activity, the engineered OCT4 significantly stimulated the expression of genes specifically targeted by OCT4-alone, OCT4/SOX2, and OCT4/SOX2/KLF4 during human iPSC induction, compared with the wt-OCT4. The MYC-TAD-OCT4 fusion proteins we generated will be valuable tools for studying the reprogramming mechanisms and for efficient iPSC generation for humans as well as for other species.

Abstract: Annexin A6 (AnxA6) has been implicated in the regulation of endo-/exocytic pathways, cholesterol transport, and the formation of multifactorial signaling complexes in many different cell types. More recently, AnxA6 has also been linked to triglyceride storage in adipocytes. Here we investigated the potential role of AnxA6 in fatty acid (FA) – induced lipid droplet (LD) formation in hepatocytes. AnxA6 was associated with LD from rat liver and HuH7 hepatocytes. In oleic acid (OA) -loaded HuH7 cells, substantial amounts of AnxA6 bound to LD in a Ca2+-independent manner. Remarkably, stable or transient AnxA6 overexpression in HuH7 cells led to elevated LD numbers/size and neutral lipid staining under control conditions as well as after OA loading compared to controls. In contrast, overexpression of AnxA1, AnxA2 and AnxA8 did not impact on OA-induced lipid accumulation. On the other hand, incubation of AnxA6-depleted HuH7 cells or primary hepatocytes from AnxA6 KO-mice with OA led to reduced FA accumulation and LD numbers. Furthermore, morphological analysis of liver sections from A6-KO mice revealed significantly lower LD numbers compared to wildtype animals. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α)-dependent LD formation was ineffective in AnxA6-depleted HuH7 cells. We conclude that cPLA2α-dependent pathways contribute to the novel regulatory role of hepatic AnxA6 in LD formation.

Abstract: The birth of new neurons, or neurogenesis, in the adult midbrain is important for progressing dopamine cell-replacement therapies for Parkinson's disease. Most studies suggest newborn cells remain undifferentiated or differentiate into glia within the adult midbrain. However, some studies suggest nestin+neural precursor cells (NPCs) have a propensity to generate new neurons here. We sought to confirm this by administering tamoxifen to adult NesCreERT2/R26eYFP transgenic mice, which permanently labelled adult nestin-expressing cells and their progeny with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP). eYFP+ midbrain cells were then characterized 1–32weeks later in acutely prepared brain slices using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology combined with single-cell RT-qPCR. Most eYFP+ cells exhibited a mature neuronal phenotype with large amplitude fast action potentials (APs), spontaneous post-synaptic currents (sPSCs), and expression of ‘mature’ neuronal genes (NeuN, Gad1, Gad2 and/or VGLUT2). This was the case even at the earliest time-point following tamoxifen (i.e. 1week). In comparison to neighboring eYFP− (control) cells, eYFP+ cells discharged more APs per unit current injection, and had faster AP time-to-peak, hyperpolarized resting membrane potential, smaller membrane capacitance and shorter duration sPSCs. eYFP+ cells were also differentiated from eYFP− cells by increased expression of ‘immature’ pro-neuronal genes (Pax6, Ngn2 and/or Msx1). However, further analyses failed to reveal evidence of a place of birth, neuronal differentiation, maturation and integration indicative of classical neurogenesis. Thus our findings do not support the notion that nestin+NPCs in the adult SNc and midbrain generate new neurons via classical neurogenesis. Rather, they raise the possibility that mature neurons express nestin under unknown circumstances, and that this is associated with altered physiology and gene expression.
