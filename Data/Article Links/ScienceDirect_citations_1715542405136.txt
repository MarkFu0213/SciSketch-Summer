Abstract: The tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB2 is frequently found to be overexpressed in multiple cancer types. Targeted therapeutic approaches against ErbB2 have shown promising results and received FDA approvals in the treatment of breast cancer. However, this approach has not been granted in ovarian cancers till now. In order to assess the validity of ErbB2-targeted therapy in ovarian cancer, we investigated the effectiveness of two FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors of ErbB2, lapatinib and neratinib, on the growth of ovarian cancers. We observed that both lapatinib and neratinib displayed inhibitory effects towards the proliferation and migration of ErbB2-positive ovarian cancer cells in vitro, with neratinib showing stronger suppression in general. Neratinib treatment led to the reduction of ErbB2 protein levels, with concomitant attenuation of the phosphorylation of AKT, MEK, and ERK1/2. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that neratinib induced the internalization and lysosomal degradation of ErbB2, which was accompanied by its hyperubiquitylation. Lapatinib and neratinib also repressed the in vivo growth of SKOV3 cells, and neratinib downregulated ErbB2 levels in xenograft tumors to cause potent inhibition. Therefore, the ubiquitylation-mediated endocytic degradation of ErbB2 incurred by neratinib treatment conferred potent inhibition of ovarian cancer growth. Clinical investigations of neratinib in ErbB2-positive ovarian cancer are warranted.

Abstract: Background
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a Mendelian single gene disorder with highly variable phenotypic expression. In the present study, we analyzed the influence of HbF, alpha thalassemia and other hematological indices to determine their association with acute pain episodes.
Method
This case control study consisted of SCD subjects with HbS phenotype experiencing three or more acute pain episodes in last twelve months (cases) and without any episode of acute pain during last twelve months (controls). Hematological parameters, HbF, and presence of alpha thalassemia were assessed in all subjects.
Results
A statistically significant difference between HbF levels (P < 0.025, χ2 test) and alpha thalassemia (P < 0.008, χ2 test) was observed between controls and cases group. Univariate analysis indicated that increased HbF levels > 25% (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.18‐0.77, P < 0.008) and presence of alpha thalassemia (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.33–0.85, P < 0.009) provided protection, while multivariate analysis revealed significant protection was attributable only by higher HbF levels (OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.17–0.88, P < 0.025). Significantly higher HbF levels were observed only in the 11–20 age group of cases in comparison to controls (Student's t-test, P < 0.001).
Conclusion
Higher concentrations of HbF are associated with protection against frequent episodes of acute pain crisis in SCD patients.

Abstract: In this study, children with sickle cell anemia were evaluated for iron deficiency. Serum ferritin and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) levels, mean corpuscular volume mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) were used in determining their iron status. The study was done at Pediatric Hematology Outpatient Clinic of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals’ Complex, Ile-Ife. Forty-eight HbSS subjects in steady state and 48 apparently well age and sex matched HbAA controls were evaluated. Serum ferritin less than 25ng/dL FEP greater than cut off for age, mean corpuscular volume MCV and mean corpuscular hemoglobin MCH less than cut off for age were regarded as indicating iron deficiency. Serum ferritin values ranged from 34.2 to 3282.9μg/L, with a mean of 381.2 (1.0), median 180μg/L; which was significantly higher than the controls (p=0.000). FEP was lower in the subjects but none was iron deficient compared with the controls. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin MCH of subjects was significantly lower than the controls. Subjects had lower mean corpuscular volume MCV compared with controls. Iron deficiency was not detected in any of the subjects with sickle cell anemia in comparison to a prevalence of 43.75% in the controls. Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) was found in 16.7% of the controls, using the WHO cut off for anemia which is hemoglobin concentration of <11g/dl. While a high prevalence of iron deficiency was noted in the control group, patients with sickle cell anemia were largely iron sufficient, despite their anemia. Iron supplementation remains unnecessary as part of routine management of children with sickle cell anemia in our practice.

Abstract: Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, characterized by insulin resistance, corresponds to approximately 90% of cases of diabetes worldwide. Hyperglycemia in diabetes contributes to hyperfibrinogenemia and activates the coagulation cascade thereby producing atherothrombotic events.
Objectives
This study was designed to evaluate the coagulation profile (activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and fibrinogen) in Type 2 diabetes and to analyze correlations between body mass index, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin and duration of diabetes with coagulation parameters.
Methods
This study included 60 type 2 diabetics and 30 controls. Diabetic patients were grouped in two sets based on the presence or absence of microvascular complications. The demographic profile and clinical details were recorded. Fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, coagulation parameters such as prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen along with other biochemical parameters were investigated.
Results
There were statistically significant differences in the coagulation parameters between the two groups of diabetics (with and without complications). The present study also found significant correlations between age and the duration of diabetes with and without complications and coagulation parameters such as the activated partial thromboplastin time, which was found to be significantly lower, and fibrinogen, which was found to be significantly higher in subjects with complications compared to subjects without complications.
Conclusion
Clinical tests for prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen are relatively inexpensive and readily available. The present study shows that shortened prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and increased fibrinogen levels might be useful hemostatic markers in diabetic patients, especially in those at high-risk for thrombotic complications.

Abstract: Background
This study aimed to define the sex-divided reference intervals for platelet indices (mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR) and plateletcrit (PCT)) on the Sysmex XN-10.
Methods
A total of 2376 samples were assayed for full blood count on the Sysmex XN-10 haematology analyzer. After removing the outliers, reference intervals were calculated using the mean±2SD. The P value 0.05 was adopted to denote statistical significance.
Results
There was a statistical significance (α=0.05) between sex-divided reference intervals for MPV (p=0.007), P-LCR (p=0.015) and PCT (p<0.001), thus separate reference intervals were calculated for these indices, with orientation to the sex-divisions as follows: MPV, 9.1–13.0fL [males] and 9.2–12.8fL [females]; P-LCR, 17.6–47.0% [males] and 17.8–47.8% [females]; and PCT, 0.16–0.35% [males] and 0.18–0.37% [females]. No significance was found between sex-divided reference intervals for the PDW (p=0.838), therefore a reference interval for total individuals was calculated for this platelet measurement as 9.3–17.3fL.
Conclusion
This study showed comparable reference intervals, using the Sysmex XN-10, with the previous literature. It determined the need to define sex-specific reference intervals for the MPV, P-LCR and PCT, but not for the PDW. These reference intervals will allow for low and high values to be facilitated in order to do further research and guide platelet disorder management.

Abstract: Background
Heterogeneity regarding clinical and laboratory findings at diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia exists. The frequency of complete blood count abnormalities and its combinations, symptoms and physical findings were investigated in Hispanic children from an open population at the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Methods
The patient charts and electronic records of under 16-year-old children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia over 10 years at a regional hematology center of a university hospital were analyzed to retrieve data concerning the complete blood count at first evaluation. Type and distribution of abnormal data, frequency of symptoms and physical findings at presentation were documented.
Results
The records of 203 children aged 0–15 years diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia from 2006 to 2016 were revisited. The results of the blood workup showed a median white blood cell count of 7120×109/L (range: 450–600,000×109/L), and a median hemoglobin concentration of 7.5g/dL (range: 2.4–15.3g/dL), whereas the median platelet count was 47,400×109/L (range: 4000–544,000×109/L). Leukocytosis and leukopenia were present in 36.6% and 36.1% of cases, respectively; anemia was diagnosed in 82.9% children. The order of frequency for major clinical symptoms was fatigue 62%, fever 60%, bone and joint pain 39%, hyporexia 33% and weight loss 21%, while main physical findings were hepatomegaly 78%, splenomegaly 63%, lymphadenopathy 57%, pallor 48%, and purpura 30%.
Conclusion
Data differing from those classically expected at diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children were documented in a cohort of Hispanic children over one decade with a wide spectrum of complete blood count abnormalities, forms of presentation and frequency of physical findings.

Abstract: Introduction
Carriers of oncohematological diseases are at high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
Objective and method
To investigate the epidemiology of HBV infection in Goiânia, Central Brazil, 322 individuals with oncohematological diseases (leukemias, Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) were interviewed and blood samples were collected for the detection of serological markers of HBV-DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Medical records of participants were also reviewed.
Results
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (n=99) and chronic myeloid leukemia (n=108) were the most frequent oncohematological diseases. The overall prevalence of HBV was 13.97% (45/322). Of the total participants, 8.69% (28/322) presented isolated positivity for anti-HBs, suggesting low vaccine coverage. HBV-DNA was detected in 25% (1/4) of HBsAg positive samples and in 25% (3/12) of anti-HBc isolated, suggesting HBV occult infection. All samples were identified as subgenotype A1. Entries in patient records and the findings of this investigation suggest anti-HBc seroconversion during oncologic treatment. Age 50 years or over and use of a central catheter during therapy were associated with HBV exposure.
Conclusion
The low frequency of hepatitis B immunized individuals, detection of HBV DNA in HBsAg negative samples, and the suggestion of HBV exposure during treatment evidenced the potential for health-related viral dissemination in people with oncohematological diseases in our region, reinforcing the importance of serological monitoring, vaccination against hepatitis B, and adoption of strict infection control measures in these individuals.

Abstract: Solar energy has received considerable attention over the past few decades, due to its importance as a green and renewable energy. Low-cost solar-grade silicon production is critical for the widespread use of solar cells. Conventional routes (e.g., modified Siemens process: chlorosilane and hot filament) have still dominated the production of solar-grade silicon. The metallurgical route offers benefits in the productivity and cost, but efficient removal of boron is one of the most daunting challenges in front of us. This paper reviews thermodynamic and kinetic properties (solubility, diffusivity, diffusion coefficients, mass transfer rate, and activity coefficient) of boron and recent research topics (slag treatment, solvent refining, gas injection, plasma treatment, and acid leaching) for boron removal.

Abstract: Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), are the key autoinducer molecules that mediate Pseudomonas aeruginosa associated quorum sensing. P. aeruginosa produces two types of AHLs; N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12 HSL) and N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone (C4 HSL). AHLs are not only regulating the virulence gene of bacteria but also influence the host cell functions by interkingdom signaling. In this study, we explored the mechanism of AHLs induced calcium mobilization in human platelets. We found that 3-oxo-C12 HSL but not C4 HSL induces intracellular calcium release. 3-oxo-C12 HSL induced calcium mobilization was majorly contributed from the dense tubular system (DTS). Furthermore, 3-oxo-C12 HSL also stimulates the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in platelet. Intracellular calcium rise was significantly lowered in rotenone, and bafilomycin pre-treated platelets suggesting partial involvement of mitochondria and acidic vacuoles. The significant effect of 3-oxo-C12 HSL on calcium mobilization can alter the platelet functions that might results in thrombotic disorders in individuals infected with P. aeruginosa.

Abstract: The development of solar thermal energy storage technologies associated with phase change materials (PCMs) can greatly improve the utilization efficiency of solar energy, which is of significance to alleviate the global energy shortage. A large number of photodriven shape-stabilized composite PCMs has been exploited in recent decades, while the majorities of studies have demonstrated that the properties of composite PCMs are improved at the expense of energy storage density owing to that the introduced functional materials are substituted for a considerable portion of phase change matrix. Here, three-dimensional (3D) porous skeletons composed of bacterial cellulose (BC) as the supporting material and MXene as the photothermal material are introduced into polyethylene glycol (PEG) to fabricate composite PCMs with excellent comprehensive properties. The obtained composite PCMs show excellent shape stability, efficient photothermal conversion ability and extremely high energy storage capacity, which sheds substantial light on the efficient utilization of solar energy.

Abstract: Detection of HFE Haemochromatosis (HH) is challenging in the absence of clinical features. HH subjects have elevated erythrocyte parameters compared to those without HH, but it remains unclear how this could be applied in clinical practice. Thus, we determined the sensitivity, specificity and clinical utility of erythrocyte parameters in 144 HH subjects with (n = 122) or without (n = 22) clinical and/or biochemical expression of iron overload, 1844 general population controls, and 700 chronic disease subjects. For both expressing and non-expressing HH subjects, the mean pre- and post-phlebotomy values of mean cell volume (MCV) and mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) were always significantly higher when compared to all other groups and demonstrated excellent diagnostic utility for detection of HH in men and women (AUROC 0.83–0.9; maximal sensitivity and specificity 82% and 78%) using cut-off values for MCV >91 fL or MCH >31 pg, respectively. Between 34 and 62% of all HH subjects would be detected, and <4% of all non-HH subjects would undergo unnecessary testing, if those with MCV or MCH values >94 fL or 32.2 pg, respectively, were evaluated.

Abstract: Background
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a neglected burden of growing importance. >312,000 births are affected annually by sickle cell anaemia (SCA). Early interventions such as newborn screening, penicillin prophylaxis and hydroxyurea can substantially reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with SCD. Nevertheless, their implementation in African countries has been mostly limited to pilot projects. Recent development of low-cost point-of-care testing (POCT) devices for sickle haemoglobin (HbS) could greatly facilitate the diagnosis of those affected.
Methods
We conducted the first multi-centre, real-world assessment of a low-cost POCT device, HemoTypeSC, in a low-income country. Between September and November 2017, we screened 1121 babies using both HemoTypeSC and HPLC and confirmed discordant samples by molecular diagnosis.
Findings
We found that, in optimal field conditions, the sensitivity and specificity of the test for SCA were 93.4% and 99.9%, respectively. All 14 carriers of haemoglobin C were successfully identified. Our study reveals an overall accuracy of 99.1%, but also highlights the importance of rigorous data collection, staff training and accurate confirmatory testing. It suggests that HPLC results might not be as reliable in a resource-poor setting as usually considered.
Interpretation
The use of such a POCT device can be scaled up and routinely used across multiple healthcare centres in sub-Saharan Africa, which would offer great potential for the identification and management of vast numbers of individuals affected by SCD who are currently undiagnosed.

Abstract: Spermiogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster is a highly conserved process and essential for male fertility. In this haploid phase of spermatogenesis, motile sperm are assembled from round cells, and flagella and needle-shaped nuclei with highly compacted genomes are formed. As transcription takes place mainly in spermatocytes and transcripts relevant for post-meiotic sperm development are translationally repressed for days, we comparatively analysed the proteome of larval testes (only germ cell stages before meiotic divisions), testes of 1–2-day-old pupae (germ cell stages before meiotic divisions, meiotic and early spermatid stages) and adult flies (germ cell stages before meiotic divisions, meiotic and early spermatid stages, late spermatids and sperm). We identified 6,171 proteins; 61 proteins were detected solely in one stage and are thus enriched, namely 34 in larval testes, 77 in pupal testes and 214 in adult testes. To substantiate our mass spectrometric data, we analysed the stage-specific synthesis and importance for male fertility of a number of uncharacterized proteins. For example, Mst84B (gene CG1988), a very basic cysteine- and lysine-rich nuclear protein and was present in the transition phase from a histone-based to a protamine-based chromatin structure. CG6332 encodes d-Theg, which is related to the mouse tHEG and human THEG proteins. Mutants of d-Theg were sterile due to the lack of sperm in the seminal vesicles. Our catalogue of proteins of the different stages of testis development in D. melanogaster will pave the road for future analyses of spermatogenesis.

Abstract: Chronic mountain sickness (CMS) has a higher incidence in the plateau region and is characterized by excessive erythrocytosis and hypoxemia. Bcl-2 family plays an important role in the process of erythropoiesis and the regulation of apoptosis. This study aimed to examine the change in apoptosis of erythroblasts in CMS patients and explore the involvement of Bcl-2 family. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation from 18 CMS patients and 17 control participants. The apoptotic rate, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), the protein expression of caspase-3, TNFR, Fas, Bcl-2, Bax and Cyt-C were examined by flow cytometry, and mRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR. The results showed that apoptotic rate of erythroblasts was lower and MMP was higher in CMS group than in control group. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Bcl-2 were higher while Bax level was lower in CMS group than in control group. In CMS group, the apoptosis rate of CD71+ erythroblasts was negatively correlated with the ratio of CD71+ cells in BMMNCs and positively correlated with hemoglobin level. In conclusion, erythroblasts apoptosis is decreased due to the regulation of the expression of Bcl-2 family members in the erythroblasts of CMS patients.

Abstract: Background
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a potentially fatal hematological disease. Along with disease-related factors, patient-related factors, in particular age, are a strong predictor of outcome that influence treatment decisions. Many acute myeloid leukemia risk stratification models have been developed to predict the outcome of intensive chemotherapy. However, these models did not include physical function assessments.

This study investigated the impact of several factors, namely the performance status, physical function and age on the short-term outcomes of intensive chemotherapy in a cohort of 50 Egyptian patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia.
Results
Complete remission after intensive chemotherapy in these myeloid leukemia patients at Day 28 was 56% and the mortality rate was 12% and 34% at Day 28 and Day 60, respectively. The pretreatment Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score was significantly correlated with outcomes on Day 28 and Day 60 (p-value=0.041 and p-value=0.032, respectively). There were significant correlations between the two-minute walk test and outcomes of therapy on Day 28 and 60 (p-value=0.032 and p-value=0.047, respectively) and between grip strength test and outcomes of therapy on Day 28 and 60 (p-value=0.046 and p-value=0.047 respectively). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between chair stand test and outcome of therapy on Day 28 (p-value=0.023).
Conclusion
Performance status and physical function assessments were strong predictors of outcome of intensive chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia and we recommend the incorporation of these variables in risk stratification models for the personalization of therapy before treating acute myeloid leukemia patients with intensive chemotherapy.

Abstract: Taliglucerase alfa, the first available plant cell–expressed recombinant therapeutic protein, is an enzyme replacement therapy approved for Gaucher disease (GD). PB-06-001, a pivotal phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-dose study investigated taliglucerase alfa 30 or 60U/kg every other week through 9months in treatment-naïve adults with GD; 30-month extension study PB-06-003 followed. Patients completing PB-06-001 and PB-06-003 could continue treatment in PB-06-007. Nineteen patients enrolled in PB-06-007 (30U/kg, n=8; 60U/kg, n=9; dose adjusted, n=2); 17 completed 5 total years of treatment. In these 3 groups, respectively, taliglucerase alfa resulted in mean decreases in spleen volume (−8.7, −6.9, −12.4 multiples of normal), liver volume (−0.6, −0.4, −0.5 multiples of normal), chitotriosidase activity (−83.1%, −93.4%, −87.9%), and chemokine (CC motif) ligand 18 concentration (−66.7%, −83.3%, −78.9%), as well as mean increases in hemoglobin concentration (+2.1, +2.1, +1.8mg/dL) and platelet count (+31,871, +106,800, +34,000/mm3). The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis and arthralgia. Most adverse events were mild/moderate; no serious adverse events were considered treatment-related. These results demonstrate continued improvement of disease parameters during 5years of taliglucerase alfa therapy in 17 treatment-naive patients with no new safety concerns, extending the taliglucerase alfa clinical efficacy and safety dataset. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01422187.

Abstract: We present epitaxial 1.7 eV/1.1 eV GaAs0.75P0.25/Si tandem cells with an NREL-certified efficiency of 20.0%, enabled by a thermally stable tunnel junction interconnect along with a hydrogenated amorphous Si (a-Si:H) carrier-selective contact for the Si bottom cell. Building on these promising tandem results, we also demonstrate a 16.5%-efficient GaAs0.75P0.25 single-junction top cell on Si and a 7.78%-efficient GaAs0.75P0.25-filtered Si bottom cell (both NREL-certified) with improved short-circuit current densities. The quantum efficiency of the GaAs0.75P0.25 single-junction top cell on Si is boosted across the whole wavelength range due to the use of a higher growth temperature, indicating an improved minority-carrier diffusion length. The implementation of random pyramid texturing at the Si back surface enables improved quantum efficiency at wavelengths of 900–1200 nm, corresponding to an increase of 1.42 mA/cm2 in short-circuit current density. The improved short-circuit current densities of the sub-cells together show a pathway to >23% efficiency in a two-terminal tandem configuration.

Abstract: Background
In order to standardize a thrombin generation() protocol, we analyzed the analytical variables and sensitivity of this test to hypo/hypercoagulability states.
Methods
The effect of the tissue factor concentration and the intra- and interassay precision were analyzed. To evaluate the hypercoagulability status, the plasma of women under an oral contraceptive was tested, while plasma from hemophilia A patients at 1, 3 and 7 days after recombinant FVIII infusion, and lyophilized plasma deficient in FVII or FVIII were used for the evaluation of hypocoagulability.
Results
The intra-assay coefficient of variation was <10% with 1 and 5pM of low and high TF. The oral contraceptive users showed increased thrombin generation in comparison to non-users, which was more pronounced with low TF (endogenous thrombin potential ETP) p=0.0009; peak p=0.0009; lagtime p=0.0008). In relation to the FVIII-deficient plasma, a higher TG was observed as FVIII levels were increased and a better discrimination was obtained for different concentrations of FVIII with low TF (ETP p<0.0001; peak p<0.0001; lagtime p=0.0004). Using low TF, plasma from hemophilia A patients showed higher TG values after 1 day of recombinant FVIII infusion vs after 3 days (ETP p<0.0001; peak p<0.0001; lagtime p=0.0407), while the lowest values were observed after 7 days. With FVII-deficient plasma, thrombin generation was lower than normal plasma and a more pronounced difference was observed with high TF compared to low TF (ETP p<0.0001; peak p<0.0001; lagtime p<0.0001).
Conclusion
Under our conditions the thrombin generation test seems to be sensitive to evaluation of hyper/hypocoagulability states. Standardization of the thrombin generation test may have an application in the evaluation of bleeding and thrombotic disorders.

Abstract: Objectives
To describe cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities observed in children and adolescents with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), classify AML according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classifications from 2008 and 2016, and evaluate the prognosis according to clinical characteristics and cytogenetic abnormalities.
Methods
A retrospective longitudinal study was performed on a population of 98 patients with AML, aged up to 16 years, seen in a single hospital from 2004 to 2015.
Results
Among the 80 patients for whom it was possible to analyze the karyotype, 78.7% had chromosomal changes, the most frequent being t(15;17)(q22;q21). Of the 86 patients for whom we had cytogenetic or molecular data, making it possible to classify their AML according to the WHO classification, 52.3% belonged to the group with recurrent genetic abnormalities, 22% to the “AML not otherwise specified” group, 18.6% to the group with myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic changes, and 7% to the group with Down syndrome-related leukemia. Five-year overall survival (OS) for the whole group was 49.7%±5.2%. In the univariate and multivariate analyses, patients with myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic changes (OS 28.1%±12.2%) and those with “AML not otherwise specified” (OS 36.1%±11.2%) had an unfavorable prognosis when compared to patients with AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities (OS 71%±5.8%) and patients with Down syndrome-related AML (OS 83%±15.2%, p=0.011).
Conclusions
The results corroborate the importance of cytogenetic abnormalities as a prognostic factor and indicate the need for cooperative and prospective studies to evaluate the applicability of the WHO classification in the pediatric population.

Abstract: Background
Despite advances in health care for sickle cell disease patients, as well as in the improvement in reproductive issues mainly in women with the disease, pregnancy is still a challenge, both for the mother and the child, with high rates of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Besides their chronic hemolytic status and vaso-occlusive events that confer systemic complications, pregnant women also have higher rates of pain episodes, infections, abortion, intrauterine growth retardation, pre-term births, eclampsia, stillbirth and the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syndrome. The physiologic mechanisms of the disease in pregnancy are still unknown and chronic inflammatory responses may interfere in the adverse outcomes. The cytokine and chemokine profiles in pregnancy with sickle cell disease remain unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytokine profile of the inflammatory response of pregnant women with sickle cell disease.
Method
Blood samples from 20 pregnant women with sickle cell disease, 24 women with sickle cell disease in steady state, 16 healthy pregnant women and a control group with 9 women at childbearing age were assayed for interleukin-6.
Main results
Pregnant women with sickle cell disease presented high serum levels of interleukin-6, compared to healthy pregnant women (p=0.0115).
Conclusion
These data suggest that the increased production of interleukin-6 may occur during pregnancy with sickle cell disease and that the role of this cytokine in the sickle cell disease pathophysiology and pregnancy complications should be further studied.

Abstract: Background and aims
Myelodysplasia (MDS) is characterised by abnormal haematopoiesis and increased risk of bleeding. Microvesicles (MV) play a key role in coagulation and their impact in MDS is unknown.
Methods
Platelet free plasma from 35 red-cell transfusion-dependent MDS patients and 15 controls were analysed. Pro-coagulant function was assessed by the XaCT assay and by thrombin generation (ETP). Total MV were enumerated by nano-tracking analysis. MV subsets were quantified by flow cytometry after staining with specific antibodies for various endovascular cell types. Small RNA was quantitated and sequenced. The MV measurements were correlated with MDS clinical risk scores and level of transfusion dependence.
Results
The pro-coagulant function of MV was significantly lower in MDS. All the MV subtypes, as measured by flow cytometric markers, were also significantly lower. The small RNA and miRNA cargo were significantly higher in MDS. The miRNA profile showed that mir-28 and mir-LETD7 were under expressed whilst mir-584J and mir-4485 were over expressed in MV from MDS.
Conclusions
Circulating MV in MDS show reduced pro-coagulant functional activity, reduced subtypes by flow cytometry and significantly different miRNA content. However, the levels or subtypes of MV did not predict the clinical phenotype or level of transfusion dependence.

Abstract: Liquid phase crystallization of silicon is a promising technology platform to grow multi crystalline silicon thin films on foreign substrates. For solar cell application it has already been demonstrated that open circuit voltages of up to 661 mV [1] and efficiencies of up to 15.9% [2] can be achieved on a silicon layer of a few microns only. However, while the quality of the material has been continuously improved, the cost factor of the utilized substrate has been given little attention. The present work focuses on the technology transfer from technical glass substrates to low cost soda-lime glass substrates to become more attractive for commercial applications. We demonstrate that despite a large difference in the expansion coefficient between soda lime glass and silicon absorber layer, adhesive silicon thin films can be produced under certain conditions. On these first layers, we were able to fabricate solar cells, which in their cell and material properties were only ~30% below the values of their technical glass counterparts.

Abstract: Classical Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms include Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF). They are characterized by the presence of driver mutations of JAK2, CALR or MPL genes. Overexpression of WT1 is used as a marker of minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia, especially after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). We investigated WT1 expression at diagnosis in 152 MPN patients and showed that the WT1 transcript was overexpressed in PMFs and PVs compared to controls. In particular, WT1 transcript levels were higher in PMF than in ET and PV. WT1 transcript levels were significantly increased during myelofibrotic transformation of ET or PV. Using multivariate linear regression, high WT1 transcript levels in PMF were associated with age over 65, splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. The ROC curve analysis showed that a level of WT1 transcript >10 WT1 copies/104ABL1 enabled the diagnosis of PMF with a specificity of 95.8% (PMF vs ET; ROC AUC = 0.91). In myelofibrosis, studying follow-ups of WT1 transcript showed that this marker is of interest after allogeneic SCT. These results demonstrate that WT1 overexpression is a simple marker of myelofibrosis in MPN and could be used during patient follow-up.

Abstract: We retrospectively analyzed 101 primary MDS patients with complex karyotype during January 2010 and April 2017.The median overall survival (OS) time was 13 (95% CI 9.98–16.02) months, and there was no significant difference in OS for different treatment. Chromosome 5/7 involvement was common (78.22%, 79/101) and associated with shorter OS (12 months vs. 28 months, P < 0.01) Monosomal karyotype (MK) is overlapped with CK in 79 patients, but was not statistically associated with shorter OS. While in 59 cases with genes sequenced, 57 (96.61%) patients were found to have at least one mutation of known significance, and TP53 was the most frequent (74.58%, 44/59), the median OS of patients with TP53 mutation was shorter than those without (10 vs. 27 months, P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only TP53 mutation was the strongest independent prognostic factor for OS. Moreover, high variant allele frequency (VAF) of TP53 mutation (median VAF was 70.00%) was seen and associated with adverse survival (9 months vs. 13 months, p = 0.04). In conclusion, MDS patients with CK implied an unfavorable outcome regardless of any treatment, TP53 mutation occurs at a high frequency and has a higher VAF, both were associated with worse survival.

Abstract: Solvent engineering has been considered a reliable process for the fabrication of pinhole-free and highly crystalline perovskite thin films. Recently, green solvents have received immense attention, as the toxic antisolvents used in the conventional fabrication process cause environmental and health hazards. In this regard, ethyl acetate (EA) is a promising environmentally friendly antisolvent. Here, we present the fabrication of perovskites with controlled morphologies by changing the composition of the perovskite and the volume of EA in ambient humidity. The incorporation of [HC(NH2)2]PbIBr2 into a CH3NH3PbI3 matrix results in a grain size up to ~1.5 μm. This induces a considerable reduction of trap density, leading to the suppression of charge recombination and, consequently, improvement in the photoluminescence characteristics. The resulting power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the optimized devices are 20.93% and 19.51% for active areas of 0.12 cm2 and 0.7 cm2, respectively. The reduced diffusion of moisture along grain boundaries improves device stability. Further, by virtue of the excellent humidity resistance of EA, the film morphologies obtained at high relative humidity (50%) are similar to those obtained under dry conditions, exhibiting an impressive PCE of 20.11%. We believe that our optimized fabrication process using EA can be extended to other green antisolvent systems.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate the incidence of thrombotic events in patients heterozygous for FXII deficiency during a long observation period.
Patients and methods
103 heterozygotes for FXII deficiency, 49 female and 54 male were followed for 19.6 years (range 5–32 years). As controls 103 unaffected family members of same sex and similar age (±5 years) were enrolled. The thrombotic end points were: myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and ischemic stroke. The mean Factor XII level in the heterozygotes was 48.5%: range (35–60%) that of control was 96.5% (range 70–155%). The heterozygotes showed one myocardial infarction, two deep vein thromboses and no ischemic stroke. The unaffected family members observed 2 myocardial infarctions, one deep vein thrombosis and one ischemic stroke. There were seven deliveries (five women) among the heterozygotes and six (five women) among the controls. Furthermore, four and five surgical procedures were carried out in the patient and in the control group, respectively. Immobilization times for surgical procedures or pregnancies were 50 days and 57 days for the heterozygotes and the unaffected family members, respectively. Heterozygotes for FXII deficiency did not show an increased incidence of thrombotic events as compared with unaffected family members during a long follow up.

Abstract: Although Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-mediated transactivation potential is inhibited in cancer cells, the mechanism is poorly understood. In the present study, we implicated long non-coding RNA lncRNA625 in the inhibition of STAT1 activity. LncRNA625 knockdown up-regulated STAT1-mediated transcription and resulted in an increase of STAT1-mediated expression of IFITM2. Conversely, lncRNA625 upregulation inhibited STAT1 reporter activity. Mechanistically, lncRNA625 inhibited STAT1 binding to the promoter of IFITM2 in both untreated cells and following interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) stimulation. LncRNA625 interacted with the DNA-binding (DB) domain of STAT1 and promoted STAT1 interaction with T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase TC45 to dephosphorylate pSTAT1. Taken together, the results show that lncRNA625 inhibits STAT1-mediated transactivation potential by causing formation of STAT1-TC45 complexes, resulting in STAT1 dephosphorylation.

Abstract: Autophagy is primarily considered as an important survival mechanism for both normal cells and cancer cells in response to metabolic stress or chemotherapy; but the role of autophagy in leukemogenesis is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to explore the role of intrinsic autophagy in the leukemogenesis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In this study, conditional knockout mice Atg7f/f;Ubc-Cre, in which an autophagy-essential gene Atg7 is universally deleted, were used as recipients, B-ALL cell line 697 was used as donor cells to generate leukemia mouse model. Compared to wild-type mice, Atg7 knockout mice were more susceptible to engrafted leukemogenesis, shown by increase in white blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelets, decrease in HSPC number and its colony-forming unit (CFU). The liver and spleen displayed hepatosplenomegaly and inflammatory cell infiltration. Furthermore, second competitive transplantation revealed dysfunction of the HSPC in Atg7-knockout leukemia mice represented by destructive self-renew ability (CFU) and reconstitution ability including decreased B220, Ter 119 cells, and increased Gr-1 cell percentage. In summary, Mice with universal deletion of Atg7 are more inclined to the occurrence of engrafted human leukemia, which is largely attributed to the deterioration of the function of HSPC in autophagy deficient mice.

Abstract: We report a cooperative study conducted between different laboratories to investigate organic solar cell degradation with respect to P3HT material properties and different solar cell architectures. Various batches of P3HT were collected from different suppliers reflecting commercial availability as well as properties variability. Among the materials properties explicitly considered were the molar mass, dispersity, regio-regularity, impurities by trace metals and intrinsic doping evaluated from radical concentrations. Each of the participating laboratories contributing test devices applied their own layer stack, i.e. their own device architecture and layout. This variation was appreciated as another parameter for evaluation. Even though a large amount of devices failed due to extrinsic degradation effects, indeed, some materials properties were found to be more important than others for obtaining long lifetimes and high stability of P3HT-based polymer solar cells.

Abstract: The air exposure oxidation mechanisms of PbS quantum dot (QD) thin films and solar cells are studied in the current paper. As a novel and advantageous method, QD thin films were prepared by the single-step deposition of colloidal QDs treated with different ligands of butylamine (BA), mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI) and methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3, perovskite). Photoluminescence (PL) measurements evaluated the stability of different surface treated PbS QDs during the colloidal to thin film transformation, and over the air exposure times. Blue-shift and quenching the PL spectra suggested rapid oxidation of QD thin films at the first times of air exposure. However, the oxidation rates significantly reduced for the QD thin films treated with organic MPA and all the inorganic ligands. According to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies, thin films oxidation accompanied with the formation of PbSO3 and PbSO4 compounds on the (100) facets of PbS QDs. Although MAPbI3 treatment led to the complete passivation of QDs in the air, perovskite shelling partially oxidized to PbO and PbCO3 compounds. Furthermore, the PL enhancement phenomenon observed at the first times of air exposure for the TBAI and MAPbI3-treated QD thin films, as a result of their strong surface passivation as well as the photoenhancement and photoelectrification mechanisms. Eventually, p-n and p-i-n structured solar cells were fabricated by the single-step deposition of solution-phase treated PbS QD inks. In this case, inorganic surface treatments not only increased the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells, but also led to a high stability of fabricated devices in the air environment (lower than 1% PCE loss after 500 h of storage in the air).

Abstract: Background
Preeclampsia is one of the major health problems causing maternal morbidity and mortality, complicating 3–8% of pregnancies. It has been suggested that the alterations in the coagulation and fibrinolysis play a role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The markers of platelet activation include platelet count, platelet distribution width, mean platelet volume and plateletcrit.
Study design
It was a case-controlled study which included a total of 60 patients (30 cases and 30 controls). Blood samples were collected and the platelet indices – platelet count, plateletcrit, mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width – were evaluated using the Sysmex XN1000 and compared between the two groups.
Results
The MPV and PDW also showed a significant difference (p>0.05) between the two groups, with a significant positive correlation with increasing blood pressure (MPV – r=+0.6126, p<0.05 and PDW – r=+0.6441, p<0.05). The PC and PCT had lower values in the preeclampsia patients, however the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.
Conclusion
The MPV and PDW showed a significant difference between the two groups and increasing values with increasing BP. However, the PC and PCT in our study did not show a significant correlation with preeclampsia. Thus, the platelet indices, mainly the MPV and PDW, which are economical and easily available, can be reliable in the prediction and early diagnosis of preeclampsia, as well as a marker for the severity of preeclampsia.

Abstract: Although conventional therapeutic approaches have brought remarkable advantages for the treatment of breast cancer (BC), drug-resistance still remains as a leading cause of tumor recurrence in this malignancy. In the present study, we designed experiments to evaluate the therapeutic value of PI3K inhibition in combination with Arsenic trioxide (ATO) in MCF-7 cells. The results of our study manifested that BKM120 sensitized MCF-7 cells to the lower concentrations of ATO. The significant anti-cancer effect of PI3K inhibition became even more evident when we found that BKM120, either as a single agent or in combination with ATO, reduced clonogenic ability of anoikis-resistant stem-like MCF-7 cells. Our findings also showed that BKM120 augmented ATO-induced anti-proliferative effects through inducing G1 arrest and reducing the incorporation of BrdU into the synthesized DNA of drugs-treated cells, which was coupled with c-Myc-mediated suppression of hTERT expression. Moreover, we found that in the presence of PI3K inhibitor, ATO is able to more profoundly induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, as revealed by the increment in the percentage of haplodiploid sub-G1 cells and the externalization of phosphatidylserine. Real-time PCR analysis also revealed that probably down-regulation of survivin coupled with up-regulation of forkhead family transcription factors is responsible for the enhancive effect of drugs in this cell line. Conclusively, this study shed lights on the effect of PI3K inhibition in chemo-sensitivity of MCF-7 cells, disclosing that combination of BKM120 and ATO could be a promising therapeutic approach in BC.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the chemical composition of a reactively sputtered photochromic YHxOy thin film by non-destructive ion beam-based techniques, i.e., Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry, Particle-Induced X-Ray Emission, Time-of-Flight/Energy coincidence Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis and Elastic Backscattering Spectrometry. To enhance the accuracy of the analysis, the set of spectra was evaluated in an iterative self-consistent approach. This procedure resulted in high-resolution depth profiles of the chemical composition and revealed a thin oxygen-rich-layer on the surface, which apparently does not act as a self-passivation layer. In the film, the concentration of Y remains practically constant, whereas O replaces H during the oxidation process. In-situ light illumination was performed during the compositional analysis in a high vacuum setup. The results from these measurements demonstrate that, for these samples, the induced reversible photochromism is not linked to any detectable change in the bulk composition of the film and can thus take place even in a vacuum environment.

Abstract: Introduction
The ETV6-RUNX1 is a fusion gene associated with a good outcome in B-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia.
Objective
This study aimed to re-evaluate the CD9 cellular expression by flow cytometry (FC) as a possible tool to predict the presence of ETV6-RUNX1.
Method
Childhood B-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia cases were included (n=186). The percentage of CD9-labeled cells and the median fluorescence intensity ratio were used for correlation with the molecular tests. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves were performed to determine the likelihood of the CD9 expression predicting ETV6-RUNX1.
Results
The ETV6-RUNX1 was found in 44/186 (23.6%) cases. Data analysis revealed that the best cutoff for CD9 percentage was 64%, with an accuracy of 0.84, whereas the best cutoff for CD9 median fluorescence intensity ratio was 12.52, with an accuracy of 0.80. A strong association was observed between the level of CD9 expression and the presence of ETV6-RUNX1.
Conclusion
These data confirm that the CD9 expression could be used for risk stratification in clinical practice.

Abstract: The true electrocatalyst of water oxidation in a number of cases proved to be an in situ developed ‘CuO’ film instead of (or beside) the original Cu complex itself, since the breaking of metal-ligand interactions under the applied conditions often successfully compete with the homogeneous process. The decomposition of a catalyst candidate is obviously unwanted; on the other hand, inexpensive and controllable precursor complexes represent an exciting platform to fabricate nanostructured metal oxide coatings utilized in artificial photosynthesis. We investigated the Cu-triglycine complex equilibrium system with uniform {N,N,N,O}eq peptide binding mode throughout the pH range of ~7 to 10 in borate buffer. In the presence of the complex under the conditions of water oxidation electrocatalysis the development of a ‘CuO’ nanoparticle coating was observed on the indium tin oxide working electrode. This coating acted as a robust electrocatalyst of water oxidation. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated a mixed Cu2O/CuO/Cu(OH)2 surface composition. Fine coatings could be also fabricated on different electrodes including glassy carbon, boron-doped diamond and an n-type semiconducting α-Fe2O3 nanoarray, importantly, without ruining its morphology. We identified the interplay between the co-existent borate equilibrium species and the Cu-triglycine system as the key factor to define the dominant process and allow control over the deposition.

Abstract: Objective
This is a quantitative transversal study that aimed to analyze the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of thalassemia major patients with and without diabetes mellitus.
Method
The cohort consisted of 31 thalassemia major patients from a reference center of treatment in Brazil in 2016. The data were obtained from an interview using a questionnaire containing demographic and clinical variables. The results show that 16.1% of the participants with thalassemia major had diabetes mellitus. The participants’ ages ranged from 20 to 48 years, with an average of 35 years, mostly students and starting in the formal job market. The most commonly used treatment was the oral desferasirox and the transfusion treatment interval was 15–22 days.
Results
Patients with thalassemia major and diabetes mellitus presented altered values of fasting glycemia, serum alanine transaminase, magnetic resonance imaging and bone densitometry.
Conclusion
It was concluded that knowledge of the characteristics of this population contributes in the proposal of effective educational strategies in light of the complexity of care and the progression of the disease.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes has become an epidemic disease largely explained by the dramatic increase in obesity in recent years. Mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested as an underlying factor in obesity and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we evaluated changes in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis in a new human obesity and type 2 diabetes model, TALLYHO/Jng mice. We hypothesized that the sequence variants identified in the whole genome analysis of TALLYHO/Jng mice would affect oxidative phosphorylation and contribute to obesity and insulin resistant phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated differences in the expression and activity of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, including the transcription and translation of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded subunits and enzymatic activities, in the liver and kidney of TALLYHO/Jng and C57BL/6 J mice. A significant decrease was observed in the expression of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded subunits of complex I and IV, respectively, in TALLYHO/Jng mice, which coincided with significant reductions in their enzymatic activities. Furthermore, sequence variants were identified in oxidative phosphorylation complex subunits, a mitochondrial tRNA synthetase, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. Our data suggested that the lower expression and activity of oxidative phosphorylation complexes results in the diminished energy metabolism observed in TALLYHO/Jng mice. Sequence variants identified in mitochondrial proteins accentuated a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis which also contributes to impaired biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation in TALLYHO/Jng mice. These results demonstrated that the identification of factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction will allow us to improve the disease prognosis and treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans.

Abstract: Recently, a new erythroid regulator, erythroferrone (ERFE), which downregulates hepatic hepcidin production, has been identified. However, the relationship between ERFE and abnormal iron metabolism in MDS is unclear. In this study, we examined the level of ERFE mRNA during ex vivo erythroid differentiation using cord blood CD34+ cells and we further analyzed whether ERFE could be produced by MDS cells using a public database (GSE58831). ERFE mRNA was increased during normal erythroid differentiation. An analysis of GSE58831 indicated that ERFE expression in bone marrow (BM) MDS cells was higher than that in healthy volunteer (HV)–derived BM cells. ERFE expression significantly and positively correlated with the expression of erythropoietin (EPO) receptors (EPO-R), ALAS2 (5’-Aminolevulinate Synthase 2), STEAP3 (STEAP family member 3) and the presence of ring sideroblasts or the SF3B1 mutation. These results suggest that EPO-R+ MDS cells with ring sideroblasts or an SF3B1 mutation produce high levels of ERFE that may be associated with a reduction in hepcidin.

Abstract: Background
Benign ethnic neutropenia (BEN), defined by neutrophil count <1.5 k/μL in the absence of other causes, is an asymptomatic condition more commonly observed in individuals of African ancestry. However, the natural history of this condition has been less well described.
Methods
Individuals with BEN were retrospectively identified by chart review or referral to hematology clinics. They were then invited to enroll in a prospective natural history study. Retrospective and prospective clinical and laboratory data were combined for descriptive analyses.
Findings
46 participants, younger and older adults from 2 institutions, had BEN. Hypertension was reported in 30%, musculoskeletal disorders in 15%, and upper respiratory infection in 33% of these adults. Their leukopenia resulted from isolated neutropenia, ranging from 1000 and 1500 cells/μL. The severity of infections was mild and the frequency was similar to other healthy individuals in the ambulatory clinic.
Interpretation
In this group of BEN participants, their leukopenia was stable over time, and they had low rates of infections or common medical disorders, confirming the benign nature of this condition. The presence of BEN in children, younger adults, and older adults suggest a hereditary pattern for BEN.

Abstract: Objective
Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) has been described as a rare complication after splenectomy. PVT associated risk factors after splenectomy in hematological disorders are poorly recognized. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and risk factors of PVT incidence in splenectomized patients.
Methods
One hundred twelve splenectomized patients with various hematologic diseases between 2008 and 2018 were enrolled in this study. Diagnosis was confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography (DUSG) and risk factors for PVT were sought based on the comparison of clinical and laboratory features between patients without and with PVT.
Result
PVT was diagnosed in 4 (3.57%) patients in spite of receiving antiplatelet therapy. Patients with PVT were β-thalassemia major (n = 2) and β-thalassemia intermedia (n = 2). β-thalassemia patients had a 3.5 times higher odds for PVT (95% CI: 2.41–5.33). No significant differences between patients with and without PVT in terms of age, gender and laboratory features were found.
Conclusion
According to our data, β-thalassemia, especially intermediate form, may be a risk factor for PVT and it can occur in spite of receiving antiplatelet therapy. Given that β-thalassemia patients are at risk, early PVT detection may be useful for reduction of fatal PVT complication in splenectomized patients.

Abstract: miR-145-5p has been reported to be downregulated and described functioning as a tumor suppressive gene in colorectal cancer (CRC), yet its detailed regulatory function and mechanism in malignant progression of the disease have not been thoroughly understood. In our study, miR-145-5p and rhomboid domain containing 1 (RHBDD1) in CRC tissues and cells were examined by qRT-PCR and western blot. MTT, colony formation, wound healing, Transwell invasion, and flow cytometry assays were performed to evaluate the malignant phenotypes of CRC cells. Xenograft tumor, qRT-PCR, and western blot assays were applied to validate the roles and mechanism of miR-145-5p in CRC in vivo. The interaction between miR-145-5p and RHBDD1 was investigated by luciferase reporter assay and western blot. The changes of the EGFR/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway were detected by western blot. We found miR-145-5p was lowly expressed and low miR-145-5p predicted poor prognosis in CRC, while RHBDD1 was greatly enhanced in CRC cells and tissues. RHBDD1 silencing resulted in inhibiting cell proliferative, invasive, and migratory potentials as well as elevating apoptotic ones in CRC cells. miR-145-5p was inversely related with RHBDD1 expression in CRC tissues. miR-145-5p was found to directly bind to RHBDD1 and restrained its expression in CRC cells. miR-145-5p overexpression repressed CRC cell proliferation, invasion, migration and induced apoptosis, and these effects were reversed by RHBDD1 upregulation. Moreover, in CRC xenograft tumor, its growth was impeded by miR-145-5p via suppressing RHBDD1. Furthermore, miR-145-5p inhibited the expression of EGFR, p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2, in vitro and in vivo by targeting RHBDD1. In conclusion, our study revealed that miR-145-5p overexpression inhibited tumorigenesis in CRC by downregulating RHBDD1 via suppressing the EGFR-associated signaling pathway (EGFR/Raf/MEK/ERK cascades).

Abstract: Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (RGNEF) is a 190 kDa protein implicated in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cancer. Under normal physiological conditions, RGNEF is predominantly cytoplasmic with moderate levels of nuclear localization. We have identified a 23-amino acid region containing a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain of RGNEF, which when deleted or mutated abolishes the nuclear localization of this protein. Fusion proteins containing only the PH domain demonstrated that this region by itself is able to translocate a 160 kDa protein to the nucleus. Interestingly, we also detected a nuclear export signal (NES) within the linker region of this bipartite NLS which is able to export from the nucleus a fusion protein containing two NLSs. Experiments using Leptomycin-B -an inhibitor of nuclear export- confirmed that this region promotes nuclear export in an exportin-1 dependent manner. This study is the first report demonstrating either of these signals embedded within a PH domain. Notably, this is also the first description of a functional overlapped NLS/NES signal.

Abstract: Reevaluation of the deferral from voluntary blood donation by men who have sex with men (MSM) is being discussed in several countries, motivated by the need to ensure a blood supply free from transfusion-transmissible infections (e.g., HIV, syphilis). Policies being considered include: permanent exclusion for any male-male sexual encounter, temporary deferral (3 months, 12 months, 5 years) from the last encounter, or specifying behaviors that differentiate MSM at high risk from those at low risk. Current Brazilian regulations defer MSM from blood donation for 12-months after the last male-male sexual encounter. Broad epidemiological evidence indicates that many MSM are at increased risk for HIV in the present era, and few data exist to distinguish which men are likely to be in the immunological window for detection of these infections. A multicenter study developed in Brazil demonstrated that the history of male-male sex was the most strongly associated with being an HIV-positive blood donor. Meanwhile, the blanket deferral of MSM from blood donation has generated considerable controversy. Rejection of the deferral policies stems in part from perspectives defending human rights, promoting equality and citizenship, and alleging bias and discrimination. The objective of this report is to discuss the current situation of blood donation among MSM in Brazil. We highlight the lack of evidence for a true risk profile for male-male sex in the context of blood donation upon which to base sound policy. We recommend research to establish effective and acceptable criteria for blood donation by MSM and other blood donors.

Abstract: Background
Lutheran and Dombrock are two blood group systems with low immunogenic antigens; they can cause mild-to-moderate transfusion reactions. For both, immunophenotyping is not performed in the pretransfusion routine in Brazil. In addition, the distribution of their antigenic frequencies is an important marker of ethnicity. Thus, the goal of this study was to carry out the genotyping of the LU*01, LU*02, DO*01 and DO*02 alleles of the Lutheran and Dombrock blood group systems in blood donors from the southwestern region of the state of Paraná, Southern Brazil.
Method
Genotyping was performed for 251 blood donors by specific allele-polymerase chain reaction. The genotype and allele frequencies were obtained through direct counting and compared with other Brazilian populations using the chi-square test with Yates correction.

The distribution of genotype frequencies for LU were 0.4% for LU*01/LU*01, 6.8% for LU*01/LU*02 and 92.8% for LU*02/LU*02 and for DO, they were 19.9% for DO*01/DO*01, 44.6% for DO*01/DO*02 and 35.5% for DO*02/DO*02. The allele and genotype frequencies of LU and DO were similar to those expected for Caucasians, but the DO*01/DO*01 genotype frequency was different to other Brazilian populations. The rare LU*01/LU*01 genotype was found in a loyal blood donor.
Conclusion
The genotyping techniques allowed the evaluation of the LU*01, LU*02, DO*01 and DO*02 alleles in blood donors registered in the Hemotherapy Center of the southwestern region of Paraná, Southern Brazil, and contributed to a genotyped blood donor database.

Abstract: Acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) is a rare, potentially fatal bleeding disorder caused by low activity of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in patients without congenital deficiency. The majority of adult cases are associated with hematological malignancy, including lymphoproliferative (48%) or myeloproliferative (15%) disorders (Federici et al., 2000). Both qualitative and quantitative defects occur, due to antibody-mediated clearance or functional interference, increased proteolysis, absorption to malignant cells or platelets, or increased shear stress due to valvular defects or mechanical vascular devices (Tiede et al., 2011). The predominant mechanism for decreased or absent VWF in malignancy is autoantibodies that are inhibitory to VWF function or shorten VWF survival (Kumar et al., 2002 [3]). Antibody-mediated clearance occurs through inactivating antibody directed towards VWF, antibody binding the non-active sites of VWF, and nonspecific antibodies that form circulating immune complexes with VWF, enhancing clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (Mannucci et al., 1984). Bleeding may be very difficult to treat due to reduced half-life of VWF-concentrates.

Abstract: Background
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a potentially fatal disease that requires early diagnosis and treatment that can be made possible by applying the PLASMIC score. This study aims to evaluate this score applicability for patients with suspected TTP in a developing country.
Methods
This was a retrospective study performed at a tertiary hospital in the northeastern region of Brazil. Patients were analyzed in two groups: ADAMTS13 activity <10% and activity >10%. Patients were stratified according to the PLASMIC score, and the level of agreement between the PLASMIC score and the ADAMTS13 activity was evaluated.
Results
Eight patients with thrombotic microangiopathy were included. Four patients had ADAMTS13 activity <10%, all with a PLASMIC score =6. The other four had ADAMTS13 activity >10%, all with a score <6. Based on a score =6 for presumptive diagnosis of TTP, we attained a 100% diagnostic accuracy in our sample. The PLASMIC score was also able to accurately predict response to plasma exchange and the risk of long-term unfavorable outcomes.
Conclusions
The reproducibility of the PLASMIC score was quite satisfactory in our sample. It accurately discriminates between patients who had ADAMTS13 deficiency and those with normal enzyme activity, precluding the need for specific laboratory evaluation, which is not always available. This score can be useful for an early diagnosis and indicates which patients will benefit from the treatment in developing countries.

Abstract: Chloride molten salt is required to study its corrosion behavior since it is recommended to be used as heat transfer and heat storage material in high-temperature thermal power generation system. In this paper, a simplify model was established by the reaction of diffusive corrosive gas and metal substrate in a chloride molten salt. A cellular automaton model based on the stochastic approach is adopted to simulate the uniform corrosion and the migration of metallic element. The corrosion behavior is also simulated considering the practical working condition, such as oxygen, moisture and so on. By comparing the simulation results with experimental data, it proves that the cellular automata simulation is an effective alternative method to describe the high-temperature corrosion process of molten salts. Simulation results of 25,000 time steps is taken as a comparison of the 21-day corrosion which reflects the Cr distribution, and the growth of corrosion layer with the migration of Cr element was reproduced. The change of corrosion layer thickness is similar to the mass loss. The simulation method provides insight on the distribution of corrosion products, corrosion kinetics and morphologies for the long-term application.

Abstract: Background
We previously demonstrated CD133+ bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) to promote hepatic proliferation for liver regeneration. Here, we evaluated the capacity of CD133+BMSC to utilize platelets for homing to vasculature and concomitant controlling their aggregability upon ADP stimulation.
Methods
CD133+BMSC and platelets were co-cultured along micro endothelial cells under variable flow conditions and tested for homing levels along vasculature. Aggregometry and FACS analysis were utilized to evaluate platelet reactivity following co-incubation ± CD133+BMSC. RT-PCR and FACS analyses served to characterize ADP degrading ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (ectoNTPDase-1/CD39) expression on various cell types.
Results
Platelets attracted human CD133+BMSC to autologous micro endothelium under shear stress unaffected by ADP stimulation. However, CD133+BMSC inhibited ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. Latter was dependent on ectoNTPDase-1 expression levels. Platelet aggregatory control was increased with CD133+BMSC compared to CD133+PHSC. Different effects of those stem cell subtypes positively correlated with their FACS-detected expression levels of ectoNTPDase-1.
Conclusion
We provide evidence that CD133+BMSC are capable of controlling ADP-dependent platelet aggregation and activation by direct interaction dependent on cellular expression of ectoNTPDase-1. Whether different capacities of BMSC modulate platelet-depending thrombogenicity at sites of regeneration impact effectiveness and adverse event profiles of regenerative treatment requires further evaluation.

Abstract: Introduction and objective
Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon, indolent B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Therapy with cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) is able to induce complete remission (CR) in the majority of patients after a single course of treatment. We report the outcomes of patients treated at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan.
Methods
This was a retrospective review. Medical records of patients were used to collect data.
Results
A total of 21 patients with hairy cell leukemia were treated with cladribine. All patients achieved an initial CR. Four patients (19%) required hospitalization and therapy for neutropenic fever. Six patients (29%) relapsed at a median of 48 months. All 6 patients were treated for relapse, out of which 4 achieved CR, 1 had partial response and 1 had refractory disease. The overall survival rate was 90.5%, with a median follow-up of 35 months.
Conclusion
A single course of cladribine is able to induce CR in a vast majority of patients. Unfortunately, relapse is not uncommon. Patients who relapse can be successfully retreated with cladribine. Cladribine has impressive efficacy and a favorable acute and long-term toxicity profile when administered to patients with HCL.

Abstract: Massive production of graphene is synthesized by a low-cost electro-chemically exfoliated approach and then incorporated with γ-alumina for developing a novel carbon composite ink, graphene/γ-alumina ink. It is coated onto the glass by spraying with an adiabatic closed system as the thermal and optical barriers for the energy efficient glass of the business buildings. The coating thickness of graphene/γ-alumina layer is around 2~3 μm. The temperature in an adiabatic closed system is measured with a heat source by lamp radiation. The temperature difference between inside and outside of the adiabatic closed system can achieve around 20 °C with the coating of 0.3 wt% of electro-chemically exfoliated graphene incorporated with 1 wt% of γ-alumina in N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone after thermal radiation test for 15 h. The transmittance is adjustable from 5.57%–81% at 550 nm wavelength, depending on the composition and content of graphene and γ-alumina. The coating of the carbon composite ink, electro-chemically exfoliated graphene with γ-alumina are also good absorbents for UV absorbance.

Abstract: Background
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, among non-Hodgkin lymphomas, is one of the most frequent subtypes. Clinical laboratory data and post-treatment outcomes are scarce in the Brazilian population.
Objective
The main objective of this retrospective study was to assess the impact of tumor markers, including the Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) mutation.
Method
Eighty-three patients were included and treated with R-CHOP or R-CHOP-like regimens.
Results
Median age was 64-years old and 58% were female patients. The median follow-up was 42 months. The progression free survival (PFS) at this time was 63% and overall survival (OS), 66%. In the patients with tumors expressing Myc proto-oncogene protein (MYC) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), known as dual protein expressers, median post-progression survival was 31 (15–45) months. An increased proliferative index were associated with a high rate of progression (hazard ratio 2.31 [95% confidence interval [1.05–5.12]; p=0.04). The cell of origin (COO), identified by IHC, was not able to predict PFS (p=0.76). The MYD88 L265P mutation was present in 10.8% (9/83) of patients and did not show a prognostic correlation.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the MYD88 mutation, although an important tool for diagnosis and a possible target drug, presented at a low frequency and was not a prognostic marker in this population.

Abstract: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and all-cause mortality. MetS prevalence among adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) is not well known. We report initial findings from a cross-sectional study that examined MetS risk factors within a cohort of adults living with SCD. 50 adult SCD participants (ages 21–66 years; 72% female) completed demographic and health behavior surveys, health-related family and personal histories, and anthropometric and laboratory measurements. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarize and compare CVD risk factors, stratified in separate analyses by SCD genotype and sex. Triglyceride, blood pressure, and fasting glucose levels were within normal limits. 78% of the cohort reported moderate to high physical activity. However, 46% of this cohort was overweight and dietary saturated fat intake exceeded both the national average (11%) and US Dietary Guidelines (<10%). 14.3% of the cohort fulfilled criteria for MetS with large waist circumference and reduced HDL levels prominently accounting for this status. We evaluated the prevalence of MetS in a cohort of adults living with SCD. Our findings suggest that increased attention to eating habits and physical activity may generate new approaches for decreasing cardiovascular morbidity in SCD.

Abstract: Yorki (Yki), a transcriptional co-activator that is a key component of the Hippo pathway, induces the transcription of a number of targets that promote cell proliferation and survival. Bombyx mori Yki3 (BmYki3), with 445 amino acid residues, facilitates cell migration and cell division, and enlarges cultured cell and wing disc size. In this study, cellular localization, transcriptional co-activator activity, cell migration, cell cycle, and cell size were characterized in alternative isoforms of BmYki. BmYki1 and BmYki3 are mainly located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, while, BmYki2 is located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. The mutation BmYki1S97A (S97mutated to A) was transported from the cytoplasm to nucleus. Cell migration, cell cycle, and cell size could be enhanced by BmYki, however, the effect of BmYki1 and BmYki2 on cell proliferation was less compared to BmYki3. Moreover, wing discs could be enlarged by overexpressing BmYki1 or BmYki2 isoforms. Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that BmYki3 had the highest activity to B. mori ovarian tumor gene. In BmN cells overexpressing one of the BmYki isoforms, expression levels of kibra ortholog (kibra), inhibitor of apoptosis protein (iap), four-jointed (fj), expanded (ex), crumbs (crb) and BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor homolog (Bmpr) genes were upregulated, while those of α-catenin (α-cat), decapentaplegic (dpp), serrate (serr) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) genes were down-regulated. There was some difference in the regulation of gene expression between different isoforms. These results suggested that the activity of BmYki isoforms was different in the silkworm.

Abstract: Zebrafish is emerging as a promising model for the study of human cancers. Several xenograft models of zebrafish have been developed, particularly in larval stages (<48 h post fertilization) when the immune system of fish is not developed. However, xenografting in adult zebrafish requires laborious and transient methods of immune suppression (γ- irradiation or dexamethasone) that limits engraftment and survival of the tumor or fail to recapitulate specific characteristics of malignancies. Thus, the availability of a simple protocol to successfully engraft adult zebrafish, remains a challenge. The current study addresses this limitation and describes a robust method of xenografting in adult zebrafish. We describe a protocol that involves pre-conditioning of Casper, a pigmentation mutant of zebrafish with busulfan that led to a higher rate of engraftment of hepatocellular carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia cells. To further ascertain the homing characteristics of the injected cancer cells, we transplanted adult zebrafish by two routes of administration and then studied their compartmentalization. This model presents a valuable alternative to rodents to study the biology of these cancers and also a cost-effective platform for evaluation of potential anti-cancer agents.

Abstract: Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) remains the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. Endothelium semipermeable barrier function plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Recently, Roundabout protein 4 (Robo4), interaction with its ligand Slit 2, was appreciated as a modulator of endothelial permeability and integrity. However, not much is known about the role of Slit2/Robo4 signaling pathway in the pathophysiology of TRALI. In this study, the TRALI model was performed by the “two-event” model of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN)-mediated pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) damage. We investigated the expression of Slit2/Robo4 and VE-cadherin and examined the pulmonary endothelial hyper-permeability in TRALI model. We found that the expression of Slit2/Robo4 and VE-cadherin were significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner, whereas the PMVECs permeability was gradually increased over time in TRALI model. Moreover, the treatment with Slit2-N, an active fragment of Slit2, increased the expression of Slit2/Robo4 and VE-cadherin to protect PMVECs from PMN-mediated pulmonary endothelial hyper-permeability. These results indicate that targeting Slit2/Robo4 signaling pathway may modulate the permeability as well as protect the integrity of endothelial barrier. In addition, Slit2-N appears to be a promising candidate for developing novel therapies against TRALI.

Abstract: A novel multilayer nanostructured TiC–ZrB2/ZrB2/Al2O3 solar absorber coating has been developed for Concentrated Solar Power. The TiC–ZrB2 and ZrB2 work as the absorptance layers. The SS/TiC–ZrB2/ZrB2/Al2O3 solar absorber coatings exhibit a high spectral selectivity of 0.92/0.10. The sample is annealed in vacuum to test the thermal stability. After keeping the as-deposited samples and the samples annealed in vacuum at room temperature for two years, the coatings show different colors. Through the SEM, XPS and Raman analysis, we have discussed the corresponding failure mechanism. For the purpose of clarifying the failure mechanism more clearly, corresponding failure model is established.

Effects of sclerostin on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory phenotype in human odontoblasts and dental pulp cells,

Abstract: Previously we have demonstrated that sclerostin inhibits stress-induced odontogenic differentiation of odontoblasts and accelerates senescence of dental pulp cells (DPCs) Odontoblasts and DPCs are main functioning cells for inflammation resistance and tissue regeneration in dentine-pulp complex. Sclerostin is relevant for systemic inflammation and chronic periodontitis processes, but its effects on dental pulp inflammation remains unclear. In this study, we found that sclerostin expression of odontoblasts was elevated in lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory environment, and exogenous sclerostin increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in inflamed odontoblasts. Furthermore, sclerostin activated the NF-κB signaling pathway in inflamed odontoblasts and the NF-κB inhibitor reversed the exaggerative effects of sclerostin on the pro-inflammatory cytokines production. Additionally, sclerostin promoted adhesion and migration of inflamed DPCs, while inhibiting odontoblastic differentiation of inflamed DPCs. Sclerostin also might enhance pulpal angiogenesis. Taken together, it can therefore be inferred that sclerostin is upregulated in inflamed odontoblasts under pulpal inflammatory condition to enhance inflammatory responses in dentine-pulp complex and impair reparative dentinogenesis. This indicates that sclerostin inhibition might be a therapeutic target for anti-inflammation and pro-regeneration during dental pulp inflammation.

Abstract: Hyperlipidemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory disorders. Adenosine and adenosine deaminase (ADA) modulate immune responses and lipid metabolism. Curcumin and rutin are polyphenols with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic effects. We evaluated the action of rutin and curcumin in the lipid levels and inflammation, as well as their effect on ADA activity in serum, lymphocytes, platelets, and neutrophils of hyperlipidemic rats. Adult male Wistar rats pretreated with curcumin and/or rutin for 30 days were submitted to Poloxamer-407- induced hyperlipidemia. Biochemical, hematological, and oxidative stress parameters, as well as serum and extracellular ADA activity, were performed 36h post-induction. Hyperlipidemia was confirmed by the increase in total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG). Hematological alterations, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) and ADA activities were observed in hyperlipidemic rats. Curcumin and the curcumin/rutin association decreased TG and increased high-density lipids (HDL) levels. The pretreatments prevented changes in the hematological parameters, decreased the activities of MPO in plasma and ADA in serum and cells. Cholesterol and ROS levels were not altered by the pretreatments. Our results show that pretreatments with rutin and/or curcumin prevent the hyperlipidemia-induced inflammation. Pretreatments with curcumin and/or rutin are potential complementary therapies in the prevention of hypertriglyceridemia and inflammation.

Abstract: Background
Medical education has a major social impact because it ultimately influences the quality and safety of the health service offered to the population. Several studies have acknowledged the relationship between medical knowledge on transfusion medicine and the proper use of this therapy. The rational use of blood has become a worldwide concern. In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate medical residents’ knowledge on transfusion medicine in hospitals located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and their training during their medical education.
Methods
One hundred and six residents from eight medical specialties of four hospitals participated. A questionnaire developed by the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion (BEST) group was applied to evaluate the participants’ medical knowledge. Another questionnaire was also applied to evaluate participant profiles regarding frequency of transfusion prescriptions, self-perceived knowledge and relevance of the subject.
Results
The mean number of correct answers to the questionnaire on knowledge about transfusion practices was 43.5% (range: 15–80%). A relationship between training during medical residency and the obtained result was observed (p-value=0.0007). Most residents (73%) did not receive training in transfusion medicine during their graduation or residency and 93% would like to receive additional training.
Conclusion
A clear deficit in the knowledge of transfusion medicine was verified, indicating the need for change in the teaching of this specialty. This result is similar to some developed countries.

Abstract: The potential use of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in the study and treatment of hematological diseases requires the setup of efficient and safe protocols for hiPSC generation. We aimed to adopt a reprogramming method for large-scale production of integration-free patient-specific hiPSC-lines in our stem cell processing laboratory, which supports a pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant unit located at a tertiary care children's hospital. We describe our 5-year experience in generation of hiPSC-lines from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) using synthetic mRNAs encoding reprogramming factors. We generated hiPSC-lines from pediatric patients with β-Thalassemia, Sickle Cell Anemia, Blackfan-Diamond Anemia, Severe Aplastic Anemia, DOCK8 Immunodeficiency and 1 healthy control. After optimization of the reprogramming procedure, average reprogramming efficiency of BM-MSCs was 0.29% (range 0.25–0.4). The complete reprogramming process lasted 14–16 days. Three to five hiPSC-colonies per sample were selected, expanded to 5 culture passages and then frozen. The whole procedure took an average time of 1.8 months (range 1.6–2.2). The hiPSC-lines expressed embryonic stem cell markers and exhibited pluripotency. This mRNA reprogramming method can be applicable in a hematopoietic stem cell culture lab setting and would be useful for the clinical translation of patient-specific hiPSCs.

Abstract: While acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia in adulthood, the constellation of AML associated with central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is rare and typically occurs in patients with chromosome 3 or 7 abnormalities. This subgroup of AML is associated with a poor clinical outcome. In this report, we present a young woman with AML and concurrent CDI in the presence of inversion(3)(q21q26). The AML was refractory to the induction therapy “7 + 3”. Afterwards, the patient underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) and is still remaining in complete remission (CR) from AML as well as CDI 440 days after alloHSCT. Subsequently, in the largest study concerning patients with AML and CDI reported so far, we discuss additional cases from the literature. We demonstrated that patients with AML and CDI belong to the adverse prognostic group and clearly benefit from alloHSCT.

Abstract: Quercetin (Que), a widely distributed flavonoid in the human diet, exerts neuroprotective action because of its property to antagonize oxidative stress. Here, we investigated the effects of Que on lipid synthesis in C6 glioma cells. A rapid Que-induced inhibition of cholesterol and, to a lesser extent, of fatty acid synthesis from [1-14C]acetate was observed. The maximum decrease was detected at the level of palmitate, the end product of de novo fatty acid synthesis. The effect of Que on the enzyme activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), the two enzymes of this pathway, was investigated directly in situ in permeabilized C6 cells. An inhibitory effect on ACC1 was observed after 4 h of 25 μM Que treatment, while FAS activity was not affected. A reduction of polar lipid biosynthesis was also detected. A remarkable decrease of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) activity, regulatory enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, was evidenced. Expression studies demonstrated that Que acts at transcriptional level, by reducing the mRNA abundance and protein amount of ACC1 and HMGCR. Deepening the molecular mechanism, we found that Que decreased the expression of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, transcriptional factors representing the main regulators of de novo fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, respectively. Que also reduced the nuclear content of ChREBP, a glucose-induced transcription factor involved in the regulation of lipogenic genes. Our results represent the first evidence that a direct and rapid downregulatory effect of Que on cholesterol and de novo fatty acid synthesis is elicited in C6 cells.

Abstract: We analyzed the management and outcomes of pregnancies of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia at a single center over fifteen years. Among the 203 CML female patients, there were ten pregnancies in seven women, all of them not planned. In three cases, the chronic myeloid leukemia diagnosis was made during pregnancy. Five patients received tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the first weeks of pregnancy and the drug was interrupted until delivery. One patient lost complete cytogenetic response, and two patients lost the hematological response. A patient with a stable major molecular response had two successful pregnancies without loss of response. There were four premature births. There were no maternal adverse events, fetal malformation or death. All patients received Interferon-alpha during gestation, and two received hydroxyurea for a short period. Leukapheresis was performed in two patients for hyperleukocytosis control. One patient with sickle cell disease died from disease progression six months after delivery.
Conclusions
The tyrosine kinase inhibitors ministration should be interrupted during pregnancy. Patients should be advised to achieve a stable and deep molecular response if they plan to conceive, to avoid the risk of disease progression.

Abstract: Laser contact opening is a critical step for solar cells manufacturing and needs to be optimized to achieve high efficiencies. In this paper, laser contact opening using a picosecond laser (wavelength 355 nm, pulse duration 10 ps) has been carried out on n-PERT precursors composed of a SiOx/SiOxNy stack on the rear polished side and a SiOxNy layer on the front textured side. By varying peak fluence from 0.130 J/cm2 to 2.159 J/cm2 and spot overlapping, ninety parameters combinations have been tested to open these dielectric layers. Surface morphology characterization, before and after laser ablation, has been realized using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Bulk and surface compositions have also been investigated by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis, respectively. Results have shown the existence of four separated laser impacted areas on the polished side and a related ablation mechanism is suggested. Also, electrical characterization using four probe measurements and calibrated lifetime photoluminescence revealed that electrical properties of the silicon underlying increased when post laser annealing was performed associated with no spot overlapping. Then, nickel electroless deposition has been performed and first characterizations indicate adherence issues and inhomogeneous metallization. Characterization of metallized samples revealed that these observations were closely linked to the non-homogenous surface morphology and composition after laser ablation.

Abstract: Differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells into macrophages is accompanied by increased PU.1 concentration and increasing cell cycle length, culminating in cell cycle arrest. Induction of PU.1 expression in a cultured myeloid cell line expressing low PU.1 concentration results in decreased levels of mRNA encoding ATP-Citrate Lyase (ACL) and cell cycle arrest. ACL is an essential enzyme for generating acetyl-CoA, a key metabolite for the first step in fatty acid synthesis and for histone acetylation. We hypothesized that ACL may play a role in cell cycle regulation in the myeloid lineage. In this study, we found that acetyl-CoA or acetate supplementation was sufficient to rescue cell cycle progression in cultured BN cells treated with an ACL inhibitor or induced for PU.1 expression. Acetyl-CoA supplementation was also sufficient to rescue cell cycle progression in BN cells treated with a fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor. We demonstrated that acetyl-CoA was utilized in both fatty acid synthesis and histone acetylation pathways to promote proliferation. Finally, we found that Acly mRNA transcript levels decrease during normal macrophage differentiation from bone marrow precursors. Our results suggest that regulation of ACL activity is a potentially important point of control for cell cycle regulation in the myeloid lineage.

Abstract: Interleukin-17F rs763780 (7488A/G) gene polymorphism obviously affecting the expression and activity of IL17F and may affect primary immune thrombocytopenia (PIT) susceptibility and its clinical features in Egyptian children and adults. 105 ITP patients divided into (63 pediatric and 42 adult patient) and 112 age and sex matched healthy controls were enrolled in this case control study. All patients were subjected to history taking; clinical examination, CBC, bone marrow aspiration and genotyping of IL17F rs763780 polymorphism by (PCR-RFLP) technique. Our results revealed significant decrease in the mutant heterozygous genotype AG and also in IL-17F mutant allele G frequency in ITP patient group and associated with increased risk for ITP compared with the control group (P = 0.04 and P = 0.005 respectively). Furthermore, the mutant allele G frequency was significantly decreased in childhood onset than adult onset ITP (OR = 0.31, P = 0.02) and also was significantly lower in chronic ITP when compared with newly diagnosed and persistent ITP (P = 0.005). Patients with the AA genotype showed severe thrombocytopenic state at diagnosis than those with the AG genotype (P = 0.04). We concluded from our results that interleukin-17F rs763780 (7488A/G) polymorphism is strongly correlated with susceptibility and severity of ITP.

Abstract: Purpose
The present study aimed to identify the molecular mechanism of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and explore valuable prognostic biomarkers for relapsed ALL.
Methods
Gene expression dataset including 59 samples from ALL survivals without recurrence (good group) and 114 samples from dead ALL patients died of recurrence (poor group) was downloaded from TCGA database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between good and poor groups, followed by pathway and functional enrichment analyses. Subsequently, logistic regression model and survival analysis were performed.
Results
In total, 637 up- and 578 down-regulated DEGs were revealed between good and poor groups. These DEGs were mainly enriched in functions including transcription and pathways like focal adhesion. Genes including alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1), zinc finger protein 695 (ZNF695), actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4), calreticulin (CALR), and F-Box and leucine rich repeat protein 5 (FBXL5) were outstanding in survival analysis.
Conclusion
Transcription and focal adhesion might play important roles in ALL progression. Furthermore, genes including ALPK1, ZNF695, ACTN4, CALR, and FBXL5 might be novel prognostic genes for relapsed ALL.

Abstract: Background
Scurvy is a rare entity in developed countries and the diagnosis may often be delayed resulting in unnecessary investigations and/or potentially severe complications. A recent increase in the number of patients diagnosed with scurvy in our hematology clinics indicated the need to review the literature on the diagnosis and optimal management of similar patients.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients referred to hematology at our tertiary care centre between 2010 and 2018, who were ultimately diagnosed with scurvy. Data collected from electronic medical records included baseline characteristics, clinical features on presentation, bloodwork results from initial consultation, treatment plan as well as response to treatment.
Findings
Twenty-two adults patient had a diagnosis of scurvy with a mean vitamin C level of 6 μmol/L. Iron deficiency anemia (54%) and gastrointestinal disorders (54%) were the most common comorbidities noted in our cohort. Proton-pump inhibitors use was noted in 54% of patients. Bleeding (45%) and bruising (45%) were the most commonly reported clinical features. Eleven patients received oral supplementation, five had intravenous (IV) vitamin C and six were not treated. Two patients required a transition from oral to IV supplementation. Vitamin C dosing ranged between 250 and 2000 mg and the frequency varied from daily for oral therapy to every few weeks or months for IV.
Interpretation
Awareness of scurvy and its associated risk factors and clinical presentation is important in the evaluation of a patient with bleeding tendency. Treatment plan should be individualized, and a careful review of patients' diet, medial history and medications is warranted.

Abstract: Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) plays an important role in the progression of cardiac fibrosis but its mechanism and treatment need to be further understood. Herein, we have found that mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) played a critical role in transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1)-induced EndMT in endothelial cells (ECs). MtUPR was repressed in endothelial cells after exposure to TGF-β1. NAD + precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) could attenuate TGF-β1-induced EndMT and improve the levels of mtUPR. Significantly, prohibitin proteins (PHB and PHB2) was also regulated by nicotinamide riboside. Moreover, we found that inhibition of prohibitin proteins could prevent the protective effect of nicotinamide riboside on mtUPR and TGF-β1-induced EndMT. Overexpression of prohibitin proteins could alleviate mitochondrial function and TGF-β1-induced EndMT through improving mtUPR. In vivo, The EndMT of ECs induced by Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mouse was inhibited by NR. In conclusion, our results indicate that nicotinamide riboside improved the expression of prohibitin proteins to ameliorate EndMT via promotion of mtUPR. Nicotinamide riboside is a potential therapeutic target for cardiac fibrosis.

Abstract: Background
Ehrlichiosis is an acute febrile tick-borne disease which can rarely be a trigger for secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).
Methods
We reviewed our experience with Ehrlichia infections at a tertiary-care academic medical center.
Results
Over 10 years, 157 cases of ehrlichiosis were identified. Ten patients (6.4%) had infection with E. ewingii, 7(4.5%) of whom were transplant patients as compared to 3(1.9%) non-transplant patients (p = .035). Transplant patients were more likely to have leukopenia and elevated creatinine compared to immunocompetent patients; length of hospital stay and early mortality were not different between the two groups. Ten patients met the HLH-2004 diagnosis criteria, which could be an underestimation of HLH occurrence as most patients were not completely evaluated for these criteria. We calculated the H-Score to find the probability of HLH; 25 patients scored high making the occurrence rate of HLH at least 16%. Ehrlichia-induced HLH patients (N = 25) had more anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine and AST. Moreover, they had a significantly longer hospital stay (median 9 days) compared to patients without HLH (median 4 days) (p = .006).
Conclusions
Ehrlichia-induced HLH is a potential serious complication with relatively high occurrence rate; patients manifest severe disease with end-organ damage requiring longer hospital stay.

Abstract: Objectives and methods
We evaluated possible relationships between echocardiographic findings and clinical and laboratory parameters, in a cohort of Brazilian patients diagnosed with sickle cell/β-thalassemia, to better understand the cardiac involvement in this disease.
Results
Left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) dilation were found in 19.5 and 11% of patients, respectively; systolic left ventricular dysfunction was present in a single patient. There were no differences in masses and volumes of cardiac chambers comparing Sβ0 with Sβ+ patients, and no relationship between these parameters and specific complications of the disease. However, parameters of altered ventricular geometry were significantly correlated with serum creatinine, hepatic transaminases and bilirubin levels. Moreover, 3 patients presented stroke; they were significantly older [53 (41–56)×37.5 (18–70), p=0.048], had higher values of LV posterior wall diastolic thickness [10 (10–11)×8 (6–14), p=0.03], LV mass [226 (194–260)×147 (69–537), p=0.039] and LA/aortic ratio [1.545 (1.48–1.61)×1.26 (0.9–1.48), p=0.032].
Conclusions
Cardiac involvement in this disease does not appear to depend on the thalassemia phenotype. The presence of signs of myocardial remodeling in this group of patients was related to multi-organ impairment and rendered a higher propensity for stroke in older patients, suggesting the need for greater vigilance and control of associated factors.

Abstract: In hereditary hemochromatosis, iron overload is associated with homozygosity for the p.C282Y mutation. A second mutation, p.H63D, occurs at significant frequencies in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Early studies in Sri Lanka indicated that the variant had arisen independently, suggesting that it had been the subject of selective pressure. However, its role in iron absorption is unclear. In a survey of 7526 Sri Lankan secondary school students, we determined hemoglobin genotype and measured red cell indices, serum ferritin, transferrin receptor, iron zinc protoporphyrin and hepcidin. These variables were compared according to the presence or absence of the p.H63D variant in a subset of 1313 students for whom DNA samples were available. Students were classified as having low red cell indices if they had an MCV <80 fl and/or MCH <27 pg. Hetero and/or homozygosity for the p.H63D variant was more common in students with normal than low red cell indices (16.4% and 11.9% respectively; p = 0.019). Iron biomarkers and red cell indices were greater in children with the p.H63D variant than in normal and this was statistically significant for MCV (p = 0.046). Our findings suggest that selective pressure by mild iron deficiency contributes to the high frequencies of the p.H63D variant.

Abstract: Background
Alloimmunization is a major problem in transfusion practice due to the clinical complications of the patients and the difficulty of choosing a unit of compatible blood product. Serological methods are widely used in blood banks, but they not always determine the phenotype. Thus, genotyping is an important complement to the serology tool as it allows one to predict the phenotype from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with high accuracy.
Objective
To compare the centrifugation gel, microarray, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphismone PCR (PCR-RFLP) and Sequence-Specific Primer PCR (PCR-SSP) techniques, in terms of cost, reaction time and reliability of the results.
Methods
The RHCE, Kidd, Kell and Duffy blood group systems were chosen to determine the approximate cost of each technique, considering the reagents used in both methods and considering only one sample. The time required for the development of each reaction was obtained at the Maringa Regional Blood Center and Immunogenetics Laboratory at the State University of Maringa. Data from Microarray reactions were obtained at the Campinas Blood Center. The results of phenotyping and genotyping of the 16 samples were compiled in a spreadsheet and compared.
Results
The PCR-SSP was more economical compared to other methods, and the serological method was faster than the molecular methods. However, all methods proved to be effective and safe in the detection of erythrocyte antigens.
Conclusion
Analyzing the advantages and limitations of the molecular and serological methods tested in this study, we note that both are important and complementary. However, the choice of a methodology depends on the reality and needs of each health service.

Abstract: Background
ABO blood group incompatibility between donor and recipient is associated with a number of immunohematological complications, but is not considered a major contraindication to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, available evidence from the literature seems to be conflicting as to the impact of incompatibility on overall survival, event-free survival, transplant-related mortality, graft-versus-host disease, and time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment.
Methods
This single-center, prospective, cohort study included patients with hematological malignancies who underwent a first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between 2008 and 2014. Patients receiving umbilical cord blood as the stem cell source were excluded from this analysis. The impact of ABO incompatibility was evaluated in respect to overall survival, event-free survival, transplant-related mortality, acute graft-versus-host disease and engraftment.
Results
A total of 130 patients were included of whom 78 (60%) were males. The median age at transplant was 36 (range: 2–65) years, 44 (33%) presented ABO incompatibility, 75 (58%) had acute leukemia, 111 (85%) had a related donor, 100 (77%) received peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells as graft source and 99 (76%) underwent a myeloablative conditioning regimen. There was no statistically significant association between ABO incompatibility and overall survival, event-free survival, transplant-related mortality, grade II–IV acute graft-versus-host disease, neutrophil or platelet engraftment in multivariate analysis.
Conclusion
These results show that ABO incompatibility does not seem to influence these parameters in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Abstract: Utilisation of expensive silicon (Si) material in crystalline Si modules has come down to 4 g Si per watt-peak in 2018, mainly as a result of reduction in wafer thickness and kerf losses as well as increase in module efficiencies. With continued progress in conventional multi-wire sawing of ingots, wafers as thin as 100 μm could eventually be produced. Beyond this, kerfless lift-off technologies are being investigated which enable wafer thicknesses well below 100 μm with negligible Si kerf waste. Such thin Si wafers and foils would be much lighter in weight than today's standard 165-180 μm-thick wafers and would exhibit considerable flexibility and fragility. This necessitates a rethink about how to handle and process thin Si into solar devices in a manufacturing line with high mechanical yield and high throughput. This paper gives a broad overview of the different approaches for fabricating solar cells on thin Si foils. In particular, three routes are discussed in detail, namely (1) freestanding processing of thin Si, (2) processing of thin Si supported mechanically on a conductive low-cost Si substrate (“wafer-equivalent” approach) and (3) processing of thin Si bonded to a transparent glass superstrate. In each case, the main challenges are explained and the recent progress in addressing them are summarised. Kerfless 50 μm-thick epitaxial Si foils lifted-off using porous Si and thinned-down Si wafers (below 70 μm) are used as model substrates for this work.

Abstract: The impact of constitutional supercooling (CS) on the grain structure of cast multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) materials was investigated. Indium impurity was chosen as the CS dopant because of its low equilibrium segregation coefficient so that CS effect could be obtained at relatively low doping concentration. Industrial indium (In) doped G2 and boron-indium (B–In) co-doped G5 seed-assisted multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) ingots were fabricated and characterized. Self-nucleated grains and epitaxial grains could be obtained, respectively, as the result of tuning the doping amount of indium. Constitutional-supercooling-related defects (CSD) were found in the co-doped ingot and could suppress the growth and propagation of dislocation-type defects. As a result, the overall deleterious defect density of B–In co-doped mc-Si wafers was well reduced compared to that of referential B-doped wafers, and the average solar cell performance of B–In co-doped ingots was obviously enhanced.

Abstract: The human deubiquitinases USP12 and USP46 are very closely related paralogs with critical functions as tumor suppressors. The catalytic activity of these enzymes is regulated by two cofactors: UAF1 and WDR20. USP12 and USP46 show nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity and share some cellular activities, but have also evolved non-overlapping functions. We hypothesized that, correlating with their functional divergence, the subcellular localization of USP12 and USP46 might be differentially regulated by their cofactors. We used confocal and live microscopy analyses of epitope-tagged proteins to determine the effect of UAF1 and WDR20 on the localization of USP12 and USP46. We found that WDR20 differently modulated the localization of the DUBs, promoting recruitment of USP12, but not USP46, to the plasma membrane. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated a large set of USP12 and WDR20 mutants to characterize in detail the mechanisms and sequence determinants that modulate the subcellular localization of the USP12/UAF1/WDR20 complex. Our data suggest that the USP12/UAF1/WDR20 complex dynamically shuttles between the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus. This shuttling involved active nuclear export mediated by the CRM1 pathway, and required a short N-terminal motif (1MEIL4) in USP12, as well as a novel nuclear export sequence (450MDGAIASGVSKFATLSLHD468) in WDR20. In conclusion, USP12 and USP46 have evolved divergently in terms of cofactor binding-regulated subcellular localization. WDR20 plays a crucial role in as a “targeting subunit” that modulates CRM1-dependent shuttling of the USP12/UAF1/WDR20 complex between the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus.

Abstract: Juvenile hemochromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive disease due to variants in the Hemojuvelin (HJV) gene. Although biological features mimic HFE hemochromatosis, clinical presentation is worst with massive iron overload diagnosed during childhood. Our study describes clinical features and results of genetic testing for a group of patients initially referred for a hepcidino-deficiency syndrome and for whom HJV hemochromatosis was finally diagnosed. 662 patients with iron overload and high serum transferrin saturation were tested, and five genes (HFE, HJV, HAMP, TFR2, SLC40A1) were sequenced. Among our cohort, ten unrelated patients were diagnosed with HJV hemochromatosis. Genetic testing revealed five previously published and five undescribed variants: p.Arg41Pro, p.His180Arg, p.Lys299Glu, p.Cys361Arg and p.Ala384Val. Surprisingly, this study revealed a late age of onset in some patients, contrasting with the commonly accepted definition of “juvenile” hemochromatosis. Five of our patients were 30 years old or older, including two very late discoveries. Biological features and severity of iron overload were similar in younger and older patients. Our study brings new insight on HJV hemochromatosis showing that mild phenotype and late onset are possible. Genetic testing for HJV variants should thus be performed for all patients displaying a non-p.Cys282Tyr homozygous HFE hemochromatosis with hepcidin deficiency phenotype.

Abstract: Primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL) are rare and poor prognosis diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Because of the brain tumor environment and the restricted distribution of drugs in the CNS, specific PCNSL patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) models are needed for preclinical research to improve the prognosis of PCNSL patients. PCNSL patient specimens (n = 6) were grafted in the caudate nucleus of immunodeficient nude mice with a 83% rate of success, while subcutaneous implantation in nude mice of human PCNSL sample did not generate lymphoma, supporting the role of the brain microenvironment in the PCNSL physiopathology. PDOXs showed diffuse infiltration of B-cell lymphoma cells in the brain parenchyma. Each model had a unique mutational signature for genes in the BCR and NF-κB pathways and retained the mutational profile of the primary tumor. The models can be stored as cryopreserved biobank. Human IL-10 levels measured in the plasma of PCNSL-PDOX mice showed to be a reliable tool to monitor the tumor burden. Treatment response could be measured after a short treatment with the targeted therapy ibrutinib. In summary, we established a panel of human PCNSL-PDOX models that capture the histological and molecular characteristics of the disease and that proved suitable for preclinical experiments. Our methods of generation and characterization will enable the generation of additional PDOX-PCNSL models, essential tools for cognitive and preclinical drug discovery.

Overexpression of Toll-like receptor 4 enhances LPS-induced inflammatory response and inhibits Salmonella Typhimurium growth in ovine macrophages,

Abstract: The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a crucial role in innate inflammatory responses, as it recognizes gram-negative bacteria (or their products) and contributes greatly to host defense against invading pathogens. Though TLR4 overexpressing transgenic sheep, resistant to certain diseases related with gram-negative bacteria, had been bred in our previous research, the effects of overexpression of TLR4 on innate immune response remained unclear. In this study, TLR4 overexpressing ovine macrophages were obtained from peripheral blood, and it was found that the overexpression of TLR4 initially promoted the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 by activating TLR4-mediated IRAK4-dependent NF-κB and MAPK (JNK and ERK1/2) signaling following LPS stimulation. However, this effect was later impaired due to increased internalization of TLR4 into endosomal compartment of the macrophages. Then the overexpression of TLR4 triggered TBK1-dependent interferon-regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) expression, which in turn led to the induction of IFN-β and IFN-inducible genes (i.e.IP10, IRG1 and GARG16). Understandably, an increased IFN-β level facilitated phosphorylation of STAT1 to induce expression of innate antiviral genes Mx1 and ISG15, suggesting that TLR4 overexpressing macrophages were equipped better against viral infection. Correspondingly, the bacterial burden in these macrophages, after infection with live S. Typhimurium, was decreased significantly. In summary, the results indicated that overexpression of TLR4 could enhance innate inflammatory responses, initiate the innate antiviral immunity, and control effectively S. Typhimurium growth in ovine macrophages.

Abstract: Beta thalassemia major (β-TM) displays a great deal of phenotypic heterogeneity, not fully investigated in terms of cause-effect. We aimed to detect if different genotypic groups could be related to different levels of cardiac impairment, evaluated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). We considered 671 β-TM patients (age 30.1 years, 52.9% females) consecutively enrolled in the Myocardial Iron Overload (MIO) in Thalassemia network. MIO was assessed by T2* technique. Biventricular function was quantified by cine images. Myocardial fibrosis was evaluated by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) technique. Three groups of patients were identified: heterozygotes β+/β° (N = 279), homozygotes β + (N = 154), homozygotes β° (N = 238). Transfusional needs resulted significantly lower in homozygous β + TM patients when compared to the other groups. The homozygous β + group versus the heterozygous and homozygous β° groups showed higher global heart T2* values (P < 0.0001) and a lower number of patients with a global heart T2* value<20 ms (P < 0.001). The homozygotes β + showed a lower number of patients with a pathological left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than the other two groups (P < 0.05). The β+/β + TM patients showed less MIO and a concordant better systolic heart function. These data support the knowledge of different genotypic groups in the management of β-TM patients.

Abstract: Diazepam is a medicament of the benzodiazepine family and it typically produces a sedative effect. Researchers have revealed that diazepam can induce melanogenesis and produce dendrite-like structures in B16 melanoma cells. However, the associated mechanisms of melanogenesis and phenotypic alterations have mostly remained unknown. In this study, we determined the effects of diazepam on melanogenesis, cellular phenotypic alterations, the location of melanosomes and the expression of relevant proteins in melanocytes using Masson–Fontana ammoniacal silver staining, scanning electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis. Our results collectively indicated that diazepam had a pivotal role in melanocytes by enhancing melanin synthesis, melanocyte dendricity, melanosome trafficking, and capture at the dendrite tips. These functions might be attributed to the fact that diazepam activated the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). This increased intracellular levels of cAMP, which stimulated the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding (CREB). As a result, this increased the tyrosinase, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), Rab27a, Myosin Va, Rab17 and Cdc42 expression. This caused melanogenesis and melanosome transport. Therefore, our findings may provide a potential strategy for treating anti-hypopigmentation disorders.

Abstract: Solar water purification (SWP) has been considered as one of the most sustainable techniques to address clean water shortage problem. Although significant strategies have been proposed to explore portable SWP device, many challenges, such as complicated fabrication, high costs and poor practicability, still remain to be solved. Here, a facilely and integrally designed Bi2S3/poly (vinylidene fluoride) (BP) composites based on polyurethane (PU) Sponges (PBP composites) is reported. The PBP composites consist of integrated structures, in which multiple internal reflections guarantee sufficient harvest of incident light and tip thermal effects of chrysanthemum-like Bi2S3 ensure efficient solar thermal conversion, and porous BP endows it with adequate water supply, thus exhibiting a high water evaporation rate of 1.66 kg m−2 h−1 and a solar thermal efficiency of 92.9% under one sun irradiation. This bionic optical design and heat management design may provide a new inspiration to utilize solar energy in water purification and other related applications.

Abstract: Objective
To assess the impact of the distance education course “Sickle Cell Disease: Primary Health Care Line” on knowledge acquisition of professional healthcare providers.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted with a quantitative approach at the Educational and Support Center for Hemoglobinopathies (Cehmob-MG), state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 2016. One hundred and fifty-three out of 300 professional healthcare providers were invited to participate in the proposed distance course. Of the participating professional healthcare providers, 72 (47%) successfully concluded the course (Group A), whereas 81 (53%) did not complete their course assignments and did not meet the minimum requirements for regular attendance (Group B). Knowledge acquisition was assessed with the Knowledge of Sickle Cell Disease Instrument, DFConhecimento, applied using the web tool eSurv. Univariate analysis by Poisson regression was employed to assess the influence of sociodemographic variables on the DFConhecimento score and to select variables to compose the initial multivariate regression model (p-value<0.20). The analysis was performed in the statistical programming environment R.
Results
The average score was 9.76 for Group A and 6.54 for Group B. The two groups were considered statistically different (p-value<0.05) for all items with the proportion of correct items being greater in Group A. Professional healthcare providers who concluded the course had a significantly higher DFConhecimento score (45%) when compared to those who did not successfully conclude the course.
Conclusion
Participation in a distance education course on sickle cell disease had a positive impact on the acquisition of knowledge about the disease by professional healthcare providers.

Abstract: Molten chloride salts have recently gained attention for application to heat transfer and thermal energy storage in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. In this study, we studied the electrochemical effect of addition of hydroxide ions and/or dissolved metals added to MgCl2–KCl–NaCl salt mixture. Open circuit potentiometry indicated that the salt's redox potential increased with addition of hydroxide ions and decreased with the addition of soluble magnesium metal. Cyclic voltammetry indicated that a reduction peak associated with hydroxides vanished with addition of Mg0. Hydrogen gas was evolved when a mixture of Mg metal and MgCl2–KCl–NaCl containing NaOH was heated to 650 °C. These results demonstrate the benefit and mechanism for redox potential control in this salt using dissolved Mg metal.

Abstract: Predictive biomarkers for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is currently lacking. In this study, we employed an unbiased proteome profiling method to prospectively collected plasma samples from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) recipients to identify protein biomarkers that predict the risk of aGVHD and non-relapse mortality (NRM). In the discovery set, including five aGVHD patients and five controls, we identified seven candidate proteins. Patients with high levels of these proteins tended to exhibit a higher risk of aGVHD and NRM compared to patients with low levels in post-engraftment plasma samples from an independent validation set (n = 89). Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, plastin-2, and regenerating islet-derived protein 3-α were selected as the most-predictive biomarkers via an exhaustive variable screening algorithm and were collectively used to develop a biomarker panel score ranging from 0 to 3. The biomarker panel score correlated significantly with aGVHD and NRM risk in univariable and multivariable Cox models. Furthermore, using the biomarker panel score in conjunction with clinical predictors significantly improved the discriminatory performance of the Cox model in predicting aGVHD and NRM risk. Our findings suggest that plasma-derived protein biomarkers can be used to predict aGVHD and NRM before the onset of clinical manifestations.

Abstract: Background
Mesenchymal stem cells have immense potential in stem cell-based therapies, however there is a pre-requisite to develop a curative cell dose. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells are promising mainly due to their potential abundance, immunomodulatory effect and remarkable differentiation potential. Nevertheless, senescence may develop during their in vitro expansion due to the incidence of genetic instability. Hence, it is important to attain an ideal balance between mesenchymal stem cell growth, quality and genetic integrity before their clinical use.
Methods
Stromal vascular fraction was obtained from omentum tissue of patients undergoing liposuction procedures for morbid obesity. This study standardized a closed system protocol which can be utilized for clinical grade stem cell derivation. Stages of cell growth and characterization of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells were also assessed along with the chromosomal stability in these in vitro cultures.
Results
Human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells maintained their spindle-shaped morphology and were able to proliferate and renew, confirming their suitability for in vitro cultivation and generate clinical grade mesenchymal stem cells. Immunophenotyping indicates that the cells expressed cluster of differentiation (CD)73/CD90/CD105, mesenchymal stem-cell markers, while lacked CD34/CD45/ Human Leukocyte antigen-antigen D related (HLA-DR) expression (hematopoietic cell markers). A cell cycle study demonstrated growth kinetics under in vitro culture conditions. Human adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells expressed normal cell karyotype by chromosomal G-banding indicating their genetic stability at Passage 5. Mesenchymal stem cells also demonstrated trilineage differentiation.
Conclusions
Availability of adipose tissue in abundance is a major advantage for clinical applications. Furthermore, detailed characterization of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells, their genomic stability and differentiation potential from stromal vascular fraction of human adipose tissue would help assist in tissue regeneration and repair.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults, which is aggressive cancer. CircRNAs are abundantly expressed in the hematologic malignancy cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression profiling of circRNAs in AML. We performed circRNA-sequencing to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in bone marrow samples from AML patients and iron-deficiency anemia (control). Furthermore, we found that circ_0009910 was significantly upregulated in AML patients compared with iron-deficiency anemia patients. High circ_0009910 expression predicted a poor risk and outcome of AML patients. Further experiments in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that knockdown of circ_0009910 inhibited AML cell proliferation and induced apoptosis through sponging miR-20a-5p. Our findings firstly identify that circ_0009910 is significantly upregulated in AML bone marrow samples and might serve as a novel outcome biomarker for AML. Both circ_0009910 and miR-20a-5p may be potential therapeutic targets for future AML treatment.

Abstract: To study the association between TET2rs2454206, TET2rs12498609 and ASXL1rs3746609 and Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a total of 90 MDS patients and 143 healthy volunteers were included. The clinical data, bone marrow samples of patients and peripheral blood samples of volunteers were obtained. We found TET2rs2454206 G/A genotype, TET2rs12498609 G/C genotype and ASXL1rs3746609 A/G genotype in 13.3%, 11.1%, 10.1% MDS patients and in 42.7%, 22.4%, 23.8% healthy volunteers (P < 0.001; P = 0.029; P = 0.009, respectively). TET2 rs2454206 G/A genotype was associated with higher serum LDH level in MDS (P = 0.025). Patients with TET2rs12498609 G/C genotype were characterized with higher frequency of mutated SRSF2 gene (P = 0.042) and lower occurrence rate of anemia (P = 0.026) than those with C/C genotype. ASXL1rs3746609 A/G genotype linked with higher thrombocyte counts (P = 0.02) and percent of total T lymphocyte (P = 0.029), whereas with lower percent of NK cell (P = 0.032) and B lymphocyte (P = 0.007). None of these three SNPs had impact on the overall survival and disease progression to AML. We concluded that People with TET rs2454206 G/A genotype, TET2rs12498609 G/C genotype or ASXL1rs3746609 A/G genotype were related to lower prevalence of MDS. All of the three SNPs were associated with certain laboratory features in MDS patients.

Abstract: The porous silicon (PSI) process is a wafering method to fabricate high quality kerfless crystalline Si wafers by epitaxial wafer growth on porous Si and subsequent detachment from a reusable substrate wafer. The process yield is a key parameter for the economic viability of the PSI process. We experimentally demonstrate the detachment of 59 out of 62 PSI wafers with a size of 10 × 10 cm2, and separation layer etch current densities of 105–120 mA/cm2 for electrochemically etching the porous Si, and for substrate wafers with a resistivity of 15.7–16.9 mΩcm. We discuss the statistics of how to deduce a detachment probability from this. From our experiments, we determine a detachment yield of at least 88% with an error probability of 5%. The demonstration of a 99% detachment yield with an error probability of 5% would require at least 300 successfully detached wafers with no failed detachment. Samples have a minority carrier density ranging from 1 to 1.7 ms before any external gettering, which demonstrates the high electric quality of the PSI wafers.

Abstract: Background
There has been a revolution in the treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia since imatinib's introduction. However, patient adherence has a great impact on the response obtained with medical treatment. This study's objective was to analyze the drug adherence and the factors that influenced it in patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in a referral hospital in the Brazilian Amazon.
Method
This was a retrospective study including 120 patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia from January 2002 to December 2014. The adherence was estimated by the Proportion of Days Covered and the persistence by Kaplan–Meier analysis. The data was analyzed in Epi Info 7® software and the relationship between the variables was analyzed by Fisher's exact test. A p-value lower than 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Twenty-seven patients (22.5%) were considered non-adherent. There has been irregular medication use and disinterest in the treatment in 20.83% (n=25), of which 13 were considered non-adherent (p<0.001). A total of 26.67% (n=32) abandoned the treatment for a period. Of those, 56.25% (n=18) were non-adherent (p<0.001). Distance to the hospital, lack of medication and side-effects were all non-significant to low adherence. At the end of a 360-day follow-up, 44.16% (n=53) of patients presented a break in persistence, whose average was 255 days.
Conclusion
The adherence found in this study was similar to that found in others of its kind. The only factors that negatively influenced the adherence were disinterest and abandonment of treatment, which can reflect the need to individually educate Chronic Myeloid Leukemia patients.

Abstract: Introduction
Identification of beta-thalassemia carrier in prenatal screening relies on the elevated Hb A2 level. Borderline Hb A2 levels pose a diagnostic challenge. We determined the HBB genotypes in subjects with borderline Hb A2 in northern Thailand and studied the effects of coinherited alpha0-thalassemia on Hb A2 levels.
Methods
Blood samples with Hb A2 3.1–10.0% from 2193 samples submitted for prenatal thalassemia screening were selected. Information on HBB genotypes and coinherited alpha0-thalassemia were collected. All samples with unknown HBB genotypes underwent an automated DNA sequencing. The Hb A2 levels were compared according to the coinherited alpha0-thalassemia.
Results
HBB mutations were found in 298 (98.7%) of 302 samples with Hb A2 4.0–10.0%. In the 106 samples with Hb A2 3.1–3.9%, six had HBB mutations; four Hb Dhonburi [codon 126 (T > G)], one CAP site mutation [CAP + 1 (A > C)] and one beta0-thalassemia [codon 41/42 (-TTCT)] with a coinherited HBD mutation [nt-77 (T > C)]. The Hb A2 levels in beta-thalassemia carriers with and without coinherited alpha0-thalassemia were not significantly different.
Conclusions
HBB mutations in northern Thais with borderline Hb A2 levels comprise an unstable variant Hb Dhonburi and CAP + 1 (A > C) mutation. Coinherited HBD mutation lowers Hb A2 and can cause a misidentification of a beta-thalassemia carrier.

Abstract: In Parkinson's disease (PD), as in many other neurodegenerative disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein misfolding, and proteotoxic stress underly the disease process. For decades, the primary symptomatic treatment for PD has been the dopamine precursor L-DOPA (Levodopa). L-DOPA however can initiate protein misfolding through its ability to mimic the protein amino acid L-tyrosine, resulting in random errors in aminoacylation and L-DOPA becoming mistakenly inserted into the polypeptide chain of proteins in place of L-tyrosine. In the present study we examined the impact that the generation of DOPA-containing proteins had on human neuroblastoma cell (SH-SY5Y) function in vitro. We showed that even in the presence of antioxidants there was a significant accumulation of cytosolic ubiquitin in DOPA-treated cells, an upregulation in the endosomal-lysosomal degradation system, deleterious changes to mitochondrial morphology and a marked decline in mitochondrial function.The effects of L-DOPA on mitochondrial function were not observed with D-DOPA, the stereoisomer of L-DOPA that cannot be inserted into proteins so did not result from oxidative stress. We could fully protect against these effects by co-treatment with L-tyrosine, supporting the view that misincorporation of L-DOPA into proteins contributed to these cytotoxic effects, leading us to suggest that co-treatment with L-tyrosine could be beneficial therapeutically.

Abstract: Few case series of pagophagia and iron deficiency include men. We performed a retrospective study of non-Hispanic white men with iron-deficiency anemia whose anemia and pagophagia, thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia (if present) resolved after iron replacement. Iron-deficiency anemia was defined as transferrin saturation (TS) <15%, serum ferritin (SF) <30 μg/L, and hemoglobin (Hb) <13.0 g/dL. We excluded men with: anemia, thrombocytosis, or thrombocytopenia due to non-iron-deficiency causes; malignancy; chronic inflammatory conditions; hemochromatosis; or creatinine >1.1 mg/dL. We computed univariate and multivariable pagophagia associations with: age; gastrointestinal bleeding; TS; SF; Hb; red blood cell (RBC) count; mean corpuscular volume (MCV); RBC distribution width (RDW); and platelet count. Median age of 41 men was 54 y (range 18–81). Fourteen men (34.1%) had pagophagia. Thirty-six men (87.8%) had gastrointestinal bleeding. Mean Hb was 9.4 ± 2.2 g/dL. Six men (14.6%) had thrombocytosis; two (4.9%) had thrombocytopenia. Logistic regression on pagophagia revealed: age (p = 0.0158; odds ratio 0.92 [95% confidence interval: 0.85, 0.99]) and platelet count (p = 0.0187; 0.98 [0.97, 1.00]) (41.4% of pagophagia occurrence; ANOVA p = 0.0053). We conclude that pagophagia occurred in 34% of men with iron-deficiency anemia and was negatively associated with age and platelet count, after adjustment for other variables.

Abstract: Background
Test-seeking is associated with HIV in Brazilian blood donors. This study sought to investigate the frequency with which three different donor groups: deferred donors, accepted donors who tested HIV positive [HIV (+)], and accepted donors who tested infectious disease markers negative [IDM (−)], came to the blood bank at the suggestion of a health care professional.
Study design and methods
Donors deferred for reporting high-risk behaviors and participants in an HIV risk factor case-control study completed a confidential audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) that included two questions related to health care professionals and test-seeking.
Results
Of 4013 enrolled deferred donors, 468 (11.8%) reported a health care professional suggested donation as a way to be tested for infection. Of 341 HIV (+) and 791 IDM (−) participants, 43 (12.6%) and 11 (1.4%), respectively, reported a health care professional suggested donation as a way to be tested for infection. Physicians were the most frequently reported source of referral: [(61.5% of deferred, 69.1% of HIV (+), and 9.1% of IDM (−) donors)].
Conclusion
HIV (+) donors and deferred donors were 10 times more likely to report test-seeking behavior by suggestion of health care professional than IDM (−) donors. If true, efforts should be made to educate health care professionals and blood donors on how to safeguard the blood supply, emphasizing that HIV testing should be done at volunteer testing centers rather than at the blood centers.

Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide as the third endogenous gaseous mediator had protective effects against traumatic brain injury-induced neuronal damage in mice. However, the exact pathophysiological mechanism underlying traumatic brain injury is complicated and the protective role of H2S is not yet fully known. Therefore, we combined the mechanical injury (scratch) with secondary injury including metabolic impairment (no glucose) together to investigate the underlying cellular mechanism of hydrogen sulfide in vitro models of traumatic brain injury. In the present study, we found that H2S could prevent the scratch-induced decrease in the expression of cystathionine-β-synthetase, a key enzyme involved in the source of hydrogen sulfide, and endogenous hydrogen sulfide generation in PC12 cells. We also found that hydrogen sulfide could prevent scratch-induced cellular injury, alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species and cell death (autophagic cell death and apoptosis) in PC12 cells. It was also found that blocking PI3K/AKT pathway by LY294002, abolished the protection of H2S against scratch-induced cellular reactive oxygen species level and NRF2 accumulation and function in the nucleus. These results suggest that hydrogen sulfide protects against cell damage induced by scratch injury through modulation of the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. This study raises the possibility that hydrogen sulfide may have therapeutic efficacy in traumatic brain injury.

Abstract: Ionizing radiation (IR) causes severe damage to the hematopoietic system; thus, it is necessary to explore agents or compounds that can reduce this damage. SS31 is a mitochondria-targeted peptide that can scavenge cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit the production of mitochondrial ROS. Therefore, in this study, we discuss the protective effect of SS31 on IR-induced hematopoietic system damage. Our results showed that treatment with 6 mg/kg SS31 elevated the survival rate of lethally irradiated mice and increased the numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin and platelets in mice exposed to 4 Gy whole-body irradiation. In addition, SS31 administration improved the number of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and the self-renewal and reconstitution abilities of these cells in irradiated mice. The elevation of ROS levels is the main cause of IR-induced hematopoietic system damage, and SS31 can effectively reduce the ROS level in HSPCs. The above results suggest that SS31 can protect the hematopoietic system from radiation-induced damage by reducing cellular ROS levels.

Abstract: GATA-6 is a transcription factor that participates in cell lineage differentiation and organogenesis in many tissue types. The abnormal expression of GATA-6 is associated with the development of diverse cancers. GATA-6 acts as an oncogene or tumor suppressor based on tumor origin. Here, we investigated the effects of GATA-6 on lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). We found that GATA-6 was significantly reduced in LSCC tissues compared with the paired normal tissues. The overexpression of GATA-6 inhibited LSCC cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, a luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that GATA-6 negatively regulated the expression of sonic hedgehog (Shh) by directly binding to its promoter region. Furthermore, N-Shh stimulation rescued the inhibition of LSCC cell proliferation and migration upon GATA-6 overexpression. Thus, GATA-6 inhibited the proliferation and migration of LSCC cells by transcriptionally inhibiting the expression of Shh, indicating that targeting GATA-6 may be a potential approach for LSCC therapy.
