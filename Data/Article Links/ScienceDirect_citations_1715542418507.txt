Abstract: In this study, novel kinds of form-stable composite phase change materials (FS-CPCM) were prepared by the vacuum impregnation method. In the FS-CPCM, lauric acid (LA) was the PCM, and LA was grafted on the surface of graphene aerogel (GA) by an esterification reaction and reduction process to prepare supporting material and increase the thermal conductivity of the FS-CPCMs. The microstructure, thermal storage properties, thermal conductivity and light-to-heat conversion of the FS-CPCMs were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to demonstrate that the LA was encapsulated effectively in the porous structure of the LA-GA, and the LA/LA-GA FS-CPCMs were prepared successfully. X–ray diffractometer results confirmed that the crystallization of the LA/LA-GA FS-CPCM was better than that of LA/GA FS-CPCM. Thermal conductivity analyses indicated that the thermal conductivities of the LA/LA-GA-1 FS-CPCMs increased 352.1% and 32.6% compared with the conductivities of LA and LA/GA FS-CPCM, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry results confirmed that the LA/LA-GA-1 FS-CPCM possess good phase change behavior, low undercooling and excellent thermal cycling stability. The melting enthalpy and freezing enthalpy could reach 207.3 J/g and 205.8 J/g, respectively, and the LA/LA-GA FS-CPCM exhibited good thermal reliability and stability. Furthermore, the LA/LA-GA FS-CPCM had excellent photon absorption and the highest efficiency in terms of light-to-heat conversion of 80.6%. Such good performances demonstrate the LA/LA-GA FS-CPCM's potential for use in solar energy storage systems.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of advanced hydrogenation and low-temperature diffusion processes (a 3 h 700 °C process after emitter diffusion) for the electrical neutralization of laser-induced defects for laser doped and grooved solar cells. Despite the laser doping and grooving (LDG) process being performed before silicon nitride passivation to avoid thermal expansion mismatch between the silicon and the silicon nitride layer, some crystallographic defects are still formed during the process. The application of a low-temperature diffusion process increases implied open circuit voltages by 14 mV, potentially due to phosphorus diffusion of dislocated regions induced during laser processing. Laser hydrogenation is shown to be capable of passivating the majority of the remaining laser-induced defects. Over 1% absolute improvement in efficiency is achieved on cells with a full area aluminum back surface field. Preliminary results with minimal optimization demonstrate efficiencies of over 19% with a full area Al back contact cell. The potential to achieve much higher voltages when used with a passivated rear is also demonstrated.

Abstract: Quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) usually suffer from a strong recombination effect or low stability, resulting in a low efficiency and limiting their practical application. A facile liquid-phase synthesis of antimonene quantum dots (AMQDs) with unique morphology and size distribution is demonstrated, and applied as an effective photoactive material in QDSSCs for the first time. The intrinsic advantages of AMQDs, in association with a strong light–matter interaction, moderate energy band-gap in the visible range and antioxidation properties, enable an impressive photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) to be obtained, where the hysteresis-free AMQD-based solar cells can reach up to 3.07%. Furthermore, the as-fabricated solar cell shows a long-term stability, where the PCE value maintains to more than 90% of the initial value after 1000 h. In view of highly cost-effective synthesis and outstanding photoelectrochemical performance, we anticipate that AMQDs will have a promising future in solar cells and related photonics applications. AMQDs may provide a new direction for the rapidly developing photovoltaic technology, which is necessary for further developments in this field.

Abstract: To gain higher efficiency than that of traditional lattice-matched solar cells, newly designed up-grown metamorphic (UMM) InGaP/InGaAs/Ge solar cells were grown on Ge substrates. The defects in UMM InGaP/InGaAs/Ge can be perfectly controlled, and thus the conversion efficiency exceeds 30%. Similarly, the radiation environment in space could also cause displacement damage in UMM solar cells, causing the degradation of electrical properties. Proton irradiation at 50 keV and 150 keV was tested on the UMM solar cells. Because the top InGaP layer is thick enough, the radiation defects are limited within the top subcell without affecting the underlying subcells. In this research, 50-keV protons cause more serious degradation of short-circuit current, whereas 150-keV protons cause more serious degradation of open-circuit voltage. The difference may be related to the distribution of defects, which is calculated by The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter (SRIM). Defects in the junction region would cause the decrease in voltage, whereas defects in the surface region could cause degradation of current. As a comparison, lattice-matched GaInP/GaAs/Ge solar cells were also irradiated by low-energy protons. The degradation under 150-keV protons is more serious because the damage peak lies in the middle GaAs layer, which has poor radiation resistance. The degradation under 70-keV proton irradiation proves that a thinner GaInP layer improves the radiation resistance. It is notable that the degradation of short-circuit current and maximum power is influenced by the equivalent displacement damage dose (DDD), but this is not accurate for open-circuit voltage. The artifact signals at 700–750 nm after 50-keV proton irradiation indicate the decrease in shunt resistance of the InGaP subcell during proton irradiation.

Abstract: A flexible transparent electrode film is fabricated by coating the conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS using a solution-shearing process on PET film in which silver nanoparticles are embedded in intaglio grids patterned by a roll-to-roll thermal imprinting method. The composite electrode shows a sheet resistance of 20 Ω square−1 and a light transmittance of 82.9% at room temperature. An all-solution polymer solar mini sub-module is fabricated on the flexible electrode by further depositing ZnO and P3HT:PC61BM layers using the optimized solution-shearing process with subsequent printing of PEDOT:PSS and flat-screen printing of silver. The structure and morphology of the solution-shearing processed films examined by XRD and AFM show smoother surfaces and higher crystallinity than those of conventional spin-coated films. The solution-shearing-processed flexible polymer solar mini sub-module fabricated on an area of 36 cm2 shows a power conversion efficiency of 1.87% under an AM 1.5G solar simulator. Therefore, the solution-shearing process toward large-area flexible polymer solar module fabrication is successfully demonstrated.

Abstract: Cu-Zn-Sn-S sulfide precursors with various thicknesses, ranging from 0.8 µm to 1.7 µm were annealed under two types of annealing atmosphere: a pure (Se) atmosphere and a mix of (S+Se) one. Pure (Se) annealing led to the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) phase with a Se gradient from front to back surface. Annealing under mixture of (S+Se) improved the homogeneity of the CZTSSe solid solution across the whole layer thickness and prevented the S loss from sulfide precursor. This increased the band gap of the absorber, but enhanced the occurrence of S-rich secondary phases, mainly ZnS thin layers formed at the Mo/CZTSSe interface. The decrease of the absorber thickness can limit the occurrence of secondary phases and affects electrical parameters of the solar cells. While the best cell efficiency of 7.1% was obtained for a 1.7 µm-thick layer annealed under pure Se atmosphere, the best and homogeneous average efficiencies on 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 samples were obtained for a 0.8 µm-thick layer annealed under (S+Se) atmosphere. These results showed clearly the trade-off to find between the annealing atmosphere and the thickness of the absorber.

Abstract: Ubiquitination is a prevalent post-translation modification system that is involved in almost all aspects of eukaryotic biology. It involves the attachment of ubiquitin, a small, highly conserved protein to selected substrates. The most notable function of ubiquitin is the targeting of modified proteins to the multi-proteolytic 26S proteasome complex for degradation. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) regulates the abundance of numerous enzymes, structural and regulatory proteins ensuring proper cellular function. Plants utilize the UPS to facilitate cellular changes required to respond to and tolerate adverse growth conditions. In this review, the regulatory role of the UPS in responses to abiotic stress is discussed, particularly the function of ubiquitin-dependent degradation in the suppression, activation and attenuation or termination of stress signaling.

Abstract: Molten chloride salts are promising advanced high-temperature (400–800 °C) thermal energy storage (TES) and heat transfer fluid (HTF) materials in next generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants for higher energy conversion efficiencies. However, severe corrosion of structural materials in contact with molten chloride salts is one of the most critical challenges limiting their applications at elevated temperatures. In this work, two corrosion mitigation strategies are investigated to alleviate the hot corrosion of structural materials in molten chloride salts: (1) adding corrosion inhibitor and (2) using a Fe-Cr-Al alloy with a protective alumina layer on the surface after pre-oxidation. Three commercial high temperature Fe-Cr-Ni alloys (SS 310, Incoloy® 800 H and Hastelloy® C-276) were exposed to molten MgCl2-NaCl-KCl (60–20–20 mol%) mixed salts with 1 wt% Mg as corrosion inhibitor, for 500 h at 700 °C under inert atmosphere. By addition of the Mg inhibitor, the corrosion rates of the studied alloys were found to be significantly reduced, more precisely by ~ 83% for SS 310, ~ 70% for In 800 H and ~ 94% for Ha C-276 compared with the exposure tests without Mg addition. The corrosion mitigation mechanism of Fe-Cr-Ni based alloys in molten chloride salts by adding Mg is discussed based on corrosion thermodynamics. To assess the second mitigation strategy two pre-oxidized alumina forming Fe-Cr-Al alloys were exposed to the same molten chloride salts without Mg corrosion inhibitor under the same conditions. It is observed that the adherent alumina scales can effectively inhibit the dissolution of Cr and Fe and the bulk penetration of corrosive impurities. Overall, both strategies offer enormous potential for enhancing the expected lifetime of commercial alloys in molten chloride salts.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCM) have stable operation temperature and large storage capacity. However, PCM have problems of leakage and low thermal conductivity. For improving performances of PCM, stearic acid (SA) was encapsulated in silica shell by sol-gel method to form microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCM), and graphene oxide (GO) was attached to surface of silica by a self-assembly process to form GO@MPCM, so as to further improve performances of MPCM. The morphology of MPCM was observed through a scanning electronic microscope (SEM). The chemical structure and crystal phase of MPCM were measured by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscope (FT–IR) and X–ray diffractometer (XRD). Raman spectrometer was used to further verify that GO was attached to the MPCM. Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) analysis confirmed that MPCM have good thermal stability. Thermal properties of MPCM were measured by Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), where melting temperature and latent heat of MPCM2 is 67.78 °C and 179.29 J/g. The melting temperature of GO@MPCM is similar to that of MPCM2, and the melting latent heat of GO1 @MPCM and GO2@MPCM is 146.72 J/g and 134.42 J/g, respectively. Besides, thermal conductivity of MPCM with GO is higher than that of pure SA.

Abstract: Cell heterogeneity studies using single-cell sequencing are gaining great significance in the era of personalized medicine. In particular, characterization of tumor heterogeneity is an emergent issue to improve clinical oncology, since both inter- and intra-tumor level heterogeneity influence the utility and application of molecular classifications through specific biomarkers. Majority of studies have exploited gene expression to discriminate cell types. However, to provide a more nuanced view of the underlying differences, isoform expression and alternative splicing events have to be analyzed in detail. In this study, we utilize publicly available single cell and bulk RNA sequencing datasets of breast cancer cells from primary tumors and immortalized cell lines. Breast cancer is very heterogeneous with well defined molecular subtypes and was therefore chosen for this study. RNA-seq data were explored in terms of genes, isoforms abundance and splicing events. The study was conducted from an average based approach (gene level expression) to detailed and deeper ones (isoforms abundance/splicing events) to perform a comparative analysis, and, thus, highlight the importance of the splicing machinery in defining the tumor heterogeneity. Moreover, here we demonstrate how the investigation of gene isoforms expression can help to identify the appropriate in vitro models. We furthermore extracted marker isoforms, and alternatively spliced genes between and within the different single cell populations to improve the classification of the breast cancer subtypes.

Abstract: Nanocomposites consisting of paraffin/graphene nanoplatelets mix embedded in carbon foams via vacuum infiltration were fabricated with the aim of developing new phase change material (PCM) formulation with excellent shape stabilization, improved thermal conductivity and outstanding thermal reliability and structural stability. Physicochemical and thermal properties of the nanocomposites were evaluated using a suite of techniques such as scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflection - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption analyzer, differential scanning calorimetry, mechanical tester, Raman spectroscopy, thermal conductivity analyzer and thermogravimetric analyzer. The carbon foams exhibited good cyclic compressive behavior at a strain of up to 95% and kept part of their elastic properties after cyclic testing. Due to the robust mechanical integrity and layered meso-/macroporous morphology of these carbon foams, the nanocomposites are well equipped to cope with volume changes without leaking during thermal cycling. A 141% thermal conductivity enhancement observed for the carbon foam nanocomposite demonstrates the contributing role of the carbon foam in creating effective heat transfer through its conductive 3D network. The results have shown that proper chemical modification and subsequent carbonization of the low cost porous foams can lead to ultralight multifunctional materials with high mechanical and physical properties suitable for thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: The maintenance of homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium depends on the complex process of epithelial cells differentiation, which repeatedly continues throughout the entire life. Many studies suggest, that cellular differentiation is regulated by glycosylation, or at least that changes of the latter are the hallmark of the process. The detailed description and understanding of this relationship are important in the context of gastrointestinal tract disease, including cancer. Here we employ a broadly used in vitro model of intestinal cell differentiation to track the glycosylation changes in details. We analyzed the glycoproteome- and glycosecretome-derived N-glycomes of undifferentiated Caco-2 adenocarcinoma cells and Caco-2-derived enterocyte-like cells. We used HILIC-HPLC and MALDI-ToF-MS approach together with exoglycosidases digestions to describe qualitative and quantitative N-glycosylation changes upon differentiation. Derived glycan traits analysis revealed, that differentiation results in substantial upregulation of sialylation of glycoproteome and increment of fucosylation within glycosecretome. This was also clearly visible when we analyzed the abundances of individual glycan species. Moreover, we observed the characteristic shift within oligomannose N-glycans, suggesting the augmentation of mannose trimming, resulting in downregulation of H8N2 and upregulation of H5N2 glycan. This was supported by elevated expression of Golgi alpha-mannosidases (especially MAN1C1). We hypothesize, that intensified mannose trimming at the initial steps of N-glycosylation pathway during differentiation, together with the remodeling of the expression of key glycosyltransferases leads to increased diversity of N-glycans and enhanced fucosylation and sialylation of complex structures. Finally, we propose H4N5F1 glycan as a potential biomarker of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation.

Abstract: For decades, VO2-based smart windows have aroused much interest in energy efficient materials. To meet the practical requirements, VO2-based thin films should exhibit a high quality performance in equilibrating the solar modulation ability (ΔTsol) and the luminous transmittance (Tlum) simultaneously. More importantly, durability and fatigue performance, which determine the life-time in actual use, have rarely been properly explored and obviously cannot be neglected. Herein, SiNx/VO2, VO2/SiNx and SiNx/VO2/SiNx multilayer structures were proposed and prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering in this work. The amorphous SiNx not only acts as the antireflection layer for promoting optical performance, but also serves as the ions diffusion barriers or passivation layers on the bottom and/or top of VO2. As expected, the optimized composite structures successfully enhanced the solar modulation ability (from 10.8% to 14.5%, 34% maximum increase rate of ΔTsol) and luminous transmittance (from 36.1% to 40.4%, 12%maximum increase rate Tlum-L) compared with single-layer VO2, in accordance with our optical modeling. More significantly, fatigue property had been unprecedentedly proposed and measured in about 2 years, demonstrating an ultra-long heating-cooling cycling times (104 cycles) in ambient atmosphere for SiNx/VO2/SiNx structure, exhibiting a dramatic life-time of 27 years, while the single layer VO2 could only provide the life-time of 4 years (1.6 × 103 cycles). Moreover, SiNx/VO2/SiNx structure also presented excellent durability on hot and wet condition, which is three times as the VO2 film without SiNx. Complementally, the improvement of the hydrophobicity with SiNx surface was found by contact angle test, which would make it possible to form an unobstructed view on rainy day. In conclusion, our works can provide facile structures and novel assessment method on fatigue performance for VO2-based films, and promote the industrial application for smart windows.

Abstract: Cathepsin S (CTSS), a lysosomal cysteine protease, has been reported to be associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, thus promoting cell migration and invasion, but whether CTSS regulates other intracellular mechanisms during metastasis remains unknown. The expression of CTSS was knocked down using siRNA transfection, and enzymatic activity was inhibited by the highly-selective CTSS inhibitor RJW-58. The results of in vitro functional assays, western blot analysis, and an in vivo colonization model demonstrated that CTSS was positively related to cellular adhesive ability. Moreover, both CTSS knockdown and inhibition significantly decreased Ca2+ influx via store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) without changing STIM1 and Orai1 expression levels, while RJW-58 dose-dependently reduced the activation of the Ca2+-dependent downstream effectors, NFAT1 and Rac1. The results of immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that CTSS could bind to STIM1, which was reversed by CTSS inhibition. In addition, confocal microscopy and super-resolution imaging showed that CTSS inhibition led to STIM1 puncta accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and reduced the interaction between active STIM1 and EB1. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that the lysosomal cysteine protease, CTSS, plays an important role in mediating Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating STIM1 trafficking, which leads to the suppression of cell migration and invasion.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Certain hemostatic anomalies found in patients with thalassemia suggest the existence of a chronic hypercoagulable state. Several etiologic factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hypercoagulable state in those patients. One of these factors is abnormal thalassemic red blood cells (RBCs), which may provide a procoagulant. To substantiate these findings, we measured the ability of RBCs from thalassemia patients to bind annexin V with increased fraction of platelets carrying the activation marker CD62P (P-selectin). To study the expression of RBC annexin V and platelets P-selectin in study patients (those with thalassemia major, thalassemia intermedia, thalassemia minor) and control group, four-color flow cytometry was performed and the correlation between these two markers was evaluated.
Methods
A case–control study was conducted on 50 β-thalassemia patients (10 patients with thalassemia minor, 30 patients with thalassemia major, and 10 patients with thalassemia intermedia, with 10 normal adult volunteers as a control) from June 2016 to March 2017. Flow cytometry was used to study the expression of anionic phospholipids (Annexin V) on the RBCs and CD62P (P-selectin) on the activated platelet.
Results
The mean expression of annexin V in patients with thalassemia major and intermedia was significantly higher than that in the control group and patients with thalassemia minor. Although the mean expression was higher in patients with thalassemia intermedia than in those with thalassemia major, it was not statistically significant.
Conclusion
The mean expression of platelets P-selectin in patients with thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia was significantly higher than that in controls and patients with thalassemia minor. However, its expression was significantly higher in patients with thalassemia intermedia than in those with thalassemia major. Annexin V also showed a positive correlation with P-selectin, and both markers positively correlated with regularity of blood transfusion.

Abstract: Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing proteins have been shown to regulate cellular processes by hydroxylating or demethylating histone and non-histone targets. JMJD8 is a Jumonji C domain-containing protein localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and was recently shown to be involved in endothelial differentiation and cellular inflammation response. However, other physiological functions of JMJD8 remain to be elucidated. In this research, we found that knockdown of JMJD8 in cancer cells significantly increased cell proliferation, and attenuated ionizing irradiation or etoposide treatment-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) level through enhancing the expression of Ku70 and Ku80 which are key participants in the non-homologous end-joining repair of DSBs. We also provided evidence to show that knockdown of JMJD8 up-regulated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression which contributed to the enhanced expression of Ku70/Ku80 as shown by the results that pre-treatment of JMJD8 knockdown cells with COX-2 selective inhibitor NS-398 inhibited the induction of Ku70/Ku80. Furthermore, we identified that the up-regulation of COX-2 in JMJD8 knockdown cells was partially due to the increased activation of AKT/NF-κB signaling, and LY294002 (an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway) repressed the induction of COX-2 and Ku70/Ku80. In conclusion, our research provided data to establish the role of JMJD8 in regulating tumor cell proliferation and their sensitivity to ionizing irradiation or chemo-therapy drug, and the AKT/NF-κB/COX-2 signaling mediated expression of Ku70/Ku80 was involved. The results of this research indicated that JMJD8 is a potential target for enhancing the efficacy of tumor radio- and chemo-therapies.

Abstract: Plasma membrane transporter SLC6A14 transports all neutral and basic amino acids in a Na/Cl – dependent way and it is up-regulated in many types of cancer. Mass spectrometry analysis of overexpressed SLC6A14–associated proteins identified, among others, the presence of cytosolic heat shock proteins (HSPs) and co-chaperones. We detected co-localization of overexpressed and native SLC6A14 with HSP90-beta and HSP70 (HSPA14). Proximity ligation assay confirmed a direct interaction of overexpressed SLC6A14 with both HSPs. Treatment with radicicol and VER155008, specific inhibitors of HSP90 and HSP70, respectively, attenuated these interactions and strongly reduced transporter presence at the cell surface, what resulted from the diminished level of the total transporter protein. Distortion of SLC6A14 proper folding by both HSPs inhibitors directed the transporter towards endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway, a process reversed by the proteasome inhibitor – bortezomib. As demonstrated in an in vitro ATPase assay of recombinant purified HSP90-beta, the peptides corresponding to C-terminal amino acid sequence following the last transmembrane domain of SLC6A14 affected the HSP90-beta activity. These results indicate that a plasma membrane protein folding can be controlled not only by chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum, but also those localized in the cytosol.

Abstract: LncRNA FAL1 has been demonstrated to play an important role in promoting carcinogenesis via the ceRNA mechanism in several types of cancer. However, the role and the mechanism of lncRNA FAL1 in CRC remain unclear. Here our results demonstrate that lncRNA FAL1 is markedly upregulated in CRC tissues and cells, and lncRNA FAL1 promotes proliferation ability, migration and invasion in CRC cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that lncRNA FAL1 acts as a sponge of miR-637, which functions as a suppressor via targeting and downregulation of NUPR1 expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that lncRNA FAL1 promotes carcinogenesis of CRC cells via regulation of the miR-637/NUPR1 pathway. Taken together, our findings underscore the crucial roles of lncRNA FAL1 in CRC carcinogenesis and its potential prognostic and therapeutic value.

CYP1B1 prevents proteasome-mediated XIAP degradation by inducing PKCε activation and phosphorylation of XIAP,

Abstract: Cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of 17β-estradiol (E2) into catechol estrogens, such as 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2) and 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE2). CYP1B1 is related to tumor formation and is over-expressed in a variety of cancer cells. In particular, CYP1B1 is highly expressed in hormone-related cancers such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, or prostate cancer compared to other cancers. However, the detailed mechanisms involving this protein remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CYP1B1 affects X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression. When CYP1B1 was over-expressed in cells, there was significant increase in the XIAP protein level, whereas the XIAP mRNA level was not affected by CYP1B1 expression. Treatment with 4-OHE2, mainly formed by CYP1B1 activity, also increased XIAP protein levels, whereas treatment with 2-OHE2 did not have a significant effect. Treatment with 4-OHE2 significantly prevented proteasome-mediated XIAP degradation. In addition, phosphorylation of XIAP on serine 87, which is known to stabilize XIAP, was up-regulated by 4-OHE2, indicating that 4-OHE2 affects XIAP stability through XIAP phosphorylation. We also found that phosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC)ε, which is required for XIAP phosphorylation, increased when cells were treated with 4-OHE2. In summary, our data show that CYP1B1 may play an important role in preventing ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated XIAP degradation through the activation of PKCε signaling in cancer cells.

Abstract: Due to the low absorbance in the far-red (FR) and near-infrared (NIR) “optical window”, NIR fluorescent proteins (FPs) are powerful tools for deep imaging. Here, we report three new, highly bright NIR FPs termed BDFP1.8, BDFP1.8:1.8 (tandem BDFP1.8) and BDFP1.9, which evolved from a previously reported FR FP, BDFP1.6: a derivative of ApcF2 from Chroococcidiopsis thermalis sp. PCC7203. ApcF2 binds phycocyanobilin (PCB) non-covalently, while BDFPs, the derivatives of ApcF2, can bind biliverdin (BV) covalently. We identified that dimeric BDFP1.8 and monomeric BDFP1.8:1.8 have a 2.4-and 4.4-fold higher effective brightness, respectively, than iRFP720, which has the highest effective brightness among the reported NIR FPs. Monomeric DBFP1.9 (17 kDa) has one of the smallest masses among highly bright FPs in the FR and NIR regions. Enhancing the affinity between the apo-proteins and the BV chromophore is an effective method to improve the effective brightness of biliprotein FPs. Moreover, BDFP1.8 and 1.9 exhibit higher stability to temperature, pH and light than iRFP720. Finally, the highly bright NIR BDFP1.8 together with FR BDFP1.6 could effectively biolabel cells in dual colors.

Abstract: The main aim of this study is to prepare and characterize PCM/diatomite composites with impregnation method using unmodified and microwave modified diatomite. The effect of microwave modification of diatomite on composites was investigated. In this study, lauric acid (LA) was used as the phase change material and the prepared PCM/diatomite composites were analysed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and laser diffraction particle size analyser. Thermal stability of composites was demonstrated by thermal resistance test. The results show that the composites prepared with microwave-modified diatomite have higher heat capacities than those prepared with unmodified diatomite. According to the DSC analysis, composites with modified diatomite have melting and freezing temperatures of 40.4 and 39.5 °C, respectively. These composites also have the latent heats of melting and freezing of 55.7 and −49.9 J/g, respectively. According to the analysis and thermal resistance test, it was seen that composites were prepared successfully. After the determination of better thermal energy storage properties of microwave-modified diatomite containing composites than unmodified diatomite containing composites, we recommend that these composites can be used for thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: Metal halide perovskite materials have revolutionized the solution-processed solar cells and become the vanguard of research focus with an unprecedented improvement of power conversion efficiencies up to 23.3%, which pose a remarkable challenge to thin film and multicrystalline silicon photovoltaics. Nevertheless, for conventional perovskite solar cells based on lead, it is ineluctable to take the toxicity of lead and the long-term stability of the devices into consideration when the deployment of this technology in mass production is put on the agenda. To tackle the toxicity concern, extensive research effort has been devoted to the development of environmentally friendly lead-free halide perovskites for photovoltaic applications. Herein, we review the advancements in this emerging research area and discuss potential alternative elements to replace lead within the halide perovskite lattice. Particular attention will be focused on the properties of the corresponding perovskites and the relevant production of high efficiency photovoltaic devices, with the aim of identifying the materials to be competitive with lead-based perovskites. For the moment, tin-based perovskites appear likely to be the most preeminent from the point view of power conversion efficiency, despite the stabilities of the materials and the related devices are far from satisfaction. The introductions of germanium, bismuth, antimony, and certain transitional metals into perovskites brought about promising optoelectronic properties as well. This booming class of compounds constitutes unexplored territory and emerges as an affordable and robust candidate for green solar technology.

Abstract: The capture cross-section, intersubband optical cross-section and non-radiative emission rates related to localized hole states are obtained for p-i-n solar cells containing GaSb/GaAs quantum rings embedded within the i-region of the device. The technique developed uses the intraband photoemission current to probe the charge state of the nanostructures during two-color excitation. Analysis of the excitation power dependence revealed a non-radiative hole capture lifetime of 12 ns under low excitation conditions, with high injection leading to the saturation of the hole occupancy within the quantum-rings. The decay characteristics of the optical hole emission current has also been exploited to determine the spectral and temperature dependence of the radiative and non-radiative hole escape mechanisms from the quantum-rings.

Abstract: Cancer immunotherapy is based on the ability of the immune system to recognize tumors as foreign tissue. The idea of cancer immunosurveillance was first conceived over a century ago but remained controversial through much of the 20th century. In the past few decades, however, the field has progressed rapidly, and the concept of tumor immunosurveillance is now well established. With this chapter, we provide a historical background of immunosurveillance, the concept of immunoediting, and the role of different T-cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment. We also discuss the relationship between immune checkpoints, tumor antigens, T cell receptor repertoire, and immunosurveillance. Finally, we comment on the future of immunotherapy as it relates to T cell immunosurveillance.

Abstract: In concentrating solar power plants, the heat capacity of thermal storage media is a key factor that affects the cost of electricity generation. This work investigated the effective specific heat capacity of binary nitrate eutectic salts seeded with silica nanoparticles, using both experimental measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of the mass concentration (0–2.0 wt%) and average size (10, 20, and 30 nm) of the nanoparticles on the specific heat capacity value of nanofluids were analyzed. The results show that specific heat capacity increases when adding 10 nm silica nanoparticles up to 1.0 wt%, and then it decreases at higher concentrations. At this optimal mass concentration, the 20 nm nanoparticles displayed a maximum enhancement in the average specific heat capacity (by ~26.7%). The simulation results provided information about the different energy components in the system. The rate of potential energy change versus nanoparticle mass concentration was found to be maximized at 1.0 wt% concentration, which agrees with the experimental measurements. The potential energy components in the simulation system indicate that the change of Coulombic energy contributes the most to the variation of specific heat capacity.

Abstract: In flowering plants, sexual reproduction is actively regulated by cell–cell communication between the male pollen and female pistil, and many species possess self-incompatibility systems for the selective rejection of self-pollen to maintain genetic diversity. The Brassicaceae self-incompatibility pathway acts early on when pollen grains have landed on the stigmatic papillae at the top of the pistil. Extensive studies have revealed that self-pollen rejection in the Brassicaceae is initiated by an S-haplotype–specific interaction between two polymorphic proteins: the pollen S-locus protein 11/S cysteine-rich (SP11/SCR) ligand and the stigma S receptor kinase (SRK). While the different S-haplotypes are typically codominant, there are several examples of dominant–recessive interactions, and a small RNA-based regulation of SP11/SCR expression has been uncovered as a mechanism behind these genetic interactions. Recent research has also added to our understanding of various cellular components in the pathway leading from the SP11/SCR–SRK interaction, including two signaling proteins, the M-locus protein kinase (MLPK) and the ARM-repeat containing 1 (ARC1) E3 ligase, as well as calcium fluxes and induction of autophagy in the stigmatic papillae. Finally, a better understanding of the compatible pollen responses that are targeted by the self-incompatibility pathway is starting to emerge, and this will allow us to more fully understand how the Brassicaceae self-incompatibility pathway causes self-pollen rejection. Here, we provide an overview of the field, highlighting recent contributions to our understanding of Brassicaceae self-incompatibility, and draw comparisons to a recently discovered unilateral incompatibility system.

Abstract: Introduction
Systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis can lead to an acquired coagulopathy secondary to acquired factor X (aFX) deficiency. However, it is not very clear who develops aFX deficiency in AL amyloidosis.
Methods
We therefore undertook this single centre, retrospective study to better characterize AL amyloidosis-associated aFX deficiency.
Results
Out of 121 AL patients who had FX testing at the time of their first evaluation at our institution, including 17 patients on warfarin at the time of testing, 10 out of 104 patients (9.6%) with systemic AL amyloidosis were found to have FX levels below 50%. Acquired FX deficiency was associated with advanced stage of AL amyloidosis and elevated cardiac biomarkers. Lower FX activity, advanced stage, and cardiac involvement by disease were associated with higher hazard of death on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, stage of AL amyloidosis was the only significant predictor of survival. Median survival time of patients with FX deficiency was 9.3 months compared to 118.4 months in those without.
Conclusions
We conclude that while aFX deficiency is rare in systemic AL amyloidosis, it is a marker of advanced disease.

Abstract: A series of new green Cr-doped BiPO4 materials were synthesized by hydrothermal method and first used as solar heat-reflective pigments. XRD, FTIR, FE-SEM and HR-TEM analyses confirm that the phase structure was transformed from low-temperature monoclinic phase (LTMP) to hydrated hexagonal phase (HP), the particle size decreased and the morphology changed from irregular prism-shaped to rod-shaped, which all attributed to the incorporation of Cr3+ ions. Moreover, the valance of chromium ions was also confirmed by XPS. Color and ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV–Vis–NIR) analysis indicate that different hues of green were obtained in these solid solutions and they possessed high NIR reflectance (>83%) and solar reflectance (>86%) in total NIR region. Meanwhile, the reason of decrease in NIR reflectance of doped samples was also analyzed, which mainly due to the decrease of free carrier concentration. TG-DTA and corrosion resistance tests prove that these pigments have excellent thermal and chemical stability. Compared with pure PMMA and the existing reports on pigmented PMMA, the NIR reflectance of PMMA pigmented with Cr-doped BiPO4 pigments have been greatly improved and have good coloring performance. The NIR solar reflectance of PMMA colored with Bi0.85Cr0.15PO4 in shortwave NIR region reaches up to 77.83%, an increase of nearly 52%. Heat aging test shows that Cr-doped BiPO4 pigments significantly improve the aging resistance of PMMA. In conclusion, these pigments have potential to become plastic colorants to increase the NIR reflectance and aging resistance of plastics.

Abstract: CuSbS2 (CAS) thin films were grown with different Cu/Sb precursor ratios using a non-vacuum-based hybrid ink method. The prepared precursor inks were coated on Mo-coated soda lime glass and a subsequent sulfurization process was carried out. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed the presence of the CuSbS2 phase for an optimal Cu/Sb precursor ratio; for other ratios, additional secondary phases were also observed. Then, CuSbS2 solar cells were fabricated to compare the photovoltaic performances. The sample with the pure CuSbS2 phase showed better photovoltaic properties than those films containing secondary phases. The best CuSbS2 solar cell with optimum Cu/Sb ratio exhibited the conversion efficiency of 2.75%. The temperature-dependent light and dark current density–voltage (JV-T) characteristics were measured to investigate the recombination process, and R–J curves were extracted to study the photovoltaic characteristics, including parasitic resistances. The depletion width and carrier concentrations were also compared from capacitance–voltage (C-V) measurements of the solar cells prepared with the films of various Cu/Sb ratios. Using admittance spectroscopy (AS), the dominant defect energy level was deduced and determined as 0.23 eV above the valence band maximum. Drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP) was applied to characterize the defect behavior of the device with optimum Cu content.

Abstract: The photovoltaic (PV) industry requires efficient cutting of large single and multi-crystalline (sc- and mc-) silicon (Si) wafers. Historically multi-wire slurry sawing (MWSS) dominated, but the higher productivity of diamond-wire-sawing (DWS) holds promise for decreasing PV costs in the future. While surface texturing of DWS wafers is more complicated than of MWSS wafers, especially in mc-Si wafers, nanotexturing has been shown to overcome this challenge. While the benefit of nanotexturing is thus clearer in mc-Si, a universal nano-texture process that also works on sc-Si would simplify and reduce the investments costs of PV production-lines. In this paper, such a nano-texture process is developed using a metal-assisted chemical etch (MACE) technique. Step-by-step characterization of surface structure and reflectance of the MACE process is used after: 1) wafering, 2) standard acidic texturing etch, 3) silver nanoparticles deposition, and 4) MACE nanotexturing for both sc and mc-Si. The results show that the same MACE process works effectively for both sc-Si and mc-Si wafers. Finally, the nano-textured wafers are processed into PV cells in an industrial process line with conversion efficiencies of 19.4% and 18.7%, for sc-Si and mc-Si solar cells, respectively.

Abstract: Glycosylation and its by-product, the glycan, play a crucial role in many cellular processes. Aberrant glycan structures and mutations of the glycosylation pathway have been intricately linked with the development of cancer and more recently with cancer's ability to escape the innate immune system. This chapter aims to elucidate how glycosylation interacts with the immune system to promote tumor deviation through endogenous lectins, mutated glycosphingolipids, sialic acid domains, and more. This chapter also explores the mechanisms of glycosylation that may lead to powerful translational therapeutic tools, such as glycotransferase inhibitors, glycan/glycopeptide-based vaccines, and antibody-based immunotherapies, all of which have shown great promise clinically in the field of immuno-oncology.

Abstract: Treatment failure through radioresistance of tumors is associated with activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Tumor cell proliferation, DNA-repair, hypoxia and metastases-formation are four mechanisms in which EGFR signaling has an important role. However, the effect of hypoxia on EGFR expression is still controversial. In this study, we demonstrated that hypoxia enhanced EGFR expression and sustained cell survival in SiHa, CAL 27 and A549 cells at both low and high cell desnities, while in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and HeLa cells, EGFR and cell survival were regulated by hypoxic treatment in a cell-density dependent manner: upregulated at low cell density and downregulated at high cell density. In MCF-7 and HeLa xenografts in nude mice, EGFR expression varied inversely with the pimonidazole level that was used as an indicator of hypoxia, accordant with the effect of hypoxia at high cell density in vitro. Hypoxia induced more remarkable cell autophagy at high cell density than at low cell density. Autophagy inhibitor 3MA, rather than proteasome inhibitor MG132 inhibited hypoxia-mediated EGFR loss and shifted cell death to cell survival in HeLa cells. The MCF7 cells’ sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) under hypoxia was also conditional on the cell densities when the hypoxia treatment was introduced, inversely associated with the expression levels of EGFR. Altogether, hypoxia can decrease EGFR expression in some cell lines by enhancing autophagy at high cell density, leading to cell death and hypersensitivity to radiotherapy. This study may help to understand how hypoxia influences EGFR expression and radiosensitivity.

Abstract: An optically rough and physically flat (OR-PF) TCO substrate was developed by spin-coating Al-doped ZnO thin film on glass substrate patterned with random pyramidal morphology to enhance the light absorption in superstrate-type thin-film silicon solar cells without deteriorating the growth of photoactive layers. This substrate possesses flat surface with a root mean square roughness of 10.9 nm, high visible light transmittance of over 86%, a sheet resistance of 29.5 Ω/sq, and moderate light-scattering ability. A surface morphology of random pyramidal morphology was formed on the glass substrate by replicating the pyramidal surface texture of a ZnO thin film with the room-temperature nanoimprint technique. Employed as the front electrode of hydrogenated amorphous Si single-junction solar cells, this OR-PF substrate enabled a Voc of 0.91 eV, an FF of 0.71, a Jsc gain of approximately 8%, and an efficiency gain of approximately 20% with respect to the AZO-coated flat glass substrate. The Jsc gain is attributed to the enhancement in the light absorption of a-Si:H solar cells triggered by the diffraction behaviour of the interfacial pyramidal morphology, while the achievement of large Voc and FF is ascribed to the improvement in the growth quality of the photoactive layers. Based on the calculation results of the bidirectional scattering distribution function, this substrate empowers comparable intensity of the diffraction peaks for 600–700 nm wavelength light but scatters less light away from the specular direction with respect to the conventional pyramid-textured ZnO substrate. This OR-PF substrate would enable efficient photon management and the growth of high-quality photoactive materials simultaneously for thin-film silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Nanoencapsulated phase change materials (NEPCMs) are a crucial part of solar energy systems due to their high thermal storage density. The particle size of the NEPCMs is especially of great importance due to its effect on heat transfer and long-term use during applications. In this paper, lauric acid (LA)/SiO2 nanocapsules with various particle sizes were prepared with a sol-gel method. The results showed that the latent heats of these nanocapsules could reach as high as 165.6 J/g, with an encapsulation ratio of 85.9%. Additionally, the latent heat values of the samples reduced slightly (less than 10%) after 1200 thermal cycles. Furthermore, an analysis of the mechanism of the size control of the LA/SiO2 nanocapsules was conducted. By analysing the size change of the samples under different synthetic conditions, it was found that the size of the nanocapsules was principally controlled by the concentration of OH-, and the encapsulation ratio of nanocapsules is affected by the cumulative percentage of emulsion droplets and the shell thickness. Thus, the optimal particle size of 340 nm for the nanocapsules was confirmed.

Abstract: Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been applied in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) as electrode modifier or third component in bulk due to their high charge carrier mobility, various electronic band structure, and facile fabrication via liquid phase exfoliation. Herein, solution exfoliated few layers black phosphorus (BP) and tungsten diselenide (WSe2) were used as third component in bulk heterojunction OPVs, resulting in improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 8.60% for reference device, to 9.20% and 9.24% for devices based on BP and WSe2, respectively. Thorough study has been executed to look into the bulk morphology change and intermolecular charge transfer behavior within the OPV device by means of atomic force microscopy, grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results show that a neat BHJ morphology and low energetic loss donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces were achieved when incorporated with BP nanoflakes or WSe2 nanofalkes, leading to suppressed exciton recombination and enhanced charge transport property. Besides, more balanced bipolar carrier mobility within the bulk also helped boost the performance of OPVs. The storage and operating stabilities of the devices are also improved after incorporating with BPNFs or WSNFs. This work suggests the potential application of 2D materials as third component in OPV applications.

Abstract: The soiling of photovoltaic (PV) modules can significantly reduce their energy yield unless a mitigation strategy is employed. One solution investigated in this work involves the implementation of a passive self-cleaning superhydrophobic top cover. To this end, superhydrophobicity was induced by hot-embossing random microtextures on a highly transmissive and photostable fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) film. The impact of fabrication parameters (hot-embossing force and temperature) on achieving high contact angles (> 150°) and low roll-off angles (< 10°), which characterizes a surface as superhydrophobic, were investigated. It was found that a minimum threshold force of at least 15 kN and 5 kN must be used to achieve superhydrophobicity for processing temperatures of 270 °C and 280 °C respectively. Meanwhile at the highest investigated temperature of 290 °C, any force within the investigated range of 500 N to 50 kN suffices. The best fabrication parameters were identified (5 kN at 280 °C), resulting in a contact angle of 156 ± 1° and a roll-off angle of 8 ± 3°. When incorporated into a silicon PV mini-module, the addition of the textured FEP film enhances the short circuit current density (JSC) by 1.1%. Moreover, the self-cleaning properties of the textured FEP films result in a recovery ratio of 93.6% (in terms of JSC), which is significantly greater than that of the reference glass encapsulated PV mini-module (61.1%).

Abstract: Fluorine and aluminum co-doped ZnO (FAZO) films were deposited on glass substrates by RF magnetron sputtering. The effects of the substrate temperature (Tsub) on the structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties of the films were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis, atomic force microscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, Hall effect measurement, and ultraviolet–visible–near infrared spectrophotometry. All the thin films showed typical wurtzite structure with the c axis preferentially oriented perpendicular to the substrate. With increasing Tsub, the grain size shows a parabolic-like enhancement; the film surface became relatively smooth and dense, and the crystallinity was also improved. At Tsub = 320 °C, the films showed the best electrical properties, with a resistivity of 3.53 × 10−4 Ω cm, Hall mobility of 39.33 cm2/V s, and carrier concentration of 4.50 × 1020 cm−3. An optical transmittance of more than 80% in a wide wavelength range from 400 to 1200 nm was also achieved. Perovskite solar cells employing the FAZO film had a higher power conversion efficiency than reference cells using F-doped SnO2 and Sn-doped In2O3, demonstrating its suitability for application in high-efficiency solar cells.

Abstract: Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a noninvasive therapeutic method via the activation of certain chemical sensitizers using low intensity ultrasound. In this work, we evaluated the antitumor effect of sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS) mediated SDT (DVDMS-SDT) on Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that DVDMS-SDT was significantly more efficacious than PpIX-SDT in treating hepatocellular cell line Hep-G2. DVDMS-SDT also increased the ratio of cells in the G2/M phase and decreased the CDK1 and Cyclin B1 protein level. DVDMS-SDT markedly increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro. The increased ROS production up-regulated the expression of p53 and Bax, and down-regulated Bcl-2 expression, which led to the activation of caspase-3, ultimately initiated cell apoptosis. These effects could be partially reversed by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). In vivo experiments revealed that the DVDMS-SDT resulted in an effective inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. More importantly, no obvious signs of side effects were observed. These results suggested that DVDMS-SDT is very effective in treating Hepatocellular carcinoma without side effects. The primary mechanism of SDT is due to the increased ROS activated the p53/Caspase 3 axis of apoptosis.

Abstract: We studied the hysteresis and electric field effects on planar CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite devices, synthetized from laser-ablated precursors, by means of electrical characterizations at different scan rates and optical measurements. The aim of our investigation is to characterize the phenomena behind perovskite degradation under prolonged applied electric field. Using a perovskite more resistant to electric field induced degradation, we run long time characterizations that were not accomplishable before. Thus, we distinguished all the degradation-involved phenomena. The results point to the presence of ions migrating in the perovskite when the device is biased. Our data showed that ion migration degrades the interfaces with the consequent creation of degradation layers that limit the current injected in the device and the extracted photocurrent. These layers where detected also by means of optical Raman characterization. In order to explain the details of the mechanisms concurring to the observed behaviors, we presented a qualitative model. The observed phenomena exacerbated by the planar structure are even more destructive on standard solution processed perovskites to which the results of this work can be extended. Since, the same degradation dynamics occur on vertical devices, typical on perovskite solar cells, this work provides a useful in-depth analysis of the ionic migration effects.

Abstract: Nitrate eutectic salts is the most widely used heat transfer heat storage medium for solar thermal power generation, but the risk of corrosion under high temperature becomes challenge to the system stability and safety. In this work, the corrosion behavior and mechanism of three austenitic stainless steels 310S, 316L and 321 were studied experimentally in a new quaternary molten salt KNO3-NaNO2-NaNO3-KCl. The composition and morphology of the corrosion products were analyzed by using the methods of XRD and SEM-EDX. The results show that the corrosion rates of three stainless steels are 0.499, 1.460 and 1.895 µm/year, respectively. Both 316L and 321 have obvious Cr depletion region resulting in intergranular corrosion. By comparison, 310S has the best corrosion resistance in this quaternary molten salt. It is also found that Mo and Ti cannot inhibit the occurrence of intergranular corrosion, but accelerate the dissolution of σ-phase and TiC in the quaternary molten salt. Besides, the corrosion behavior of 321 based pipe in actual service conditions for a long-time running of about 9 years. Compared with the short-term test, the surface of the metal is thoroughly corroded with the similar corrosion products and the distribution of elements.

Abstract: The nano-particles of double perovskite oxide Sm2NiMnO6 (SNMO) are synthesized by the sol-gel method. The synthesized SNMO nano-particles are characterized by the X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. By combining experiments with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we suggest that SNMO can be used as a promising solar cell absorber. The measured direct optical band gap of 1.41 eV is found to be very close to the Shockley-Quiesser band gap value of a single junction solar cell. DFT calculations show that SNMO has a large value of absorption coefficient in the visible region, which is comparable to that of some standard photovoltaic materials such as Si, CH3NH3PbI3, etc. The calculations also show that SNMO possesses a strong birefringence (-0.26), which is also very promising for various nonlinear optical applications. In addition the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B under the visible light and photocurrent density measurements under a simulated sunlight (AM1.5G) are performed to elucidate the photosensitive nature of SNMO.

The device is based on an interdigitated back-contact silicon solar cell, in which the p- and n-regions are connected in a combination of series and parallel contacts, in order to triple the photovoltage compared to a single-junction cell. Our best device provides an open-circuit voltage of 1.99 V, larger than the water redox potential of 1.23 V plus overpotentials at the electrodes, as well as a short-circuit current density of 12.6 mA/cm2. Coupled to a sulphuric acid electrolysis system, with platinum and ruthenium dioxide electrodes, our device shows an STH of 14.5% at 1.63 V.

Abstract: Post-synaptic density-95, disks-large and zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domains are small globular protein–protein interaction domains widely conserved from yeast to humans. They are composed of ∼90 amino acids and form a classical two α-helical/six β-strand structure. The prototypical ligand is the C-terminus of partner proteins; however, they also bind internal peptide sequences. Recent findings indicate that PDZ domains also bind phosphatidylinositides and cholesterol. Through their ligand interactions, PDZ domain proteins are critical for cellular trafficking and the surface retention of various ion channels. In addition, PDZ proteins are essential for neuronal signaling, memory, and learning. PDZ proteins also contribute to cytoskeletal dynamics by mediating interactions critical for maintaining cell–cell junctions, cell polarity, and cell migration. Given their important biological roles, it is not surprising that their dysfunction can lead to multiple disease states. As such, PDZ domain–containing proteins have emerged as potential targets for the development of small molecular inhibitors as therapeutic agents. Recent data suggest that the critical binding function of PDZ domains in cell signaling is more than just glue, and their binding function can be regulated by phosphorylation or allosterically by other binding partners. These studies also provide a wealth of structural and biophysical data that are beginning to reveal the physical features that endow this small modular domain with a central role in cell signaling.

Abstract: Immeasurably low surface recombination of crystalline-silicon wafers is demonstrated with an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) corona charged dielectric stack. We detail experimental variations to each layer of the dielectric stack to establish a procedure which provides outstanding passivation properties on textured and planar silicon wafers. We demonstrate surface recombination velocities of < 1 cm/s and surface recombination prefactors of < 1 fA/cm2, and we show that passivation remains stable over a 2-year period when stored in ambient conditions. The effective carrier lifetimes of n-type silicon are found to exceed the commonly accepted intrinsic lifetime limit, and in one case, a lifetime of 170 ms is attained. These high lifetimes indicate that ONO passivation is amongst the best dielectric passivation, and as such, might find applications in high-efficiency silicon solar cells.

Abstract: The practical use of organic phase change materials (PCMs) for solar thermal energy storage is limited by the leakage problem and the low thermal conductivity. As a good supporting and thermal conductive framework for organic PCM with shape-stability, three-dimensional carbon sponges are produced by the direct carbonization of low-cost and sustainable biomass cotton. The carbon sponges are consisted of aerogels of the cotton-derived hollow carbon fibers, which have both interconnecting network and high porosity. The vacuum impregnated paraffin@carbon sponge composites not only present leakage-proof shape stability and enhanced thermal conductivity, but also show high thermal storage energy density (>200 J g-1, slightly lower than the pure paraffin) and good cyclability. The results indicate that the shape-stable PCMs as supported by cotton-derived carbon sponges are potentially to be widely used for thermal energy conversion and storage, especially for solar energy utilization.

Abstract: RBMX is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear RNA binding protein that is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome. RBMX belongs to a small protein family with additional members encoded by paralogs on the mammalian Y chromosome and other chromosomes. These RNA binding proteins are important for normal development, and also implicated in cancer and viral infection. At the molecular level RBMX family proteins contribute to splicing control, transcription and genome integrity. Establishing what endogenous genes and pathways are controlled by RBMX and its paralogs will have important implications for understanding chromosome biology, DNA repair and mammalian development. Here we review what is known about this family of RNA binding proteins, and identify important current questions about their functions.

Abstract: Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) devices based on GaInAsSb lattice matched to GaSb (100) substrates have demonstrated high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) in the mid-infrared spectral range, making them promising candidates for waste heat recovery from high temperature “blackbody” sources. In this work, the GaInAsSb alloy has been integrated onto more cost-effective GaAs (100) substrates by using advanced metamorphic buffer layer techniques in molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which included an interfacial misfit (IMF) array at the GaSb/GaAs interface followed by GaInSb/GaSb dislocation filtering layers. The threading dislocations in the GaInAsSb region can be efficiently supressed, resulting in high quality materials for TPV applications. To determine the performance of the GaInAsSb TPV on GaAs it was compared with a cell grown lattice matched onto GaSb substrate having the same structure. The resulting TPV on GaAs exhibited similar dark current-voltage characteristics with that on GaSb. Under illumination from an 800 °C silicon nitride emitter, the short circuit current density (Jsc) from the GaInAsSb TPVs on GaAs reached more than 90% of the control cell on GaSb, and the open circuit voltage (Voc) exceeded 80% of the cell on GaSb. The EQE from the TPV on GaAs reached around 62%, the highest value reported from this type of TPV on GaAs. With improved TPV structure design, large area GaInAsSb TPV panels on GaAs substrates can be realized in the future for waste heat energy recovery applications.

Abstract: Multiple transmission–reflection (MTR) infrared (IR) spectroscopy was established as a new IR method to measure the interstitial oxygen and substitutional carbon contents of polycrystalline silicon wafers at ambient temperature. The superiority of MTR–IR to conventional IR was verified through practical measurements of polycrystalline silicon samples. With single incidence, the following characteristics of the former were superior to those of the latter. (1) The areas of the absorption peaks of interstitial oxygen at 1107 cm−1 and substitutional carbon at 605 cm−1 can be amplified linearly with transmission times N between 10 and 12, thereby extending the limit of detection of oxygen and carbon to approximately one order of magnitude lower. (2) The strength of the interference fringes of the baseline can be decreased to 5 times that of the single incidence for a 1 mm polycrystalline silicon slice. (3) In contrast to conventional IR method in which data are gathered from one sampling point at each measurement, MTR–IR collects information from many sampling points in a long sample for one-time measurement. In conclusion, MTR–IR is more sensitive, reliable, and reproducible than the conventional IR method in terms of measuring the interstitial oxygen and substitutional carbon contents of polycrystalline silicon.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Toxic erythema of chemotherapy (TEC) is a well-recognized adverse cutaneous reaction to chemotherapy. Similar to many skin diseases, the clinical presentations may vary. Our objective is to expand on the typical and atypical clinical and histopathological presentations of TEC.
Methods
Forty patients with a diagnosis of TEC were included from 500 patients who had undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Relevant information and demonstrative photos and pathology were selected.
Results
Classic clinical presentations included hand and foot erythema and dysesthesias; atypical presentations included facial involvement, hyperpigmentation, dermatomyositis-like, and erythroderma associated with capillary leak syndrome.
Conclusion
The diagnosis of TEC should be considered after a correlation of clinical and histological findings in conjunction with a timeline of chemotherapy administration. Suggested criteria for the diagnosis of TEC may be helpful to dermatologists and clinicians when caring for these patients.

Abstract: Passive radiative cooling is a promoting way for thermal energy management. High reflectance of solar light and high emittance in the atmospheric window (8–13 μm) are acquired for effective radiative cooling. In this work, we demonstrate a daytime passive radiative cooler using chemically fabricated porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes. Effective medium theory (EMT) has been applied to analyzing the optical properties of the air-doped porous medium. The composite structure is specifically optimized so that it has a high absorbance (emittance) in the far-infrared atmospheric window and nearly no loss in the solar spectrum. The calculated emittance is well reproduced in the experiment by our AAO sample. The fabricated porous membrane shows a potential cooling power density of 64 W/m2 at ambient temperature (humidity ~70%) under direct sunlight irradiance (AM1.5). Experimentally, the sample is cooled by a 2.6 °C temperature reduction below the ambient air temperature in the sunlight. This performance shows little variance at night. The AAO approach proposed here may provide a promising way to produce low-cost and efficient radiative cooler in large scales for feasible energy conservation.

Abstract: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a major cause of cancer metastasis, and deregulation of the transcription factor, Twist1, is a critical molecular event in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The importance of Twist1 protein turnover in this process has not yet been defined. Here, we show that HR23A directly targets the Twist1 protein without changing its gene transcription. Our experiments reveal that: HR23A interacts with Twist1, and this promotes the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of Twist1. Depletion of HR23A enhances Twist1 protein levels, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cancer cell migration and various cancer stemness properties, including the expression of major pluripotency factors, the capacity for tumor-sphere formation in culture and the expression of cancer stem cell surface markers. The increases of these stemness properties are reversed by ectopic expression of HR23A or further knockdown of Twist1 in HR23A-depleted cells. Thus, HR23A-knockdown cells appear to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition and take on certain attributes of cancer stemness. Together, our findings indicate that HR23A importantly contributes to regulating Twist1 protein stability, and suggest that altering the stability of Twist1 by modulating HR23A may be a new avenue for therapeutic intervention in cancer.

Abstract: Alternative splicing (AS) constitutes a pivotal mechanism for expanding the transcriptome and proteome diversity in higher eukaryotes. In contrast, misregulated AS events are relevant to carcinogenic signatures, including migration, angiogenesis, immortality, and drug resistance of cancer cells. Using a transcriptome analysis, discriminative splicing profiles of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α transcripts were identified in tumorous tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues of lung cancer (LC) patients. In cancerous tissues or LC-derived cells, relatively high levels of HIF-1α-ex14 transcripts encoding the HIF-1αS isoform were noted compared to adjacent normal tissues and non-cancerous cells. The HIF-1αS isoform exhibited a more-prominent effect than that of the HIF-1αL isoform translated from HIF-1α+ex14 transcripts on enhancing promoter activities of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), serine/arginine splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), and c13orf25 genes. An increase in the SRSF1 protein facilitated the generation of HIF-1α-ex14 transcripts, whereas overexpression of RNA-binding motif protein 4 (RBM4) enhanced the expression of HIF-1α+ex14 transcripts in the A549 cells. Results of splicing reporter assays demonstrated the differential impacts of RBM4 and SRSF1 on the utilization of HIF-1α exon 14 in a CU element-dependent manner. In addition to transcriptional regulation, overexpression of the HIF-1αS and HIF-1αL isoforms differentially enhanced the metastatic signatures of A549 cells. Taken together, SRSF1 and RBM4 constitute an antagonistic mechanism on regulating the splicing profiles of HIF-1α gene, which is relevant to the oncogenic signatures of LC cells.

Abstract: Phosphorylation of the human α1B-adrenergic receptor (fused with the green fluorescent protein) was studied employing the inducible Flp-ln HEK293 T-Rex system for expression. Serine/alanine substitutions were performed in five sites corresponding to those previously identified as phosphorylation targets in the hamster ortholog. Desensitization was decreased in these mutants but receptor phosphorylation was still clearly detected. The protein phosphorylation of the wild-type receptor (fused to the green fluorescent protein) was studied, using mass spectrometry, under baseline and stimulated conditions (noradrenaline or phorbol myristate acetate). Basal phosphorylation was detected at sites located at the intracellular loop 3 and carboxyl terminus, and the number of sites detected increased under agonist activation and stimulation of protein kinase C. The phosphorylation patterns differed under the distinct conditions. Three of the phosphorylation sites detected in this work corresponded to those observed in the hamster receptor. The phosphorylation sites detected included the following: a) at the intracellular loop 3: serines 246, 248, 257, 267, and 277; and threonines 252, 264, and 268, and b) at the carboxyl terminus: serines 396, 400, 402, 406, 423, 425, 427, 455, and 470, and threonines 387, 392, 420, and 475. Our data indicate that complex phosphorylation patterns exist and suggest the possibility that such differences could be relevant in receptor function and subcellular localization.

Abstract: Forkhead box D3 (FOXD3) is a key transcription factor maintaining pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Yet to date studies on its role in human ESCs are quite limited. In this study, we report that deletion of FOXD3 in human ESCs results in loss of pluripotency and spontaneous differentiation toward meso-endoderm. Ectopic overexpression of FOXD3 in hESCs leads to two different phenotypes: Human ESCs expressing high levels of FOXD3 undergo spontaneous meso-endoderm differentiation, whereas those with lower levels of FOXD3 maintain pluripotency. Next we deleted endogenous FOXD3 in the low ectopic expression model and find that addition of exogenous FOXD3 at a low level could rescue FOXD3-deficiency phenotype in hESCs. In summary, our findings suggest that FOXD3 dose-dependently regulates the balance of human ESCs between pluripotency and meso-endoderm fates, which adds to our understanding of the role of FOXD3 in humans.

Abstract: The performance of the eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl-α-alumina and-mullite composites (melting point of 626.0 °C) with different salt to ceramic ratios (45:55, 50:50, 55:45, 60:40, wt%) was investigated to evaluate their potential application as novel high temperature (> 600 °C) phase change materials for solar thermal energy storage. The results show that the thermal stability of these composites decreases with increased salt content. The eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl-α-alumina and- mullite (45:55, wt%) composites show better thermal performance than the composites with other mass ratios after 20 thermal heating-freezing cycles at the temperature range of 550–680 °C in air. 300 thermal cycle tests were therefore carried out with each of these two composites to evaluate their longer-term thermal stability. The results show that the cycled Na2SO4-NaCl/α-alumina (45:55, wt%) composite has a weight loss of 4.6% and its heat of fusion decreases from 117.8 J/g to 105.3 J/g while the cycled Na2SO4-NaCl/mullite (45:55, wt%) composite has a weight loss of 6.9% and its heat of fusion decreases from 117.6 J/g to 98.6 J/g. XRD and SEM-EDS analysis confirm that the eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl salt has good chemical compatibility with α-alumina and mullite ceramic materials, where no chemical reaction and phase separation occurs in the two composites during the 300 thermal cycling test. Addition of α-alumina and mullite (55 wt%) to the eutectic Na2SO4-NaCl salt can improve its thermal conductivity by more than 3 times with α-alumina having a better enhancement than mullite.

Abstract: The use of durable high solar absorptance receivers is a key element in a CSP plant project. In this article, different receiver materials are studied: four alloy substrates (T91, T22, VM12, Inconel 617) combined with four new absorber coatings, operable in solar towers with molten salts or steam as heat transfer fluids, and a classic Pyromark® paint considered as a reference. In order to test the durability of the coatings, 200 solar accelerated aging cycles were applied on the samples, using a concentrated solar facility (named SAAF). The cycles were defined so as to apply realistic high solar flux and temperature on the front side of the samples, and with high cooling and heating rates reproducing the fast variation of solar irradiation due to cloudy weather and subsequent thermal shocks. The optical characteristics of the coatings were measured at the beginning and at regular intervals during the aging procedure. Different behaviors of the coatings were observed depending on the substrate, before any aging cycle. After this first aging campaign, some evolutions were observed on the solar absorptance or thermal emittance, depending on the substrate and the coating. Nevertheless, the degradations noticed are not significant enough to conclude about the durability of the coatings.

Abstract: An n-type Si nanowire (SiNW) solar cell based on transition metal oxides V2O5 and TiO2 has been fabricated. The cell is demonstrated in the ITO/V2O5/n-SiNWs/TiO2/Al heterojunction structure, in which the V2O5 and TiO2 work as the hole- and the electron-selective layers, respectively. Parameters of cells with different lengths of nanowires have been investigated. Owing to the excellent light trapping effect of nanowire arrays and superior carrier transporting properties of thin V2O5 and TiO2 layers, an improved power conversion efficiency of 12.7% has been achieved in a cell with 1.45-μm-long nanowires. Due to the large work function difference between V2O5 and n-Si, a build-in potential of 0.75 V was obtained from the capacitance-voltage measurement, which implies the possibility of achieving a large open circuit voltage for these nanowire solar cells. The efficiency loss is mainly caused by the recombination via the defects on the unpassivated surface of SiNWs. By solving this problem, the cell efficiency may be improved further and realize the application in PV industries.

Abstract: Dislocations originating from the seed junctions are the most harmful defects in quasi-single crystalline silicon (QSC-Si). In traditional <100>-oriented QSC-Si ingots, dislocations easily develop into cascade shape, or even further form sub-grain boundaries as the ingot grows. In this paper, we have developed a novel <110>-oriented QSC-Si ingot to control the gliding and propagation of dislocations. It is found that the cascade shape is absent and dislocations only aggregate in the {100}/{100} boundary planes of <110>-oriented seeds, revealed by the minority carrier lifetime mapping and photoluminescence image. Accordingly, the internal quantum efficiency of <110>-oriented QSC-Si solar cells is obviously higher than that of the traditional <100>-oriented ones. Nevertheless, it should be noticed that the average photoelectric conversion efficiency of <110>-oriented QSC-Si solar cells could be 0.6% lower than that of traditional ones if the {100}/{100} boundary is included in the solar cell, due to a higher reverse leakage current. This problem can be involved by enlarging the size of seed crystals or adopting better seed arrangement. These results provide a new promising method for the development of high quality QSC-Si in photovoltaic industry.

Abstract: Adaptive immune responses that occur in infection, cancer, and autoimmune as well as allergic diseases involve the participation of T cells. T cells travel throughout the body searching for antigens, which are recognized via the major histocompatibility complexes. In the healthy organism, these T cells maintain metabolic quiescence until they encounter a potentially cognate antigen. Once activated, e.g., during an infection or tissue damage, T cells switch their metabolic program to gain energy and building blocks to maintain cellular homeostasis and to fulfill their specific immune functions involving clonal expansion and/or differentiation into effector and memory T cells to ultimately ensure host survival. Thus, differences in metabolism in healthy and pathogenic T cells provide an explanation for dysfunctionality of T-cell responses in metabolic disorders, autoimmunity, and cancer. Here, we summarize current knowledge on T-cell metabolism during the maintenance of homeostasis, activation, and differentiation as well as over the course of time that memory is generated in health and in diseased states such as autoimmunity and cancer.

Abstract: In this work, multifunctional polyurethane-based phase change materials with zinc oxide (ZnO) and graphene aerogel (GA) were prepared through facile impregnation. ZnO and GA improved the latent heat of the system from 86.8 J/g to 108.1 J/g for the heterogeneous nucleation and chemical mitigations. Furthermore, the photo-/electro-thermal energy conversion efficiency of the system with ZnO and GA is 80.1%, 84.4%, respectively, for the efficient light absorption of ZnO and GA as well as the electrical conductivity of GA. The as-prepared materials with high latent heat, excellent form-stability, remarkable thermal stability as well as reliability, efficient light-/electro-thermal energy conversion, have great prospects for applying in energy harvesting, conversion and storage devices like solar heater, smart textile and greenhouse.

Abstract: Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) is a promising low-cost and low-toxicity photovoltaic material. The electron buffer layer is of great significance for superstrate Sb2Se3 thin film solar cells. Herein, high-performance Sb2Se3 solar cells were fabricated by using sputtered, bandgap-tunable oxygenated cadmium sulfide (CdS:O) as a novel class of electron buffer layers. The optical transparency and energy band levels of CdS:O buffers were precisely adjusted by controlling the oxygen content in CdS:O layers. With the incorporation of an optimized wide band-gap CdS:O electron buffer layer, the device parameters JSC, VOC and FF were all improved. An efficiency of as high as 6.29% was achieved. It's found that, besides the reduced light absorption in the CdS:O layer, the high-quality CdS:O/Sb2Se3 junction played a vital role in the efficiency enhancement. The optimization of interfacial band alignment and defects passivation by atomic oxygen both contribute to the improved quality of CdS:O/Sb2Se3 heterojunction. This study demonstrates that the sputtered CdS:O is a promising electron buffer layer for preparation of high-efficiency and large-area Sb2Se3 thin film solar cells.

Abstract: In recent years latent heat energy storage (LHES) has received a worldwide focus in the area of solar still applications. Among various techniques available to improve the productivity of solar stills, heat storage is one of the proverbial areas in the present scenario. LHES surpasses sensible heat energy storage (SHES) in solar still applications owing to its properties like latent heat, thermal conductivity, etc. Focus has to be given in the selection of suitable LHES material since its properties are very significant during the performance and operation of solar stills. Though previous reviews on LHES in solar stills focus only on the productivity enhancement, this paper presents an up to date comprehensive review exclusively about LHES in solar stills focusing on its productivity, properties of LHES materials and the mechanisms behind the variation in properties of LHES materials. Further, in addition to this, a detailed analysis is also presented in this paper by employing analytical hierarchy process (AHP) which enable the researchers to prioritize the properties during the selection of LHES in solar still applications. Besides AHP analysis, we also evaluate the relative efficiency of the available LHES materials for solar still application by data envelopment analysis (DEA) to find the frontier LHES materials thereby suggesting the methods to augment the properties of the frontier material (identified through DEA analysis). Thus, this paper may be a reference guide in the near future for the academicians, researchers to get an overview about the various LHES materials used in solar stills and significance of their properties for improving the yield in solar still applications.

Abstract: In this study of the fabricated perovskite solar cells, flowing nitrogen is introduced during the spin coating of the precursor to remove the solvent vapor. The precursor is then aged prior to the anneal to obtain a pinhole-free perovskite film. Both the nitrogen flow and precursor aging methods resulted in improved film quality. The phase composition and orientation of the CH3NH3PbI3 phase was tuned through control of the aging time. This lead to high-performance CH3NH3PbI3 planar perovskite solar cells with power conversion efficiency over 16%. The intermediate phase composition was sensitive to the ambient atmosphere. The content of the PbI2 in the final CH3NH3PbI3 films varied with precursor aging time. The combination of nitrogen flow and suitable aging time resulted in films with enhanced (110)-orientation, compactness, charge carrier lifetimes, and correspondingly power conversion efficiencies.

Abstract: Conventional resources of energy production by burning fossil fuels are detrimental to the earth's atmosphere leading to serious problems such as global warming and acid rain. As a result, renewable and green energy technologies have gained lot of attention in the recent years. In particular, the improvement of solar panel efficiency has grabbed a significant domain of researchers’ interest since sun is the year-round available source of energy that can be efficiently utilized for energy generation. However, a significant part of the incident solar energy is being lost due to the reflection at the air/glass interface as well as the accumulation of dusts on the modules. Hence, the surface morphology and characteristics of solar panel surfaces have recently been enhanced using multifunctional thin films or coatings in order to improve their self-cleaning, anti-reflection, anti-fogging and energy transmittance properties of the coated solar panels. A wide range of materials and methods have been employed in fabrication of solar panel coatings including superhydrophobic, superhydrophilic and photoactive coating surfaces. In this review, the current state of fabrication of solar panel coatings and their properties, including surface morphology, wettability, electrical conductivity and light transparency characteristics, are discussed. The review starts with discussing the fundamental concept of self-cleaning (i.e., superhydrophobicity/superhydrophilicity) and antireflective (i.e., transparency) properties followed by presenting a review of the recent methods and technologies used in manufacturing of superhydrophobic, superhydrophilic, photoactive and transparent thin films used in solar panel coatings. More importantly, the recent development on the fabrication and application of self-cleaning and dust-repellent antireflective coatings in solar modules have been discussed. Lastly, recent reports on advanced coatings with hybrid functionalities such as self-healing and antimicrobial activity are presented.

Abstract: Elimination of cancer cells through antitumor immunity has been a long-sought after goal since Sir F. Macfarlane Burnet postulated the theory of immune surveillance against tumors in the 1950s. Finally, the use of immunotherapeutics against established cancer is becoming a reality in the past 5years. Most notable are the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against inhibitory T-cell receptors cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 and programmed death-1.

Abstract: Phases in the Cu-Zn-Sn-S system are of interest to the solar and thermoelectrics communities because all elements are earth-abundant and non-toxic. A better understanding of the structures of these phases and the equilibria between them is necessary to guide device manufacturers. This work reviews all the phases reported in this system and reports which phases form and are stable at 200 °C and 400 °C. In this work, the stable phases in the Cu-Zn-Sn-S system (Cu4Sn7S16, Cu4SnS4, Cu2ZnSnS4, and Cu2SnS3) are synthesized and their structures are investigated using solid-state NMR, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The existing Cu-Sn-S and Cu-Zn-Sn-S phase diagrams are revised based on our synthesis results. Cu3SnS4 and Cu2ZnSn3S8 are removed from the quaternary and ternary phase diagrams because we did not observe either phase. Prior reports (in thin films and nanocrystals) of Cu3SnS4 may be related to trace amounts of In or large surface areas. Monoclinic Cu2SnS3 is not stable at 400 °C and, at this temperature, a disordered tetragonal phase is stable. At lower temperatures (room-temperature and 200 °C ), this same (disordered) tetragonal phase is stable at compositions that are Cu-rich and Sn-poor from Cu2SnS3. Cu4SnS6 was added to the phase diagram at 400 °C. Significant differences in reaction rate when forming Cu4SnS4 from either elemental or binary sulfide precursors are noted and explained. The NMR results are generalized to aid in distinguishing octahedral versus tetrahedral Sn4+ coordinations.

Abstract: We report on our attempt to perform the three-dimensional (3D) visualization of dislocation clusters in multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) ingot by processing photoluminescence (PL) images and analysis of dislocation clusters in mc-Si. As-sliced wafers prepared using a high-performance (HP) mc-Si ingot were sequentially measured by PL imaging with intentional superposition of reflection. Then, various image processing techniques were applied to all the PL images to extract dark regions, which most likely correspond to dislocation clusters, as well as microstructures. By 3D reconstruction using a large quantity of 2D images, we could successfully visualize the generation, propagation and annihilation of dislocation clusters in HP mc-Si ingot. In addition, relationship between source region of dislocation clusters and crystal orientation were investigated by combining data scientific and experimental approaches. As a result, it was suggested that small angle grain boundaries with angular deviation of less than 10 degrees cause the generation of dislocation clusters.

Abstract: The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is essential for normal heart function. However, p38 also contributes to heart failure pathogenesis by affecting cardiomyocytes contractility and survival. To unravel part of the complex role of p38 in cardiac function, we performed an APEX2-based proximity assay in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes and identified the protein interaction networks (interactomes) of two highly expressed p38 isoforms in the heart. We found that p38α and p38γ have distinct interactomes in cardiomyocytes under both basal and osmotic stress-activated states. Interestingly, the activated p38α interactome contains many RNA-binding proteins implicated in splicing, including the serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3). Its interaction with the activated p38α was validated by co-immunoprecipitation. The cytoplasmic abundance and alternative splicing function of SRSF3 are also both modulated by the p38 signaling pathway. Our findings reveal a new function for p38 as a specific regulator of SRSF3 in cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) undergo capillarization, or loss of fenestrae, and produce basement membrane during liver fibrotic progression. DLL4, a ligand of the Notch signaling pathway, is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells and maintains liver sinusoidal homeostasis. The aim of this study was to explore the role of DLL4 in LSEC capillarization. The expression levels of DLL4 and the related genes, capillarization markers and basement membrane proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and immunoblotting as appropriate. Fenestrae and basement membrane formation were examined by electron microscopy. We found DLL4 was up-regulated in the LSECs of human and CCl4-induced murine fibrotic liver, consistent with LSEC capillarization and liver fibrosis. Primary murine LSECs also underwent capillarization in vitro, with concomitant DLL4 overexpression. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed that DLL4 induced the production of basement membrane proteins in LSECs, which were also increased in the LSECs from 4 and 6-week CCl4-treated mice. DLL4 overexpression also increased the coverage of liver sinusoids by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) through endothelin-1 (ET-1) synthesis. The hypoxic conditions that was instrumental in driving DLL4 overexpression in the LSECs. Consistent with the above findings, DLL4 silencing in vivo alleviated LSEC capillarization and CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. In conclusion, DLL4 mediates LSEC capillarization and the vicious circle between fibrosis and pathological sinusoidal remodeling.

Abstract: Boron (B)-doped gradient Si-rich oxide multilayer (GSRO-ML) structure is utilized to realize super-high density Si quantum dots (QDs) thin films with large carrier tunneling probability by co-sputtering. The B-doping effect on crystalline, optical, electrical and photovoltaic (PV) properties of Si QD thin films is investigated in this study. With increased B-doping concentration, the preserved high crystallinity of Si QDs and the reduced optical bandgap are observed. An optimized doping condition is found for the electrical and PV properties. Further increasing the doping concentration leads to increased inactive B atoms and interfacial over-diffusion. The issue of interfacial over-diffusion can be efficiently improved by inserting lowly B-doped GSRO-ML thin films. Our results show the feasibility and great potential for high efficiency Si-based solar cells integrating Si QDs by properly doped B atoms in GSRO-ML thin film structure.

Abstract: Cellulose is one of the most abundant natural resource and can be used as biodegradable composite matrix material in many applications. Phase change materials (PCMs) are thermal energy storage (TES) materials and can reduce energy consumption of heating and cooling applications. This study aims to prepare cellulose-based composites containing myristic acid (MA) as PCM and methyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose as composite matrix using direct impregnation method without any pre-treatment or modification step. The primary aim in PCM composite production is to realize the phase change in the composite matrix by trapping the matter in the composite. The properties of composite material were determined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The maximum latent heat was measured 71.3 J/g for MA/methyl cellulose composites and 32.7 J/g for MA/hydroxyethyl cellulose composites. We recommended that the prepared leakage free cellulose-based composites can be used as biodegradable energy storage materials with good reliability and thermal properties for thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy and results from the clonal amplification of plasma cells. Despite recent advances in treatment, MM remains incurable with a median survival time of only 5–6years, thus necessitating further insights into MM biology and exploitation of novel therapeutic approaches. Both the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis, and treatment of MM and different lines of evidence suggest a close cross talk between these central cell-regulatory signaling networks. In this review, we outline the interplay between the UPS and mTOR pathways and discuss their implications for the pathophysiology and therapy of MM.

Abstract: P53 dysfunction has been associated with various malignant tumors, including acute leukemia. The overexpression of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) causes the inactivation of p53 in acute leukemia. MDM2 inhibitors that activate p53 and induce apoptosis are currently being developed for potential treatment of acute leukemia. However, MDM2 inhibitors alone have limited efficacy in acute leukemia therapeutics. Combining other drugs to enhance the efficacy of MDM2 inhibitors is the thus considered as a potential treatment scheme. Here, we report that the combination of Nutlin-3 and Tanshinone IIA synergistically induces cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagic cell death, thereby imparting anti-leukemia effect in an acute leukemia cell line with wild-type p53 by effectively activating p53, inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway, and activating the RAF/MEK pathway. Using primary samples from acute leukemia patients, we show that the combination of Nutlin-3 plus Tanshinone IIA synergistically induces cytotoxicity by activating p53 and inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway. This specific combination of Nutlin-3 and Tanshinone IIA is also effective in preventing the recurrence of refractory leukemia, such as Ph+ ALL with the ABL kinase T315I mutation and AML with the FLT3-ITD mutation. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that the Nutlin-3 plus Tanshinone IIA combination exerts synergistic anti-leukemia effects by regulating the p53 and AKT/mTOR pathways, although further investigation is warranted. Small-molecule MDM2 antagonists plus Tanshinone IIA may thus be a promising strategy for the treatment of acute leukemia.

Abstract: Microencapsulated phase change materials (MEPCMs) have been used for thermal regulation in different systems. MEPCMs are sometimes produced with functional groups to ease applications. This study focused on preparation, characterization, and determination of thermal properties of microencapsulated n-octadecane with poly(methyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate-co-acrylamide) shell. P(MMA-co-EGDM-co-AAm)/ n-octadecane shell microcapsules were prepared with 0.5%, 1%, and 2% AAm contend to make the outer surface functional. Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate was used as uniformity agent. Amide functionality is the first time imported to MEPCMs in this study. The particle size, chemistry, photography, size distribution, thermal storage property and stability of MEPCMs were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, polarized optical microscopy (POM), particle sizer distribution (PSD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques respectively. The average melting and freezing temperatures of the MEPCMs were consistent with pristine core material, n-octadecane, as the average of latent heats of melting and crystallization were similar to the contend ratio in the recipe. Besides, produced microcapsules were found resistant to degradation up to 142 °C. The results indicated that the microcapsules with amide functionality have potential to be used as a TES material.

Abstract: In this study, the stability of polymer-based photovoltaic fibers was investigated in ambient and inert atmosphere. Photovoltaic (PV) fibers, similarly produced by using both polymer blend of wide and low bandgap polymers (P3HT: PTB7: PCDTBT) and only wide bandgap (P3HT) polymer with [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in active layer were measured in ambient and in inert environment after dark storage, and then, their photovoltaic performances and stabilities were compared. Maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.01% was obtained from photovoltaic fiber with P3HT: PTB7: PCDTBT polymer blend. When stability results were considered, at end of 7th day, photovoltaic fibers having P3HT: PTB7: PCDTBT:PCBM active layer showed better performance than P3HT: PCBM-based PV fibers.

Abstract: Ligand-induced activation of Exchange Protein Activated by cAMP-1 (EPAC1) is implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes, including cardiac fibrosis where changes in EPAC1 expression have been detected. However, little is known about how EPAC1 expression is regulated. Therefore, we investigated regulation of EPAC1 expression by cAMP in cardiac fibroblasts. Elevation of cAMP using forskolin, cAMP-analogues or adenosine A2B-receptor activation significantly reduced EPAC1 mRNA and protein levels and inhibited formation of F-actin stress fibres. Inhibition of actin polymerisation with cytochalasin-D, latrunculin-B or the ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, mimicked effects of cAMP on EPAC1 mRNA and protein levels. Elevated cAMP also inhibited activity of an EPAC1 promoter-reporter gene, which contained a consensus binding element for TEAD, which is a target for inhibition by cAMP. Inhibition of TEAD activity using siRNA-silencing of its co-factors YAP and TAZ, expression of dominant-negative TEAD or treatment with YAP-TEAD inhibitors, significantly inhibited EPAC1 expression. However, whereas expression of constitutively-active YAP completely reversed forskolin inhibition of EPAC1-promoter activity it did not rescue EPAC1 mRNA levels. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation detected a significant reduction in histone3-lysine27-acetylation at the EPAC1 proximal promoter in response to forskolin stimulation. HDAC1/3 inhibition partially reversed forskolin inhibition of EPAC1 expression, which was completely rescued by simultaneously expressing constitutively active YAP. Taken together, these data demonstrate that cAMP downregulates EPAC1 gene expression via disrupting the actin cytoskeleton, which inhibits YAP/TAZ-TEAD activity in concert with HDAC-mediated histone deacetylation at the EPAC1 proximal promoter. This represents a novel negative feedback mechanism controlling EPAC1 levels in response to cAMP elevation.

Abstract: Films of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite (PEA)2(MA)n-1PbnI3n+1 (PEA = phenylethylammonium, MA = methylammonium) series (n = 1, 2, 3) show high stability in contrast to their three-dimensional counterparts. Development of an effective means to fabricate 2D perovskite solar cells which can achieve a better power conversion efficiency (PCE) and have less current density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis, is crucial to boost their applications. We present a one-step solution process to fabricate the 2D perovskite (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 as light absorbers in solar cells by adding methylammonium acetate (MAAc) in a precursor solution. With an appropriate molar ratio of MAAc, the 2D perovskite films show a smoother surface, higher coverage, and better crystallinity, resulting in an optimal PCE of 5.7%, and importantly, no J-V hysteresis.

Abstract: A closed-cycle system by storing and releasing solar energy without additional interchange of material is crucial for future high global energy demands. Here, we presented a solid-state molecular solar thermal fuels (STFs) composed of single-walled carbon nanotubes and azobenzene with push-pull electron structure (AZO-SWCNTs) employing the direct Friedel-crafts acylation reaction. This kind of STFs reveals the highest gravimetric energy density of 80.7 Wh kg−1 and power density of 292 W kg−1 in AZO-CNTs STFs system with extended half-lifetime and excellent photochemical cycling stability. Moreover, the high performance and closed cycle of storage and heat release of the solid-state STFs assembly film were also investigated. The STFs shows relatively a high energy storage efficiency (12.4%) and a solar energy storage efficiency (0.25%) with a maximum temperature difference of 10 °C. This kind of solid-state STFs film exhibits a great potency in high-energy and short-term solar energy thermal storage.

Abstract: Degradation of unwanted proteins is important in protein quality control cooperating with the dynein/dynactin-mediated trafficking along the acetylated microtubule (MT) network. Proteins associated directly/indirectly with tubulin/MTs play crucial roles in both physiological and pathological processes. Our studies focus on the interrelationship of the tubulin deacetylase HDAC6, the MT-associated TPPP/p25 with its deacetylase inhibitory potency and the hub dynein light chain DYNLL/LC8, constituent of dynein and numerous other protein complexes. In this paper, evidence is provided for the direct interaction of DYNLL/LC8 with TPPP/p25 and HDAC6 and their assembly into binary/ternary complexes with functional potency. The in vitro binding data was obtained with recombinant proteins and used for mathematical modelling. These data and visualization of their localizations by bimolecular fluorescence complementation technology and immunofluorescence microscopy in HeLa cells revealed the promoting effect of TPPP/p25 on the interaction of DYNLL/LC8 with both tubulin and HDAC6. Localization of the LC8-2-TPPP/p25 complex was observed on the MT network in contrast to the LC8-2-HDAC6 complex, which was partly translocated to the nucleus. LC8-2 did not influence directly the acetylation of the MT network. However, the binding of TPPP/p25 to a new binding site of DYNLL/LC8, outside the canonical binding groove, counteracted the TPPP/p25-derived hyperacetylation of the MT network. Our data suggest that multiple associations of the regulatory proteins of the MT network could ensure fine tuning in the regulation of the intracellular trafficking process either by the complexation of DYNLL/LC8 with new partners or indirectly by the modulation of the acetylation level of the MT network.

Abstract: A series of polyimides (PIs) was synthesized from 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfide and various aromatic or aliphatic dianhydrides to obtain shielding layers for solar cells. Structural design strategy involved combination of alicyclic or fluorinated chemical sequences together with aromatic units and thioether bridges to optimize the balance between thermal stability, optical transparency and refractive index. Molecular modeling revealed significant differences in the spatial molecular conformations between PIs based on aromatic dianhydrides and those containing aliphatic ones. The transmittance spectra reflect the effects of electron-acceptability, polarizability and symmetry of dianhydride moiety, which contribute distinctly to charge transfer complex interactions. Light dispersion in the PI films allowed evaluation of optical reflection losses at interface with ZnO or ZnO:Sn. In terms of transparency and refraction characteristics, it was concluded that PIs derived from either aromatic sulfur-based dianhydride or non-symmetric cycloaliphatic dianhydride render the best features that match the demands for shielding layers in solar cells.

Abstract: Daytime passive radiative cooling can achieve a cooling surface by reflecting the sunlight and radiating the heat to the outer space without consuming any energy. Aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) is a novel inorganic daytime passive radiative cooling material which has high solar reflectivity and high mid-infrared emissivity. The influence of heat treatment temperatures on crystallization behavior and optical properties are investigated by X-ray diffraction and spectrographs. The results demonstrate that increased heat treatment temperature will result in increased reflectivity but decreased mid-infrared emissivity. The effect of polyhedral structural differences between tridymite-type AlPO4 and cristobalite-type AlPO4 on mid-infrared and selective emissivity are discussed and analyzed. Furthermore, the tridymite-type AlPO4 fabricated at 700 °C possesses high solar reflectivity of 97% and selective emission with an emissivity of 0.90 across 8–13 µm. When made into coating, the optimum cooling effect could reach a temperature drop of ~4.2 °C lower than the ambient temperature and ~4.8 °C compared with commercial heat insulation coating under direct sunlight. This proves that AlPO4 is a promising energy-saving material for daytime passive radiative cooling application. Thus, it can greatly lower the indoor temperature and improve comfortability of people's living in buildings.

Abstract: Passivation quality of poly-Si contacts with different phosphorus doping concentration were investigated in this study. Intrinsic poly-Si layers were deposited by LPCVD on a tunnel oxide surface, followed by n + poly-Si doping and hydrogenation. For lightly doped poly-Si contacts with phosphorus concentration of 2.1×1019cm−3, higher temperatures and longer times increased iVOC achieving maximum value of 734 mV, as poly-Si grain size increases from 13 nm to 40 nm. However, for heavily doped poly-Si contacts with phosphorus concentration of 1.1×1020cm−3, iVOC decreased from 731 mV to 696 mV as annealing time increased from 10 to 60 min because Auger recombination rate increased from 9.3fA/cm2 to 21.6fA/cm2 as phosphorus in-diffusion occurs. The contact resistance of poly-Si contacts was also investigated to achieve a high fill factor. Finally, a poly-Si/SiOx/c-Si passivated contact solar cell using a poly-Si contact on the back and boron diffused emitter on the front was fabricated. As a result, high efficiency of 21.1% solar cell was achieved with VOC of 665 mV, JSC of 40.6 mA/cm2, and fill factor of 78.3%.

Abstract: The predominant expense for the manufacturing cost of new generation photovoltaic devices including perovskite solar cells (PSC) emanate from the use of indium tin oxide (ITO) as transparent electrodes and is due to its limited supply and patterning costs. The PSC devices also struggle with low lifetime, and thus it has a high potential of generating rapid end-of-life (EOL) products resulting in surged photovoltaic wastes. In addition, the PSC devices contain unfavorable toxic elements such as lead and thus any effort to tackle the problem would help the environmental sustainability. In this article, the aforementioned issues were solved by the quality recovery of patterned ITO substrates from old devices through “top-down” approach, which essentially stripped out the unsought component layers present on ITO and subsequently reused for fresh devices. The PSC recycling and ITO recovery was done by treating EOL device with a single non-volatile inexpensive alkaline solvent. The appropriately recovered ITO had shown (optical, surface and electrical) properties close to the reference and was found to be suitable for direct reuse as the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of recycled PSC varied only 0.85% less than the initial device.

Abstract: Trypanosomatid parasites cause devastating African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and Leishmaniasis that affect about 18 million people worldwide. Recently, we showed that the biogenesis of glycosomes could be the “Achilles' heel” of trypanosomatids suitable for the development of new therapies against trypanosomiases. This was shown for inhibitors of the import machinery of matrix proteins, while the distinct machinery for the topogenesis of glycosomal membrane proteins evaded investigation due to the lack of a druggable interface. Here we report on the identification of the highly divergent trypanosomal PEX3, a central component of the transport machinery of peroxisomal membrane proteins and the master regulator of peroxisome biogenesis. The trypanosomatid PEX3 shows very low degree of conservation and its identification was made possible by a combinatory approach identifying of PEX19-interacting proteins and secondary structure homology screening. The trypanosomal PEX3 localizes to glycosomes and directly interacts with the membrane protein import receptor PEX19. RNAi-studies revealed that the PEX3 is essential and that its depletion results in mislocalization of glycosomal proteins to the cytosol and a severe growth defect. Comparison of the parasites and human PEX3-PEX19 interface disclosed differences that might be accessible for drug development. The absolute requirement for biogenesis of glycosomes and its structural distinction from its human counterpart make PEX3 a prime drug target for the development of novel therapies against trypanosomiases. The identification paves the way for future drug development targeting PEX3, and for the analysis of additional partners involved in this crucial step of glycosome biogenesis.

Abstract: In the present work, different hybrid perovskites were synthesized by gradual concentration variation of larger cation of phenylammoniumiodide (PAI) and methylammoniumiodide (MAI) in PbI2 solution with the aim of improving the stability of MAPbI3 film and photovoltaic efficiency. To understand the properties of perovskite like structural, optical, thermal, morphological and chemical state, extensive characterizations such as XRD, UV–visible spectroscopy, FE-SEM, SEM, EDX and XPS were performed. The role of PAI was investigated further with the use of DFT studies. The DFT results confirmed that the PAI was passivated on the surface of MAPbI3 with most stable arrangement. The stable arrangement revealed the formation of ᴫ-ᴫ interactions within the phenyl rings, which shielded the MAI crystals and thereby resulted in enhanced stability of the perovskites. Highly protected perovskite consequently yielded high- performance solar cell device with enhanced stability under 60% humidity, high temperature exposure and longer time stability even when directly exposed to normal room temperature. The new investigation of capping techniques with the use of bigger organic molecules, high performance solar cell with low device costs could emerge. This could lead to unprecedented rapid progress on power conversion efficiency (PCE). Thus, more stable organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites could be developed for future applications.

Abstract: Steam generation by efficient utilization of solar energy is a promising strategy in seawater desalination and industrial wastewater treatment. Daikon, a cheap and scaled available crop, was chosen as raw material which was subjected to a carbonization process. The carbonized daikon possesses highly developed honeycomb cellular structure providing numerous interconnected channels. The close-packed pores act as photon traps leading to enhanced solar absorption of more than 95.5% in the visible region and more than 93.5% in the near infrared region. The excellent hydrophilic nature and the interconnected channels of the carbonized daikon provide strong capillary force for the quick transport of water. As a result, under one-sun irradiation, the carbonized daikon delivers a water evaporation rate of 1.57 kg m−2 h−1 and a solar steam efficiency of 85.9%. The carbonized daikon also shows great performance toward water evaporation from seawater and contaminated water, realizing the separation of water from pollutants and indicating its application versatility.

Abstract: The design of sub-wavelength structure with full-spectrum near-unity solar absorption is a long-sought-after goal of crucial importance for optoelectronic materials and technology. To date, numerous attempts to tackle this problem consisted either of using stronger absorption-but narrowband or the broader spectrum-but moderate light trapping mechanisms. Herein, a novel strategy that achieves perfect absorption for solar energy in the full-spectrum range of the sun's radiance is presented by the thin-film refractory metal resonators. This impressive absorption mainly stems from the cooperative effect of strong plasmonic resonances and the intrinsic broadband spectral responses by the refractory metals, such as Ti, V, W, etc. The full-spectrum weighted solar absorption efficiency is exceeding 98%, showing a near-unity light trapping for the sun's radiation. Moreover, excellent thermal emitting with the spectral averaged efficiency ~ 91% is achieved in the wavelength range (280–4000 nm) by the W-based absorber, suggesting a platform for near-perfect blackbody emitting source. More importantly, the investigations on achieving full-spectrum solar absorbers and thermal emitters provide new insight on the mechanism and philosophy for the design. Just like the proverb, in order to catch bandits, the first thing is to catch the ringleader. As for the purpose of achieving full-spectrum near-unity absorbers or radiators, the key point is to perfectly trap or excite the solar/thermal power in the main distribution ranges for the sunlight or the blackbody radiation. Accordingly, these attractive properties and findings suggest that the investigation and the related full-spectrum solar absorbers and blackbody radiator might have promising applications in the fields related to energy harvesting and conversion.

Abstract: Nanocomposite thin films of tin sulfide (SnS) with graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were prepared by spray deposition of tin sulfide nanocolloids mixed with graphene oxide. SnS nanocolloidal suspensions were synthesized by liquid phase pulsed laser ablation of a SnS target in isopropyl alcohol and dimethyl formamide. Spherical morphology and orthorhombic crystalline structure of the nanoparticles were determined by transmission electron microscopy. Graphene oxide was synthesized through a chemical pathway (Marcano's method) and was mixed with SnS nanocolloid. Thin films were deposited by spraying SnS nanocolloid as well as the GO mixed SnS on heated substrates. The thin films were post-annealed under vacuum to form reduced graphene oxide. Structure, morphology and optoelectronic properties of thin films formed at various conditions were determined by different techniques. Scanning electron micrographs showed porous film surface with GO/rGO net-like structures embedded in SnS nanoparticles. Photocurrent measurements at different illumination wavelengths and cyclic voltammetry using SnS:rGO as working electrodes showed improvement in the properties of graphene oxide incorporated SnS. A solar cell was fabricated using SnS:rGO thin film and the results obtained are promising.

Abstract: Plants rely on a sophisticated innate immune system to recognize pathogens and defend against pathogen attacks. The immune system must be precisely regulated to be capable of mounting a strong and effective defense response while avoiding autoimmunity. Targeted protein degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) plays crucial roles in both negative and positive regulations of immunity. In the absence of pathogens, the UPS targets immune receptors and downstream signaling components to maintain their homeostasis. Following pathogen recognition, UPS activity is also required for immune signaling and defense responses. Here we provide an overview of the diverse components of the UPS known to affect plant immunity.

Abstract: Solar cell wafer industry is classified as one of the most complex electronic industries that produces a significant proportion of waste in the form of broken/damaged cells or cells having some defects in their chemical composition that can generally be called Rejected Solar Cell Wafers (RSCWs). Although these wastes contain valuable metals (e.g. Silver (Ag), Aluminum (Al), and Silicon (Si)), unfortunately there is currently no obvious strategy for recovery of these metals and landfilling is considered the primary option for their disposal what can lead to serious soil contamination and human health risks if the waste is not treated properly. This research aims to develop an integrated technology to recover all these metals as high added value nano/micro products with total recovery rate > 98%, thus achieving the sustainability and goals of circular economy. Milling process was used as a pretreatment to break the chemical and mechanical bonds between Ag electrodes, Al electrode, and Si layer of RSCW samples to increase the surface area for reaction. The pretreatment was followed by leaching process using Nitric Acid (HNO3) with concentration > 60% to dissolve Ag and break the chemical bonds between spherical Al microparticles in the Al paste layer. Thus the particles were separated and only a small amount of the Al was dissolved from the surface of the particles since due to the high concentration of HNO3 passivation of Al occurred, forming a thin layer from Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3) that prevented the further dissolution of Al. Under the effect of soundwaves, the separated particles began splitting further and exfoliate into Al nanocrystals. After that, micro-filtration process was used to extract Si microparticles from the leached solution and the extracted particles were purified by etching process using Hydrofluoric acid (HF) to remove Silicon Nitride contamination. Centrifugal process was used to separate Al nanocrystals from the leached solution. Finally, Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was added to the remaining saturated solution to recover AgCl. SEM-EDS, FTIR, ICP, XRD, and TEM were used to analyze and examine the selected wafers and recovered materials. Also, the economic performance, sustainability, and CO2 emissions of the advanced technology were evaluated.

Abstract: In the past few decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have gained great progress. And fullerene PSCs occupy a dominant position in the early stage of the development of PSCs. Recently, non-fullerene PSCs have gained more attention because of their advantages, such as good absorption in the visible and near infra-red (NIR) region, high tunability of energy levels, better complementary absorption spectra with donors. Thus, numerous efforts have focused on the synthesis and modulation of small molecular acceptor (SMAs). And lots of non-fullerene PSCs have achieved higher power conversion efficiencies than fullerene PSCs. This short review focuses on the progress of non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors for high efficiency PSCs in recent years. And it would provide new ideas for designing high efficiency PSCs.

Abstract: Sn doped TiO2 aggregates have been successfully prepared via one pot hydrothermal technique. Different methods were used to characterize prepared Sn doped TiO2 aggregates such as DRX, XPS, N2 adsorption (BET), FEGSEM and UV–Vis spectroscopy. It was illustrated that the size, the morphology and the phase of prepared TiO2 aggregates is strongly influenced by the amount of added Sn doping. In addition, it was demonstrated that the prepared aggregates properties is influenced by the synthesis temperature. Furthermore, it was shown that the prepared Sn doped TiO2 aggregates are of high crystallinity. The influence of added Sn dopant amount on the optical and structural properties of the prepared Sn doped TiO2 aggregates have been investigated.

The influence of ricin-mediated rRNA depurination on the translational machinery in vivo - New insight into ricin toxicity,

Abstract: The generally accepted model of ricin intoxication assumes that direct inactivation of ribosomes by depurination of a specific adenine residue within the sarcin-ricin-loop (SRL) on the 60S ribosomal subunit is a major source of its toxicity. The model proposes that SRL depurination leads to protein synthesis inhibition, evoking ribotoxic stress with concomitant induction of numerous metabolic pathways, which lead to cell death. However, the direct relationship between the depurination and its impact on the translational machinery in vivo has never been satisfactorily explained. In this work, we approached a long-standing question about the influence of SRL depurination on the functioning of the translational machinery in vivo. We have shown that an already low level of depurinated ribosomes exert an effect on cell metabolism, indicating that minute modification within the ribosomal pool is sufficient to elicit a toxic effect. Importantly, depurination does not affect notably any particular step of translation, and translational slowdown caused by ricin is not a direct consequence of depurination and cannot be considered as the sole source of cell death. Instead, SRL depurination in a small fraction of ribosomes blocks cell cycle progression with no effect on cell viability. In this work, we have provided a comprehensive picture of the impact of SRL depurination on the translational apparatus in vivo. We propose that ribosomes with depurinated SRL represent a small imprinted ribosomal pool, which generates a specific signal for the cell to halt the cell cycle.

Abstract: A photodetector based on Mg/ZnSnP2/Sn structure was fabricated on p-type silicon (100) to operate in the wavelength range of 450–850 nm. The observed current-voltage characteristics showed roll-over like features which was successfully modeled considering two Schottky junction diodes connected back to back. The device showed strong photo-response in both the forward and reverse bias configuration and the current-voltage curve shifted to the fourth quadrant under illumination. The barrier height and the ideality factor of the two Schottky diodes were evaluated using numerical simulation. The maximum values of responsivity, photosensitivity and detectivity were found to be 22.76 mA W−1, 57.00 cm2W‐1 and 6.34 × 1010 cm Hz1/2 W−1 in the forward bias and 3.48 mA W−1, 48.22 cm2 W−1 and 2.25 × 1010 cm Hz1/2 W−1 in the reverse bias, respectively at illumination of wavelength 850 nm. The photodetector showed a fast response time of 47 μs and multiple recovery times of 725 μs, 1.2 ms and 1.3 ms respectively. The existence of traps within the ZnSnP2 thin films was responsible for extending the time of recovery in comparison to time of response.

Abstract: The p53 tumor suppressor regulates expression of genes involved in various stress responses. Upon genotoxic stress, p53 induces target genes regulating cell cycle arrest for survival or apoptosis. Nevertheless, detailed mechanisms of how p53 selectively regulates these opposing outcomes remain unclear. For this study, we investigated p53 regulatory mechanisms exerted by nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1 (NAP1L1) and NAP1L4, both of which are identified as DGKζ-interacting proteins. Here we demonstrate that, under normal conditions, NAP1L1 knockdown decreases Lys320 acetylation of p53 with attenuated proarrest p21 expression, whereas NAP1L4 knockdown increases Lys320 acetylation with enhanced p21 expression. These conditions lead respectively to facilitation and suppression of cell growth. Under genotoxic stress conditions, NAP1L1 knockdown increases Lys382 acetylation with enhanced proapoptotic Bax levels, thereby facilitating cell death. By contrast, NAP1L4 knockdown decreases Lys382 acetylation with attenuated Bax levels, thereby suppressing apoptosis. These results suggest that NAP1L1 and NAP1L4 regulate cell fate by controlling the expression of p53-responsive proarrest and proapoptotic genes through selective modulation of p53 acetylation at specific sites during normal homeostasis and in stress-induced responses.

Abstract: Construction materials play a crucial role in the thermal behaviour of the urban space as well as the building energy consumption and indoor environmental quality. Recently, there has been growing interest in optical construction materials/coatings as an effective method to minimise energy use, improve indoor and outdoor thermal comfort and fight urban overheating. Thermochromic materials as one of the advanced optical materials that change their optical properties/colour as a function of the ambient temperature can present lower/higher surface temperature than conventional materials during the warm/cold periods. Although pilot applications of thermochromic materials in the built environment shown a tremendous energy conservation potential, the serious optical degradation they exhibited, restricts seriously their use. Recent development in the field of thermochromic materials including quantum dots, plasmonics, photonic crystals, conjugated polymers, Schiff bases, liquid crystals, and nano optical filters for Leuco dyes present fascinating and impressive characteristics, enhance significantly the potential of thermochromic materials and opens new opportunities for the development and use of advanced cutting-edge optical materials. The present paper aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the recent developments on advanced thermochromic materials and on their energy conservation potential.

Abstract: Background
We previously reported that co-transplantation of exosomes from hypoxia-preconditioned adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) improves the neoangiogenesis and survival of the grafted tissue. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of this protective effect.
Methods
Exosomes were collected from normoxia-treated (nADSC-Exo) or hypoxia--treated (hypADSC-Exo) human ADSCs, and their pro-angiogenic capacity was evaluated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a nude mouse model of subcutaneous fat grafting. Protein array was used to compare the exosome-derived proteins between nADSC-Exo and hypADSC-Exo.
Results
Compared with the nADSC-Exo group and untreated control, hypADSC-Exo treatment significantly promoted proliferation, migration and tube-formation capability of HUVECs. Protein array revealed that the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and their receptors (VEGF-R2, VEGF-R3), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2), monocyte chemoattractant protein 4 (MCP-4) were significantly higher in the hypADSC-Exo than in the nADSC-Exo. In the nude mice model of fat grafting, immunofluorescence of CD31 showed that hypADSC-Exo dramatically improved neovascularization around the graft. Furthermore, compared with nADSC-Exo and control groups, cotransplantation of hypADSC-Exo significantly increased the protein expression of EGF, FGF, VEGF/VEGF-R, angiopoietin-1(Ang-1) and tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 1(Tie-1, an angiopoietin receptor) in the grafted tissue at 30 days after transplantation. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that hypADSC-Exo treatment significantly increased VEGF-R expression in the grafted tissue.
Conclusions
Exosomes from hypoxia-treated human ADSCs possess a higher capacity to enhance angiogenesis in fat grafting, at least partially, via regulating VEGF/VEGF-R signaling.

Abstract: This work reports a study on sputter coated iridium oxide film as a counter electrode (CE) for the electrochemical catalysis of tetramethylthiourea/tetramethylformaminium disulfide (TMTU/TMFDS2+) redox reaction in electrochromic (EC) devices. The iridium oxide (IrOx) with the thickness of about 5 nm coated onto transparent conductive oxide, e.g., fluorine-doped tin oxide (F:SnO2), has shown excellent catalytic properties and excellent electrochromic cycling stability in EC device. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results revealed that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) is mainly influenced by the oxygen flow rate during the sputtering process, and by the layer thickness. The IrOX films coated with low oxygen flow rate has shown a lower charge transfer resistance compared to the fully oxidized iridium oxide film. However, sub-stoichiometric layers are less transparent, and therefore less appropriate for the application. In this regard, fully oxidized and highly transparent (Tvisible = 86%) layer formed by the sputtering process at or above 50 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute) flow of oxygen having the thickness of 5 nm is used in EC devices. These layers have the Rct of 25 Ω cm2 at 1 V bias voltage for the redox electrolytes. The cyclic voltammetry technique has shown a typical quasi-reversible nature of redox electrolyte at the same IrOx coated electrode. An electrochromic test for 550 cycles demonstrates that 5 nm of IrOx is sufficient for the stabile EC window with TMTU/TMFDS2+ electrolyte.

Abstract: The application of the model of independent diodes with an effective series resistance in units of Ωcm2 leads to wrong predictions of the local diode voltages in solar cells, if their dark current is strongly inhomogeneous. Therefore, multicrystalline solar cells should be modelled by finite element methods such as that implemented in Griddler. Until now, the local parameters for this modelling were obtained for inhomogeneous solar cells by evaluating luminescence and dark lock-in thermography (DLIT) images. The inhomogeneous local diode parameters, in particular the saturation current density J01, were obtained by the DLIT-based analysis (Local I-V), and the local emitter contact resistances were obtained by evaluating luminescence-based local diode voltages. This method, however, is experimentally demanding and shows a limited spatial resolution due to thermal blurring of the DLIT results. Previous luminescence-based methods for imaging J01, based on the model of independent diodes, have been found to be erroneous. In this model it is assumed that each elementary cell region (image pixel) is connected to the terminals of the cell by an independent series resistance (Trupke et al., 2007) [1]. Meanwhile alternative luminescence evaluation methods are available for reliably imaging J01 with high spatial resolution. This opens the way for a purely luminescence-based finite element simulation of inhomogeneous solar cells. In this contribution this method is described and applied to a multicrystalline PERC cell made from high performance silicon material. The results are compared to that of a luminescence plus DLIT based evaluation.

Abstract: The eukaryotic genome is compacted in the form of chromatin within the nucleus. Whether the spatial distribution of the genome is ordered or not has been a longstanding question. Answering this question would enable us to understand nuclear organization and cellular processes more deeply. Here, we applied a modified CRISPR/dCas9 system to label the randomly selected genomic loci in diploid living cells, which were visualized by high-resolution wide-field imaging. To analyze the spatial positions of three pairs of genomic loci, three sets of parameters were progressively measured: i) the linear distance between alleles; ii) the radial distribution of the genomic loci; and iii) the linear distances between three pairs of genomic loci on nonhomologous chromosomes. By accurate labeling, geometric measuring and statistical analysis, we demonstrated that the distribution of these genomic loci in the 3D space of the nucleus is relatively stable in both late G1 and early S phases. Collectively, our data provided visual evidence in live cells, which implies the orderly spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus. The combination of orderliness and flexibility ensures the methodical and efficient operation of complex life systems. How the nucleus adopts this ordered 3D structure in living cells is thought-provoking.
