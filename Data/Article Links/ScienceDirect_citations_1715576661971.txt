Abstract: Summary
Microglia are versatile regulators in brain development and disorders. Emerging evidence links microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation to microglial function; however, the exact underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover the enrichment of miR-137, a neuropsychiatric-disorder-associated miRNA, in the microglial nucleus, and reveal its unexpected nuclear functions in maintaining the microglial global transcriptomic state, phagocytosis, and inflammatory response. Mechanistically, microglial Mir137 deletion increases chromatin accessibility, which contains binding motifs for the microglial master transcription factor Pu.1. Through biochemical and bioinformatics analyses, we propose that miR-137 modulates Pu.1-mediated gene expression by suppressing Pu.1 binding to chromatin. Importantly, we find that increased Pu.1 binding upregulates the target gene Jdp2 (Jun dimerization protein 2) and that knockdown of Jdp2 significantly suppresses the impaired phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory response in Mir137 knockout microglia. Collectively, our study provides evidence supporting the notion that nuclear miR-137 acts as a transcriptional modulator and that this microglia-specific function is essential for maintaining normal adult brain function.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known of the brain mechanisms that mediate sex-specific autism symptoms. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-risk gene, Pten, in neocortical pyramidal neurons (NSEPten knockout [KO]) results in robust cortical circuit hyperexcitability selectively in female mice observed as prolonged spontaneous persistent activity states. Circuit hyperexcitability in females is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) signaling to mitogen-activated protein kinases (Erk1/2) and de novo protein synthesis. Pten KO layer 5 neurons have a female-specific increase in mGluR5 and mGluR5-dependent protein synthesis. Furthermore, mGluR5-ERα complexes are generally elevated in female cortices, and genetic reduction of ERα rescues enhanced circuit excitability, protein synthesis, and neuron size selectively in NSEPten KO females. Female NSEPten KO mice display deficits in sensory processing and social behaviors as well as mGluR5-dependent seizures. These results reveal mechanisms by which sex and a high-confidence ASD-risk gene interact to affect brain function and behavior.

Abstract: Summary
When exposed to sensory sequences, do macaque monkeys spontaneously form abstract internal models that generalize to novel experiences? Here, we show that neuronal populations in macaque ventrolateral prefrontal cortex jointly encode visual sequences by separate codes for the specific pictures presented and for their abstract sequential structure. We recorded prefrontal neurons while macaque monkeys passively viewed visual sequences and sequence mismatches in the local-global paradigm. Even without any overt task or response requirements, prefrontal populations spontaneously form representations of sequence structure, serial order, and image identity within distinct but superimposed neuronal subspaces. Representations of sequence structure rapidly update following single exposure to a mismatch sequence, while distinct populations represent mismatches for sequences of different complexity. Finally, those representations generalize across sequences following the same repetition structure but comprising different images. These results suggest that prefrontal populations spontaneously encode rich internal models of visual sequences reflecting both content-specific and abstract information.

Abstract: Summary
Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes iteratively oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to generate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine to facilitate active genome demethylation. Whether these bases are required to promote replication-coupled dilution or activate base excision repair during mammalian germline reprogramming remains unresolved due to the inability to decouple TET activities. Here, we generated two mouse lines expressing catalytically inactive TET1 (Tet1-HxD) and TET1 that stalls oxidation at 5hmC (Tet1-V). Tet1 knockout and catalytic mutant primordial germ cells (PGCs) fail to erase methylation at select imprinting control regions and promoters of meiosis-associated genes, validating the requirement for the iterative oxidation of 5mC for complete germline reprogramming. TET1V and TET1HxD rescue most hypermethylation of Tet1−/− sperm, suggesting the role of TET1 beyond its oxidative capability. We additionally identify a broader class of hypermethylated regions in Tet1 mutant mouse sperm that depend on TET oxidation for reprogramming. Our study demonstrates the link between TET1-mediated germline reprogramming and sperm methylome patterning.

Abstract: Background/purpose
Nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA)/ gel porous scaffolds loaded with WSM carriers are promising bone replacement materials that can improve osseointegration ability. This investigation aimed to evaluate the osteoinductive activity by implanting the composition of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA)/ Gel porous scaffolds as a carrier of WSM via an animal model. Materials and methods: WSM was extracted and nHA was added to the matrix to construct porous composite scaffolds. The dose-effect curve of WSM concentration and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was made by culturing rat osteoblasts and examining the absorbance. Three different materials were implanted into critical size defects (CSD) in the skulls of rats, which were further divided into four groups: WSM nHA /Gel group, n-WSM nHA /Gel group, HA powder group, and control group. Results: WSM (150 μg/mL-250μg/mL) effectively improved the activity of ALP in rat osteoblasts. All rats in each group had normal healing. WSM-loaded nHA /Gel group showed better performance on newly-formed bone tissue of rat skull and back at 4th week and 8th week, respectively. At the 4th week, the network of woven bone formed in the WSM-loaded nHA/Gel scaffold material. At 8th week, the reticular trabecular bone in the WSM-loaded scaffold material became dense lamellar bone, and the defect was mature lamellar bone. In the subcutaneous implantation experiment, WSM-loaded nHA/Gel scaffold material showed a better performance of heterotopic ossification than the pure nHA/Gel scaffold material. Conclusion: WSM promotes osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization. The results confirm that the nHA/ Gel Porous Scaffold with Nacre Water-Soluble Matrix has a significant bone promoting effect and can be used as a choice for tissue engineering to repair bone defects.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin structure is regulated through posttranslational modifications of histone variants that modulate transcription. Although highly homologous, histone variants display unique amino acid sequences associated with specific functions. Abnormal incorporation of histone variants contributes to cancer initiation, therapy resistance, and metastasis. This study reports that, among its biologic functions, histone H3.1 serves as a chromatin redox sensor that is engaged by mitochondrial H2O2. In breast cancer cells, the oxidation of H3.1Cys96 promotes its eviction and replacement by H3.3 in specific promoters. We also report that this process facilitates the opening of silenced chromatin domains and transcriptional activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal genes associated with cell plasticity. Scavenging nuclear H2O2 or amino acid substitution of H3.1(C96S) suppresses plasticity, restores sensitivity to chemotherapy, and induces remission of metastatic lesions. Hence, it appears that increased levels of H2O2 produced by mitochondria of breast cancer cells directly promote redox-regulated H3.1-dependent chromatin remodeling involved in chemoresistance and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial invasions underlie host-microbe interactions resulting in pathogenesis and probiotic colonization. In this study, we explore the effects of the microbiome on microbial invasion in Drosophila melanogaster. We demonstrate that gut microbes Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Acetobacter tropicalis improve survival and lead to a reduction in microbial burden during infection. Using a microbial interaction assay, we report that L. plantarum inhibits the growth of invasive bacteria, while A. tropicalis reduces this inhibition. We further show that inhibition by L. plantarum is linked to its ability to acidify its environment via lactic acid production by lactate dehydrogenase, while A. tropicalis diminishes the inhibition by quenching acids. We propose that acid from the microbiome is a gatekeeper to microbial invasions, as only microbes capable of tolerating acidic environments can colonize the host. The methods and findings described herein will add to the growing breadth of tools to study microbe-microbe interactions in broad contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis damages proteostasis, affecting spinal and upper motor neurons earlier than a subset of cranial motor neurons. To aid disease understanding, we exposed induced cranial and spinal motor neurons (iCrMNs and iSpMNs) to proteotoxic stress, under which iCrMNs showed superior survival, quantifying the transcriptome and proteome for >8,200 genes at 0, 12, and 36 h. Two-thirds of the proteome showed cell-type differences. iSpMN-enriched proteins related to DNA/RNA metabolism, and iCrMN-enriched proteins acted in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ER chaperone complex, tRNA aminoacylation, mitochondria, and the plasma/synaptic membrane, suggesting that iCrMNs expressed higher levels of proteins supporting proteostasis and neuronal function. When investigating the increased proteasome levels in iCrMNs, we showed that the activity of the 26S proteasome, but not of the 20S proteasome, was higher in iCrMNs than in iSpMNs, even after a stress-induced decrease. We identified Ublcp1 as an iCrMN-specific regulator of the nuclear 26S activity.

Abstract: Summary
Intratumor morphological heterogeneity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) predicts clinical outcomes but is only partially understood at the molecular level. To elucidate the gene expression programs underpinning intratumor morphological variation in PDAC, we investigated and deconvoluted at single cell level the molecular profiles of histologically distinct clusters of PDAC cells. We identified three major morphological and functional variants that co-exist in varying proportions in all PDACs, display limited genetic diversity, and are associated with a distinct organization of the extracellular matrix: a glandular variant with classical ductal features; a transitional variant displaying abortive ductal structures and mixed endodermal and myofibroblast-like gene expression; and a poorly differentiated variant lacking ductal features and basement membrane, and showing neuronal lineage priming. Ex vivo and in vitro evidence supports the occurrence of dynamic transitions among these variants in part influenced by extracellular matrix composition and stiffness and associated with local, specifically neural, invasion.

Abstract: Summary
Over the last decade, multiple studies have investigated the heterogeneity of murine conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2s). However, their phenotypic similarity with monocytes and macrophages renders their clear identification challenging. By creating a protein atlas utilizing multiparameter flow cytometry, we show that ESAM+ cDC2s are a specialized feature of the spleen strongly differing in their proteome from other cDC2s. In contrast, all other tissues are populated by Clec12A+ cDC2s or Clec12A− cDC2s (high or low for Fcγ receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and CD11b, respectively), rendering Clec12A+ cDC2s classical sentinels. Further, expression analysis of CD301b, Clec12A, and FcγRIIB/III provides a conserved definition of cDC2 heterogeneity, including the discovery of putative FcγRIIB/III+ DC3s across tissues. Finally, our data reveal that cell identity (ontogeny) dictates the proteome that is further fine-tuned by the tissue environment on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), while monocytes and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) display subset intrinsic default settings.

Abstract: Summary
T cell infiltration into white adipose tissue (WAT) drives obesity-induced adipose inflammation, but the mechanisms of obesity-induced T cell infiltration into WAT remain unclear. Our single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a significant impact of adipose stem cells (ASCs) on T cells. Transplanting ASCs from obese mice into WAT enhances T cell accumulation. C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) is upregulated in ASCs as early as 4 weeks of high-fat diet feeding, coinciding with the onset of T cell infiltration into WAT during obesity. ASCs and bone marrow transplantation experiments demonstrate that CCL5 from ASCs plays a crucial role in T cell accumulation during obesity. The production of CCL5 in ASCs is induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha via the nuclear factor κB pathway. Overall, our findings underscore the pivotal role of ASCs in regulating T cell accumulation in WAT during the early phases of obesity, emphasizing their importance in modulating adaptive immunity in obesity-induced adipose inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing is limited by the technical challenges to examining spliceosomes in vivo. Here, we report the isolation of RNP complexes derived from precatalytic A or B-like spliceosomes solubilized from the chromatin pellet of mammalian cell nuclei. We found that these complexes contain U2 snRNP proteins and a portion of the U2 snRNA bound with protected RNA fragments that precisely map to intronic branch sites across the transcriptome. These U2 complexes also contained the splicing regulators RBM5 and RBM10. We found RBM5 and RBM10 bound to nearly all branch site complexes and not simply those at regulated exons. The deletion of a conserved RBM5/RBM10 peptide sequence, including a zinc finger motif, disrupted U2 interaction and rendered the proteins inactive for the repression of many alternative exons. We propose a model where RBM5 and RBM10 regulate splicing as components of the U2 snRNP complex following branch site base pairing.

Abstract: Summary
Predictive modeling of macromolecular recognition and protein-protein complementarity represents one of the cornerstones of biophysical sciences. However, such models are often hindered by the combinatorial complexity of interactions at the molecular interfaces. Exemplary of this problem is peptide presentation by the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecule, a principal component of immune recognition. We developed human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Inception, a deep biophysical convolutional neural network, which integrates molecular electrostatics to capture non-bonded interactions for predicting peptide binding motifs across 5,821 MHC-I alleles. These predictions of generated motifs correlate strongly with experimental peptide binding and presentation data. Beyond molecular interactions, the study demonstrates the application of predicted motifs in analyzing MHC-I allele associations with HIV disease progression and patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic β cells actively respond to glucose fluctuations through regulating insulin processing and secretion. However, how this process is elaborately tuned in circumstance of variable microenvironments as well as β cell-intrinsic states and whether its dysfunction links to metabolic diseases remain largely elusive. Here, we show that the cytosolic pH (pHc) in β cells is increased upon glucose challenge, which can be sensed by Smad5 via its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Lesion of Smad5 in β cells results in hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance due to insulin processing and secretion deficiency. The role of Smad5 in regulating insulin processing and secretion attributes to its non-canonical function by regulating V-ATPase activity for granule acidification. Genetic mutation of Smad5 or administration of alkaline water to mirror cytosolic alkalization ameliorated glucose intolerance in high-fat diet (HFD)-treated mice. Collectively, our findings suggest that pHc is a direct nexus in linking environmental cues with insulin processing and secretion in β cells.

Abstract: Summary
The relationship between sensory stimuli and perceptions is brain-state dependent: in wakefulness, suprathreshold stimuli evoke perceptions; under anesthesia, perceptions are abolished; and during dreaming and in dissociated states, percepts are internally generated. Here, we exploit this state dependence to identify brain activity associated with internally generated or stimulus-evoked perceptions. In awake mice, visual stimuli phase reset spontaneous cortical waves to elicit 3–6 Hz feedback traveling waves. These stimulus-evoked waves traverse the cortex and entrain visual and parietal neurons. Under anesthesia as well as during ketamine-induced dissociation, visual stimuli do not disrupt spontaneous waves. Uniquely, in the dissociated state, spontaneous waves traverse the cortex caudally and entrain visual and parietal neurons, akin to stimulus-evoked waves in wakefulness. Thus, coordinated neuronal assemblies orchestrated by traveling cortical waves emerge in states in which perception can manifest. The awake state is privileged in that this coordination is reliably elicited by external visual stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
The topological state of chromosomes determines their mechanical properties, dynamics, and function. Recent work indicated that interphase chromosomes are largely free of entanglements. Here, we use Hi-C, polymer simulations, and multi-contact 3C and find that, by contrast, mitotic chromosomes are self-entangled. We explore how a mitotic self-entangled state is converted into an unentangled interphase state during mitotic exit. Most mitotic entanglements are removed during anaphase/telophase, with remaining ones removed during early G1, in a topoisomerase-II-dependent process. Polymer models suggest a two-stage disentanglement pathway: first, decondensation of mitotic chromosomes with remaining condensin loops produces entropic forces that bias topoisomerase II activity toward decatenation. At the second stage, the loops are released, and the formation of new entanglements is prevented by lower topoisomerase II activity, allowing the establishment of unentangled and territorial G1 chromosomes. When mitotic entanglements are not removed in experiments and models, a normal interphase state cannot be acquired.

Abstract: Summary
Homeostatic regulation of synapses is vital for nervous system function and key to understanding a range of neurological conditions. Synaptic homeostasis is proposed to operate over hours to counteract the destabilizing influence of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). The prevailing view holds that synaptic scaling is a slow first-order process that regulates postsynaptic glutamate receptors and fundamentally differs from LTP or LTD. Surprisingly, we find that the dynamics of scaling induced by neuronal inactivity are not exponential or monotonic, and the mechanism requires calcineurin and CaMKII, molecules dominant in LTD and LTP. Our quantitative model of these enzymes reconstructs the unexpected dynamics of homeostatic scaling and reveals how synapses can efficiently safeguard future capacity for synaptic plasticity. This mechanism of synaptic adaptation supports a broader set of homeostatic changes, including action potential autoregulation, and invites further inquiry into how such a mechanism varies in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
CD24 is frequently overexpressed in ovarian cancer and promotes immune evasion by interacting with its receptor Siglec10, present on tumor-associated macrophages, providing a “don’t eat me” signal that prevents targeting and phagocytosis by macrophages. Factors promoting CD24 expression could represent novel immunotherapeutic targets for ovarian cancer. Here, using a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen, we identify GPAA1 (glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment 1), a factor that catalyzes the attachment of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchor to substrate proteins, as a positive regulator of CD24 cell surface expression. Genetic ablation of GPAA1 abolishes CD24 cell surface expression, enhances macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, and inhibits ovarian tumor growth in mice. GPAA1 shares structural similarities with aminopeptidases. Consequently, we show that bestatin, a clinically advanced aminopeptidase inhibitor, binds to GPAA1 and blocks GPI attachment, resulting in reduced CD24 cell surface expression, increased macrophage-mediated phagocytosis, and suppressed growth of ovarian tumors. Our study highlights the potential of targeting GPAA1 as an immunotherapeutic approach for CD24+ ovarian cancers.

Abstract: Summary
GFRAL-expressing neurons actuate aversion and nausea, are targets for obesity treatment, and may mediate metformin effects by long-term GDF15-GFRAL agonism. Whether GFRAL+ neurons acutely regulate glucose and energy homeostasis is, however, underexplored. Here, we report that cell-specific activation of GFRAL+ neurons using a variety of techniques causes a torpor-like state, including hypothermia, the release of stress hormones, a shift from glucose to lipid oxidation, and impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and skeletal muscle glucose uptake but augmented glucose uptake in visceral fat. Metabolomic analysis of blood and transcriptomics of muscle and fat indicate alterations in ketogenesis, insulin signaling, adipose tissue differentiation and mitogenesis, and energy fluxes. Our findings indicate that acute GFRAL+ neuron activation induces endocrine and gluco- and thermoregulatory responses associated with nausea and torpor. While chronic activation of GFRAL signaling promotes weight loss in obesity, these results show that acute activation of GFRAL+ neurons causes hypothermia and hyperglycemia.

Abstract: Summary
The multi-domain protein UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains, 1) recruits DNMT1 for DNA methylation maintenance during DNA replication. Here, we show that MOF (males absent on the first) acetylates UHRF1 at K670 in the pre-RING linker region, whereas HDAC1 deacetylates UHRF1 at the same site. We also identify that K667 and K668 can also be acetylated by MOF when K670 is mutated. The MOF/HDAC1-mediated acetylation in UHRF1 is cell-cycle regulated and peaks at G1/S phase, in line with the function of UHRF1 in recruiting DNMT1 to maintain DNA methylation. In addition, UHRF1 acetylation significantly enhances its E3 ligase activity. Abolishing UHRF1 acetylation at these sites attenuates UHRF1-mediated H3 ubiquitination, which in turn impairs DNMT1 recruitment and DNA methylation. Taken together, these findings identify MOF as an acetyltransferase for UHRF1 and define a mechanism underlying the regulation of DNA methylation maintenance through MOF-mediated UHRF1 acetylation.

Abstract: Summary
The host-microbiota relationship has evolved to shape mammalian physiology, including immunity, metabolism, and development. Germ-free models are widely used to study microbial effects on host processes such as immunity. Here, we find that both germ-free and T cell-deficient mice exhibit a robust sebum secretion defect persisting across multiple generations despite microbial colonization and T cell repletion. These phenotypes are inherited by progeny conceived during in vitro fertilization using germ-free sperm and eggs, demonstrating that non-genetic information in the gametes is required for microbial-dependent phenotypic transmission. Accordingly, gene expression in early embryos derived from gametes from germ-free or T cell-deficient mice is strikingly and similarly altered. Our findings demonstrate that microbial- and immune-dependent regulation of non-genetic information in the gametes can transmit inherited phenotypes transgenerationally in mice. This mechanism could rapidly generate phenotypic diversity to enhance host adaptation to environmental perturbations.

Abstract: Summary
Functionalizing materials with biomacromolecules such as enzymes has broad applications in biotechnology and biomedicine. Here, we introduce a grafting method mediated by living cells to functionalize materials. We use polymeric scaffolds to trap engineered bacteria and micron-sized particles with chemical groups serving as active sites for grafting. The bacteria synthesize the desired protein for grafting and autonomously lyse to release it. The released functional moieties are locally grafted onto the active sites, generating the materials engineered by living grafting (MELGs). MELGs are resilient to perturbations because of both the bonding and the regeneration of functional domains synthesized by living cells. The programmability of the bacteria enables us to fabricate MELGs that can respond to external input, decompose a pollutant, reconstitute synthetic pathways for natural product synthesis, and purify mismatched DNA. Our work establishes a bacteria-assisted grafting strategy to functionalize materials with a broad range of biological activities in an integrated, flexible, and modular manner. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) shape tumor immunity and therapeutic efficacy. However, it is poorly understood whether and how post-translational modifications (PTMs) intrinsically affect the phenotype and function of TAMs. Here, we reveal that peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) exhibits the highest expression among common PTM enzymes in TAMs and negatively correlates with the clinical response to immune checkpoint blockade. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PAD4 in macrophages prevents tumor progression in tumor-bearing mouse models, accompanied by an increase in macrophage major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression and T cell effector function. Mechanistically, PAD4 citrullinates STAT1 at arginine 121, thereby promoting the interaction between STAT1 and protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1), and the loss of PAD4 abolishes this interaction, ablating the inhibitory role of PIAS1 in the expression of MHC class II machinery in macrophages and enhancing T cell activation. Thus, the PAD4-STAT1-PIAS1 axis is an immune restriction mechanism in macrophages and may serve as a cancer immunotherapy target.

Abstract: Summary
Perceptual learning improves our ability to interpret sensory stimuli present in our environment through experience. Despite its importance, the underlying mechanisms that enable perceptual learning in our sensory cortices are still not fully understood. In this study, we used in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate the functional and structural changes induced by visual stimulation in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Our results demonstrate that repeated stimulation leads to a refinement of V1 circuitry by decreasing the number of responsive neurons while potentiating their response. At the synaptic level, we observe a reduction in the number of dendritic spines and an overall increase in spine AMPA receptor levels in the same subset of neurons. In addition, visual stimulation induces synaptic potentiation in neighboring spines within individual dendrites. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity underlying information processing in the neocortex.

Abstract: Summary
Spatiotemporal regulation of intracellular signaling molecules, such as the 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA), ensures proper cellular function. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the ubiquitous PKA regulatory subunit RIα promotes cAMP compartmentation and signaling specificity. However, the molecular determinants of RIα LLPS remain unclear. Here, we reveal that two separate dimerization interfaces, combined with the cAMP-induced unleashing of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKA-C) from the pseudosubstrate inhibitory sequence, drive RIα condensate formation in the cytosol of mammalian cells, which is antagonized by docking to A-kinase anchoring proteins. Strikingly, we find that the RIα pseudosubstrate region is critically involved in forming a non-canonical R:C complex, which recruits active PKA-C to RIα condensates to maintain low basal PKA activity in the cytosol. Our results suggest that RIα LLPS not only facilitates cAMP compartmentation but also spatially restrains active PKA-C, thus highlighting the functional versatility of biomolecular condensates in driving signaling specificity.

Abstract: Summary
In pyloric metaplasia, mature gastric chief cells reprogram via an evolutionarily conserved process termed paligenosis to re-enter the cell cycle and become spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM) cells. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) following injury to the murine stomach to analyze mechanisms governing paligenosis at high resolution. Injury causes induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) with coordinated changes in mitochondrial activity and cellular metabolism, requiring the transcriptional mitochondrial regulator Ppargc1a (Pgc1α) and ROS regulator Nf2el2 (Nrf2). Loss of the ROS and mitochondrial control in Ppargc1a−/− mice causes the death of paligenotic cells through ferroptosis. Blocking the cystine transporter SLC7A11(xCT), which is critical in lipid radical detoxification through glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), also increases ferroptosis. Finally, we show that PGC1α-mediated ROS and mitochondrial changes also underlie the paligenosis of pancreatic acinar cells. Altogether, the results detail how metabolic and mitochondrial changes are necessary for injury response, regeneration, and metaplasia in the stomach.

Abstract: Summary
The diversity of CRISPR systems, coupled with scientific ingenuity, has led to an explosion of applications; however, to test newly described innovations in their model systems, researchers typically embark on cumbersome, one-off cloning projects to generate custom reagents that are optimized for their biological questions. Here, we leverage Golden Gate cloning to create the Fragmid toolkit, a modular set of CRISPR cassettes and delivery technologies, along with a web portal, resulting in a combinatorial platform that enables scalable vector assembly within days. We further demonstrate that multiple CRISPR technologies can be assessed in parallel in a pooled screening format using this resource, enabling the rapid optimization of both novel technologies and cellular models. These results establish Fragmid as a robust system for the rapid design of CRISPR vectors, and we anticipate that this assembly approach will be broadly useful for systematic development, comparison, and dissemination of CRISPR technologies.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Periodontitis (PD) is an inflammatory disease with alveolar bone destruction by osteoclasts (OCs). In PD, both inflammation and OC activation are significantly influenced by periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDL-Fib). Yet, whether PDL-Fib has heterogeneity and whether distinct PDL-Fib subsets have specific functions have not been investigated. In this study, we discovered the complexity of PDL-Fib in PD, utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing data from human PD patients. We identified distinct subpopulations of PDL-Fib: one expressing interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and another expressing the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL), both crucial in OC differentiation and bone resorption. In periodontal tissues of mice with PD, active IL-1β, cleaved caspase 1, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor 3 (NLPR3) were significantly elevated, implicating the NLRP3 inflammasome in IL-1β production. Upon stimulation of PDL-Fib with LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), the most well-characterized periodontal bacteria, a more rapid increase in IL-1β, followed by RANKL induction, was observed. IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), another LPS-responsive cytokine, effectively increased RANKL in PDL-Fib, suggesting an indirect effect of pgLPS through IL-1β and TNF-α on RANKL induction. Immunohistological analyses of mouse periodontal tissues also showed markedly elevated levels of IL-1β and RANKL upon PD induction and displayed separate locations of IL-1β-expressing PDL-Fib and RANKL-expressing PDL-Fib in PD. The heterogenic feature of fibroblasts expressing IL-1β and RANKL was also mirrored in our combined cross-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing datasets analysis. In summary, our study elucidates the heterogeneity of PDL-Fib, highlighting distinct functional groups for producing RANKL and IL-1β, which collectively promote OC generation and bone destruction in PD.

Abstract: Summary
Claudin-5 (CLDN5) is an endothelial tight junction protein essential for blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation. Abnormal CLDN5 expression is common in brain disease, and knockdown of Cldn5 at the BBB has been proposed to facilitate drug delivery to the brain. To study the consequences of CLDN5 loss in the mature brain, we induced mosaic endothelial-specific Cldn5 gene ablation in adult mice (Cldn5iECKO). These mice displayed increased BBB permeability to tracers up to 10 kDa in size from 6 days post induction (dpi) and ensuing lethality from 10 dpi. Single-cell RNA sequencing at 11 dpi revealed profound transcriptomic differences in brain endothelial cells regardless of their Cldn5 status in mosaic mice, suggesting major non-cell-autonomous responses. Reactive microglia and astrocytes suggested rapid cellular responses to BBB leakage. Our study demonstrates a critical role for CLDN5 in the adult BBB and provides molecular insight into the consequences and risks associated with CLDN5 inhibition.

Abstract: Cell polarity is crucial for gastric mucosal barrier integrity and mainly regulated by polarity-regulating kinase partitioning-defective 1b (Par1b). During infection, the carcinogen Helicobacter pylori hijacks Par1b via the bacterial oncoprotein CagA leading to loss of cell polarity, but the precise molecular mechanism is not fully clear. Here we discovered a novel function of the actin-binding protein cortactin in regulating Par1b, which forms a complex with cortactin and the tight junction protein zona occludens-1 (ZO-1). We found that serine phosphorylation at S405/418 and the SH3 domain of cortactin are important for its interaction with both Par1b and ZO-1. Cortactin knockout cells displayed disturbed Par1b cellular localization and exhibited morphological abnormalities that largely compromised transepithelial electrical resistance, epithelial cell polarity, and apical microvilli. H. pylori infection promoted cortactin/Par1b/ZO-1 abnormal interactions in the tight junctions in a CagA-dependent manner. Infection of human gastric organoid-derived mucosoids supported these observations. We therefore hypothesize that CagA disrupts gastric epithelial cell polarity by hijacking cortactin, and thus Par1b and ZO-1, suggesting a new signaling pathway for the development of gastric cancer by Helicobacter.

Abstract: Summary
Physiological dysfunction confers negative valence to coincidental sensory cues to induce the formation of aversive associative memory. How peripheral tissue stress engages neuromodulatory mechanisms to form aversive memory is poorly understood. Here, we show that in the nematode C. elegans, mitochondrial disruption induces aversive memory through peroxisomal β-oxidation genes in non-neural tissues, including pmp-4/very-long-chain fatty acid transporter, dhs-28/3-hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and daf-22/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. Upregulation of peroxisomal β-oxidation genes under mitochondrial stress requires the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49. Importantly, the memory-promoting function of peroxisomal β-oxidation is independent of its canonical role in pheromone production. Peripheral signals derived from the peroxisomes target NSM, a critical neuron for memory formation under stress, to upregulate serotonin synthesis and remodel evoked responses to sensory cues. Our genetic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic approaches establish peroxisomal lipid signaling as a crucial mechanism that connects peripheral mitochondrial stress to central serotonin neuromodulation in aversive memory formation.

Abstract: Summary
Plasticity in daily timing of activity has been observed in many species, yet the underlying mechanisms driving nocturnality and diurnality are unknown. By regulating how much wheel-running activity will be rewarded with a food pellet, we can manipulate energy balance and switch mice to be nocturnal or diurnal. Here, we present the rhythmic transcriptome of 21 tissues, including 17 brain regions, sampled every 4 h over a 24-h period from nocturnal and diurnal male CBA/CaJ mice. Rhythmic gene expression across tissues comprised different sets of genes with minimal overlap between nocturnal and diurnal mice. We show that non-clock genes in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) change, and the habenula was most affected. Our results indicate that adaptive flexibility in daily timing of behavior is supported by gene expression dynamics in many tissues and brain regions, especially in the habenula, which suggests a crucial role for the observed nocturnal-diurnal switch.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a transcriptional activator that mediates cellular adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. HIF-1 recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes leading to changes in histone acetylation, citrullination, and methylation at target genes. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible gene expression in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF7 and ER-negative SUM159 human breast cancer cells requires the histone H2A/H2B chaperone facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) and the H2B ubiquitin ligase RING finger protein 20/40 (RNF20/40). Knockdown of FACT or RNF20/40 expression leads to decreased transcription initiation and elongation at HIF-1 target genes. Mechanistically, FACT and RNF20/40 are recruited to hypoxia response elements (HREs) by HIF-1 and stabilize binding of HIF-1 (and each other) at HREs. Hypoxia induces the monoubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120 at HIF-1 target genes in an HIF-1-dependent manner. Together, these findings delineate a cooperative molecular mechanism by which FACT and RNF20/40 stabilize multiprotein complex formation at HREs and mediate histone ubiquitination to facilitate HIF-1 transcriptional activity.

Abstract: Summary
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation deficiency is a common cancer immune escape mechanism, but the mechanistic implications and potential strategies to address this challenge remain poorly understood. Studying β2-microglobulin (B2M) deficient mouse tumor models, we find that MHC class I loss leads to a substantial immune desertification of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and broad resistance to immune-, chemo-, and radiotherapy. We show that treatment with long-lasting mRNA-encoded interleukin-2 (IL-2) restores an immune cell infiltrated, IFNγ-promoted, highly proinflammatory TME signature, and when combined with a tumor-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAB), can overcome therapeutic resistance. Unexpectedly, the effectiveness of this treatment is driven by IFNγ-releasing CD8+ T cells that recognize neoantigens cross-presented by TME-resident activated macrophages. These macrophages acquire augmented antigen presentation proficiency and other M1-phenotype-associated features under IL-2 treatment. Our findings highlight the importance of restoring neoantigen-specific immune responses in the treatment of cancers with MHC class I deficiencies.

Abstract: Strict homeostatic control of pH in both intra- and extracellular compartments of the brain is fundamentally important, primarily due to the profound impact of free protons ([H+]) on neuronal activity and overall brain function. Astrocytes, crucial players in the homeostasis of various ions in the brain, actively regulate their intracellular [H+] (pHi) through multiple membrane transporters and carbonic anhydrases. The activation of astroglial pHi regulating mechanisms also leads to corresponding alterations in the acid-base status of the extracellular fluid. Notably, astrocyte pH regulators are modulated by various neuronal signals, suggesting their pivotal role in regulating brain acid-base balance in both health and disease. This review presents the mechanisms involved in pH regulation in astrocytes and discusses their potential impact on extracellular pH under physiological conditions and in brain disorders. Targeting astrocytic pH regulatory mechanisms represents a promising therapeutic approach for modulating brain acid-base balance in diseases, offering a potential critical contribution to neuroprotection.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an important component of many immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapeutic approaches. However, ICB is not an efficacious strategy in a variety of cancer types, in part due to immunosuppressive metabolites in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we find that αPD-1-resistant cancer cells produce abundant itaconate (ITA) due to enhanced levels of aconitate decarboxylase (Acod1). Acod1 has an important role in the resistance to αPD-1, as decreasing Acod1 levels in αPD-1-resistant cancer cells can sensitize tumors to αPD-1 therapy. Mechanistically, cancer cells with high Acod1 inhibit the proliferation of naive CD8+ T cells through the secretion of inhibitory factors. Surprisingly, inhibition of CD8+ T cell proliferation is not dependent on the secretion of ITA but is instead a consequence of the release of small inhibitory peptides. Our study suggests that strategies to counter the activity of Acod1 in cancer cells may sensitize tumors to ICB therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Epicardial adipose tissue (eAT) is a metabolically active fat depot that has been associated with a wide array of cardiac homeostatic functions and cardiometabolic diseases. A full understanding of its diverse physiological and pathological roles is hindered by the dearth of animal models. Here, we show, in the heart of an ectothermic teleost, the zebrafish, the existence of a fat depot localized underneath the epicardium, originating from the epicardium and exhibiting the molecular signature of beige adipocytes. Moreover, a subset of adipocytes within this cardiac fat tissue exhibits primitive thermogenic potential. Transcriptomic profiling and cross-species analysis revealed elevated glycolytic and cardiac homeostatic gene expression with downregulated obesity and inflammatory hallmarks in the teleost eAT compared to that of lean aged humans. Our findings unveil epicardium-derived beige fat in the heart of an ectotherm considered to possess solely white adipocytes for energy storage and identify pathways that may underlie age-driven remodeling of human eAT.

Abstract: Summary
Osteoclasts play a central role in cancer-cell-induced osteolysis, but the molecular mechanisms of osteoclast activation during bone metastasis formation are incompletely understood. By performing RNA sequencing on a mouse breast carcinoma cell line with higher bone-metastatic potential, here we identify the enzyme CYP11A1 strongly upregulated in osteotropic tumor cells. Genetic deletion of Cyp11a1 in tumor cells leads to a decreased number of bone metastases but does not alter primary tumor growth and lung metastasis formation in mice. The product of CYP11A1 activity, pregnenolone, increases the number and function of mouse and human osteoclasts in vitro but does not alter osteoclast-specific gene expression. Instead, tumor-derived pregnenolone strongly enhances the fusion of pre-osteoclasts via prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit beta (P4HB), identified as a potential interaction partner of pregnenolone. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Cyp11a1-expressing tumor cells produce pregnenolone, which is capable of promoting bone metastasis formation and osteoclast development via P4HB.

Abstract: Summary
Trans-differentiation represents a direct lineage conversion; however, insufficient characterization of this process hinders its potential applications. Here, to explore a potential universal principal for trans-differentiation, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT), endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mouse embryos. We applied three scoring indexes of entropies, cell-type signature transcription factor expression, and critical transition signals to show common features underpinning the fate plasticity of transition states. Cross-model comparison identified inflammatory-featured transition states and a common trigger role of interleukin-33 in promoting fate conversions. Multimodal profiling (integrative transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analysis) demonstrated the inflammatory regulation of hematopoietic specification. Furthermore, multimodal omics and fate-mapping analyses showed that endothelium-specific Spi1, as an inflammatory effector, governs appropriate chromatin accessibility and transcriptional programs to safeguard EHT. Overall, our study employs single-cell omics to identify critical transition states/signals and the common trigger role of inflammatory signaling in developmental-stress-induced fate conversions.

Abstract: Summary
G3BP1/2 are paralogous proteins that promote stress granule formation in response to cellular stresses, including viral infection. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) inhibits stress granule assembly and interacts with G3BP1/2 via an ITFG motif, including residue F17, in the N protein. Prior studies examining the impact of the G3PB1-N interaction on SARS-CoV-2 replication have produced inconsistent findings, and the role of this interaction in pathogenesis is unknown. Here, we use structural and biochemical analyses to define the residues required for G3BP1-N interaction and structure-guided mutagenesis to selectively disrupt this interaction. We find that N-F17A mutation causes highly specific loss of interaction with G3BP1/2. SARS-CoV-2 N-F17A fails to inhibit stress granule assembly in cells, has decreased viral replication, and causes decreased pathology in vivo. Further mechanistic studies indicate that the N-F17-mediated G3BP1-N interaction promotes infection by limiting sequestration of viral genomic RNA (gRNA) into stress granules.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) involves a significant accumulation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as part of the host response to tumor cells. The origins and functions of transcriptionally diverse CAF populations in PDAC remain poorly understood. Tumor cell-intrinsic genetic mutations and epigenetic dysregulation may reshape the TME; however, their impacts on CAF heterogeneity remain elusive. SETD2, a histone H3K36 trimethyl-transferase, functions as a tumor suppressor. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify a lipid-laden CAF subpopulation marked by ABCA8a in Setd2-deficient pancreatic tumors. Our findings reveal that tumor-intrinsic SETD2 loss unleashes BMP2 signaling via ectopic gain of H3K27Ac, leading to CAFs differentiation toward lipid-rich phenotype. Lipid-laden CAFs then enhance tumor progression by providing lipids for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation via ABCA8a transporter. Together, our study links CAF heterogeneity to epigenetic dysregulation in tumor cells, highlighting a previously unappreciated metabolic interaction between CAFs and pancreatic tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancers bind transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and non-coding transcripts to modulate the expression of target genes. Here, we report 3D genome structures of single mouse ES cells as they are induced to exit pluripotency and transition through a formative stage prior to undergoing neuroectodermal differentiation. We find that there is a remarkable reorganization of 3D genome structure where inter-chromosomal intermingling increases dramatically in the formative state. This intermingling is associated with the formation of a large number of multiway hubs that bring together enhancers and promoters with similar chromatin states from typically 5–8 distant chromosomal sites that are often separated by many Mb from each other. In the formative state, genes important for pluripotency exit establish contacts with emerging enhancers within these multiway hubs, suggesting that the structural changes we have observed may play an important role in modulating transcription and establishing new cell identities.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have emerged as promising eco-friendly alternatives to petroleum-based plastics since they are synthesized from renewable resources and offer exceptional properties. However, their production is limited to the stationary growth phase under nutrient-limited conditions, requiring customized strategies and costly two-phase bioprocesses. In this study, we tackle these challenges by employing a model-driven approach to reroute carbon flux and remove regulatory constraints using synthetic biology. We construct a collection of Pseudomonas putida-overproducing strains at the expense of plastics and lignin-related compounds using growth-coupling approaches. PHA production was successfully achieved during growth phase, resulting in the production of up to 46% PHA/cell dry weight while maintaining a balanced carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Our strains are additionally validated under an upcycling scenario using enzymatically hydrolyzed polyethylene terephthalate as a feedstock. These findings have the potential to revolutionize PHA production and address the global plastic crisis by overcoming the complexities of traditional PHA production bioprocesses.

Abstract: Summary
Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) orchestrate T cell development by imposing positive and negative selection on thymocytes. Current studies on TEC biology are hampered by the absence of long-term ex vivo culture platforms, while the cells driving TEC self-renewal remain to be identified. Here, we generate long-term (>2 years) expandable 3D TEC organoids from the adult mouse thymus. For further analysis, we generated single and double FoxN1-P2A-Clover, Aire-P2A-tdTomato, and Cldn4-P2A-tdTomato reporter lines by CRISPR knockin. Single-cell analyses of expanding clonal organoids reveal cells with bipotent stem/progenitor phenotypes. These clonal organoids can be induced to express Foxn1 and to generate functional cortical- and Aire-expressing medullary-like TECs upon RANK ligand + retinoic acid treatment. TEC organoids support T cell development from immature thymocytes in vitro as well as in vivo upon transplantation into athymic nude mice. This organoid-based platform allows in vitro study of TEC biology and offers a potential strategy for ex vivo T cell development.

Abstract: Summary
A large-scale multimodal atlas that includes major kidney regions is lacking. Here, we employed simultaneous high-throughput single-cell ATAC/RNA sequencing (SHARE-seq) and spatially resolved metabolomics to profile 54 human samples from distinct kidney anatomical regions. We generated transcriptomes of 446,267 cells and chromatin accessibility profiles of 401,875 cells and developed a package to analyze 408,218 spatially resolved metabolomes. We find that the same cell type, including thin limb, thick ascending limb loop of Henle and principal cells, display distinct transcriptomic, chromatin accessibility, and metabolomic signatures, depending on anatomic location. Surveying metabolism-associated gene profiles revealed non-overlapping metabolic signatures between nephron segments and dysregulated lipid metabolism in diseased proximal tubule (PT) cells. Integrating multimodal omics with clinical data identified PLEKHA1 as a disease marker, and its in vitro knockdown increased gene expression in PT differentiation, suggesting possible pathogenic roles. This study highlights previously underrepresented cellular heterogeneity underlying the human kidney anatomy.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves the generation of a chromatin state that stably represses transcription. Using multiple reporter assays, a diverse set of upstream activating sequence enhancers and core promoters were investigated for their susceptibility to silencing. We show that heterochromatin stably silences only weak and stress-induced regulatory elements but is unable to stably repress housekeeping gene regulatory elements, and the partial repression of these elements did not result in bistable expression states. Permutation analysis of enhancers and promoters indicates that both elements are targets of repression. Chromatin remodelers help specific regulatory elements to resist repression, most probably by altering nucleosome mobility and changing transcription burst duration. The strong enhancers/promoters can be repressed if silencer-bound Sir1 is increased. Together, our data suggest that the heterochromatic locus has been optimized to stably silence the weak mating-type gene regulatory elements but not strong housekeeping gene regulatory sequences.

Abstract: Summary
Inert naive CD4+ T (TN) cells differentiate into functional T helper (Th) or regulatory T (Treg) cell subsets upon encountering antigens, mediating properly directed immune responses. Although all TN cells can differentiate into any of the Th and Treg cell subsets, heterogeneity exists among TN cells. By constructing reporter mice to detect ongoing T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, we identify that interleukin (IL)-1β signaling affects TN cell characteristics, independent of tonic TCR signaling, which also alters TN cell phenotypes. IL-1β reversibly attenuates the differentiation potential of TN cells toward Treg cells. IL-1β signaling is elevated in the splenic TN cells, consequently attenuating their differentiation potential toward Treg cells. Aberrant elevation of IL-1β signaling augments colitogenic activities of TN cells. TN cells in patients with colitis exhibited elevated IL-1β signaling. We demonstrate that phenotypic alteration in TN cells by IL-1β is an important mechanism in the regulation of immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Distinct dendritic cell (DC) subsets play important roles in shaping immune responses. Circulating DC precursors (pre-DCs) are more susceptible to HIV infection in vitro, which may explain the inefficiency of immune responses against HIV. However, the interplay between HIV and pre-DC is not defined in vivo. We identify human pre-DC equivalents in the cynomolgus macaque and then analyze their dynamics during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection to illustrate a sharp decrease of blood pre-DCs in early SIV infection and accumulation in lymph nodes (LNs), where they neglect to upregulate CD83/CD86 or MHC-II. Additionally, SIV infection attenuates the capacity of stimulated LN pre-DCs to produce IL-12p40. Analysis of HIV cohorts provides correlation between costimulatory molecule expression on pre-DCs and T cell activation in spontaneous HIV controllers. These findings pinpoint certain dynamics and functional changes of pre-DCs during SIV infection, providing a deeper understanding of immune dysregulation mechanisms elicited in people living with HIV.

Abstract: Summary
Drugs of abuse can persistently change the reward circuit in ways that contribute to relapse behavior, partly via mechanisms that regulate chromatin structure and function. Nuclear orphan receptor subfamily4 groupA member2 (NR4A2, also known as NURR1) is an important effector of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-dependent mechanisms in persistent memory processes and is highly expressed in the medial habenula (MHb), a region that regulates nicotine-associated behaviors. Here, expressing the Nr4a2 dominant negative (Nurr2c) in the MHb blocks reinstatement of cocaine seeking in mice. We use single-nucleus transcriptomics to characterize the molecular cascade following Nr4a2 manipulation, revealing changes in transcriptional networks related to addiction, neuroplasticity, and GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling. The network controlled by NR4A2 is characterized using a transcription factor regulatory network inference algorithm. These results identify the MHb as a pivotal regulator of relapse behavior and demonstrate the importance of NR4A2 as a key mechanism driving the MHb component of relapse.

Abstract: Summary
The KCNT1 gene encodes the sodium-activated potassium channel Slack (KCNT1, KNa1.1), a regulator of neuronal excitability. Gain-of-function mutations in humans cause cortical network hyperexcitability, seizures, and severe intellectual disability. Using a mouse model expressing the Slack-R455H mutation, we find that Na+-dependent K+ (KNa) and voltage-dependent sodium (NaV) currents are increased in both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. These increased currents, however, enhance the firing of excitability neurons but suppress that of inhibitory neurons. We further show that the expression of NaV channel subunits, particularly that of NaV1.6, is upregulated and that the length of the axon initial segment and of axonal NaV immunostaining is increased in both neuron types. Our study on the coordinate regulation of KNa currents and the expression of NaV channels may provide an avenue for understanding and treating epilepsies and other neurological disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Non-canonical lipolysis induced by inflammatory cytokines or Toll-like receptor ligands is required for the regulation of inflammation during endotoxemia and sepsis. Canonical lipolysis induced by catecholamines declines during aging due to factors including an expansion of lymphocytes, pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization, and an increase in chronic low-grade inflammation; however, the extent to which the non-canonical pathway of lipolysis is active and impacted by immune cells during aging remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to define the extent to which immune cells from old mice influence non-canonical lipolysis during sepsis. We identified age-associated impairments of non-canonical lipolysis and an accumulation of dysfunctional B1 B cells in the visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) of old mice. Lifelong deficiency of B cells results in restored non-canonical lipolysis and reductions in pro-inflammatory macrophage populations. Our study suggests that targeting the B cell-macrophage signaling axis may resolve metabolic dysfunction in aged vWAT and attenuate septic severity in older individuals.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons must be made in the correct proportions to communicate with the appropriate synaptic partners and form functional circuits. In the Drosophila visual system, multiple subtypes of distal medulla (Dm) inhibitory interneurons are made in distinct, reproducible numbers—from 5 to 800 per optic lobe. These neurons are born from a crescent-shaped neuroepithelium called the outer proliferation center (OPC), which can be subdivided into specific domains based on transcription factor and growth factor expression. We fate mapped Dm neurons and found that more abundant neural types are born from larger neuroepithelial subdomains, while less abundant subtypes are born from smaller ones. Additionally, morphogenetic Dpp/BMP signaling provides a second layer of patterning that subdivides the neuroepithelium into smaller domains to provide more granular control of cell proportions. Apoptosis appears to play a minor role in regulating Dm neuron abundance. This work describes an underappreciated mechanism for the regulation of neuronal stoichiometry.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of cells to perceive and respond to mechanical cues is essential for numerous biological activities. Emerging evidence indicates important contributions of organelles to cellular mechanosensitivity and mechanotransduction. However, whether and how the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) senses and reacts to mechanical forces remains elusive. To fill the knowledge gap, after developing a light-inducible ER-specific mechanostimulator (LIMER), we identify that mechanostimulation of ER elicits a transient, rapid efflux of Ca2+ from ER in monkey kidney COS-7 cells, which is dependent on the cation channels transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) and polycystin-2 (PKD2) in an additive manner. This ER Ca2+ release can be repeatedly stimulated and tuned by varying the intensity and duration of force application. Moreover, ER-specific mechanostimulation inhibits ER-to-Golgi trafficking. Sustained mechanostimuli increase the levels of binding-immunoglobulin protein (BiP) expression and phosphorylated eIF2α, two markers for ER stress. Our results provide direct evidence for ER mechanosensitivity and tight mechanoregulation of ER functions, placing ER as an important player on the intricate map of cellular mechanotransduction.

Abstract: Purpose
Intermittent fasting (IF) has been shown to induce a well-organized adaptive defense against stress inside the cells, which increases the production of anti-oxidant defenses, repair of DNA, biogenesis of mitochondria, and genes that combat inflammation. So, the goal of the current investigation was to identify the effects of IF on rats with adriamycin (ADR)-induced nephropathy and any potential underlying mechanisms.
Methods
Four groups of 40 mature Sprague-Dawley male rats were allocated as follow; control, fasting, ADR, and ADR plus fasting. After 8 weeks of ADR administration urine, blood samples and kidneys were taken for assessment of serum creatinine (Cr), BUN, urinary proteins, indicators of oxidative damage (malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and Catalase (CAT) levels), histopathological examinations, immunohistochemical examinations for caspase-3, Sirt1, aquaporin2 (AQP2) and real time PCR for antioxidant genes; Nrf2, HO-1 in kidney tissues.
Results
IF significantly improved serum creatinine, BUN and urinary protein excretion, oxidative stress (low MDA with high CAT and GSH), in addition to morphological damage to the renal tubules and glomeruli as well as caspase-3 production during apoptosis. Moreover, IF stimulates significantly the expression of Sirt1 and Nrf2/HO-1 and AQP2.
Conclusion
AQP2, Sirt1, Nrf2/HO-1 signaling may be upregulated and activated by IF, which alleviates ADR nephropathy. Enhancing endogenous antioxidants, reducing apoptosis and tubulointerstitial damage, and maintaining the glomerular membrane's integrity are other goals.

Abstract: Calcium signaling is a critical process required for cellular mechanisms such as cardiomyocyte contraction. The inability of the cell to properly activate or regulate calcium signaling can lead to contractile dysfunction. In isolated cardiomyocytes, calcium signaling has been primarily studied using calcium fluorescent dyes, however these dyes have limited applicability to whole organs. Here, we crossed the Salsa6f mouse which expresses a genetically encoded ratiometric cytosolic calcium indicator with a cardiomyocyte specific inducible cre to temporally-induce expression and studied cytosolic calcium transients in isolated cardiomyocytes and modified Langendorff heart preparations. Isolated cardiomyocytes expressing Salsa6f or Fluo-4AM loaded were compared. We also crossed the Salsa6f mouse with a floxed Polycystin 2 (PC2) mouse to test the feasibility of using the Salsa6f mouse to measure calcium transients in PC2 heterozygous or homozygous knock out mice. Although there are caveats in the applicability of the Salsa6f mouse, there are clear advantages to using the Salsa6f mouse to measure whole heart calcium signals.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription and splicing of pre-messenger RNA are closely coordinated, but how this functional coupling is disrupted in human diseases remains unexplored. Using isogenic cell lines, patient samples, and a mutant mouse model, we investigated how cancer-associated mutations in SF3B1 alter transcription. We found that these mutations reduce the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) along gene bodies and its density at promoters. The elongation defect results from disrupted pre-spliceosome assembly due to impaired protein-protein interactions of mutant SF3B1. The decreased promoter-proximal RNAPII density reduces both chromatin accessibility and H3K4me3 marks at promoters. Through an unbiased screen, we identified epigenetic factors in the Sin3/HDAC/H3K4me pathway, which, when modulated, reverse both transcription and chromatin changes. Our findings reveal how splicing factor mutant states behave functionally as epigenetic disorders through impaired transcription-related changes to the chromatin landscape. We also present a rationale for targeting the Sin3/HDAC complex as a therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Although the small GTPase RAB37 acts as an organizer of autophagosome biogenesis, the upstream regulatory mechanism of autophagy via guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange in maintaining retinal function has not been determined. We found that retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates RAB37 by accelerating GDP-to-GTP exchange. RPGR directly interacts with RAB37 via the RPGR-RCC1-like domain to promote autophagy through stimulating exchange. Rpgr knockout (KO) in mice leads to photoreceptor degeneration owing to autophagy impairment in the retina. Notably, the retinopathy phenotypes of Rpgr KO retinas are rescued by the adeno-associated virus-mediated transfer of pre-trans-splicing molecules, which produce normal Rpgr mRNAs via trans-splicing in the Rpgr KO retinas. This rescue upregulates autophagy through the re-expression of RPGR in KO retinas to accelerate GDP-to-GTP exchange; thus, retinal homeostasis reverts to normal. Taken together, these findings provide an important missing link for coordinating RAB37 GDP-GTP exchange via the RPGR and retinal homeostasis by autophagy regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The solid tumor microenvironment (TME) imprints a compromised metabolic state in tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs), hallmarked by the inability to maintain effective energy synthesis for antitumor function and survival. T cells in the TME must catabolize lipids via mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to supply energy in nutrient stress, and it is established that T cells enriched in FAO are adept at cancer control. However, endogenous TILs and unmodified cellular therapy products fail to sustain bioenergetics in tumors. We reveal that the solid TME imposes perpetual acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (ACC) activity, invoking lipid biogenesis and storage in TILs that opposes FAO. Using metabolic, lipidomic, and confocal imaging strategies, we find that restricting ACC rewires T cell metabolism, enabling energy maintenance in TME stress. Limiting ACC activity potentiates a gene and phenotypic program indicative of T cell longevity, engendering T cells with increased survival and polyfunctionality, which sustains cancer control.

Abstract: Summary
Condensin shapes mitotic chromosomes by folding chromatin into loops, but whether it does so by DNA-loop extrusion remains speculative. Although loop-extruding cohesin is stalled by transcription, the impact of transcription on condensin, which is enriched at highly expressed genes in many species, remains unclear. Using degrons of Rpb1 or the torpedo nuclease Dhp1XRN2 to either deplete or displace RNAPII on chromatin in fission yeast metaphase cells, we show that RNAPII does not load condensin on DNA. Instead, RNAPII retains condensin in cis and hinders its ability to fold mitotic chromatin and to support chromosome segregation, consistent with the stalling of a loop extruder. Transcription termination by Dhp1 limits such a hindrance. Our results shed light on the integrated functioning of condensin, and we argue that a tight control of transcription underlies mitotic chromosome assembly by loop-extruding condensin.

Abstract: Summary
U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is an abundant and evolutionarily conserved 164-nucleotide RNA species that functions in pre-mRNA splicing, and it is considered to be a housekeeping non-coding RNA. However, the role of U1 snRNA in regulating host antiviral immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we find that RNVU1-18, a U1 pseudogene, is significantly upregulated in the host infected with RNA viruses, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Overexpression of U1 snRNA protects cells against RNA viruses, while knockdown of U1 snRNA leads to more viral burden in vitro and in vivo. Knockout of RNVU1-18 is sufficient to impair the type I interferon-dependent antiviral innate immunity. U1 snRNA is required to fully activate the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-dependent antiviral signaling, since it interacts with tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25) and enhances the RIG-I-TRIM25 interaction to trigger K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I. Our study reveals the important role of housekeeping U1 snRNA in regulating host antiviral innate immunity and restricting RNA virus infection.

Abstract: Summary
Prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) are endogenous arachidonic acid metabolites, modulating diverse physiological processes including inflammation and cardiovascular homeostasis through activating PGF2α receptor (FP) and TXA2 receptor (TP). Ligands targeting FP and TP have demonstrated efficacy in treating conditions like glaucoma and cardiovascular diseases in humans, as well as reproductive-related diseases in animals. Here, we present five cryoelectron microscopy structures illustrating FP and TP in complex with Gq and bound to PGF2α (endogenous ligand), latanoprost acid (a clinical drug), and two other synthetic agonists. Combined with mutational and functional studies, these structures reveal not only structural features for the specific recognition of endogenous ligands and attainment of receptor selectivity of FP and TP but also the common mechanisms of receptor activation and Gq protein coupling. The findings may enrich our knowledge of ligand recognition and signal transduction of the prostanoid receptor family and facilitate rational ligand design toward these two receptors.

Abstract: Summary
The seventh iteration of the reference genome assembly for Rattus norvegicus—mRatBN7.2—corrects numerous misplaced segments and reduces base-level errors by approximately 9-fold and increases contiguity by 290-fold compared with its predecessor. Gene annotations are now more complete, improving the mapping precision of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomics datasets. We jointly analyzed 163 short-read whole-genome sequencing datasets representing 120 laboratory rat strains and substrains using mRatBN7.2. We defined ∼20.0 million sequence variations, of which 18,700 are predicted to potentially impact the function of 6,677 genes. We also generated a new rat genetic map from 1,893 heterogeneous stock rats and annotated transcription start sites and alternative polyadenylation sites. The mRatBN7.2 assembly, along with the extensive analysis of genomic variations among rat strains, enhances our understanding of the rat genome, providing researchers with an expanded resource for studies involving rats.

Abstract: The islets of Langerhans are clusters of endocrine cells surrounded by exocrine acinar cells in the pancreas. Prosaposin is a housekeeping protein required for normal lysosomal function, but its expression level is significantly different among tissues. Prosaposin also exists in various body fluids including serum. Intracellularly, prosaposin activates lysosomes and may support autophagy, and extracellularly, prosaposin promotes survival of neurons via G protein-coupled receptors. In this study, prosaposin and its mRNA expression were examined in endocrine cells of the islets as well as in exocrine acinar cells in the pancreas of mice by in situ hybridization and immunostaining. High expression levels of prosaposin were found in Alpha, Beta and Delta cells in the islets, whereas prosaposin mRNA expression was faint or negative and prosaposin immunoreactivity was negative in exocrine acinar cells. The high expression levels of prosaposin in endocrine cells may indicate that prosaposin plays a crucial role in crinophagy, which is a characteristic autophagy in peptide-secreting endocrine cells, and/or that prosaposin is secreted from pancreatic islets. Since prosaposin has been reported in serum, this study suggests a new possible function of the Langerhans islets.

Abstract: Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) is a transcription factor required for the development and differentiation of the pancreas. Previous studies indicated that PDX1 expression was restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. Using a cre-dependent reporter, we observed PDX1-dependent expression of tdtomato (PDX1-tom) in a subpopulation of sensory nerves. Many of these PDX1-tom afferents expressed the neurofilament 200 protein and projected to the skin. Tdtomato-labeled terminals were associated with hair follicles in the form of longitudinal and circumferential lanceolate endings suggesting a role in tactile and proprioceptive perception. To begin to examine the functional significance of PDX1 in afferents, we used Fura-2 imaging to examine calcium (Ca2+) handling under naïve and nerve injury conditions. Neuropathic injury is associated with increased intracellular Ca2+ signaling that in part results from dysregulation of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium transport ATPase (SERCA). Here we demonstrate that under naïve conditions, PDX1 regulates expression of the SERCA2B isoform in sensory neurons. In response to infraorbital nerve injury, a significant reduction of PDX1 and SERCA2B expression and dysregulation of Ca2+ handling occurs in PDX1-tom trigeminal ganglia neurons. The identification of PDX1 expression in the somatosensory system and its regulation of SERCA2B and Ca2+ handling provide a new mechanism to explain pathological changes in primary afferents that may contribute to pain associated with nerve injury.

Abstract: Summary
We identified and validated a collection of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that depletion of the pro-viral circRNA circATP8B(2), but not its linear siblings, compromises viral infection both in cultured Drosophila cells and in vivo. In addition, circATP8B(2) is enriched in the fly gut, and gut-specific depletion of circATP8B(2) attenuates viral replication in an oral infection model. Furthermore, circATP8B(2) depletion results in increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced expression of dual oxidase (Duox), which produces ROS. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations of circATP8B(2)-depleted flies that reduce ROS levels rescue the viral replication defects elicited by circATP8B(2) depletion. Mechanistically, circATP8B(2) associates with Duox, and circATP8B(2)-Duox interaction is crucial for circATP8B(2)-mediated modulation of Duox activity. In addition, Gαq, a G protein subunit required for optimal Duox activity, acts downstream of circATP8B(2). We conclude that circATP8B(2) regulates antiviral defense by modulating Duox expression and Duox-dependent ROS production.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the complex relationships between mRNA and protein expression at high spatiotemporal resolution is critical for unraveling multilevel gene regulation and enhancing mRNA-based developmental analyses. In this study, we conduct a single-cell analysis of mRNA and protein expression of transcription factors throughout C. elegans embryogenesis. Initially, cellular co-presence of mRNA and protein is low, increasing to a medium-high level (73%) upon factoring in delayed protein synthesis and long-term protein persistence. These factors substantially affect mRNA-protein concordance, leading to potential inaccuracies in mRNA-reliant gene detection and specificity characterization. Building on the learned relationship, we infer protein presence from mRNA expression and demonstrate its utility in identifying tissue-specific genes and elucidating relationships between genes and cells. This approach facilitates identifying the role of sptf-1/SP7 in neuronal lineage development. Collectively, this study provides insights into gene expression dynamics during rapid embryogenesis and approaches for improving the efficacy of transcriptome-based developmental analyses.

Abstract: Summary
We examined the distribution of pre-synaptic contacts in axons of mouse neurons and constructed whole-brain single-cell neuronal networks using an extensive dataset of 1,891 fully reconstructed neurons. We found that bouton locations were not homogeneous throughout the axon and among brain regions. As our algorithm was able to generate whole-brain single-cell connectivity matrices from full morphology reconstruction datasets, we further found that non-homogeneous bouton locations have a significant impact on network wiring, including degree distribution, triad census, and community structure. By perturbing neuronal morphology, we further explored the link between anatomical details and network topology. In our in silico exploration, we found that dendritic and axonal tree span would have the greatest impact on network wiring, followed by synaptic contact deletion. Our results suggest that neuroanatomical details must be carefully addressed in studies of whole-brain networks at the single-cell level.

Abstract: Summary
The cortico-basal ganglia circuit mediates decision making. Here, we generated transgenic tools for adult zebrafish targeting specific subpopulations of the components of this circuit and utilized them to identify evolutionary homologs of the mammalian direct- and indirect-pathway striatal neurons, which respectively project to the homologs of the internal and external segment of the globus pallidus (dorsal entopeduncular nucleus [dEN] and lateral nucleus of the ventral telencephalic area [Vl]) as in mammals. Unlike in mammals, the Vl mainly projects to the dEN directly, not by way of the subthalamic nucleus. Further single-cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals two pallidal output pathways: a major shortcut pathway directly connecting the dEN with the pallium and the evolutionarily conserved closed loop by way of the thalamus.

Abstract: Summary
The Bloom syndrome (BLM) helicase is critical for alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a homology-directed repair (HDR)-mediated telomere maintenance mechanism that is prevalent in cancers of mesenchymal origin. The DNA substrates that BLM engages to direct telomere recombination during ALT remain unknown. Here, we determine that BLM helicase acts on lagging strand telomere intermediates that occur specifically in ALT-positive cells to assemble a replication-associated DNA damage response. Loss of ATRX was permissive for BLM localization to ALT telomeres in S and G2, commensurate with the appearance of telomere C-strand-specific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA2 nuclease deficiency increased 5′-flap formation in a BLM-dependent manner, while telomere C-strand, but not G-strand, nicks promoted ALT. These findings define the seminal events in the ALT DNA damage response, linking aberrant telomeric lagging strand DNA replication with a BLM-directed HDR mechanism that sustains telomere length in a subset of human cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging as the most potent and durable combinational immunotherapy, dual anti-PD-1 and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy notoriously increases grade 3–5 immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients. Accordingly, attempts to improve the antitumor potency of anti-PD-1+CTLA-4 ICB by including additional therapeutics have been largely discouraged due to concerns of further increasing fatal toxicity. Here, we screened ∼3,000 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and identified clofazimine as a potential third agent to optimize anti-PD-1+CTLA-4 ICB. Remarkably, clofazimine outperforms ICB dose reduction or steroid treatment in reversing lethality of irAEs, but unlike the detrimental effect of steroids on antitumor efficacy, clofazimine potentiates curative responses in anti-PD-1+CTLA-4 ICB. Mechanistically, clofazimine promotes E2F1 activation in CD8+ T cells to overcome resistance and counteracts pathogenic Th17 cells to abolish irAEs. Collectively, clofazimine potentiates the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD-1+CTLA-4 ICB, curbs intractable irAEs, and may fill a desperate clinical need to improve patient survival.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic modification shapes differentiation trajectory and regulates the exhaustion state of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells. Limited efficacy induced by terminal exhaustion closely ties with intrinsic transcriptional regulation. However, the comprehensive regulatory mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we identify class I histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) as boosters of CAR-T cell function by high-throughput screening of chromatin-modifying drugs, in which M344 and chidamide enhance memory maintenance and resistance to exhaustion of CAR-T cells that induce sustained antitumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HDACi decrease HDAC1 expression and enhance H3K27ac activity. Multi-omics analyses from RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K27ac CUT&Tag-seq show that HDACi upregulate expression of TCF4, LEF1, and CTNNB1, which subsequently activate the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Collectively, our findings elucidate the functional roles of class I HDACi in enhancing CAR-T cell function, which provides the basis and therapeutic targets for synergic combination of CAR-T cell therapy and HDACi treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Inside the finger-like intestinal projections called villi, strands of smooth muscle cells contract to propel absorbed dietary fats through the adjacent lymphatic capillary, the lacteal, sending fats into the systemic blood circulation for energy production. Despite this vital function, mechanisms of formation, assembly alongside lacteals, and maintenance of villus smooth muscle are unknown. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitative lineage tracing of the mouse intestine, we identified a local hierarchy of subepithelial fibroblast progenitors that differentiate into mature smooth muscle fibers via intermediate contractile myofibroblasts. This continuum persists as the major mechanism for villus musculature renewal throughout adult life. The NOTCH3-DLL4 signaling axis governs the assembly of smooth muscle fibers alongside their adjacent lacteals and is required for fat absorption. Our studies identify the ontogeny and maintenance of a poorly defined class of intestinal smooth muscle, with implications for accelerated repair and recovery of digestive function following injury.

Abstract: The stromal interaction molecules (STIMs) are the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ sensors that trigger store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in a variety of cell types. While STIM1 isoform has been the focus of the research in cardiac pathophysiology, the function of the homolog STIM2 remains unknown. Using Ca2+ imaging and patch-clamp techniques, we showed that knockdown (KD) of STIM2 by siRNAs increased SOCE and the ISOC current in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs). Within this cardiomyocyte model, we identified the transcript expression of Stim2.1 and Stim2.2 splice variants, with predominance for Stim2.2. Using conventional and super-resolution confocal microscopy (STED), we found that exogenous STIM2.1 and STIM2.2 formed pre-clusters with a reticular organization at rest. Following SR Ca2+ store depletion, some STIM2.1 and STIM2.2 clusters were translocated to SR-plasma membrane (PM) junctions and co-localized with Orai1. The overexpression strategy revealed that STIM2.1 suppressed Orai1-mediated SOCE and the ISOC current while STIM2.2 enhanced SOCE. STIM2.2-enhanced SOCE was also dependent on TRPC1 and TRPC4. Even if STIM2 KD or splice variants overexpression did not affect cytosolic Ca2+ cycling, we observed, using Rhod-2/AM Ca2+ imaging, that Orai1 inhibition or STIM2.1 overexpression abolished the mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa2+) uptake, as opposed to STIM2 KD. We also found that STIM2 was present in the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAMs) by interacting with the inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), and mitofusin-2 (MNF2). Our results suggested that, in NRVMs, STIM2.1 constitutes the predominant functional variant that negatively regulates Orai1-generated SOCE. It participates in the control of mCa2+ uptake capacity possibly via the STIM2-IP3Rs-VDAC-MCU and MNF2 complex.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are important innate immune cells with plasticity, heterogenicity, and functional ambivalency. While bone marrow is often regarded as the primary source of neutrophil production, the roles of extramedullary production in regulating neutrophil plasticity and heterogenicity in autoimmune diseases remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the lack of wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 5 (WNT5) unleashes anti-inflammatory protection against colitis in mice, accompanied by reduced colonic CD8+ T cell activation and enhanced splenic extramedullary myelopoiesis. In addition, colitis upregulates WNT5 expression in splenic stromal cells. The ablation of WNT5 leads to increased splenic production of hematopoietic niche factors, as well as elevated numbers of splenic neutrophils with heightened CD8+ T cell suppressive capability, in part due to elevated CD101 expression and attenuated pro-inflammatory activities. Thus, our study reveals a mechanism by which neutrophil plasticity and heterogenicity are regulated in colitis through WNT5 and highlights the role of splenic neutrophil production in shaping inflammatory outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Steady-state expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) explain only a fraction of disease-associated loci identified through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), while eQTLs involved in gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions have rarely been characterized in humans due to experimental challenges. Using a baboon model, we found hundreds of eQTLs that emerge in adipose, liver, and muscle after prolonged exposure to high dietary fat and cholesterol. Diet-responsive eQTLs exhibit genomic localization and genic features that are distinct from steady-state eQTLs. Furthermore, the human orthologs associated with diet-responsive eQTLs are enriched for GWAS genes associated with human metabolic traits, suggesting that context-responsive eQTLs with more complex regulatory effects are likely to explain GWAS hits that do not seem to overlap with standard eQTLs. Our results highlight the complexity of genetic regulatory effects and the potential of eQTLs with disease-relevant GxE interactions in enhancing the understanding of GWAS signals for human complex disease using non-human primate models.

Abstract: Summary
The brain can generate actions, such as reaching to a target, using different movement strategies. We investigate how such strategies are learned in a task where perched head-fixed mice learn to reach to an invisible target area from a set start position using a joystick. This can be achieved by learning to move in a specific direction or to a specific endpoint location. As mice learn to reach the target, they refine their variable joystick trajectories into controlled reaches, which depend on the sensorimotor cortex. We show that individual mice learned strategies biased to either direction- or endpoint-based movements. This endpoint/direction bias correlates with spatial directional variability with which the workspace was explored during training. Model-free reinforcement learning agents can generate both strategies with similar correlation between variability during training and learning bias. These results provide evidence that reinforcement of individual exploratory behavior during training biases the reaching strategies that mice learn.

Abstract: Summary
Gene regulatory divergence between species can result from cis-acting local changes to regulatory element DNA sequences or global trans-acting changes to the regulatory environment. Understanding how these mechanisms drive regulatory evolution has been limited by challenges in identifying trans-acting changes. We present a comprehensive approach to directly identify cis- and trans-divergent regulatory elements between human and rhesus macaque lymphoblastoid cells using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin coupled to self-transcribing active regulatory region (ATAC-STARR) sequencing. In addition to thousands of cis changes, we discover an unexpected number (∼10,000) of trans changes and show that cis and trans elements exhibit distinct patterns of sequence divergence and function. We further identify differentially expressed transcription factors that underlie ∼37% of trans differences and trace how cis changes can produce cascades of trans changes. Overall, we find that most divergent elements (67%) experienced changes in both cis and trans, revealing a substantial role for trans divergence—alone and together with cis changes—in regulatory differences between species.

Abstract: Summary
The Drosophila lymph gland houses blood progenitors that give rise to myeloid-like blood cells. Initially, blood progenitors proliferate, but later, they become quiescent to maintain multipotency before differentiation. Despite the identification of various factors involved in multipotency maintenance, the cellular mechanism controlling blood progenitor quiescence remains elusive. Here, we identify the expression of nitric oxide synthase in blood progenitors, generating nitric oxide for post-translational S-nitrosylation of protein cysteine residues. S-nitrosylation activates the Ire1-Xbp1-mediated unfolded protein response, leading to G2 cell-cycle arrest. Specifically, we identify the epidermal growth factor receptor as a target of S-nitrosylation, resulting in its retention within the endoplasmic reticulum and blockade of its receptor function. Overall, our findings highlight developmentally programmed S-nitrosylation as a critical mechanism that induces protein quality control in blood progenitors, maintaining their undifferentiated state by inhibiting cell-cycle progression and rendering them unresponsive to paracrine factors.

Abstract: Objective
With the growing interest in the role of fibroblasts in osteogenesis, this study presents a comparative evaluation of the osteogenic potential of fibroblasts derived from three distinct sources: human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH3T3 cells), and mouse subcutaneous fibroblasts (L929 cells). MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells were employed as a positive control for osteogenic behavior.
Design
Our assessment involved multiple approaches, including vimentin staining for cell origin verification, as well as ALP and ARS staining in conjunction with RT-PCR for osteogenic characterization.
Results
Our findings revealed the superior osteogenic differentiation capacity of HGFs compared to MC3T3-E1 and NIH3T3 cells. Analysis of ALP staining confirmed that early osteogenic differentiation was most prominent in MC3T3-E1 cells at 7 days, followed by NIH3T3 and HGFs. However, ARS staining at 21 days demonstrated that HGFs produced the highest number of calcified nodules, indicating their robust potential for late-stage mineralization. This late-stage osteogenic potential of HGFs was further validated through RT-PCR analysis. In contrast, L929 cells displayed no significant osteogenic differentiation potential.
Conclusions
In light of these findings, HGFs emerge as the preferred choice for seed cells in bone tissue engineering applications. This study provides valuable insights into the potential utility of HGFs in the fields of bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Fear overgeneralization is a maladaptive response to traumatic stress that is associated with the inability to discriminate between threat and safety contexts, a hallmark feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the neural mechanisms underlying this deficit remain unclear. Here, we show that traumatic stress exposure impairs contextual discrimination between threat and safety contexts in the learned helplessness (LH) model. Mossy cells (MCs) in the dorsal hippocampus are suppressed in response to traumatic stress. Bidirectional manipulation of MC activity in the LH model reveals that MC inhibition is causally linked to impaired contextual discrimination. Mechanistically, MC inhibition increases the number of active granule cells in a given context, significantly overlapping context-specific ensembles. Our study demonstrates that maladaptive inhibition of MCs after traumatic stress is a substantial mechanism underlying fear overgeneralization with contextual discrimination deficit, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for cognitive symptoms of PTSD.

Abstract: Summary
The basal breast cancer subtype is enriched for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and displays consistent large chromosomal deletions. Here, we characterize evolution and maintenance of chromosome 4p (chr4p) loss in basal breast cancer. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data shows recurrent deletion of chr4p in basal breast cancer. Phylogenetic analysis of a panel of 23 primary tumor/patient-derived xenograft basal breast cancers reveals early evolution of chr4p deletion. Mechanistically we show that chr4p loss is associated with enhanced proliferation. Gene function studies identify an unknown gene, C4orf19, within chr4p, which suppresses proliferation when overexpressed—a member of the PDCD10-GCKIII kinase module we name PGCKA1. Genome-wide pooled overexpression screens using a barcoded library of human open reading frames identify chromosomal regions, including chr4p, that suppress proliferation when overexpressed in a context-dependent manner, implicating network interactions. Together, these results shed light on the early emergence of complex aneuploid karyotypes involving chr4p and adaptive landscapes shaping breast cancer genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play a key role in gene repression and are indispensable for proper development. Canonical PRC1 forms condensates in vitro and in cells that are proposed to contribute to the maintenance of repression. However, how chromatin and the various subunits of PRC1 contribute to condensation is largely unexplored. Using a reconstitution approach and single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that nucleosomal arrays and PRC1 act synergistically, reducing the critical concentration required for condensation by more than 20-fold. We find that the exact combination of PHC and CBX subunits determines condensate initiation, morphology, stability, and dynamics. Particularly, PHC2’s polymerization activity influences condensate dynamics by promoting the formation of distinct domains that adhere to each other but do not coalesce. Live-cell imaging confirms CBX’s role in condensate initiation and highlights PHC’s importance for condensate stability. We propose that PRC1 composition can modulate condensate properties, providing crucial regulatory flexibility across developmental stages.

Abstract: Summary
MCL-1 is essential for promoting the survival of many normal cell lineages and confers survival and chemoresistance in cancer. Beyond apoptosis regulation, MCL-1 has been linked to modulating mitochondrial metabolism, but the mechanism(s) by which it does so are unclear. Here, we show in tissues and cells that MCL-1 supports essential steps in long-chain (but not short-chain) fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) through its binding to specific long-chain acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthetases of the ACSL family. ACSL1 binds to the BH3-binding hydrophobic groove of MCL-1 through a non-conventional BH3-domain. Perturbation of this interaction, via genetic loss of Mcl1, mutagenesis, or use of selective BH3-mimetic MCL-1 inhibitors, represses long-chain FAO in cells and in mouse livers and hearts. Our findings reveal how anti-apoptotic MCL-1 facilitates mitochondrial metabolism and indicate that disruption of this function may be associated with unanticipated cardiac toxicities of MCL-1 inhibitors in clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
In adult mammals, injured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) fail to spontaneously regrow severed axons, resulting in permanent visual deficits. Robust axon growth, however, is observed after intra-ocular injection of particulate β-glucan isolated from yeast. Blood-borne myeloid cells rapidly respond to β-glucan, releasing numerous pro-regenerative factors. Unfortunately, the pro-regenerative effects are undermined by retinal damage inflicted by an overactive immune system. Here, we demonstrate that protection of the inflamed vasculature promotes immune-mediated RGC regeneration. In the absence of microglia, leakiness of the blood-retina barrier increases, pro-inflammatory neutrophils are elevated, and RGC regeneration is reduced. Functional ablation of the complement receptor 3 (CD11b/integrin-αM), but not the complement components C1q−/− or C3−/−, reduces ocular inflammation, protects the blood-retina barrier, and enhances RGC regeneration. Selective targeting of neutrophils with anti-Ly6G does not increase axogenic neutrophils but protects the blood-retina barrier and enhances RGC regeneration. Together, these findings reveal that protection of the inflamed vasculature promotes neuronal regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular Mg2+ (iMg2+) is bound with phosphometabolites, nucleic acids, and proteins in eukaryotes. Little is known about the intracellular compartmentalization and molecular details of Mg2+ transport into/from cellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that the ER is a major iMg2+ compartment refilled by a largely uncharacterized ER-localized protein, TMEM94. Conventional and AlphaFold2 predictions suggest that ERMA (TMEM94) is a multi-pass transmembrane protein with large cytosolic headpiece actuator, nucleotide, and phosphorylation domains, analogous to P-type ATPases. However, ERMA uniquely combines a P-type ATPase domain and a GMN motif for ERMg2+ uptake. Experiments reveal that a tyrosine residue is crucial for Mg2+ binding and activity in a mechanism conserved in both prokaryotic (mgtB and mgtA) and eukaryotic Mg2+ ATPases. Cardiac dysfunction by haploinsufficiency, abnormal Ca2+ cycling in mouse Erma+/− cardiomyocytes, and ERMA mRNA silencing in human iPSC-cardiomyocytes collectively define ERMA as an essential component of ERMg2+ uptake in eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has been implicated in many cell processes and diseases. YTHDF1, a translation-facilitating m6A reader, has not been previously shown to be related to allergic airway inflammation. Here, we report that YTHDF1 is highly expressed in allergic airway epithelial cells and asthmatic patients and that it influences proinflammatory responses. CLOCK, a subunit of the circadian clock pathway, is the direct target of YTHDF1. YTHDF1 augments CLOCK translation in an m6A-dependent manner. Allergens enhance the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of YTHDF1 and drive the formation of a complex comprising dimeric YTHDF1 and CLOCK mRNA, which is distributed to stress granules. Moreover, YTHDF1 strongly activates NLRP3 inflammasome production and interleukin-1β secretion leading to airway inflammatory responses, but these phenotypes are abolished by deleting CLOCK. These findings demonstrate that YTHDF1 is an important regulator of asthmatic airway inflammation, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for allergic airway inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity is a major hurdle in primary liver cancer (PLC) precision therapy. Here, we establish a PLC biobank, consisting of 399 tumor organoids derived from 144 patients, which recapitulates histopathology and genomic landscape of parental tumors, and is reliable for drug sensitivity screening, as evidenced by both in vivo models and patient response. Integrative analysis dissects PLC heterogeneity, regarding genomic/transcriptomic characteristics and sensitivity to seven clinically relevant drugs, as well as clinical associations. Pharmacogenomic analysis identifies and validates multi-gene expression signatures predicting drug response for better patient stratification. Furthermore, we reveal c-Jun as a major mediator of lenvatinib resistance through JNK and β-catenin signaling. A compound (PKUF-01) comprising moieties of lenvatinib and veratramine (c-Jun inhibitor) is synthesized and screened, exhibiting a marked synergistic effect. Together, our study characterizes the landscape of PLC heterogeneity, develops predictive biomarker panels, and identifies a lenvatinib-resistant mechanism for combination therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Memorizing locations that are harmful or dangerous is a key capability of all organisms and requires an integration of affective and spatial information. In mammals, the dorsal hippocampus mainly processes spatial information, while the intermediate to ventral hippocampal divisions receive affective information via the amygdala. However, how spatial and aversive information is integrated is currently unknown. To address this question, we recorded the activity of hippocampal long-range CA3 axons at single-axon resolution in mice forming an aversive spatial memory. We show that intermediate CA3 to dorsal CA3 (i-dCA3) projections rapidly overrepresent areas preceding the location of an aversive stimulus due to a spatially selective addition of new place-coding axons followed by spatially non-specific stabilization. This sequence significantly improves the encoding of location by the i-dCA3 axon population. These results suggest that i-dCA3 axons transmit a precise, denoised, and stable signal indicating imminent danger to the dorsal hippocampus.

Abstract: Summary
During oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis, changes in mRNA poly(A)-tail lengths strongly influence translation, but how these tail-length changes are orchestrated has been unclear. Here, we performed tail-length and translational profiling of mRNA reporter libraries (each with millions of 3′ UTR sequence variants) in frog oocytes and embryos and in fish embryos. Contrasting to previously proposed cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs), we found that a shorter element, UUUUA, together with the polyadenylation signal (PAS), specify cytoplasmic polyadenylation, and we identified contextual features that modulate the activity of both elements. In maturing oocytes, this tail lengthening occurs against a backdrop of global deadenylation and the action of C-rich elements that specify tail-length-independent translational repression. In embryos, cytoplasmic polyadenylation becomes more permissive, and additional elements specify waves of stage-specific deadenylation. Together, these findings largely explain the complex tapestry of tail-length changes observed in early frog and fish development, with strong evidence of conservation in both mice and humans.

Abstract: Summary
RNA transcribed from enhancers, i.e., eRNA, has been suggested to directly activate transcription by recruiting transcription factors and co-activators. Although there have been specific examples of eRNA functioning in this way, it is not clear how general this may be. We find that the AT-hook of SWI/SNF preferentially binds RNA and, as part of the esBAF complex, associates with eRNA transcribed from intronic and intergenic regions. Our data suggest that SWI/SNF is globally recruited in cis by eRNA to cell-type-specific enhancers, representative of two distinct stages that mimic early mammalian development, and not at enhancers that are shared between the two stages. In this manner, SWI/SNF facilitates recruitment and/or activation of MLL3/4, p300/CBP, and Mediator to stage-specific enhancers and super-enhancers that regulate the transcription of metabolic and cell lineage priming-related genes. These findings highlight a connection between ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and eRNA in cell identity and typical- and super-enhancer activation.

Abstract: Summary
The gut-brain axis is implicated in depression development, yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. We observed depleted gut bacterial species, including Bifidobacterium longum and Roseburia intestinalis, and the neurotransmitter homovanillic acid (HVA) in individuals with depression and mouse depression models. Although R. intestinalis does not directly produce HVA, it enhances B. longum abundance, leading to HVA generation. This highlights a synergistic interaction among gut microbiota in regulating intestinal neurotransmitter production. Administering HVA, B. longum, or R. intestinalis to mouse models with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression significantly improved depressive symptoms. Mechanistically, HVA inhibited synaptic autophagic death by preventing excessive degradation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and SQSTM1/p62 proteins, protecting hippocampal neurons’ presynaptic membrane. These findings underscore the role of the gut microbial metabolism in modulating synaptic integrity and provide insights into potential novel treatment strategies for depression.

Abstract: Summary
Eosinophils play a crucial role in host defense while also contributing to immunopathology through the release of inflammatory mediators. Characterized by distinctive cytoplasmic granules, eosinophils securely store and rapidly release various proteins exhibiting high toxicity upon extracellular release. Among these, major basic protein 1 (MBP-1) emerges as an important mediator in eosinophil function against pathogens and in eosinophil-associated diseases. While MBP-1 targets both microorganisms and host cells, its precise mechanism remains elusive. We demonstrate that formation of small pores by MBP-1 in lipid bilayers induces membrane permeabilization and disrupts potassium balance. Additionally, we reveal that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) present in eosinophil extracellular traps (EETs) amplifies MBP-1 toxic effects, underscoring the pivotal role of mtDNA in EETs. Furthermore, we present evidence indicating that absence of CpG methylation in mtDNA contributes to the regulation of MBP-1-mediated toxicity. Taken together, our data suggest that the mtDNA scaffold within extracellular traps promotes MBP-1 toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Cultivating drought-tolerant tea varieties enhances both yield and quality of tea plants in northern China. However, the mechanisms underlying their drought tolerance remain largely unknown. Here we identified a key regulator called CsREV, which differentially regulates xylem patterns between leaves and stems, thereby conferring drought tolerance in tea plants. When drought occurs, upregulation of CsREV activates the CsVND7a-dependent xylem vessel differentiation. However, when drought persists, the vessel differentiation is hindered as CsVND7a is downregulated by CsTCP4a. This, combined with the CsREV-promoted secondary-cell-wall thickness of xylem vessel, leads to the enhanced curling of leaves, a characteristic closely associated with plant drought tolerance. Notably, this inhibitory effect of CsTCP4a on CsVND7a expression is absent in stems, allowing stem xylem vessels to continuously differentiate. Overall, the CsREV-CsTCP4-CsVND7 module is differentially utilized to shape the xylem patterns in leaves and stems, potentially balancing water transportation and utilization to improve tea plant drought tolerance.

Abstract: Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic lung condition that produces symptoms including coughing which may cause by excessive accumulation of scar tissue inflammatory and oxidative stress exacerbation. Sumatriptan, utilized for migraine treatment as a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist, has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in multiple preclinical investigations. Operating primarily on serotonin receptors, sumatriptan leverages the diverse physiological functions of serotonin, playing a pivotal role in regulating both inflammation and oxidative stress which is particularly relevant in the context of IPF.
Materials & methods
Thirty-five male Wistar rats were divided to five group, including: Sham (without IPF induction), control (BLM 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and three fibrosis group with sumatriptan (0.5, 1, and 3 mg/kg, i.p. for 2 weeks) administration. IPF was induced by injection of BLM (single dose, 5 mg/kg intratracheally). Lung tissues were separated for measurement of myeloperoxidase (MPO) as an oxidative stress hallmark, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-β), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) as inflammatory markers as well as alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Also, for histological investigations, tissue damages were assessed by Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome staining method.
Results
BLM-induced fibrosis could increase α-SMA, MPO, TNF-α, IL-1β, and TGF-β, while treatment with sumatriptan has reversed the α-SMA, MPO, and IL-1β levels. Moreover, the results of H&E and Masson’s trichrome staining indicated that sumatriptan (1 and 3 mg/kg) reduced tissue damages, alveolar wall thickness, collagen accumulation, and pulmonary fibrosis induced by BLM.
Conclusion
According to the data achieved from this study, Sumatriptan appears to have therapeutic benefits in IPF, possibly via reducing α-SMA as well as inflammation and the toxicity caused by oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Cytidine deaminase defines the properties of cytosine base editors (CBEs) for C-to-T conversion. Replacing the cytidine deaminase rat APOBEC1 (rA1) in CBEs with a human APOBEC3A (hA3A) improves CBE properties. However, the potential CBE application of macaque A3A orthologs remains undetermined. Our current study develops and evaluates engineered CBEs based on Macaca fascicularis A3A (mA3A). Here, we demonstrate that BE4-mA3A and its RNA-editing-derived variants exhibit improved CBE properties, except for DNA off-target activity, compared to BE3-rA1 and BE4-rA1. Unexpectedly, deleting Ser-Val-Arg (SVR) in BE4-mA3A dramatically reduces DNA and RNA off-target activities and improves editing accuracy, with on-target efficiency unaffected. In contrast, a chimeric BE4-hA3A-SVR+ shows editing efficiency increased by about 50%, with other properties unaffected. Our findings demonstrate that mA3A-based CBEs could provide prototype options with advantages over rA1- and hA3A-based CBEs for further optimization, highlighting the importance of the SVR motif in defining CBE intrinsic properties.

Abstract: Summary
The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I)-mediated tumor antigen processing and presentation (APP) pathway is essential for the recruitment and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8+ CTLs). However, this pathway is frequently dysregulated in many cancers, thus leading to a failure of immunotherapy. Here, we report that activation of the tumor-intrinsic Hippo pathway positively correlates with the expression of MHC class I APP genes and the abundance of CD8+ CTLs in mouse tumors and patients. Blocking the Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein/transcriptional enhanced associate domain (YAP/TEAD) potently improves antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, the YAP/TEAD complex cooperates with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex to repress NLRC5 transcription. The upregulation of NLRC5 by YAP/TEAD depletion or pharmacological inhibition increases the expression of MHC class I APP genes and enhances CD8+ CTL-mediated killing of cancer cells. Collectively, our results suggest a crucial tumor-promoting function of YAP depending on NLRC5 to impair the MHC class I APP pathway and provide a rationale for inhibiting YAP activity in immunotherapy for cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Myriad physiological and pathogenic processes are governed by protein levels and modifications. Controlled protein activity perturbation is essential to studying protein function in cells and animals. Based on Trim-Away technology, we screened for truncation variants of E3 ubiquitinase Trim21 with elevated efficiency (ΔTrim21) and developed multiple ΔTrim21-based targeted protein-degradation systems (ΔTrim-TPD) that can be transfected into host cells. Three ΔTrim-TPD variants are developed to enable chemical and light-triggered programmable activation of TPD in cells and animals. Specifically, we used ΔTrim-TPD for (1) red-light-triggered inhibition of HSV-1 virus proliferation by degrading the packaging protein gD, (2) for chemical-triggered control of the activity of Cas9/dCas9 protein for gene editing, and (3) for blue-light-triggered degradation of two tumor-associated proteins for spatiotemporal inhibition of melanoma tumor growth in mice. Our study demonstrates that multiple ΔTrim21-based controllable TPD systems provide powerful tools for basic biology research and highlight their potential biomedical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are essential for the establishment of self-tolerance in T cells. Promiscuous gene expression by a subpopulation of mTECs regulated by the nuclear protein Aire contributes to the display of self-genomic products to newly generated T cells. Recent reports have highlighted additional self-antigen-displaying mTEC subpopulations, namely Fezf2-expressing mTECs and a mosaic of self-mimetic mTECs including thymic tuft cells. In addition, a functionally different subset of mTECs produces chemokine CCL21, which attracts developing thymocytes to the medullary region. Here, we report that CCL21+ mTECs and Aire+ mTECs non-redundantly cooperate to direct self-tolerance to prevent autoimmune pathology by optimizing the deletion of self-reactive T cells and the generation of regulatory T cells. We also detect cooperation for self-tolerance between Aire and Fezf2, the latter of which unexpectedly regulates thymic tuft cells. Our results indicate an indispensable interplay among functionally diverse mTECs for the establishment of central self-tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the most common causative agent of urinary tract infection (UTI). UPEC invades bladder epithelial cells (BECs) via fusiform vesicles, escapes into the cytosol, and establishes biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDK) is secreted by pathogenic bacteria to enhance virulence. However, whether NDK is involved in UPEC pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we find that the lack of ndk impairs the colonization of UPEC CFT073 in mouse bladders and kidneys owing to the impaired ability of UPEC to form IBCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NDK inhibits caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis by consuming extracellular ATP, preventing superficial BEC exfoliation, and promoting IBC formation. UPEC utilizes the reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensor OxyR to indirectly activate the regulator integration host factor, which then directly activates ndk expression in response to intracellular ROS. Here, we reveal a signaling transduction pathway that UPEC employs to inhibit superficial BEC exfoliation, thus facilitating acute UTI.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms by which genomic risks contribute to the onset of neuropsychiatric conditions remain a key challenge and a prerequisite for successful development of effective therapies. 15q11.2 copy number variation (CNV) containing the CYFIP1 gene is associated with autism and schizophrenia. Using stem cell models, we show that 15q11.2 deletion (15q11.2del) and CYFIP1 loss of function (CYFIP1-LoF) lead to premature neuronal differentiation, while CYFIP1 gain of function (CYFIP1-GoF) favors neural progenitor maintenance. CYFIP1 dosage changes led to dysregulated cholesterol metabolism and altered levels of 24S,25-epoxycholesterol, which can mimic the 15q11.2del and CYFIP1-LoF phenotypes by promoting cortical neuronal differentiation and can restore the impaired neuronal differentiation of CYFIP1-GoF neural progenitors. Moreover, the neurogenic activity of 24S,25-epoxycholesterol is lost following genetic deletion of liver X receptor (LXRβ), while compound deletion of LXRβ in CYFIP1−/− background rescued their premature neurogenesis. This work delineates LXR-mediated oxysterol regulation of neurogenesis as a pathological mechanism in neural cells carrying 15q11.2 CNV and provides a potential target for therapeutic strategies for associated disorders.
