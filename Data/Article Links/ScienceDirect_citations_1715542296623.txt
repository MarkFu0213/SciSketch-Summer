Abstract: Summary
TET2 is a methylcytosine dioxygenase that regulates cytosine hydroxymethylation. Although there are extensive data implicating a pivotal role of TET2 in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), the importance of TET2 in bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) remains unknown. In this study, we show that loss of TET2 in BMSCs increases cell proliferation and self-renewal and enhances osteoblast differentiation potential of BMSCs, which may in turn alter their behavior in supporting HSPC proliferation and differentiation. In addition, Tet2 loss alters BMSCs in promoting Tet2-deficiency-mediated myeloid malignancy progression. Tet2 loss in BMSCs also dysregulates hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and the expression of genes that are key for BMSC proliferation and osteoblast differentiation, leading to alteration of biological characteristics in vivo. These results highlight the critical role of TET2 in the maintenance of BMSC functions and osteoblast differentiation and provide evidence that dysregulation of epigenetic modifiers in BMSCs contributes to the progression of myeloid malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) internalize into susceptible bacteria using specific transporters and interfere with protein synthesis and folding. To date, mammalian PrAMPs have so far been identified only in artiodactyls. Since cetaceans are co-phyletic with artiodactyls, we mined the genome of the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, leading to the identification of two PrAMPs, Tur1A and Tur1B. Tur1A, which is orthologous to the bovine PrAMP Bac7, is internalized into Escherichia coli, without damaging the membranes, using the inner membrane transporters SbmA and YjiL/MdM. Furthermore, like Bac7, Tur1A also inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the ribosome and blocking the transition from the initiation to the elongation phase. By contrast, Tur1B is a poor inhibitor of protein synthesis and may utilize another mechanism of action. An X-ray structure of Tur1A bound within the ribosomal exit tunnel provides a basis to develop these peptides as novel antimicrobial agents.

Abstract: Summary
Pseudouridimycin (PUM) is a selective nucleoside-analog inhibitor of bacterial RNA polymerase with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. PUM, produced by Streptomyces sp. ID38640, consists of a formamidinylated, N-hydroxylated Gly-Gln dipeptide conjugated to 5′-aminopseudouridine. We report the characterization of the PUM gene cluster. Bioinformatic analysis and mutational knockouts of pum genes with analysis of accumulated intermediates, define the PUM biosynthetic pathway. The work provides the first biosynthetic pathway of a C-nucleoside antibiotic and reveals three unexpected features: production of free pseudouridine by the dedicated pseudouridine synthase, PumJ; nucleoside activation by specialized oxidoreductases and aminotransferases; and peptide-bond formation by amide ligases. A central role in the PUM biosynthetic pathway is played by the PumJ, which represents a divergent branch within the TruD family of pseudouridine synthases. PumJ-like sequences are associated with diverse gene clusters likely to govern the biosynthesis of different classes of C-nucleoside antibiotics.

Abstract: Previous reports, including our experimental results, showed that macrophages migrate to prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We tested whether the migrated macrophages affect the susceptibility of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cells to cytotoxic actions of natural killer (NK) cells. We found treatment of tumor cells with the conditioned media (CM) of the PMA/IL-4 treated THP-1 cells (M2 type macrophages) (THP-1 CM) decreased the susceptibility of tumor cells to NK cell cytotoxicity, as a result of increased programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) and decreased NK group 2D (NKG2D) ligands in CRPC cells. Meanwhile, the decreased susceptibility of tumor cells was also detected when NK cells were treated with THP-1 CM and used in NK cell cytotoxicity tests. Therefore, we observed higher resistance of CRPC cells when both tumor and NK cells were treated with THP-1 CM than when tumor cells or NK cells were individually treated. We further discovered that the PMA/IL-4 treated THP-1 cells secrete a high level of IL-6, so blocking the IL-6 action significantly decreased the PD-L1 level while recovering the NKG2D ligands, thus increasing the susceptibility of CRPC cells to NK cell action. Moreover, we discovered that JAK-Stat3 is the most critical IL-6 downstream signaling in triggering the THP-1 CM effect. Consequently, we found the susceptibility of CRPC cells to NK cells was increased when either JAK or Stat 3 inhibitor was added when tumor cells were treated with THP-1 CM, and that the best effect was observed when the JAK inhibitor and PD-L1 Ab were added together.

Abstract: Renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), and no effective treatment is available to date. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that Tisp40 exacerbates tubular cell apoptosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis after renal IR injury. However, the role of Tisp40 in renal inflammatory responses and tubular cell proliferation during renal IR injury remains unknown. In this study, Tisp40 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were induced with or without renal IR injury. For renal IR, bilateral renal pedicels were exposed and clamped to induce 30 min of ischemia. After 48 h of reperfusion, the kidneys were collected for analyses. Results showed that Tisp40 deficiency attenuates neutrophil and macrophage infiltration after renal IR. Consistently, the protein levels of TNF-α and MCP-1 were markedly decreased, and the phosphorylation levels of IκBα and P65 were inhibited in Tisp40-deficient mice than in WT mice in renal IR injury. In addition, compared with WT mice, Tisp40 deficiency significantly increased the expression levels of proliferative cellular nuclear antigen and phosphorylated Erk1/2 after renal IR injury. In conclusion, Tisp40 deficiency limits renal inflammatory responses and promotes tubular cell proliferation in ischemic AKI.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters hepatocytes via various entry factors, including scavenger receptor BI (SR-B1), cluster of differentiation 81 (CD81), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), claudin-1 (CLDN1), and occludin (OCLN). As CLDN1 and OCLN are not readily accessible due to their tight junctional localization, HCV likely accesses them by either disrupting cellular polarity or migrating to the tight junction. In this study, we image HCV entry into a three-dimensional polarized hepatoma system and reveal that the virus sequentially engages these entry factors through actin-dependent mechanisms. HCV initially localizes with the early entry factors SR-B1, CD81, and EGFR at the basolateral membrane and then accumulates at the tight junction in an actin-dependent manner. HCV associates with CLDN1 and then OCLN at the tight junction and is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis by an active process requiring EGFR. Thus, HCV uses a dynamic and multi-step process to engage and enter host cells.

Abstract: High expression of Hsp27 in glioma cells has been closely associated with tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis inhibition. The aim of the present study was to asses the effects of rosmarinic acid (RA) on Hsp27 expression and apoptosis in non-transfected and transfected human U-87 MG cells. The effect of rosmarinic acid was compared to quercetin, which is known to be a good Hsp27 inhibitor. In order to block the expression of Hsp27 gene (HSPB1), transfection with specific siRNAs was performed. Western blotting technique was used to assess the Hsp27 expression, and caspase-3 colorimetric activity assay was performed to determine apoptosis induction. According to the results, it was found that RA and quercetin effectively silenced Hsp27 and both agents induced apoptosis by activating the caspase-3 pathway. Eighty and 215μm RA decreased the level of Hsp27 by 28.8 and 46.7% and induced apoptosis by 30 and 54%, respectively. For the first time, we reported that rosmarinic acid has the ability to trigger caspase-3 induced apoptosis in human glioma cells. As a result of siRNA transfection, the Hsp27 gene was silenced by ~ 50% but did not cause a statistically significant change in caspase-3 activation. It was also observed that apoptosis was induced at a higher level as a result of Hsp27 siRNA and subsequent quercetin or RA treatment. siRNA transfection and 215μm RA treatment suppressed Hsp27 expression level by 90.5% and increased caspase-3 activity by 58%. Herein, we demonstrated that RA administered with siRNA seems to be a potent combination for glioblastoma therapy.

Abstract: Background
CDK8 is associated with the transcriptional Mediator complex and has been shown to regulate several transcription factors implicated in cancer. As a pancreatic cancer oncogene, the role of CDK8 in cancer angiogenesis remains unclear. Here, we investigated the contribution of CDK8 in pancreatic cancer angiogenesis and examined the underlying molecular mechanisms.
Methods
CDK8 expression was evaluated via immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and qRT-PCR in relation to the clinicopathological characteristics of pancreatic cancer patients. The effects of silencing or overexpressing CDK8 on cancer angiogenesis were assessed in vitro by western blotting assays in pancreatic cancer cell lines and in vivo with nude mice xenograft models.
Results
Compared with adjacent normal tissues, pancreatic cancer tissues showed upregulation of CDK8 expression, which was inversely correlated with T grade, liver metastasis, size, lymph node metastasis and poor survival. CDK8 overexpression promoted angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer via activation of the CDK8-β-catenin-KLF2 signaling axis, as demonstrated by the upregulation and downregulation of signals representing the rate-limiting steps in angiogenesis. Silencing CDK8 inhibited angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer in vitro. Additionally, these results were confirmed in nude mice xenograft models in vivo.
Conclusions
CDK8 promotes angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer via activation of the CDK8-β-catenin-KLF2 signaling axis, thus providing valid targets for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are major components of the tumor stroma and regulators of tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanism by which CAFs promote gastric cancer progression should be further explored. In our study, we found that interleukin-11 (IL-11) secretion was significantly increased when CAFs were co-cultured with gastric cancer cells. Co-culture system-derived IL-11 promoted the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells, whereas the increase of migration and invasion was attenuated by a neutralizing antibody of IL-11 or inhibition of JAK/STAT3 and MAPK/ERK pathways with specific inhibitors. Taken together, these results revealed that CAFs play a significant role in the gastric cancer progression in the tumor microenvironment through IL-11-STAT3/ERK signaling by upregulating MUC1. Also, IL-11 targeted therapy can achieve an effective treatment against gastric cancer indirectly by exerting their action on stromal fibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Prenylated flavin mononucleotide (prFMN) is a recently discovered cofactor required by the UbiD family of reversible decarboxylases involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis, biological decomposition of lignin, and biotransformation of aromatic compounds. This cofactor is synthesized by UbiX-like prenyltransferases catalyzing the transfer of the dimethylallyl moiety of dimethylallyl-monophosphate (DMAP) to FMN. The origin of DMAP for prFMN biosynthesis and the biochemical properties of free prFMN are unknown. We show that in Escherichia coli cells, DMAP can be produced by phosphorylating prenol using ThiM or dephosphorylating DMAPP using Nudix hydrolases. We produced 14 active prenyltransferases whose properties enabled the purification and characterization of protein-free forms of prFMN. In vitro assays revealed that the UbiD-like ferulate decarboxylase (Fdc1) can be activated by free prFMNiminium or C2′-hydroxylated prFMNiminium under both oxidized and reduced conditions. These insights into the biosynthesis and properties of prFMN will facilitate further elucidation of the biochemical diversity of reversible UbiD (de)carboxylases.

Abstract: Cell transplantation has been challenged in several clinical indications of genetic or acquired muscular diseases, but therapeutic success were mitigated. To understand and improve the yields of tissue regeneration, we aimed at modelling the fate of CD56-positive human myoblasts after transplantation. Using immunodeficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice as recipients, we assessed the survival, integration and satellite cell niche occupancy of human myoblasts by a triple immunohistochemical labelling of laminin, dystrophin and human lamin A/C. The counts were integrated into a classical mathematical decline equation. After injection, human cells were essentially located in the endomysium, then they disappeared progressively from D0 to D28. The final number of integrated human nuclei was grossly determined at D2 after injection, suggesting that no more efficient fusion between donor myoblasts and host fibers occurs after the resolution of the local damages created by needle insertion. Almost 1% of implanted human cells occupied a satellite-like cell niche. Our mathematical model validated by histological counting provided a reliable quantitative estimate of human myoblast survival and/or incorporation into SCID muscle fibers. Informations brought by histological labelling and this mathematical model are complementary.

Abstract: Summary
Human stem cell-derived models of development and neurodegenerative diseases are challenged by cellular immaturity in vitro. Microengineered organ-on-chip (or Organ-Chip) systems are designed to emulate microvolume cytoarchitecture and enable co-culture of distinct cell types. Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) share common signaling pathways with neurons early in development, but their contribution to human neuronal maturation is largely unknown. To study this interaction and influence of microculture, we derived both spinal motor neurons and BMECs from human induced pluripotent stem cells and observed increased calcium transient function and Chip-specific gene expression in Organ-Chips compared with 96-well plates. Seeding BMECs in the Organ-Chip led to vascular-neural interaction and specific gene activation that further enhanced neuronal function and in vivo-like signatures. The results show that the vascular system has specific maturation effects on spinal cord neural tissue, and the use of Organ-Chips can move stem cell models closer to an in vivo condition.

Abstract: Summary
The intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (L.m.) is targeted by the autophagic machinery, but the molecular mechanisms involved and consequences for anti-listerial immunity remain enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that L.m. infection of macrophages in vivo exclusively evokes LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), but not canonical autophagy, and that targeting of L.m. by LAP is required for anti-listerial immunity. The pathway leading to LAP induction in response to L.m. infection emanates from the β2 integrin Mac-1 (CR3, integrin αMβ2), a receptor recognizing diverse microbial ligands. Interaction of L.m. with Mac-1 induces acid sphingomyelinase-mediated changes in membrane lipid composition that facilitate assembly and activation of the phagocyte NAPDH oxidase Nox2. Nox2-derived reactive oxygen species then trigger LC3 recruitment to L.m.-containing phagosomes by LAP. By promoting fusion of L.m.-containing phagosomes with lysosomes, LAP increases exposure of L.m. to bactericidal acid hydrolases, thereby enhancing anti-listerial activity of macrophages and immunity of mice.

Abstract: Fibroblasts are the most abundant connective tissue cells and play an important role in wound healing. It is possible that faster and scarless wound healing in oral mucosal gingiva relative to skin may relate to the distinct phenotype of the fibroblasts residing in these tissues. Connexin 43 (Cx43) is the most ubiquitous Cx in skin (SFBLs) and gingival fibroblasts (GFBLs), and assembles into hemichannels (HCs) and gap junctions (GJs) on the cell membrane. We hypothesized that SFBLs and GFBLs display distinct expression or function of Cx43, and that this may partly underlie the different wound healing outcomes in skin and gingiva. Here we show that Cx43 distinctly formed Cx43 GJs and HCs in human skin and gingiva in vivo. However, in SFBLs, in contrast to GFBLs, only a small proportion of total Cx43 assembled into HC plaques. Using an in vivo-like 3D culture model, we further show that the GJ, HC, and channel-independent functions of Cx43 distinctly regulated wound healing-related gene expression in GFBLs and SFBLs. Therefore, the distinct wound healing outcomes in skin and gingiva may partly relate to the inherently different assembly and function of Cx43 in the resident fibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Gut epithelial organoids are routinely used to investigate intestinal biology; however, current culture methods are not amenable to genetic manipulation, and it is difficult to generate sufficient numbers for high-throughput studies. Here, we present an improved culture system of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived intestinal organoids involving four methodological advances. (1) We adopted a lentiviral vector to readily establish and optimize conditioned medium for human intestinal organoid culture. (2) We obtained intestinal organoids from human iPSCs more efficiently by supplementing WNT3A and fibroblast growth factor 2 to induce differentiation into definitive endoderm. (3) Using 2D culture, followed by re-establishment of organoids, we achieved an efficient transduction of exogenous genes in organoids. (4) We investigated suspension organoid culture without scaffolds for easier harvesting and assays. These techniques enable us to develop, maintain, and expand intestinal organoids readily and quickly at low cost, facilitating high-throughput screening of pathogenic factors and candidate treatments for gastrointestinal diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The 26S proteasome is the major proteolytic machine for breaking down cytosolic and nuclear proteins in eukaryotes. Due to the lack of a suitable assay, it is difficult to measure routinely and quantitatively the breakdown of proteins by the 26S proteasome in vitro. In the present study, we developed an assay to monitor proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Using this assay, we discovered that epidithiodiketopiperazine (ETPs) blocked the degradation of our model substrate in vitro. Further characterization revealed that ETPs inhibited proteasome function by targeting the essential proteasomal deubiquitinase Rpn11 (POH1/PSMD14). ETPs also inhibited other JAMM (JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme) proteases such as Csn5 and AMSH. An improved ETP with fewer non-specific effects, SOP11, stabilized a subset of proteasome substrates in cells, induced the unfolded protein response, and led to cell death. SOP11 represents a class of Rpn11 inhibitor and provides an alternative route to develop proteasome inhibitors.

The discovery of mutant or fusion kinases that drive oncogenesis, and the subsequent approval of specific inhibitors for these enzymes, has been instrumental in the management of some cancers. However, acquired resistance remains a significant problem in the clinic, limiting the long-term effectiveness of most of these drugs. Here we demonstrate a general strategy to overcome this resistance through drug-induced MEK cleavage (via direct procaspase-3 activation) combined with targeted kinase inhibition. This combination effect is shown to be general across diverse tumor histologies (melanoma, lung cancer, and leukemia) and driver mutations (mutant BRAF or EGFR, fusion kinases EML4-ALK and BCR-ABL). Caspase-3-mediated degradation of MEK kinases results in sustained pathway inhibition and substantially delayed or eliminated resistance in cancer cells in a manner far superior to combinations with MEK inhibitors. These data suggest the generality of drug-mediated MEK kinase cleavage as a therapeutic strategy to prevent resistance to targeted anticancer therapies.

Abstract: The HepG2 cell line is widely used in studying liver diseases because of its immortalization, but its clinical application is limited by its low expression of the urea synthesis key enzymes and cytochromes P450 (CYPs). On the basis of our previous work, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of arginase 1 (Arg1) and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) in HepG2 cells. We also screened for the optimal combination of liver enrichment transcription factors (LETFs) and xenobiotic nuclear receptors that can promote the expression of key urea synthases and five major CYPs in HepG2 cells. Thus, recombinant HepG2 cells were established. Results showed that C/EBPβ, not C/EBPα, could upregulate expression of Arg1 and PGC1α and HNF4α cooperatively regulate the expression of OTC. The two optimal combinations C/EBPβ+HNF4α+HNF6+PXR and C/EBPβ+HNF4α+HNF6+CAR were selected. Compared with the control cells, the recombinant HepG2 cells modified by the two optimal combinations exhibited enhanced ammonia metabolism and CYP enzyme activity. Moreover, the HepG2/(C/EBPβ+HNF4α+HNF6+PXR) cells more strongly reduced ammonia than any other combination tested in this study. The present work indicated that optimizing the combination of transcription factors will simultaneously promote hepatocyte ammonia metabolism and drug metabolism. The recombinant HepG2 liver cell line constructed by the optimal combination provided an improved alternative means for bioartificial liver applications and drug toxicity testing.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation is a pathophysiological response of innate immunity to infection or tissue damage. This response is among others triggered by factors released by damaged or dying cells, termed damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules that act as danger signals. DAMPs interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to contribute to the induction of inflammation. However, how released peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are able to activate PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), remains elusive. Here, we used force-distance curve-based atomic force microscopy to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which extracellular human PRDX5 can activate a proinflammatory response. Single-molecule experiments demonstrated that PRDX5 binds to purified TLR4 receptors, on macrophage-differentiated THP-1 cells, and on human TLR4-transfected CHO cells. These findings suggest that extracellular PRDX5 can specifically trigger a proinflammatory response. Moreover, our work also revealed that PRDX5 binding induces a cellular mechanoresponse. Collectively, this study provides insights into the role of extracellular PRDX5 in innate immunity.

Abstract: Numerous putative heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)-interacting proteins, which could represent novel folding clients or co-chaperones, have been identified in recent years. Two separate high-throughput screens in yeast uncovered genetic effects between Hsp90 and components of the ER membrane complex (EMC), which is required for tolerance to unfolded protein response stress in yeast. Herein, we provide the first experimental evidence supporting that there is a genuine interaction of Hsp90 with the EMC. We demonstrate genetic interactions between EMC2 and the known Hsp90 co-chaperone encoded by STI1, as well as Hsp90 point mutant allele-specific differences in inherent growth and Hsp90 inhibitor tolerance in the absence and presence of EMC2. In co-precipitation experiments, Hsp90 interacts with Emc2p, whether or not Emc2p contains amino acid sequences designated as a tetratricopeptide repeat motif. Yeast with multiple EMC gene deletions exhibit increased sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitor as well as defective folding of the well-established Hsp90 folding client, the glucocorticoid receptor. Altogether, our evidence of physical, genetic, and functional interaction of Hsp90 with the EMC, as well as bioinformatic analysis of shared interactors, supports that there is a legitimate interaction between them in vivo.

Abstract: Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is a debilitating disease resulting from the development of ectopic bone formation, which leads to the compression of the spinal cord. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) was found to be upregulated and microRNA-182 (miR-182) was downregulated in OLF tissue. We investigated the effects of NAMPT and miR-182 expression in OLF cells and the influence on proteins associated with osteogenic differentiation. MiR-182 overexpression inhibited NAMPT, RUNX2, OCN and OPN mRNA and protein expression in OLF cells. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay and Alizarin red staining confirmed reduced levels of osteogenic differentiation and mineralized nodule formation. Knockdown of NAMPT and the NAMPT inhibitor FK866 also inhibits RUNX2, OCN and OPN mRNA expression and protein levels, whereas overexpression of NAMPT promotes the expression of RUNX2, OCN and OPN and the generation of bone nodules. Dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-182 directly targets NAMPT and downregulates its expression. Transfection of OLF cells with miR-182 downregulated NAMPT and suppressed the regulation of RUNX2, OCN, and OPN by NAMPT overexpression. Overall, these data demonstrate that miR-182 suppresses OLF by downregulating NAMPT.

Abstract: Summary
Sulfur incorporation in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine, a histidine thiol derivative, differs from other well-characterized transsulfurations. A combination of a mononuclear non-heme iron enzyme-catalyzed oxidative C-S bond formation and a subsequent pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-mediated C-S lyase reaction leads to the net transfer of a sulfur atom from a cysteine to a histidine. In this study, we structurally and mechanistically characterized a PLP-dependent C-S lyase Egt2, which mediates the sulfoxide C-S bond cleavage in ergothioneine biosynthesis. A cation-π interaction between substrate and enzyme accounts for Egt2's preference of sulfoxide over thioether as a substrate. Using mutagenesis and structural biology, we captured three distinct states of the Egt2 C-S lyase reaction cycle, including a labile sulfenic intermediate captured in Egt2 crystals. Chemical trapping and high-resolution mass spectrometry were used to confirm the involvement of the sulfenic acid intermediate in Egt2 catalysis.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary supplementation with fermentable fiber suppresses adiposity and the associated parameters of metabolic syndrome. Microbiota-generated fiber-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and free fatty acid receptors including GPR43 are thought to mediate these effects. We find that while fermentable (inulin), but not insoluble (cellulose), fiber markedly protected mice against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome, the effect was not significantly impaired by either inhibiting SCFA production or genetic ablation of GPR43. Rather, HFD decimates gut microbiota, resulting in loss of enterocyte proliferation, leading to microbiota encroachment, low-grade inflammation (LGI), and metabolic syndrome. Enriching HFD with inulin restored microbiota loads, interleukin-22 (IL-22) production, enterocyte proliferation, and antimicrobial gene expression in a microbiota-dependent manner, as assessed by antibiotic and germ-free approaches. Inulin-induced IL-22 expression, which required innate lymphoid cells, prevented microbiota encroachment and protected against LGI and metabolic syndrome. Thus, fermentable fiber protects against metabolic syndrome by nourishing microbiota to restore IL-22-mediated enterocyte function.

Abstract: In a previous study, we showed that microRNA-675 (miR-675) was significantly down-regulated in patients with tricho-dento-osseous (TDO) syndrome. One of the main features of TDO syndrome is dentin hypoplasia. Thus, we hypothesize that miR-675 plays a role in dentin development. In this study, we determined the role of miR-675 in the odontogenic differentiation of human dental pulp cells (hDPCs). Stable overexpression and knockdown of miR-675 in hDPCs were performed using recombinant lentiviruses containing U6 promoter-driven miR-675 and short hairpin-miR675 expression cassettes, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay, Alizarin red staining assay, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescent staining revealed the promotive effects of miR-675 on the odontogenic differentiation of hDPCs. Further, we found that miR-675 facilitates the odontogenic differentiation process of hDPCs by epigenetic regulation of distal-less homeobox (DLX3). Thus, for the first time, we determined that miR-675 regulates the odontogenic differentiation of hDPCs by inhibiting the DNA methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B)-mediated methylation of DLX3. Our findings uncover an unanticipated regulatory role for miR-675 in the odontogenic differentiation of hDPCs by epigenetic changes in DLX3 and provide novel insight into dentin hypoplasia feature in TDO patients.

Abstract: Summary
The differentiation of dopaminergic neurons requires concerted action of morphogens and transcription factors acting in a precise and well-defined time window. Very little is known about the potential role of microRNA in these events. By performing a microRNA-mRNA paired microarray screening, we identified miR-34b/c among the most upregulated microRNAs during dopaminergic differentiation. Interestingly, miR-34b/c modulates Wnt1 expression, promotes cell cycle exit, and induces dopaminergic differentiation. When combined with transcription factors ASCL1 and NURR1, miR-34b/c doubled the yield of transdifferentiated fibroblasts into dopaminergic neurons. Induced dopaminergic (iDA) cells synthesize dopamine and show spontaneous electrical activity, reversibly blocked by tetrodotoxin, consistent with the electrophysiological properties featured by brain dopaminergic neurons. Our findings point to a role for miR-34b/c in neuronal commitment and highlight the potential of exploiting its synergy with key transcription factors in enhancing in vitro generation of dopaminergic neurons.

Abstract: Summary
DUOX, a member of the NADPH oxidase family, acts as the first line of defense against enteric pathogens by producing microbicidal reactive oxygen species. DUOX is activated upon enteric infection, but the mechanisms regulating DUOX activity remain incompletely understood. Using Drosophila genetic tools, we show that enteric infection results in “pro-catabolic” signaling that initiates metabolic reprogramming of enterocytes toward lipid catabolism, which ultimately governs DUOX homeostasis. Infection induces signaling cascades involving TRAF3 and kinases AMPK and WTS, which regulate TOR kinase to control the balance of lipogenesis versus lipolysis. Enhancing lipogenesis blocks DUOX activity, whereas stimulating lipolysis via ATG1-dependent lipophagy is required for DUOX activation. Drosophila with altered activity in TRAF3-AMPK/WTS-ATG1 pathway components exhibit abolished infection-induced lipolysis, reduced DUOX activation, and enhanced susceptibility to enteric infection. Thus, this work uncovers signaling cascades governing inflammation-induced metabolic reprogramming and provides insight into the pathophysiology of immune-metabolic interactions in the microbe-laden gut epithelia.

Abstract: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is widely activated in cancers. The mammalian UPR encompasses three signaling branches, namely inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α), protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6α (ATF6α). The functional significance of each branch in tumorigenesis is incompletely understood, especially in cancer stem cells (CSCs). Here, we report that inhibition and silencing of the three UPR sensors has differential effects on breast cancer growth and the CSC population. The levels of PERK and ATF6α strongly correlate with the expression of sex determining region Y (SRY)-box 2 (SOX2), a pluripotency regulator, in human breast cancer tissues. UPR activation is also elevated in the CSC-enriched mammospheres. Inhibition of the UPR sensors or excess ER stress markedly reduces the formation and maintenance of mammospheres, suggesting that an appropriate level of UPR activation is critical for the CSC survival. Mechanistically, transcription factors from UPR and pluripotency pathways interact and reciprocally influence each other. A transcription modulator, CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein delta (C/EBPδ), interacts with pluripotency regulator, SOX2, and UPR transcription factors, thus likely serving as a link to coordinate UPR and pluripotency maintenance in CSCs. Our findings demonstrate that UPR is critical for both cancer growth and pluripotency, and highlight the differential role and complexity of the three UPR branches in tumorigenesis.

Abstract: The Wnt/JNK pathway, responsible for tissue polarity in cardiogenesis in vertebrates, has been shown to play numerous roles during differentiation and development of cardiac myocytes. Van Gogh-like-2 (Vangl2) is a core component that regulates the induction of polarized cellular and tissue morphology during animal development. However, little is known about Wnt/JNK signaling pathway in the process of myocardial remodeling. In present study, we found that activation of Wnt/JNK signaling by Wnt5a stimulates enlargement of cardiomyocyte surface area. The hypertrophic features were inhibited in Vangl2 depleted cells. Meanwhile, Wnt/JNK activation induced cytoskeleton rearrangement but failed to activate these effects in cells lacking Vangl2. Moreover, Wnt/JNK activation significantly increased the cell apoptosis by mediating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) dysfunction, whereas knockdown of Vangl2 partly reversed these effects. These results suggest that activation of Wnt/JNK signaling stimulates myocardial remodeling (cell morphological changes, apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction), in which Vangl2 may play an essential role.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies have linked polymorphisms in the autophagy gene ATG16L1 with susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the cell-type-specific effects of autophagy on the regulation of chronic intestinal inflammation have not been investigated. Here, we assessed the effect of myeloid-specific or intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of Atg16l1 on chronic colitis triggered by the intestinal opportunistic pathogen Helicobacter hepaticus in mice. Although Atg16l1 deficiency in myeloid cells had little effect on disease, mice selectively lacking Atg16l1 in IECs (Atg16l1VC) developed severely exacerbated pathology, accompanied by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and increased IEC apoptosis. Using ex vivo IEC organoids, we demonstrate that autophagy intrinsically controls TNF-induced apoptosis and in vivo blockade of TNF attenuated the exacerbated pathology in Atg16l1VC mice. These findings suggest that the IBD susceptibility gene ATG16L1 and the process of autophagy within the epithelium control inflammation-induced apoptosis and barrier integrity to limit chronic intestinal inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Yin Yang 1 (YY1) regulates early embryogenesis and adult tissue formation. However, the role of YY1 in stem cell regulation remains unclear. YY1 has a Polycomb group (PcG) protein-dependent role in mammalian cells. The PcG-independent functions of YY1 are also reported, although their underlying mechanism is still undefined. This paper reports the role of YY1 and BAF complex in the OCT4-mediated pluripotency network in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). The interaction between YY1 and BAF complex promotes mESC proliferation and pluripotency. Knockdown of Yy1 or Smarca4, the core component of the BAF complex, downregulates pluripotency markers and upregulates several differentiation markers. Moreover, YY1 enriches at both promoter and super-enhancer regions to stimulate transcription. Thus, this study elucidates the role of YY1 in regulating pluripotency through its interaction with OCT4 and the BAF complex and the role of BAF complex in integrating YY1 into the core pluripotency network.

Abstract: Summary
Candida albicans bloodstream infection causes fungal septicaemia and death in over half of afflicted patients. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) mediate defense against invasive candidiasis, but their role in protection versus tissue injury and sepsis is unclear. We observe PMN intravascular swarming and subsequent clustering in response to C. albicans yeast in a lethal septic mouse and human pulmonary circulation model. Live C. albicans sequester to the endothelium and are immediately captured by complement-dependent PMN chemotaxis, which is required for host survival. However, complement activation also leads to Leukotriene B4 (LTB4)-mediated intravascular PMN clustering and occlusion, resulting in capillaritis with pulmonary hemorrhage and hypoxemia. This clustering is unique to fungi and triggered by fungal cell wall components. PMN clustering is absent in mice lacking LTB4-receptor, and capillaritis is attenuated upon pharmacological LTB4 blockade without affecting phagocytosis. Therefore, therapeutically disrupting infection-induced capillaritis may limit organ injury without impairing host defense during fungal sepsis.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess the functional role of SPARC in T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (T-NHL), as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we first identified SPARC expression in T-NHL tissues and cell lines through western blot and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Overall survival of T-NHL patients with different levels of SPARC was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Then cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of T-NHL cells with either knockdown or overexpression of SPARC were determined by MTT, flow cytometry, transwell migration and invasion assay, respectively. Finally, the molecular mechanism by which SPARC modulated T-NHL cell progression was assessed. We confirmed that SPARC was significantly down-regulated in T-NHL tissues and cell lines. T-NHL patients with high levels of SPARC demonstrated a favorable clinical outcome. SPARC significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and EMT process, but facilitated cell apoptosis in T-NHL cells. Further, we found that loss of SPARC expression in T-NHL tissues and cell lines, both in mRNA and protein levels, was associated with the aberrant DNA methylation in SPRAC gene, and the disrupted SPARC expression could be rescued after treatment with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2′-deoxycitydine (5-Aza-Cdr). Additionally, 5-Aza-Cdr reversed SPARC hypermethylation to restore its biological role as a tumor suppressor in T-NHL cells, including inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion and migration, while promoting cell apoptosis. Our data provided evidence that DNA methylation in SPARC gene may play a role in the progression of T-NHL.

Here, we attempt to bypass limitations of abundant tumor source and predetermined immune selection by in vivo propagating patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from human malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), a rare and lethal pediatric neoplasm, to an advanced state in which most cells behave as CSCs. Stemness is then probed by comparative transcriptomics of serial PDXs generating a gene signature of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, invasion/motility, metastasis, and self-renewal, pinpointing putative MRT CSC markers. The relevance of these putative CSC molecules is analyzed by sorting tumorigenic fractions from early-passaged PDX according to one such molecule, deciphering expression in archived primary tumors, and testing the effects of CSC molecule inhibition on MRT growth. Using this platform, we identify ALDH1 and lysyl oxidase (LOX) as relevant targets and provide a larger framework for target and drug discovery in rare pediatric cancers.

Abstract: Osteoblasts are adherent cells, and under physiological conditions they attach to both mineralized and non-mineralized osseous surfaces. However, how exactly osteoblasts respond to these different osseous surfaces is largely unknown. Our hypothesis was that the state of matrix mineralization provides a functional signal to osteoblasts. To assess the osteoblast response to mineralized compared to demineralized osseous surfaces, we developed and validated a novel tissue surface model. We demonstrated that with the exception of the absence of mineral, the mineralized and demineralized surfaces were similar in molecular composition as determined, for example, by collagen content and maturity. Subsequently, we used the human osteoblastic cell line MG63 in combination with genome-wide gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to record and compare the gene expression signatures on mineralized and demineralized surfaces. Assessment of the 5 most significant gene sets showed on mineralized surfaces an enrichment exclusively of genes sets linked to protein synthesis, while on the demineralized surfaces 3 of the 5 enriched gene sets were associated with the matrix. Focusing on these three gene sets, we observed not only the expected structural components of the bone matrix, but also gene products, such as HMCN1 or NID2, that are likely to act as temporal migration guides. Together, these findings suggest that in osteoblasts mineralized and demineralized osseous surfaces favor intracellular protein production and matrix formation, respectively. Further, they demonstrate that the mineralization state of bone independently controls gene expression in osteoblastic cells.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely studied in the field of regenerative medicine with the potential to solve osteoporosis. Paired box 2 (Pax2), as a transcription factor, is the master regulator of embryogenesis and oncogenesis. However, the function of Pax2 in osteogenesis is unknown. Here, we reported for the first time that the expression of Pax2 gradually increased during osteogenic differentiation of mouse MSCs, and osteoprogenitor cells. However, detected in osteoblastic cells of mouse tibia, the expression of Pax2 in the embryonic stage was higher than that in adulthood. In C3H/10/T1/2 cells and compact bone-derived mouse MSCs (mMSCs), Pax2 knock-down inhibited the proliferation of these cells, down-regulated the expression of osteogenic marker genes, as well as repressed the ALP activity and mineralization. In addition, Pax2 enhanced the transcriptional activity of Runx2, and activated the MAPK pathway genes (ERK, JNK and p38). Furthermore, knock-down of Pax2 repressed the mMSCs-mediated bone regeneration in an ectopic bone formation model. In conclusion, Pax2 promotes osteogenesis of mouse MSCs, suggesting that Pax2 has a role in the pathophysiology of bone related diseases, and has potential application in bone tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia caused by advanced neuronal dysfunction and death. The most significant symptoms of AD are observed at late stages of the disease when interventions are most likely too late to ameliorate the condition. Currently, the predominant theory for AD is the “amyloid hypothesis,” which states that abnormally increased levels of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides result in the production of a variety of aggregates that are neurotoxic. The specific mechanisms for Aβ peptide-induced cytotoxicity have not yet been completely elucidated. However, since the majority of Aβ is released into the extracellular milieu, it is reasonable to assume that toxicity begins outside the cells and makes its way inside where it disrupts the basic cellular process resulting in cell death. There is increasing evidence that hsp, particularly Hsp70, are exported into the extracellular milieu by an active export mechanism independent of cell death. Therefore, both Aβ peptides and Hsp70 may coexist in a common environment during pathological conditions. We observed that Hsp70 affected the Aβ assembling process in vitro preventing oligomer formation. Moreover, the presence of Hsp70 reduced the Aβ peptide-induced toxicity of cultured neurons (N2A cells). These results suggest a potential mechanism for the reduction of the detrimental effects of Aβ peptides in AD.

Abstract: Summary
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) offers curative potential for patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies, but the post-transplantation period is characterized by profound immunodeficiency. Recent studies indicate that the intestinal microbiota not only regulates mucosal immunity, but can also contribute to systemic immunity and hematopoiesis. Using antibiotic-mediated microbiota depletion in a syngeneic BMT mouse model, here we describe a role for the intestinal flora in hematopoietic recovery after BMT. Depletion of the intestinal microbiota resulted in impaired recovery of lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, while recovery of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor compartments and the erythroid lineage were largely unaffected. Depletion of the intestinal microbiota also reduced dietary energy uptake and visceral fat stores. Caloric supplementation through sucrose in the drinking water improved post-BMT hematopoietic recovery in mice with a depleted intestinal flora. Taken together, we show that the intestinal microbiota contribute to post-BMT hematopoietic reconstitution in mice through improved dietary energy uptake.

Abstract: SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has been reported to restrain prostate cancer growth both in vitro and in vivo, however, its role in metastatic prostate cancer has not been revealed. In this study, we reported that SIRT3 inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of prostatic cancer cells in vitro and their metastasis in vivo. Consistently, based on analyses of tissue microarray and microarray datasets, lower SIRT3 expression level was correlated with higher prostate cancer Gleason scores, and SIRT3 expression were significantly decreased in metastatic tissues compared with prostate tumor tissues. Mechanistically, SIRT3 promoted FOXO3A expression by attenuating Wnt/β-catenin pathway, thereby inhibiting EMT and migration of prostate cancer cells. Indeed, SIRT3's inhibitory effect on EMT and migration of prostate cancer cells can be rescued after applying Wnt/β-catenin pathway activator LiCl, or boosted by wnt inhibitor XAV939. Together, this study revealed a novel mechanism for prostate cancer metastasis that involves SIRT3/ Wnt/β-catenin/ FOXO3A signaling to modulate EMT and cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Plants initiate immunity by cell-surface pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which perceive non-self molecules. PRRs are predominantly receptor serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases that are evolutionarily related to animal interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)/Pelle-soluble kinases. However, how the activity of these receptor kinases is modulated remains poorly understood. We report that the Arabidopsis PRR chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (CERK1) is autophosphorylated in unstimulated cells at tyrosine428 (Tyr428), a modification that is required for CERK1 activation upon binding to the fungal cell wall component chitin. Upon chitin activation, CERK1 recruits the CERK1-interacting protein phosphatase 1 (CIPP1), a predicted Ser/Thr phosphatase, to dephosphorylate Tyr428 and dampen CERK1 signaling. CIPP1 subsequently dissociates from Tyr428-dephosphorylated CERK1, allowing CERK1 to regain Tyr428 autophosphorylation and return to a standby state. This work sheds light onto plant chitin signaling and shows that a receptor kinase and phosphatase can coordinately regulate signal transduction of a receptor kinase through a phosphorylation cycle.

Abstract: It has been found that Helicobacter pylori （H. pylori）is not only the main cause of gastric cancer, but also closely related to its metastasis. E-cadherin cleavage induced by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) plays an important role in the tumor metastasis. In the present study, we investigated the role of microRNAs-MMPs-E-cadherin in migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells treated with H. pylori. The results showed that H. pylori induced migration and invasion of SGC-7901 cells with a down-regulation of E-cadherin expression, which were abolished by MMPs knock down, E-cadherin overexpression, mimics of miR128 and miR148a. MiR128/miR148a inhibitors restored MMP-3/MMP-7 expression, down-regulated E-cadherin level, and accelerated cellular migration and invasion. This study suggests that H. pylori induces migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells through reduction of E-cadherin function by activation of MMP-3, − 7. The present results also suggest that the activated MMPs/E-cadherin pathway is related with down-regulation of miR128/miR148a in the human gastric cancer cells infected with H. pylori.

Abstract: The skin constantly self-renews throughout adult life. Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a key role in promoting keratinocyte proliferation in the hair follicles and in the interfollicular epidermis. A recent report demonstrated that epidermal YAP activity drives β-catenin activation to promote keratinocyte proliferation in the murine skin. However, it remains unclear whether this is caused by paracrine activation of canonical Wnt signaling or through other YAP/β-catenin regulatory interactions. In the present study, we found that XAV939-inhibition of canonical WNT signaling in skin of YAP2-5SA-ΔC mice resulted in diminished β-catenin activation, reduced keratinocyte proliferation, and a mitigation of the hyperplastic abnormalities in the interfollicular epidermis, signifying a canonical WNT ligand-dependent mechanism. Our subsequent analyses determined that WNT16 is produced in response to YAP activity in keratinocytes both in vitro and in vivo, and that WNT16 drives HaCaT keratinocyte proliferation via canonical WNT16/β-catenin signaling. We conclude that under normal physiological conditions WNT16 is the paracrine WNT ligand secreted in response to epidermal YAP activity that promotes cell proliferation in the interfollicular epidermis. This study delineates a fundamental YAP-driven mechanism that controls normal skin regeneration, and that may be perturbed in human regenerative disease displaying increased YAP and WNT signaling activity.

Abstract: Summary
It is generally thought that the proliferative capacity and differentiation potential of somatic stem cells, including mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells, decline with age. We investigated the effects of aging on human bone-derived MSCs expressing CD271 and SSEA-4 (double-positive MSCs [DPMSCs]). The percentages of DPMSCs in bone tissue decreased significantly with age. The DPMSCs from elderly patients (old DPMSCs) showed cellular senescence, which was evidenced by low growth potential, high senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, and elevated p16 and p21 CDK inhibitor levels. Moreover, old DPMSCs showed weak osteogenic differentiation potential and less hematopoiesis-supporting activity in comparison with young DPMSCs. Interestingly, the addition of transforming growth factor β2 (TGF-β2) induced cellular senescence in young DPMSCs. With the exception of the adipogenic differentiation potential, all of the aging phenomena observed in old DPMSCs were reversed by the addition of anti-TGF-β antibodies. These results suggest that, in part, old DPMSCs accelerate cellular senescence through TGF-β signaling.

Abstract: Summary
4ʹ-Ethynyl-2-fluoro-2ʹ-deoxyadenosine (EFdA/MK-8591), a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) under clinical trials, is a potent and promising long-acting anti-HIV type 1 (HIV-1) agent. EFdA and its derivatives possess a modified 4ʹ-moiety and potently inhibit the replication of a wide spectrum of HIV-1 strains resistant to existing NRTIs. Here, we report that EFdA and NRTIs with a 4ʹ-ethynyl- or 4ʹ-cyano-moiety exerted activity against HIV-1 with an M184V mutation and multiple NRTI-resistant HIV-1s, whereas NRTIs with other moieties (e.g., 4ʹ-methyl) did not show this activity. Structural analysis indicated that EFdA and 4ʹ-ethynyl-NRTIs (but not other 4ʹ-modified NRTIs), formed strong van der Waals interactions with critical amino acid residues of reverse transcriptase. Such interactions were maintained even in the presence of a broad resistance-endowing M184V substitution, thus potently inhibiting drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. These findings also explain the mechanism for the potency of EFdA and provide insights for further design of anti-HIV-1 therapeutics.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) constitute a large, diverse, and functionally uncharacterized family of heat shock proteins. To gain insight regarding the function of sHSPs in insects, we identified genes encoding two sHSPs, Cshsp22.9b and Cshsp24.3, from the rice pest Chilo suppressalis. The cDNAs of Cshsp22.9b and Cshsp24.3 encoded proteins of 206 and 216 amino acids with isoelectric points of 5.79 and 9.28, respectively. Further characterization indicated that both Cshsp22.9b and Cshsp24.3 lacked introns. Real-time quantitative PCR indicated that Cshsp22.9b and Cshsp24.3 were expressed at higher levels within the fat body as compared to other tissues (head, epidermis, foregut, midgut, hindgut, Malpighian tubules, and hemocytes). Expression of Cshsp22.9b and Cshsp24.3 was lowest in the hindgut and Malpighian tubules, respectively. Cshsp22.9b and Cshsp24.3 showed identical patterns in response to thermal stress from −11 to 43 °C, and both genes were up-regulated by hot and cold temperatures. The mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) expression levels of Cshsp22.9b (KY701308) and Cshsp24.3 (KY701309) were highest after a 2-h exposure at 39°C and started to decline at 42 °C. In response to cold temperatures, both Cshsp22.9b and Cshsp24.3 showed maximal expression after a 2-h exposure to −3 °C. The two Cshsps were more responsive to hot than cold temperature stress and were not induced by mildly cold or warm temperatures. In conclusion, Cshsp22.9b and Cshsp24.3 could play a very important role in the regulation of physiological activities in C. suppressalis that are impacted by environmental stimuli.

Abstract: This paper describes a method to construct three-dimensional (3D) contractile human skeletal muscle tissues from a cell line. The 3D tissue was fabricated as a fiber-based structure and cultured for two weeks under tension by anchoring its both ends. While myotubes from the immortalized human skeletal myocytes used in this study never contracted in the conventional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer culture, myotubes in the 3D tissue showed spontaneous contraction at a high frequency and also reacted to the electrical stimulation. Immunofluorescence revealed that the myotubes in the 3D tissues had sarcomeres and expressed ryanodine receptor (RyR) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). In addition, intracellular calcium oscillations in the myotubes in the 3D tissue were observed. These results indicated that the 3D culture enabled the myocyte cell line to reach a more highly matured state compared to 2D culture. Since contraction is the most significant feature of skeletal muscle, we believe that our 3D human muscle tissue with the contractile ability would be a useful tool for both basic biology research and drug discovery as one of the muscle-on-chips.

Abstract: Summary
Disorders of the biliary epithelium, known as cholangiopathies, cause severe and irreversible liver diseases. The limited accessibility of bile duct precludes modeling of several cholangiocyte-mediated diseases. Therefore, novel approaches for obtaining functional cholangiocytes with high purity are needed. Previous work has shown that the combination of Hnf1β and Foxa3 could directly convert mouse fibroblasts into bipotential hepatic stem cell-like cells, termed iHepSCs. However, the efficiency of converting fibroblasts into iHepSCs is low, and these iHepSCs exhibit extremely low differentiation potential into cholangiocytes, thus hindering the translation of iHepSCs to the clinic. Here, we describe that the expression of Hnf1α and Foxa3 dramatically facilitates the robust generation of iHepSCs. Notably, prolonged in vitro culture of Hnf1α- and Foxa3-derived iHepSCs induces a Notch signaling-mediated secondary conversion into cholangiocyte progenitor-like cells that display dramatically enhanced differentiation capacity into mature cholangiocytes. Our study provides a robust two-step approach for obtaining cholangiocyte progenitor-like cells using defined factors.

Abstract: Regulating the residence time of membrane proteins on the cell surface can modify their response to extracellular cues and allow for cellular adaptation in response to changing environmental conditions. The fate of membrane proteins that are internalized from the plasma membrane and arrive at the limiting membrane of the late endosome/multivesicular body (MVB) is dictated by whether they remain on the limiting membrane, bud into internal MVB vesicles, or bud outwardly from the membrane. The molecular details underlying the disposition of membrane proteins that transit this pathway and the mechanisms regulating these trafficking events are unclear. We established a cell-free system that reconstitutes budding of membrane protein cargo into internal MVB vesicles and onto vesicles that bud outwardly from the MVB membrane. Both budding reactions are cytosol-dependent and supported by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) cytosol. We observed that inward and outward budding from the MVB membrane are mechanistically distinct but may be linked, such that inhibition of inward budding triggers a re-routing of cargo from inward to outward budding vesicles, without affecting the number of vesicles that bud outwardly from MVBs.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant hedgehog (Hh) signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple cancers. Available inhibitors target Smoothened (Smo), which can acquire mutations causing drug resistance. Thus, compounds that inhibit Hh signaling downstream of Smo are urgently needed. We identified dynarrestin, a novel inhibitor of cytoplasmic dyneins 1 and 2. Dynarrestin acts reversibly to inhibit cytoplasmic dynein 1-dependent microtubule binding and motility in vitro without affecting ATP hydrolysis. It rapidly and reversibly inhibits endosome movement in living cells and perturbs mitosis by inducing spindle misorientation and pseudoprometaphase delay. Dynarrestin reversibly inhibits cytoplasmic dynein 2-dependent intraflagellar transport (IFT) of the cargo IFT88 and flux of Smo within cilia without interfering with ciliogenesis and suppresses Hh-dependent proliferation of neuronal precursors and tumor cells. As such, dynarrestin is a valuable tool for probing cytoplasmic dynein-dependent cellular processes and a promising compound for medicinal chemistry programs aimed at development of anti-cancer drugs.

Abstract: Obese patients, often accompanied by hyperleptinemia, are prone to liver fibrogenesis. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone and plays a promotion role in liver fibrosis. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) exerts a crucial role in inhibiting hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, a key step in liver fibrogenesis. Our previous studies indicated that leptin inhibited SREBP1c expression, contributing to leptin-induced HSC activation and liver fibrosis. microRNAs (miR) have emerged as important layers of regulatory control and regulate gene expression, and are implicated in numerous diseases. The present study revealed leptin up-regulation of miR-27a/b-3p levels in HSCs in vitro and in vivo. Three signaling pathways were required for leptin regulation of miR-27a/b-3p levels. miR-27a/b-3p could reduce SREBP1c and liver x receptor α (LXRα) levels, increased α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA, a marker for HSC activation) and α1(I)collagen levels in cultured HSCs. miR-27a/b-3p regulation of SREBP1c and LXRα were independent of 3′-untranslated region of SREBP1c and LXRα mRNA. In vivo experiments further demonstrated the miR-27a/b-3p involved in leptin-associated decrease in SREBP1 level in HSCs, HSC activation, and liver fibrosis. These data might have potential implications for our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying leptin roles in liver fibrogenesis of obese patients with hyperleptinaemia.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived kidney organoids may facilitate disease modeling and the generation of tissue for renal replacement. Long-term application, however, will require transferability between hPSC lines and significant improvements in organ maturation. A key question is whether time or a patent vasculature is required for ongoing morphogenesis. Here, we show that hPSC-derived kidney organoids, derived in fully defined medium conditions and in the absence of any exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor, develop host-derived vascularization. In vivo imaging of organoids under the kidney capsule confirms functional glomerular perfusion as well as connection to pre-existing vascular networks in the organoids. Wide-field electron microscopy demonstrates that transplantation results in formation of a glomerular basement membrane, fenestrated endothelial cells, and podocyte foot processes. Furthermore, compared with non-transplanted organoids, polarization and segmental specialization of tubular epithelium are observed. These data demonstrate that functional vascularization is required for progressive morphogenesis of human kidney organoids.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-initiating cells (CICs) have been implicated in tumor development and aggressiveness. In ovarian carcinoma (OC), CICs drive tumor formation, dissemination, and recurrence, as well as drug resistance, thus accounting for the high death-to-incidence ratio of this neoplasm. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie such a pathogenic role of ovarian CICs (OCICs) remain elusive. Here, we have capitalized on primary cells either from OC or from its tissues of origin to obtain the transcriptomic profile associated with OCICs. Among the genes differentially expressed in OCICs, we focused on CD73, which encodes the membrane-associated 5′-ectonucleotidase. The genetic inactivation of CD73 in OC cells revealed that this molecule is causally involved in sphere formation and tumor initiation, thus emerging as a driver of OCIC function. Furthermore, functional inhibition of CD73 via either a chemical compound or a neutralizing antibody reduced sphere formation and tumorigenesis, highlighting the druggability of CD73 in the context of OCIC-directed therapies. The biological function of CD73 in OCICs required its enzymatic activity and involved adenosine signaling. Mechanistically, CD73 promotes the expression of stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated genes, implying a regulation of OCIC function at the transcriptional level. CD73, therefore, is involved in OCIC biology and may represent a therapeutic target for innovative treatments aimed at OC eradication.

Abstract: The current study aimed to test the effect of Moringa oleifera extract (MOE), vitamin (Vit) C, and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) on heat stress (HS)-induced alterations in rabbits. Five groups of rabbits were designed as control, HS, HS + MOE, HS + Vit C, and HS + NaHCO3. HS groups were exposed to high temperatures, while treatments were given in drinking water for 6 weeks. Levels of blood cortisol, leptin, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10 were assayed using ELISA, while adrenaline was assayed calorimetrically. Expression of HSP70, FOXP3, T cell receptor (TCR) γ, and δ mRNA was tested using real-time (RT)-PCR, while HSP70 protein expression was tested using western blotting in liver and kidney tissues. Infiltration of regulatory T cells (Treg; CD25+) and NK (CD56+) cells were tested using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The levels of liver enzymes (ALT & AST), urea, and creatinine were assayed calorimetrically, while body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated. The results showed increased levels of cortisol, adrenaline, leptin, IFN-γ, TNF-α, ALT, AST, urea, and creatinine but decreased IL-10 in the HS group. Increased expression of HSP70 on both mRNA and protein levels was associated with increased NK and γδ T cells versus decreased Treg cell infiltration in liver and kidney tissues of the HS group. In the same group, BWG was decreased, while FCR was increased with respect to the control group. All treatments used in this study reversed the effects of HS significantly. In conclusion, MOE, Vit C, and NaHCO3 can be added to rabbit diets for the amelioration of HS-induced symptoms.

Common traffic routes for imported spermine and endosomal glypican-1-derived heparan sulfate in fibroblasts,

Abstract: Import of the polyamine spermine from the extracellular environment depends on the presence of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, such as glypican-1. This proteoglycan is internalized by endocytosis, releases its heparan sulfate chains in endosomes by a nitric oxide-, copper- and amyloid precursor protein-dependent mechanism, then penetrates the membrane and is transported to the nucleus and then to autophagosomes. This process is spontaneous or induced by ascorbate depending on the growth-state of the cell. Here, we have explored possible connections between the heparan sulfate traffic route and spermine uptake and delivery in wild-type and Tg2576 mouse fibroblasts. Cells were examined by deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy. The antibodies used were specific for spermine, glypican-1-derived heparan sulfate, Rab7, nucleolin and a marker for autophagosomes. Endogenous immunostainable spermine was primarily associated with autophagosomes. When spermine synthesis was inhibited, imported spermine appeared in Rab7-positive endosomes. When ascorbate was added, heparan sulfate and spermine were transported to the nucleus where they colocalized with nucleolin. Spermine also appeared in autophagosomes. In a pulse-chase experiment, heparan sulfate and spermine were first arrested in late endosomes by actinomycin D treatment. During the chase, when arrest was abolished, heparan sulfate and spermine were both transported to the nucleus and targeted nucleolin. In amyloid precursor protein-/--fibroblasts, ascorbate failed to induce release of heparan sulfate and spermine remained in the endosomes. We propose that cell surface glypican-1 carries spermine to the endosomes and that the released heparan sulfate carries spermine across the membrane into the cytosol and then to the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an irreversible, inherited retinopathy in which early-onset nyctalopia is observed. Despite the genetic heterogeneity of RP, RPGR mutations are the most common causes of this disease. Here, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from three RP patients with different frameshift mutations in the RPGR gene, which were then differentiated into retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and well-structured retinal organoids possessing electrophysiological properties. We observed significant defects in photoreceptor in terms of morphology, localization, transcriptional profiling, and electrophysiological activity. Furthermore, shorted cilium was found in patient iPSCs, RPE cells, and three-dimensional retinal organoids. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated correction of RPGR mutation rescued photoreceptor structure and electrophysiological property, reversed the observed ciliopathy, and restored gene expression to a level in accordance with that in the control using transcriptome-based analysis. This study recapitulated the pathogenesis of RPGR using patient-specific organoids and achieved targeted gene therapy of RPGR mutations in a dish as proof-of-concept evidence.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium infection begins with the bite of an anopheline mosquito, when sporozoites along with saliva are injected into a vertebrate host. The role of the host responses to mosquito saliva components in malaria remains unclear. We observed that antisera against Anopheles gambiae salivary glands partially protected mice from mosquito-borne Plasmodium infection. Specifically, antibodies to A. gambiae TRIO (AgTRIO), a mosquito salivary gland antigen, contributed to the protection. Mice administered AgTRIO antiserum showed lower Plasmodium liver burden and decreased parasitemia when exposed to infected mosquitoes. Active immunization with AgTRIO was also partially protective against Plasmodium berghei infection. A combination of AgTRIO antiserum and antibodies against Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein, a vaccine candidate, further decreased P. berghei infection. In humanized mice, AgTRIO antiserum afforded some protection against mosquito-transmitted Plasmodium falciparum. AgTRIO antiserum reduced the movement of sporozoites in the murine dermis. AgTRIO may serve as an arthropod-based target against Plasmodium to combat malaria.

High glucose-induced defective thrombospondin-1 release from astrocytes via TLR9 activation contributes to the synaptic protein loss,

Abstract: Diabetes, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, is known to induce synaptic degeneration in the brain, thereby resulting in cognitive dysfunction. Thrombospondin-1(TSP-1), the secreted protein produced by astrocytes, plays a crucial role in promoting synapse formation. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) has been widely known to initiate the innate immune response. We recently reported TLR9 activation in neurons results in tau hyperphosphorylation induced by HG in vitro. Its activation has been also considered to mediate oxidative stress and astrocytic dysfunction under pathological circumstance. However, whether astrocytic TSP-1 alteration plays a role in synaptic protein loss under high glucose condition and whether TLR9 activation is involved in this process have not been reported. In this study, we found that primary mouse astrocytes incubated in high glucose (30mM) induced a significant decreased TSP-1 secretion and increased intracellular contents of TSP-1 without affecting transcription level. Addition of conditioned medium from high glucose (30mM) treated astrocytes to the primary neurons exhibited reduced synaptic proteins expression, which was attenuated by treatment with exogenous rTSP-1. In addition, we demonstrated that TLR9 activation along with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in astrocytes was induced by high glucose (30mM). Furthermore, we explored the relationship between TLR9 activation and TSP-1 production. Both TLR9 deficiency and the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine treatment improved altered intra- and extracellular TSP-1 levels under high glucose condition. Together, our findings suggest that high glucose (30mM) impairs TSP-1 secretion from astrocytes, which depends on astrocytic dysfunction associated with TLR9 activation mediated ROS signaling, ultimately contributing to the synaptic proteins loss.

Abstract: Summary
The current study aimed to understand the developmental mechanisms regulating bud tip progenitor cells in the human fetal lung, which are present during branching morphogenesis, and to use this information to induce a bud tip progenitor-like population from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro. We identified cues that maintained isolated human fetal lung epithelial bud tip progenitor cells in vitro and induced three-dimensional hPSC-derived organoids with bud tip-like domains. Bud tip-like domains could be isolated, expanded, and maintained as a nearly homogeneous population. Molecular and cellular comparisons revealed that hPSC-derived bud tip-like cells are highly similar to native lung bud tip progenitors. hPSC-derived epithelial bud tip-like structures survived in vitro for over 16 weeks, could be easily frozen and thawed, maintained multilineage potential, and successfully engrafted into the airways of immunocompromised mouse lungs, where they persisted for up to 6 weeks and gave rise to several lung epithelial lineages.

Abstract: The process of tissue morphogenesis, especially for tissues reliant on the establishment of a specific cytoarchitecture for their functionality, depends a balanced interplay between cytoskeletal elements and their interactions with cell adhesion molecules. The microtubule cytoskeleton, which has many roles in the cell, is a determinant of directional cell migration, a process that underlies many aspects of development. We investigated the role of microtubules in development of the lens, a tissue where cell elongation underlies morphogenesis. Our studies with the microtubule depolymerizing agent nocodazole revealed an essential function for the acetylated population of stable microtubules in the elongation of lens fiber cells, which was linked to their regulation of the activation state of myosin. Suppressing myosin activation with the inhibitor blebbistatin could attenuate the loss of acetylated microtubules by nocodazole and rescue the effect of this microtubule depolymerization agent on both fiber cell elongation and lens integrity. Our results also suggest that acetylated microtubules impact lens morphogenesis through their interaction with N-cadherin junctions, with which they specifically associate in the region where lens fiber cell elongate. Disruption of the stable microtubule network increased N-cadherin junctional organization along lateral borders of differentiating lens fiber cells, which was prevented by suppression of myosin activity. These results reveal a role for the stable microtubule population in lens fiber cell elongation, acting in tandem with N-cadherin cell-cell junctions and the actomyosin network, giving insight into the cooperative role these systems play in tissue morphogenesis.

Abstract: The 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) is over-expressed in tumor cells and has been implicated in several tumourigenic processes such as metastasis and telomerase activation, however, more importantly the focus of the present study is on the maintenance of cellular viability and the evasion of apoptosis. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of LRP/LR on the cellular viability of early (A375) and late stage (A375SM) malignant melanoma cells. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis revealed that A375SM cells contain more cell-surface and total LRP/LR levels in comparison to the A375 cells, respectively. In order to determine the effect of LRP/LR on cell viability and apoptosis, LRP was down-regulated via siRNA technology. MTT assays revealed that LRP knock-down led to significant reductions in the viability of A375 and A375SM cells. Confocal microscopy indicated nuclear morphological changes suggestive of apoptotic induction in both cell lines and Annexin-V FITC/PI assays confirmed this observation. Additionally, caspase-3 activity assays revealed that apoptosis was induced in both cell lines after siRNA-mediated down-regulation of LRP. Caspase-8 and −9 activity assays suggested that post LRP knock-down; A375 cells undergo apoptosis solely via the extrinsic pathway, while A375SM cells undergo apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. Implications: siRNAs mediated LRP knock-down might represent a powerful alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of malignant melanoma through the induction of apoptosis.

Abstract: Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD) is a common primary cause of defects in mitochondrial function and also can lead to peripheral neuropathy. Pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit beta (PDHB) is a subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1, which is a well-known component of PDC. In Drosophila melanogaster, the CG11876 (dPDHB) gene is a homolog of human PDHB. In this study, we established a Drosophila model with neuron-specific knockdown of dPDHB to investigate its role in neuropathy pathogenesis. Knockdown of dPDHB in pan-neurons induced locomotor defects in both larval and adult stages, which were consistent with abnormal morphology of the motor neuron terminals at neuromuscular junctions and mitochondrial fragmentation in brains. Moreover, neuron-specific knockdown of dPDHB also shortened the lifespan of adult flies. In addition, flies with knockdown of dPDHB manifested a rough eye phenotype and aberrant photoreceptor axon targeting. These results with the Drosophila model suggest the involvement of PDHB in peripheral neuropathy.

Abstract: Protocadherins (Pcdhs) are widely-expressed transmembrane proteins in the nervous system. Recent studies suggest that Pcdhs play multiple critical roles during neuronal development. However, the cellular mechanisms of Pcdh7 in neurons are still largely unknown. In the current study, we demonstrated that the expression of Pcdh7 during mouse brain development was regulated spatiotemporally. We observed that the elevated expression of Pcdh7 led to activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in primary cortical neurons. Whole transcriptome sequencing revealed that 12 genes were involved in the apoptotic pathway including baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) repeat containing 5 (BIRC5). The neuronal apoptosis caused by Pcdh7 overexpression could be significantly inhibited by either a missense mutation in the conserved motif CM2 domain of Pcdh7 or BIRC5 overexpression. These results suggest the existence of Pcdh7-BIRC5 signaling cascade in the cortical neurons and represent a potential therapeutic area for further investigation.

Abstract: Adult skeletal muscle regeneration relies on the activity of satellite cells residing in the skeletal muscle niche. However, systemic and intrinsic factors decrease the myogenic differentiation potential of satellite cells thereby impairing muscle regeneration. Here we present data showing that late passage C2C12 myoblasts exhibited significantly impaired myogenic differentiation potential that was accompanied by impaired expression of myogenic regulatory factors (Myf5, MyoD, Myogenin, and MRF4) and members of myocyte enhancer factor 2 family. Notably, ectopic expression of NANOG preserved the morphology and restored the myogenic differentiation capacity of late passage myoblasts, possibly by restoring the expression level of these myogenic factors. Muscle regeneration was effective in 2D cultures and in 3D skeletal microtissues mimicking the skeletal muscle niche. The presence of NANOG was required for at least 15days to reverse the impaired differentiation potential of myoblasts. However, it was critical to remove NANOG during the process of maturation, as it inhibited myotube formation. Finally, myoblasts that were primed by NANOG maintained their differentiation capacity for 20days after NANOG withdrawal, suggesting potential epigenetic changes. In conclusion, these results shed light on the potential of NANOG to restore the myogenic differentiation potential of myoblasts, which is impaired after multiple rounds of cellular division, and to reverse the loss of muscle regeneration.

Abstract: Plant response to water stress involves the activation of mechanisms expected to help them cope with water scarcity. Among these mechanisms, proteome-wide adjustment is well known. This includes actions to save energy, protect cellular and molecular components, and maintain vital functions of the cell. Intrinsically disordered proteins, which are proteins without a rigid three-dimensional structure, are seen as emerging multifunctional cellular components of proteomes. They are highly abundant in eukaryotic proteomes, and numerous functions for these proteins have been proposed. Here, we discuss several reasons why the collection of intrinsically disordered proteins in a proteome (disordome) could be subjected to an active regulation during conditions of water scarcity in plants. We also discuss the potential misinterpretations of disordome content estimations made so far due to bias-prone data and the need for reliable analysis based on experimental data in order to acknowledge the plasticity nature of the disordome.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cause of cancer-related death in both female and male patients, with a high capacity for tumor migration and invasion. Recently, aberrant nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1 (NUSAP1) expression has been reported in several cancers. However, the biological function and molecular mechanism of NUSAP1 in CRC have not been reported. Here, we demonstrated that NUSAP1 gene expression was notably upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines (Caco2, LS174T, SW480, and LoVo). Subsequently, SW480 and LoVo cells were transfected with NUSAP1 siRNA, respectively, and the biological function of NUSAP1 was investigated. Results indicated that NUSAP1 silencing by siRNA inhibited CRC cell proliferation, and induces cell apoptosis. Moreover, NUSAP1 knockdown suppressed cell migration, cell invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, NUSAP1 silencing notably inhibited the mRNA and protein expression level of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). DNMT1 overexpression partly rescued the effect of NUSAP1 silencing on colorectal cancer biological function. Taken together, NUSAP1 gene silencing induced cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation, cell migration, cell invasion, and EMT in colorectal cancer through inhibiting DNMT1 gene expression. These findings indicat that NUSAP1 is a promising molecular target for CRC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal mandibular hypoplasia (SMH), one of the common types of craniofacial deformities, seriously affects appearance, chewing, pronunciation, and breathing. Moreover, SMH is prone to inducing obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. We found that brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1), the core component of the molecular circadian oscillator, was significantly decreased in mandibles of juvenile SMH patients. Accordingly, SMH was observed in circadian-rhythm-disrupted or BMAL1-deficient mice. RNA sequencing and protein chip analyses suggested that matrix metallopeptidase 3 (MMP3) is the potential target of BMAL1. Interestingly, in juvenile SMH patients, we observed that MMP3 was obviously increased. Consistently, MMP3 was upregulated during the whole growth period of 3–10 weeks in Bmal1−/− mice. Given these findings, we set out to characterize the underlying mechanism and found BMAL1 deficiency enhanced Mmp3 transcription through activating p65 phosphorylation. Together, our results provide insight into the mechanism by which BMAL1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of SMH.

Abstract: Hypoxia is associated with the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma through promotion of spontaneous metastasis but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we hypothesis that tumor cell-derived HMGB1 orchestrates macrophages infiltration and promotes metastasis of HCC via enhancing macrophage-secreted IL-6 under hypoxia. HMGB1 expression was robustly exacerbated in tumors of HCC patients with PVTT. Meanwhile, hypoxia exposure gave rise to HMGB1 expression in hepatoma cells of human and mouse in a HIF-1α-dependent manner and subsequently induced the infiltration and reprogramming of macrophages to augment the expression of Il-6. Further study demonstrated macrophage-derived IL-6 enhanced the invasiveness and metastasis of murine HCC cells. Therefore, our study provides a novel understanding of the relationship between tumor cells and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in the context of hypoxia.

Abstract: Tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) includes hyperphosphorylation and truncation of tau. Phosphorylation at S422 is found to suppress truncation of tau at D421 that leading to the generation of ΔTau. However, the interrelation between hyperphosphorylation and generation of ΔTau in AD remains elusive. In current study, staurosporine (Stau) induced ΔTau generation by caspases in SH-SY5Y cells with tau overexpression was found to be accompanied by a dramatic dephosphorylation at S422 and the epitope of the diagnostic antibody AT8 (S199 + S202 + T205), but a moderate dephosphorylation of PHF1 (S396 + S404) epitope. Therefore, to explore the effect of AT8 epitope on tau truncation, the residues in AT8 epitope were mutated to produce “pseudo-phosphorylated” (AT8E) or “pseudo-unphosphorylated” (AT8A) tau constructs. With Stau treatment, the generation of ΔTau from tau-AT8E was significantly attenuated comparing with that from tau-AT8A, which was S422-independent in that addition of S422A mutation still preserved this effect. Interestingly, this modulatory effect was able to be reversed by addition of PHF1E mutation. Moreover, treating the crude tau extracts with recombinant caspase-3 in vitro, also showed that ΔTau level was suppressed by AT8E, and potentiated by AT8E + PHF1E. The results primarily revealed the modulating effects of phosphorylation on ΔTau generation which may have potential implications in tau pathological processes and therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: The ATP/P2X7 axis of dendritic cells (DCs) mediates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and promotes secretion of interleukin (IL)−1β and IL-18 to induce T helper (Th) 2, Th17 differentiation in the pathogenesis of asthma. NLRP3 inflammasome also regulates high mobility protein 1 (HMGB1) release in DCs. Recent studies demonstrated the correlation between HMGB1 expression and airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in asthma. However, the relationship between the ATP/P2X7-NLRP3 axis and HMGB1 in DCs in asthma is still unclear. ATP, apyrase, Brilliant Blue G, BzATP, glibenclamide, and Z-YVAD-FMK were administered to ovalbumin (OVA)-induced murine asthmatic model. For in vitro studies, bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMDCs) were primed with LPS and stimulated with the same reagents. Activation of the ATP/P2X7 axis aggravated airway inflammation and AHR in the lung and induced Th2, Th17 polarization in asthmatic mice. Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome weakened cardinal features of asthma and blocked Th2, Th17 polarization. In vitro and vivo, ATP/P2X7 axis activated NLRP3 inflammasome and induced HMGB1 expression and release from DCs. Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome reduced HMGB1 expression and release. The ATP/P2X7-NLRP3 axis of DCs participates in mediating airway inflammation, AHR, and promoting Th2, Th17 inflammatory responses in asthmatic mice by inducing HMGB1 expression and secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Human stem cells represent a potential source for implants that replace the depleted functional beta cell mass (FBM) in diabetes patients. Human embryonic stem cell-derived pancreatic endoderm (hES-PE) can generate implants with glucose-responsive beta cells capable of reducing hyperglycemia in mice. This study with device-encapsulated hES-PE (4 × 106 cells/mouse) determines the biologic characteristics at which implants establish metabolic control during a 50-week follow-up. A metabolically adequate FBM was achieved by (1) formation of a sufficient beta cell number (>0.3 × 106/mouse) at >50% endocrine purity and (2) their maturation to a functional state comparable with human pancreatic beta cells, as judged by their secretory responses during perifusion, their content in typical secretory vesicles, and their nuclear NKX6.1-PDX1-MAFA co-expression. Assessment of FBM in implants and its correlation with in vivo metabolic markers will guide clinical translation of stem cell-derived grafts in diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating systemic factors can regulate adult neural stem cell (NSC) biology, but the identity of these circulating cues is still being defined. Here, we have focused on the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), since increased circulating levels of IL-6 are associated with neural pathologies such as autism and bipolar disorder. We show that IL-6 promotes proliferation of post-natal murine forebrain NSCs and that, when the IL-6 receptor is inducibly knocked out in post-natal or adult neural precursors, this causes a long-term decrease in forebrain NSCs. Moreover, a transient circulating surge of IL-6 in perinatal or adult mice causes an acute increase in neural precursor proliferation followed by long-term depletion of adult NSC pools. Thus, IL-6 signaling is both necessary and sufficient for adult NSC self-renewal, and acute perturbations in circulating IL-6, as observed in many pathological situations, have long-lasting effects on the size of adult NSC pools.

Abstract: Identifying and targeting oncogenic fusion genes have revolutionized the treatment of leukemia, such as PML-RARα fusion gene in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here we identified an intrachromosomal fusion gene located on chromosome 19q.13 between UBA2 and WTIP gene in a case of acute myeloid leukemia. The UBA2-WTIP fusion gene contains the N-terminal E1_enzyme_family, VAE_Ubl domains of UBA2, and the C-terminal LIM domains of WTIP. The UBA2-WTIP fusion was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing in 19 of 56 acute myeloid leukemia samples (33.9%). Ectopic expression of the UBA2-WTIP fusion in human acute myeloid leukemia KG-1a cells showed enhanced cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. The UBA2-WTIP fusion induced phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5 and ERK1/2, and abrogates WTIP-mediated mammalian processing body formation. Finally, triptolide displayed selective cytotoxicity against KG-1a cells harboring the UBA2-WTIP fusion. Collectively, our findings suggest that the UBA2-WTIP fusion is an oncogenic fusion gene, as well as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Plants employ cell-surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogens. Although phytohormones produced during PRR signaling play an essential role in innate immunity, a direct link between PRR activation and hormone regulation is unknown. EFR is a PRR that recognizes bacterial EF-Tu and activates immune signaling. Here we report that EFR regulates the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) through direct phosphorylation of a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, BIK1. The BIK1 structure revealed that the EFR-phosphorylated sites reside on a uniquely extended loop away from the BIK1 kinase core domain. Phosphomimetic mutations of these sites resulted in increased phytohormones and enhanced resistance to bacterial infections. In addition to its documented plasma membrane localization, BIK1 also localizes to the nucleus and interacts directly with WRKY transcription factors involved in the JA and salicylic acid (SA) regulation. These findings demonstrate the mechanistic basis of signal transduction from PRR to phytohormones, mediated through a PRR-BIK1-WRKY axis.

Abstract: Background/objective
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been recognized to be a potential pharmaceutical target for treating ischemic stroke, but its severe side effects hinder its widely application. Here, the present study was designed to investigate the effects of VEGF on blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption and the underlying mechanisms.
Methods
A mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was constructed and treated with or without VEGF. Meanwhile, mice brain microvascular endothelial cells in co-culture with astrocytes were subjected to 1, 2 and 4 h oxygen–glucose deprivation followed by 24 h of reperfusion (OGD/R) in the absence or presence of VEGF. The mRNA and protein expression were assessed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was utilized to validate LOC102640519 expression in OGD/R cell models. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to confirm the regulatory mechanism of LOC102640519 to HOXC13. Interactions between HOXC13 and ZO-1 were measured by a luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull down assay.
Results
Our results showed that administration of VEGF significantly aggravated BBB by upregulating LOC102640519 and HOXC13 expression in vitro and vitro model of cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, LOC102640519 positively regulated the expression of HOXC13, thus negatively regulated the expression of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5 in OGD/R model in the absence or presence of VEGF.
Conclusions
VEGF aggravated BBB disruption after cerebral I/R-induced injury probably by increasing LOC102640519 and HOXC13 through inhibition of ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5.

Abstract: Thermal manipulation during embryogenesis has been demonstrated to enhance the thermotolerance capacity of broilers through epigenetic modifications. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are induced in response to stress for guarding cells against damage. The present study investigates the effect of thermal conditioning during embryogenesis and thermal challenge at 42 days of age on HSP gene and protein expression, DNA methylation and in vitro luciferase assay in brain tissue of Naked Neck (NN) and Punjab Broiler-2 (PB-2) chicken. On the 15th day of incubation, fertile eggs from two breeds, NN and PB-2, were randomly divided in to two groups: control (C)—eggs were incubated under standard incubation conditions, and thermal conditioning (TC)—eggs were exposed to higher incubation temperature (40.5°C) for 3 h on the 15th, 16th, and 17th days of incubation. The chicks obtained from each group were further subdivided and reared under different environmental conditions from the 15th to the 42nd day as normal [N; 25 ± 1 °C, 70% relative humidity (RH)] and heat exposed (HE; 35 ± 1 °C, 50% RH) resulting in four treatment groups (CN, CHE, TCN, and TCHE). The results revealed that HSP promoter activity was stronger in CHE, which had lesser methylation and higher gene expression. The activity of promoter region was lesser in TCHE birds that were thermally manipulated at the embryonic stage, thus reflecting their stress-free condition. This was confirmed by the lower level of mRNA expression of all the HSP genes. In conclusion, thermal conditioning during embryogenesis has a positive impact and improves chicken thermotolerance capacity in postnatal life.

Abstract: Summary
Selenoproteins, defined by the presence of selenocysteines (Sec), play important roles in a wide range of biological processes. All known selenoproteins are marked by the presence of Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) at their mRNA. The lack of an effective analytical method has hindered our ability to explore the selenoproteome and new selenoproteins beyond SECIS. Here, we develop a Sec-specific mass spectrometry-based technique, termed “SecMS,” which allows the systematic profiling of selenoproteomes by selective alkylation of Sec. Using SecMS, we quantitatively characterized the age- and stress-regulated selenoproteomes for nine tissues from mice of different ages and mammalian cells, demonstrating tissue-specific selenoproteomes and an age-dependent decline in specific selenoproteins in brains and hearts. We established an integrated platform using SecMS and SECIS-independent selenoprotein (SIS) database and further identified five candidate selenoproteins. The application of this integrated platform provides an effective strategy to explore the selenoproteome independent of SECIS.

Abstract: Summary
Androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells (AG-haESCs) hold great promise for exploring gene functions and generating gene-edited semi-cloned (SC) mice. However, the high incidence of self-diploidization and low efficiency of SC mouse production are major obstacles preventing widespread use of these cells. Moreover, although SC mice generation could be greatly improved by knocking out the differentially methylated regions of two imprinted genes, 50% of the SC mice did not survive into adulthood. Here, we found that the genome-wide DNA methylation level in AG-haESCs is extremely low. Subsequently, downregulation of both de novo methyltransferase Dnmt3b and other methylation-related genes was determined to be responsible for DNA hypomethylation. We further demonstrated that ectopic expression of Dnmt3b in AG-haESCs could effectively improve DNA methylation level, and the high incidence of self-diploidization could be markedly rescued. More importantly, the developmental potential of SC embryos was improved, and most SC mice could survive into adulthood.

Abstract: Summary
MyoD and Myf5 are fundamental regulators of skeletal muscle lineage determination in the embryo, and their expression is induced in satellite cells following muscle injury. MyoD and Myf5 are also expressed by satellite cell precursors developmentally, although the relative contribution of historical and injury-induced expression to satellite cell function is unknown. We show that satellite cells lacking both MyoD and Myf5 (double knockout [dKO]) are maintained with aging in uninjured muscle. However, injured muscle fails to regenerate and dKO satellite cell progeny accumulate in damaged muscle but do not undergo muscle differentiation. dKO satellite cell progeny continue to express markers of myoblast identity, although their myogenic programming is labile, as demonstrated by dramatic morphological changes and increased propensity for non-myogenic differentiation. These data demonstrate an absolute requirement for either MyoD or Myf5 in muscle regeneration and indicate that their expression after injury stabilizes myogenic identity and confers the capacity for muscle differentiation.

Abstract: Mammalian male germ cell development takes place in the testis under the influence of a variety of somatic cells and an incompletely defined paracrine and endocrine influences. Since it is not recapitulated well in vitro, researchers studying spermatogenesis often manipulate the germline by creating transgenic or knockout mice or by administering pharmaceutical agonists/antagonists or inhibitors. The effects of these types of manipulations on germline development can often be determined following microscopic imaging, both of stained and immunostained testis sections. Here, we describe approaches for microscopic analysis of the developing male germline, provide detailed protocols for a variety of immunostaining approaches, and discuss transgenic fluorescent reporter lines for studying the early stages of spermatogenesis.

Abstract: Marine organisms experience abiotic stressors such as fluctuations in temperature, UV radiation, salinity, and oxygen concentration. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) assist in the response of cells to these stressors by refolding and maintaining the activity of damaged proteins. The well-conserved Hsp70 chaperone family is essential for cell viability as well as the response to stress. Organisms possess a variety of Hsp70 isoforms that differ slightly in amino acid sequence, yet very little is known about their functional relevance. In this study, we undertook analysis of three principal Hsp70 isoforms NvHsp70A, B, and D from the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. The functionality of Hsp70 isoforms in the starlet sea anemone was assessed through transcriptional analysis and by heterologous expression in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Interestingly, these isoforms were found to not only differ in expression under stress but also appear to have functional differences in their ability to mediate the cellular stress program. These results contribute to an understanding of Hsp70 isoform specificity, their shared and unique roles in response to acute and chronic environmental stress, and the potential basis of local adaptation in populations of N. vectensis.

Abstract: Physical exercise can induce various adaptation reactions in skeletal muscle tissue, such as sarcomere remodeling. The latter involves degradation of damaged sarcomere components, as well as de novo protein synthesis and sarcomere assembly. These processes are controlled by specific protease systems in parallel with molecular chaperones that assist in folding of newly synthesized polypeptide chains and their incorporation into sarcomeres. Since acute exercise induces oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to activation of the transcription factor NFκB (nuclear factor kappa B), we speculated that this transcription factor might also play a role in the regulation of long-term adaptation to regular exercise. Thus, we studied skeletal muscle adaptation to running exercise in a murine model system, with and without parallel treatment with the NFκB-inhibitory, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory drug pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). In control mice, 10 weeks of uphill (15° incline) treadmill running for 60 min thrice a week at a final speed of 14 m/min had differential, but only minor effects on many genes encoding molecular chaperones for sarcomere proteins, and/or factors involved in the degradation of the latter. Furthermore, there were marked differences between individual muscles. PDTC treatment modulated gene expression patterns as well, both in sedentary and exercising mice; however, most of these effects were also modest and there was little effect of PDTC treatment on exercise-induced changes in gene expression. Taken together, our data suggest that moderate-intensity treadmill running, with or without parallel PDTC treatment, had little effect on the expression of genes encoding sarcomere components and sarcomere-associated factors in murine skeletal muscle tissue.

Abstract: Penehyclidine hydrochloride (PHC) preconditioning can alleviate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and inhibits the upregulation of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) during I/R. To validate that VDAC1 is a bona fide target of PHC for the protection against myocardial I/R injury, VDAC1 expression construct was delivered by lentiviruses into rat left ventricular myocardium before PHC preconditioning and myocardial I/R. Overexpression of VDAC1 exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury following I/R, and abolished the cardioprotective effect of PHC during I/R injury. Moreover, VDAC1 overexpression with myocardial I/R further increased cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm, elevated the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, and decreased the level of Bcl-2 as compared with I/R alone, and PHC-mediated inhibition of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis during myocardial I/R was abolished by VDAC1 overexpression. In addition, VDAC1 was overexpressed in H9c2 cardiomyocytes undergoing anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) with or without PHC pretreatment. The in vitro results showed that overexpression of VDAC1 further reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and enhanced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in H9c2 cells after A/R, and VDAC1 overexpression abrogated the protective effect of PHC on the mitochondrial function and integrity during A/R. In conclusion, exogenous overexpression of VDAC1 during myocardial I/R inhibits the cardioprotective effects of PHC. These effects may be associated with the suppression of VDAC1 expression.

Abstract: A platform for studying spinal cord organogenesis in vivo where embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived neural progenitor cells (NPC) self-organize into spinal cord-like tissue after transplantation in subarachnoid space of the spinal cord has been described. We advance the applicability of this platform by imaging in vivo the formed graft through T2w magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to verify the stereotypical organization of the graft showing that it mimics the host spinal cord. Within the graft white matter (WM) we identified astrocytes that form glial limitans, myelinating oligodendrocytes, and myelinated axons with paranodes. Within the graft grey matter (GM) we identified cholinergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of ESC-derived complex vasculature that includes the presence of blood brain barrier. In addition to the formation of mature spinal cord tissue, we describe factors that drive this process. Specifically, we identify Flk1+ cells as necessary for spinal cord formation, and synaptic connectivity with the host spinal cord and formation of host-graft chimeric vasculature as contributing factors. This model can be used to study spinal cord organogenesis, and as an in vivo drug discovery platform for screening potential therapeutic compounds and their toxicity.

Abstract: Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) potentiates existing brain damage and increases mortality and morbidity via poorly understood mechanisms. The aim of our study is to investigate the role of Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) in the development and progression of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury with a focus on mitochondrial fission and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our data indicated that Sirt3 was downregulated in response to cerebral IRI. However, the overexpression of Sirt3 reduced the brain infarction area and repressed IRI-mediated neuron apoptosis. Functional assays demonstrated that IRI augmented mitochondrial fission, which induced ROS overproduction, redox imbalance, mitochondrial pro-apoptotic protein leakage, and caspase-9-dependent cell death pathway activation. However, the overexpression of Sirt3 blocked mitochondrial fission and induced pro-survival signals in neurons subjected to IRI. At the molecular level, our data further illustrated that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is required for the neuroprotection exerted by Sirt3 overexpression. Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation via inhibiting β-catenin phosphorylation attenuates mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial apoptosis. Collectively, our data show that cerebral IRI is associated with Sirt3 downregulation, Wnt/β-catenin pathway phosphorylated inactivation, and mitochondrial fission initiation, causing neurons to undergo caspase-9-dependent cell death. Based on this, strategies for enhancing Sirt3 activity and activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway could be therapeutic targets for treating cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Abstract: Summary
The existence of bipotential precursors for both mesenchymal and endothelial stem/progenitor cells in human postnatal life is debated. Here, we hypothesized that such progenitors are present within the human term placenta. From a heterogeneous placental single-cell suspension, a directly flow-sorted CD45−CD34+CD144+CD31Lo population uniquely differentiated into both endothelial and mesenchymal colonies in limiting dilution culture assays. Of interest, these bipotent cells were in vessel walls but not in contact with the circulation. RNA sequencing and functional analysis demonstrated that Notch signaling was a key driver for endothelial and bipotential progenitor function. In contrast, the formation of mesenchymal cells from the bipotential population was not affected by TGFβ receptor inhibition, a classical pathway for endothelial-mesenchymal transition. This study reveals a bipotent progenitor phenotype in the human placenta at the cellular and molecular levels, giving rise to endothelial and mesenchymal cells ex vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Diacylglycerol-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels play crucial roles in a wide variety of biological processes and systems, but their activation mechanism is not well understood. We describe an optical toolkit by which activation and deactivation of these ion channels can be controlled with unprecedented speed and precision through light stimuli. We show that the photoswitchable diacylglycerols PhoDAG-1 and PhoDAG-3 enable rapid photoactivation of two DAG-sensitive TRP channels, Trpc2 and TRPC6, upon stimulation with UV-A light, whereas exposure to blue light terminates channel activation. PhoDAG photoconversion can be applied in heterologous expression systems, in native cells, and even in mammalian tissue slices. Combined laser scanning-controlled photoswitching and Ca2+ imaging enables both large-scale mapping of TRP channel-mediated neuronal activation and localized mapping in small cellular compartments. Light-switchable PhoDAGs provide an important advance to explore the pathophysiological relevance of DAG-sensitive TRP channels in the maintenance of body homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited, progressive neurological disorder characterized by degenerating striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). One promising approach for treating HD is cell replacement therapy, where lost cells are replaced by MSN progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). While there has been remarkable progress in generating hPSC-derived MSNs, current production methods rely on two-dimensional culture systems that can include poorly defined components, limit scalability, and yield differing preclinical results. To facilitate clinical translation, here, we generated striatal progenitors from hPSCs within a fully defined and scalable PNIPAAm-PEG three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel. Transplantation of 3D-derived striatal progenitors into a transgenic mouse model of HD slowed disease progression, improved motor coordination, and increased survival. In addition, the transplanted cells developed an MSN-like phenotype and formed synaptic connections with host cells. Our results illustrate the potential of scalable 3D biomaterials for generating striatal progenitors for HD cell therapy.

Abstract: Angiogenesis is one of the essential hallmarks of cancer that is controlled by the balance between positive and negative regulators. FGFR1 signaling is crucial for the execution of bFGF-induced proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells (ECs) and onset of angiogenesis on tumors. The purpose of this study is to identify whether or not miR-133 regulates FGFR1 expression and accordingly hypothesize if it plays a crucial role in modulating bFGF/FGFR1 activity in ECs and blocking tumor angiogenesis through targeting FGFR1. The influences of miR-133 overexpression on bFGF stimulated endothelial cells were assessed by cell growth curve, MTT assaying, tube formation, and migration assays. Forced expression of miR-133 caused significant reductions in bFGF-induced proliferation and migratory ability of ECs. MiR-133 Expression was negatively correlated with both mRNA and protein levels of FGFR1 in the transfected ECs isolated from peripheral blood. Moreover, overexpression of miR-133 drastically reduced the rate of cell division and disturbed capillary network formation of transfected ECs. These findings suggest that miR-133 plays an important function in bFGF-induced angiogenesis processes in ECs and provides a rationale for new therapeutic approaches to suppress tumor angiogenesis and cancer.

Abstract: DN604, a carboplatin analogue with a functional dicarboxylato ligand, was deeply investigated to explore its ability to induce apoptosis as well as its antitumor mechanism of action. Both in vitro and in vivo assays indicated that DN604 could effectively inhibit cell viability of SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells and exhibited stronger antitumor activity than carboplatin and comparable activity to cisplatin. Significantly in contrast to cisplatin, DN604 resulted in negligible toxic effects in vivo with the same tumor growth inhibition effect as cisplatin. The mechanism study indicated that DN604 inhibited CK2-phosphorylated cdc25C activation to decrease p-cdc25C subcellular localization, leading to the inactivation of cdc2/Cyclin B and G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SGC-7901 cancer cells. Our research revealed for the first time that the dicarboxylato ligand containing a suitable functional moiety as the leaving group in the platinum(II) complex can effectively induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via inhibiting key checkpoint proteins.

Abstract: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common urologic tumor and the third leading cause of death among urological tumors. Recent studies demonstrate that RCC tumors are more heavily infiltrated by lymphocytes than other cancers. However, the exact roles played by CD4 + T cells in RCC proliferation remain unknown. In this study, we cocultured RCC cells with CD4 + T cells. Stable knockdown of YBX1 in RCC cells was constructed. The effects of CD4 + T cells, TGFβ1 and YBX1 on RCC cells were investigated using cell viability assays. In situ RCC nude mouse model was used to observe the tumor growth. The potential mechanisms of CD4 + T cells and YBX1 in RCC cells proliferation were explored by qRT-PCR and western blot. Expression of CD4, Foxp3 and TGFβ1 in RCC were quantified by immunohistochemical staining. The results indicated that CD4, Foxp3 and TGFβ1 were significantly up-regulated in RCC tissues. Human clinical sample and in vitro cell lines studies showed that RCC cells had better capacity than its surrounding normal kidney epithelial cells to recruit the CD4 + T cells. In vivo mouse model studies were consistent with the results by in vitro cell lines studies showing infiltrating T cells enhanced RCC cell proliferation. qRT-PCR and western blot exhibited that CD4 + T cells could enhance RCC cell proliferation via activating YBX1/HIF2α signaling pathway. Furthermore, CD4 + T cells functioned through inducing TGFβ1 expression. In a word, infiltrating CD4 + T cells promoted TGFβ1 expression in both RCC and T cells and regulated RCC cells proliferation via modulating TGFβ1/YBX1/ HIF2α signals.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterial cell wall lipids bind the conserved CD1 family of antigen-presenting molecules and activate T cells via their T cell receptors (TCRs). Sulfoglycolipids (SGLs) are uniquely synthesized by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but tools to study SGL-specific T cells in humans are lacking. We designed a novel hybrid synthesis of a naturally occurring SGL, generated CD1b tetramers loaded with natural or synthetic SGL analogs, and studied the molecular requirements for TCR binding and T cell activation. Two T cell lines derived using natural SGLs are activated by synthetic analogs independently of lipid chain length and hydroxylation, but differentially by saturation status. By contrast, two T cell lines derived using an unsaturated SGL synthetic analog were not activated by the natural antigen. Our data provide a bioequivalence hierarchy of synthetic SGL analogs and SGL-loaded CD1b tetramers. These reagents can now be applied to large-scale translational studies investigating the diagnostic potential of SGL-specific T cell responses or SGL-based vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Reactive persulfides such as cysteine persulfide and glutathione persulfide are produced by bacteria including Salmonella during sulfur metabolism. The biological significance of bacterial reactive persulfides in host-pathogen interactions still warrants investigation. We found that reactive persulfides produced by Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 regulate macrophage autophagy via metabolizing 8-nitroguanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-nitro-cGMP), an electrophilic product of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide signaling. 8-Nitro-cGMP signaling was required for efficient autophagy-mediated clearance of Salmonella from infected macrophages. In the infected cells, 8-nitro-cGMP caused cGMP adduct formation (S-guanylation) of bacterial surface proteins, which triggered recruitment of autophagy-related proteins p62 and LC3-II to the intracellular bacteria. We also found that Salmonella-produced reactive persulfides downregulated this autophagy by decreasing cellular 8-nitro-cGMP content, thereby inhibiting electrophilic signaling. These data reveal a pathogenic role of bacteria-derived reactive persulfides via suppression of anti-bacterial autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
KRAS is frequently mutated in several of the most lethal types of cancer; however, the KRAS protein has proven a challenging drug target. K-RAS4B must be localized to the plasma membrane by prenylation to activate oncogenic signaling, thus we endeavored to target the protein-membrane interface with small-molecule compounds. While all reported lead compounds have low affinity for KRAS in solution, the potency of Cmpd2 was strongly enhanced when prenylated K-RAS4B is associated with a lipid bilayer. We have elucidated a unique mechanism of action of Cmpd2, which simultaneously engages a shallow pocket on KRAS and associates with the lipid bilayer, thereby stabilizing KRAS in an orientation in which the membrane occludes its effector-binding site, reducing RAF binding and impairing activation of RAF. Furthermore, enrichment of Cmpd2 on the bilayer enhances potency by promoting interaction with KRAS. This insight reveals a novel approach to developing inhibitors of membrane-associated proteins.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that higher expression of follicular helper T cell (Tfh)-associated genes is associated with better prognosis in breast cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we compared the function of Tfh cells in non-cancer (NC) controls and in CRC patients between stages II and IV. Data showed that the level of CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cells were significantly upregulated in stage II CRC patients but was progressively reduced in stage III and stage IV patients. The frequency of PD-1+ cells in CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cells, on the other hand, was progressively increased from NC patients to CRC patients with increasing severity. Interestingly, the CD4+CXCR5+PD-1- Tfh cells, but not the CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+ Tfh cells, promoted the CD107a expression and IFN-γ expression by CD8+ T cells. This CD8+ T cell-promoting capacity was dependent on the expression of IL-21, as this capacity was significantly impaired by IL-21 neutralization. Tfh cells from CRC patients with advanced stages presented gradual reduction in the capacity to stimulate CD8+ T cells and the capacity to produce IL-21. In addition, treatment with autologous PD-L1-expressing tumor cells further suppressed the IL-21 expression by PD-1+ Tfh cells. Together, these data demonstrated that Tfh cells potently enhanced the effector functions of CD8+ T cells in an IL-21-dependent pathway; however, this role of Tfh cells was limited in CRC patients due to PD-1/PD-L1-mediated suppression.

Abstract: The present study investigates the effects of heat stress on the kidney in broilers, based on previous findings which showed that heat stress caused cardiac damage in broilers. Further, the possible renoprotective role of aspirin and the heat shock proteins HSP60 and HSP47 was also investigated. The enzyme levels of urea and uric acid, which are indicators of renal damage, and lactate dehydrogenase, an indicator of oxidative damage, were measured in chickens that were only exposed to heat stress, chickens that were pretreated with aspirin before heat stress, and chickens that were only treated with aspirin. Further, histological examination of renal tissue from the three groups was also performed. Finally, expression of HSP60 and HSP47 was also examined. In the heat stress group, the enzyme measurements were indicative of renal dysfunction and oxidative damage, and the histological findings were indicative of renal ischemia and damage. Aspirin seemed to have a protective effect against the renal damage caused by the stress, based on the enzyme measurements and histopathological findings in the aspirin-treated group. The findings also indicate that aspirin may induce HSP60 and HSP47 expression in renal cells. Finally, the expression patterns of HSP60 and HSP47 indicated that they may play a renoprotective role, as their expression was higher in the aspirin-treated groups. In conclusion, the present findings show that heat stress causes renal damage in poultry and that aspirin may play a protective role against this damage via pathways that involve HSP60 and HSP47.

Abstract: Summary
In vivo studies of human brain cellular function face challenging ethical and practical difficulties. Animal models are typically used but display distinct cellular differences. One specific example is astrocytes, recently recognized for contribution to neurological diseases and a link to the genetic risk factor apolipoprotein E (APOE). Current astrocytic in vitro models are questioned for lack of biological characterization. Here, we report human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astroglia (NES-Astro) developed under defined conditions through long-term neuroepithelial-like stem (ltNES) cells. We characterized NES-Astro and astrocytic models from primary sources, astrocytoma (CCF-STTG1), and hiPSCs through transcriptomics, proteomics, glutamate uptake, inflammatory competence, calcium signaling response, and APOE secretion. Finally, we assess modulation of astrocyte biology using APOE-annotated compounds, confirming hits of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in adult and hiPSC-derived astrocytes. Our data show large diversity among astrocytic models and emphasize a cellular context when studying astrocyte biology.

Abstract: Summary
The accurate control of early cell fate specification during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is critical for acquiring pure therapeutic cell populations of interest. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is a key mesoderm inducer from ESCs. However, the molecular mechanism of the mesodermal cell fate decision induced by BMP4 remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate the requirement of a bioactive lipid, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), for the mesoderm specification from hESCs by BMP4 induction. We show that BMP4 directly regulates the expression of the key enzyme for PGE2 synthesis, COX-1, and promotes PGE2 production. More importantly, in the absence of BMP4, forced COX-1 expression or PGE2 treatment is sufficient to initiate mesoderm specification of hESCs by activation of EP2-PKA signaling and modulation of nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Together, our findings provide insights into the critical role of BMP regulation of PGE2 synthesis and its downstream signaling in initiating mesoderm commitment of hESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Endothelial cells (ECs) are involved in a variety of cellular responses. As multifunctional components of vascular structures, endothelial (progenitor) cells have been utilized in cellular therapies and are required as an important cellular component of engineered tissue constructs and in vitro disease models. Although primary ECs from different sources are readily isolated and expanded, cell quantity and quality in terms of functionality and karyotype stability is limited. ECs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent an alternative and potentially superior cell source, but traditional culture approaches and 2D differentiation protocols hardly allow for production of large cell numbers. Aiming at the production of ECs, we have developed a robust approach for efficient endothelial differentiation of hiPSCs in scalable suspension culture. The established protocol results in relevant numbers of ECs for regenerative approaches and industrial applications that show in vitro proliferation capacity and a high degree of chromosomal stability.

Abstract: Tumor cells often encounter hypoglycemic microenvironment due to rapid cell expansion. It remains elusive how tumors reprogram the genome to survive the metabolic stress. The tumor suppressor TIP60 functions as the catalytic subunit of the human NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) multi-subunit complex and is involved in many different cellular processes including DNA damage response, cell growth and apoptosis. Attenuation of TIP60 expression has been detected in various tumor types. The function of TIP60 in tumor development has not been fully understood. Here we found that suppressing TIP60 inhibited p53 K120 acetylation and thus rescued apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation in hepatocellular cancer cells. Excitingly, Lys-104 (K104), a previously identified lysine acetylation site of TIP60 with unknown function, was observed to be indispensable for inducing p53-mediated apoptosis under low glucose condition. Mutation of Lys-104 to Arg (K104R) impeded the binding of TIP60 to human NuA4 complex, suppressed the acetyltransferase activity of TIP60, and inhibited the expression of pro-apoptotic genes including NOXA and PUMA upon glucose starvation. These findings demonstrate the critical regulation of TIP60/p53 pathway in apoptosis upon metabolic stress and provide a novel insight into the down-regulation of TIP60 in tumor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mutagenesis reporters are critical for quantifying genome stability. However, current methods rely on cell survival/death to report mutation, which takes weeks and prevents evaluation of acute or time-dependent changes. Existing methods also have other limitations, such as cell type restrictions. Using our discovery that mCherryFP fluorescence depends on residue Trp98, we replaced this codon with a stop codon to generate a mutation biosensor (termed CherryOFF), with a green fluorescence protein (GFP) as an internal control. We found that the red fluorescence of this biosensor is activated by a specific A/T-G/C nucleotide transition. Compared with the established hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase assay, our reporter has similar or better ability to detect changes of mutation frequency induced by physical/chemical mutagens or manipulation of mutation-related genes. Furthermore, CherryOFF-GFP can report mutagenesis independently of cell-death events, can be adapted to many cell types, and can generate readouts within 1 day for the measurement of acute or time-dependent events.
