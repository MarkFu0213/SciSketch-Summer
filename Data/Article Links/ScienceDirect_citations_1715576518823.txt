Abstract: Background
Gaucher disease (GD) is the most common autosomal recessive lipid storage disease. In this study, the changes in TFH cells and IL-4 and IL-21 cytokines in blood samples of GD patients, carriers and healthy volunteers were investigated.
Methods
Two pretreatment type 1 GD patients, 20 currently treated type 1 GD patients, 6 carriers, and 27 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. TFH cell (CD45RA−CD4+CXCR5+) number, phenotype (PD1, ICOS expression), and cytokine production (IL-21, IL-4) were assessed via flow cytometric assays.
Results
No significant differences were found between the groups with respect to the number, frequency and PD1 or ICOS expression of TFH cells between healthy controls, patients and carriers. However, IL-4+ TFH cells were significantly reduced both in percent and number in the treated GD patients compared with healthy controls (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the IL-21+ TFH cell number was increased in treated GD patients. When TFH cells were examined based on CXCR3 expression, the frequency of the PD1+Th17-Th2-like fraction (CXCR3−) was found to be significantly increased in treated GD patients.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess TFH cells in GD patients, and to show that the production of IL-4 and IL-21 by TFH cells and their subsets may be altered in type 1 GD patients.

Abstract: The actin cytoskeleton impacts practically every function of a eukaryotic cell. Historically, the best-characterized cytoskeletal activities are in cell morphogenesis, motility, and division. The structural and dynamic properties of the actin cytoskeleton are also crucial for establishing, maintaining, and changing the organization of membrane-bound organelles and other intracellular structures. Such activities are important in nearly all animal cells and tissues, although distinct anatomical regions and physiological systems rely on different regulatory factors. Recent work indicates that the Arp2/3 complex, a broadly expressed actin nucleator, drives actin assembly during several intracellular stress response pathways. These newly described Arp2/3-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangements are coordinated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) family of actin nucleation-promoting factors. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex and WASP-family proteins are emerging as crucial players in cytoplasmic and nuclear activities including autophagy, apoptosis, chromatin dynamics, and DNA repair. Characterizations of the functions of the actin assembly machinery in such stress response mechanisms are advancing our understanding of both normal and pathogenic processes, and hold great promise for providing insights into organismal development and interventions for disease.

Abstract: Summary
Stretchable and conductive fibers are building blocks for the development of a wide range of wearable and stretchable electronics owing to their small size, light weight, omnidirectional pliability and elasticity, and outstanding integration ability. Despite a large number of reports in the past decade, there is a lack of a continuous and scalable approach to manufacturing stretchable and conductive fibers with sufficient strength, elasticity, conductivity, and durability. Here we report a high-throughput fabrication method based on continuous multimaterial thermal drawing and chemical deposition processes to produce highly stretchable and conductive fibers, which are suitable for being twisted into textile yarns, woven and knitted into textile fabrics, or braided and stitched onto textile structures. We demonstrate the assembly of these stretchable and conductive fibers into breathable, machine-washable, and wearable devices for body motion detection, electrothermal therapy, and electrocardiograph signal detection.

Abstract: Summary
As the freshwater crisis looms, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with stepped isotherms lie at the forefront of desiccant development for atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Despite numerous studies on water sorption kinetics in MOF desiccants, the kinetics of AWH sorbents are a challenge to quantify. Here, we report that the AWH kinetics of seven known MOFs and the industry-standard desiccant Syloid are limited by diffusion to the sorbent bed surface. A quantitative model that exploits isotherm shape enables simulation of sorption cycling to evaluate sorbent performance through productivity contour plots (“heatmaps”). These heatmaps reveal two key findings: steady-state oscillation around partial loading optimizes productivity, and dense ultramicroporous MOFs with a step at low relative humidity afford superior volumetric performance under practically relevant temperature swing conditions (27°C, 30% relative humidity [RH] − 60°C, 5.4% RH). Cellulose-desiccant composites of two such regeneration optimized sorbents retain the kinetics of powders, producing up to 7.3 L/kg/day of water under these conditions.

TWEAK/Fn14 signaling may function as a reactive compensatory mechanism against extracellular matrix accumulation in keloid fibroblasts,

Abstract: Overabundance of the extracellular matrix resulting from hyperproliferation of keloid fibroblasts (KFs) and dysregulation of apoptosis represents the main pathophysiology underlying keloids. TWEAK is a weak apoptosis inducer, and it plays a critical role in pathological tissue remodeling via its receptor, Fn14. However, the role of TWEAK/Fn14 signaling in the pathogenesis of keloids has not been investigated. In this study, we confirmed the overexpression levels of TWEAK and Fn14 in clinical keloid tissue specimens and primary KFs. The extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes were also evaluated between primary KFs and their normal counterparts to determine the factors leading to the formation or development of keloids. Unexpectedly, exogenous TWEAK significantly reduced the levels of collagen I and collagen III, as well as alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Additionally, TWEAK promoted MMPs expression and apoptosis activity of KFs. Furthermore, we verified that the inhibitory effect of TWEAK on KFs is through down-regulation of Polo-like kinase 5, which modulates cell differentiation and apoptosis. The TWEAK-Fn14 axis seems to be a secondary, although less effective, compensatory mechanism to increase the catabolic functions of fibroblasts in an attempt to further decrease the accumulation of collagen.

Abstract: Introduction
The therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) controls the systemic cytokine level and might improve the immune response in patients with severe Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. To date, in developing countries, no study has explored the effectiveness and risk factors in a population with severe COVID-19 exposed to the TPE.
Method
We described the risk factors associated with survival rates higher than 28 days and length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) shorter than 15 days. Severe COVID-19 cases treated with TPE were included, from August 2020 to June 2021. Survival analysis with Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to assess patient-related factors that could predict a higher survival rate and the ICU LOS.
Results
A total of 99 patients with severe COVID-19 who had received TPE were followed during their hospital stay and for 28 days after discharge. The sample was composed of men (63%) aged 56 ± 16 years. The overall survival rate at 28 days was 80%. The ICU LOS (p = 0.0165) and mechanical ventilation (MV) (p = 0.00008) were considered factors that could increase the risk of death. Patient-related factors that influenced the 28-day mortality were the smoking status (OR = 5.8; 95%CI 1.5, 22) and history of oncologic or non-malignant hematologic diseases (OR = 5.9; 95%CI 1.2, 29).
Conclusion
Patients with severe COVID-19 exposed to the TPE were associated with a 20% risk of death in a 28-day observation window, appearing to be lower than previous treatments. Active smoking, cancer and immunosuppressive conditions should be considered as relevant variables to be controlled in future trials on the TPE and COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Perpendicular synthetic antiferromagnets (p-SAFs) are of interest for the next generation of ultrafast, high-density spintronic memory and logic devices. However, to efficiently operate their magnetic order by current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs), an unfavored high external magnetic field is conventionally required to break the symmetry. Here, we report the field-free SOT switching of a p-SAF through the introduction of an interlayer with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs). We experimentally observe the existence of the DMI interlayer in our SAF sample by an azimuthal angular-dependent anomalous Hall measurement. Deterministic field-free switching is accomplished in such a sample and depicted by macrospin and micromagnetic simulations. The comparison between the uniaxial interlayer DMI and the azimuthal direction-dependent switching behavior strongly suggests its origin from the DMI interlayer. We demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed strategy with magnetic tunnel junction device structure. Our results provide a strategy for p-SAF-based high-performance SOT devices.

Abstract: Summary
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) constitutes an important transformation process in fuel cells. Here we report a polymorphic tungsten catalyst with a concerted tungsten single-atom site (W-SAC) and tungsten nitride nanoclusters (WN-NPs) for mediating the ORR processes. The catalyst is prepared via pyrolysis of phthalocyanine-typed material (WPc) with g-C3N4. Synergy of the W-SAC and WN-NP sites over the designed 2D g-C3N4 layer is responsible for the competitive ORR performance of the catalysts. Consequently, the WNPc/gC3N4-700 sample gives a half-wave potential of 0.835 V, a Tafel slope of 40.47mV dec−1, and a mass diffusion-limited current of 0.596 mA/cm2; such results are comparable with and even better than that of 20% Pt/C. Furthermore, WNPc/gC3N4-700 also outperforms 20% Pt/C in terms of stability and durability. Our work may point toward a design strategy for active, stable, non-noble-metal ORR catalysts.

Abstract: Summary
The development of sustainable and eco-processing thermosets with excellent mechanical properties and advanced functionality is important but faces great challenges. Here, we prepare all-biomass-derived thermoset polyimines containing dynamic networks of non-covalent aggregates (driven by H bonds and π-π stacking) and imine bonds. Smart molecular design leads to multifunctionality, such as tunable mechanical properties, hydroplasticity, polychromatic photoluminescence, and composite reprocessing. Effectively combining these functions provides convenient ways for designing materials with advanced applications. We demonstrate the feasibility of building a 3D anti-counterfeiting platform, allowing polymorphic data encryption and multidimensional decryption, as well as sensitive stretchable dry and self-adhesive strain sensors with appropriate conformal contact with the skin. The nitrogen-rich synergistic high-char-forming benzene rings give it an intumescent flame-retardant performance that meets the criteria for fire safety. The results provide insights into sustainable bio-based plastics with integrated functions and advanced applications.

Abstract: Summary
The commercial application of all-inorganic perovskite (CsPbX3) nanocrystals (NCs) in displays is mainly limited by low-yield and high-cost colloidal synthesis, poor stability, and unsatisfactory green emission wavelength. Here we report a simple and effective strategy that generates encapsulated CsPbX3@cyanuric acid (CA) super-particles (SPs) to overcome these obstacles. Because of the improved light conversion efficiency and suppressed reabsorption losses, these SPs exhibit excellent optical properties with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of ∼90% and PL emission located at 525 nm, satisfying the high-standard benchmark Rec. 2020. Moreover, CA can greatly protect the perovskite NCs from environmental stimuli due to the trap-free bandgap of the perovskite and increased defect formation energy. By employing perovskite SPs in the display, a wide color gamut covering 94% of Rec. 2020 can be realized. This work enriches the family of perovskite NCs for high-quality displays, which will contribute to the prosperity of perovskite in the near future.

Abstract: Summary
Conductive filler-based solid polymer electrolytes are excellent candidates for the large-scale production of solid-state lithium-ion batteries. However, the transport and conduction mechanisms of lithium ions in such solid polymer electrolyte systems remain largely unrevealed. In this work, the results of in situ conductive atomic force microscopy demonstrate that lithium ions travel mainly through the Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZO) filler in polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based SPEs. The transport routes from LLZO into the polymer matrix can be greatly altered by adding succinonitrile (SCN). Combining experiment with ab initio simulations, we find that the adsorption affinity order for lithium ions is SCN > LLZO > PEO. Diffusion barriers are calculated for various composites, showing higher barriers for migration of lithium on the surface compared with in bulk. This work provides understanding of lithium affinity, diffusion barriers, and conductive mechanisms in solid polymer electrolytes, enhancing our understanding of mechanisms to guide future designs.

Abstract: Summary
Chiral perovskites have drawn much attention due to their abundant applications in electronic, magnetic, and spintronic technologies. Herein, we report fabrication of a five-layer chiral perovskite nanowire (n = 5) and its polarity preference regulation using chiral phenylethylamine or 2- butylamine as chiral ligands. We verify that the chiroptical response of the five-layer nanowire is governed by the localized surface chiral potential related to the ligand-induced helical distortion of [PbX6]4– octahedra on the top and bottom layers. Accordingly, an optical enantiomeric pair is created by varying the ligand’s type or concentration rather than inversion of the ligand’s absolute configuration. This phenomenon cannot be achieved in perovskite nanoplates. Circularly polarized luminescence ranges from 450 nm to 580 nm, and a highest luminescence dissymmetry factor of (2.67 ± 0.5) × 10−2 is achieved. This approach unlocks high-n chiral perovskite nanostructures and provides an additional degree of freedom beyond configurational chirality in regulating polarity.

Abstract: Summary
The climbing capabilities of living creatures such as geckos, tree frogs, and inchworms provide a promising platform for exploiting biomimetic soft climbing robots, but achieving this promise remains a grand challenge in materials science and engineering. Inspired by the adhesive characteristics of gecko toes and the gait of inchworms, here, we exploit the synergetic interactions of functional material components and design a hybrid biomimetic structure as a holistic soft robot, which can climb on walls and ceilings of different textures including glass, polyimide, and aluminum. In our design, the climbing behavior of the soft robot is based on dynamic attachment/detachment of a gecko adhesive pad and the periodic body deformation of the inchworm. The demonstrated synergetic combination of two biological principles and the assembly of individual components into one holistic soft robot provides scientific insights for utilizing biomimicry for soft robotics.

Abstract: Summary
Well-defined aerosols pave the way for versatile basic and applied research. Here, we demonstrate a unique whipping instability that generates from a high-aspect-ratio microfluidic device resulting in a unique steady-state gas-focused whipping jet (WJ) without any need for electrification. This WJ device emanates a multi-monodisperse whipping spray jet with a two-dimensional (2D) profile. We demonstrate this phenomenon based on various fluidic parameters theoretically and experimentally. The 2D WJ’s unique behavior is derived using analytical fluid dynamics to explain jet diameter, whipping regime, and spreading angle. The phenomenon is further characterized experimentally by measuring the angle with respect to the flow rate, the distances between droplets, the droplet shapes, and the reproducibility of these parameters. We also explain the precise fabrication of such inexpensive devices. Lastly, we highlight these devices’ potential use as sample environments in versatile applications ranging from cryoelectron microscopy over mass spectrometry to drug formulation and structural studies at X-ray free-electron lasers.

Abstract: Summary
Multilayered structure at the macroscale is a prevailing pathway for developing high-performance energy absorbers. Nowadays, most multilayer-structure-based energy absorbers are constructed with rigid materials, but research on utilizing soft materials as energy-absorbing devices is still rare. By understanding the function of membranous sheathes in the stimuli responsiveness of fan worms (Polychaeta: Sabellastarte australiensis), in this work, we report a robust biological energy absorber made of multilayer-structured soft material. Our study reveals that structural features govern the mechanical performance and the energy-absorption capacity of this soft energy absorber. Ultimately, through kinematic analysis of fan worms, we elucidate the advantage of soft-material-based energy absorbers in stabilizing assistance compared with rigid counterparts. Our work takes a significant step toward understanding the design principle of soft-material-based energy absorbers and may shed light on flexible protective devices for soft robotics.

Abstract: Rheumatoid synovitis is infiltrated by immune cells that interact with synoviocytes, leading to the pannus formation. Inflammation or cell interaction effects are mainly evaluated with cytokine production, cell proliferation or migration. Few studies interest on cell morphology. Here, the purpose was to deepen some morphological changes of synoviocytes or immune cells under inflammatory conditions. Inflammatory cytokines, IL-17 and TNF that are largely involved in RA pathogenesis, induced a change in synoviocyte morphology, inducing a retracted cell with higher number of pseudopodia. Several morphological parameters decreased in inflammatory conditions: cell confluence, area and motility speed. The same impact on cell morphology was observed in co-culture of synoviocytes and immune cells in inflammatory/non-inflammatory conditions or with cell activation (miming the in vivo situation), affecting both cell types: synoviocytes were retracted and inversely immune cells proliferated, indicating that cell activation induced a morphological change of cells. In contrast, with RA but not control synoviocytes, cell interactions were not sufficient to affect PBMC and synoviocyte morphology. The morphological effect came only from the inflammatory environment. These findings reveal that the inflammatory environment or cell interactions induced massive changes in control synoviocytes, with cell retraction and increase of pseudopodia number, leading to better interactions with other cells. Except in the case of RA, the inflammatory environment was absolutely required for such changes.

Abstract: Summary
Smart anti-impact materials are desirable for personal protection and industrial security. However, they often suffer from poor performance control and inherent stability issues. Here, inspired by the excellent energy absorption of cartilage structure, we develop a dual-network impact-hardening gel composed of dynamic polyborosiloxane and entangled polyethylene glycol networks. By optimizing the topology and composition of the dual network, the bioinspired gel has high malleability, self-healing properties, rate dependence, and toughness. Particularly, the gel exhibits ultrahigh stability, holding its network structure and shear-stiffening behavior after exposure to air or even soaking in water. The gel exhibits an outstanding protective ability (reducing the impact force by 80.2% of control) compared with common materials including foam, plastic, rubber, wood, and steel. Moreover, the gel exhibits good versatility, which can be combined with Kevlar fabric and foam to form a flexible anti-impact composite. The cartilage-inspired dual-network gel may fuel the evolution of anti-impact devices.

The crux of the strategy is to use seafood waste, easily converted to chitosan, to chelate heavy metals in contaminated water and produce metal-doped graphene composites. Graphene composites are prepared by scalable one-step laser scribing with controllable metal ion and nitrogen sites. The catalysts enable the efficient electroreduction of carbon dioxide to carbon products with over 80% Faradaic efficiency at 100 mA cm−2 in a flow cell reactor and can also catalyze the degradation of organic micropollutants. A prospective life-cycle assessment demonstrates a lower global warming potential, compared with conventional systems, for this system being used to produce formic acid and olefins in the future. Our sustainable upcycling strategy is expected to inspire practical techniques for producing green chemicals and clean water.

Abstract: Summary
Formamidinium lead iodide-based solar cells show promising device reliability. The grain imperfection can be further suppressed by developing powder methodology. The water uptake capability is critical for the stability of α-formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) thin films, and elucidating the migration of hydrogen species is challenging using routine techniques such as imaging or mass spectroscopy. Here, we decipher the proton diffusion to quantify indirect monitoring of H migration by following the N–D vibration using transmission infrared spectroscopy. The technique allows a direct assessment of the perovskite degradation associated with moisture. The inclusion of Cs in FAPbI3, reveals significant differences in proton diffusion rates, attesting to its impact. CsFAPbI3’s ability to block the active layer access by water molecules is five times higher than α-FAPbI3, which is significantly higher than methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3). Our protocol directly probes the local environment of the material to identify its intrinsic degradation mechanisms and stability, a key requirement for optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: Summary
The assessment of cell migration and proliferation is essential in the field of oncology. It has been widely performed for cancer prognosis and the prediction of treatment outcome. The microdevice-based methods have enabled the assessment of these two processes at single-cell resolution, which could acquire unique information on cell heterogeneity and subtypes. However, most of the current platforms show limited throughput due to design defects or lack of modules for high-speed data analysis, which greatly hampers the extraction of statistically unbiased biological data. To address this challenge, we propose a high-throughput system consisting of an addressable dual-nested microwell array chip (DNMA chip) and an artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis algorithm. Our DNMA chip allows single-cell trapping, label-free encoding, and long-term incubation. Combined with AI-aided data processing, the migration and proliferation of single tumor cells under normal culture or chemotherapy are quantitatively analyzed in a high-throughput and non-destructive manner.

Abstract: Summary
Visible light photoredox catalysis serves as a toolbox for the site-specific modification of peptides and biomolecules in synthetic design and chemical biology. Here, we report a visible-light-induced nickel (Ni)(II) complex-catalyzed strategy for cysteine residue arylation modification under mild conditions. This method relies on exploiting the in-situ-formed Ni(II)-cysteine (Cys) complex, which absorbs the photonic energy and transforms to initiate single-electron transfer and provide a pathway for the subsequent radical transformations. A wide range of arylated Cys-containing dipeptides or tripeptides can be obtained in moderate to excellent yields without the need for exogenous photocatalysts. Moreover, the efficient S-arylation protocols presented in this work broaden the synthetic scope of Cys bioconjugation and serve as promising routes for the selective modification of complex biomolecules.

Abstract: Histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation is generally recognized as a prominent marker of gene activation. While Set1/Mll complexes are major methyltransferases that are responsible for H3K4 methylation, the mechanism of how these complexes are recruited into the target gene promotor is still unclear. Here, starting with an affinity purification-mass spectrometry approach, we have found that Isl1, a highly tissue-specific expressed LIM/homeodomain transcription factor, is physically associated with Set1/Mll complexes. We then show that Wdr5 directly binds to Isl1. And this binding is likely mediated by the homeodomain of Isl1. Functionally, using mouse β-cell and human neuroblastoma tumor cell lines, we show that both Wdr5 binding and H3K4 methylation level at promoters of some Isl1 target genes are significantly reduced upon depletion of Isl1, suggesting Isl1 is required for efficient locus-specific H3K4 methylation. Taken together, our results establish a critical role of Set1/Mll complexes in regulating the target gene expression of Isl1.

Abstract: Summary
Sulfur-enriched Li3PS4 is a promising cathode for lithium-sulfur batteries, but there is not yet clear structural information about this material. Here, we use quantum-mechanics-based molecular dynamics to predict the structures of the fully charged Li3PS4+5 and various stages of discharge to nearly discharged Li3+9PS4+5 at 298 K. We predict that the fully charged cathode has a distorted orthorhombic structure similar to Li3PS4, but with additional S4 and S8 chains each linked to an S atom of a PS4 anion. This leads to a density of 2.19 g/cm3 for this material. For the nearly discharged cathode, we find that the lithium atoms insert into all S−S bonds, with none of the aforementioned chains remaining, leading to a density of 1.71 g/cm3. We examined the discharge process as lithium ions from the electrolyte diffuse into the cathode and react with the S−S chains to form Li2S. The predicted discharge curve agrees well with the experiment.

Abstract: Iron deficiency anemia is associated with maternal morbidity and poor pregnancy outcomes. Heme and non-heme iron transport proteins expressed in the placenta help in adequate iron supply from anemic mother to fetus. Here we examined the expression of placental iron trafficking molecules and their association with maternal and neonatal iron status in pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Pregnant women who received prenatal care at Christian Medical College, Vellore, India for childbirth were recruited. Pregnant women who were 18–35 years old with gestational age (GA) of ≥36 weeks were eligible to participate in the study. In a prospective cohort of pregnant women, 22 % were iron deficiency anemia and 42 % were iron replete. Samples were collected (Maternal blood, placental tissue, and cord blood) from pregnant women with a gestational age of ≥38 weeks at the time of delivery. The mean gestational age at the first visit and delivery was 12.8 ± 2.72 weeks and 39 ± 1.65 weeks, respectively. Hemoglobin (9.3 ± 0.9 g/dl) and ferritin (15.4(0.8–28.3) ng/ml) levels at delivery were significantly decreased in IDA as compared to controls. The fetal hemoglobin and ferritin levels were in the normal range in both groups. There was no correlation between maternal and cord blood hepcidin with fetal iron status in IDA. We further analyzed the expression of iron transport genes in the placenta of controls and the IDA group. Under maternal iron insufficiency, the expression of placental iron transporters DMT1, FPN1, and GDF15 was upregulated at the protein level. In IDA, placental GDF15 and ferroportin protein had an association with fetal iron status. These findings confirm that placental iron traffickers respond to maternal iron deficiency by increasing their expression and allowing sufficient iron to pass to the fetus.

Abstract: Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is considered one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite the undoubted therapeutic advances that have occurred in clinical practice over time, due to its high degree in both heterogeneity and resistance, NSCLC remains largely incurable. As a natural cAMP elevating agent, Forskolin has shown anti-cancer properties in different tumor types, thus supposing its possible usage in treating malignancies. In this study, we investigated the Forskolin outcome in H1299 and A549 NSCLC cell lines, either alone or in combination with Paclitaxel. We proved that Forskolin impairs cell growth and migration ability of these cells, concurrently. Albeit with a different extent between H1299 and A549, changes in cell-cycle progression and epithelial-mesenchymal markers were observed in response to Forskolin administration. Interestingly, comparable cell growth impairment was also obtained with the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX, while the employment of adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 counteracted, at least in part, the Forskolin-mediated anticancer effects. Besides as a single agent, we also demonstrated that Forskolin strongly enhances Paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity, affecting cell death mainly via apoptosis induction. Notably, H89-mediated protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition further deteriorated the combination outcome. Altogether, our data designate Forskolin as a possible anticancer molecule in NSCLC, and recognize the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP axis as one of the pathways involved in. Although achieved at preclinical stage, our findings encourage the design of future studies aimed at further exploring the Forskolin employment in NSCLC treatment.

Proteomic analysis of the mouse sperm acrosome - towards an understanding of an organelle with diverse functionality,

Abstract: The acrosome located within the mammalian sperm head is essential for successful fertilization, as it enables the sperm to penetrate the extracellular layers of the oocyte and fuse with oolemma. However, the mammalian acrosomal vesicle is no longer considered to contain only hydrolytic enzymes. Using label-free nano-scale liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) proteomics, we identified a total of 885 proteins in the acrosome isolated from spermatozoa obtained from cauda epididymis of free-living house mice Mus musculus musculus contains a total of 885 proteins. Among these, 334 proteins were significantly enriched in the acrosome thus representing 27.3% of the whole proteome of the intact sperm. Importantly, we have detected a total of nine calycins while eight of them belong to the lipocalin protein family. In mice, lipocalins are involved in multi-level chemical communication between individuals including pheromone transport and odor perception. Using an indirect immunofluorescence assay, we demonstrated that lipocalin 5 (LCN5) is expressed in the mouse germ cells, and after completing spermatogenesis, it remains localized in the sperm acrosome until the last step of the extratesticular maturation, the acrosome reaction. The presence of lipocalins in the acrosome and acrosome-reacted sperm suggests their original role as chelators of organic and potentially toxic compounds resulting from ongoing spermiogenesis. Along with this evidence, detected mitochondrial (e.g., a subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase MTCO1) and proteasomal proteins (subunits of both 20 S core proteasome [PSMA2, PSMBs] and 19 S regulatory particle [PSMDs]) in acrosomes provide further evidence that acrosomes could also function as `waste baskets` after testicular sperm maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Dehumidification not only regulates the relative humidity (RH) of buildings with reduced cooling costs but also provides a potential drinking water source for residents. Desiccant-based dehumidification has a lower energy consumption than the condensation-based method; however, the former requires successive regeneration of used sorbents and is, therefore, bulky. In this study, by mimicking transpiration in trees, we propose a humidity pump (HP) that continuously dehumidifies rooms by creating a continuous driving force for water wicking. Meanwhile, we investigate the potential of the HP by combining it with atmospheric water harvesting systems. We use activated carbon-lithium chloride composites since they have proven to possess high sorption capacity and strong capillary effect. We develop a small prototype, and our results show that it can maintain the RH between 50% and 70% while producing 1.3–3.25 g water per day. By advancing these techniques, we create an opportunity for developing more energy-efficient humidity regulation and atmospheric water harvesting systems.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical heterogeneity is usually avoided in solution chemistry, but it may still occur with sometimes dramatic effects on target materials and their properties. Here, we propose chemical heterogeneity as a counterintuitive strategy to design high-performance zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloys. We apply this approach in a Hf-Ti-Fe alloy with excess Fe in the Hf/Ti sublattice and produce Hf/Ti concentration alternations at the micro level. Such chemical heterogeneity regulates local magnetic interactions in alloy and triggers a dispersed magnetic phase transition that modulates the thermal expansions at the micro level and hence results in a remarkable ZTE behavior over a super-wide temperature window from 10 to 480 K. This mechanism is supported by comprehensive studies on morphological microstructures, crystal and magnetic structures, and theoretical calculations. The strategy of local chemical heterogeneity opens up an avenue to design ZTE and the related functional materials directly via microstructure engineering.

Abstract: Introduction
Autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation has become a standard treatment option for certain hematological malignancies. The collection of PBSCs for transplantation is a well-established process and the effectiveness can vary depending on the cell separator.  We aimed to compare the effectivity of two  devices, the Spectra Optia and the Amicus for autologous PBSC collection. We also evaluated the effect of the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count on the CD34+ collection efficiency (CE2).
Methods
We retrospectively evaluated 262 apheresis procedures performed in patients between 2015 and 2021 at the Apheresis Unit of our transplantation center. The PBSCs were collected by the Spectra Optia cell separator with continuous Mononuclear Collection (cMNC) (128 procedures) or the Amicus (MNC) (134 procedures). In addition to the apheresis parameters and product characteristics, we also evaluated the effect of the pre-apheresis peripheral WBC count on the CE2.
Results
There was no significant difference in the CD34+ CE2 between the Spectra Optia and Amicus devices (median 65.06% and 68.24%, respectively, p = 0.070). In the Amicus group, the CE2 ratio was found to be statistically significantly higher in patients with a pre-apheresis peripheral WBC count of 15 × 109/L (median 81.70%, 68.06%, 61.35% and 58.13%, respectively, p < 0.001).
Conclusion
While both devices collected autologous PBSC effectively and safely, the Amicus provided a higher rate of CE2 at low pre-apheresis WBC counts. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the CE2 in autologous PBSC collection devices based on pre-apheresis WBC counts.

Abstract: Summary
The β-carboline moiety exists in a wide range of drugs and natural products, but synthesis often relies on noble metals and stochiometric oxidants. Here, we develop a metal-free strategy using a triaryl carbenium ion pair as a catalyst to access β-carbolines from tryptamines and aromatic aldehydes. This protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, and its practicality is demonstrated with the preparation of Eudistomin U and fluorescent compounds on gram scales. Mechanistic studies reveal that the trityl radical is generated via a single-electron transfer process and subsequently trapped by an oxygen molecule. In addition, the in-situ-generated reactive oxygen-centered radical is also found to be essential for the efficient dehydroaromatization process to afford the desired products.

Abstract: Introduction and objectives
It is challenging to adopt a policy of ABO identical platelet transfusion in hemato-oncological patients because of the high demand. Moreover, there are no global standards for the management of ABO non-identical platelet transfusions due to limited evidence. The current study compared the impact of dose and storage duration of platelets on percent platelet recovery (PPR) at 1 h and 24 h between ABO identical and ABO non-identical platelet transfusions in hemato-oncological conditions. The other objectives were to assess the clinical efficacy and compare adverse reactions between the two groups.
Methods
A total of 130 random donor platelet transfusion episodes (81 ABO identical and 49 ABO non-identical) were evaluated in 60 eligible patients with different malignant, as well as non–malignant, hematological conditions. All analysis was performed using two-sided tests, and p-values <0.05 were considered significant.
Results
The PPR at 1 h and 24 h was significantly higher in ABO identical platelet transfusion. Platelet recovery and survival were not affected by the gender, dose or storage duration of platelet concentrate. Aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) disease conditions were observed to be independent risk predictors for 1-h post-transfusion refractoriness.
Conclusion
ABO identical platelets have higher platelet recovery and survival. Both ABO identical and ABO non-identical platelet transfusions have similar efficacy in controlling bleeding episodes up to World Health Organization (WHO) grade two. Assessment of other factors, such as platelet functional properties in the donor, anti-HLA and anti-HPA antibodies, may be needed to better understand the platelet efficacy of platelet transfusions.

Abstract: Summary
Aggregation and anti-aggregation are ubiquitous phenomena in nature, which can significantly affect the physical and chemical properties of the materials. However, the stability of materials in aggregates or anti-aggregates is often overlooked. Herein, a small molecule, 2,3,5,6-tetraamino-1,4-benzoquinone (TABQ) is reported as an electrode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Furthermore, we find the TABQ aggregates are air stable; however, they have poor cycle stability in SIBs. On the other hand, the anti-aggregation of TABQ triggers molecular transformation in air, whereas it boosts cycle stability and rate capability. The molecular transformation mechanism is well tracked by high-resolution mass spectroscopy. Anti-aggregation at the molecular level is vital for organic synthesis and such results are promising for deep understanding of aggregation and anti-aggregation toward efficient organic synthesis and high-performance applications.

Abstract: Summary
Functionalized cages encapsulating xenon atoms enable highly sensitive, background-free molecular imaging through a technique known as HyperCEST 129Xe MRI. Here, we introduce a class of potential biosensor cage structures based on two resorcinarene macrocycles bridged either by aliphatic carbon chains or piperazines. First-principles-based modeling predicts a high chemical shift (about 345 ppm) outside the typical experimental observation window for 129Xe encapsulated by the aliphatically bridged cage and two 129Xe resonances for the piperazine-bridged cages corresponding to single and double loading. Based on the computational predictions as well as 129Xe chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and T2 relaxation nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, we confirm Xe encapsulation in the aliphatically bridged and double encapsulation in the piperazine-bridged resorcinarene in methanol. The cages show fast Xe exchange rates (12,000–49,000 s−1), resulting in a high CEST response regardless of the relatively low binding constant (0.09–3 M−1).

Abstract: Summary
Bio-robot equipped with tactile sensors can simulate humans to sense surface characteristic information of an object, but acquiring subsurface information from materials remains challenging. Here, we introduce a smart bionic finger with subsurface tactile tomography capability. This bionic finger is equipped with an integrated tactile feedback system, which allows the bionic finger to respond to a force quantitatively. A series of thresholds corresponding to the forces are set up for the bionic finger to generate a layer-by-layer series of slice images of material. These slice images can reveal and reproduce the internal structure of the materials with a soft surface layer. This subsurface tactile tomography is further demonstrated by the reconstruction of a subsurface 3D profile of both artificial human tissue and an encapsulated flexible circuit system. This bionic finger, with the capability of subsurface tactile tomography, opens up a nonoptical way for the nondestructive testing of the human body and flexible electronics.

Abstract: Summary
A water-assisted strategy can improve the optoelectronic properties and stability of lead halide perovskites by regulating crystal growth and phase transition. However, studying the role of water in the nucleation growth kinetics of perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) is still a significant challenge. Here, water-induced nucleation growth kinetics enhancement of CsPbBr3 PNCs is revealed by multiple in situ cryogenic measurements. Water could lower the nucleation and growth barrier of PNCs to greatly increase their nucleation growth rate. Kinetically fast nucleation and growth processes result in the formation of large nanoplatelets for PNCs synthesized by adding a certain volume of water. PNCs synthesized with water added exhibit excellent photoluminescence performance in comparison to PNCs without water due to nucleation growth kinetics enhancement. This work provides a rich insight into the nucleation growth kinetics mechanism of PNCs, which paves the way for synthesizing high-quality PNCs and designing ligand engineering strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Polyhedra have long appeared throughout art and design for their aesthetic topological features and, more recently, have found versatile roles in supramolecular chemistry and organized materials. Non-regular convex tetrahedra with positive augmentations of a regular tetrahedron, for example an isohedral triakis tetrahedron, have rarely been explored in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report the synthesis of a giant triakis tetrahedron through multi-component self-assembly from four umbrella-shaped hexa-armed organic terpyridine ligands and six pre-organized cadmium-containing building blocks. Hexafunctionalized tribenzotriquinacene cavitands serve as the scaffold for the formation of the triakis tetrahedron. The convex vertices derived from rhomboid panels form four trigonal-pyramidal cages based on regular tetrahedral faces. Characterization with multiple types of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, atomic resolution microscopy, and X-ray scattering provide crucial structural information on the triakis tetrahedron. The triakis tetrahedron is applied in the photo-driven degradation of a sulfur mustard mimic. The principles developed herein enhance the possible topological diversity of supramolecular coordination polyhedra.

Abstract: Summary
The proximity between a promoter and an active site can be crucial in influencing heterogeneous catalysis, but it is unclear if there is an optimal scale for proximity. Herein, we investigate the intimacy effect between a promoter (Mn) and a metal catalyst (Co) in the syngas-to-heavy hydrocarbons reaction. Building on the base structure of a yolk-shell catalyst, three catalysts with different intimacies—atom doping, contacted nanoparticles, and separated nanoparticles—are adjusted by changing the relative position of Mn. The contacted nanoparticles are the optimal system (Co-Mn@SiO2), facilitating rapid electron transfer to active sites and promoting the formation of heavy hydrocarbons (C5+). In contrast, the atomic doping strategy reduces the Co reduction degree and leads to strong CO adsorption that hampers the reaction. The Co-Mn@SiO2 with optimized Mn content shows excellent C5+ selectivity (95.5%) with limited methane selectivity (2.2%). The C5+ productivity reaches rates of 1.8 gC5+ gcat−1 h−1, which is in line with the best reported catalytic systems.

Abstract: Redundancies in plant cell division contribute to the maintenance of proper division plane orientation. Here we highlight three types of redundancy: 1) Temporal redundancy, or correction of earlier defects that results in proper final positioning, 2) Genetic redundancy, or functional compensation by homologous genes, and 3) Synthetic redundancy, or redundancy within or between pathways that contribute to proper division plane orientation. Understanding the types of redundant mechanisms involved provides insight into current models of division plane orientation and opens up new avenues for exploration.

Abstract: Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is an immunodeficiency caused by defects in the adhesion of leukocytes (especially neutrophils) to the blood vessel wall. As a result, patients with LAD suffer from severe bacterial infections and impaired wound healing, accompanied by neutrophilia. In LAD-I, characterized directly after birth by delayed separation of the umbilical cord, mutations are found in ITGB2, the gene that encodes the β subunit (CD18) of the β2 integrins. In the rare LAD-II disease, the fucosylation of selectin ligands is disturbed, caused by mutations in SLC35C1, the gene that encodes a GDP-fucose transporter of the Golgi system. LAD-II patients lack the H and Lewis Lea and Leb blood group antigens. Finally, in LAD-III, the conformational activation of the hematopoietically expressed β integrins is disturbed, leading to leukocyte and platelet dysfunction. This last syndrome is caused by mutations in FERMT3, encoding the kindlin-3 protein in all blood cells, involved in the regulation of β integrin conformation. This article contains an update of the mutations that we consider to be relevant for the various forms of LAD.

Abstract: Microenvironment biophysical factors such as matrix stiffness can noticeably affect the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In this mechanobiology transduction process, mitochondria are shown to be an active participant. The present study aims to systematically elucidate the phenotypic and functional changes of mitochondria during the stiffness-mediated osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, the effect of mitochondria transfer on the osteogenesis of impaired MSCs caused by stiffness was investigated. Human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) were used as model cells in the current study. Low stiffness restrained the cell spreading and significantly inhibited the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. Mitochondria of PDLSCs cultured on low stiffness exhibited shorter length, rounded shape, fusion/fission imbalance, ROS and mitophagy level increase, and ATP production reduction. The inhibited mitochondria function and osteogenic differentiation capacity were recovered to near-normal levels after transferring the mitochondria of PDLSCs cultured on the high stiffness. This study indicated that low matrix stiffness altered the mitochondrial morphology and induced systematical mitochondrial dysfunction during the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Mitochondria transfer was proved to be a feasible technique for maintaining MSCs function in vitro by reversing the osteogenesis ability.

Abstract: Objective
Prolong platelet survival and functionality up to 28 days.
Methods
A sample of apheresis platelets was evaluated, distributed in 3 groups according to the cryopreservative solution used: DMSO5%+2%albumin; DMSO5%+NaCl0,9% and DMSO5%+Dextrose2%. They were then frozen at -80 °C and thawed at 7, 14 and 28 days. The in vitro survival and viability were assessed by the post-thaw platelet count and the CD41, CD61 and CD42a staining percentages by flow cytometry. The functionality was determined with the percentage of post-stimulation aggregation with 1Nm-thrombin using the Chromo-Log490 aggregometer. The control group (CG) consisted of fresh platelets under constant agitation at 22 °C.
Results
A total of 72 platelet aliquots was analyzed. The CG presented a platelet-count of 1934 ± 0.5 × 109/L and a 100% viability. The percentages of CD41, CD61 and CD42a labeling were 99, 98.5 and 96.5%, respectively. The percentage of aggregation was 99%. On day 7 of the post-freezing, the platelet count for groups 1, 2 and 3 was 1,844 ± 102, 1,856 ± 76 and 1,752 ± 226, with the viability of 98, 96 and 95%, respectively. On day 14, the counts were 1,722 ± 238, 1,649 ± 215 and 1,578 ± 223 with the viability of 96, 95 and 94% and, on day 28, they were 1,602 ± 374, 1,438.6 ± 429 and 1,406.6 ± 436, with the viability of 96, 94 and 93%, respectively. Group1 presented a higher expression of membrane antigens. Aggregation percentages were 90, 98 and 89% at day 7, 88%, 98 and 87% at day 14 and 84%, 95 and 82% at day of the 28 post-freezing, respectively, with group2 presenting the best results.
Conclusion
The results support cryopreservation as a reasonable method to prolong platelet survival up to 28 days, maintaining its functionality and viability greater than 50%.

Abstract: Summary
Carbonyl groups in organic phosphors can significantly benefit the process of intersystem crossing (ISC) but may lead to rapid photodegradation. Recently, twisted molecules consisting of an aromatic donor and acceptor free of carbonyls have been used to enhance ISC without unstable photochemistry. The strategy is thought to be analogous to the El-Sayed rule, where electrons go through circular motions and thus boost spin-orbit coupling (SOC) during photoexcitation. However, such a design has not been systematically explored. Here, by progressively twisting the two benzene planes of a series of carbonyl-free biphenyl compounds to various degrees from methyl substitution, we show that, both experimentally and theoretically, this “El-Sayed rule analogy” is different from the well-established El-Sayed rule: the SOC is more effective between higher-lying excited states and can be efficient for ISC from singlet to triplet excited states, which leads to an “ultralong” phosphorescent state due to ineffective ISC from triplet to ground states.

Abstract: Summary
The liquid robot, an advanced form of the soft robot, can freely transform between different morphologies. From the perspective of materials science, difficulty fabricating liquid functional materials hinders the development of liquid robots. Here, we report a paramagnetic-fluid-constructed liquid microrobot (1–1,000 μm) based on paramagnetic microdroplets. The paramagnetism not only allows the scaling down of the liquid robot to microscales but also renders the microrobots reversible between paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition upon magnetic field application. Furthermore, the paramagnetism equips these microrobots with on-board imaging and sensing abilities. The combined T1-T2 imaging modes cross-validated the real-time motion of the microrobots. The deformation degrees of these microrobots, which vary based on the structure of their surroundings, is measured by an ultra-low-field atomic magnetometer. The fabrication and characterization of these multifunctional paramagnetic liquid microrobots will lay the basis for their in vivo biomedical applications.

Abstract: Summary
The hybridization of a molecular excitation with an oscillating electromagnetic field has been performed in a confined structure, typically a Fabry-Perot cavity. The operation of light-matter interactions in free space has been a challenging task. Here, we report the strong coupling of electronic transitions in quadruply bonded Mo2 complexes with visible light in cavity-free solution under ambient conditions, evolving the true zero-dimensional exciton-polaritons. The formation of molecular exciton-polaritons is demonstrated by the Rabi doublets of the δ→δ∗ and metal-to-ligand charge transfer excitations in steady-state and time-resolved absorption spectra and by the Mollow triplet in photoluminescence spectra. Ultra-strong coupling is readily achieved in this molecule-light hybrid system, resulting in the dimensionless coupling constants g/ω0 reaching values up to 0.14. This work shows that the integrated Mo2 unit, acting as an atomic resonator, drives the coherent light-molecule coupling, opening a new avenue for the study of light-matter interactions.

Abstract: Introduction
Infection is a serious complication among patients with hematologic malignancies (HMs) and in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. In most centers, the management of these complications is provided by the hematologist in person, thus demanding a knowledge of basic aspects of infection.
Methods
To evaluate the knowledge of the hematologist on infections, we invited clinicians to answer two questionnaires with 20 multiple-choice questions covering epidemiology, prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of infection in patients with HMs and HCT.
Results
We obtained 289 answers: 223 in survey 1 (febrile neutropenia) and 66 in survey 2 (infection in HCT). The median score was 5.0 in both surveys (range 0.5 - 9.0). In survey 1, the questions with the lowest number of correct answers were Q3 (8%), concerning the cefepime dose, and Q1 (9%), which asked about the epidemiologic link between the use of high dose cytarabine and viridans streptococcal bacteremia. In survey 2, two questions about cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection had the lowest percentage of correct answers (Q4, 12% and Q11, 18%). Clinicians attending to HCT recipients had higher scores, compared to clinicians attending to patients with HM only (median score of 5.0 and 4.5, p = 0.03, in survey 1 and 6.0 and 4.5, p = 0.001, in survey 2). In both surveys staff clinicians, residents and professors had similar scores.
Conclusion
This is the first study in Brazil assessing the knowledge of hematologists on infectious complications. The low median score overall indicates an urgent need for continuous education. Such initiatives will eventually result in better patient care.

Abstract: Summary
Carcerands, special molecular constructs with enclosed interiors as a new phase of matter, have attracted immense interest because of their unique structures, physicochemical properties, and potential applications in many aspects, e.g., targeted drug delivery. However, carcerands for imprisoning, inter alia, anions of interest represent an unmet challenge. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a superphane-based carcerand 1, featuring up to 18 anion binding sites and a fully enclosed interior space. Carcerand 1 is found capable of incarcerating H2PO4− anion, yielding an anion carceplex 5, as inferred from crystallographic analysis, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY), as well as molecular dynamics simulations. More importantly, highly toxic arsenate anion was also imprisoned within carcerand 1, offering the arsenate carceplex 6 that proved nontoxic compared with free arsenate or peripherally bound arsenate in the HEK293T cell line.

Abstract: Summary
Multicellular organisms contain diverse tissues built from multiple cell types. It remains unclear how large numbers of interacting cells can precisely coordinate their gene expression during tissue self-organization. We develop a generalized model of multicellular gene expression that includes intracellular and intercellular gene interactions in tissue-like collectives. Motivated by modern transcriptomics, we represent multistable cellular phenotypes by mapping the binarized transcriptional patterns of individual cells onto Hopfield networks. We incorporate spatial cell-cell signaling by coupling transcriptional states of adjacent cells on a square lattice. We show that tuning the intercellular signaling strength results in a cascade of transitions toward different collective states with emergent single-cell phenotypes. Despite an enormous number of possible tissue states, we find that intercellular signaling tends to stabilize a small number of compositionally and spatially simple tissue types. These results establish a theoretical framework to investigate how cell collectives self-organize into distinct stable patterns.

Abstract: Summary
Discharge-assisted laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (D-LIBS) represents a highly promising technique in trace detection. However, it consumes large amounts of energy causing severe environmental pollution. Herein, we demonstrate a modulation approach based on ion dynamics to reduce energy costs and environmental hazards. This modulation traps and confines numerous charged particles in an effective discharge space. It then maintains the charged particle electric-drift dynamics in the millisecond timescale, largely facilitating electric energy coupling to laser plasma and prolonging plasma lifetime. Compared with conventional D-LIBS, both the electric energy and limit-of-detection are reduced by one order of magnitude, while maintaining over two orders of magnitude signal enhancement. Combined with optimized wavelet transform de-noising, the sensitivity is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than recently reported levels for typical elements. Examining electric characteristics, plasma dynamics, and signal stability further verifies the modulation validity. These low-harm, low-power, and high-sensitivity advantages pave the way for high-efficiency applications of D-LIBS in rapid and real-time analysis.

Abstract: The insulin receptor (IR) is a 320 kDa membrane receptor tyrosine kinase mediating the pleiotropic actions of insulin, leading to phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates including serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1), and IR autophosphorylation. Structural details of the IR have been recently revealed. A high-binding insulin site, L1 (Kd =2 nM), consists of two distant domains in the primary sequence of the IR. Our design simplified the L1 binding site and transformed it into a soluble insulin binder (sIB). The sIB, a 17 kDa protein, binds insulin with 38 nM affinity. The sIB competes with IR for insulin and reduces by more than 50% phosphorylation of AKT1 in HEK 293 T cells, with similar effects on IR autophosphorylation. The sIB represents a new tool for research of insulin binding and signaling properties.

Abstract: Summary
Direct conversion of methane into fuels and chemicals remains a major challenge in modern science. Formic acid is one of the most promising platform molecules. Photocatalysis proposes an attractive route for methane partial oxidation under mild conditions. The radical mechanism of methane photocatalytic oxidation restricts the selectivity to target products. In this article, we propose a strategy to break conventional limitations of methane photocatalytic oxidation by adding a thermocatalyst and conducting the process in a one-pot reactor. In this strategy, the methane selective conversion into formic acid proceeds first over cesium salt of phosphotungstic acid on titania, which photocatalytically oxidizes methane into a mixture of C1 oxygenates. These oxygenates are then selectively converted into formic acid over a heterogeneous alumina-supported ruthenium catalyst. All reactions occur at room temperature in the same reactor. A selectivity to formic acid of 85% and a productivity of 5 mmol g−1photocatalyst are achieved.

Abstract: Summary
Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (RAZBs) are a promising prospect among next-generation batteries because of their low cost and high safety, but they still suffer from severe electrochemical irreversibility. Herein, we report an ultra-stable RAZB enabled by reversible Zn2+/Na+ co-intercalation chemistry in the vanadium cathode. The additional de-/intercalation of Na+ besides Zn2+ alleviates the collapse of the vanadium-based cathode during cycling and significantly boosts the kinetics and stability of the full battery. We also find that this co-intercalation chemistry is applicable to a wide range of vanadium materials, all of which exhibit significantly enhanced cycle life and rate performance. In particular, the Zn0.3Na0.43V2O5 cathode that is combined with this co-intercalation mechanism retains over 90% of its capacity after 4,000 cycles with a discharge capacity of 209 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1. The proposed Zn2+/Na+ co-intercalation chemistry provides the grounds for RAZB to reach the next stage in electrochemical performance.

Abstract: Summary
Sub-micrometer-thick ion-conducting polymer (ionomer) layers often suffer from poor ionic conductivity at the substrate/catalyst interface. The weak proton conductivity makes the electrochemical reaction at the cathode of proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells sluggish. To address this, here we report on a class of polystyrene-based ionomers having sub-nanometer-sized, sulfonated macrocyclic calix[4]arene-based pendants (PS-calix). In films with thickness comparable to that of ionomer-based binder layers, the conductivity of PS-calix film (∼41 mS/cm) is ∼13 times higher than that of the current state-of-the-art ionomer, Nafion. We observe a similar improvement in proton conductivity when PS-calix interfaces with Pt nanoparticles, demonstrating the potential of PS-calix in catalyst ink. Leveraging a favorable interfacial chemical composition, PS-calix enhances proton conduction at the film-substrate interface, a shortcoming of Nafion. Moreover, the water in PS-calix films diffuses faster than bulk water and the water confined in Nafion films, suggesting an important role played by sub-nanometer-sized calix[4]arene cavities in creating unique water/ion transport pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Developing photochromic materials and acquiring fundamental knowledge of their underlying photophysics is significant in diverse fields, including optoelectronics, sensing, catalysis, data storage, and more. Herein, we demonstrate how the photochromism of coordination polymers can be realized by creating lanthanide contraction, whose role in directing photophysics has previously remained elusive. Integrating different lanthanide cations and a π-electron conjugated terpyridine-based ligand (tpbz–) affords nine isomorphous one-dimensional lanthanide coordination polymers of the formula Ln(tpbz)3 (where the lanthanide [Ln] ranges from europium to lutetium). The decreasing ionic radii of the Ln centers across the 4f block result in increasingly condensed packing of the metal-ligand assembly. This trend affords a spectrally selective photochromic response in the lutetium polymer Lu(tpbz)3, contrasting sharply with the nonphotochromic earlier analogs. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the chromism can be attributed to the progressively enhanced intermolecular charge transfer of adjacent tpbz– moieties induced by either Ln contraction or external pressure.

Abstract: Summary
The sensitivity of therapeutic antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral “escape” mutations has inspired efforts to develop treatment strategies that are still effective in the face of rapidly mutating viral surface proteins. Here, we demonstrate a chemical strategy that enforces viral opsonization by natural serum antibodies. This strategy uses chimeric molecules that we call covalent viral opsonizers, which covalently label viral surface proteins, with synthetic antibody-binding ligands. As a proof of concept, we develop covalent viral opsonizers that covalently label the spike protein on SARS-CoV-2 using a “mutation-proof” small-molecule-binding ligand for anti-dinitrophenyl serum antibodies. In model assays, we observe that covalent viral opsonizers can rapidly and selectively covalently label the receptor-binding domain of both native and mutant spike proteins, leading to antibody opsonization. Opsonization mediated by this strategy is able to efficiently block the key binding domain interactions, in contrast to non-covalent analogs. We also show that covalent viral opsonizers enact targeted anti-viral phagocytotic immune function. This strategy has potential general utility for the rapid deployment of anti-viral synthetic immunotherapeutics at the onset of a new pandemic to reinforce vaccination and antibody engineering efforts.

Abstract: Summary
Solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs), which are formed by the decomposition of species in the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) of the electrode surface, define the deposition behavior and cycling stability of Li metal anodes. Currently, the IHP is mainly tuned from electrolyte aspects. In this work, we report that the dominating species in the IHP could be readily controlled via surface dipoles. By self-assembling heteroatomic conjugated molecules on a Cu foil, we constructed a surface dipole that can increase the adsorption force of the Cu surface to anions, resulting in anion-rich IHP and an anion-derived SEI. The uniform nature of the self-assembled molecule layer and the robust anion-derived SEIs are conducive to uniform Li-deposited morphology, leading to a Li plating/stripping cycling Coulombic efficiency as high as 99.83%. This work sheds new light on tuning the electric double layer at the solid|liquid interface, which is of fundamental importance for the electrochemistry field.

Abstract: Summary
The α-functionalization of amines and related scaffolds plays a key role in both target synthesis and medicinal chemistry. As such, elegant solutions employing transition metal catalysis, photoredox catalysis, and electrosynthetic methods have been described. The methods often rely on harsh activation conditions or difficult-to-access catalysts and experimental setups. Here, we report a calcium-catalyzed addition of aniline derivatives into N-acyliminium ions under mild conditions to access a diverse range of Mannich-type products. The reaction is unified and can be applied to N,O-acetal derivatives to access di-substituted amides and also isoindolinones as a method to functionalize medicinally relevant scaffolds. The reaction displays a high level of functional group tolerance and provides access to a diverse range of scaffolds.

Abstract: The study of endomembrane trafficking is crucial for understanding how cells and whole organisms function. Moreover, there is a special interest in investigating endomembrane trafficking in plants, given its role in transport and accumulation of seed storage proteins and in secretion of cell wall material, arguably the two most essential commodities obtained from crops. The mechanisms of anterograde transport in the biosynthetic and endocytic pathways of plants have been thoroughly discussed in recent reviews, but, comparatively, retrograde trafficking pathways have received less attention. Retrograde trafficking is essential to recover membranes, retrieve proteins that have escaped from their intended localization, maintain homeostasis in maturing compartments, and recycle trafficking machinery for its reuse in anterograde transport reactions. Here, we review the current understanding on retrograde trafficking pathways in the endomembrane system of plants, discussing their integration with anterograde transport routes, describing conserved and plant-specific retrieval mechanisms at play, highlighting contentious issues and identifying open questions for future research.

Abstract: Lactate has long been acknowledged to be a metabolic waste product, but it has more recently been found as a fuel energy source in mammalian cells. Podocytes are an important component of the glomerular filter, and their role in maintaining the structural integrity of this structure was established. These cells rely on a constant energy supply and reservoir. The utilization of alternative energy substrates to preserve energetic homeostasis is a subject of extensive research, and lactate appears to be one such candidate. Therefore, we investigated the role of lactate as an energy substrate and characterize the lactate transport system in cultured rat podocytes during sufficient and insufficient glucose supplies. The present study, for the first time, demonstrated the presence of lactate transporters in podocytes. Moreover, we observed modified the amount of these transporters in response to limited glucose availability and after l-lactate supplementation. Simultaneously, exposure to l-lactate preserved cell survival during insufficient glucose supply. Interestingly, during glucose deprivation, lactate exposure allowed the steady flow of glycolysis and prevented glycogen reserves depletion. Summarizing, podocytes utilize lactate as an energy substrate and possess a developed system that controls lactate homeostasis, suggesting that it plays an essential role in podocyte metabolism, especially during fluctuations of energy availability.

Abstract: Silicosis is considered an irreversible chronic inflammatory disease caused by the inhalation of crystalline silica (cSiO2). The cycle of inflammation that drives silicosis and other particle-caused respiratory diseases is mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activity in macrophages resulting in the release of IL-1β. Lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) initiated by inhaled particles is the key regulatory step in leading to NLRP3 activity. In addition to its role in LMP, the lysosome is crucial to cellular cholesterol trafficking. Lysosomal cholesterol has been demonstrated to regulate LMP while cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) reduce cholesterol trafficking from lysosomes and promote endolysosomal cholesterol accumulation as seen in Niemann Pick disease. Using a bone marrow derived macrophage (BMdM) model, four CADs were examined for their potential to reduce cSiO2-induced inflammation. Here we found that FDA-approved CAD drugs imipramine, hydroxychloroquine, fluvoxamine, and fluoxetine contributed to reduced LMP and IL-1β release in cSiO2 treated BMdM. These drugs inhibited lysosomal enzymatic activity of acid sphingomyelinase, decreased lysosomal proteolytic function, and increased lysosomal pH. CADs also demonstrated a significant increase in lysosomal-associated free cholesterol. Increased lysosomal cholesterol was associated with a significant reduction in cSiO2 induced LMP and IL-1β release. In contrast, reduced lysosomal cholesterol significantly exacerbated cSiO2-induced IL-1β release and reduced the protective effect of CADs on IL-1β release following cSiO2 exposure. Taken together, these results suggest that CAD modification of lysosomal cholesterol may be used to reduce LMP and cSiO2-induced inflammation and could prove an effective therapeutic for silicosis and other particle-caused respiratory diseases.

Abstract: Live staining of actin brings valuable information in the field of mechanobiology. Gene transfer of GFP-actin has been reported to disturb cell rheological properties while gene transfer of fluorescent actin binding proteins was not. However the influence of gene transfer on cellular forces in adhered cells has never been investigated. This would provide a more complete picture of mechanical disorders induced by actin live staining for mechanobiology studies. Indeed, most of these techniques were shown to alter cell morphology. Change in cell morphology may in itself be sufficient to perturb cellular forces. Here we focus on quantifying the alterations of cellular stresses that result from baculoviral transduction of GFP-actin in MDCK cell line. We report that GFP-actin transduction increases the proportion of cells with large intracellular or surface stresses, especially in epithelia with low cell density. We show that the enhancement of the mechanical stresses is accompanied by small perturbations of cell shape, but not by a significant change in cell size. We thus conclude that this live staining method enhances the cellular forces but only brings subtle shape alterations.

Abstract: Introduction
Umbilical cord blood is an alternative source of hematopoietic progenitor cells for bone marrow transplantation; however, it is associated with a higher graft failure rate. The presence of a high rate of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) seems to be related to a greater capacity for engraftment, although is also associated with fetal distress conditions. We analyzed the correlation of the NRBC with quality parameters and its association with the utilization score of a cord blood unit.
Study design and method
Data of 3346 units collected in a public cord blood bank from May 2010 to December 2017 were analyzed, retrospectively, to identify factors associated with an increased number of nucleated red blood cells and its correlation with the engraftment capacity measured through total nucleated cells (TNCs) and CD34 positive cells. We also evaluated the utilization score of these units and identified an NRBC cutoff associated with a higher score.
Results
The median volume collected was 104 mL (42–255), the pre-processing TNC count was 144.77 × 107 (95.46–477.18), the post-processing TNC count was 119.44 × 107 (42.7–477.18), the CD34 count was 4.67 × 106 (0.31–48.01), the NRBC count was 5 (0–202) and the utilization score was 0.0228 (0.00143–0.9740). The NRBC showed a correlation with the collected volume, TNC and CD34 positive cells and a higher utilization score and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified the five NRBC/100 leukocytes cutoff that correlates better with the probability of use. No association with pathological conditions and the NRBC rate was observed.
Conclusions
The NRBC is a feasible parameter for the screening of the cord blood unit (CBU) and the minimum cutoff of five NRBC/100 leukocytes can be a strategy in conjunction with the TNC to identify better units for cord blood bank sustainability.

Abstract: Summary
Due to the intensive energy consumption and environmental unfriendliness of the current industrial anthraquinone process for producing hydrogen peroxide, it is of interest to develop a clean and efficient alternative. Herein, we report that a zinc-oxide-supported gold catalyst encapsulated by a silica overlayer efficiently catalyzes the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from carbon monoxide, oxygen, and water. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that the confinement effect of the silica overlayer may enhance hydrogen peroxide productivity by limiting the agglomeration of gold nanoparticles, inhibiting the hydrogen peroxide degradation activity, and improving the hydrophilicity of the catalyst surface. Isotope-labeling experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that both oxygen atoms in hydrogen peroxide come from molecular oxygen, and that a consecutive hydrogenation process is followed. This work poses a facile strategy to construct highly active catalysts for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, employing the confinement effects of an overlayer.

Abstract: Summary
CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) into high-value-added chemicals is an attractive strategy to mitigate global warming. However, the current CCU techniques commonly require harsh conditions, such as high temperature or pressure or complex purification, to achieve pure products. Here, we report a CCU route, which can capture and convert CO2 into liquid fuel (HCOOH) and fertilizer (NH4H2PO4) under ambient conditions. Specifically, a (NH4)2CO3 aqueous solution first captures CO2 as NH4HCO3, which is hydrogenated into HCOONH4 by a PdAu nano-alloy. The route can achieve ∼0.56 mmol/g CO2 capture capacity and ∼32.6% conversion under ambient conditions. Then, the solution is phosphorylated and distilled into HCOOH solution and NH4H2PO4 solid at 373 K. Catalyst characterizations reveal that the PdAu alloying effect and the nearby amine group on the catalyst enrich the adsorption of HCO3− and thus boost catalyst activity. This work offers a simple and useful strategy for conversion of CO2 into high-value-added chemicals.

Abstract: Summary
Tattoo electronics, flexible patches that mount directly onto the skin with the ease and flexibility of a temporary tattoo, have foreseen remarkable application potentials in personalized healthcare monitoring and human-machine interfaces. Documented tattoo electronics mostly have an on-skin form factor to date. Using dermal tattoos for in vivo diagnostics presents an unexplored paradigm. Here, we extend the application scenario of “tattoo electrodes” from an on-skin fashion to an actual under-skin configuration, enabled by a highly soft, conductive, and biocompatible polymer matrix. With printed ultrathin electrodes, we achieve a record-high conductivity and record-low skin contact impedance, allowing the design of a single-lead electrocardiogram system for seamless wearing and precise detection of intervals and rhythms in dynamic conditions. Furthermore, the biocompatible ink enables the development of dermal electrodes by virtue of tattoo artistry. It shows enormous potential for electrical communication between bioelectronics and biological tissues at a deep-tissue level.

Abstract: Summary
Radiant cooling systems offer several advantages over conventional air-cooling systems, such as better thermal comfort, quieter operation, and less air ductwork. However, their application is limited owing to high condensation risk, particularly in hot and humid climates. To reduce this risk and enhance the cooling capacity, an air-layer-integrated radiant cooling unit (AIRCU) is developed. The unit uses an infrared transparent membrane to seal a dry-air layer between the membrane and the radiant cooling surface, separating the radiant cooling surface from the air-contact surface. Here, we report a comprehensive study on the AIRCU, including (1) suitable membrane materials; (2) a method for estimating the membrane temperature; (3) the feasible range of the radiant cooling surface temperature; and (4) the cooling capacity and thermal comfort under different humidity environments. The experimental and numerical analysis results demonstrate that AIRCU is a potential alternative cooling system for hot and humid climates.

Abstract: Summary
Magnetic microrobot swarming strategies are promising methods to overcome the complex tasks that are almost impossible for a single microrobot, demonstrating stunning performances ranging from cargo delivery to medical detections. However, it is hard for microrobot swarms to navigate and perform assignments when confronted with a sophisticated environment, such as uneven surfaces. Herein, we report a strategy that organizes μm-sized magnetic microrobot swarms into mm-height cilia-like structures through oscillation and homogeneous magnetic fields. It enables more powerful capabilities of passing obstacles and achieving flexible deployment and other functionalities. Related physical analysis, simulation, and experimental results reveal that the size of microrobot swarms can be controlled by regulating the applied magnetic actuation fields. Finally, the microrobot swarms have been successfully deployed in biological tissues of 3 mm in height to greatly enhance laser ablation efficiency. The proposed method offers a solution to deploy microrobot swarms in extreme environments, advancing next-generation therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Ordered porous functional materials such as microporous metal-organic frameworks and mesoporous silica series have been widely explored from both science and engineering perspectives due to their unique physiochemical merits and broad potential applications. However, there is still a lack of ordered macroporous materials, particularly with high crystallinity that can effectively extend these ordering-based advantages to a larger scale. Through a facile co-sacrificial template sequential pyrolysis process using metal salts and colloidal crystals as precursors, here we have developed a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous framework material constructed by well-crystallized graphenic carbon and uniformly dispersed metallic nanocrystals down to subnanometer size, denoted as OMGCs. Through systematic experimental and theoretical verification by using various metal nitrate precursors, a unique atom-casting mechanism occurring on specific crystal surfaces of metallic salts is further revealed to explain its low-temperature formation mechanism at 290°C–300°C. These OMGCs may greatly expand the family of ordered porous framework materials for emerging applications.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium-nitrogen batteries can deliver high energy densities using environmentally friendly and abundant nitrogen as a resource. According to previous studies, the nitrogen conversion pathway is expected to consist of formation and decomposition of lithium nitride. However, the reaction deserves more attention prior to forming a consensus. The thermodynamic equilibrium reaction potential for lithium nitride is low, 0.44 V, versus Li/Li+, which is far from the higher operational experimental potentials. In this work, with a series of characterizations from macro- to microscale in initial and subsequent cycles, we reveal that trace water in the electrolyte would promote the nitrogen reduction reaction at a higher working potential in the discharge process. We invoke a reaction in the water-containing battery where formation of lithium amide and lithium hydroxide is key. This finding suggests a new nitrogen conversion pathway in lithium-nitrogen batteries and will provide insight for further studies on metal-nitrogen batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Chlorinated copper catalysts have shown promise for electroreduction of carbon dioxide to complex products, but the challenging control of chlorination keeps shaded the potential of chlorine as a selectivity promoter. This work develops a gas-phase chlorination strategy based on exposure to diluted hydrochloric acid at different temperatures to study the effect of chlorine content in copper (II) oxide (CuO), copper (I) oxide (Cu2O), and metallic copper (Cu) foils. Contrary to CuO and Cu, chlorination of Cu2O enhances the formation of highly reduced products (those requiring more than two electron transfers). Faradaic efficiency toward these products (0%–14% at -0.8 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) correlates with the surface chlorine content after reaction (0 to 1.8 atom % chlorine), which is maximized for mild initial chlorination degrees (Cu2O:CuCl∼1). Experimental and computational studies suggest metallic copper surfaces with moderate chlorine coverage and oxychloride-like clusters are active sites responsible for the promotional effect. These findings may facilitate structure-performance relationships, forwarding the next generation of this family of catalysts.

Abstract: Summary
Aryl cyclopropane represents an interesting class of cyclopropanes with relatively underexplored synthetic potential. Herein, we present a photoredox-catalyzed remote difunctionalization of aryl cyclopropanes, which enables facile construction of structurally diverse 1,3/1,5-dioxygenation products. Either alcohol or simply water is used as a nucleophile. This protocol demonstrates aryl radical cation-induced remote activation occurring via intramolecular electronic interaction spanning a cyclopropane-embedded π-conjugated system. By merging photoredox catalysis with copper(II)-mediated radical elaboration, a formal radical-polar crossover manifold is realized. Moreover, this reaction features mild conditions, a wide substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, and high regioselectivities. Preliminary mechanistic experiments probe the radical-involved process, indicating a concerted SN2-like ring-opening functionalization.

Abstract: Introduction
The remission induction treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has remained unchanged in the resource-limited setting in the Philippines. AML treatment consists of induction chemotherapy followed by high dose consolidation chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the Philippines, the Filipino household bears the burden of health care cost of hospitalization expenditure. Insights into the treatment costs becomes an essential requirement as these guides the allocation of resources to scheme health programs.
Method
This study involved a retrospective cohort analysis of AML patients who underwent treatment for AML. Review of the statements of account per admission per patient during treatment for remission induction, consolidation, relapsed and refractory disease and best supportive care from 2017 to 2019. Of the 251 eligible patients, 190 patients were included.
Result
The mean healthcare expenditure for remission induction chemotherapy (Phase 1) was US $2, 504.78 (Php 125,239.29). While 3 to 4 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy cost an average of US $3,222.72 (Php 162,103.20). For patients who had relapsed and refractory disease, an additional mean cost of US $3,163.32 (Php 159,115.28) and US $2, 914.72 (Php 146,610.55) were incurred, respectively. The average cost of palliative care was US $1,687.00 (Php 84,856.59).
Conclusion
The cost of chemotherapy and other therapeutics bear most of the weight of the direct healthcare cost. The cost of AML treatment represents a significant economic burden for patients and the institution. The cost increases as patients proceed through subsequent lines of treatment for induction failure. Existing subsidy for health insurance benefits could still be improved for appropriate source allocation of resources.

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules generated from precursor RNAs by the head-to-tail backsplicing of exons. Hundreds of studies demonstrated that circRNAs are ubiquitously expressed and regulate cellular events by modulating microRNA (miRNA) and RNA-binding protein (RBP) activities. A few circRNAs are also known to translate into functional polypeptides regulating cellular physiology. All these functions primarily depend on the full-length sequence of the circRNAs. CircRNA backsplice junction sequence is the key to identifying circRNAs and their full-length mature sequence. However, some multi-exonic circRNAs exist in different isoforms sharing identical backsplice junction sequences and are termed circRNA splice variants. Here, we analyzed the previously published HeLa cell RNA-seq datasets to identify circRNA splice variants using the de novo module of the CIRCexplorer2 circRNA annotation pipeline. A subset of circRNAs with splice variants was validated by the circRNA-rolling circle amplification (circRNA-RCA) method. Interestingly, several validated circRNAs were predicted to translate into proteins by the riboCIRC database. Furthermore, polyribosome fractionation followed by quantitative PCR confirmed the association of a subset of circRNAs with polyribosome supporting their protein-coding potential. Finally, bioinformatics analysis of proteins derived from splice variants of circCORO1C and circASPH suggested altered protein sequences and structures that could affect their physiological functions. Together, our study identified novel circRNA splice variants and their potential translation into protein isoforms which may regulate various physiological processes.

Abstract: Background
Drug resistance is a serious challenge in cancer treatment that can render chemotherapy a failure. Understanding the mechanisms behind drug resistance and developing novel therapeutic approaches are cardinal steps in overcoming this issue. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPR) gene-editing technology has proven to be a useful tool to study cancer drug resistance mechanisms and target the responsible genes. In this review, we evaluated original research studies that used the CRISPR tool in three areas related to drug resistance, namely screening resistance-related genes, generating modified models of resistant cells and animals, and removing resistance by genetic manipulation. We reported the targeted genes, study models, and drug groups in these studies. In addition to discussing different applications of CRISPR technology in cancer drug resistance, we analyzed drug resistance mechanisms and provided examples of CRISPR’s role in studying them. Although CRISPR is a powerful tool for examining drug resistance and sensitizing resistant cells to chemotherapy, more studies are required to overcome its disadvantages, such as off-target effects, immunotoxicity, and inefficient delivery of CRISPR/cas9 into the cells.

Abstract: Platelet extracellular vesicles (PEVs) generated upon platelet activation may play a role in inflammatory pathologies such as atherosclerosis. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a well-known contributor to atherogenesis, activates platelets and presensitizes them for activation by other agonists. We studied the effect of oxLDL on the secretion, composition, and inflammatory functions of PEVs using contemporary EV analytics. Platelets were activated by co-stimulation with thrombin (T) and collagen (C) ± oxLDL and characterized by high-resolution flow cytometry, nanoparticle tracking analysis, proximity extension assay, western blot, and electron microscopy. The effect of PEVs on macrophage differentiation and functionality was examined by analyzing macrophage surface markers, cytokine secretion, and transcriptome. OxLDL upregulated TC-induced formation of CD61+, P-selectin+ and phosphatidylserine+ PEVs. Blocking the scavenger receptor CD36 significantly suppressed the oxLDL+TC-induced PEV formation, and HDL caused a slight but detectable suppression. The inflammatory protein cargo differed between the PEVs from stimulated and unstimulated platelets. Both oxLDL+TC- and TC-induced PEVs enhanced macrophage HLA-DR and CD86 expression and decreased CD11c expression as well as secretion of several cytokines. Pathways related to cell cycle and regulation of gene expression, and immune system signaling were overrepresented in the differentially expressed genes between TC PEV -treated vs. control macrophages and oxLDL+TC PEV -treated vs. control macrophages, respectively. In conclusion, we speculate that oxLDL and activated platelets contribute to proatherogenic processes by increasing the number of PEVs that provide an adhesive and procoagulant surface, contain inflammatory mediators, and subtly finetune the macrophage gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
With increasing global climate change, integrated concepts to innovate sustainable structures that can multiaxially address CO2 mitigation are crucial. Here, we fabricate a functional wood structure with enhanced mechanical performance via a top-down approach incorporating a high-performance metal-organic framework (MOF), Calgary framework 20 (CALF-20). The functional wood with 10% (w/w) CALF-20 can capture CO2 with an overall gravimetric capacity of 0.45 mmol/g at 1 bar and 303 K that scales linearly with the MOF loading. Interestingly, the functional wood surpasses the calculated normalized adsorption capacity of CALF-20 stemming from the mesoporous wood framework, pore geometry modulation in CALF-20, and favorable CO2 uptake interactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate strong interactions between CALF-20 and the cellulose backbone and an understanding of how such interactions can favorably modulate the pore geometry and CO2 physisorption energies. Thus, our work opens an avenue for developing sustainable composites that can be utilized in CO2 capture and structural applications.

Abstract: Introduction
Colombia has been subject to intense genetic and cultural currents due to its geographical location. Hemoglobinopathies are the most common recessive diseases found worldwide and represent an important public health problem, according to the region and ancestry of each country.
Objectives
To evaluate the frequency of hemoglobin variants according to the geographical region in a population group adjusted to sex and age in Colombia.
Methods
This was a descriptive retrospective study of hemoglobin variants performed by electrophoresis in patients treated at and/or referred to specialized care institutions in Bogota, Colombia between January 2009 and December 2020.
Results
A total of 2,224 results were analyzed, 48.4% male and 51.5% female; 63.3% of patients were without alterations, 14.3% presented with thalassemia, 17.3%, HbS, 2.3%, HbS/C, 1.8%, HbC, 0.5%, HbE and 0.5% persistent HbF, with HbS being more prevalent in males (p = 0.005). When assessing the geographical regions of Colombia, a higher prevalence of HbS was found in the Pacific (p = 0.005) and Caribbean regions, while Thalassemia and HbS were more prevalent in the Andean and Orinoquia regions, and it was rare to find any hemoglobinopathies (p = 0.0001) in the Amazonian region.
Conclusions
The main hemoglobinopathies found in Colombia are HbS, predominantly in males, and Thalassemia. The distribution of hemoglobinopathies in different geographical regions of Colombia is influenced by ancestry.

Abstract: Summary
Living systems can respond to their environment through signal transduction cascades. In these cascades, original stimuli are amplified and translated into reaction or assembly events. In an effort to instill synthetic materials with biomimetic responsivity, we report an aggregation process forming a supramolecular network held together by host-guest interactions that is responsive to nucleophilic chemical signals through a chemical reaction-assembly cascade. In particular, we developed a signal-induced switch between cucurbit[8]uril binary and ternary complexes with cationic bipyridine derivatives where the charge on the bipyridine can be changed through an allylic substitution reaction with the nucleophilic signal. When applied to a multitopic bipyridine guest, the reaction with the nucleophile signals leads to supramolecular network formation where the aggregation rates and final structure depend on the nucleophilicity of the signal. This work opens the door to new opportunities for signal-responsive synthetic materials and interactions with biological systems.

Abstract: Summary
Robust ferromagnetism with high Curie temperatures (TC), especially above room temperature, in perovskite oxides is extremely rare because the oxygen-mediated antiferromagnetic superexchange generally dominates in these nearly cubic perovskite lattices. Fe4+ ions show potential to promote magnetism responses due to more apparent hybridization between Fe4+ and oxygen orbitals with Jahn-Teller distortion, while this distortion also sacrifices the stability of Fe4+-based oxides. Here, by engineering oxygen vacancies, we report robust ferromagnetism with TC above 600 K in cubic perovskite BaFeO3-δ films epitaxially grown on KTaO3 substrates. A mixture of Fe4+ and Fe3+ cations, mediated by the oxygen vacancies, was identified to be responsible for the robust magnetism as revealed by atomic-scale studies and element-selective circularly polarized X-ray absorption spectra. This study indicates that spin-state ordering could be manipulated in a simple perovskite oxide by engineering oxygen stoichiometry and would be of significance toward future technological applications.

Abstract: Summary
Controlled interlayer stacking, solvent processing, and long-afterglow luminescence have been challenges in the development of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D-COFs). We propose a twisted node modulation strategy to address these issues simultaneously. Consistency of node distortion types causes stacking style to become non-adjustable: eclipsed stacking (non-twisted node) and inclined stacking (twisted node). By alternating the introduction of twisted and non-twisted nodes into a 2D-COFs system, a reversible crystal transformation between eclipsed and inclined stacking is achieved. The inclined COFs can be easily exfoliated into nanosheets for solution processing. Confining isolated exfoliated nanosheets within the polymethyl methacrylate achieves programmable long-afterglow luminescence, which is for writing and printing, as well as imaging, anti-counterfeiting, and emergency lighting. This work provides a strategy for the design of 2D-COFs with different stackings to address the challenges of difficult processing for novel functional applications.

Abstract: Summary
DNA repair catalyzed by photolyases is accomplished by a light-dependent electron transfer event from a fully reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide to a DNA lesion site. Prokaryotic DNA photolyase, PhrB, possesses a ribolumazine cofactor and a four-iron-four-sulfur cluster in addition to the catalytic flavin, but their functional roles are poorly understood. Here, we employ time-resolved absorption spectroscopy to probe light-induced responses in both solution and single crystals of PhrB. We jointly analyze a large collection of light-induced difference spectra from the wild-type and mutant PhrB obtained under different light and redox conditions. By applying singular value decomposition to 159 time series, we dissect light-induced spectral changes and examine the dynamic interplay between three cofactors. Our findings suggest that these cofactors form an interdependent redox network to coordinate light-induced redox responses. We propose that the ribolumazine cofactor serves as a photoprotective pigment under intense light or prolonged illumination, while the iron-sulfur cluster acts as a transient electron cache to maintain balance between two otherwise independent photoreactions of the flavin and ribolumazine.

Abstract: Summary
The utilization of alkali metal anodes is hindered by an inherent instability in organic electrolytes. Sodium is of growing interest due to its high natural abundance, but the carbonate electrolytes popular in lithium systems cannot form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with a sodium electrode. Using half-cell and symmetric-cell analysis, we identify specific glyme (chain ether) electrolytes that produce thin, predominantly inorganic SEI at the sodium metal interface, and we study the effect of ethylene carbonate and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additives on the SEI formed in these systems via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Through in situ optical microscopy, we observe the onset and growth of sodium dendrites in these electrolytes. We determine that the SEI formed by glyme alone may not support extensive or extreme cycling conditions, but the addition of FEC provides a more robust SEI to facilitate numerous consistent sodium plating and stripping cycles.

Abstract: Introduction
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by chromosomal instability and increased predisposition to malignancy. The diagnosis of FA requires clinical evaluation, confirmation of chromosomal fragility and/or analysis of genetic mutations. Therefore, this study aims to identify the clinical profile of patients with FA in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil.
Method
We analyzed 100 individuals referred from the major hematology and bone marrow (BM) transplant centers in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, between the years 2018 and 2022. The diagnosis of FA was performed using the mitomycin C chromosomal fragility test, clinical data and classical and molecular cytogenetic analyses.
Results
We enrolled a total of 16 patients with FA to comprise this study. Most of these individuals (87.5%) came from the Agreste and Sertão regions of Pernambuco. We observed a slight female prevalence of FA (1.3:1). The primary clinical and laboratory findings were café au lait spots (62.5%) and bone abnormalities (53%, mainly thumb deformities [40%]). We performed BM cytogenetic analysis for eight patients – seven showed no chromosomal abnormalities and one presented the karyotype 47,XY,+21 [15].
Conclusions
Our results are important to promote public health measures for the early diagnosis of FA, as well as to foster the engagement of a multidisciplinary group in the treatment of this disease.

Abstract: Summary
Aqueous supercapacitors (SCs) are highly desirable as the next generation of energy storage devices, holding the promise of being environmentally friendly and free of safety concerns. However, their low water-splitting voltage prevents practical applications. Here, we utilize a dielectric-polymer-coated, hierarchically structured carbon electrode to prepare a dielectric-electrolyte SC (DESC), which exhibits an ultra-high and stable operating voltage of 3 V. The facile design of the polymeric superstructure, covalently bonded upon the porous carbon electrode, allows electrolyte ions to enter and interact with the electrode but effectively blocks water molecules from the entrance. In addition, the dielectric layer could store electrical energy through polarization and provide additional active sites for ion adsorption. Subsequently, the energy density of the DESC is enhanced by over 1,000% compared with the traditionally structured SC. This work may pave a new way for producing low-cost and eco-friendly aqueous SCs with enhanced energy density.

Abstract: Summary
The limited availability of iridium in the Earth’s crust poses severe challenges to establishing gigawatt-scale electrolyzers that are needed for energy storage; this problem urgently calls for reduced iridium loadings. Reducing iridium loadings requires catalyst structure optimization, but to date, little attention has been paid to the characterization of electron, proton, and mass transport in the catalyst layer, particularly at the nanoscale. We present the 3D nanoscale pore structure of iridium-based catalyst layers via synchrotron full-field transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM) and perform pore network modeling to determine effective transport properties in water electrolyzers. We observe a wide range of pore sizes in the catalyst layer, constituting pathways that facilitate mass transport. Increasing the thickness of the ionomer layer that covers the catalyst particles significantly increases protonic conductivity at the cost of reducing the open pore space and electrical conductivity, both of which are detrimental to electrolyzer performance.

Abstract: Summary
Restructuring of a heterogeneous catalyst under reaction conditions is a common phenomenon. Severe restructuring of a catalyst can result in deactivation in many catalytic systems—for example, the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Herein, we report the utilization of catalyst restructuring to improve activity and stability for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. A bimetallic platinum and zinc (Pt1Znm) catalyst protected by an in situ restructured silicalite-1 zeolite is prepared. The catalyst yields outstanding activity (initial conversion of ∼69.2%, initial selectivity of ∼91.1%) with high stability at 580°C, which is better than several commercial catalysts. Characterization shows the singly dispersed bimetallic sites of Pt1Znm serve as the catalytic sites during the reaction. Moreover, the less-stable silicalite-1 zeolite undergoes restructuring during the dehydrogenation reaction, forming a crucial protective layer on the Pt1Znm bimetallic nanocatalysts.

Abstract: Summary
Despite its potential, the optical trapping method has never been applied to supramolecular chemistry or chiral photochemistry. Here, we demonstrate that optical trapping using a focused laser beam boosts supramolecular assembly beyond the thermodynamic limitations and affords an unprecedented higher-order 2:4 complex through the otherwise-inaccessible dimerization of 1:2 complexes of γ-cyclodextrin with two 2-anthracenecarboxylic acids (ACs). This process accelerates the chiral photocyclodimerization of ACs with switched regio- and enantio-selectivities. The combined use of optical trapping and supramolecular photochirogenesis further enables the acquisition of photochemical snapshots of aggregation/disaggregation behavior and enables the fate of a mixed aggregate generated at the laser focus to be tracked during and after optical trapping. This reveals that disaggregation requires >24 h to complete and shows that dimerization of 1:2 complexes is restricted in tightly packed aggregates but promoted in relaxing aggregates after ceasing laser irradiation.

Abstract: A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) comprises a family of scaffold proteins, which decides the subcellular localisation of a combination of signalling molecules. Spoonbill (Spoon) is a putative A-kinase anchoring protein in Drosophila. We have earlier reported that Spoon suppresses ribonuclear foci formed by trinucleotide repeat expanded transcripts associated with Spinocerebellar Ataxia 8 neurodegeneration in Drosophila. However, the role of Spoonbill in cellular signalling was unexplored. In this report, we have unravelled a novel function of Spoon protein in the regulation of the apoptotic pathway. The Drosophila TNFα homolog, Eiger, induces apoptosis via activation of the JNK pathway. We have shown here that Spoonbill is a positive regulator of the Eiger-induced JNK signalling. Further genetic interaction studies show that the spoon interacts with components of the JNK pathway, TGF-β activated kinase 1 (Tak1 - JNKKK), hemipterous (hep - JNKK) and basket (bsk - JNK). Interestingly, Spoonbill alone can also induce ectopic activation of the JNK pathway in a context-specific manner. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying Spoonbill-mediated modulation of the JNK pathway, the interaction between Spoon and Drosophila JNK was assessed. basket encodes the only known JNK in Drosophila. This serine/threonine-protein kinase phosphorylates Jra/Kay, which transcriptionally regulate downstream targets like Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Mmp1), puckered (puc), and proapoptotic genes hid, reaper and grim. Interestingly, we found that Spoonbill colocalises and co-immunoprecipitates with the Basket protein in the developing photoreceptor neurons. Hence, we propose that Spoon plays a vital role in JNK-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, stress-induced JNK activation underlying Parkinson's Disease was also examined. In the Parkinson’s Drosophila model of neurodegeneration, depletion of Spoonbill leads to a partial reduction of JNK pathway activation, along with improvement in adult motor activity. These observations suggest that the putative scaffold protein Spoonbill is a functional and physical interacting partner of the Drosophila JNK protein, Basket. Spoon protein is localised on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), which may perhaps provide a suitable subcellular niche for activation of Drosophila Basket protein by its kinases which induce apoptosis.

Abstract: Fibrotic cardiac diseases are characterized by myocardial fibrosis that results in maladaptive cardiac remodeling. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the main cell type responsible for fibrosis. In response to stress or injury, intrinsic CFs develop into myofibroblasts and produce excess extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Myofibroblasts are mechanosensitive cells that can detect changes in tissue stiffness and respond accordingly. Previous studies have revealed that some mechanical stimuli control fibroblast behaviors, including ECM formation, cell migration, and other phenotypic traits. Further, metabolic alteration is reported to regulate fibrotic signaling cascades, such as the transforming growth factor-β pathway and ECM deposition. However, the relationship between metabolic changes and mechanical stress during fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition remains unclear. This review aims to elaborate on the crosstalk between mechanical stress and metabolic changes during the pathological transition of cardiac fibroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
A smart contact lens platform for ocular thermal therapy and eye protection is desirable for treating or alleviating ocular disease while reducing risk of laser injury, dehydration, and bacterial infection. Herein, we report a wearable, transparent, multifunctional contact lens platform for ocular photothermal therapy and eye protection, realized by simply spray-decorating a Ti3C2Tx MXene layer on a commercial contact lens. The obtained transparent MXene-decorated contact lens (M-contact lens) provides excellent in vitro and in vivo photothermal conversion efficiency, effectively improving the vascular blood flow in the ocular anterior segment. The M-contact lens also exhibits notable laser protection performance and superior moisturizing capability and antibacterial activity. Notably, the M-contact lens has good biosafety for eyes, ensuring its safety during practical applications. The smart M-contact lens is highly promising in adjuvant therapy for ocular superficial disease and for ocular protection from lasers, dehydration, and bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Passive radiative cooling forms a sustainable means for cooling of objects through thermal radiation. Along with progress on static cooling systems, there is an emerging need for dynamic control to enable thermoregulation. Here, we demonstrate temperature regulation of devices at ambient pressure and temperature by electrically tuning their radiative cooling power. Our concept exploits the possibility to electrochemically tune the thermal emissivity and thereby cooling power of a conducting polymer, which enabled reversible control of device temperatures of around 0.25°C at ambient conditions in a sky simulator. Besides tuneable radiative cooling by exposure to the sky, the concept could also contribute to reduced needs for indoor climate control by enabling dynamic control of thermal energy flows between indoor objects, such as between people and walls.

Abstract: Summary
Sunscreen is recommended to protect human skin from ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage and cancer development. However, small-molecule organic UV filters in sunscreens damage the environment and may pose a health risk to users through transdermal action because of their small molecular weights. Here we report a strategy for realizing safe and coral-friendly polymeric UV filters by combining the Biginelli reaction and free radical polymerization. We have obtained a water-soluble polymer with excellent UV absorbance that effectively protects mice from UV radiation-induced skin burn considerably better than well-known UV filters (e.g., oxybenzone and avobenzone) and commercial sunscreens. This polymer is non-transdermal owing to its high molecular weight and is nearly harmless to algae, corals, and mice. This work presents an initial exploration of biofriendly and coral-friendly polymeric UV filter via a simple multicomponent reaction and provides insights that can guide the design of value-added functional polymers for practical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Dehydrogenative coupling of silanes and hydroxyl compounds is a useful method for accessing compounds containing an Si–O bond. Alongside previous advances, practical and large-scale dehydrogenative coupling catalyzed by an available and cheap catalytic system remains appealing. Here, we report a general dimanganese decacarbonyl-catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of silanes and hydroxyl compounds with inexpensive phosphine oxide ligands. This dehydrogenative coupling features a broad substrate scope of hydroxyl compounds, producing the corresponding silyl ethers and silanols in moderate to high yields (>91 examples, up to 99% yield). N-silylated indoles are also successfully synthesized by direct dehydrogenative coupling of N–H bonds and silanes. This reaction can be achieved on a 40 g scale with only 2.5 mol % of the manganese catalyst, delivering the desired silyl ether in a quantitative yield without any isolation difficulties. In exploration of the mechanism, we find a probable and uncommon organometallic pathway controlled by the phosphine oxide ligand.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium-ion batteries are being used in large-scale applications, making safety management a crucial issue. Overcharged areas created by inhomogeneous reactions can potentially induce cell degradation and failure. Despite the safety concerns, few techniques permit simple monitoring of diagnostic signals. Here, we propose electrochemical profiling to diagnose reaction inhomogeneity inside electrodes. Systematic electrochemical measurements are performed using LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 and graphite electrodes from the electrode-level to the full-cell level. Complementary synchrotron-based X-ray analyses and optical imaging are conducted. The electrode-level inhomogeneous reaction is qualitatively assessed through differential capacity (dQ/dV) curves. An anomalous dQ/dV peak appears when severe reaction inhomogeneity occurs in the negative electrode, correlating to lithium plating reactions. Furthermore, industrial-scale full-cells show a lithium plating-related dQ/dV peak near 4.1 V under conditions that lead to the most severe inhomogeneous reactions. This study proposes a non-destructive, simple, and efficient electrochemical technique that predicts the fading of batteries without requiring postmortem analysis.

Abstract: Summary
Battery electric vehicle (BEV) and photovoltaic (PV) electricity adoption increases in many climate change mitigation scenarios, yet large-scale deployment of these technologies, if left unmanaged, can raise electricity costs by increasing peak evening electricity demand and causing overgeneration of electricity during midday. Here we examine these risks and how they amplify or mitigate each other. We model hourly electricity demand under BEV and PV adoption in two United States cities. We then investigate mitigation strategies that do not require travel behavior change or new technology such as vehicle-to-grid capabilities and networked chargers. In both locations, delayed home charging nearly eliminates increases in peak demand. Workplace charging can similarly reduce peak demand while also cutting the curtailment of photovoltaic electricity by half. These two approaches could be combined to suit local conditions and decarbonization plans. Importantly, capturing these benefits would require an acceleration of electric vehicle adoption relative to current rates.

Abstract: Introduction
Health research is particularly important in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where improvements must be achieved with limited resources, and where the great majority of the world's population, especially children, live. Improvements in public health detection in Brazil have resulted in cancer becoming the most prevalent cause of death by disease in the group aged 1 to 19 years, hence, delivering cost-effective care to the group is a priority. Preference-based measures of health status and health-related quality of life (HRQL) integrate morbidity and mortality and provide utility scores for the estimation of quality-adjusted life years to be used in cost-effectiveness analyses and economic evaluation. The generic preference-based instrument Health Utilities - Preschool (HuPS) measures the health status of young children and is applicable to the age group 2 to 5 years, who carry the highest incidence of cancer in childhood.
Methods
The translation of the HuPS classification system followed recommended protocols from published guidelines. Forward and backward translations were performed by a team of six qualified professionals and linguistic validation was undertaken with a sample of parents of preschool children.
Main results
Initial disagreements on individual words occurring in 0.5-1.5% were resolved by consensus. A final version of the instrument was validated by the sample of parents.
Conclusions
The translation and cultural adaptation of the HuPS into Brazilian Portuguese were accomplished as the first step in the validation of the HuPS instrument in Brazil.

Abstract: Summary
Passive cooling of high-power electronics with minimum energy and water input is critical for the global water-energy nexus but has been challenging because of the large fluctuation in power and heat loads between the on/off-peak hours. Here we develop a moisture thermal battery (MTB) by coating superabsorbent hydrogel onto a pin fin heat sink with a large surface. The MTB leverages large latent heat and high thermal conductance of water evaporation for electronics cooling during on-peak hours and, importantly, autonomously harvests atmospheric moisture and stores the water during off hours. The MTB provides a thermal capacity of up to ∼200 kWh m−2 for evaporative cooling with a record-high effective heat transfer coefficient of up to ∼1,000 W m−2 K−1 for a passive device (no external power). The MTB suppresses the temperature fluctuation of a high-power field effect transistor and a computer CPU between the on- and off-peak hours by ∼15 K.

Abstract: Summary
In the field of organic solar cells (OSCs), shoulder side-chain engineering on Y-series non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) has been the subject of great interest toward realizing high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Here, we report a procedure for post-attaching shoulder side chains on Y-series NFAs. Compared with the traditional procedure of pre-attaching side chains, this method has the advantages of using low-cost raw materials and of being more convenient for robustly attaching conjugated side chains. As a proof of concept, this method is successfully extended to the synthesis of oxygen (CY-O) and sulfur (CY-S) substituted alkylphenyl side chains. Interestingly, CY-O exhibits a higher crystallinity and suitable morphology and a better trade-off between charge separation rate and triplet generation processes. As a result, CY-O-based OSCs achieve a high PCE of 17.8% relative to that of CY-S (15.7%). Our results demonstrate that post-side-chain engineering is a convenient and low-cost method to construct high-performance NFAs.

Abstract: Summary
Controlling regioselectivity in activating C–H bonds in linear alkanes is challenging, as their multiple secondary C–H bonds have quite similar dissociation energies, with no functional groups to differentiate between the bonds. Here, we coupled a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT)-based radical generation center and an amide functional group on a tailor-designed metal-organic layer (MOL) material. We achieved efficient photochlorination of linear alkanes with 2-position selectivity. For example, with n-hexane as the substrate, 2-chloro-n-hexane was obtained with 85% selectivity and a turnover number of 2,200 in 8 h, together with a high apparent quantum yield of ∼7% at room temperature. Mechanistic experiments suggested that the chlorine generation and installation of an amide group are important for the orchestration of the reactivity and the selectivity.

Abstract: Summary
The prevalence of self-healing semiconductors is restricted to a few select cases, limiting understanding of the self-healing phenomenon. Herein, we report self-healing after photo-induced damage in antimony trichalcogenides and chalcoiodides, which are quasi-one-dimensional semiconductors with prospective applications in photovoltaics and electronic devices. We relate the self-healing to a photo-induced phase transition and the damaged state to a hidden phase from which the damaged semiconductors recover (self-heal). By using vibrational spectroscopy, we elucidate the intermediate species in the reaction. We suggest that the occurrence of bonding states at the bottom of the conduction band is central to promoting the hidden phase. Comparing four different materials with a similar crystal structure enables us to uncover the common structural feature that leads to the self-healing in these materials. Expanding the type and number of self-healing semiconductors, and uncovering the underlying solid-state reactions, will facilitate the development of self-healing electronic building blocks and devices.

Abstract: Summary
Many natural products contain compact cis-anti-cis-configurated 5/5/5 and 5/6/4 tricycles, and efficient access to these molecules is posing many hurdles to the synthetic community. Accessing molecules with more strained trans-anti-cis-configurated 5/5/5 tricycles (which are rarely found in nature) was envisioned to be more challenging, and no solution to this has been reported. We describe here a [5+2+1]/epoxidation/transannular radical cyclization strategy to solve the above-mentioned challenges, as demonstrated by the first total synthesis of (+)-antrodiellin B, the asymmetric total synthesis of (−)-hypnophilin, and the formal synthesis of (−)-coriolin, all of which contain a cis-anti-cis-configurated 5/5/5 skeleton, together with the synthesis of compounds with 5/6/4 and trans-anti-cis-configurated 5/5/5 tricycles. The present strategy is helpful for obtaining these and other molecules and their analogs for future downstream studies dependent on synthetic molecules with unusual scaffolds.
