Abstract: Summary
IL-1β is a cytokine of pivotal importance to the orchestration of inflammatory responses. Synthesized as an inactive pro-cytokine, IL-1β requires proteolytic maturation to gain biological activity. Here, we identify intrinsic apoptosis as a non-canonical trigger of IL-1β maturation. Guided by the discovery of the immunomodulatory activity of vioprolides, cyclic peptides isolated from myxobacteria, we observe IL-1β maturation independent of canonical inflammasome pathways, yet dependent on intrinsic apoptosis. Mechanistically, vioprolides inhibit MCL-1 and BCL2, which in turn triggers BAX/BAK-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Induction of MOMP results in the release of pro-apoptotic factors initiating intrinsic apoptosis, as well as the depletion of IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis proteins). IAP depletion, in turn, operates upstream of ripoptosome complex formation, subsequently resulting in caspase-8-dependent IL-1β maturation. These results establish the ripoptosome/caspase-8 complex as a pro-inflammatory checkpoint that senses the perturbation of mitochondrial integrity.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitous coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) decorates various RNAs in different organisms. In the proteobacterium Escherichia coli, the NAD-cap confers stability against RNA degradation. To date, NAD-RNAs have not been identified in any other bacterial microorganism. Here, we report the identification of NAD-RNA in the firmicute Bacillus subtilis. In the late exponential growth phase, predominantly mRNAs are NAD modified. NAD is incorporated de novo into RNA by the cellular RNA polymerase using non-canonical transcription initiation. The incorporation efficiency depends on the −1 position of the promoter but is independent of sigma factors or mutations in the rifampicin binding pocket. RNA pyrophosphohydrolase BsRppH is found to decap NAD-RNA. In vitro, the decapping activity is facilitated by manganese ions and single-stranded RNA 5′ ends. Depletion of BsRppH influences the gene expression of ∼13% of transcripts in B. subtilis. The NAD-cap stabilizes RNA against 5′-to-3′-exonucleolytic decay by RNase J1.

Abstract: Summary
The gene encoding the MEF2B transcription factor is mutated in germinal center (GC)-derived B cell lymphomas, but its role in GC development and lymphomagenesis is unknown. We demonstrate that Mef2b deletion reduces GC formation in mice and identify MEF2B transcriptional targets in GC, with roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, GC confinement, and differentiation. The most common lymphoma-associated MEF2B mutant (MEF2BD83V) is hypomorphic, yet escapes binding and negative regulation by components of the HUCA complex and class IIa HDACs. Mef2bD83V expression in mice leads to GC enlargement and lymphoma development, a phenotype that becomes fully penetrant in combination with BCL2 de-regulation, an event associated with human MEF2B mutations. These results identify MEF2B as a critical GC regulator and a driver oncogene in lymphomagenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional regulator YAP orchestrates many cellular functions, including tissue homeostasis, organ growth control, and tumorigenesis. Mechanical stimuli are a key input to YAP activity, but the mechanisms controlling this regulation remain largely uncharacterized. We show that CAV1 positively modulates the YAP mechanoresponse to substrate stiffness through actin-cytoskeleton-dependent and Hippo-kinase-independent mechanisms. RHO activity is necessary, but not sufficient, for CAV1-dependent mechanoregulation of YAP activity. Systematic quantitative interactomic studies and image-based small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens provide evidence that this actin-dependent regulation is determined by YAP interaction with the 14-3-3 protein YWHAH. Constitutive YAP activation rescued phenotypes associated with CAV1 loss, including defective extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. CAV1-mediated control of YAP activity was validated in vivo in a model of pancreatitis-driven acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. We propose that this CAV1-YAP mechanotransduction system controls a significant share of cell programs linked to these two pivotal regulators, with potentially broad physiological and pathological implications.

Abstract: Summary
Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) induces immune response by sensing viral double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). However, growing evidence suggests that PKR can also be activated by endogenously expressed dsRNAs. Here, we capture these dsRNAs by formaldehyde-mediated crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing and find that various noncoding RNAs interact with PKR. Surprisingly, the majority of the PKR-interacting RNA repertoire is occupied by mitochondrial RNAs (mtRNAs). MtRNAs can form intermolecular dsRNAs owing to bidirectional transcription of the mitochondrial genome and regulate PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation to control cell signaling and translation. Moreover, PKR activation by mtRNAs is counteracted by PKR phosphatases, disruption of which causes apoptosis from PKR overactivation even in uninfected cells. Our work unveils dynamic regulation of PKR even without infection and establishes PKR as a sensor for nuclear and mitochondrial signaling cues in regulating cellular metabolism.

Shiga Toxin/Lipopolysaccharide Activates Caspase-4 and Gasdermin D to Trigger Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species Upstream of the NLRP3 Inflammasome,

Abstract: Summary
The non-canonical caspase-4 and canonical NLRP3 inflammasomes are both activated by intracellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but the crosstalk between these two pathways remains unclear. Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2)/LPS complex, from pathogenic enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, activates caspase-4, gasdermin D (GSDMD), and the NLRP3 inflammasome in human THP-1 macrophages, but not mouse macrophages that lack the Stx receptor CD77. Stx2/LPS-mediated IL-1β secretion and pyroptosis are dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) downstream of the non-canonical caspase-4 inflammasome and cleaved GSDMD, which is enriched at the mitochondria. Blockade of caspase-4 activation and ROS generation as well as GSDMD deficiency significantly reduces Stx2/LPS-induced IL-1β production and pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a significant role in amplifying Stx2/LPS-induced GSDMD cleavage and pyroptosis, with significant reduction of these responses in NLRP3-deficient THP-1 cells. Together, these data show that Stx2/LPS complex activates the non-canonical inflammasome and mitochondrial ROS upstream of the NLRP3 inflammasome to promote cytokine maturation and pyroptosis.

Abstract: Summary
RNA splicing entails the coordinated interaction of more than 150 proteins in the spliceosome, one of the most complex of the cell’s molecular machines. We previously discovered that the RNA-binding motif protein 17 (RBM17), a component of the spliceosome, is essential for survival and cell maintenance. Here, we find that it interacts with the spliceosomal factors U2SURP and CHERP and that they reciprocally regulate each other’s stability, both in mouse and in human cells. Individual knockdown of each of the three proteins induces overlapping changes in splicing and gene expression of transcripts enriched for RNA-processing factors. Our results elucidate the function of RBM17, U2SURP, and CHERP and link the activity of the spliceosome to the regulation of downstream RNA-binding proteins. These data support the hypothesis that, beyond driving constitutive splicing, spliceosomal factors can regulate alternative splicing of specific targets.

Abstract: Summary
We generated a knockout mouse for the neuronal-specific β-tubulin isoform Tubb3 to investigate its role in nervous system formation and maintenance. Tubb3−/− mice have no detectable neurobehavioral or neuropathological deficits, and upregulation of mRNA and protein of the remaining β-tubulin isotypes results in equivalent total β-tubulin levels in Tubb3−/− and wild-type mice. Despite similar levels of total β-tubulin, adult dorsal root ganglia lacking TUBB3 have decreased growth cone microtubule dynamics and a decreased neurite outgrowth rate of 22% in vitro and in vivo. The effect of the 22% slower growth rate is exacerbated for sensory recovery, where fibers must reinnervate the full volume of the skin to recover touch function. Overall, these data reveal that, while TUBB3 is not required for formation of the nervous system, it has a specific role in the rate of peripheral axon regeneration that cannot be replaced by other β-tubulins.

Abstract: Summary
The signaling of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) through G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) CRTH2 is a major pathway in type 2 inflammation. Compelling evidence suggests the therapeutic benefits of blocking CRTH2 signaling in many inflammatory disorders. Currently, a number of CRTH2 antagonists are under clinical investigation, and one compound, fevipiprant, has advanced to phase 3 clinical trials for asthma. Here, we present the crystal structures of human CRTH2 with two antagonists, fevipiprant and CAY10471. The structures, together with docking and ligand-binding data, reveal a semi-occluded pocket covered by a well-structured amino terminus and different binding modes of chemically diverse CRTH2 antagonists. Structural analysis suggests a ligand entry port and a binding process that is facilitated by opposite charge attraction for PGD2, which differs significantly from the binding pose and binding environment of lysophospholipids and endocannabinoids, revealing a new mechanism for lipid recognition by GPCRs.

Abstract: Summary
Kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) are molecular motors that typically alter the subcellular localization of their cargos. However, the atypical kinesin KIF26A does not serve as a motor but can bind microtubules and affect cellular signaling cascades. Here, we show that KIF26A maintains intracellular calcium homeostasis and negatively regulates nociceptive sensation. Kif26a−/− mice exhibit intense and prolonged nociceptive responses. In their primary sensory neurons, excessive inhibitory phosphorylation of plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) mediated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) rendered the Ca transients resistant to termination, and the peripheral axonal outgrowth was significantly enhanced. Upstream, KIF26A is directly associated with a FERM domain of FAK and antagonizes FAK function in integrin-Src family kinase (SFK)-FAK signaling, possibly through steric hindrance and localization to cytoplasmic microtubules.

Abstract: Summary
The hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) regulates homeostasis through the passage of neurohormones and blood-borne proteins via permeable blood capillaries that lack the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Why neurohypophyseal capillaries become permeable while the neighboring vasculature of the brain forms BBB remains unclear. We show that pituicytes, the resident astroglial cells of the neurohypophysis, express genes that are associated with BBB breakdown during neuroinflammation. Pituicyte-enriched factors provide a local microenvironment that instructs a permeable neurovascular conduit. Thus, genetic and pharmacological perturbations of Vegfa and Tgfβ3 affected HNS vascular morphogenesis and permeability and impaired the expression of the fenestral marker plvap. The anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone decreased HNS permeability and downregulated the pituicyte-specific cyp26b gene, encoding a retinoic acid catabolic enzyme. Inhibition of Cyp26b activity led to upregulation of tight junction protein Claudin-5 and decreased permeability. We conclude that pituicyte-derived factors regulate the “decision” of endothelial cells to adopt a permeable endothelial fate instead of forming a BBB.

Abstract: Summary
Excitatory synaptic input reaches the soma of a cortical excitatory pyramidal neuron via anatomically segregated apical and basal dendrites. In vivo, dendritic inputs are integrated during depolarized network activity, but how network activity affects apical and basal inputs is not understood. Using subcellular two-photon stimulation of Channelrhodopsin2-expressing layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in somatosensory cortex, nucleus-specific thalamic optogenetic stimulation, and paired recordings, we show that slow, depolarized network activity amplifies small-amplitude synaptic inputs targeted to basal dendrites but reduces the amplitude of all inputs from apical dendrites and the cell soma. Intracellular pharmacology and mathematical modeling suggests that the amplification of weak basal inputs is mediated by postsynaptic voltage-gated channels. Thus, network activity dynamically reconfigures the relative somatic contribution of apical and basal inputs and could act to enhance the detectability of weak synaptic inputs.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-reactive T cell exhaustion prevents the success of immune therapies. Pegilodecakin activates intratumoral CD8+ T cells in mice and induces objective tumor responses in patients. Here we report that pegilodecakin induces hallmarks of CD8+ T cell immunity in cancer patients, including elevation of interferon-γ and GranzymeB, expansion and activation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells, and proliferation and expansion of LAG-3+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cells. On pegilodecakin, newly expanded T cell clones, undetectable at baseline, become 1%–10% of the total T cell repertoire in the blood. Elevation of interleukin-18, expansion of LAG-3+ PD-1+ T cells and novel T cell clones each correlated with objective tumor responses. Combined pegilodecakin with anti-PD-1 increased the expansion of LAG-3+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cells.

Abstract: Insulin resistance is closely associated with metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension and atherosclerosis. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have been developed to ameliorate insulin resistance by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ. Although TZDs are synthetic ligands for PPARγ, metabolic outcomes of each TZD are different. Moreover, there are lack of head-to-head comparative studies among TZDs in the aspect of metabolic outcomes. In this study, we analyzed the effects of three TZDs, including lobeglitazone (Lobe), rosiglitazone (Rosi), and pioglitazone (Pio) on metabolic and thermogenic regulation. In adipocytes, Lobe more potently stimulated adipogenesis and insulin-dependent glucose uptake than Rosi and Pio. In the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli, Lobe efficiently suppressed expressions of pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages and adipocytes. In obese and diabetic db/db mice, Lobe effectively promoted insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and suppressed pro-inflammatory responses in epididymal white adipose tissue (EAT), leading to improve glucose intolerance. Compared to other two TZDs, Lobe enhanced beige adipocyte formation and thermogenic gene expression in inguinal white adipose tissue (IAT) of lean mice, which would be attributable to cold-induced thermogenesis. Collectively, these comparison data suggest that Lobe could relieve insulin resistance and enhance thermogenesis at low-concentration conditions where Rosi and Pio are less effective.

Abstract: Summary
Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step in the expression of most human genes. Mutations at the 5′ splice site (5′ss) frequently cause defective splicing and disease due to interference with the initial recognition of the exon-intron boundary by U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), a component of the spliceosome. Here, we use a massively parallel splicing assay (MPSA) in human cells to quantify the activity of all 32,768 unique 5′ss sequences (NNN/GYNNNN) in three different gene contexts. Our results reveal that although splicing efficiency is mostly governed by the 5′ss sequence, there are substantial differences in this efficiency across gene contexts. Among other uses, these MPSA measurements facilitate the prediction of 5′ss sequence variants that are likely to cause aberrant splicing. This approach provides a framework to assess potential pathogenic variants in the human genome and streamline the development of splicing-corrective therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The genome of pluripotent stem cells adopts a unique three-dimensional architecture featuring weakly condensed heterochromatin and large nucleosome-free regions. Yet, it is unknown whether structural loops and contact domains display characteristics that distinguish embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from differentiated cell types. We used genome-wide chromosome conformation capture and super-resolution imaging to determine nuclear organization in mouse ESC and neural stem cell (NSC) derivatives. We found that loss of pluripotency is accompanied by widespread gain of structural loops. This general architectural change correlates with enhanced binding of CTCF and cohesins and more pronounced insulation of contacts across chromatin boundaries in lineage-committed cells. Reprogramming NSCs to pluripotency restores the unique features of ESC domain topology. Domains defined by the anchors of loops established upon differentiation are enriched for developmental genes. Chromatin loop formation is a pervasive structural alteration to the genome that accompanies exit from pluripotency and delineates the spatial segregation of developmentally regulated genes.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic trafficking of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptors (AMPARs) to synapses is critical for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory, but the identity of key molecular effectors remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that membrane depolarization and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation triggers secretion of the chemotropic guidance cue netrin-1 from dendrites. Using selective genetic deletion, we show that netrin-1 expression by excitatory neurons is required for NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the adult hippocampus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that application of exogenous netrin-1 is sufficient to trigger the potentiation of excitatory glutamatergic transmission at hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses via Ca2+-dependent recruitment of GluA1-containing AMPARs, promoting the maturation of immature or nascent synapses. These findings identify a central role for activity-dependent release of netrin-1 as a critical effector of synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus.

Abstract: Summary
The heavy occupancy of transposons in the genome implies that existing organisms have survived from multiple, independent rounds of transposon invasions. However, how and which host cell types survive the initial wave of transposon invasion remain unclear. We show that the germline stem cells can initiate a robust adaptive response that rapidly endogenizes invading P element transposons by activating the DNA damage checkpoint and piRNA production. We find that temperature modulates the P element activity in germline stem cells, establishing a powerful tool to trigger transposon hyper-activation. Facing vigorous invasion, Drosophila first shut down oogenesis and induce selective apoptosis. Interestingly, a robust adaptive response occurs in ovarian stem cells through activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. Within 4 days, the hosts amplify P element-silencing piRNAs, repair DNA damage, subdue the transposon, and reinitiate oogenesis. We propose that this robust adaptive response can bestow upon organisms the ability to survive recurrent transposon invasions throughout evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Centrosomes are the major microtubule-organizing centers, consisting of centrioles surrounded by a pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrosomal PCM is spatiotemporally regulated to be minimal during interphase and expands as cells enter mitosis. It is unclear how PCM expansion is initiated at the onset of mitosis. Here, we identify that, in Drosophila, Plk1/Polo kinase phosphorylates the conserved centrosomal protein Sas-4 in vitro. This phosphorylation appears to occur at the onset of mitosis, enabling Sas-4’s localization to expand outward from meiotic and mitotic centrosomes. The Plk1/Polo kinase site of Sas-4 is then required for an efficient recruitment of Cnn and γ-tubulin, bona fide PCM proteins that are essential for PCM expansion and centrosome maturation. Point mutations at Plk1/Polo sites of Sas-4 affect neither centrosome structure nor centriole duplication but specifically reduce the affinity to bind Cnn and γ-tubulin. These observations identify Plk1/Polo kinase regulation of Sas-4 as essential for efficient PCM expansion.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome profiling, or Ribo-seq, is based on large-scale sequencing of RNA fragments protected from nuclease digestion by ribosomes. Thanks to its unique ability to provide positional information about ribosomes flowing along transcripts, this method can be used to shed light on mechanistic aspects of translation. However, current Ribo-seq approaches lack the ability to distinguish between fragments protected by either ribosomes in active translation or inactive ribosomes. To overcome this possible limitation, we developed RiboLace, a method based on an original puromycin-containing molecule capable of isolating active ribosomes by means of an antibody-free and tag-free pull-down approach. RiboLace is fast, works reliably with low amounts of input material, and can be easily and rapidly applied both in vitro and in vivo, thereby generating a global snapshot of active ribosome footprints at single nucleotide resolution.

Abstract: Summary
The RING E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1 controls DNA methylation through its ability to target the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 to newly replicated chromatin. DNMT1 recruitment relies on ubiquitylation of histone H3 by UHRF1; however, how UHRF1 deposits ubiquitin onto the histone is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) of UHRF1 is essential for RING-mediated H3 ubiquitylation. Using chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry, biochemical assays, and recombinant chromatin substrates, we show that the UBL participates in structural rearrangements of UHRF1 upon binding to chromatin and the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcH5a/UBE2D1. Similar to ubiquitin, the UBL exerts its effects through a hydrophobic patch that contacts a regulatory surface on the “backside” of the E2 to stabilize the E2-E3-chromatin complex. Our analysis of the enzymatic mechanism of UHRF1 uncovers an unexpected function of the UBL domain and defines a new role for this domain in DNMT1-dependent inheritance of DNA methylation.

Abstract: Summary
Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a cytoprotective enzyme that controls inflammatory responses and redox homeostasis; however, its role during pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) remains unclear. Using freshly resected human TB lung tissue, we examined the role of HO-1 within the cellular and pathological spectrum of TB. Flow cytometry and histopathological analysis of human TB lung tissues showed that HO-1 is expressed primarily in myeloid cells and that HO-1 levels in these cells were directly proportional to cytoprotection. HO-1 mitigates TB pathophysiology by diminishing myeloid cell-mediated oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen intermediates, which control granulocytic karyorrhexis to generate a zonal HO-1 response. Using whole-body or myeloid-specific HO-1-deficient mice, we demonstrate that HO-1 is required to control myeloid cell infiltration and inflammation to protect against TB progression. Overall, this study reveals that zonation of HO-1 in myeloid cells modulates free-radical-mediated stress, which regulates human TB immunopathology.

Abstract: Summary
Increased aerobic glycolysis is a hallmark of cancer metabolism. How cancer cells coordinate glucose metabolism with extracellular glucose levels remains largely unknown. Here, we report that coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1 or PRMT4) signals glucose availability to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and suppresses glycolysis in liver cancer cells. CARM1 methylates GAPDH at arginine 234 (R234), inhibiting its catalytic activity. Glucose starvation leads to CARM1 upregulation, further inducing R234 hypermethylation and GAPDH inhibition. The re-expression of wild-type GAPDH, but not of its methylation-mimetic mutant, sustains glycolytic levels. CARM1 inhibition increases glycolytic flux and glycolysis. R234 methylation delays tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Compared with normal tissues, R234 is hypomethylated in malignant clinical hepatocellular carcinoma samples. Notably, R234 methylation positively correlates with CARM1 expression in these liver cancer samples. Our findings thus reveal that CARM1-mediated GAPDH methylation is a key regulatory mechanism of glucose metabolism in liver cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic inflammation and fibrosis characterize Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We show that pro-inflammatory macrophages are associated with fibrosis in mouse and human DMD muscle. DMD-derived Ly6Cpos macrophages exhibit a profibrotic activity by sustaining fibroblast production of collagen I. This is mediated by the high production of latent-TGF-β1 due to the higher expression of LTBP4, for which polymorphisms are associated with the progression of fibrosis in DMD patients. Skewing macrophage phenotype via AMPK activation decreases ltbp4 expression by Ly6Cpos macrophages, blunts the production of latent-TGF-β1, and eventually reduces fibrosis and improves DMD muscle force. Moreover, fibro-adipogenic progenitors are the main providers of TGF-β-activating enzymes in mouse and human DMD, leading to collagen production by fibroblasts. In vivo pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β-activating enzymes improves the dystrophic phenotype. Thus, an AMPK-LTBP4 axis in inflammatory macrophages controls the production of TGF-β1, which is further activated by and acts on fibroblastic cells, leading to fibrosis in DMD.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations affecting RNA splicing factors are the most common genetic alterations in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and occur in a mutually exclusive manner. The basis for the mutual exclusivity of these mutations and how they contribute to MDS is not well understood. Here we report that although different spliceosome gene mutations impart distinct effects on splicing, they are negatively selected for when co-expressed due to aberrant splicing and downregulation of regulators of hematopoietic stem cell survival and quiescence. In addition to this synthetic lethal interaction, mutations in the splicing factors SF3B1 and SRSF2 share convergent effects on aberrant splicing of mRNAs that promote nuclear factor κB signaling. These data identify shared consequences of splicing-factor mutations and the basis for their mutual exclusivity.

Abstract: Summary
How mitochondrial metabolism is altered by oncogenic tyrosine kinases to promote tumor growth is incompletely understood. Here, we show that oncogenic HER2 tyrosine kinase signaling induces phosphorylation of mitochondrial creatine kinase 1 (MtCK1) on tyrosine 153 (Y153) in an ABL-dependent manner in breast cancer cells. Y153 phosphorylation, which is commonly upregulated in HER2+ breast cancers, stabilizes MtCK1 to increase the phosphocreatine energy shuttle and promote proliferation. Inhibition of the phosphocreatine energy shuttle by MtCK1 knockdown or with the creatine analog cyclocreatine decreases proliferation of trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant HER2+ cell lines in culture and in xenografts. Finally, we show that cyclocreatine in combination with the HER2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib reduces the growth of a trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ patient-derived xenograft. These findings suggest that activation of the phosphocreatine energy shuttle by MtCK1 Y153 phosphorylation creates a druggable metabolic vulnerability in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Steroid hormones are a group of lipophilic hormones that are believed to enter cells by simple diffusion to regulate diverse physiological processes through intracellular nuclear receptors. Here, we challenge this model in Drosophila by demonstrating that Ecdysone Importer (EcI), a membrane transporter identified from two independent genetic screens, is involved in cellular uptake of the steroid hormone ecdysone. EcI encodes an organic anion transporting polypeptide of the evolutionarily conserved solute carrier organic anion superfamily. In vivo, EcI loss of function causes phenotypes indistinguishable from ecdysone- or ecdysone receptor (EcR)-deficient animals, and EcI knockdown inhibits cellular uptake of ecdysone. Furthermore, EcI regulates ecdysone signaling in a cell-autonomous manner and is both necessary and sufficient for inducing ecdysone-dependent gene expression in culture cells expressing EcR. Altogether, our results challenge the simple diffusion model for cellular uptake of ecdysone and may have wide implications for basic and medical aspects of steroid hormone studies.

Abstract: Summary
The fate of disseminated tumor cells is largely determined by microenvironment (ME) niche. The osteogenic niche promotes cancer cell proliferation and bone metastasis progression. We investigated the underlying mechanisms using pre-clinical models and analyses of clinical data. We discovered that the osteogenic niche serves as a calcium (Ca) reservoir for cancer cells through gap junctions. Cancer cells cannot efficiently absorb Ca from ME, but depend on osteogenic cells to increase intracellular Ca concentration. The Ca signaling, together with previously identified mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, promotes bone metastasis progression. Interestingly, effective inhibition of these pathways can be achieved by danusertib, or a combination of everolimus and arsenic trioxide, which provide possibilities of eliminating bone micrometastases using clinically established drugs.

Abstract: Summary
The role of CD4+ T cells in the ischemic tissues of T2D patients remains unclear. Here, we report that T2D patients’ vascular density was negatively correlated with the number of infiltrating CD4+ T cells after ischemic injury. Th1 was the predominant subset, and Th1-derived IFN-γ and TNF-α directly impaired human angiogenesis. We then blocked CD4+ T cell infiltration into the ischemic tissues of both Leprdb/db and diet-induced obese T2D mice. Genome-wide RNA sequencing shows an increased proliferative and angiogenic capability of diabetic ECs in ischemic tissues. Moreover, wire myography shows enhanced EC function and laser Doppler imaging reveals improved post-ischemic blood reperfusion. Mechanistically, functional revascularization after CD4 coreceptor blockade was mediated by Tregs. Genetic lineage tracing via Cdh5-CreER and Apln-CreER and coculture assays further illustrate that Tregs increased vascular density and induced de novo sprouting angiogenesis in a paracrine manner. Taken together, our results reveal that Th1 impaired while Tregs promoted functional post-ischemic revascularization in obesity and diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Expression of aberrantly spliced BRAF V600E isoforms (BRAF V600E ΔEx) mediates resistance in 13%–30% of melanoma patients progressing on RAF inhibitors. BRAF V600E ΔEx confers resistance, in part, through enhanced dimerization. Here, we uncoupled BRAF V600E ΔEx dimerization from maintenance of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling. Furthermore, we show BRAF V600E ΔEx association with its substrate, MEK, is enhanced and required for RAF inhibitor resistance. RAF inhibitor treatment increased phosphorylation at serine 729 (S729) in BRAF V600E ΔEx. Mutation of S729 to a non-phosphorylatable residue reduced BRAF V600E ΔEx-MEK interaction, reduced dimerization or oligomerization, and increased RAF inhibitor sensitivity. Conversely, mutation of the BRAF dimerization domain elicited partial effects on MEK association and RAF inhibitor sensitivity. Our data implicate BRAF S729 in resistance to RAF inhibitor and underscore the importance of substrate association with BRAF V600E ΔEx. These findings may provide opportunities to target resistance driven by aberrantly spliced forms of BRAF V600E.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by immune tolerance and immunotherapeutic resistance. We discovered upregulation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIP1) in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in PDA. To study its role in oncogenic progression, we developed a selective small-molecule RIP1 inhibitor with high in vivo exposure. Targeting RIP1 reprogrammed TAMs toward an MHCIIhiTNFα+IFNγ+ immunogenic phenotype in a STAT1-dependent manner. RIP1 inhibition in TAMs resulted in cytotoxic T cell activation and T helper cell differentiation toward a mixed Th1/Th17 phenotype, leading to tumor immunity in mice and in organotypic models of human PDA. Targeting RIP1 synergized with PD1-and inducible co-stimulator-based immunotherapies. Tumor-promoting effects of RIP1 were independent of its co-association with RIP3. Collectively, our work describes RIP1 as a checkpoint kinase governing tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Current models of SIRT1 enzymatic regulation primarily consider the effects of fluctuating levels of its co-substrate NAD+, which binds to the stably folded catalytic domain. By contrast, the roles of the sizeable disordered N- and C-terminal regions of SIRT1 are largely unexplored. Here we identify an insulin-responsive sensor in the SIRT1 N-terminal region (NTR), comprising an acidic cluster (AC) and a 3-helix bundle (3HB), controlling deacetylase activity. The allosteric assistor DBC1 removes a distal N-terminal shield from the 3-helix bundle, permitting PACS-2 to engage the acidic cluster and the transiently exposed helix 3 of the 3-helix bundle, disrupting its structure and inhibiting catalysis. The SIRT1 activator (STAC) SRT1720 binds and stabilizes the 3-helix bundle, protecting SIRT1 from inhibition by PACS-2. Identification of the SIRT1 insulin-responsive sensor and its engagement by the DBC1 and PACS-2 regulatory hub provides important insight into the roles of disordered regions in enzyme regulation and the mode by which STACs promote metabolic fitness.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive cancers presenting with high rates of invasion and metastasis, and unfavorable prognoses. The current study aims to investigate whether EZH2/miR-139-5p axis affects epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and lymph node metastasis (LNM) in PC, and the mechanism how EZH2 regulates miR-139-5p. Human PC and adjacent normal tissues were collected to determine expression of EZH2 and miR-139-5p, and their relationship with clinicopathological features of PC. Human PC cell line was selected, and treated with miR-139-5p mimics/inhibitors, EZH2 vector or shEZH2 in order to validate the regulation of EZH2-mediated miR-139-5p in PC cells. Dual-luciferase report gene assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were employed to identify the relationship between miR-139-5p and EZH2. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were conducted to determine the expression of miR-139-5p, EZH2 and EMT-related markers and ZEB1/2. Tumor formation ability and in vitro cell activity were also analyzed. Highly-expressed EZH2 and poorly-expressed miR-139-5p were detected in PC tissues, and miR-139-5p and EZH2 expressions were associated with patients at Stage III/IV, with LNM and highly-differentiated tumors. EZH2 suppressed the expression of miR-139-5p through up-regulating Histone 3 Lysine 27 Trimethylation (H3K27me3). EMT, cell proliferation, migration and invasion were impeded, and tumor formation and LNM were reduced in PC cells transfected with miR-139-5p mimics and shEZH2. MiR-139-5p transcription is inhibited by EZH2 through up-regulating H3K27me3, thereby down-regulation of EZH2 and up-regulation of miR-139-5p impede EMT and LNM in PC. In addition, the EZH2/miR-139-5p axis presents as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PC.

The ability of cells to stably maintain their fate is governed by specific transcription regulators.

Using Targeted DamID, we find that Sd and Nerfin-1 occupy a highly overlapping set of target genes, including regulators of neural stem cell and neuron fate, and signaling pathways that regulate CNS development such as Notch and Hippo. Modulation of either Sd or Nerfin-1 activity causes medulla neurons to dedifferentiate to a stem cell-like state, and this is mediated at least in part by Notch pathway deregulation. Intriguingly, orthologs of Sd and Nerfin-1 have also been implicated in control of neuronal cell fate decisions in both worms and mammals. Our data indicate that this transcription factor pair exhibits remarkable biochemical and functional conservation across metazoans.

Abstract: Summary
Cells in multicellular organisms are arranged in complex three-dimensional patterns. This requires both transient and stable adhesions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin adhesion receptors bind ECM ligands outside the cell and then, by binding the protein talin inside the cell, assemble an adhesion complex connecting to the cytoskeleton. The activity of talin is controlled by several mechanisms, but these have not been well studied in vivo. By generating mice containing the activating point mutation E1770A in talin (Tln1), which disrupts autoinhibition, we show that talin autoinhibition controls cell-ECM adhesion, cell migration, and wound healing in vivo. In particular, blocking autoinhibition gives rise to more mature, stable focal adhesions that exhibit increased integrin activation. Mutant cells also show stronger attachment to ECM and decreased traction force. Overall, these results demonstrate that modulating talin function via autoinhibition is an important mechanism for regulating multiple aspects of integrin-mediated cell-ECM adhesion in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Prevailing dogma holds that ribosomes are uniform in composition and function. Here, we show that nutrient limitation-induced stress in E. coli changes the relative expression of rDNA operons to alter the rRNA composition within the actively translating ribosome pool. The most upregulated operon encodes the unique 16S rRNA, rrsH, distinguished by conserved sequence variation within the small ribosomal subunit. rrsH-bearing ribosomes affect the expression of functionally coherent gene sets and alter the levels of the RpoS sigma factor, the master regulator of the general stress response. These impacts are associated with phenotypic changes in antibiotic sensitivity, biofilm formation, and cell motility and are regulated by stress response proteins, RelA and RelE, as well as the metabolic enzyme and virulence-associated protein, AdhE. These findings establish that endogenously encoded, naturally occurring rRNA sequence variation can modulate ribosome function, central aspects of gene expression regulation, and cellular physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Ca2+-permeable AMPA-type glutamate receptors (CP-AMPARs) containing GluA1 but lacking GluA2 subunits contribute to multiple forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP), but mechanisms regulating CP-AMPARs are poorly understood. A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) 150 scaffolds kinases and phosphatases to regulate GluA1 phosphorylation and trafficking, and trafficking of AKAP150 itself is modulated by palmitoylation on two Cys residues. Here, we developed a palmitoylation-deficient knockin mouse to show that AKAP150 palmitoylation regulates CP-AMPAR incorporation at hippocampal synapses. Using biochemical, super-resolution imaging, and electrophysiological approaches, we found that palmitoylation promotes AKAP150 localization to recycling endosomes and the postsynaptic density (PSD) to limit CP-AMPAR basal synaptic incorporation. In addition, we found that AKAP150 palmitoylation is required for LTP induced by weaker stimulation that recruits CP-AMPARs to synapses but not stronger stimulation that recruits GluA2-containing AMPARs. Thus, AKAP150 palmitoylation controls its subcellular localization to maintain proper basal and activity-dependent regulation of synaptic AMPAR subunit composition.

Abstract: Summary
CD47 on tumor cells protects from phagocytosis, while PD-L1 dampens T cell-mediated tumor killing. However, whether and how CD47 and PD-L1 coordinate is poorly understood. We reveal that CD47 and PD-L1 on tumor cells coordinately suppress innate and adaptive sensing to evade immune control. Targeted blockade of both CD47 and PD-L1 on tumor cells with a bispecific anti-PD-L1-SIRPα showed significantly enhanced tumor targeting and therapeutic efficacy versus monotherapy. Mechanistically, systemic delivery of the dual-targeting heterodimer significantly increased DNA sensing, DC cross-presentation, and anti-tumor T cell response. In addition, chemotherapy that increases “eat me” signaling further synergizes with the bispecific reagent for better tumor control. Our data indicate that tumor cells evolve to utilize both innate and adaptive checkpoints to evade anti-tumor immune responses and that tumor cell-specific dual-targeting of both checkpoints represents an improved strategy for tumor immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Hürthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid (HCC) is a form of thyroid cancer recalcitrant to radioiodine therapy that exhibits an accumulation of mitochondria. We performed whole-exome sequencing on a cohort of primary, recurrent, and metastatic tumors, and identified recurrent mutations in DAXX, TP53, NRAS, NF1, CDKN1A, ARHGAP35, and the TERT promoter. Parallel analysis of mtDNA revealed recurrent homoplasmic mutations in subunits of complex I of the electron transport chain. Analysis of DNA copy-number alterations uncovered widespread loss of chromosomes culminating in near-haploid chromosomal content in a large fraction of HCC, which was maintained during metastatic spread. This work uncovers a distinct molecular origin of HCC compared with other thyroid malignancies.

Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) controls cellular behaviors such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The decellularized matrix of mammalian tissues has been used as a scaffold for the repair and reconstruction of tissue defects. In this study, for the first time demineralized and decellularized human epiphyseal bone matrix was used as a scaffold for a bone generation. Human epiphyseal bone was demineralized by hydrochloric acid and then decellularized by three methods of physical (slow freezing and snap freeze-thaw), enzymatic (trypsin 0.25%, 18 h) and chemical sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),)2.5%, 26 h). The scaffolds were cultured with rat adherent bone marrow cells (RABMC). Then, the histological studies were performed on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 of the culture to observe the distribution and morphology of cells. Bone formation was also investigated using Alizarin red staining. The results of this study indicated that RABMC migrated, proliferated and separated by forming lacuna in this three-dimensional bone scaffold. In addition, the Alizarin red staining indicated the calcium deposition on the scaffold in both bone differentiation and standard culture medium. The natural characteristic of the present bone scaffold, its cell adhesion features and capability to induce bone mineralization, even in the standard culture medium, provides a potentially optimal bone scaffold for bone tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
High-risk human papilloma viruses (HPVs) cause cervical, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers, unlike the low-risk HPVs, which cause benign lesions. E6 oncoproteins from the high-risk strains are essential for cell proliferation and transformation in HPV-induced cancers. We report that a cellular deubiquitinase, USP46, is selectively recruited by the E6 of high-risk, but not low-risk, HPV to deubiqutinate and stabilize Cdt2/DTL. Stabilization of Cdt2, a component of the CRL4Cdt2 E3 ubiquitin ligase, limits the level of Set8, an epigenetic writer, and promotes cell proliferation. USP46 is essential for the proliferation of HPV-transformed cells, but not of cells without HPV. Cdt2 is elevated in human cervical cancers and knockdown of USP46 inhibits HPV-transformed tumor growth in xenografts. Recruitment of a cellular deubiquitinase to stabilize key cellular proteins is an important activity of oncogenic E6, and the importance of E6-USP46-Cdt2-Set8 pathway in HPV-induced cancers makes USP46 a target for the therapy of such cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Induction of protective vaccine responses, governed by the successful generation of antigen-specific antibodies and long-lived memory T cells, is increasingly impaired with age. Regulation of the T cell proteome by a dynamic network of microRNAs is crucial to T cell responses. Here, we show that activation-induced upregulation of miR-21 biases the transcriptome of differentiating T cells away from memory T cells and toward inflammatory effector T cells. Such a transcriptome bias is also characteristic of T cell responses in older individuals who have increased miR-21 expression and is reversed by antagonizing miR-21. miR-21 targets negative feedback circuits in several signaling pathways. The concerted, sustained activity of these signaling pathways in miR-21high T cells disfavors the induction of transcription factor networks involved in memory cell differentiation. Our data suggest that curbing miR-21 upregulation or activity in older individuals may improve their ability to mount effective vaccine responses.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in CEP290 cause ciliogenesis defects, leading to diverse clinical phenotypes, including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Gene therapy for CEP290-associated diseases is hindered by the 7.4 kb CEP290 coding sequence, which is difficult to deliver in vivo. The multi-domain structure of the CEP290 protein suggests that a specific CEP290 domain may complement disease phenotypes. Thus, we constructed AAV vectors with overlapping CEP290 regions and evaluated their impact on photoreceptor degeneration in Cep290rd16/rd16 and Cep290rd16/rd16;Nrl−/− mice, two models of CEP290-LCA. One CEP290 fragment (the C-terminal 989 residues, including the domain deleted in mutant mice) reconstituted CEP290 function and resulted in cone preservation and delayed rod death. The CEP290 C-terminal domain also improved cilia phenotypes in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and iPSC-derived retinal organoids carrying the Cep290rd16 mutation. Our study strongly argues for in trans complementation of CEP290 mutations by a cognate fragment and suggests therapeutic avenues.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon occurring in mammals and flowering plants, causing genes to be expressed depending on their parent of origin. In plants, genomic imprinting is mainly confined to the endosperm, a nutritive tissue supporting embryo growth, similar to the placenta in mammals. Here, we show that the paternally expressed imprinted gene PEG2 transcript sequesters the transposable element (TE)-derived small interfering RNA (siRNA) siRNA854 in the endosperm. siRNA854 is present in the vegetative cell of pollen and transferred to the central cell of the female gametophyte after fertilization, where it is captured by PEG2. Depletion of siRNA854 as a consequence of increased PEG2 transcript levels establishes a reproductive barrier and prevents successful hybridizations between plants differing in chromosome number (ploidy). Thus, the balance of a male gamete accumulating TE-derived siRNA and a paternally expressed imprinted gene regulate triploid seed viability, revealing a transgenerational speciation mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Many active eukaryotic gene promoters exhibit divergent noncoding transcription, but the mechanisms restricting expression of these transcripts are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate how a sequence-specific transcription factor represses divergent noncoding transcription at highly expressed genes in yeast. We find that depletion of the transcription factor Rap1 induces noncoding transcription in a large fraction of Rap1-regulated gene promoters. Specifically, Rap1 prevents transcription initiation at cryptic promoters near its binding sites, which is uncoupled from transcription regulation in the protein-coding direction. We further provide evidence that Rap1 acts independently of previously described chromatin-based mechanisms to repress cryptic or divergent transcription. Finally, we show that divergent transcription in the absence of Rap1 is elicited by the RSC chromatin remodeler. We propose that a sequence-specific transcription factor limits access of basal transcription machinery to regulatory elements and adjacent sequences that act as divergent cryptic promoters, thereby providing directionality toward productive transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Pulmonary immunological tolerance to inhaled particulates might create a permissive milieu for lung metastasis. Lung microbiota contribute to pulmonary tolerance; here, we explored whether its manipulation via antibiotic or probiotic aerosolization favors immune response against melanoma metastasis. In lungs of vancomycin/neomycin-aerosolized mice, a decrease in bacterial load was associated with reduced regulatory T cells and enhanced T cell and NK cell activation that paralleled a significant reduction of melanoma B16 lung metastases. Reduction of metastases also occurred in lungs transplanted with bacterial isolates from antibiotic-treated lungs. Aerosolized Lactobacillus rhamnosus strongly promoted immunity against B16 lung metastases as well. Furthermore, probiotics or antibiotics improved chemotherapy activity against advanced B16 metastases. Thus, we identify a role for lung microbiota in metastasis and show that its targeting via aerosolization is a therapy that can prevent metastases and enhance responses to chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
TERT promoter mutations reactivate telomerase, allowing for indefinite telomere maintenance and enabling cellular immortalization. These mutations specifically recruit the multimeric ETS factor GABP, which can form two functionally independent transcription factor species: a dimer or a tetramer. We show that genetic disruption of GABPβ1L (β1L), a tetramer-forming isoform of GABP that is dispensable for normal development, results in TERT silencing in a TERT promoter mutation-dependent manner. Reducing TERT expression by disrupting β1L culminates in telomere loss and cell death exclusively in TERT promoter mutant cells. Orthotopic xenografting of β1L-reduced, TERT promoter mutant glioblastoma cells rendered lower tumor burden and longer overall survival in mice. These results highlight the critical role of GABPβ1L in enabling immortality in TERT promoter mutant glioblastoma.

Abstract: Summary
NAD+ is a key metabolic redox cofactor that is regenerated from nicotinamide through the NAD+ salvage pathway. Here, we find that inhibiting the NAD+ salvage pathway depletes serine biosynthesis from glucose by impeding the NAD+-dependent protein, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). Importantly, we find that PHGDHhigh breast cancer cell lines are exquisitely sensitive to inhibition of the NAD+ salvage pathway. Further, we find that PHGDH protein levels and those of the rate-limiting enzyme of NAD+ salvage, NAMPT, correlate in ER-negative, basal-like breast cancers. Although NAD+ salvage pathway inhibitors are actively being pursued in cancer treatment, their efficacy has been poor, and our findings suggest that they may be effective for PHGDH-dependent cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Transforming members of the MYC family (MYC, MYCL1, and MYCN) encode transcription factors containing six highly conserved regions, termed MYC homology boxes (MBs). By conducting proteomic profiling of the MB interactomes, we demonstrate that half of the MYC interactors require one or more MBs for binding. Comprehensive phenotypic analyses reveal that two MBs, MB0 and MBII, are universally required for transformation. MBII mediates interactions with acetyltransferase-containing complexes, enabling histone acetylation, and is essential for MYC-dependent tumor initiation. By contrast, MB0 mediates interactions with transcription elongation factors via direct binding to the general transcription factor TFIIF. MB0 is dispensable for tumor initiation but is a major accelerator of tumor growth. Notably, the full transforming activity of MYC can be restored by co-expression of the non-transforming MB0 and MBII deletion proteins, indicating that these two regions confer separate molecular functions, both of which are required for oncogenic MYC activity.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is prevalent, but the mechanisms underlying disease development remain elusive. We identify a role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5 in IBD. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) express a high level of RNF5, while the colon of Rnf5−/− mice exhibits activated dendritic cells and intrinsic inflammation. Rnf5−/− mice exhibit severe acute colitis following dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment. S100A8 is identified as an RNF5 substrate, resulting in S100A8 ubiquitination and proteasomal-dependent degradation that is attenuated upon inflammatory stimuli. Loss of RNF5 from IECs leads to enhanced S100A8 secretion, which induces mucosal CD4+ T cells, resulting in Th1 pro-inflammatory responses. Administration of S100A8-neutralizing antibodies to DSS-treated Rnf5−/− mice attenuates acute colitis development and increases survival. An inverse correlation between RNF5 and S100A8 protein expression in IECs of IBD patients coincides with disease severity. Collectively, RNF5-mediated regulation of S100A8 stability in IECs is required for the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
mRNAs form ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) by association with proteins that are crucial for mRNA metabolism. While the mRNP proteome has been well characterized, little is known about mRNP organization. Using a single-molecule approach, we show that mRNA conformation changes depending on its cellular localization and translational state. Compared to nuclear mRNPs and lncRNPs, association with ribosomes decompacts individual mRNAs, while pharmacologically dissociating ribosomes or sequestering them into stress granules leads to increased compaction. Moreover, translating mRNAs rarely show co-localized 5′ and 3′ ends, indicating either that mRNAs are not translated in a closed-loop configuration, or that mRNA circularization is transient, suggesting that a stable closed-loop conformation is not a universal state for all translating mRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
The precise wiring of synaptic connections requires the elimination of supernumerary inputs competing for innervation of the same target cell. This competition is activity-dependent, strengthening some inputs whereas others are eliminated. Although glial cells are required for the elimination and clearance of terminals, their involvement in activity-dependent synaptic competition remains ill-defined. Here, we used the developing neuromuscular junctions of mice to show that perisynaptic glial cells, through 2Y1 purinergic receptors (P2Y1Rs), decode synaptic efficacy of competing terminals in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This glial activity induces long-lasting synaptic potentiation of strong but not weak terminals via presynaptic adenosine 2A receptors. Blockade of glial activity by intracellular Ca2+ chelation or blockade of P2Y1Rs prevents this plasticity. In addition, blockade of P2Y1Rs delays synapse elimination in vivo. Hence, P2Y1Rs drive glial cell regulation of strong synaptic inputs and influence synapse competition and elimination.

Abstract: Summary
NusG/Spt5 proteins are the only transcription factors utilized by all cellular organisms. In enterobacteria, NusG antagonizes the transcription termination activity of Rho, a hexameric helicase, during the synthesis of ribosomal and actively translated mRNAs. Paradoxically, NusG helps Rho act on untranslated transcripts, including non-canonical antisense RNAs and those arising from translational stress; how NusG fulfills these disparate functions is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that NusG activates Rho by assisting helicase isomerization from an open-ring, RNA-loading state to a closed-ring, catalytically active translocase. A crystal structure of closed-ring Rho in complex with NusG reveals the physical basis for this activation and further explains how Rho is excluded from translationally competent RNAs. This study demonstrates how a universally conserved transcription factor acts to modulate the activity of a ring-shaped ATPase motor and establishes how the innate sequence bias of a termination factor can be modulated to silence pervasive, aberrant transcription.

Abstract: Summary
The chromatin regulator FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) is essential for ensuring stable gene expression by promoting transcription. In a genetic screen using Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified that FACT maintains cell identities and acts as a barrier for transcription factor-mediated cell fate reprogramming. Strikingly, FACT’s role as a barrier to cell fate conversion is conserved in humans as we show that FACT depletion enhances reprogramming of fibroblasts. Such activity is unexpected because FACT is known as a positive regulator of gene expression, and previously described reprogramming barriers typically repress gene expression. While FACT depletion in human fibroblasts results in decreased expression of many genes, a number of FACT-occupied genes, including reprogramming-promoting factors, show increased expression upon FACT depletion, suggesting a repressive function of FACT. Our findings identify FACT as a cellular reprogramming barrier in C. elegans and humans, revealing an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cell fate protection.

Abstract: Summary
Gene regulation requires selective targeting of DNA regulatory enhancers over megabase distances. Here we show that Evf2, a cloud-forming Dlx5/6 ultraconserved enhancer (UCE) lncRNA, simultaneously localizes to activated (Umad1, 1.6 Mb distant) and repressed (Akr1b8, 27 Mb distant) chr6 target genes, precisely regulating UCE-gene distances and cohesin binding in mouse embryonic forebrain GABAergic interneurons (INs). Transgene expression of Evf2 activates Lsm8 (12 Mb distant) but fails to repress Akr1b8, supporting trans activation and long-range cis repression. Through both short-range (Dlx6 antisense) and long-range (Akr1b8) repression, the Evf2-5′UCE links homeodomain and mevalonate pathway-regulated enhancers to IN diversity. The Evf2-3′ end is required for long-range activation but dispensable for RNA cloud localization, functionally dividing the RNA into 3′-activator and 5′UCE repressor and targeting regions. Together, these results support that Evf2 selectively regulates UCE interactions with multi-megabase distant genes through complex effects on chromosome topology, linking lncRNA-dependent topological and transcriptional control with interneuron diversity and seizure susceptibility.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells develop from a self-reactive, CD4-single positive (CD4SP) precursor cell pool. Thus, Treg-fated developing thymocytes are expected to possess the potential to generate pathogenic self-reactive cells. However, no such pathogenic conversion has been observed, indicating mechanisms of defense to prevent such a deleterious event. Here, we show that, after the initial developmental phase, the Nr4a family of nuclear receptors promotes the development of Treg cells by cooperating with other Treg cell developmental machineries, as well as by forming a reinforcing loop with Foxp3. Nr4a-deficient Treg-fated thymocytes survive and can elicit autoimmunity, highlighting their roles in elimination of developing Treg precursors that fail to complete their development. Our findings reveal that the defective development of Treg-fated thymocytes is a potential route for the generation of pathogenic self-reactive cells, which is normally suppressed by Nr4a factors at both developmental and cell death levels.

Abstract: Summary
Our comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing across 32 The Cancer Genome Atlas cancer types from 8,705 patients detects alternative splicing events and tumor variants by reanalyzing RNA and whole-exome sequencing data. Tumors have up to 30% more alternative splicing events than normal samples. Association analysis of somatic variants with alternative splicing events confirmed known trans associations with variants in SF3B1 and U2AF1 and identified additional trans-acting variants (e.g., TADA1, PPP2R1A). Many tumors have thousands of alternative splicing events not detectable in normal samples; on average, we identified ≈930 exon-exon junctions (“neojunctions”) in tumors not typically found in GTEx normals. From Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium data available for breast and ovarian tumor samples, we confirmed ≈1.7 neojunction- and ≈0.6 single nucleotide variant-derived peptides per tumor sample that are also predicted major histocompatibility complex-I binders (“putative neoantigens”).

Abstract: Atherosclerosis preferentially involves in prone area of low and disturbed blood flow while steady and high levels of laminar blood flow are relatively protected from atherosclerosis. Disturbed flow induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). ER stress is caused under stress that disturbs the processing and folding of proteins resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER and activation of the UPR. Prolonged or severe UPR leads to activate apoptotic signaling. Recent studies have indicated that disturbed flow significantly up-regulated p-ATF6α, p-IRE1α, and its target spliced XBP-1. However, the role of laminar flow in ER stress-mediated endothelial apoptosis has not been reported yet. The present study thus investigated the role of laminar flow in ER stress-dependent endothelial cell death. The results demonstrated that laminar flow protects ER stress-induced cleavage forms of PARP-1 and caspase-3. Also, laminar flow inhibits ER stress-induced p-eIF2α, ATF4, CHOP, spliced XBP-1, ATF6 and JNK pathway; these effects are abrogated by pharmacological inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin. Finally, nitric oxide affects thapsigargin-induced cell death in response to laminar flow but not UPR. Taken together, these findings indicate that laminar flow inhibits UPR and ER stress-induced endothelial cell death via PI3K/Akt pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Layering of neural circuits facilitates the separation of neurons with high spatial sensitivity from those that play integrative temporal roles. Although anatomical layers are readily identifiable in the brain, layering is not structurally obvious in the spinal cord. But computational studies of motor behaviors have led to the concept of layered processing in the spinal cord. It has been postulated that spinal V3 interneurons (INs) play multiple roles in locomotion, leading us to investigate whether they form layered microcircuits. Using patch-clamp recordings in combination with holographic glutamate uncaging, we demonstrate focal, layered modules, in which ventromedial V3 INs form synapses with one another and with ventrolateral V3 INs, which in turn form synapses with ipsilateral motoneurons. Motoneurons, in turn, provide recurrent excitatory, glutamatergic input to V3 INs. Thus, ventral V3 interneurons form layered microcircuits that could function to ensure well-timed, spatially specific movements.

Abstract: Summary
It is unknown how the dynamic binding of transcription factors (TFs) is molecularly linked to chromatin remodeling and transcription. Using single-molecule tracking (SMT), we show that the chromatin remodeler RSC speeds up the search process of the TF Ace1p for its response elements (REs) at the CUP1 promoter. We quantified smFISH mRNA data using a gene bursting model and demonstrated that RSC regulates transcription bursts of CUP1 only by modulating TF occupancy but does not affect initiation and elongation rates. We show by SMT that RSC binds to activated promoters transiently, and based on MNase-seq data, that RSC does not affect the nucleosomal occupancy at CUP1. Therefore, transient binding of Ace1p and rapid bursts of transcription at CUP1 may be dependent on short repetitive cycles of nucleosome mobilization. This type of regulation reduces the transcriptional noise and ensures a homogeneous response of the cell population to heavy metal stress.

Abstract: Summary
Retention of critical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal proteins needed to carry out diverse functions (e.g., protein synthesis and folding, lipid metabolism) is mediated through a carboxy-terminal ER retention sequence (ERS) and its interaction with KDEL receptors. Here, we demonstrate that depleting ER calcium causes mass departure of ERS-containing proteins from cells by overwhelming KDEL receptors. In addition, we provide evidence that KDELR2 and KDELR3, but not KDELR1, are unfolded protein response (UPR) genes upregulated as an adaptive response to counteract the loss of ERS-containing proteins, suggesting previously unknown isoform-specific functions of the KDEL receptors. Overall, our findings establish that decreases in ER calcium change the composition of the ER luminal proteome and secretome, which can impact cellular functions and cell viability. The redistribution of the ER proteome from inside the cell to the outside has implications for dissecting the complex relationship of ER homeostasis with diverse disease pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the tumor suppressor SPOP (speckle-type POZ protein) cause prostate, breast, and other solid tumors. SPOP is a substrate adaptor of the cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase and localizes to nuclear speckles. Although cancer-associated mutations in SPOP interfere with substrate recruitment to the ligase, mechanisms underlying assembly of SPOP with its substrates in liquid nuclear bodies and effects of SPOP mutations on assembly are poorly understood. Here, we show that substrates trigger phase separation of SPOP in vitro and co-localization in membraneless organelles in cells. Enzymatic activity correlates with cellular co-localization and in vitro mesoscale assembly formation. Disease-associated SPOP mutations that lead to the accumulation of proto-oncogenic proteins interfere with phase separation and co-localization in membraneless organelles, suggesting that substrate-directed phase separation of this E3 ligase underlies the regulation of ubiquitin-dependent proteostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Recruitment and activation of thermogenic adipocytes have received increasing attention as a strategy to improve systemic metabolic control. The analysis of brown and brite adipocytes is complicated by the complexity of adipose tissue biopsies. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of pure brown, brite, and white adipocyte transcriptomes. By combining mouse and human transcriptome data, we identify a gene signature that can classify brown and white adipocytes in mice and men. Using a machine-learning-based cell deconvolution approach, we develop an algorithm proficient in calculating the brown adipocyte content in complex human and mouse biopsies. Applying this algorithm, we can show in a human weight loss study that brown adipose tissue (BAT) content is associated with energy expenditure and the propensity to lose weight. This online available tool can be used for in-depth characterization of complex adipose tissue samples and may support the development of therapeutic strategies to increase energy expenditure in humans.

Abstract: Summary
DNA breaks are complex lesions that can be repaired either by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or by homologous recombination (HR). The decision between these two routes of DNA repair is a key point of the DNA damage response (DDR) that is controlled by DNA resection. The core machinery catalyzing the resection process is well established. However, little is known about the additional requirements of DNA resection over DNA structures with high complexity. Here, we found evidence that the human helicase PIF1 has a role in DNA resection, specifically for defined DNA regions, such as those prone to form G-quadruplexes. Indeed, PIF1 is recruited to the site of DNA damage and physically interacts with proteins involved in DNA resection, and its depletion causes DNA damage sensitivity and a reduction of HR efficiency. Moreover, G4 stabilization by itself hampers DNA resection, a phenomenon suppressed by PIF1 overexpression.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormalities of the endolysosomal and autophagy systems are found in Alzheimer’s disease, but it is not clear whether defects in these systems are a cause or consequence of degenerative processes in the disease. In human neuronal models of monogenic Alzheimer’s disease, APP and PSEN1 mutations disrupt lysosome function and autophagy, leading to impaired lysosomal proteolysis and defective autophagosome clearance. Processing of APP by γ-secretase is central to the pathogenic changes in the lysosome-autophagy system caused by PSEN1 and APP mutations: reducing production of C-terminal APP by inhibition of BACE1 rescued these phenotypes in both APP and PSEN1 mutant neurons, whereas inhibition of γ-secretase induced lysosomal and autophagic pathology in healthy neurons. Defects in lysosomes and autophagy due to PSEN1 mutations are rescued by CRISPR-knockout of APP. These data demonstrate a key role for proteolysis of the C-terminal of APP by γ-secretase in neuronal dysfunction in monogenic Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrient availability influences the production and degradation of materials that are required for cell growth and survival. Autophagy is a nutrient-regulated process that is used to degrade cytoplasmic materials and has been associated with human diseases. Solute transporters influence nutrient availability and sensing, yet we know little about how transporters influence autophagy. Here, we screen for solute transporters that are required for autophagy-dependent cell death and identify CG11665/hermes. We show that hermes is required for both autophagy during steroid-triggered salivary gland cell death and TNF-induced non-apoptotic eye cell death. hermes encodes a proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporter that preferentially transports pyruvate over lactate. mTOR signaling is elevated in hermes mutant cells, and decreased mTOR function suppresses the hermes salivary gland cell death phenotype. Hermes is most similar to human SLC16A11, a protein that was recently implicated in type 2 diabetes, thus providing a link between pyruvate, mTOR, autophagy, and possibly metabolic disorders.

Abstract: The rise of widespread antifungal resistance fuels the need to explore new classes of inhibitory molecules as potential novel inhibitors. Recently a plant natural product poacic acid (PA) was shown to inhibit β-1,3-glucan synthesis, and to have antifungal activity against a range of plant pathogens and against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As with the echinocandins, such as caspofungin, PA targets the synthesis of cell wall β-1,3-glucan and has potential utility in the treatment of medically important fungi. However, the antifungal activity of PA against human pathogenic Candida species has not been explored and the precise mode of action of this compound is not understood. Here, we show that PA sensitivity is regulated by the calcineurin pathway and that susceptibility to PA varied significantly between Candida species, but did not correlate with in vitro β-glucan synthase activity, cell wall β-glucan content or the sensitivity of the species to caspofungin. Strains with point mutations (S645Y or S645P) in the hotspot1 region of the β-1,3-glucan synthase subunit Fks1, had decreased sensitivity to caspofungin but increased sensitivity to PA. C. guilliermondii, C. orthopsilosis, and C. parapsilosis were more sensitive to PA than C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. tropicalis, and C. glabrata. These observations suggest that there are significant differences in the mode of action of PA and caspofungin and that PA or PA analogues are not likely to have broad spectrum activity in the treatment of Candida infections.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in human GRXCR2, which encodes a protein of undetermined function, cause hearing loss by unknown mechanisms. We found that mouse GRXCR2 localizes to the base of the stereocilia, which are actin-based mechanosensing organelles in cochlear hair cells that convert sound-induced vibrations into electrical signals. The stereocilia base also contains taperin, another protein of unknown function required for human hearing. We show that taperin and GRXCR2 form a complex and that taperin is diffused throughout the stereocilia length in Grxcr2-deficient hair cells. Stereocilia lacking GRXCR2 are longer than normal and disorganized due to the mislocalization of taperin, which could modulate the actin cytoskeleton in stereocilia. Remarkably, reducing taperin expression levels could rescue the morphological defects of stereocilia and restore the hearing of Grxcr2-deficient mice. Thus, our findings suggest that GRXCR2 is critical for the morphogenesis of stereocilia and auditory perception by restricting taperin to the stereocilia base.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular p53 protein levels are regulated by a ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination cycle that can target the protein for proteasomal destruction. The ubiquitination reaction is catalyzed by a multitude of ligases, whereas the removal of ubiquitin chains is mediated by two deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), USP7 (HAUSP) and USP10. Here, we show that PHD3 hydroxylates p53 at proline 359, a residue that is in the p53-DUB binding domain. Hydroxylation of p53 upon proline 359 regulates its interaction with USP7 and USP10, and its inhibition decreases the association of p53 with USP7/USP10, increases p53 ubiquitination, and rapidly reduces p53 protein levels independently of mRNA expression. Our results show that p53 is a PHD3 substrate and that hydroxylation by PHD3 regulates p53 protein stability through modulation of ubiquitination.

Abstract: Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) play an essential role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by promoting synovitis, pannus growth and cartilage/bone destruction. Increased proliferation, migration and invasion of FLSs greatly contribute to RA initiation and progression. Dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A), a serine/threonine kinase, regulates MAPK pathway activation, and governs the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells and cancer cells. Till now, the expression and possible function of Dyrk1A in RA FLSs have not been explored. In this study, we detected an increased expression of Dyrk1A both in the synovial tissues of RA patients and in a TNF-α-induced FLSs activation model. CCK-8 and Edu assays revealed that Dyrk1A knockdown inhibited TNF-α-induced FLSs proliferation. Moreover, inhibiting Dyrk1A expression apparently prevented the migration and invasion capability of FLSs accompanied by a decreased MMP-3 and -9 expression. To investigate the molecular mechanism through which Dyrk1A modulates FLSs activities, we evaluated the effects of Dyrk1A on Spry2, a negativity modulator of ERK MAPK pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that Dyrk1A silencing significantly increased Spry2 expression and suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK in TNF-α-treated FLSs. Taken together, our results indicated that Dyrk1A might promote FLSs proliferation, migration and invasion by suppressing Spry2 expression and activating the ERK MAPK signaling pathway in RA.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous classes of riboswitches have been found to regulate bacterial gene expression in response to physiological cues, offering new paths to antibacterial drugs. As common studies of isolated riboswitches lack the functional context of the transcription machinery, we here combine single-molecule, biochemical, and simulation approaches to investigate the coupling between co-transcriptional folding of the pseudoknot-structured preQ1 riboswitch and RNA polymerase (RNAP) pausing. We show that pausing at a site immediately downstream of the riboswitch requires a ligand-free pseudoknot in the nascent RNA, a precisely spaced sequence resembling the pause consensus, and electrostatic and steric interactions with the RNAP exit channel. While interactions with RNAP stabilize the native fold of the riboswitch, binding of the ligand signals RNAP release from the pause. Our results demonstrate that the nascent riboswitch and its ligand actively modulate the function of RNAP and vice versa, a paradigm likely to apply to other cellular RNA transcripts.

Abstract: Summary
A long-standing question in quantitative biology is the relationship between mRNA and protein levels of the same gene. Here, we measured mRNA and protein abundance, the phenotypic state, and the population context in thousands of single human cells for 23 genes by combining a unique collection of cell lines with fluorescently tagged endogenous genomic loci and quantitative immunofluorescence with branched DNA single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization and computer vision. mRNA and protein abundance displayed a mean single-cell correlation of 0.732 at steady state. Single-cell outliers of linear correlations are in a specific phenotypic state or population context. This is particularly relevant for interpreting mRNA-protein relationships during acute gene induction and turnover, revealing a specific adaptation of gene expression at multiple steps in single cells. Together, we show that single-cell protein abundance can be predicted by multivariate information that integrates mRNA level with the phenotypic state and microenvironment of a particular cell.

Abstract: Gerbillus tarabuli is a nocturnal seasonal breeder desert rodent with a main breeding season in spring and summer, and sexual quiescence in winter. This species is an interesting model for studying testis function in rodents. Therefore, the present study was performed firstly to investigate the stages of seminiferous epithelium cycle of Gerbillus tarabuli with a histological, morphometric and statistical study. And secondly to investigate the expression and possible variations in cellular distribution of RFamide-related peptide-3 (RFRP-3) - the mammalian ortholog of avian gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) - during seminiferous epithelium cycle using immunohistochimestry. Our results showed for the first time that the seminiferous epithelium cycle in Gerbillus tarabuli comprises 14 well-defined stages according to the tubular morphology method. The seminiferous epithelium thickness showed a significant difference during the epithelium cycle, thus it was the only morphometric classification criterion of seminiferous epithelium cycle in Gerbillus tarabuli. The immunohistochemical study reveals, for the first time, the presence of RFRP-3 in Gerbillus tarabuli testes, in both testicular compartments: the tubular and the interstitial. RFRP-3 is expressed differently according to the seminiferous epithelium cycle, RFRP-3 seemed to be more expressed at the stages V-VII and XIII. RFRP-3 was detected in Sertoli cells (≈12%), spermatocytes I (≈19%), round and elongated spermatids (≈13%), and with a more important signal in Leydig cells (26.87%±0.07). These results indicated the importance of RFRP-3 in testicular function in Gerbillus tarabuli; its expression at the interstitial and germinal levels argues in favor of an involvement in androgens synthesis and in spermatogenesis specifically in meiosis and spermiogenesis. This action seems primordial from stages V-VII and XIII. Also, the study of the seminiferous epithelium cycle will enrich the histological identity of the species.

Abstract: Summary
Neural network remodeling underpins the ability to remember life experiences, but little is known about the long-term plasticity of neural populations. To study how the brain encodes episodic events, we used time-lapse two-photon microscopy and a fluorescent reporter of neural plasticity based on an enhanced form of the synaptic activity-responsive element (E-SARE) within the Arc promoter to track thousands of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells over weeks in mice that repeatedly encountered different environments. Each environment evokes characteristic patterns of ensemble neural plasticity, but with each encounter, the set of activated cells gradually evolves. After repeated exposures, the plasticity patterns evoked by an individual environment progressively stabilize. Compared with young adults, plasticity patterns in aged mice are less specific to individual environments and less stable across repeat experiences. Long-term consolidation of hippocampal plasticity patterns may support long-term memory formation, whereas weaker consolidation in aged subjects might reflect declining memory function.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-fate decisions are central to the survival and development of both uni- and multicellular organisms. It remains unclear when and to what degree cells can decide on future fates prior to commitment. This uncertainty stems from experimental and theoretical limitations in measuring and integrating multiple signals at the single-cell level during a decision process. Here, we combine six-color live-cell imaging with the Bayesian method of statistical evidence to study the meiosis/quiescence decision in budding yeast. Integration of multiple upstream metabolic signals predicts individual cell fates with high probability well before commitment. Cells “decide” their fates before birth, well before the activation of pathways characteristic of downstream cell fates. This decision, which remains stable through several cell cycles, occurs when multiple metabolic parameters simultaneously cross cell-fate-specific thresholds. Taken together, our results show that cells can decide their future fates long before commitment mechanisms are activated.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, gene silencing by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) is a well-understood cytoplasmic posttranscriptional gene regulatory mechanism. Here, we show that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) contain high levels of nuclear AGO proteins and that in ESCs nuclear AGO protein activity allows for the onset of differentiation. In the nucleus, AGO proteins interact with core RISC components, including the TNRC6 proteins and the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. In contrast to cytoplasmic miRNA-mediated gene silencing that mainly operates on cis-acting elements in mRNA 3′ untranslated (UTR) sequences, in the nucleus AGO binding in the coding sequence and potentially introns also contributed to post-transcriptional gene silencing. Thus, nuclear localization of AGO proteins in specific cell types leads to a previously unappreciated expansion of the miRNA-regulated transcriptome.

Abstract: Summary
The mammary gland consists of cells with gene expression patterns reflecting their cellular origins, function, and spatiotemporal context. However, knowledge of developmental kinetics and mechanisms of lineage specification is lacking. We address this significant knowledge gap by generating a single-cell transcriptome atlas encompassing embryonic, postnatal, and adult mouse mammary development. From these data, we map the chronology of transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct cell states and distinguish fetal mammary stem cells (fMaSCs) from their precursors and progeny. fMaSCs show balanced co-expression of factors associated with discrete adult lineages and a metabolic gene signature that subsides during maturation but reemerges in some human breast cancers and metastases. These data provide a useful resource for illuminating mammary cell heterogeneity, the kinetics of differentiation, and developmental correlates of tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The ultimate goal of protein design is to introduce new biological activity. We propose a computational approach for designing functional antibodies by focusing on functional epitopes, integrating large-scale statistical analysis with multiple structural models. Machine learning is used to analyze these models and predict specific residue-residue contacts. We use this approach to design a functional antibody to counter the proinflammatory effect of the cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A). X-ray crystallography confirms that the designed antibody binds the targeted epitope and the interaction is mediated by the designed contacts. Cell-based assays confirm that the antibody is functional. Importantly, this approach does not rely on a high-quality 3D model of the designed complex or even a solved structure of the target. As demonstrated here, this approach can be used to design biologically active antibodies, removing some of the main hurdles in antibody design and in drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
When resources are abundant, many rod-shaped bacteria reproduce through precise, symmetric divisions. However, realistic environments entail fluctuations between restrictive and permissive growth conditions. Here, we use time-lapse microscopy to study the division of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus as illumination intensity varies. We find that dim conditions produce elongated cells whose divisions follow a simple rule: cells shorter than ∼8 μm divide symmetrically, but above this length divisions become asymmetric, typically producing a short ∼3-μm daughter. We show that this division strategy is implemented by the Min system, which generates multi-node patterns and traveling waves in longer cells that favor the production of a short daughter. Mathematical modeling reveals that the feedback loops that create oscillatory Min patterns are needed to implement these generalized cell division rules. Thus, the Min system, which enforces symmetric divisions in short cells, acts to strongly suppress mid-cell divisions when S. elongatus cells are long.

Abstract: Summary
Intrinsic apoptosis resulting from BAX/BAK-mediated mitochondrial membrane damage is regarded as immunologically silent. We show here that in macrophages, BAX/BAK activation results in inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein degradation to promote caspase-8-mediated activation of IL-1β. Furthermore, BAX/BAK signaling induces a parallel pathway to NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated caspase-1-dependent IL-1β maturation that requires potassium efflux. Remarkably, following BAX/BAK activation, the apoptotic executioner caspases, caspase-3 and -7, act upstream of both caspase-8 and NLRP3-induced IL-1β maturation and secretion. Conversely, the pyroptotic cell death effectors gasdermin D and gasdermin E are not essential for BAX/BAK-induced IL-1β release. These findings highlight that innate immune cells undergoing BAX/BAK-mediated apoptosis have the capacity to generate pro-inflammatory signals and provide an explanation as to why IL-1β activation is often associated with cellular stress, such as during chemotherapy.

Abstract: Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway and involves in the regulation of various cellular and developmental processes. Ligand binding releases the intracellular domain of Notch receptor (NICD), which interacts with DNA-bound CSL [CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1] to activate transcription of target genes. In the absence of NICD binding, CSL down-regulates target gene expression through the recruitment of various corepressor proteins including SMRT/NCoR (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors/nuclear receptor corepressor), SHARP (SMRT/HDAC1-associated repressor protein), and KyoT2. Structural and functional studies revealed the molecular basis of these interactions, in which NICD coactivator and corepressor proteins competitively bind to β-trefoil domain (BTD) of CSL using a conserved ϕWϕP motif (ϕ denotes any hydrophobic residues). To date, there are conflicting ideas regarding the molecular mechanism of SMRT-mediated repression of CSL as to whether CSL-SMRT interaction is direct or indirect (via the bridge factor SHARP). To solve this issue, we mapped the CSL-binding region of SMRT and employed a ‘one- plus two-hybrid system’ to obtain CSL interaction-defective mutants for this region. We identified the CSL-interaction module of SMRT (CIMS; amino acid 1816–1846) as the molecular determinant of its direct interaction with CSL. Notably, CIMS contains a canonical ϕWϕP sequence (APIWRP, amino acids 1832–1837) and directly interacts with CSL-BTD in a mode similar to other BTD-binding corepressors. Finally, we showed that CSL-interaction motif, rather than SHARP-interaction motif, of SMRT is involved in transcriptional repression of NICD in a cell-based assay. These results strongly suggest that SMRT participates in CSL-mediated repression via direct binding to CSL.

Abstract: Summary
Compared to noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as rRNAs and ribozymes, for which high-resolution structures abound, little is known about the tertiary structures of mRNAs. In eukaryotic cells, newly made mRNAs are packaged with proteins in highly compacted mRNA particles (mRNPs), but the manner of this mRNA compaction is unknown. Here, we developed and implemented RIPPLiT (RNA immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation in tandem), a transcriptome-wide method for probing the 3D conformations of RNAs stably associated with defined proteins, in this case, exon junction complex (EJC) core factors. EJCs multimerize with other mRNP components to form megadalton-sized complexes that protect large swaths of newly synthesized mRNAs from endonuclease digestion. Unlike ncRNPs, wherein strong locus-specific structures predominate, mRNPs behave more like flexible polymers. Polymer analysis of proximity ligation data for hundreds of mRNA species demonstrates that nascent and pre-translational mammalian mRNAs are compacted by their associated proteins into linear rod-like structures.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of HD provide an opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying disease pathology in disease-relevant patient tissues. Murine studies have demonstrated that HTT is intricately involved in corticogenesis. However, the effect of mutant Hungtintin (mtHTT) in human corticogenesis has not yet been thoroughly explored. This examination is critical, due to inherent differences in cortical development and timing between humans and mice. We therefore differentiated HD and non-diseased iPSCs into functional cortical neurons. While HD patient iPSCs can successfully differentiate toward a cortical fate in culture, the resulting neurons display altered transcriptomics, morphological and functional phenotypes indicative of altered corticogenesis in HD.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial function is important for aspartate biosynthesis in proliferating cells. Here, we show that mitochondrial aspartate export via the aspartate-glutamate carrier 1 (AGC1) supports cell proliferation and cellular redox homeostasis. Insufficient cytosolic aspartate delivery leads to cell death when TCA cycle carbon is reduced following glutamine withdrawal and/or glutaminase inhibition. Moreover, loss of AGC1 reduces allograft tumor growth that is further compromised by treatment with the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839. Together, these findings argue that mitochondrial aspartate export sustains cell survival in low-glutamine environments and AGC1 inhibition can synergize with glutaminase inhibition to limit tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
To understand brain circuits of cognitive behaviors under natural conditions, we developed techniques for imaging neuronal activities from large neuronal populations in the deep layer cortex of the naturally behaving common marmoset. Animals retrieved food pellets or climbed ladders as a miniature fluorescence microscope monitored hundreds of calcium indicator-expressing cortical neurons in the right primary motor cortex. This technique, which can be adapted to other brain regions, can deepen our understanding of brain circuits by facilitating longitudinal population analyses of neuronal representation associated with cognitive naturalistic behaviors and their pathophysiological processes.

Abstract: The present study is concerned with the expression and localization of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, nNOS, eNOS and iNOS in the epidermis and the gill epithelium of Chaca chaca by means of immunohistochemical techniques. nNOS immunoreactivity was observed in the outer layer epithelial cells of the epidermis, outer epithelium of gill filaments at their distal regions and in between the secondary lamellae. iNOS positive cells were observed at intervals in the epidermis from basal layer to superficial layer, in outer layers of epithelium of the gill filament and in epithelium of the secondary lamellae. The expression of eNOS is similar to that of iNOS in the gills. In addition, NOS activity was also observed in the taste buds in the epidermis. The expression of different NOS isoforms in C. chaca are associated to increase the adaptability and survivability of the fish in hypoxic condition, help in defence and ion regulation and sensory functions. The study could be useful to understand the expression of NOS isoforms in different fish tissues and their diverse role in relation to the physiology of the fish.

Abstract: Summary
We integrated the genomic sequencing of 1,918 breast cancers, including 1,501 hormone receptor-positive tumors, with detailed clinical information and treatment outcomes. In 692 tumors previously exposed to hormonal therapy, we identified an increased number of alterations in genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and in the estrogen receptor transcriptional machinery. Activating ERBB2 mutations and NF1 loss-of-function mutations were more than twice as common in endocrine resistant tumors. Alterations in other MAPK pathway genes (EGFR, KRAS, among others) and estrogen receptor transcriptional regulators (MYC, CTCF, FOXA1, and TBX3) were also enriched. Altogether, these alterations were present in 22% of tumors, mutually exclusive with ESR1 mutations, and associated with a shorter duration of response to subsequent hormonal therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous mechanisms to support cells under conditions of transient nutrient starvation have been described. Several functions of the tumor-suppressor protein p53 can contribute to the adaptation of cells to metabolic stress and help cancer cell survival under nutrient-limiting conditions. We show here that p53 promotes the expression of SLC1A3, an aspartate/glutamate transporter that allows the utilization of aspartate to support cells in the absence of extracellular glutamine. Under glutamine deprivation, SLC1A3 expression maintains electron transport chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, promoting de novo glutamate, glutamine, and nucleotide synthesis to rescue cell viability. Tumor cells with high levels of SLC1A3 expression are resistant to glutamine starvation, and SLC1A3 depletion retards the growth of these cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a therapeutic potential for SLC1A3 inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Remyelination is a multistep regenerative process that results in the reformation of myelin sheaths around demyelinated axons and is a critical therapeutic target. Here we show that immediate access to a running wheel following toxin-induced demyelination in mice enhances oligodendrogenesis, the rate of remyelination, and the proportion of remyelinated axons. RNA sequencing suggests broad activation of pro-remyelination pathways including phagocytosis by exercise and highlights peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-alpha (PGC1α) activation. By immunohistochemistry and cell type-specific conditional deletion, we confirmed PGC1α within oligodendrocytes as a transiently expressed factor required for the rate of myelin thickening by exercise. We validated the exercise-enhanced clearance of inhibitory lipid debris from lesions. Finally, exercise works in parallel with the remyelinating medication clemastine to produce complete remyelination of lesions. Our study demonstrates physical activity as an integrative means to enhance remyelination and details a multimodal mechanism including the pivotal PGC1α-dependent enhancement of myelin thickness.

Abstract: Summary
The connectivity principles underlying the emergence of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1) of mammals lacking an orientation map (such as rodents and lagomorphs) are poorly understood. We present a computational model in which random connectivity gives rise to orientation selectivity that matches experimental observations. The model predicts that mouse V1 neurons should exhibit intricate receptive fields in the two-dimensional frequency domain, causing a shift in orientation preferences with spatial frequency. We find evidence for these features in mouse V1 using calcium imaging and intracellular whole-cell recordings.

Abstract: Summary
A key step in sensory information processing involves modulation and integration of neuronal oscillations in disparate frequency bands, a poorly understood process. Here, we investigate how top-down input causes frequency changes in slow oscillations during sensory processing and, in turn, how the slow oscillations are combined with fast oscillations (which encode sensory input). Using experimental connectivity patterns and strengths of interneurons, we develop a system-level model of a neuronal circuit controlling these oscillatory behaviors, allowing us to understand the mechanisms responsible for the observed oscillatory behaviors. Our analysis discovers a circuit capable of producing the observed oscillatory behaviors and finds that a detailed balance in the strength of synaptic connections is the critical determinant to produce such oscillatory behaviors. We not only uncover how disparate frequency bands are modulated and combined but also give insights into the causes of abnormal neuronal activities present in brain disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Cell competition employs comparisons of fitness to selectively eliminate cells sensed as less healthy. In Drosophila, apoptotic elimination of the weaker “loser” cells from growing wing discs is induced by a signaling module consisting of the Toll ligand Spätzle (Spz), several Toll-related receptors, and NF-κB factors. How this module is activated and restricted to competing disc cells is unknown. Here, we use Myc-induced cell competition to demonstrate that loser cell elimination requires local wing disc synthesis of Spz. We identify Spz processing enzyme (SPE) and modular serine protease (ModSP) as activators of Spz-regulated competitive signaling and show that “winner” cells trigger elimination of nearby WT cells by boosting SPE production. Moreover, Spz requires both Toll and Toll-8 to induce apoptosis of wing disc cells. Thus, during cell competition, Spz-mediated signaling is strictly confined to the imaginal disc, allowing errors in tissue fitness to be corrected without compromising organismal physiology.

Abstract: Summary
PICH is a DNA translocase necessary for the resolution of ultrafine anaphase DNA bridges and to ensure the fidelity of chromosomal segregation. Here, we report the generation of an animal model deficient for PICH that allowed us to investigate its physiological relevance. Pich KO mice lose viability during embryonic development due to a global accumulation of DNA damage. However, despite the presence of chromosomal instability, extensive p53 activation, and increased apoptosis throughout the embryo, Pich KO embryos survive until day 12.5 of embryonic development. The absence of p53 failed to improve the viability of the Pich KO embryos, suggesting that the observed developmental defects are not solely due to p53-induced apoptosis. Moreover, Pich-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibit chromosomal instability and are resistant to RASV12/E1A-induced transformation. Overall, our data indicate that PICH is essential to preserve chromosomal integrity in rapidly proliferating cells and is therefore critical during embryonic development and tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are neurovascular lesions caused by mutations in one of three genes (CCM1–3). Loss of CCM3 causes the poorest prognosis, and little is known about how it regulates vascular integrity. The C. elegans ccm-3 gene regulates the development of biological tubes that resemble mammalian vasculature, and in a genome-wide reverse genetic screen, we identified more than 500 possible CCM-3 pathway genes. With a phenolog-like approach, we generated a human CCM signaling network and identified 29 genes in common, of which 14 are required for excretory canal extension and membrane integrity, similar to ccm-3. Notably, depletion of the MO25 ortholog mop-25.2 causes severe defects in tube integrity by preventing CCM-3 localization to apical membranes. Furthermore, loss of MO25 phenocopies CCM3 ablation by causing stress fiber formation in endothelial cells. This work deepens our understanding of how CCM3 regulates vascular integrity and may help identify therapeutic targets for treating CCM3 patients.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing (AS) is generally regulated by trans-splicing factors that specifically bind to cis-elements in pre-mRNAs. The human genome encodes ∼1,500 RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that potentially regulate AS, yet their functions remain largely unknown. To explore their potential activities, we fused the putative functional domains of RBPs to a sequence-specific RNA-binding domain and systemically analyzed how these engineered factors affect splicing. We discovered that ∼80% of low-complexity domains in endogenous RBPs displayed distinct context-dependent activities in regulating splicing, indicating that AS is under more extensive regulation than previously expected. We developed a machine learning approach to classify and predict the activities of RBPs based on their sequence compositions and further validated this model using endogenous RBPs and synthetic polypeptides. These results represent a systematic inspection, modeling, prediction, and validation of how RBP sequences affect their activities in controlling splicing, paving the way for de novo engineering of artificial splicing factors.

Abstract: Summary
BRCA1 functions in homologous recombination (HR) both up- and downstream of DNA end resection. However, in cells with 53BP1 gene knockout (KO), BRCA1 is dispensable for the initiation of resection, but whether BRCA1 activity is entirely redundant after end resection is unclear. Here, we found that 53bp1 KO rescued the embryonic viability of a Brca1ΔC/ΔC mouse model that harbors a stop codon in the coiled-coil domain. However, Brca1ΔC/ΔC;53bp1−/− mice were susceptible to tumor formation, lacked Rad51 foci, and were sensitive to PARP inhibitor (PARPi) treatment, indicative of suboptimal HR. Furthermore, BRCA1 mutant cancer cell lines were dependent on truncated BRCA1 proteins that retained the ability to interact with PALB2 for 53BP1 KO induced RAD51 foci and PARPi resistance. Our data suggest that the overall efficiency of 53BP1 loss of function induced HR may be BRCA1 mutation dependent. In the setting of 53BP1 KO, hypomorphic BRCA1 proteins are active downstream of end resection, promoting RAD51 loading and PARPi resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Cyanobacteria must balance separate demands for energy generation, carbon assimilation, and biomass synthesis. We used shotgun proteomics to investigate proteome allocation strategies in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as it adapted to light and inorganic carbon (Ci) limitation. When partitioning the proteome into seven functional sectors, we find that sector sizes change linearly with growth rate. The sector encompassing ribosomes is significantly smaller than in E. coli, which may explain the lower maximum growth rate in Synechocystis. Limitation of light dramatically affects multiple proteome sectors, whereas the effect of Ci limitation is weak. Carbon assimilation proteins respond more strongly to changes in light intensity than to Ci. A coarse-grained cell economy model generally explains proteome trends. However, deviations from model predictions suggest that the large proteome sectors for carbon and light assimilation are not optimally utilized under some growth conditions and may constrain the proteome space available to ribosomes.

Abstract: Summary
The NLRP3 inflammasome senses a range of cellular disturbances, although no consensus exists regarding a common mechanism. Canonical NLRP3 activation is blocked by high extracellular K+, regardless of the activating signal. We report here that canonical NLRP3 activation leads to Ca2+ flux and increased calpain activity. Activated calpain releases a pool of Caspase-1 sequestered by the cytoskeleton to regulate NLRP3 activation. Using electrophysiological recording, we found that resting-state eukaryotic membrane potential (MP) is required for this calpain activity, and depolarization by high extracellular K+ or artificial hyperpolarization results in the inhibition of calpain. Therefore, the MP/Ca2+/calpain/Caspase-1 axis acts as an independent regulatory mechanism for NLRP3 activity. This finding provides mechanistic insight into high K+-mediated inhibition of NLRP3 activation, and it offers an alternative model of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that does not involve K+ efflux.

Innate Immune Signals Induce Anterograde Endosome Transport Promoting MHC Class I Cross-Presentation,

Abstract: Summary
Both cross-presentation of antigens by dendritic cells, a key pathway triggering T cell immunity and immune tolerance, and survival of several pathogens residing in intracellular vacuoles are intimately linked to delayed maturation of vesicles containing internalized antigens and microbes. However, how early endosome or phagosome identity is maintained is incompletely understood. We show that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and Fc receptor ligation induces interaction of the GTPase Rab14 with the kinesin KIF16b mediating plus-end-directed microtubule transport of endosomes. As a result, Rab14 recruitment to phagosomes delays their maturation and killing of an internalized pathogen. Enhancing anterograde transport by overexpressing Rab14, promoting the GTP-bound Rab14 state, or inhibiting retrograde transport upregulates cross-presentation. Conversely, reducing Rab14 expression, destabilizing Rab14 endosomes, and inhibiting anterograde microtubule transport by Kif16b knockdown compromise cross-presentation. Therefore, regulation of early endosome trafficking by innate immune signals is a critical parameter in cross-presentation by dendritic cells.

Abstract: Summary
Metformin has been reported to possess antitumor activity and maintain high cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immune surveillance. However, the functions and detailed mechanisms of metformin’s role in cancer immunity are not fully understood. Here, we show that metformin increases CTL activity by reducing the stability and membrane localization of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Furthermore, we discover that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activated by metformin directly phosphorylates S195 of PD-L1. S195 phosphorylation induces abnormal PD-L1 glycosylation, resulting in its ER accumulation and ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Consistently, tumor tissues from metformin-treated breast cancer patients exhibit reduced PD-L1 levels with AMPK activation. Blocking the inhibitory signal of PD-L1 by metformin enhances CTL activity against cancer cells. Our findings identify a new regulatory mechanism of PD-L1 expression through the ERAD pathway and suggest that the metformin-CTLA4 blockade combination has the potential to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy.
