Abstract: Magnesium zinc oxide (MZO, MgxZn1-xO) is a leading emitter for CdTe-based solar cells due to its transparency and the ability to tune its conduction band offset with the absorber. Devices employing alloyed cadmium selenide telluride (CST, CdSeyTe1-y) absorbers achieved high efficiency (>19%) using MZO deposited by reactive sputtering over a broad composition range (3.68–3.92 eV, x: 0.20–0.35). Minimal differences in implied and measured open circuit voltage indicate that the contacts are well passivated and highly selective across the spectrum of MZO employed. Device performance insensitivity to MZO composition, which is not observed in CdTe devices, is attributed to the formation of an oxygenated interface layer. Se volatility creates a group VI deficiency at the interface that drives O migration from the MZO into the absorber. This introduces conductivity in the emitter not present in its as-deposited state, contributing to the exceptional performance observed. It is shown that the quality of device passivation depends on the oxidation state of the as-deposited MZO such that intelligent control and management of the reactive sputtering process is required.

Abstract: Background
The level of satisfaction of donors with the blood donation system is an important factor which influences their intent to return for future donation. A 25-item questionnaire on the satisfaction of blood donors has been recently proposed to assess the donor satisfaction with the service provided by a blood bank. The objective of this study was to present a proposal for application and interpretation of a BDSQ considering a sample of blood donors of a Brazilian blood bank.
Methods
A sample of 1019 blood donors at the Regional Hemotherapy Center of Franca, Brazil, answered the BDSQ. A top-box analysis was used to assess the associations between the variables characterizing the profiles of blood donors and their overall satisfaction with the service provided by the blood bank. We proposed the use of a performance-importance plot (PIP) for the interpretation of the 25 items of the BDSQ.
Results
Older donors are more likely to report lower overall satisfaction with the service provided by the blood bank. PIP allows us to classify the items of BDSQ into long- and short-term improvement opportunities as well as into motivational and hygiene factors. Motivational factors (i.e. attributes that promote overall satisfaction when present) tend to be associated with the treatment offered by the blood bank staff. Donors seem to give more importance to the interpersonal aspects than to the physical structure of the service and other aspects of convenience.
Conclusions
Top-box analysis and PIP proved to be efficient strategies to interpret the results of the BDSQ.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate the effectiveness of a home-based therapeutic exercise program on lower back pain and functionality of SCD patients.
Setting
A Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center, University of Campinas (HEMOCENTRO-UNICAMP).
Methods
This was a prospective study, with a three-month follow-up of SCD patients with lower back pain. The lumbar spine functionality was evaluated by questionnaires, trunk flexion and extension analyses by fiber-optic-electrogoniometry and measurements of muscle strength of trunk flexor and extensors. The Intervention Group (IG) comprised 18 volunteers, median age 44y (28–58) and the control group (CG) comprised 15 volunteers, median age 42y (19–58), who did not perform exercises. The protocol consisted of daily home-based exercises with two evaluations: at the beginning and end of a three-month program. In order to compare the groups at baseline, the Fisher´s exact test and Mann–Whitney test were used for categorical and numeric variables, respectively. The Wilcoxon test was used for related samples comparing numeric measures of each group over time with a 5% (p < 0.05) significance level.
Results
After the intervention, patients demonstrated a significant improvement, according to the Visual-Analog-Scale (VAS; p = 0.01), Rolland Morris Disability questionnaire (RMDQ; p < 0.01) and trunk flexion and extension muscle strength (p < 0.01). No significant differences were found for the Start-Back-Screening-Tool-Brazil (SBST) and in measures of trunk flexion and extension range-of-motion (RoM).
Conclusion
Results suggest that daily home-based exercises for a three-month period ameliorate pain and improve disability related to lower back pain and muscle strength.

Abstract: Composite materials based on aluminium fumarate (AF) and CaCl2 have been developed for the storage of energy from renewable and waste sources. Composite Salt-Porous Matrix (CSPM) was synthesized by impregnating aluminium fumarate MOF host matrix with various relative CaCl2 salt contents (25–60 wt%). The resulting CSPMs were fully characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 and H2O sorption isotherms at −196 and 25 °C, respectively, scanning electron microscopy and thermal analysis. The high surface area of the AF matrix (959 m2 g−1) drastically decreases upon the addition of salt, to about 50 m2 g−1. The heat storage performance of the composites was found to depend on the added amount of salt to the MOF matrix, with higher amounts of salt leading to better performance. The maximum water sorption capacity of 0.68 kgH2O kg−1, coupled with a high heat of water sorption (1840 kJ kg−1), makes these composites interesting when used at a rehydration level not exceeding CaCl2.4H2O to avoid any deliquescence and washing out of the salt. A kinetic study of the hydration demonstrated that salt deposition increases the water sorption rate in comparison with the host matrix. Moreover, the impact of salt deposition on the activation energy of dehydration of the host matrix was also determined by applying integral isoconversional methods.

Abstract: Introduction
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disease characterized by congenital malformations and bone marrow failure. One of the most common oral diseases in individuals with FA is periodontitis and adequate self-perception of periodontal status could contribute to its prevention and early detection.
Aim
To compare oral health self-perception, measured by a questionnaire, with the clinical oral condition of patients with FA.
Methods and Results
Fifty-six patients with FA, over 11 years of age, answered a questionnaire about dental history and self-reported oral health. Decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT), Visible Plaque Index (VPI) and Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) were measured. The median age of participants was 21 years (min 11, max 44), 31 (55%) were females and 25 (45%) males. Thirty-five (62.5%) participants rated their oral condition as satisfactory and 7 (12.5%) participants reported tooth mobility, 10 (17.9%) exposed roots and 21 (37.5%) gingival bleeding. Clinical examination detected average DMFT = 5.23, VPI = 31.36% and GBI = 33.77%. The gingival bleeding report was more frequent among individuals with higher GBI (p =  0.014). The DMFT was higher in those who had already undergone dental treatments (p =  0.031). There was an association between participants who presented dental caries and who rated their oral health as poor (p =  0.03). The question “Do your gums bleed easily?” had good accuracy in the evaluation of periodontal disease (p =  0.68).
Conclusion
Oral health self-perception of individuals with FA about gingival inflammation was associated with their gingival bleeding index.

Abstract: Introduction
Little attention is given to thrombosis associated with pediatric acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This study describes the thrombotic and hemorrhagic manifestations of APL in pediatric patients and evaluates their hemostasis, based on coagulation tests.
Methods
Inclusion criteria were age 0–18 years and APL diagnosis between April 2005 and November 2017. Patients who had received blood transfusion prior to coagulation tests were excluded. Baseline coagulation tests, hematologic counts, and hemorrhagic/thrombotic manifestations were evaluated.
Results
Median age was 10.7 years (1–15 years). The initial coagulation tests revealed a median Hgb of 8.3 g/dL (4.7–12.9 g/dL), median leucocyte count of 10.9 × 10⁹/L (1.1–95.8 × 10⁹/L), median platelet count of 31.8 × 10⁹/L (2.0–109.0 × 10⁹/L), median activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 31.7 s (23.0–50.4 s), median aPTT ratio of 1.0 (0.78–1.6), median thromboplastin time (PT) of 17.5 s (13.8–27.7 s), median PT activity of 62% (25–95 %), and median fibrinogen of 157.7 mg/dL (60.0–281.0 mg/dL). Three patients (13%) had thrombosis. At diagnosis, 21 patients (91.3%) had bruising, one patient (4.3%) had splenic vein and artery thrombosis and one patient (4.3%) presented without thrombohemorrhagic manifestations. During treatment, two patients (8.6%) had thrombosis.
Conclusion
Knowledge of thrombosis in pediatric APL is important to determine its risk factors and the best way to treat and prevent this complication.

Abstract: Introduction
Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a Mendelian disorder with a heterogeneous clinical course. The reasons for this phenotypic diversity are not entirely established, but it is known that high fetal hemoglobin levels lead to a milder course of the disease. Additionally, genetic variants in the intergenic region HBS1L-MYB promote high levels of fetal hemoglobin into adulthood.
Objective
In the present study, we investigated the HMIP1 C-839A (rs9376092) polymorphism, located at the HBS1L-MYB intergenic region block 1, in SCA patients.
Method
We analyzed 299 SCA patients followed in two reference centers in Brazil. The HMIP1 C-839A (rs9376092) genotypes were determined by allele specific polymerase chain reactions. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from patient interviews and medical records.
Results
The median fetal hemoglobin levels were higher in patients with the HMIP1 C-839A (rs9376092) AA genotype (CC=6.4%, CA=5.6% and AA=8.6%), but this difference did not reach significance (p=0.194). No association between HMIP1 C-839A (rs9376092) genotypes and other clinical and laboratorial features was detected (p>0.05).
Conclusion
In summary, our data could not support the previously related association between the HMIP1 C-893A (rs9376092) polymorphism and differential fetal hemoglobin levels.

Abstract: Introduction
Mutations affecting genes involved in oxidative and signaling pathways may be associated with kidney disease in sickle cell anemia. We determined the allele and genotype frequencies of some polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the Heme Oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) [rs2071746 (A>T) and (GT)n repeats, short (S) and long (L) alleles] and Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor type-1B (BMPR1B) [rs17022863 (A>G), rs4331783 (A>G) and rs1470409 (A>G)] genes in 75 adult patients with sickle cell anemia and 160 healthy controls and investigated whether these polymorphisms may influence the estimated glomerular filtration rate for the patients.
Methods
The single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped using the TaqMan assays, the HMOX1(GT)n repeats were determined by polymerase chain reaction fragment size analysis and the estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.
Results
Regarding the HMOX1rs2071746, the estimated glomerular filtration rate median was significantly higher in TT patients (p=0.019), including when TT was compared with AT+AA (p=0.009); for the (GT)n repeats, the estimated glomerular filtration rate medians of SS, SL and LL significantly differed (p=0.009), being the LL estimated glomerular filtration rate median significantly higher, when compared with the LS+SS (p=0.005). These results suggest that both the homozygotes, TT for rs2071746 and LL for (GT)n repeats, lead to a higher risk of developing renal complications. Concerning the BMPR1B, the frequencies of GG for rs17022863 and AA for rs4331783 were significantly higher in patients than in controls (p=0.002 and p=0.008, respectively), however no association with estimated glomerular filtration rate was found.
Conclusion
These results contribute to a better understanding of the genetic factors related to the development of nephropathy in sickle cell anemia patients.

Abstract: Background
Transfusion of ABO-compatible non-identical platelets (PTLs), fresh plasma (FP) and red blood cells (RBCs) has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality of recipients. Trauma victims are frequently exposed to ABO non-identical products, given the need for emergency transfusions. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of the transfusion of ABO non-identical blood products on the severity and all-cause 30-day mortality of trauma patients.
Methods
This was a retrospective single-center cohort, which included trauma patients who received emergency transfusions in the first 24 h of hospitalization. Patients were divided in two groups according to the use of <3 or ≥3 ABO non-identical blood products. The patient severity, measured by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHEII) score at ICU admission, and the 30-day mortality were compared between groups.
Results
Two hundred and sixteen trauma patients were enrolled. Of these, 21.3% received ≥3 ABO non-identical blood products (RBCs, PLTs and FP or cryoprecipitate). The transfusion of ≥3 ABO non-identical blood products in the first 24 h of hospitalization was independently associated with a higher APACHEII score at ICU admission (OR = 3.28 and CI95% = 1.48–7.16). Transfusion of at least one unit of ABO non-identical PTLs was also associated with severity (OR = 10.89 and CI95% = 3.38–38.49). Transfusion of ABO non-identical blood products was not associated with a higher 30-day mortality in the studied cohort.
Conclusion
The transfusion of ABO non-identical blood products and, especially, of ABO non-identical PLTs may be associated with the greater severity of trauma patients at ICU admission. The transfusion of ABO non-identical blood products in the trauma setting is not without risks.

Abstract: The recent trend of some countries opting to ban the sale of new gasoline and diesel vehicles has led to an increase in the use of electric vehicles and automated driving. In an automobile, windows are the largest source of heat energy between the interior and exterior of the vehicle. By modulating the window material, we can precisely control the amount of heat from sunlight that is allowed to enter the car, reduce the load on heating and cooling. Thus, suppress the energy loss associated with air conditioning by introducing technology to control heat energy in windows, which can also help reduce electricity costs. To this end, our research group has been developing complementary electrochromic devices (ECDs) using Prussian blue and tungsten oxide, which consist of nanoparticles dispersed in aqueous solvents to make inks. Spin coating is used for film deposition at the laboratory level; however, it has a major limitation in terms of uniformity. Therefore, in this study, we fabricated functional thin films by using these inks with slit coating, which is a commercial process. The results obtained confirm that slit coating can be used to deposit approximately 1-μm-thick films as fast as within 20 s and even on large G2 size substrates; further, the uniformity of the films measured based on chromaticity and haze is high. In addition, this effect improves the response time of the ECD. As a future direction, this can be applied to flexible ECD, etc.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Protein S (PS; encoded by the PROS1 gene), a key vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant protein, is emerging as a key structural and functional protein that is overexpressd in various malignancies, but how PS signals to promote lung cancer progression is unclear.
Methods
We used immortalized, nontumorigenic human lung epithelial cell line NL-20, A549 cells as experimental cellular models for lung cancer, and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) as a model system for angiogenesis. A loss- and gain-of-function approach was then used to analyze the role of tumor-derived PS and their natural TAM receptors Tyro3 and MerTK in regulating cell proliferation, migration, anchorage-independent growth, and capillary-like tube formation, all prominent attributes of the metastatic phenotype of tumor cells.
Results
Evidence is now provided that regulation of PROS1 gene expression using either stable cell lines expressing lentiviral-short hairpin RNA (shRNAs) or a replication-incompetent adenovirus alters the phosphorylation of several major signaling pathways, including Erk, PKB/Akt, p38, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and modulates PS-dependent Tyro3- and MerTK-mediated cell migration, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer cells, and endothelial cell capillary-like tube formation.
Conclusion
These finding suggest that the PS-Tyro3 and -MerTK axis mediates important signaling pathways to promote lung cancer progression. Genetic inhibition of endogenous PS may serve as a promising target for anticancer drug development.

Abstract: Stacks consisting of an ultrathin SiO2 coated with atomic-layer deposited (ALD) zinc oxide (ZnO) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) have been shown to yield state-of-the-art passivation of n-type crystalline silicon surfaces. The distinguishing aspect of this novel passivation stack is the very conductive nature of the passivating ZnO layer. In this work, it is demonstrated that such a stack can provide additional functionalities relevant for silicon solar cells. Specifically, it is shown that the conductive and transparent stacks can passivate textured and n+-diffused silicon surfaces and that they can form an Ohmic contact to n+ -diffused surfaces with a low contact resistivity, provided the ZnO is Al-doped. The Al2O3 capping layer has previously been shown to be crucial in the passivation mechanism by preventing the effusion of hydrogen during annealing. Here, it is demonstrated to enable a significant improvement in both the transparency and lateral conductivity of the ZnO upon annealing as well, up to a level typically only attainable by In-based transparent conductive oxides. It is furthermore shown that the passivation of the stacks is thermally stable up to 500–600 oC, depending on the preparation method for the interfacial SiO2. Together, these properties make the presented stack an interesting building block for crystalline silicon solar cells, with possibilities for integration as passivating front contact in Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC)-like solar cells, e.g. as bottom cell top contact in silicon-perovskite tandem cells, as well as a conductive hydrogenation source for poly-Si passivating contacts.

Abstract: Some of the early complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) concerning the small vessels can be summarized as transplant-associated systemic vasculopathies (TASV). One enzyme known to play a major role in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and repair processes as well as tumor metastasis is heparanase (HPSE). HPSE genetic variants have recently been associated with significant influence on the risk of developing certain TASV such as a sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. This study aimed to validate the two known HPSE single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)—rs4693608 and rs4364254—as a genetic predictor of TASV in a cohort of 494 patients and were correlated retrospectively with the clinical course post-HSCT. Significant association was revealed for rs4364254, showing that the incidence of TASV (38.0% vs. 57.8%, p = .009) and in particular of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) (36.3% vs. 54.0%, p = .0138) was lower in wildtype CC carriers than in TC/TT carriers. Moreover, compared with all other genotypes, the allelic combination GG-CC had the lowest incidence of TASV (34.9% vs. 57.4%, p = .0109) and aGvHD in particular (34.9% vs. 53.5%, p = .0315). A competing risk regression analysis confirmed a significantly reduced risk for a TASV in patients with GG (subhazard ratio [SHR] = 0.670, p = .043) and CC (SHR = 0.598, p = .041) compared with the corresponding homozygote SNP as well as for allelic combinations correlated with low HPSE gene expression (SHR = 0.630, p = .016) and in correlation with clinical risk factors. In summary, our study emphasizes an association of HPSE gene SNPs with TASV, in particular with aGvHD, which could be implementable as pre-transplant risk stratification if validated prospectively.

Abstract: After colonization of the mosquito midgut by the malaria parasite, Plasmodium differentiates from an invasive, motile ookinete to a multiplicative, sessile oocyst. Despite their importance in establishing the infection and increasing its population, relatively little is known about the early morphological transformation associated with these changes in function. Oocyst differentiation begins with the formation of a spherical protrusion near the center of the crescent-shaped ookinete. As this protuberance grows, it engulfs the content of the two distal ends, thus rounding the cell. In this work, scrutinized observations of the overall changes in shape, coupled with the migration of the malaria pigment granules and the nucleus into the protuberance, revealed that the movement of the cell content happens in an anteroposterior manner. The resulting data, formalized as morphometric measurements, led to the identification of 5 transitional stages and to the development of a computer training algorithm that automatically classifies them. Since cell differentiation has been associated with redox fluctuations, the classification algorithm was tested with parasites stained with a glutathione-specific fluorescent probe. This revealed changes in the glutathione content during differentiation that are suggestive of a redox modulation during transformation.

Abstract: Introduction
Transfusion in cirrhotic patients remains a challenge due to the absence of evidence-based guidelines. Our study aimed to determine the indication of transfusion and the associated transfusion thresholds in cirrhotic patients.
Methods
This retrospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Transfusion Medicine at a tertiary care liver center from October 2018 to March 2019. The blood bank and patient records of cirrhotic patients admitted during the study period were retrieved and analyzed to determine the current transfusion practice.
Results
A total of 992 cirrhotic patients were included in the study. Blood components were transfused to 402 (40.5%) patients. Sixty-nine (17.2%) patients were transfused to control/treat active bleeding, while 333 (82.8%) were transfused prophylactically. Packed red blood cells (65.4%) was the most commonly transfused blood component, followed by fresh frozen plasma (35.6%), among patients receiving transfusions (therapeutic & prophylactic). The mean pre-transfusion thresholds for: (i) packed red blood cell transfusion: hemoglobin less than 7g/dL; (ii) fresh frozen plasma transfusion: international normalized ratio over 2.6; (iii) platelet concentrate transfusion: platelet count less than 40,700/μL, and; (iv) cryoprecipitate transfusion: fibrinogen less than 110mg/dL. The average length of stay of the study population was 5 days (3–9).
Conclusion
To conclude, 40.5% of our hospitalized cirrhotic patients were transfused, with the majority of the transfusions being prophylactic (82.8%). Separate guidelines are required for this patient population, as these patients have an altered hemostasis which responds differently to the transfusion of blood components.

Abstract: Introduction
Congenital fibrinogen disorders are characterized by heterogeneous clinical manifestations with mutations in the fibrinogen gene cluster. We aimed to describe the molecular genetics and clinical manifestations of fibrinogen abnormalities and perform genotype-phenotype correlations.
Materials and methods
Genetic analysis of fibrinogen genes was performed by direct sequencing. The effect of the specific missense variants on fibrinogen structure and function was analyzed using PROVEAN and PolyPhen-2 algorithms and was predicted by protein modeling.
Results
Thirteen mutations, including five novel mutations, were identified in the three fibrinogen genes. There was poor correlation between genotypes and phenotypes. All but one of the novel mutations in subjects were predicted to be deleterious. Protein modeling predicted that multiple ienteractions with surrounding residues for novel variants were likely to result in congenital fibrinogen disorders.
Conclusion
This study in a relatively large cohort of Chinese patients with congenital fibrinogen disorders enabled the identification of five new fibrinogen missense mutations. In silico modeling may represent a valuable tool for understanding amino acid residues from novel variants leading to congenital fibrinogen disorders, but it should be followed by functional studies. Clinical presentation of fibrinogen disorders was variable, possibly due to genetic and environmental modifiers.

Abstract: There have been significant improvements in therapeutic options for relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) over the past two decades, with many novel agents including proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents, and more recently monoclonal antibodies demonstrating efficacy in this setting. However, there is a paucity of real-world data comparing outcomes seen in patients treated with novel agents as opposed to older agents. We report a historical single center cohort of patients diagnosed with myeloma between the years 1991–2012 in order to explore possible differences in outcomes. A total of 139 patients who underwent stem cell transplantation were included in our study. In our study, 88 patients were treated with cyclophosphamide and steroids alone at relapse whereas 51 patients were treated with Len-Dex. In the multivariate analysis, TTNT was shorter for patients who received Cyclo compared to Len-Dex (HR=1.74; 95% CI, 1.01–2.99; p=0.04); however, we could not detect an overall survival benefit (HR=1.20; 95% CI 0.63–2.29; p=0.57). Adverse event rates were similar in the two groups. In this retrospective single center analysis, Len-Dex was associated with longer TTNT compared with Cyclo at first relapse following autoSCT in MM; however its effect on overall survival in this setting was less clear.

Abstract: Background
Liver cancer triggers a considerable number of global deaths. This work focused on mechanisms as well as impacts of ABAT in liver cancer.
Methods
Differentially expressed mRNAs in liver cancer were analyzed with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to determine and evaluate the prognostic significance of the target gene ABAT. ABAT was overexpressed to explore its effect on liver cancer. Furthermore, the targeted regulation between miR-183-5p and ABAT was verified through dual-luciferase method. The effects of their expression on liver cancer functions were detected by cell functional experiments like Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), Transwell and flow cytometry. Lastly, the inhibitory effect of ABAT on the tumor was proved in nude mice in vivo.
Results
At tissue and cell levels, ABAT was inactivated in liver cancer, and liver cancer patients with lowly expressed ABAT had poor prognosis. Overexpressing ABAT could inhibit cancer cell behaviors, and suppress tumorigenesis in nude mice. Meanwhile, overexpressed ABAT could upregulate E-cadherin in liver cancer cells, while downregulate MMP-9, Vimentin, MMP-2, N-cadherin, Ki67. Of note, miR-183-5p was highly expressed in liver cancer tissue and cells, which could target and downregulate ABAT expression. It was indicated by rescue assay that lowly expressed miR-183-5p could repress functions of liver cancer cells, while such inhibitory effect could be recovered by ABAT silencing.
Conclusion
Downstream of miR-183-5p, ABAT was targeted to mediate progression of liver cancer.

Abstract: In this work, a series of novel multi-energy driven composite phase change materials (PCMs) were fabricated with paraffin wax (PW) as PCM, poly(styrene-b-ethylene-co-butylene-b-styrene) (SEBS) as the thickening agent, and reduced graphene oxide aerogel (rGOA) as multi-energy capture agent and support material. When the mass fraction of SEBS is in the range of 5 wt%-15 wt%, the composite PCMs can be formed as form-stable PCMs (FSPCMs) by the physical reaction. The enthalpy value of PW/SEBS5/rGOA is measured as high as 226 J/g. The prepared FSPCMs show a good thermal reliability due to little reduction of enthalpy value after 200 accelerate cycles. And the prepared FSPCMs present a good thermal stability according to the thermogravimetric analysis. The thermal conductivity results show that rGOA slightly improves the thermal conductivity of the FSPCMs. Moreover, the prepared FSPCMs show excellent photo-thermal and electro-thermal conversion performance with the help of rGOA which can harvest the photons and electrons. As a result, the PW/SEBS/rGOA PCMs have great promise in areas such as solar/electrical energy collection, thermal energy storage, and thermal management.

Abstract: Background
Ten years after their availability, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA) have heralded a paradigm shift in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This study was aimed to analyze the implementation of current recommendations in the standard practice of adult ITP patients, and how age may influence those changes.
Methods
We included 121 adult patients (> 65 years, n = 54; younger individuals, n = 67) who initiated treatment with TPO-RA between January 2012 and December 2014.
Results
Patients older than 65 years treated with TPO-RA presented at diagnosis with significantly higher platelet counts, less bleeding, and a more prothrombotic profile than younger ones. The high efficacy rates of TPO-RA, preferentially used during the last decade in non-chronic phases, precluded from further therapies in the majority of ITP patients. Their administration was associated with a sharp decline in the last decade in the use of splenectomy and intravenous immunoglobulin, especially in younger ITP individuals.
Conclusion
These results confirm (1) that there is a preferential use of TPO-RAs in elderly ITP patients with fewer bleeding complications but more unfavorable prothrombotic conditions than in younger individuals, and (2) that early use of these agents has been established as an effective therapeutic alternative to other second line therapies.

Abstract: In a recent clinical trial, the metabolite l-glutamine was shown to reduce painful crises in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. To support this observation and identify other metabolites implicated in SCD clinical heterogeneity, we profiled 129 metabolites in the plasma of 705 SCD patients. We tested correlations between metabolite levels and six SCD-related complications (painful crises, cholecystectomy, retinopathy, leg ulcer, priapism, aseptic necrosis) or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and used Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess causality. We found a potential causal relationship between l-glutamine levels and painful crises (N = 1278, odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval] = 0.68 [0.52–0.89], P = 0.0048). In two smaller SCD cohorts (N = 299 and 406), the protective effect of l-glutamine was observed (OR = 0.82 [0.50–1.34]), although the MR result was not significant (P = 0.44). We identified 66 significant correlations between the levels of other metabolites and SCD-related complications or eGFR. We tested these correlations for causality using MR analyses and found no significant causal relationship. The baseline levels of quinolinic acid were associated with prospectively ascertained survival in SCD patients, and this effect was dependent on eGFR. Metabolomics provide a promising approach to prioritize small molecules that may serve as biomarkers or drug targets in SCD.

Abstract: While red blood cells (RBCs) and granulocytes have been more studied, platelets and reticulocytes are not commonly used in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) flow-cytometry and less is known about susceptibility to complement-mediated destruction and effects of anti-complement therapy on these populations. We performed flow-cytometry of RBCs and granulocytes in 90 PNH patients and of platelets and reticulocytes in a subgroup (N = 36), to unveil perturbations of these populations during PNH disease course before and after anti-complement treatment. We found that platelets and reticulocytes were less sensitive to complement-mediated lysis than RBCs but not as resistant as granulocytes, as shown by mean sensitive fraction (difference in a given PNH population vs. PNH granulocyte clone size). In treated patients, reticulocytes, platelets, RBCs (with differences between type II and III) and granulocytes significantly increased post-treatment, confirming the role of PNH hematopoiesis within the context of anti-complement therapy. Moreover, we found that PNH platelet clone size reflects PNH granulocyte clone size. Finally, we established correlations between sensitive fraction of PNH cell-types and thrombosis. In sum, we applied a flow-cytometry panel for investigation of PNH peripheral blood populations' perturbations before and after eculizumab treatment to explore complement-sensitivity and kinetics of these cells during the disease course.

Abstract: Reepithelialisation is fundamental to wound healing, but our current understanding largely relies on cellular and animal studies. The aim of the present randomised double-blind three-arm controlled trial was to correlate genuine epidermal wound healing with key proteins and topical zinc treatment in humans. Sixty wounds were produced using deroofed suction blisters in 30 healthy volunteers and randomised to topical zinc sulphate (n = 20), placebo (n = 20), or control (n = 20) treatment for 4 days. All wounds with perilesional skin were processed for automatic immunostaining of paraffin tissue sections with monoclonal antibodies against Ki-67, metallothionein (MT) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1. Protein expression was quantified by automated digital image analysis. Epidermal Ki-67 and MT labelling indices were increased in keratinocytes in the neoepidermis (∼1.1 mm) and at the wound edge (0.5 mm) compared to normal skin. Increased MMP-1 immunostaining was restricted to the neoepidermis. MT was robustly upregulated in the upper dermis of the wounds. Zinc treatment enhanced MMP-1 expression beneath the neoepidermis via paracrine mechanisms and MT under the neoepidermis and in the nonepithelialised wound bed via direct actions of zinc as indicated by the induction of MT2A mRNA but not MMP-1 mRNA in cultured normal human dermal fibroblasts by zinc sulphate. The present human study demonstrates that quantitative immunohistochemistry can identify proteins involved in reepithelialisation and actions of external compounds. Increased dermal MT expression may contribute to the anti-inflammatory activities of zinc and increased MMP-1 levels to promote keratinocyte migration.

Abstract: Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease characterized by extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and chondrocyte apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PRMT1 in TMJOA pathogenesis and its underlying molecular mechanism. Compared to the control group, PRMT1 was highly expressed in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes and articular cartilage following MIA injection into rat TMJs. Furthermore, knocking down PRMT1 considerably inhibited ECM degradation and apoptosis induced by IL-1β. Mechanistic analyses further revealed that PRMT1 knockdown activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and prevented FOXO1 from translocating to the nucleus. Moreover, an inhibitor of AKT (LY294002) rescued the effect of PRMT1 knockdown on IL-1β-induced ECM degradation and apoptosis, and AMI-1, a selective inhibitor of PRMT1, inhibited PRMT1 expression and reversed the pathological progress of TMJOA. Thus, our findings suggest that PRMT1 plays an essential role in ECM degradation and chondrocyte apoptosis in TMJOA via the AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Background
Transfusion of platelets (PLTs) with high ABO antibody titres can pose a risk of hemolysis if the unit crosses the ABO type. The PLTs stored in the platelet additive solution (PAS) remove asubstantial fraction of plasma and replace it with an isotonicbuffered solution.We aimed to assess the difference in anti-A/B antibody levels in Groups O, A and B apheresis platelets (APs) suspended in plasma and PAS.
Methodology
Apheresis donors are categorized into two groups, Plasma (Group I) and PAS (Group II), each blood group (A, B and O) had 20 samples. The anti-A/B(IgM)antibody levels were recorded from the AP donor (Group II) and from the AP units for both groups. The reduction in the anti-A/B(IgM) antibody levels in the APs suspended in the PAS for each blood group was determined.
Results
The median anti-A titres in blood Groups B (p = 0.009) and O (p = 0.005) was significantly lower in Group II. However, the difference in anti-B levels was not significant in the blood groups A (p = 0.057) and O (p = 0.205). The median level of reduction in IgM antibody titres across donor samples and the PAS-stored platelets was two-fold. The regression showed a level of reduction in antibody titres which can be explained by baseline donor antibody titres in blood groups A and B compared to blood group O.
Conclusion
The medianABO antibody titres were lower in APs suspended in PAS than in plasma. Addition of the PAS significantly lowered the IgM antibody titres by twofold, compared to plasma.

Abstract: Kesterite quaternary material Cu2ZnSnS4, (CZTS)-based thin-film solar cells have attracted intensive attention owing to their earth-abundant nature, stable thermodynamic structure, and large potential for high power conversion efficiency (PCE) defined by their suitable optoelectronic properties. As a widely used thin film preparation method, pulsed laser deposition (PLD) has not been fully studied in CZTS thin-film solar cell. Herein, a promising route based on PLD from a quaternary target and post-sulphuration for CZTS thin film was achieved. Through systematical investigation and optimization of substrate temperature, laser pulse energy, and sulfurization temperature, the CZTS thin films showed single kesterite structure, high (112) orientation, and dense polycrystalline grains with controlled composition. The CZTS thin-film solar cell exhibited a record PCE of 6.62%, the highest reported value when using pulsed laser deposited and sulfurized process, due to its lower series resistance, reduced grain boundary effects, superior interface quality, and a suitable depletion width. This research offers a facile and robust preparation method for CZTS films with enhanced photovoltaic properties and increased efficiency.

Abstract: We use temperature-dependent contact resistivity (ρc) measurements to systematically assess the dominant electron transport mechanism in a large set of poly-Si passivating contacts, fabricated by varying (i) the annealing temperature (Tann), (ii) the oxide thickness (tox), (iii) the oxidation method, and (iv) the surface morphology of the Si substrate. The results show that for silicon oxide thicknesses of 1.3–1.5 nm, the dominant transport mechanism changes from tunneling to drift-diffusion via pinholes in the SiOx layer for increasing Tann. This transition occurs for Tann in the range of 850°C-950 °C for a 1.5 nm thick thermal oxide, and 700°C-750 °C for a 1.3 nm thick wet-chemical oxide, which suggests that pinholes appear in wet-chemical oxides after exposure to lower thermal budgets compared to thermal oxides. For SiOx with tox = 2 nm, grown either thermally or by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition, carrier transport is pinhole-dominant for Tann = 1050 °C, whereas no electric current through the SiOx layer could be detected for lower Tann. Remarkably, the dominant transport mechanism is not affected by the substrate surface morphology, although lower values of ρc were measured on textured wafers compared to planar surfaces. Lifetime measurements suggest that the best carrier selectivity can be achieved by choosing Tann right above the transition range, but not too high, in order to induce pinhole dominant transport while preserving a good passivation quality.

SMAR1 suppresses the cancer stem cell population via hTERT repression in colorectal cancer cells,

Abstract: One of the hallmarks of a cancer cell is the ability for indefinite proliferation leading to the immortalization of the cell. Activation of several signaling pathways leads to the immortalization of cancer cells via the reactivation of enzyme telomerase (hTERT). hTERT is active in germ cells, stem cells and also cancer cells. An earlier report from our lab suggests that SMAR1, a tumor suppressor protein, is significantly downregulated in the higher grades of colorectal cancers. Our study identifies SMAR1 as a transcriptional repressor of hTERT. We find that SMAR1 interacts with HDAC1/mSin3a co-repressor complex at the hTERT promoter and brings about HDAC1-mediated transcriptional repression of the promoter. Most solid tumors including colorectal cancer reactivate hTERT expression as it confers several advantages to the cancer cells like increased proliferation and angiogenesis. One of these non-canonical functions of hTERT is inducing the pool of cancer stem cell population. We find that in the CD133HighCD44High cancer stem cells population, SMAR1 expression is highly diminished leading to elevated hTERT expression. We also find that knockdown of SMAR1 promotes total CD133+CD44+ population and impart enhanced sphere-forming ability to the colorectal cancer cells. SMAR1 also inhibits invasion and metastasis in colorectal cancer cell lines via repression of hTERT. Our study provides evidence that downregulation of SMAR1 causes activation of hTERT leading to an increase in the cancer stem cell phenotype in colorectal cancer cells.

Despite the success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aNHL), some patients still fail treatment, and their prognosis is dismal.
Methods
We performed a retrospective study of aNHL patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) at two Mayo Clinic centers between 2018 and 2020. We evaluated predictive factors, toxicities, and responses to salvage regimens after CAR T-cell therapy.
Results
Thirty-four patients received axi-cel with a median length of hospitalization of 14 days. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome of any grade occurred in 91% and 41% of patients, respectively. Furthermore, 71% of patients responded to therapy, with 53% achieving a complete response (CR). The CRS grade and absolute lymphocyte count at leukapheresis (ALCLeuk) correlated with CR and overall survival (OS), respectively. After a median follow-up of 6.8 months (interquartile range [IQR] 4.6–14.9), 15 patients (44%) showed progressive disease (PD). Most patients (60%) progressed during the first 3 months and had persistent CD19 tumor expression. Elevated C-reactive protein at baseline increased the risk of PD, whereas elevated ferritin increased PD and mortality risk. Twelve patients received salvage therapy, but only three responded. Median OS of relapsed/refractory patients to axi-cel was 3 months (IQR 1.3–5.1).
Conclusion
The grade of CRS and ALCLeuk correlated with better outcomes to axi-cel therapy. In addition, elevated inflammatory markers at baseline were associated with PD and shorter survival. Relapses after treatment frequently occur within months after axi-cel infusion; they confer a poor prognosis and create an urgent need for novel and effective treatment options in this patient population.

Abstract: Background
The screening ofTrypanosoma cruzi-infected blood donors using two serological techniques frequently leads to conflicting results. This fact prompted us to evaluate the diagnostic performance of four “in-house” immunodiagnostic tests and two commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).
Material and Methods
One hundred and seventy-nine blood donors, whose screening for Chagas disease was doubtful, underwent three in-house ELISAs, one in-house immunoblotting test (TESA-blot), and two commercial ELISAs (bioMérieux and Wiener) in an attempt to define the presence or absence of infection. Simultaneously, 29 donors with previous positive results from three conventional serological tests and 30 donors with constant negative results were evaluated.
Results
The ELISA-Wiener showed the highest rate in sensitivity (98.92%) and the ELISA-bioMérieux, the highest specificity (99.45%), followed by the TESA-blot, which showed superior performance, with lower false-negative (2.18%) and false-positive (1.12%) rates. In series, the combination composed of the TESA-blot and ELISA-bioMérieux showed slightly superior performance, with trifunctional protein deficiency (TFP)=0.01%.
Conclusion
Our study confirms the high sensitivity and specificity of commercial kits. To confirm the presence or absence of T. cruzi infection, the combination of TESA-blot and ELISA-bioMérieux may be suggested as the best alternative. Individually, the TESA-blot performed the closest to the gold standard; however, it is not commercially available.

Abstract: Oligodendrocytes and their progenitors are glial cells in the central nervous system, which have been mainly implicated with the homeostatic roles of axonal myelin ensheathment but serve as targets of the peripheral immune system attack in the context of diseases like multiple sclerosis. This view of oligodendroglia as passive bystanders with no immunological properties was first challenged in the 1980s when it was reported that the cytokine interferon γ could induce the gene expression of the major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) class I and II. While the physiological role of this induction was controversial for decades to follow, recent studies suggest that oligodendroglia survey their environment, respond to a larger array of cues and can indeed exert immunomodulatory functions, which are particularly relevant in the context of neurodegeneration and demyelinating diseases. The alternative functionality of oligodendroglia not only regulates immune cell responses, but also hinders remyelination, and might thereby be key to understanding MS disease pathology and promoting regeneration after immune-mediated demyelination.

Abstract: The combination of room-temperature phase change materials (PCMs) and building materials can reduce the energy consumption of heating equipment and improve indoor thermal comfort. In this paper, the novel CaCl2·6H2O–CO(NH2)2/SiO2 room-temperature shape-stable composite PCM was fabricated by melt-blending method with CaCl2·6H2O as the basic PCM, CO(NH2)2 as the phase change temperature regulator and hydrophilic fumed silica (SiO2) as the carrier. The temperature-regulating effect of CO(NH2)2 on CaCl2·6H2O and the shape-stabilizing effect of SiO2 on CaCl2·6H2O–CO(NH2)2 PCM were emphatically analyzed. The results revealed that the obtained composite PCM with 6% CO(NH2)2 and 20% SiO2 possessed a favorable form-stability, relatively high enthalpy (114.3 J g-1) and appropriate phase change temperature (21.03 °C) which decreased by 7.81 °C compared with pure CaCl2·6H2O (28.84 °C). Furthermore, its small supercooling degree (0.259 °C), low thermal conductivity (0.3667 W·m-1·K-1) as well as the excellent cyclic reliability and thermal stability indicated that the composite PCM has good thermodynamic properties, enabling its application for indoor building thermal insulation and even some other areas.

Abstract: The mammary gland is dynamically remodelled during its postnatal development and the reproductive cycles. This inherent plasticity has been suggested to increase the susceptibility of the organ to carcinogenesis. Morphological changes in the mammary epithelium involve cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration which, in turn, are affected by cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrin adhesion receptors function in the sensing of the biochemical composition, patterning and mechanical properties of the ECM surrounding the cells, and strongly influence cell fate. This review aims to summarize the existing literature on how different aspects of integrin-mediated adhesion and mechanosensing, including ECM composition; stiffness and topography; integrin expression patterns; focal adhesion assembly; dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton; and nuclear mechanotransduction affect mammary gland development, function and homeostasis. As the mechanical properties of a complex tissue environment are challenging to replicate in vitro, emphasis has been placed on studies conducted in vivo or using organoid models. Outright, these studies indicate that mechanosensing also contributes to the regulation of mammary gland morphogenesis in multiple ways.

Abstract: Introduction
A retrospective ecological longitudinal study was carried out with data on blood components use from two private hospital units that belong to the same organization located in Belo Horizonte between July 2017 and June 2019.
Objectives
To describe the monthly series of red blood cells, platelets and plasma use and the rate of blood components use for general hospitalizations in the health network, from the perspective of time series.
Methods
A total of 15 time series were created with monthly data related to the use of blood components. The stationarity of the series was verified by the unit root test, the trend, by the Cox–Stuart test and seasonality, by the Fisher test (significance levels of 10% for the first test and 5% for the last two).
Results
All series tested positive for the trend component and showed an increasing trend for the use of blood components. Ten series showed statistically significant seasonality and eight series were identified as non-stationary. The percentage of transfusions of blood components due to hospitalization at hospitals 1 and 2 was 29% (22% at hospital 1 and 38.9% at hospital 2).
Conclusion
This study was able to describe the components of blood components use dynamics, from the perspective of time series at hospitals. Due to the growing trend in demand for blood components and their high cost, we propose the reduction of blood components use and the expanded use of alternative blood transfusion strategies.

Abstract: Magnesium is an essential element of life, involved in the regulation of metabolism and homeostasis of all the tissues. It also regulates immunological functions, acting on the cells of innate and adaptive immune systems. Magnesium deficiency primes phagocytes, enhances granulocyte oxidative burst, activates endothelial cells and increases the levels of cytokines, thus promoting inflammation. Consequently, a low magnesium status, which is often underdiagnosed, potentiates the reactivity to various immune challenges and is implicated in the pathophysiology of many common chronic diseases. Here we summarize recent advances supporting the link between magnesium deficiency, inflammatory responses and diseases, and offer new hints towards a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) are a potential clinical material in regenerative medicine applications. Metformin has shown safety and effectiveness as a clinical drug. However, the effect of metformin as a treatment on hUC-MSCs is unclear. Our research aimed to explore the effects of metformin on the osteogenesis, adipogenesis and angiogenesis of hUC-MSCs, and attempted to explain the molecular fluctuations of metformin through the mapping of protein profiles. Proliferation assay, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation induction, cell cycle, flow cytometry, quantitative proteomics techniques and bioinformatics analysis were used to detect the influences of metformin treatment on hUC-MSCs. Our results demonstrated that low concentrations of metformin promoted the proliferation of hUC-MSCs, but high concentrations of metformin inhibited it. Metformin exhibited promotion of osteogenesis but inhibition of adipogenesis. Metformin treated hUC-MSCs up-regulated the expression of osteogenic marker ALP, OCN and RUNX2, but down-regulated the expression of adipogenic markers PPARγ and LPL. Proteomics analysis found that up-regulation of differentially expressed proteins in metformin treatment group involved the biological process of cell migration in Gene Ontology analysis. Metformin enhanced cell migration of HUVEC in a co-culture system, and hUC-MSCs treated with metformin exhibited stronger angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo compared to the hUC-MSCs group. The results of RT-qPCR revealed that the SCF and VEGFR2 were raised in metformin treatment. This study can promote the application of hUC-MSCs treated with metformin to tissue engineering for vascular reconstruction and angiogenesis.

Abstract: Introduction
Although the efficacy of hydroxyurea (HU) in inhibiting erythrocyte sickling has been well demonstrated, the action of this drug on human neutrophils and the mechanism by which it improves the manifestations of the disease have not been studied thoroughly. We aimed to investigate the cell viability, along with inflammatory and oxidative markers in the neutrophils of sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients and the effects of HU therapy on these cells, by evaluating the dose-responsiveness.
Methods
In the present study, 101 patients (45 men and 56 women, aged 18–69 years) with SCA were divided into groups according to the use or not of HU: the SS group (without HU treatment, n = 47) and the SSHU group (under HU treatment, n = 54). The SSHU group was further stratified into subgroups according to the daily dose of the drug that patients already used: SSHU - 0.5 g (n = 19); SSHU - 1 g (n = 26) and SSHU - 1.5–2 g (n = 9). A control group (AA) comprised 50 healthy individuals. Neutrophils isolated from whole blood were analyzed using Trypan Blue, monoiodotyrosine (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) toxicity assays. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and concentrations of interleukin 10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and malonaldehyde (MDA) were also measured.
Results
Neutrophils from SCA patients showed membrane fragility and a significant decrease in cell viability when analyzed by Trypan Blue (p < 0.05), MTT (p < 0.001) and LDH (p = 0.011), compared to the AA group. Levels of inflammatory (MPO, TNF-α, and IL-10) and oxidative markers (SOD, GSH-Px, and MDA) were also altered (p < 0.05) in these cells, showing a significant difference in the SSHU-1g and SSHU - 1.5–2 g groups, compared to the SS group. Treatment with HU reverted the levels of all markers to concentrations similar to those in healthy individuals in a positive dose-effect relationship.
Conclusion
The HU did not generate a cytotoxic effect on neutrophils in SCA patients, but it modulated their oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms, promoting cytoprotection with a positive dose-effect.

Abstract: The development of cardiovascular diseases associated with Type-2 diabetes remains one of the most challenging public health burdens in the developed world. Early onset of metabolic deficiencies, namely dysregulated glucose homeostasis, peripheral insulin resistance, and impaired insulin production are accompanied by both innate and adaptive immune responses that culminate in a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation. Neutrophils are a critical component of the innate immune system which offer frontline defense against pathogens through a variety of potent effector functions. Recent data indicate an essential role of neutrophils in various disease processes that contribute to the development of Type-2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. In this brief review, we aim to distill the most relevant clinical and pre-clinical literature that investigates the role of neutrophils as an important mediator for the Type-2 diabetes/atherosclerosis connection.

Abstract: Summary
Formulated products are complex mixtures of ingredients whose time to market can be difficult to speed due to the lack of general predictable physical models for the desired properties. Here, we report the coupling of a machine learning classification algorithm with the Thompson sampling efficient multiobjective optimization (TSEMO) algorithm for the simultaneous optimization of continuous and discrete outputs. The methodology is successfully applied to the design of a formulated liquid product of commercial interest for which no physical models are available. Experiments are carried out in a semiautomated fashion using robotic platforms triggered by the machine learning algorithms. The procedure allows one to find nine suitable recipes meeting the customer-defined criteria within 15 working days, outperforming human intuition in the target performance of the formulations.

Abstract: Background
Blood transfusion (BT) is essential in treating sickle cell disease (SCD); however, it leads to iron overload (IO) and oxidative stress. We studied the relationship between oxidative stress, iron status parameters, hepcidin mRNA gene expression, and IO in SCD patients.
Methods
We classified all SCD patients (n = 90) into two groups: Group I, 45 children (s.ferritin ≥ 938 ng/mL) and Group II, 45 children (s.ferritin < 938 ng/mL). A total of 55 children, age and sex matched, participated as a control group. Malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrite, s.iron, s.total iron-binding capacity (sTIBC), transferrin saturation %, s.ferritin, s.hepcidin, and hepcidin mRNA gene expression were assessed.
Results
Among SCD BT-dependent patients (>3 times/year), 63% were from Group I and 37% from Group II, p < .01. The two patient groups had significantly lower s.hepcidin and hepcidin gene expression than controls (p < .001). TIBC, s.iron, s.ferritin, transferrin saturation %, ferritin/hepcidin ratio, and MDA levels were higher among SCD patients than controls (p < .001). Group I had higher mean level of ferritin/hepcidin ratio and MDA than Group II (p < .01). The higher level of MDA and increased frequency of BT were the significant predicting risk factors for IO (p < .05). A receiver-operating characteristic curve indicates that MDA is the outstanding significant biomarker for high level of s.ferritin with subsequent IO progression.
Conclusion
MDA may serve as a biomarker of oxidative stress and IO in SCD patients. This result paid attention for urgent initiation of antioxidant and chelation therapy on detecting increased MDA level.

Abstract: Cadmium (Cd) is a transition metal, also referred to as a heavy metal, that is naturally abundant in the earth’s crust. It has no known benefit to humans. It is primarily released into our environment through mining and smelting in industrial processes and enters the food chain through uptake by plants from contaminated soil and water. In humans, Cd primarily enters the body through ingestion of foods and cigarette smoke and has an extremely long resident half-life in the body compared to other transition metals. Environmental workplace exposure is also a source through inhalation, although much less common. The principal organs adversely affected by Cd following acute and chronic exposure are the kidneys, bone, vasculature and lung. Cd adversely impacts cell function through changes in gene expression and signal transduction and is recognized as a carcinogen. Despite a substantial body of mechanistic studies in cells and animal models, the overall impact of Cd on innate immune function in humans remains poorly understood. The best evidence is perhaps alteration of reactive oxygen species balance and signaling in cells that regulate innate immunity causing alteration of the inflammatory response that is postulated to contribute to chronic diseases. Epidemiologic studies support this possibility since increased tissue levels in humans are strongly associated with leading chronic diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which will be discussed in depth. Additional studies are required to understand how chronic exposure and accumulation of this leading environmental toxicant in vital organs negatively impact innate immune function and host defense leading to chronic disease in humans.

Abstract: Introduction
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a serious complication in allogeneic transplantation. The first-line treatment is high doses of corticosteroids. In the absence of response to corticosteroids, several immunosuppressive drugs can be used, but they entail an elevated risk of severe infections. Added to this, there are patients who do not improve on any immunosuppressive treatment, with subsequent deteriorated quality of life and high mortality. Ruxolitinib has been shown to induce responses in refractory patients. In this study we have presented our real-life experience.
Methods
A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with severe GVHD refractory to corticosteroids. Demographic, previous treatment, response and mortality data were collected.
Results
Since 2014, seventeen patients with GVHD were treated with ruxolitinib due to refractoriness to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants and a few to extracorporeal photopheresis, 8 with acute GVHD (1 pulmonary, 4 cutaneous grade IV and 3 digestive grade IV) and 9 with chronic GHVD (5 cutaneous sclerodermiform, 2 pulmonary and 1 multisystemic). The overall response to ruxolitinib treatment for acute GVHD was 80%, 40% with partial response and 40% with complete remission. Global response in chronic GVHD was 79%. The GVHD mortality was only seen in acute disease and was 40%. Causes of mortality in those patients were severe viral pneumonia, post-transplantation hemophagocytic syndrome and meningeal GVHD refractory to ruxolitinib.
Conclusions
In our series, the use of ruxolitinib as a rescue strategy in acute or chronic GVHD was satisfactory. Ruxolitinib treatment in patients with a very poor prognosis showed encouraging results. However, the GVHD mortality remains high in refractory patients, showing that better therapeutic strategies are needed.

Abstract: Objective
In this study, clinico-hematological, genetic and outcome profile of children with BMF was evaluated to delineate the underlying genotype and phenotype.
Design
Cases were evaluated as two groups: Group 1 (n = 56; DBA-23, FA-18, DC-2, UBMFS-13) included children with suspected IBMFS based on clinical phenotype and accessible lab investigations and Group 2 (n = 53) included children with IAA treated with IST. Targeted NGS was carried out in a subset of these children (n = 42) and supplemented with WES wherever required.
Results
We identified causative mutation in overall 15 of 27 tested children (55.5%) in group 1 and 2 of 15 tested children (13.3%) in group 2. In DBA, a mutation was noted in 50% cases with involvement of RPS 19 (75%) and RPL5 (25%) genes. Phenotypic abnormalities were present in 69.5% and response to steroids in 68.4% of cases at a median follow up of 33 months. In children with IAA, overall response (complete + partial) was present in 51% at a median follow up of 23 months. The 3-year OS and FFS for the cohort of IAA were 68% and 48% respectively. Targeted sequencing could also pick up germline mutations in 50% of UBMFS cases and nearly 19% of IAA cases.

Abstract: Background
Bleeding is a common but possibly underreported side effect of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Impairment of primary hemostasis by acquired von Willebrand syndrome (aVWS) and platelet dysfunction as well as activation and consumption of plasmatic coagulation factors contribute to hemorrhage. The aim of the present cohort study of consecutively enrolled patients admitted to our ECMO center was to collect demographic, medical and laboratory data possibly associated with i) development of clinically relevant bleeding and/or ii) death during a 12-months follow-up.
Results
Within a 3-year period 338 white patients aged 18–89 years (median: 60; male 64.5%) were enrolled. 78 of 338 patients (23%) presented with clinical relevant bleeding symptoms. The overall death rate was 74.6% within a median time of 9 days (1–229) post intervention. Logistic-regression analysis adjusted for age and gender revealed that i) the presence of blood group O versus non-O (Odds ratio (OR)/95%CI: 1.9/1.007–3.41), ECMO duration per day (1.1/1.06–1.14), veno-venous versus veno-arterial ECMO cannulation (2.33/1.2–4.5) and the overall need for blood product administered per unit (1.02/1.016–1.028) was independenly associated with bleeding in patients suffering from aVWS. ii) Older age (increase per year) at ECMO start (1.015/1.012–1.029) and an increasing amount of blood product units were significantly related with death (1.007/1.001–1.013). Patients with veno-venous versus veno-arterial cannulation survived longer (0.48/0.24–0.94).
Conclusion
In the present cohort study we found a clinical relevant bleeding rate of 23% in subjects with aVWS associated with blood group O, a longer ECMO duration and veno-venous cannulation.

Abstract: Background
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is currently the only curative treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Methods
We analyzed the outcomes of 93 patients (median age: 52 years) who underwent allo-HCT at our center between 1989 and 2019.
Results
After a median follow-up of 35 months, relapse was observed in 15.1% (n = 14) patients. The estimated 2-year non-relapse mortality, relapse-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were 38.1%, 54.2%, and 58.7%, respectively. The ECOG performance status ≥ 2 (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.1; p = .001) and use of total body irradiation (in a myeloablative conditioning regimen; HR: 2.64; p = .005) were predictive of poor OS after multivariable analysis. The occurrence of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease post-transplant was associated with poor survival (p = .001).
Conclusion
Although the use of kinase and bcl2 inhibitors may result in a decrease in the number and need of transplants, allo-HCT remains a viable option in selected patients with high-risk CLL and good performance status.

Abstract: Stathmin 1 (STMN1) is a cytosolic phosphoprotein that was discovered as a result of its high level of expression in leukemic cells. It plays an important role in the regulation of mitosis by promoting depolymerization of the microtubules that make up the mitotic spindle and, aging has been shown to impair STMN1 levels and change microtubule stability. We have previously demonstrated that a high level of STMN1 expression during early megakaryopoiesis is necessary for proliferation of megakaryocyte progenitors and that down-regulation of STMN1 expression during late megakaryopoiesis is important for megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production. In this report, we examined the effects of STMN1 deficiency on erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages in the mouse. Our studies show that STMN1 deficiency results in mild thrombocytopenia in young animals which converts into profound thrombocythemia as the mice age. STMN1 deficiency also lead to macrocytic changes in both erythrocytes and megakaryocytes that persisted throughout the life of STMN1 knock-out mice. Furthermore, STMN1 knock-out mice displayed a lower number of erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitor cells and had delayed recovery of their blood counts after chemotherapy. These studies show an important role for STMN1 in normal erythro-megakaryopoietic development and suggests potential implications for disorders affecting these hematopoietic lineages.

Abstract: Introduction
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease that affects mainly adults between 50 and 55 years. In Brazil, information from the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS) Outpatient Information System indicates that 12,531 patients had the Autorização de Procedimento Ambulatorial (APAC) approved for the CML treatment in 2017. Disease monitoring through molecular response evaluation is critical to the care of CML patients. The quantitative PCR test (real-time polymerase chain reaction) provides adequate evaluation parameters that allow the health professional to intervene at the right moments in order to reduce the chance of progression of the disease, providing the best outcome to the patient, including the possibility of treatment discontinuation for eligible patients. Although the test is included in the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines (PCDT) of CML, it is not possible to monitor the molecular response within SUS since there is no reimbursement for this test.
Objective
Obtain expert recommendations on the importance, financing, and reimbursement of molecular monitoring in SUS.
Methods
Six CML experts with different perspectives participated in the panel. The discussion was based in the main publications about the quantitative PCR test in CML monitoring.
Results
Experts’ recommendations:1)Molecular monitoring should be part of the integral treatment of patients with CML to reduce the chances of disease progression and costs to the health system;2)The government should put into practice what is provided in the PCDT of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Brazil: performing the monitoring of the molecular response via quantitative PCR;3)The government should create a code with adequate nomenclature and reimbursement value in SIGTAP, so that the test is carried out and covered by the public health network, as it is contained in the PCDT of the disease and the existing APAC does not cover the operational costs for its performance;4)Patients with chronic phase CML should perform a quantitative PCR every 3 months and, after reaching the MMR, should perform the examination every 6 months, as recommended by international guidelines;5)Patients should be monitored in reference laboratories that are standardized according to the international scale;6)The laboratories that are within the reference public centers could absorb all the test demand in Brazil, and other centers could be qualified through an ABHH accreditation;7)Adequate molecular monitoring may allow some patients to stop taking drugs and selffinancing the molecular test for all SUS patients
Conclusion
A solution for the molecular test (BCR-ABL1) funding is urgent to ensure the monitoring of CML patients in SUS. The savings that might be generated with patients that stop taking the medication when adequately monitored may finance the test.

Abstract: Glucolipid metabolism disorder in diabetes mellitus (DM) causes human endothelial injury and autophagy dysfunction is an important cause of endothelial dysfunction (ED). Selenoprotein S (SelS) could protect endothelium from oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. This study assessed the effect of SelS on autophagy in glucolipid metabolic disorders and protection of the resulted vascular endothelial injury. The results showed that high glucose (HG), high oxidized low-density lipoprotein (HL), and HG combined with HL (HGL) could reduce viability of human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), induce HAECs injury and increase SelS expression in a time-dependent manner. HG, HL, and HGL also initially induced autophagy but later reduced it in HAECs, while activity of the Akt/mTOR signaling was inhibited, especially in HGL culture of HAECs. SelS overexpression reduced the endothelial injury and autophagy and activated the Akt/mTOR signaling in HG, HL and HGL-cultured HAECs, compared to the control. Conversely, knockdown of SelS expression had the opposite effects on HAECs. In conclusion, SelS demonstrated a protective effect on endothelial injury induced by high glucose and/or ox-LDL and the underlying molecular events might be related to its regulation of HAECs autophagy by activating the Akt/mTOR signaling. SelS could be a potential intervention target in prevention and treatment of diabetic vascular complications.

Abstract: Introduction
Blood is a valuable life resource that depends on the donation of blood by the community. As a result, it is crucial that the manner in which this expensive resource is used be correct and reasonable.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to investigate the Maximum Blood Ordering for Surgery (MSBOS) in general, orthopedic and neurosurgical elective surgeries at the Poursina Hospital in Rasht in 2017.
Methods
According to the patient file number information, such as gender, age, type of surgery, number of blood units requested, number of cross-matched blood units, number of blood units transfusion, number of patients undergoing transfusion, number of patients who were cross-matched, initial hemoglobin and the underlying disease, was extracted from the HIS (Hospital Information System). Based on the collected data, a descriptive report of the cross-match to transfusion ratio (C/T), transfusion index (TI) and transfusion probability (%T) was performed, using average and standard deviation, by using the SPSS 16.
Results
In the present study, 914 patients from the neurosurgery, orthopedic and general surgery wards of the Poursina Hospital were studied. Of these, 544 were male (59.5%) and 370 were female (40.5%), aged 1–99 years, with a mean age of 43 years. The frequency distribution of C/T in this study was 1.29 in neurosurgery, 1.95 in orthopedic surgery and 1.96 in general surgery. This study indicated that the C/T index was above the normal standard level in four different kinds of surgery, including leg fracture (2.71), cholecystectomy(2.71), forearm fracture (2.70), and skin graft (2.62).The C/T index was at the maximum normal level in thyroidectomy surgery (2.5). The other surgeries had the normal C/T index.
Conclusion
Overall, all of the MSBOS indices were at the standard level in this study, although C/T indices were higher than the standard level in the surgeries for cholecystectomy, leg fracture, forearm fracture, hand fracture and skin graft.

Abstract: Introduction
Knowledge on the characteristics of neuropathic pain in people with sickle cell disease (SCD) may help to provide more effective treatment procedures.
Objective
To describe the characteristics of neuropathic pain in patients with sickle cell disease and identify the impact on their quality of life.
Method
A cross-sectional study (CAAE 57274516.8.0000.5544) was conducted at a reference center in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. The instruments used were the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the Douleur Neuropatique Questionnaire (DN-4), the Anxiety and Depression Hospital scale (ADH) and the abbreviated version of the World Health Organization of Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL-brief). The Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate the association between the scores (5% alpha).
Results
A total of 100 adults with SCD participated in the study, 69.7% of whom had neuropathic pain. Anxiety was present in 99% of the sample and depression, in 100%. Patients with neuropathic pain had worse scores in all domains of quality of life (p < 0.05), but no association was found with pain intensity.
Conclusion
Neuropathic pain was more frequent than nociceptive pain in adults with SCD and generated worse scores in all domains of quality of life. Anxiety and depression were present in patients with both types of pain.

Impact of type 2 diabetes mellitus on the immunoregulatory characteristics of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells,

Abstract: Background
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with several complications. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) represent an emerging type of MSCs with high plasticity and immunoregulatory capabilities and are useful for treating inflammation-related disorders such as T2DM. However, the pathogenic microenvironment of T2DM may affect their therapeutic potential. We aimed to examine the impact of the diabetic milieu on the immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory potential of AT-MSCs.
Methods
We assessed the proliferation potential, cell surface expression of MSC-characteristic markers and immunomodulatory markers, along with the gene expression and protein secretion of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines in AT-MSCs derived from T2DM patients (dAT-MSCs) vs. those derived from non-diabetic volunteers (ndAT-MSCs). Furthermore, we evaluated the IFN-γ priming effect on both groups.
Results
Our data revealed comparable proliferative activities in both groups. Flow cytometric analysis results showed a lower expression of CD200 and CD276 on dAT-MSCs vs. ndAT-MSCs. qPCR demonstrated upregulation of IL-1β associated with a downregulation of IL-1RN in dAT-MSCs vs. ndAT-MSCs. IFN-γ priming induced an elevation in CD274 expression associated with IDO1 and ILRN overexpression and IL-1β downregulation in both groups. ELISA analysis uncovered elevated levels of secreted IL-1β, TNF, and visfatin/NAMPT in dAT-MSCs, whereas IL-1RA and IDO levels were reduced. ELISA results were also evident in the secretome of dAT-MSCs upon IFN-γ priming.
Conclusions
This study suggests that the T2DM milieu alters the immunomodulatory characteristics of AT-MSCs with a shift towards a proinflammatory phenotype which may restrain their autologous therapeutic use. Furthermore, our findings indicate that IFN-γ priming could be a useful strategy for enhancing dAT-MSC anti-inflammatory potential.

Abstract: Inhalation of particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 µm has been reported to exacerbates fatty liver disease. However, the components and mechanisms of particulate matter involved in hepatic lipid metabolism and autophagy have not been fully elucidated. We found that atmospheric particulate matter in Japan stimulated lipogenesis in hepatocytes even when its lipid component was removed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that particulate matter did not promote autophagosome formation but inhibited autophagic degradation in hepatocytes. In previous toxicity experiments, particulate matter collected from atmosphere often contained contaminants originating from filters. In this study, we exposed the powdery particulate matter with less contaminants collected using a cyclone and impactor system to HepG2 cells, human hepatocyte. This particulate matter induced lipogenesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress in HepG2 cells as well as previous reports of particulate matter in the USA and China. On the other hand, when autophagic flux were examined in detail, the particulate matter did not promote autophagosome formation, but inhibited autophagic degradation. Since these effects were similar to those of palmitate, a fatty acid, we prepared particulate matter in which lipid component was removed by acetone and compared the effects on HepG2 cells with those of untreated one. The particulate matter without lipid component induced lipid droplets as well as did the untreated one although it induced less endoplasmic reticulum stress. These results suggest that hepatic lipid synthesis is stimulated not only by the uptake of lipid but also by other components in the particulate matter.

Abstract: Introduction
Smoking is associated with the occurrence and progression of cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory disorders and malignancies.
Objective
To study the platelet indices, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in smokers and their correlation with smoking pack-years.
Method
A total of 110 smokers and 110 non-smokers were included. The smokers were grouped into three groups: mild (<5 pack-years), moderate (5−10 pack-years) and heavy (>10 pack-years). The platelet count, plateletcrit (PCT), mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) were noted. The NLR and PLR were calculated and the statistical analysis was made using the Student’s T-test, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Spearman’s correlation coefficient.
Results
The platelet count, PCT and PDW were significantly higher with mean values: 218.56 ± 121.31 vs 203.23 ± 80.35 (p-value = 0.038), 0.27 ± 0.10 vs 0.26 ± 0.10 (p-value = 0.041) and 12.54 ± 1.45 vs 11.99 ± 1.70 (p-value = 0.001) in smokers and non-smokers, respectively. The PLR differed significantly with mean values: 119.40 ± 84.81 in smokers and 181.99 ± 313.09 in non-smokers, with a p-value of 0.045. A significant positive correlation was found between pack-years of smoking and platelet count and PLR with the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.250 and 0.198 and p-values, 0.008 and 0.037, respectively. The Platelet Count, PCT, MPV and PDW varied significantly between mild, moderate and heavy smoker groups, with p-values of 0.045, 0.010, 0.015 and 0.017, respectively.
Conclusion
The platelet indices and inflammatory markers NLR and PLR are derived from routine blood investigations, which are easily available and inexpensive. The monitoring of platelet indices, along with the PLR, can be used as early predictors of morbidity in smokers.

Abstract: The conventional methods of obtaining solar selective surfaces for high temperature solar thermal applications involve coating of the substrate by various methods such as physical vapor deposition, plasma spraying, anodization, etc. The present work is an attempt to enhance the optical properties of metals by heat treatment. The oxide layers formed by annealing of stainless steel 304 (SS 304) enhance the absorptance in the solar spectrum region. Influences of oxidation temperature and oxidation time span on the values of solar absorptance and thermal emittance have been studied. The annealing of SS 304 substrate was carried out in air at 600–900 °C. The time period of annealing plays a crucial role in the amount of oxides formed and thus is a variable parameter. The absorptance values obtained with isothermal oxidation at shorter and longer durations have been compared at a temperature of 900 °C. A cyclic loading approach is also employed to arrive at the optimal absorptance of the samples. It is further used to study the dependency of solar absorptance on the reaction kinetics with respect to varying oxidation time. Under the optimized annealing conditions, heat-treated SS 304 sample exhibited an absorptance of 0.920 and an emittance of 0.37. A plausible model for the high optical absorption in these oxidized surfaces with relatively low thermal emittance is rationalized. High temperature materials such as Inconel and Nimonic have also been subjected to isothermal annealing and the absorptance values were found to be 0.887 and 0.880, respectively.

Abstract: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a chronic, multi-systemic, progressive and life-threatening disease characterized by intravascular hemolysis, thrombotic events, serious infections and bone marrow failure. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria results from the expansion of a clone of hematopoietic cells that due to an inactivating mutation of the X-linked gene PIG-A are deficient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins. Early diagnosis, using flow cytometry performed on peripheral blood, the gold standard test to confirm the diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, is essential for improved patient management and prognosis. The traditional therapy for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria includes blood transfusion, anti-thrombosis prophylaxis or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The treatment that has recently become available is the complement blockade by the anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab. In this consensus, we are aiming to review the diagnosis and treatment of the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria patients, as well as the early recognition of its systemic complications. These procedures express the opinions of experts and have been based on the best available evidence and international guidelines, with the purpose of increasing benefits and reducing harm to patients.

Abstract: In order to demonstrate that digital material engineering methodology is able to address the design and optimisation of architectured ceramic materials, solar volumetric receivers employed in Solar Thermal Power Plants (STPP) have been studied. A digital design approach for obtaining new receivers, at the macroscopic structural scale, is proposed. This approach couples virtual structure generation, ray tracing and thermal simulations at the scale of the base structural components (microscopic scale). Then, a recently developed process for manufacturing silicon carbide (SiC) parts by binder jetting is used to elaborate three optimised structures which are tested on-sun at high temperature in a solar concentrator reproducing the STPP operation conditions. The results obtained with these structures, having original shapes, are promising: the average experimental outlet air temperature reaches a maximum of 1133 K, energy yields can reach 0.49 despite high experimental heat losses, and all the SiC structures, made with a new material based on 3D printing, withstood the high temperatures reached, up to 1500 K. Comparison between digital and experimental results shows that the approach presented in this paper paves the way to a new digital material engineering approach.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma is a refractory cancer of plasma cells. Although treatment strategies for multiple myeloma are getting improved year by year, in most cases patients relapse due to the emergence of drug-resistant mutations in the myeloma cells. The interplay between myeloma cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is important for the pathology. We thought that some heptamer-type sgRNAs for TRUE gene silencing would be able to transform TAM toward the M1 state and might become therapeutic drugs for myeloma. Here, we searched for heptamer-type sgRNAs that can shift macrophages toward the M1 state. We screened a heptamer-type sgRNA library for the ability to up-regulate IL-12b gene expression in human macrophage-like cell lines, and found three such sgRNAs. One of the sgRNAs, H12960, which also showed such ability in human fresh macrophages and mouse macrophage-like cell lines, efficiently suppressed human myeloma cell growth in SCID/NOD mice.

Abstract: Objective
Low levels of neutrophils can be an intrinsic condition, with no clinical consequences or immunity impairment. This condition is the benign constitutional neutropenia (BCN), defined as an absolute neutrophils count (ANC) ≤2000 cells/mm. Diagnosis of BCN is of exclusion where patients are submitted to blood tests and possibly to invasive diagnostic search until secondary causes of neutropenia are ruled out. The natural history of the disease suggests benign evolution and Brazilian study showed an overall frequency of 2.59%. The main mechanisms include reduced neutrophil production, increased marginalization, extravasation to the tissues and immune destruction. Genetic studies showed strong association between the single nucleotide variant rs2814778 located on chromosome 1q23.2 in the promoter region of the atypical chemokine receptor 1 (Duffy blood group system) gene (ACKR1, also termed DARC) and BCN. The aim of this study is to evaluate FY phenotypes and genotypes including the analysis of the rs2814778 SNP in Brazilian patients with BCN in order to determine an effective diagnostic tool, allowing reassurance of the patient and cost reduction in their care.
Methods
Case control study, with 94 individuals (18 patients and 76 controls). Phenotyping was performed by gel test and genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP.
Results
White blood cell (WBC) and absolute neutrophils (AN) counts showed lower levels in patients compared to controls. In the patient group 83.3% were genotyped as FY*B/FY*B. The SNP rs2814778 (-67T > C) was identified in 77.8% of the patients genotyped as FY*B-67C/FY*B-67C. In the control group, 72.7% were homozygous for the wild type and 23.3% were heterozygous.
Conclusion
This study reinforces that FY phenotyping and genotyping can be used to detect most people with BCN, avoiding excessive diagnostic investigation. Besides, this procedure may reduce health costs and be reproductible in clinical practice.

Abstract: Strokes are feared complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) and yield significant neurologic and neurocognitive deficits. However, even without detectable strokes, SCD patients have significant neurocognitive deficits in domains of learning and memory, processing speed and executive function. In these cases, mechanisms unrelated to major cerebrovascular abnormalities likely underlie these deficits. While oxidative stress and stress-related signaling pathways play a role in SCD pathophysiology, their role in cerebral injury remains unknown. We have shown that Townes and BERK SCD mice, while not having strokes, recapitulate neurocognitive deficits reported in humans. We hypothesized that cognitive deficits in SCD mice are associated with cerebral oxidative stress. We showed that SCD mice have increased levels of reactive oxygen species, protein carbonylation, and lipid peroxidation in hippocampus and cortex, thus suggesting increased cerebral oxidative stress. Further, cerebral oxidative stress was associated with caspase-3 activity alterations and vascular endothelial abnormalities, white matter changes, and disruption of the blood brain barrier, similar to those reported after ischemic/oxidative injury. Additionally, after repeated hypoxia/reoxygenation exposure, homozygous Townes had enhanced microglia activation. Our findings indicate that oxidative stress and stress-induced tissue damage is increased in susceptible brain regions, which may, in turn, contribute to neurocognitive deficits in SCD mice.

Abstract: High radiation tolerance of GaAs1-xSbx based solar cells is demonstrated for the low-intensity-low-temperature (LILT) conditions of the target planets Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. The GaAs1-xSbx-based cells are irradiated with high energy electrons to assess the effect of harsh radiation environment on the solar cell and the response of the cell is then investigated in terms of its photovoltaic operation. This system shows significant radiation resistance to the high energy electron environment for the conditions of the planets of interest. An unusual increase of the short circuit current after irradiation is observed at low temperature, which is supported by a simultaneous increase in the external quantum efficiency of the cell under the same conditions. The open circuit voltage and fill factor of the cell are especially tolerant to irradiation, which is also reflected in unchanged dark current-voltage characteristics of the solar cell upon irradiation particularly at LILT.

Abstract: Pain is a hallmark of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) affecting patients throughout their life; the first pain crisis may occur at any age and is often the first presentation of the disease. Universal newborn screening identifies children with SCD at birth, significantly improving morbidity and mortality. Without early screening, diagnosis is generally made after disease manifestations appear. The Consortium for the Advancement of Sickle Cell Research (CASiRe) is an international collaborative group evaluating the clinical severity of subjects with SCD using a validated questionnaire and medical chart review, standardized across 4 countries (United States, United Kingdom, Italy and Ghana). We investigated the age of first pain crisis in 555 sickle cell subjects, 344 adults and 211 children. Median age of the first crisis in the whole group was 4 years old, 5 years old among adults and 2 years old among children. Patients from the United States generally reported the first crisis earlier than Ghanaians. Experiencing the first pain crisis early in life correlated with the genotype and disease severity. Early recognition of the first pain crisis could be useful to guide counseling and management of the disease.

Abstract: The essential role of mammary gland stroma in the regulation of mammary epithelial development, function, and cancer has long been recognized. Only recently, though, the functions of individual stromal cell populations have begun to become more clarified. Mammary fibroblasts have emerged as master regulators and modulators of epithelial cell behavior through paracrine signaling, extracellular matrix production and remodeling, and through regulation of other stromal cell types. In this review article, we summarize the crucial studies that helped to untangle the roles of fibroblasts in mammary gland development. Furthermore, we discuss the origin, heterogeneity, and plasticity of mammary fibroblasts during mammary development and cancer progression.

Abstract: Ring finger proteins contain a characteristic ring finger motif and perform a wide range of biological functions in living organisms. These genes are abnormally expressed in many cancers. We found that the expression level of Ring finger protein 220 (RNF220) was negatively correlated with the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. Moreover, the mRNA level of this gene is significantly higher in the bone marrow cells of AML patients than in the mobilized peripheral blood haematopoietic stem cells of healthy donors. The overexpression of RNF220 promotes the proliferation of AML cells and accelerates the transition from G1 phase to S phase. Increased protein levels and decreased ubiquitylation levels of Cyclin D1 were observed in the nuclei of cells overexpressing RNF220 compared to those of control cells. The protein level of USP22 was also increased in cells overexpressing RNF220. RNF220 cannot enhance the stability of the Cyclin D1 protein without increased expression of the USP22 protein. Our study provided proof of principle to show that RNF220 promotes stabilization of the Cyclin D1 protein via USP22.

Abstract: Introduction
Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) has been shown to be an efficient method of improving exercise tolerance and inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength in several diseases. The effects of IMT on patients with sickle cell anemia (SCD) are relatively unknown. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of IMT on adult SCD patients, regarding respiratory muscle strength (RMS) variables, lung function, exercise tolerance, blood lactation concentration, limitation imposed by dyspnea during daily activities and impact of fatigue on the quality of life.
Methods
This was a randomized single-blind study, with an IMT design comprising true load (TG) and sham load (SG) groups. Initial assessment included spirometry, volumetric capnography (VCap) and measurement of RMS by maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure (PImax and PEmax). The Medical Research Council dyspnea scale and modified fatigue impact scale were also applied and blood lactate concentration was measured before and after the 6-minute walk test. After this initial assessment, the patient used the IMT device at home daily, returning every 6 weeks for RMS reassessment. Both groups used the same device and were unaware of which group they were in. After a period totaling 18 weeks, patients underwent the final evaluation, as initially performed.
Results
Twenty-five patients in total participated until the end of the study (median age 42 years). There were no significant differences between TG and SG based on age, sex, body mass index or severity of genotype. At the end of the training, both groups showed a significant increase in PEmax and PImax, improvement in Vcap and in exercise tolerance and dyspnea reduction while performing daily life activities. The same was observed in patients grouped according to disease severity (HbSS and HbSβ0 vs HbSC and HbSβ+), without differences between groups.
Conclusion
Home-based inspiratory muscle training benefits outpatients with SCD, including the sham load group.

Abstract: Introduction
We performed cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses of the modified International Consortium on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia protocol in Mexico for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia.
Methods
We performed a three-state Markov analysis: stable disease (first line complete response [CR]), disease event (relapse, second line response and CR) and death. The modified IC-APL protocol is composed of three phases: induction, consolidation and maintenance. Cost and outcomes were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs); quality-adjusted life-years were used to calculate incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs).
Results
The CR was achieved in 18 patients (90%), treated with the IC-APL protocol as the first-line option; one patient (5%) died in induction, another one never achieved CR (5%); of the 18 patients that achieved CR, 1 relapsed (5.5%). The median treatment cost of the IC-APL protocol was $21,523 USD. The average life-year in our study was 7.8 years, while the average quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was 6.1 years. When comparing the ICER between the IC-APL and the all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) plus arsenic trioxide (ATO) protocols, we found the different costs of $6497, $19,133 and $17,123 USD in Italy, the USA and Canada, respectively. In relation to the ICUR, we found the different costs to be $13,955 and $11,979 USD in the USA and Canada, respectively.
Conclusion
Taking into account the similar response rates, lower cost and easy access to the modified IC-APL regimen, we consider it a cost-effective and cost-utility protocol, deeming it the treatment of choice for our population.

Abstract: CD28 null T helper (Th) cells are rare in healthy individuals, but they are increased in various inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. In this study, we determined the size of the CD4+/CD28 null T lymphocyte compartment in the peripheral blood of 40 autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) patients (idiopathic and secondary) and 20 healthy control subjects, using tri-color flow cytometry. The frequency and absolute count of CD4+/CD28 null T helper (Th) cells was significantly higher in idiopathic AIHA patients, compared to healthy controls (p = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively) and to patients with secondary AIHA (p = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). The percentage of CD4+/CD28 null Th cells was also negatively correlated to the hemoglobin (Hb) level (p = 0.03). These findings demonstrate, for the first time, the expansion of this phenotypically-defined population of T lymphocytes in patients with idiopathic AIHA and indicate that it likely plays an etiological role in the development of this disease. However, establishing the use of this marker for diagnosis or monitoring treatment of such patients needs further studies.

Abstract: Pure vapor method shows particular advantages in preparing large-area uniform and conformal perovskite film, which can be applied to manufacture perovskite modules and fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). Here, we provide details on controlling the vapor-solid reaction to acquire high-quality perovskite films, including precisely adjusting vapor pressure and organic salts component, vapor-solid reaction, and post-annealing perovskite film. By employing the optimized conditions, we obtained high-quality perovskite films. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the inverted structure device can reach as high as 18.1% with an absorber bandgap of 1.62 eV, among the highest PCE using the vapor technique (Table S1). Significantly, the large-area perovskite film has uniform crystallinity and coverage on textured silicon. Thus, the pure vapor fabrication method of perovskite films shed light on the application of perovskite solar cells because of the potential in module and tandem solar cells.

Abstract: Hemoglobin E (HbE)/β-thalassemia is a form of β-hemoglobinopathy that is well-known for its clinical heterogeneity. Individuals suffering from this condition are often found to exhibit increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels – a factor that may contribute to their reduced blood transfusion requirements. This study hypothesized that the high HbF levels in HbE/β-thalassemia individuals may be guided by microRNAs and explored their involvement in the disease pathophysiology. The miRNA expression profile of hematopoietic progenitor cells in HbE/β-thalassemia patients was investigated and compared with that of healthy controls. Using miRNA PCR array experiments, eight miRNAs (hsa-miR-146a-5p, hsa-miR-146b-5p, hsa-miR-148b-3p, hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-192-5p, hsa-miR-335-5p, hsa-miR-7-5p, hsa-miR-98-5p) were identified to be significantly up-regulated whereas four miRNAs (hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-miR-320a, hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-miR-92a-3p) were significantly down-regulated. Target analysis found them to be associated with several biological processes and molecular functions including MAPK and HIF-1 signaling pathways – the pathways known to be associated with HbF upregulation. Results of dysregulated miRNAs further indicated that miR-17/92 cluster might be of critical importance in HbF regulation. The findings of our study thus identify key miRNAs that can be extrinsically manipulated to elevate HbF levels in β-hemoglobinopathies.

Abstract: Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient that plays a key role in regulating the immune system. T cells are of particular interest due to their important role in promoting adaptive immunity against pathogens and cancer as well as regulating tolerance, all of which are influenced by dietary Se levels. The biological effects of Se are mainly exerted through the actions of the proteins into which it is inserted, i.e. selenoproteins. Thus, the roles that selenoproteins play in regulating T cell biology and molecular mechanisms involved have emerged as important areas of research for understanding how selenium affects immunity. Members of this diverse family of proteins exhibit a wide variety of functions within T cells that include regulating calcium flux induced by T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, shaping the redox tone of T cells before, during, and after activation, and linking TCR-induced activation to metabolic reprogramming required for T cell proliferation and differentiation. This review summarizes recent insights into the roles that selenoproteins play in these processes and their implications in understanding how Se may influence immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Adhesion-mediated cell sorting has long been considered an organizing principle in developmental biology. While most computational models have emphasized the dynamics of segregation to fully sorted structures, cell sorting can also generate a plethora of transient, incompletely sorted states. The timescale of such states in experimental systems is unclear: if they are long-lived, they can be harnessed by development or engineered in synthetic tissues. Here, we use experiments and computational modeling to demonstrate how such structures can be systematically designed by quantitative control of cell composition. By varying the number of highly adhesive and less adhesive cells in multicellular aggregates, we find the cell-type ratio and total cell count control pattern formation, with resulting structures maintained for several days. Our work takes a step toward mapping the design space of self-assembling structures in development and provides guidance to the emerging field of shape engineering with synthetic biology.

Abstract: The under-representation of women in blood donation can lead to blood shortages. We aimed to determine the factors, which encourage or impede blood donations in women. The findings can help us in designing effective recruitment strategies that could encourage women to donate blood to cover the patients’ needs. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Shiraz, Iran, from the 1st of January 2017 to the 1st of August 2017 on women aged 18–60 years old. The demographic characteristics of the participants, the reasons that motivate blood donors and the factors that discourage non-donors were surveyed. Reasons for lapses in donors were also mentioned. The most frequent reasons for blood donation were altruistic causes (94.4%), moral and personal obligations (89.1%), the feeling of responsibility (82.7%), and awareness of the positive effects on their health (77.4%). The most common deterrents in non-donors were fear of developing anemia (68.4%) or weakness and dizziness (66%), unsuitability due to certain medical conditions (62.4%), and lack of a situation in which they were asked to donate blood (61.8%). Although altruistic reasons are the chief motivating factors for women to donate blood, the overall female contribution in blood donation remains low. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures aiming at informing women about the importance of blood donation and to reduce fears based on misinformation. Confidence in the blood donation organization must be a major consideration in future recruitment strategies to reassure women about the safety of blood donation.

Abstract: The maximum achievable silicon single junction solar cell efficiency is limited by intrinsic recombination and by its limited capability of absorbing sun light. For Lambertian light trapping the maximum theoretical solar cell efficiency is around 29.5%. Recently a new approach for light trapping has been proposed for silicon photovoltaics. Highly regular structures with a size in the range of the wavelengths of the incident light act as so-called photonic crystals. Such structures allow wave-interference light trapping beyond the Lambertian limit. Applying these photonic crystals to silicon solar cells can help to reduce the absorber thickness and thus to minimizing the unavoidable intrinsic recombination. From a simulation study, we can conclude that 31.6% is the maximum possible single junction solar cell efficiency for a 15 μm-thin substrate. Furthermore, we present a process flow for the preparation of regular inverted pyramid structure, that acts as photonic crystal. Finally, regular inverted pyramid structures are prepared on polished and shiny-etched, i. e. on surfaces with a certain roughness, substrates. Surface passivation of these structured surfaces shows as good lifetimes as on conventional randomly pyramid textured surface. Excellent total saturation current densities on asymmetric samples of 4 ± 2 fA/cm2 for n-type and of 4.5 ± 2.2 fA/cm2 on p-type substrates are obtained.

The mechanism of Ag-NPs in-situ growth on dielectric films, and the influence of the dielectric materials, the thickness of dielectric film and the reaction time on the morphologies of Ag-NPs were investigated. Moreover, the Ag-NPs have been integrated into the rear dielectric layers (Al2O3/SiNx) of bifacial monocrystalline silicon passivated-emitter–rear-contact (mono-Si PERC) solar cells. The cells show not only the acceptable electrical performance, i.e. the average efficiency gain ~0.04% and the highest efficiency of 22.71%, but also the tunable rear colors. The research in this paper provides a feasible approach for tunning the rear color of the solar cells, which has potential to be applied in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) in terms of aesthetical aspects.

Abstract: Introduction
Daratumumab is a CD38-targeting monoclonal antibody with established efficacy and safety in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). We report results of an early access protocol (EAP) of daratumumab monotherapy for RRMM in a cohort of Brazilian patients.
Methods
Patients with RRMM and ≥3 prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), or who were double refractory to both a PI and IMiD received daratumumab, 16 mg/kg, intravenously weekly for 8 weeks, biweekly for 16 weeks, and every 4 weeks thereafter until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, loss of clinical benefit, or study conclusion or if daratumumab became available with reimbursement.
Results
Forty-nine patients received ≥1 dose of daratumumab. The median (range) duration of treatment was 6.4 (0.3−11.8) months, with a median (range) of 8 (1−13) treatment cycles. Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 38.8% of patients, most frequently neutropenia and pneumonia (10.2% each). Seven (14.3%) patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs; 3 patients discontinued due to daratumumab-related TEAEs. Serious TEAEs occurred in 38.8% of patients. Infusion-related reactions were reported in 25 (51.0%) patients, were primarily grade 1/2, and the majority (23 patients) occurred during the first infusion. Twenty (40.8%) patients achieved a partial response or better; median progression-free survival was 8.25 (95% confidence interval, 5.55–17.54) months.
Conclusion
In this EAP, daratumumab monotherapy in Brazilian patients showed a safety and efficacy profile consistent with clinical studies of daratumumab monotherapy in patients with heavily pretreated RRMM. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02477891.

Abstract: Microvesicles are formed through shedding from the plasma membrane, a process shared by almost all human cells. Microvesicles are highly abundant and have been detected in blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva. They contain a library of cargo derived from their parental cell during formation, including proteases, micro-RNAs and lipids and delivery of this parental cell-derived cargo to other cells can alter target cell function and drive disease. Cell specific molecules on the surface of microvesicles, obtained during microvesicle formation, allows their parental cell to be identified and populations of microvesicles to be investigated for roles in the pathogenesis of various diseases. For instance, recent work by our group has identified a role for neutrophil microvesicles in atherosclerosis. Microvesicle profiles could in future be associated with certain diseases and act as a biomarker to allow for earlier diagnosis. This short review will discuss some of the processes central to all microvesicles before focusing on neutrophil microvesicles, their potential role in cardiovascular disease and the mechanisms that may underpin this.

Abstract: Immune deregulation has a critical role in the pathogenesis of lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage have been reported to contribute to the inflammatory process in MDS through impaired phagocytosis of the apoptotic hemopoietic cells and abnormal production of cytokines. In the present study we assessed the number of peripheral blood (PB) monocyte subsets, namely the classical CD14bright/CD16−, intermediate CD14bright/CD16+ and non-classical CD14dim/CD16+ cells, in patients with lower risk (low/intermediate-I) MDS (n = 32). We also assessed the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α by patient PB monocytes in response to immune stimulus as well as their transcriptome profile. Compared to age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n = 19), MDS patients had significantly lower number of classical and increased number of intermediate monocytes. Patient intermediate monocytes displayed increased production of TNFα following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, compared to healthy individuals. Transcriptional profiling comparison of CD16+ monocytes from patients and controls revealed 43 differentially expressed genes mostly associated with biological pathways/processes relevant to hemopoiesis, immune signaling and cell adhesion. These data provide evidence for the first-time that distinct monocyte subsets display abnormal quantitative and functional characteristics in lower risk MDS substantiating their role in the immune deregulation associated with the disease.

Abstract: Summary
Owing to multiple-electron transfer of producing CH4 from photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2PR), a great challenge is achieving high selectivity of CH4, especially under long-wavelength irradiation. Herein, we synthesize a series of monolayer Ni3X-layered double hydroxide (LDH) (m-Ni3X-LDH, X = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co). When applied for CO2PR, the selectivity of CH4 exhibits a volcano-like trend with the highest point at m-Ni3Mn-LDH using Ru-complex as the photosensitizer. After further optimization, nearly 99% selectivity of CH4 is achieved under irradiation with λ = 600 nm. Accordingly, structural characterizations prove the presence of metal and hydroxyl defect sites, in which the surface valence states of Ni and O exhibit a volcano-like trend with the lowest point at m-Ni3Mn-LDH. Thus, the high selectivity of CH4 could be attributed to the efficient electron-hole migration and separation in m-Ni3Mn-LDH. Moreover, the electron-rich Ni-O bond in m-Ni3Mn-LDH may act as the adsorption site for CO∗, promoting the further hydrogenation of CO to CH4 and improving the selectivity of CH4.

Abstract: Introduction
Children and adolescents with cancer are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition and require special attention on nutritional assessment. An adequate nutritional status during treatment is essential in reducing morbidity and mortality, being a modifiable risk factor for clinical outcomes. This study aims to determine the nutritional status of pediatric patients with cancer assessed by the nutrition team at diagnosis and evaluate its association with the overall survival.
Method
This is a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients at the time of cancer diagnosis who had nutritional assessments when hospitalized or referred to the nutrition outpatient clinic. Nutritional status was classified by the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and body mass index for age z-score (zBMI/A). The Cox regression analysis was used to determine the association between the nutritional status and overall survival, adjusting for gender, tumor group and age.
Results
The study included 366 patients. The prevalence of undernutrition varied from 8 to 23% and overweight, from 5 to 20%. The MUAC identified more children as undernourished than the zBMI/A in patients with solid and hematological tumors. There was no significant difference in the overall survival by malnutrition classified by the zBMI/A (p =  0.1507) or MUAC (p =  0.8135). When adjusted for gender, tumor group and age, the nutritional status classification by the zBMI/A (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88–1.83; p =  0.209) and MUAC (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.61–1.44; p =  0.773) did not impact overall survival.
Conclusion
The nutritional status at diagnosis did not significantly impact the overall survival, which suggests there may have been a protective effect by successful nutritional intervention during the subsequent care.

Abstract: Sympathetic nervous system activation plays a role in the development of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The primary objective was to compare the cause-specific hazard of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) in the context of ß-blocker use and type (selective vs. non-selective). Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and cumulative incidence of relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM), and grade II-IV and III-IV aGVHD and cGVHD. The current study included 151 patients ages 18 and older diagnosed with hematological malignancies who underwent reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT from HLA matched related or unrelated donors between January 2014 and 2017. 31 patients were on a ß-blocker of which 71% were on a selective ß-blocker. The incidence of aGVHD was not different among groups. Results show a non-significant trend in the association between ß-blocker use and reduction in the risk of developing cGVHD (cause-specific hazard ratio 0.49, p = 0.060), with no negative impact on survival or relapse. The current data are supportive of a potential ß-adrenergic influence on the pathogenesis of GVHD, consistent with the inflammatory etiology of GVHD and the anti-inflammatory effects of ß-adrenergic antagonists.

Abstract: Even healthy older adults experience gastrointestinal (GI) and neurological changes. In fact, the aging process of these two systems are interrelated due the extensive, multifaceted communication network connecting them, termed the gut-brain axis. Age-related modification of the GI environment can influence the bacterial species that survive and thrive there. Additionally, the lifestyle common to older adults in the West, including sedentariness, polypharmacy, and a poor diet, can compound the effect of aging on the GI tract, gut microbiota, and nervous system. Emerging animal and human findings suggest that GI organisms play a major role in gut-brain communication, ultimately shaping neurological aging trajectories by either helping to maintain nervous system function into late life or promoting pathology. Aging and age-related behaviors help to define the gut microbiota’s composition and function, but, conversely, the gut microbiota may help to determine late-life functionality and may be harnessed to limit the prevalence of steep neurological decline and diseases. Focusing primarily on clinical research, this review first defines the gut-brain axis, then details age-related GI and nervous system changes, and discusses the impact of age-related lifestyle factors on the GI and nervous systems. The remainder of this review describes cutting-edge research that positions the gut microbiota as an arbiter of age-related neurological decline.

Abstract: Introduction
To study the efficacy and safety of single large volume leukapheresis by using generic G-CSF or G-CSF plus Plerixafor in achieving adequate stem cell yield and various factors influencing thereof in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant .
Method
This prospective study was undertaken among 55 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant and aged between 18 and 75 years. Mobilization and harvesting of stem cells were performed by using GCSF or GCSF plus Plerixafor and large volume leukapheresis, respectively. A stem cell yield of ≥2×106kg–1 and the number of apheresis procedures were primary efficacy endpoints, while the ideal stem cells yield >5×106kg–1, the engraftment day and D100 response/graft sustainability were secondary endpoints.
Result
The primary endpoint was achieved in all cases in both the groups by using a single LVL leukapheresis procedure. Fulfillment of all the secondary endpoints was satisfactory and comparable in both the groups. Age, pre-apheresis CD34+ count and number of interruptions during the LVL were significant factors influencing the stem cell yield (p<0.05). Adverse drug reactions during the apheresis and post-ASCT period were manageable.
Conclusion
The LVL is safe and cost-effective in attaining a minimum of CD34+ cells in a single procedure with manageable adverse reactions. Judicious intervention during the procedure may be helpful in ensuring the adequate yield.

Abstract: In current article, several 3D models of PVT/NEPCM (photovoltaic thermal system integrated with nano-enhanced phase change material) are evaluated numerically. The impact of different quantities of trapezoidal fins on the efficiency of PVT/NEPCM collectors (i.e. PVT/NEPCM without fins, with 10, 14, and 18 fins), with utilization of Al2O3/RT35-HC 0.04%vol. as NEPCM and SiC/water nano-fluid 0.04%vol. as coolant is investigated. Moreover, the effect of different solar flux intensities on the efficiency of the PVT/NEPCM collector was examined. Additionally, a 3D PVT/nano-fluid system with SiC/water nano-fluid as coolant is modeled to conduct a comparative investigation between PVT/NEPCM and PVT system. To model the charging and solidification of NEPCM, an enthalpy-porosity approach is applied. Furthermore, to model governing equations using computational fluid dynamic (CFD), a pressure-based finite volume technique with a transient solver is chosen. In order to provide coupling among the velocity and pressure, the SIMPLE model was utilized. Based on the numerical results, by utilizing trapezoidal fins in paraffin zone, the PV average temperature, and outlet temperature of coolant reduce, while the melting fraction of NEPCM enhances. Furthermore, the outcomes of study indicate that for the highest irradiation, the thermal performance of PVT/NEPCM system with 18 fins reaches 79.54%, which is 9.47% higher than the PVT/NEPCM without fins. Moreover, the liquid fraction of NEPCM for the PVT/NEPCM system with 18 fins reaches 57.15%, which is 2.94% higher than the system with 14 fins, 3.3% higher than the system with 10 fins, and 16.74% higher than the system without fins.

Abstract: A one-step preparation of carbon and dielectric composites with a skeleton-skin structure by sol–gel strategy was proposed in this study. General strategies and comprehensive view on recent knowledge regarding nanocomposites were presented herein. Considering carbon-silica (C–SiO2) composite films as the model system, the insights into the mechanism of wet chemistry in sol were expounded in detail. The structure and crystallization process of nano carbon after annealing process were investigated, revealing that the average sp2 cluster size of nano carbon was in the range from 0.64 to 0.71 nm. The prepared composite films consisted of carbon-covered SiO2 skeleton with intimate interfaces. The film was found to possess excellent adjustable electrical and optical properties, benefited from the rugged composite structure containing nano carbon. With proper heat treatment, the film exhibited the related properties of a solar-selective absorbent material and corresponding low resistivity (about 10−2 Ω cm−1). Thus it can act as a potential candidate for conductive coating. The related simulation analysis concluded that the material consisted of a skeleton-skin structure.

Abstract: Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has a crucial role in immune response and tumor immunity. Because of its anti-tumor effects, IFNγ has been used in cancer treatment. However, IFNγ also has tumor-promoting functions that are less well understood. Here, we show that IFNγ induces expression of the pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) in ovarian cancer (OC) cells. The IFNγ-induced IL-8 expression is dependent on JAK1, STAT1, and p65 NFκB, and is associated with an increased occupancy of K314/315 acetylated p65 NFκB and Ser-727 phosphorylated STAT1 at the IL-8 promoter. Neutralization of IL-8 using anti-IL-8 antibody reduces IFNγ-induced migration of OC cells, and their invasion ability in 3D spheroids. Together, these findings identify IL-8 as a novel target induced by IFNγ/JAK1/STAT1/p65 NFκB signaling, and indicate that the IFNγ-induced IL-8 contributes to IFNγ pro-tumorigenic effects in ovarian cancer cells.

Abstract: KCl–CaCl2 molten salt has emerged as a potential candidate which can be used for heat transfer and thermal energy storage in the next concentrating solar power generation. In this work, deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations, based on a many-body potential and interatomic forces generated by a deep neural network trained with the first-principles simulation results, were carried out to predict the local structure and thermophysical properties of KCl–CaCl2 molten salt at 1100 K. It was found that the steric hindrance effect became more and more intense as the network structure forming and growing with the addition of CaCl2, but the increase of CaCl2 made the coordination shell of Ca2+ more dynamic and active, and the two reactions constantly compete. Afterwards, thermophysical properties like shear viscosity, heat capacity and thermal conductivity were calculated from DPMD simulations. DPMD simulations could balance the proper description of complex atomic interactions to overcome the challenge of missing potential parameters in classical molecular simulations and become more efficient than first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Our work based on deep potentials development will provide a promising alternative way to explore more molten eutectic salts for the next concentrating solar power generation.

Abstract: Oligodendrocytes are highly specialized glial cells, responsible for producing myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). The multi-stage process of oligodendrocyte development is tightly regulated to ensure proper lineage progression of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to mature myelin producing oligodendrocytes. This developmental process involves complex interactions between several intrinsic signaling pathways that are modulated by an array of extrinsic factors. Understanding these regulatory processes is of crucial importance, as it may help to identify specific molecular targets both to enhance plasticity in the normal CNS and to promote endogenous recovery following injury or disease. This review describes two major regulators that play important functional roles in distinct phases of oligodendrocyte development: OPC proliferation and differentiation. Specifically, we highlight the roles of the extracellular astrocyte/radial glia-derived protein Endothelin-1 in OPC proliferation and the intracellular Akt/mTOR pathway in OPC differentiation. Lastly, we reflect on how recent advances in neuroscience and scientific technology will enable greater understanding into how intrinsic and extrinsic regulators interact to generate oligodendrocyte diversity.

Abstract: Introduction
To date, many studies have validated the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Specific Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) scoring system in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), but studies from developing countries remain scarce. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate and categorize Mexican patients using the HCT-CI at a referral center.
Methods
One hundred and nineteen consecutive patients undergoing allo-HSCT at the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition in Mexico City were included. Patients were classified according to the HCT-CI scores.
Results
The median age was 31 years and most were males (56%). Most patients had hematological malignancies (73%) and a low HCT-CI score (72%). The non-relapse mortality and survival were predicted according to the score.
Conclusions
This is one of the few studies to evaluate the HCT-CI in adults with HLA-matched donors in a developing country and our findings suggest that the high percentage of patients with a low HCT-CI scores, contrary to international reports, could be explained by different comorbidities and demographics, but mainly due to stricter filters applied to HSCT candidates and consequently, a potential selection bias caused by limited resources.

Abstract: Background
Multiple myeloma is a disease of the elderly. However, 40% of patients are diagnosed before 65 years old. Outcomes regarding age as a prognostic factor in MM are heterogeneous.
Method
We retrospectively analyzed clinical characteristics, response to treatment and survival of 282 patients with active newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma, comparing results between patients younger and older than 65 years.
Main results
The frequency of multiple myeloma in those younger than 66 years was 53.2%. Younger patients presented with a more aggressive disease, more advanced Durie-Salmon stage (85.3% vs 73.5%; p=0.013), extramedullary disease (12.7% vs 0%; p<0.001), osteolytic lesions (78.7% vs 57.6%; p<0.001) and bone plasmacytoma (25.3% vs 11.4%; p=0.003). In spite of this, the overall response rate was similar between groups (80.6% vs 81.4%; p=0.866). The overall survival was significantly longer in young patients (median, 65 months vs 41 months; p=0.001) and higher in those who received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The main cause of death was disease progression in both groups. Multivariable analysis revealed that creatinine ≥2mg/dl, extramedullary disease, ≤very good partial remission and non-autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are independent risk factors for shorter survival.
Conclusion
Although multiple myeloma patients younger than 66 years of age have an aggressive presentation, this did not translate into an inferior overall survival, particularly in those undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Abstract: Background
In Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) models, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are elevated and have been implicated in genomic instability, JAK2/STAT signaling amplification, and disease progression. Although the potential effects of ROS on the MPN phenotype, the effects of ruxolitinib treatment on ROS regulation have been poorly explored. Herein, we have reported the impact of ruxolitinib on redox signaling transcriptional network, and the effects of diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a pan NOX inhibitor, in JAK2V617F-driven cellular models.
Method
Redox signaling-related genes were investigated in SET2 cells upon ruxolitinib treatment by RNA-seq (GEO accession GSE69827). SET2 and HEL cells, which represent JAK2V617F-positive MPN cellular models with distinct sensitivity to apoptosis induced by ruxolitinib, were used. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT, apoptosis by annexin V/PI and flow cytometry, and cell signaling by quantitative PCR and Western blot.
Main results
Ruxolitinib impacted on a network composed of redox signaling-related genes, and DUOX1 and DUOX2 were identified as potential modulators of ruxolitinib response. In SET2 and HEL cells, DPI reduced cell viability and, at low doses, it significantly potentiated ruxolitinib-induced apoptosis. In the molecular scenario, DPI inhibited STAT3, STAT5 and S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation and induced PARP1 cleavage in JAK2V617F-positive cells. DPI combined with ruxolitinib increased PARP1 cleavage in SET2 cells and potentiated ruxolitinib-reduced STAT3, STAT5 and S6 ribosomal protein in HEL cells.
Conclusion
Our study reveals a potential adaptation mechanism for resistance against ruxolitinib by transcriptionally reprogramming redox signaling in JAK2V617F cells and exposes redox vulnerabilities with therapeutic value in MPN cellular models.

Abstract: Background
Matched donor (MD) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is currently the preferred choice of treatment for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) patients who have achieved complete remission. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of allo-HSCTs from different donor types for Ph+ ALL patients who received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
Methods
Studies in EMBASE and MEDLINE between inception and December 2020 were identified using search terms related to “Ph+ ALL” and “HSCT.” Eligible studies were studies with Ph+ ALL patients who received a TKI and allo-HSCT. The primary outcomes of interest—the overall survival (OS) or relapse-free survival (RFS)—needed to be reported. The Mantel–Haenszel method was used to combine the effect estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of each donor type.
Results
Fourteen cohort studies were identified for the meta-analysis. Haploidentical (HID)-HSCT for Ph+ ALL patients resulted in a superior RFS to MD-HSCT, with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.05–2.32; I2 = 0%). However, HID-HSCT and MD-HSCT had comparable OS. Furthermore, HID-HSCT group had a significantly lower relapse rate than MD-HSCT group. On the other hand, the risks of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) were higher for HID-HSCT and pooled OR of chronic GvHD rate. The OS and RFS of matched sibling-HSCT, matched unrelated-HSCT, and cord blood-HSCT were comparable with those of HID-HSCT.
Conclusion
This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that HID-HSCT is as effective as MD-HSCT in Ph+ ALL patients.

Abstract: Introduction
Multiple cause of death methodology enhances mortality studies beyond the traditional underlying cause of death approach. Aim: This study aims to describe causes of death and mortality issues related to haemophilia with the use of multiple-cause-of-death methodology. Methods: Annual male haemophilia mortality data was extracted from the public multiple-cause-of-death databases of the Mortality Information System, searching deaths included in rubrics D66 “hereditary factor VIII deficiency” (haemophilia A), and D67 “hereditary factor IX deficiency” (Haemophilia B) of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, and processed by the Multiple Cause Tabulator. Results: In Brazil, from 1999 to 2016, a total of 927 male deaths related to haemophilia occurred during the 18 year period, of which 418 (45,1 %) as underlying cause, and 509 (54,9 %) as associated cause of death. The leading associated cause of 418 deaths of haemophilia as underlying cause was hemorrhage (52.6%), half of which intracranial hemorrhage. Infectious and parasitic diseases accounted for 40,5% as the underlying causes of 509 deaths where haemophilia was an associated cause, where human immunodeficiency virus disease prevailed, however falling from 37,0% to 19.7%, and viral hepatitis increased from 6.0% to 7.9%; diseases of the circulatory system, increased from 13.5% to 18.4%, including intracranial hemorrhage from 5.7% to 7.0%, and neoplasms, from 8,5% to 13.2%, respectively from 1999-2007 to 2008-2016, followed as main underlying causes. Conclusion: Hemorrhages, mainly intracranial hemorrhage, human immunodeficiency virus disease, and viral hepatitis are the chief prevention goals aiming at the control of haemophilia mortality.

Abstract: Radiative sky cooling is a passive cooling method to obtain the sub-ambient cooling phenomenon by dissipating waste heat into the cold outer universe, relying on the transparent atmospheric window (i.e., 8–13 μm). In recent years, radiative sky cooling has drawn much attention from the fields of engineering to materials due to its potential for energy-saving and low-carbon applications. Generally, an emitter that has high solar reflectivity and emits selectively within the whole atmospheric window is the best candidate for sub-ambient radiative sky cooling that can achieve a low cooling temperature. Here, we proposed a novel selective emissivity spectrum for radiative sky cooling based on the finding that there exists a large transmittance drop within the atmospheric window and this drop will harm radiative sky cooling process, breaking the inherent cognition of the optimal spectrum of the emitter. A theoretical analysis was conducted to predict the radiative sky cooling performance of the emitter with the novel spectrum, and the performance comparison to traditional ideal selective emitter has been demonstrated in terms of sub-ambient cooling temperature and maximum cooling power. Moreover, the underlying reasons and effective application conditions were discussed in detail. In addition, the effect of the parasitic cooling loss process and content of O3 on the cooling performance of our proposed spectrum was investigated as well. In summary, this study provides a new thinking for designing spectrally selective emitters for obtaining remarkable lower cooling temperatures.

Abstract: Background
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by malignant clonal disorder of blood cells with high relapse rate and low survival rate. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have shown their important regulatory roles in AML progression. Here, we intended to disclose the role of circular RNA protein tyrosine kinase 2 (circ-PTK2) in the progression of AML and illustrate the potential working mechanisms.
Methods
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and colony formation assay were conducted to analyze cell proliferation ability, and the apoptosis rate was assessed by flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to validate the direct interaction between microRNA-330-5p (miR-330-5p) and circ-PTK2 or forkhead box M1 (FOXM1).
Results
Circ-PTK2 was highly expressed in AML. Circ-PTK2 interference suppressed the proliferation and triggered the apoptosis of AML cells. Circ-PTK2 directly bound to miR-330-5p. Si-circ-PTK2-mediated inhibition on the malignant behaviors of AML cells was partly counteracted by the addition of anti-miR-330-5p. MiR-330-5p directly interacted with FOXM1 messenger RNA (mRNA), and FOXM1 overexpression partly reversed miR-330-5p-induced influence in AML cells. Circ-PTK2 up-regulated FOXM1 expression through sponging miR-330-5p in AML cells.
Conclusion
Circ-PTK2 promoted the proliferation and hampered the apoptosis of AML cells through targeting miR-330-5p/FOXM1 axis.

Abstract: The 90 kDa heat shock protein, Hsp90, is involved in the conformational stabilization and functional maturation of diverse cancer-promoting proteins. To date, more than 300 Hsp90 clients have identified, suggesting that Hsp90 plays a central role in deciding cancer cell fate. In this study, we present the nuclear functions of Hsp90 in regulating the E2F-dependent gene transcription. We show that the conformation specific Hsp90 inhibitor, 17AAG decreases the total cellular E2F levels more selectively in cancer cells than transformed cells. With the help of coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we show that Hsp90 interacts with E2F1 and E2F2 in cancer cells, whereas in transformed cells, only E2F1 interacts with Hsp90. Retention of E2F2 in the nucleus of cancer cells upon MG132 combination with 17AAG has suggested that Hsp90 is required for E2F2 stability and function. The HDAC6 inhibitor tubacin treatment did not interfere with E2F1/2 stability and nuclear accumulation. However, the HDAC3 inhibitor, RGFP966 treatment, decreased nuclear E2F1/2 and its target gene expression. The nuclear accumulation of E2F1 and E2F2 upon cell cycle inhibition correlated with decreased acetylated Hsp90. We expose the nuclear functions of Hsp90 in facilitating the cell cycle progression through stabilizing E2F1/2.

Abstract: Solar-driven interfacial steam generation is a promising method to produce potable water using renewable energy and help solve global clean water scarcity problems. However, the design of photothermal materials (PTMs) with excellent light absorption that can localize heat at the air/water interface, and facilitate water vapor generation remains a key challenge for its practical implementation. In this work, we demonstrate the synthesis of heterostructure microflowers composed of vertically aligned CuS/Sn2S3 nanosheets (3D CSS-NS MF) using a single-step solvothermal method for solar steam generation application. The microflower structures and the abundant nanocavities between the vertically aligned nanosheets resulted in significant sunlight harvesting over the solar spectrum, excellent heat localization through trapping and re-absorbing the heat, and fast escape of water vapor. Under 1 sun (1 kW m-2) illumination, a high water evaporation rate of 1.42 kg m-2 h-1, corresponding to an efficiency of 82.93% was obtained. The 3D CSS-NS MF based solar evaporator exhibited remarkable salt ions rejection efficiency and good reusability over 10 cycles. Furthermore, efficient removal of organic dyes was observed in application geared towards wastewater treatment with a rejection ∼99.9%. Our work demonstrates the potential of using novel semiconductor-based nanocomposites as effective photothermal materials for high-performance solar steam generation in water desalination and wastewater treatment applications.

Abstract: Fanconi anemia (FA) is associated with bone marrow failure. Bone marrow (BM) from patients with FA and fanca−/− and fancc−/− mice are deficient in hematopoietic stem (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HPCs). Decreased HSCs/HPCs compromise their use in human and mouse hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and gene therapy to correct genetic defects causing FA. We reported increased collection of HSCs from mouse bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood, and human cord blood of normal donors after collection/processing in low (3%) oxygen (physioxia). We assessed comparative contents of long-term (LT)-HSCs from BM of fanca−/− and fancc−/− when collected/processed at 3% O2, in order to negate effects of extra physiological shock stress (EPHOSS) induced by collection/processing in ambient air. Collection/processing of BM from fanca−/− and fancc−/− mice in physioxia demonstrated a ≥3-fold increase in LT-HSCs compared to that in ambient air. This was associated with decreased phenotypic multipotential progenitor cells and functional granulocyte macrophage, erythroid, and multi-potential progenitors, results similar to that for BM from normal donor mice. Increased collection of HSCs could have clinical applicability for gene therapy and HCT.

Abstract: A purification protocol of molten MgCl2-NaCl-KCl (MNK) by adding active metals has been proposed to reduce the corrosion of alloy materials in the application of generation III concentrating solar power plants. In this work, the ionic transport properties and micro structural characteristics of metals (Mg, Na, and K) and molten MNK mixtures (metal-MNK) are investigated at 723 K by first principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations. According to the evolution of total energy, the Mg-MNK is the most stable mixture, while the Na-MNK mixture has larger energy fluctuations resulting in a higher specific heat capacity. Studies have shown that the small amount of metal existing in the molten MNK has almost no effect on the ionic diffusion order, but total diffusion coefficients and thermal conductivities of metal-MNK mixtures are improved. Meanwhile, the intensity of diffracted light of molten MNK is weakened by metals, and the microstructures of molten MNK added with alkali metals are more susceptible than that with metallic Mg by analyzing the total and partial static structure factors. Furthermore, the intermediate range orders of metal-MNK are demonstrated, especially for Mg-Mg pairs hinting the formation of the Mg2+-void-Mg2+ structure or Mg2+-centered clusters. Overall, the FPMD results deeply elaborate the dynamic interactions of molten MNK and metallic particles, which give insights for the development of salt purification and corrosion inhibition technology.

Abstract: Background
Severe von Willebrand disease (VWD) may be associated with chronic joint damage and may require prophylactic therapy. Emicizumab is a humanized bispecific antibody, which mimics the function of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), and it has been approved for prophylaxis in hemophilia A.
Methods
This is the first study assessing the potential future role of emicizumab as an alternative prophylactic treatment in patients with severe VWD, based upon a thrombin generation (TG) ex vivo analysis. We report 51 weeks of successful off label emicizumab prophylaxis in a child with severe VWD and recurrent hemarthroses and progressive arthropathy despite adherence to previous prophylaxis with replacement therapy.
Results and conclusions
Our work demonstrated that ex vivo spiking with emicizumab increased TG in plasma from patients with type 3 VWD. Similar TG results were observed in our treated patient, whose therapy was well tolerated without any adverse events. Both in vitro and ex vivo TG data support sufficient hemostasis without exceeding the range seen in healthy volunteers. Further collaborative studies on the efficacy and safety of emicizumab prophylaxis in severe VWD is warranted.
