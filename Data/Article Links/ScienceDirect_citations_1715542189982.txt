Abstract: The zebrafish, Danio rerio, is a well-established, invaluable model system for the study of human cancers. The genetic pathways that drive oncogenesis are highly conserved between zebrafish and humans, and multiple unique attributes of the zebrafish make it a tractable tool for analyzing the underlying cellular processes that give rise to human disease. In particular, the high conservation between human and zebrafish hematopoiesis (Jing & Zon, 2011) has stimulated the development of zebrafish models for human hematopoietic malignancies to elucidate molecular pathogenesis and to expedite the preclinical investigation of novel therapies. While T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the first transgenic cancer model in zebrafish (Langenau et al., 2003), a wide spectrum of zebrafish models of human hematopoietic malignancies has been established since 2003, largely through transgenesis and genome-editing approaches. This chapter presents key examples that validate the zebrafish as an indispensable model system for the study of hematopoietic malignancies and highlights new models that demonstrate recent advances in the field.

Abstract: Summary
The multidomain scaffolding protein Scribble (Scrib) organizes key signaling complexes to specify basolateral cell polarity and suppress aberrant growth. In many human cancers, genetically normal Scrib mislocalizes from cell-cell junctions to the cytosol, correlating with enhanced growth signaling and malignancy. Here we confirm that expression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transcription factor (EMT-TF) Snail in benign epithelial cells leads to Scrib displacement from the plasma membrane, mimicking the mislocalization observed in aggressive cancers. Upon further examination, Snail promotes a transcriptional program that targets genes in the palmitoylation cycle, repressing many protein acyl transferases and elevating expression and activity of protein acyl thioesterase 2 (APT2). APT2 isoform-selective inhibition or knockdown rescued Scrib membrane localization and palmitoylation while attenuating MEK activation. Overall, inhibiting APT2 restores balance to the Scrib palmitoylation cycle, promoting membrane re-localization and growth attenuation. These findings emphasize the importance of S-palmitoylation as a post-translational gatekeeper of cell polarity-mediated tumor suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Antibiotic-mediated microbiota destruction and the consequent loss of colonization resistance can result in intestinal domination with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), leading to bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients. Clearance of VRE remains a challenging goal that, if achieved, would reduce systemic VRE infections and patient-to-patient transmission. Although obligate anaerobic commensal bacteria have been associated with colonization resistance to VRE, the specific bacterial species involved remain undefined. Herein, we demonstrate that a precisely defined consortium of commensal bacteria containing the Clostridium cluster XIVa species Blautia producta and Clostridium bolteae restores colonization resistance against VRE and clears VRE from the intestines of mice. While C. bolteae did not directly mediate VRE clearance, it enabled intestinal colonization with B. producta, which directly inhibited VRE growth. These findings suggest that therapeutic or prophylactic administration of defined bacterial consortia to individuals with compromised microbiota composition may reduce inter-patient transmission and intra-patient dissemination of highly antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis B viruses (HBVs), which are enveloped viruses with reverse-transcribed DNA genomes, constitute the family Hepadnaviridae. An outstanding feature of HBVs is their streamlined genome organization with extensive gene overlap. Remarkably, the ∼1,100 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding the envelope proteins is fully nested within the ORF of the viral replicase P. Here, we report the discovery of a diversified family of fish viruses, designated nackednaviruses, which lack the envelope protein gene, but otherwise exhibit key characteristics of HBVs including genome replication via protein-primed reverse-transcription and utilization of structurally related capsids. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that these two virus families separated more than 400 million years ago before the rise of tetrapods. We show that HBVs are of ancient origin, descending from non-enveloped progenitors in fishes. Their envelope protein gene emerged de novo, leading to a major transition in viral lifestyle, followed by co-evolution with their hosts over geologic eras.

Abstract: There are different views of how the immune system participates in the reaction to cancer. Here, we evaluated expression of DAMP proteins HSP70 and cancer-testis antigen SPAG9 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung cancer to explore tumor immunity. Our analysis showed that levels of HSP70 and SPAG9 antibody were significantly higher in the serum of lung cancer and HCC patients than in the serum of healthy subjects (P < 0.001), but there were no differences in levels of HSP70 antibody in patients and controls. Levels of serum SPAG9 antibody in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients were significantly higher than in treated lung cancer patients (P < 0.05), but there were no differences in levels of HSP70 or HSP70 antibody. Levels of serum HSP70 and SPAG9 antibody, but not HSP70 antibody, were also higher in hepatitis/cirrhosis patients than in healthy subjects (P = 0.005, P < 0.001). Levels of serum SPAG9 antibody were significantly higher in HCC patients than in hepatitis/cirrhosis patients, but there were no differences in HSP70 or HSP70 antibody levels. Finally, levels of serum HSP70 and SPAG9 antibody were significantly higher in HCC patients than in lung cancer patients (P < 0.05, P < 0.001). These results indicate that cancer-testis antigen SPAG9 induces a strong humoral immune response in cancer patients but HSP70 does not. These results show that SPAG9 has potential as a tumor-specific biomarker.

Abstract: Summary
Myelomeningocele (MMC) is a congenital disease without genetic abnormalities. Neurological symptoms are irreversibly impaired after birth, and no effective treatment has been reported to date. Only surgical repairs have been reported so far. In this study, we performed antenatal treatment of MMC with an artificial skin using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from a patient with Down syndrome (AF-T21-iPSCs) and twin-twin transfusion syndrome (AF-TTTS-iPSCs) to a rat model. We manufactured three-dimensional skin with epidermis generated from keratinocytes derived from AF-T21-iPSCs and AF-TTTS-iPSCs and dermis of human fibroblasts and collagen type I. For generation of epidermis, we developed a protocol using Y-27632 and epidermal growth factor. The artificial skin was successfully covered over MMC defect sites during pregnancy, implying a possible antenatal surgical treatment with iPSC technology.

Abstract: Summary
The structural complexity of glycosylation restrains the functional characterization of glycans. We present a versatile carbohydrate ligation technique based on the reaction of cyclic carbamates with primary amines. Cyclic-carbamate-derivatized carbohydrates can be added to primary amine-containing molecules in aqueous solution to yield glycoconjugates. This method enabled the presentation of carbohydrate epitopes on live animal cells, as shown by the acquisition of E-selectin binding sites on mouse MC-38 cells decorated with 3-fucosyllactose or 3-fucosyl-3-sialyllactose. Ligation of 3- and 6-sialyllactose to Escherichia coli demonstrated the importance of sialic acid linkages in regulating complement factor H binding. Proteins were modified with oligosaccharides to study their role in stimulating cytokine secretion by dendritic cells, thus pointing to interactions between glycoproteins and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling in controlling interleukin-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1β release. Overall, cyclic-carbamate-mediated ligation is useful to study the biology of carbohydrate epitopes on proteins and on cell membranes.

Abstract: Formins are multi domain proteins present ubiquitously in all eukaryotes from lower fungi to higher vertebrates. Formins are characterized by the presence of formin homology domain-2 (FH2) and formin homology domain-1 (FH1). There are fifteen different formins present in mouse and human. Among these metazoan formins, Delphilin is a unique formin having two PDZ domains at the N-terminus and FH1, FH2 domain at the C-terminus respectively. In this study we observed that Delphilin binds to actin filaments, and Delphilin inhibits actin filament elongation like barbed end capping protein CapZ. In vitro, Delphilin stabilized actin filaments by inhibiting actin filament depolymerisation. Therefore, our study demonstrates Delphilin as an actin-filament capping protein.

Abstract: Summary
We assessed the extent to which the publication of clinical trial results of innovative cell-based interventions reflects International Society for Stem Cell Research best practice guidelines. We assessed: (1) characteristics and time to publication of completed trials; (2) quality of reported trials; and (3) results of published trials. We identified and analyzed publications from 1,052 novel stem cell clinical trials: 179 (45.4%) of 393 completed trials had published results; 48 trials were registered by known stem cell tourism clinics, none of which reported results. Completed non-industry-sponsored trials initially published more rapidly, but differences with industry-sponsored trials decreased over time. Most publications reported safety, and 67.3% (mainly early-stage trials) reported positive outcomes. A higher proportion of industry trials reported positive efficacy. Heightened patient expectations for stem cell therapies give rise to ethical obligations for the transparent conduct of clinical trials. Reporting guidelines need to be developed that are specific to early-phase clinical trials.

Abstract: The 37kDa/67kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) is a non-integrin laminin receptor which is overexpressed in tumorigenic cells and supports progression of cancer via promoting metastasis, angiogenesis and telomerase activity and impediment of apoptosis. The present study investigates the role of LRP/LR on the metastatic potential of early (A375) and late (A375SM) stage malignant melanoma cells. Flow cytometry revealed that both early and late stage malignant melanoma cells display high levels of LRP/LR on their cell surface. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis showed that late stage malignant melanoma cells display significantly higher total and cell surface LRP/LR levels in comparison to early stage malignant melanoma cells and the poorly invasive breast cancer (MCF-7) control cell line. Targeting LRP/LR using the LRP/LR specific antibody IgG1-iS18 resulted in a significant reduction of the adhesive potential to laminin-1 and the invasive potential through the ‘ECM-simulating’ Matrigel™ of both early and late stage malignant melanoma cells. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation coefficient confirmed that increased LRP levels correlate with the increased invasive and adhesive potential in early and late stage melanoma cells. Thus, blocking LRP/LR using the IgG1-iS18 antibody may therefore be a promising therapeutic strategy for early and late stage malignant melanoma treatment.

The laminin-derived peptide C16 regulates GPNMB expression and function in breast cancer,

Abstract: Breast cancer is an important public health problem, and its progression may be related to the extracellular matrix (ECM), which acts as a structural scaffold and instruction source for neoplastic cells. Laminins are ECM proteins regulating tumor biology. The laminin-derived peptide C16 regulates different properties of tumor cells. Here we analyzed C16-induced differential gene expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. MCF-10A normal-like breast cells served as control. Among different cancer-related genes, C16 induced overexpression of GPNMB. This gene encodes a transmembrane protein GPNMB (glycoprotein non-metastatic B), involved with malignant phenotype of breast cancer cells. Immunoblot validated microarray results. To correlate gene and protein expression with cellular function, we investigated whether C16 would regulate invasion in breast cancer cells. siRNA experiments strongly suggested that C16 and GPNMB cooperate to regulate invasion of highly aggressive MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. We addressed regulatory mechanisms involved in C16-mediated increase of GPNMB protein levels in MDA-MB-231 cells, and observed that C16 stimulates β1 integrin and Src phosphorylation. Furthermore, Src inhibition decreases peptide-induced GPNMB expression levels. To contextualize in vivo our results in vitro, we addressed GPNMB immunostaining in breast cancer human tissue microarrays. Quantitative immunohistochemistry showed that GPNMB is significantly more expressed in breast cancer compared to normal tissue. We concluded that laminin-derived peptide C16 regulates gene and protein expression of GPNMB in breast cancer cells. C16 and GPNMB may cooperate to regulate invasion of highly aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells, probably through Src signaling. GPNMB presented increased expression in breast cancer in vivo compared to normal breast tissue.

Abstract: Oral cancer mortality and morbidity rates remain high. The main inducer of oral cancer is cigarette smoke (CS). Translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO) was shown to play a role in carcinogenesis. We characterized TSPO binding sites in human oral cancer cell line SCC-15 and examined effect of CS on TSPO binding. We exposed SCC-15 human squamous cells to cigarette smoke. [3H]PK 11195 binding results were assessed in cells confluent for one day. To characterize the number of population sites, a custom written Matlab program compared Pearson linear correlation coefficients between all points in the Scatchard plot. Using [3H]PK 11195 as a radio ligand, we found that TSPO binding sites are not uniform, but separated into two sub-populations, one with high affinity (respective Kd and Bmax values of 1.40±0.08nM and 1586±48 fmol/mg protein), another with lower affinity (respective Kd and Bmax values of 61±5nM and 26260±1050 fmol/mg protein). We demonstrate rapid decrease in TSPO binding to the high affinity site induced by exposure to CS; specifically, significant 36% decrease in binding after 30min CS exposure (p<0.05), and 69% decrease after 2h CS exposure (p<0.05). Association between TSPO and CS exposure may contribute to understanding the underlying mechanism of oral carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Transport of therapeutic agents across epithelial barriers is an important element in drug delivery. Transepithelial flux is widely used as a measure of transit across an epithelium, however it is most typically employed as a relative as opposed to absolute measure of molecular movement. Here, we have used the calcium switch approach to measure the maximum rate of paracellular flux through unencumbered intercellular junctions as a method to calibrate the flux rates for a series of tracers ranging in 0.6–900kDa in size across barriers composed of human colon epithelial (Caco-2) cells. We then examined the effects of nanostructured films (NSFs) on transepithelial transport. Two different NSF patterns were used, Defined Nanostructure (DN) 2 imprinted on polypropylene (PP) and DN3 imprinted on polyether ether ketone (PEEK). NSFs made direct contact with cells and decreased their barrier function, as measured by transepithelial resistance (TER), however cell viability was not affected. When NSF-induced transepithelial transport of Fab fragment (55kDa) and IgG (160kDa) was measured, it was unexpectedly found to be significantly greater than the maximum paracellular rate as predicted using cells cultured in low calcium. These data suggested that NSFs stimulate an active transport pathway, most likely transcytosis, in addition to increasing paracellular flux. Transport of IgG via transcytosis was confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, since NSFs induced a significant level of IgG endocytosis by Caco-2 cells. Thus, NSF-induced IgG flux was attributable to both transcytosis and the paracellular route. These data provide the first demonstration that transcytosis can be stimulated by NSFs and that this was concurrent with increased paracellular permeability. Moreover, NSFs with distinct architecture paired with specific substrates have the potential to provide an effective means to regulate transepithelial transport in order to optimize drug delivery.

Abstract: Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins constitute a large protein family that is closely associated with resistance to abiotic stresses in multiple organisms and protect cells against drought and other stresses. Azotobacter vinelandii is a soil bacterium that forms desiccation-resistant cysts. This bacterium possesses two genes, here named lea1 and lea2, coding for avLEA1 and avLEA2 proteins, both containing 20-mer motifs characteristic of eukaryotic plant LEA proteins. In this study, we found that disruption of the lea1 gene caused a loss of the cysts’ viability after 3 months of desiccation, whereas at 6 months, wild-type or lea2 mutant strain cysts remained viable. Vegetative cells of the lea1 mutant were more sensitive to osmotic stress; cysts developed by this mutant were also more sensitive to high temperatures than cysts or vegetative cells of the wild type or of the lea2 mutant. Expression of lea1 was induced several fold during encystment. In addition, the protective effects of these proteins were assessed in Escherichia coli cells. We found that E. coli cells overexpressing avLEA1 were more tolerant to salt stress than control cells; finally, in vitro analysis showed that avLEA1 protein was able to prevent the freeze thaw-induced inactivation of lactate dehydrogenase. In conclusion, avLEA1 is essential for the survival of A. vinelandii in dry conditions and for protection against hyper-osmolarity, two major stress factors that bacteria must cope with for survival in the environment. This is the first report on the role of bacterial LEA proteins on the resistance of cysts to desiccation.

Abstract: Summary
Microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) are some of the clinically most successful anti-cancer drugs. Unfortunately, instances of multidrug resistances to MTA have been reported, which highlights the need for developing MTAs with different mechanistic properties. One less explored class of MTAs are [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines (TPs). These cytotoxic compounds are microtubule-stabilizing agents that inexplicably bind to vinblastine binding site on tubulin, which is typically targeted by microtubule-destabilizing agents. Here we used cellular, biochemical, and structural biology approaches to address this apparent discrepancy. Our results establish TPs as vinca-site microtubule-stabilizing agents that promote longitudinal tubulin contacts in microtubules, in contrast to classical microtubule-stabilizing agents that primarily promote lateral contacts. Additionally we observe that TPs studied here are not affected by p-glycoprotein overexpression, and suggest that TPs are promising ligands against multidrug-resistant cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are characterized by the pluripotent capacity to generate all embryonic lineages. Here, we show that ESCs can occupy a spectrum of distinct transcriptional and epigenetic states in response to varied extrinsic conditions. This spectrum broadly corresponds to a developmental continuum of pluripotency and is coupled with a gradient of increasing global DNA methylation. Each pluripotent state is linked with activation of distinct classes of transposable elements (TEs), which in turn influence ESCs through generating chimeric transcripts. Moreover, varied ESC culture parameters differentially license heterogeneous activation of master lineage regulators, including Sox1, Gata4, or Blimp1, and influence differentiation. Activation of Blimp1 is prevalent in 2i (without LIF) conditions, and marks a dynamic primordial germ cell (PGC)-like sub-state that is directly repressed by Klf4 downstream of LIF/STAT3 signaling. Thus, extrinsic cues establish a spectrum of pluripotent states, in part by modulating sub-populations, as well as directing the transcriptome, epigenome, and TE.

Recent success in functional recovery by photoreceptor precursor transplantation in dysfunctional retina has led to an increased interest in using embryonic stem cell (ESC) or induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal progenitors to treat retinal degeneration. However, cell-based therapies for end-stage degenerative retinas that have lost the outer nuclear layer (ONL) are still a big challenge. In the present study, by transplanting mouse iPSC-derived retinal tissue (miPSC retina) in the end-stage retinal-degeneration model (rd1), we visualized the direct contact between host bipolar cell terminals and the presynaptic terminal of graft photoreceptors by gene labeling, showed light-responsive behaviors in transplanted rd1 mice, and recorded responses from the host retina with transplants by ex vivo micro-electroretinography and ganglion cell recordings using a multiple-electrode array system. Our data provides a proof of concept for transplanting ESC/iPSC retinas to restore vision in end-stage retinal degeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), the main constituent of PML nuclear bodies, regulates various physiological processes in different cell types. However, little is known about its functions in embryonic stem cells (ESC). Here, we report that PML contributes to ESC self-renewal maintenance by controlling cell-cycle progression and sustaining the expression of crucial pluripotency factors. Transcriptomic analysis and gain- or loss-of-function approaches showed that PML-deficient ESC exhibit morphological, metabolic, and growth properties distinct to naive and closer to the primed pluripotent state. During differentiation of embryoid bodies, PML influences cell-fate decisions between mesoderm and endoderm by controlling the expression of Tbx3. PML loss compromises the reprogramming ability of embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells by inhibiting the transforming growth factor β pathway at the very early stages. Collectively, these results designate PML as a member of the regulatory network for ESC naive pluripotency and somatic cell reprogramming.

Abstract: Cell and tissue mechanical properties are paramount in controlling morphogenesis. Microaspiration techniques allow measuring the absolute values of mechanical properties in space and time in vivo. Here, we explain how to build a microaspiration setup that can be used for both cellular and tissue scale measurements. At the cellular scale, microaspiration allows the mapping in space and time of surface tensions of individual interfaces within a tissue to understand the forces shaping it. At the tissue scale, microaspiration can be used to measure macroscopic mechanical properties such as the viscoelasticity and tissue surface tension that regulate the dynamics of tissue deformation. Based on a simple and cost-effective apparatus, these two complementary microaspiration techniques provide unique tools for exploring cell and tissue mechanics in vivo.

Abstract: Monocytes ensure proper functioning and maintenance of epithelial cells, while good condition of monocytes is a key factor of these interactions. Although, it was shown that in some circumstances, a population of altered monocytes may appear, there is no data regarding their effect on epithelial cells. In this study, using direct co-culture model with LPS-activated and Dox-induced senescent THP-1 monocytes, we reported for the first time ROS-induced DNA damage, reduced metabolic activity, proliferation inhibition and cell cycle arrest followed by p16-, p21- and p27-mediated DNA damage response pathways activation, premature senescence and apoptosis induction in HeLa cells. Also, we show that klotho protein possessing anti-aging and anti-inflammatory characteristics reduced cytotoxic and genotoxic events by inhibition of insulin/IGF-IR and downregulation of TRF1 and TRF2 proteins. Therefore, klotho protein could be considered as a protective factor against changes caused by altered monocytes in epithelial cells.

Abstract: ROR-alpha is a nuclear receptor, activity of which can be modulated by natural or synthetic ligands. Due to its possible involvement in, and potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis, we aimed to identify ROR-alpha target genes in monocytic and endothelial cell lines. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by tiling array (ChIP-on-chip) for ROR-alpha in monocytic cell line THP1 and endothelial cell line HUVEC. Following bioinformatic analysis of the array data, we tested four candidate genes in terms of dependence of their expression level on ligand-mediated ROR-alpha activity, and two of them in terms of promoter occupancy by ROR-alpha. Bioinformatic analyses of ChIP-on-chip data suggested that ROR-alpha binds to genomic regions near the transcription start site (TSS) of more than 3000 genes in THP1 and HUVEC. Potential ROR-alpha target genes in both cell types seem to be involved mainly in membrane receptor activity, signal transduction and ion transport. While SPP1 and IKBKA were shown to be direct target genes of ROR-alpha in THP1 monocytes, inflammation related gene HMOX1 and heat shock protein gene HSPA8 were shown to be potential target genes of ROR-alpha. Our results suggest that ROR-alpha may regulate signaling receptor activity, and transmembrane transport activity through its potential target genes. ROR-alpha seems also to play role in cellular sensitivity to environmental substances like arsenite and chloroprene. Although, the expression analyses have shown that synthetic ROR-alpha ligands can modulate some of potential ROR-alpha target genes, functional significance of ligand-dependent modulation of gene expression needs to be confirmed with further analyses.

Abstract: Obtaining and manipulating neuronal cells are critical for neural biology basic mechanism studies and translational applications. Recent advances in protocol development and mechanism dissections have made direct induction of neuronal cells from other somatic cells (iN) a promising strategy for such purposes. In this study, we established a protocol to expand a population of fibroblast-like cells from adult human retinal tissues, which can be reprogrammed into iNs by forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors. Interestingly, the combination of Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1l, and NeuroD1 transcription factors, which has been demonstrated to be sufficient to reprogram human embryonic and dermal fibroblasts into iNs, failed to reprogram the fibroblast-like cells from human retinas into iNs. Instead, supplementing Ascl1 with Pax6 sufficed to convert the cells into iNs, which exhibited a typical neuronal morphology, expressed neural marker genes, displayed active and passive neuronal membrane activities, and made synaptic communications with other neurons. Moreover, iNs converted from retina-derived fibroblast-like cells contained high ratios of γ-Aminobutyric acid- (GABA-) and tyrosine hydroxylase- (TH-) positive neurons. Thus, the present study proposes a protocol that makes use of discarded retinal tissues from eye banks for iN generation, and suggests that different sources of somatic cells require different iN induction recipes and may also affect the iN subtype outputs. Our study may also facilitate the future development of methods to convert resident cells in situ into retinal neurons for treating retinal degeneration disease purpose.

Abstract: The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 is best characterized by its ability to downregulate inflammation and promote peripheral tolerance. On the other hand, IL-10 was also found to maintain the effector response of CD8+ T cells and promote the expansion of tumor-resident CD8+ T cells. In diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the role of IL-10 has been characterized in tumor cells but not in CD8+ T cells. We found that CD8+ T cells in DLBCL presented robust interferon (IFN)-γ expression early during TCR-activation but could not maintain this response later on, which was characterized by significantly lower CD8+ T cell degranulation and higher apoptosis. These observations were associated with higher PD-1 expression in DLBCL CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, the PD-1+ cells were strongly enriched in the IFN-γ+, but not the IFN-γ−, fraction. Interestingly, exogenous IL-10 significantly improved the survival of DLBCL CD8+ T cells, and resulted in significantly higher IFN-γ, ganzyme A and granzyme B expression in the absence of CD19+ tumor cells, and significantly improved CD8+ T cell-mediated specific lysis of CD19+ tumor cells. IL-10 did not alter the expression of PD-1 in DLBCL CD8+ T cells, but curiously, IL-10-treated DLBCL CD8+ T cells were less susceptible to PD-L1-mediated apoptosis. We then demonstrated that IL-10 treatment significantly elevated the expression of pro-survival factor Bcl-2. Blocking IL-10 resulted in higher apoptosis, fewer IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells, and lower Bcl-2 expression. IL-10 also significantly increased STAT3, but not STAT1, phosphorylation in CD8+ T cells. Together, these results suggested that IL-10 could enhance CD8+ T cell inflammation in DLBCL patients.

Abstract: The Hsp70/Hsp90 organising protein (HOP) is a co-chaperone essential for client protein transfer from Hsp70 to Hsp90 within the Hsp90 chaperone machine. Although HOP is upregulated in various cancers, there is limited information from in vitro studies on how HOP expression is regulated in cancer. The main objective of this study was to identify the HOP promoter and investigate its activity in cancerous cells. Bioinformatic analysis of the −2500 to +16 bp region of the HOP gene identified a large CpG island and a range of putative cis-elements. Many of the cis-elements were potentially bound by transcription factors which are activated by oncogenic pathways. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the upstream region of the HOP gene contains an active promoter in vitro. Truncation of this region suggested that the core HOP promoter region was −855 to +16 bp. HOP promoter activity was highest in Hs578T, HEK293T and SV40- transformed MEF1 cell lines which expressed mutant or inactive p53. In a mutant p53 background, expression of wild-type p53 led to a reduction in promoter activity, while inhibition of wild-type p53 in HeLa cells increased HOP promoter activity. Additionally, in Hs578T and HEK293T cell lines containing inactive p53, expression of HRAS increased HOP promoter activity. However, HRAS activation of the HOP promoter was inhibited by p53 overexpression. These findings suggest for the first time that HOP expression in cancer may be regulated by both RAS activation and p53 inhibition. Taken together, these data suggest that HOP may be part of the cancer gene signature induced by a combination of mutant p53 and mutated RAS that is associated with cellular transformation.

Abstract: Cross-talk between hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is essential for HSCs regulation and leukemogenesis. Studying bone marrow of myelodysplasia patients, a pre-leukemic condition, we found mRNA overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in CD34+ HSCs and semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) in BMSCs. To better understand the role of VEGFA and SEMA3A in leukemogenesis, we recruited 30 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, 29 acute myeloid leukemia (6 secondary to MDS) patients and 12 controls. We found higher VEGFA expression in de novo AML patients (without prior MDS) group (p=0.0073) and higher SEMA3A expression in all BMSCs patient's samples compared to control group. We then overexpressed VEGFA in an acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, KG1 cells, and in normal CD34+ cells. This overexpression increased KG1 (p=0.045) and CD34+ cell (p=0.042) viability and KG1 (p=0.042) and CD34+ cell (p=0.047) proliferation. Moreover, KG1 and CD34+ cells overexpressing VEGFA also had increased proliferation when co-cultured with human marrow stromal HS5 cells (p=0.045 and p=0.02, respectively). However, co-culture of these transformed cells with HS5 cells overexpressing SEMA3A reduced KG1 (p=0.004) and CD34+ (p=0.009) proliferation. Co-culture of KG1 transformed cells with HS27 cells overexpressing SEMA3A reduced KG1 proliferation as well (p=0.01). To investigate whether the dominant SEMA3A effect over VEGFA could be due to competition for neuropilin1 receptor (NRP1), we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-NRP1 antibody of cell extracts of co-cultured KG1 and HS5 cells, induced or not by VEGFA and SEMA3A recombinant proteins. Results showed a preferential association of NRP1 with SEMA3A, suggesting that SEMA3A can partially reverse the effects caused by the VEGFA preventing its binding with the NRP1 receptor. Since both hematopoietic cells, leukemic and normal, showed similar behavior, we suppose that the attempt to reversion of VEGF effects by SEMA3A is a homeostatic phenomenon in the hematopoietic niche. Finally, we conclude that VEGFA overexpression confers AML cell advantages and SEMA3A may partially reverse this effect; thus, SEMA3A protein combined with VEGFA inhibitors could be beneficial for AML treatment.

Abstract: Linking cellular structure and function has always been a key goal of microscopy, but obtaining high resolution spatial and temporal information from the same specimen is a fundamental challenge. Two-photon (2P) microscopy allows imaging deep inside intact tissue, bringing great insight into the structural and functional dynamics of cells in their physiological environment. At the nanoscale, the complex ultrastructure of a cell's environment in tissue can be reconstructed in three dimensions (3D) using serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). This provides a snapshot of high resolution structural information pertaining to the shape, organization, and localization of multiple subcellular structures at the same time. The pairing of these two imaging modalities in the same specimen provides key information to relate cellular dynamics to the ultrastructural environment. Until recently, approaches to relocate a region of interest (ROI) in tissue from 2P microscopy for SBF-SEM have been inefficient or unreliable. However, near-infrared branding (NIRB) overcomes this by using the laser from a multiphoton microscope to create fiducial markers for accurate correlation of 2P and electron microscopy (EM) imaging volumes. The process is quick and can be user defined for each sample. Here, to increase the efficiency of ROI relocation, multiple NIRB marks are used in 3D to target ultramicrotomy. A workflow is described and discussed to obtain a data set for 3D correlated light and electron microscopy, using three different preparations of brain tissue as examples.

Abstract: Defects in cellular protein homeostasis are associated with many severe and prevalent pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, muscle dystrophies, and metabolic disorders. One way to counteract these defects is to improve the protein homeostasis capacity through induction of the heat shock response. Despite numerous attempts to develop strategies for chemical activation of the heat shock response by heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), the underlying mechanisms of drug candidates’ mode of action are poorly understood. To lower the threshold for the heat shock response activation, we used the chaperone co-inducer BGP-15 that was previously shown to have beneficial effects on several proteinopathic disease models. We found that BGP-15 treatment combined with heat stress caused a substantial increase in HSF1-dependent heat shock protein 70 (HSPA1A/B) expression already at a febrile range of temperatures. Moreover, BGP-15 alone inhibited the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs), thereby increasing chromatin accessibility at multiple genomic loci including the stress-inducible HSPA1A. Intriguingly, treatment with well-known potent HDAC inhibitors trichostatin A and valproic acid enhanced the heat shock response and improved cytoprotection. These results present a new pharmacological strategy for restoring protein homeostasis by inhibiting HDACs, increasing chromatin accessibility, and lowering the threshold for heat shock response activation.

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is the founding member of a family of transcription factors that function as master regulators of oxygen homeostasis. HIF-1 is composed of an O2-regulated HIF-1α subunit and a constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit. This review provides a compendium of proteins that interact with the HIF-1α subunit, many of which regulate HIF-1 activity in either an O2-dependent or O2-independent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) play multiple roles in protecting bacteria from host and environmental factors, and many commensal bacteria can produce multiple capsule types. To better understand the roles of different CPSs in competitive intestinal colonization, we individually expressed the eight different capsules of the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Certain CPSs were most advantageous in vivo, and increased anti-CPS immunoglobulin A correlated with increased fitness of a strain expressing one particular capsule, CPS5, suggesting that it promotes avoidance of adaptive immunity. A strain with the ability to switch between multiple capsules was more competitive than those expressing any single capsule except CPS5. After antibiotic perturbation, only the wild-type, capsule-switching strain remained in the gut, shifting to prominent expression of CPS5 only in mice with intact adaptive immunity. These data suggest that different capsules equip mutualistic gut bacteria with the ability to thrive in various niches, including those influenced by immune responses and antibiotic perturbations.

Abstract: Background
Capsular contracture is an incurable complication after silicone-based implant surgery. Myofibroblast is the predominant cell in the contracted capsule. We hypothesized that human adipose derive stromal cells (hASCs) together with fibroblast may show a similar phenotypic characteristics of myofibroblast after the treatment of inflammatory cytokines in vitro.
Materials and methods
Interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were treated in the culture of hASCs and HDFs. Lyn peptide inhibitor was applied as an inhibitor. The changes of cell surface markers (CD105, CD73, CD34, CD45, CD31, CD325 and CD146) were assessed. The expression of various cytokines related to wound contraction were tested such as TGF-β, α-SMA, HGF, FGF, ENT-1, and TSP-1. Myo-D, α-SMA, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were evaluated by blotting and immunocytochemical staining. The collagen-gel contraction assay was performed for the functional contraction of myofibroblastic phenotype.
Results
The expression of α-SMA, Myo-D and GFAP after the treatment of IL-3/GM-CSF showed similar results in hASCs and HDFs. Enhanced expression of TGF- β was observed in HDFs and the increase of ENT-1 and TSP-1 was significant in hASCs. Collagen-gel with HDFs contracted significantly within 24h after the treatment of IL-3/GM-CSF, and the contraction was inhibited by Lyn peptide inhibitor. But in hASCs, the gel-contraction was not significant.
Conclusion
IL-3/ GM-CSF effected on the myofibroblastic differentiation of hASCs as well as it did on HDFs. But hASCs did not show the phenotypic gel-contraction within 24h.

Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the Tg737 gene plays a critical role in the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, few systematic investigations have focused on the biological function of Tg737 in the invasion and migration of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) and on its clinical significance. In this study, Tg737 overexpression was achieved via gene transfection in MHCC97-H side population (SP) cells, which are considered a model for LCSCs in scientific studies. Tg737 overexpression significantly inhibited the invasion and migration of SP cells in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2)/matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)-dependent manner. Furthermore, Tg737 expression was frequently decreased in HCC tissues relative to that in adjacent noncancerous liver tissues. This decreased expression was significantly associated with tumor differentiation, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, metastasis, tumor size, vascular invasion, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, and tumor number. Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that Tg737 expression was an independent factor for predicting the overall survival of HCC patients. Notably, Kaplan–Meier analysis further showed that overall survival was significantly worse among patients with low Tg737 expression. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that Tg737 is a poor prognostic marker in patients with HCC, which may be due to its ability to promote LCSCs invasion and migration. These results provide a basis for investigating of Tg737 as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.

Abstract: In a previous transcriptomic analysis of 63 ocular melanomas of the uvea, we found that expression of the PRL-3/PTP4A3 gene, encoding a phosphatase that is anchored to the plasma membrane, was associated with the risk of metastasis, and a poor prognosis. We also showed that PRL-3 overexpression in OCM-1 ocular melanoma cells significantly increased cell migration in vitro and invasiveness in vivo, suggesting a direct role for PRL-3 in the metastatic spreading of uveal melanoma. Here, we aimed to identify PRL-3 substrates at the plasma membrane involved in adhesion to the extracellular matrix. We focused on integrin β1, which is the most highly expressed integrin in our cohort of uveal melanomas. We show that preventing PRL-3 anchorage to the plasma membrane i) abolishes PRL-3-induced migration in OCM-1 cells, ii) specifically enhances the spreading of OCM-1 cells overexpressing PRL-3, and iii) favors the maturation of large focal adhesions (FAs) containing integrin β1 on collagen I. Knockdown experiments confirmed integrin β1 involvement in PRL3-induced migration. We identified interactions between PRL-3 and integrin β1, as well as with FAK P-Y397, an auto-activated form of Focal Adhesion Kinase found in FAs. We also show that integrin β1 may be dephosphorylated by PRL-3 in its intracytoplasmic S/T region, an important motif for integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Finally, we observed that PRL-3 regulated the clustering of integrin β1 in FAs on collagen I but not on fibronectin. This work identifies PRL-3 as a new regulator of cell adhesion structures to the extracellular matrix, and further supports PRL-3 as a key actor of metastasis in uveal melanoma, of which molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood.

Abstract: Summary
A family of apicomplexa-specific proteins containing AP2 DNA-binding domains (ApiAP2s) was identified in malaria parasites. This family includes sequence-specific transcription factors that are key regulators of development. However, functions for the majority of ApiAP2 genes remain unknown. Here, a systematic knockout screen in Plasmodium berghei identified ten ApiAP2 genes that were essential for mosquito transmission: four were critical for the formation of infectious ookinetes, and three were required for sporogony. We describe non-essential functions for AP2-O and AP2-SP proteins in blood stages, and identify AP2-G2 as a repressor active in both asexual and sexual stages. Comparative transcriptomics across mutants and developmental stages revealed clusters of co-regulated genes with shared cis promoter elements, whose expression can be controlled positively or negatively by different ApiAP2 factors. We propose that stage-specific interactions between ApiAP2 proteins on partly overlapping sets of target genes generate the complex transcriptional network that controls the Plasmodium life cycle.

Abstract: Background
Age-related cataract is among the most common chronic disorders of ageing and the apoptosis of lens epithelial cells contributes to non-congenital cataract development. We amid to explore the role of TUG1 and miR-421 in the age-related cataract.
Methods
The expression level of TUG1, miR-421 and caspase-3 were detected by RT-qPCR. The apoptotic-related protein, caspase-3, Bax and blc-2 were analyzed by western blot. We performed ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to induce SAR01/04 cell apoptosis which was analyzed by flow cytometry. RIP pull-down and luciferase reporter assay were used to verified the combination and regulating among TUG1, miR-421 and caspase-3.
Results
Here, we observed that the expression level of TUG1 and caspase-3 in the anterior lens capsules of age-related cataract were significantly higher and miR-421 was significantly lower than that in the normal anterior lens capsules. The apoptosis-related protein, caspase-3, Bax and blc-2 were abnormal expression in the anterior lens capsules of age-related cataract tissue. Our data showed that the expression level of TUG1 and caspase-3 and cell apoptosis rate in SAR01/04 cells treated with UV irradiation was remarkably higher than that in the control. TUG1 negatively regulated miR-421 expression and promoted UV irradiation-induced SAR01/04 cell apoptosis. However, miR-421 inhibitor and pcDNA-caspase-3 could reverse the action of the SRA01/04 cell apoptosis by si-TUG1, which suggested TUG1 promoted UV irradiation-induced apoptosis through downregulating miR-421 expression. Furthermore, this study confirmed TUG1 could been in combination with miR-421, and TUG1 and caspase-3 were both a directly target of miR-421.
Conclusion
TUG1 modulated lens epithelial cell apoptosis through miR-421/caspase-3 axis. These findings will offer a novel insight into the pathogenesis of cataract.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells facilitates growth and proliferation. Increased activity of the serine biosynthetic pathway through the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) contributes to tumorigenesis. With a small substrate and a weak binding cofactor, (NAD+), inhibitor development for PHGDH remains challenging. Instead of targeting the PHGDH active site, we computationally identified two potential allosteric sites and virtually screened compounds that can bind to these sites. With subsequent characterization, we successfully identified PHGDH non-NAD+-competing allosteric inhibitors that attenuate its enzyme activity, selectively inhibit de novo serine synthesis in cancer cells, and reduce tumor growth in vivo. Our study not only identifies novel allosteric inhibitors for PHGDH to probe its function and potential as a therapeutic target, but also provides a general strategy for the rational design of small-molecule modulators of metabolic enzyme function.

Abstract: Heat stress proteins assist cellular proteins in the acquisition of native structure. The present research was conducted to study how thermo-tolerance is modulated by HSP90 and HSP70 gene polymorphism and its association with hemato-physio-biochemical parameters, supported by their expression profiles in Chokla, Magra, Marwari, and Madras Red sheep breeds. Least square analysis revealed significant effect (P < 0.05) of season and breed on all the physiological parameters, i.e., temperature, respiratory rate, and pulse rate (a.m. and p.m.), as well as hematological parameters like Hb, packed cell volume, total erythrocyte count (TEC), neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, and total leukocyte count (TLC). There was a significant influence (P < 0.05) of breed on biochemical parameters such as glucose, SGOT, phosphorous, triglyceride, and cholesterol. Eight fragments were amplified and sequenced in HSP90, and 70 genes and 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. Tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system PCR, PCR-RFLP, and allele-specific PCR genotyping protocols were developed for large-scale genotyping of five SNPs. A significant difference (P < 0.05) of rectal temperature (a.m.), respiratory rate (p.m.), triglyceride, and total protein was observed at SNP01; albumin at SNP2; pulse rate (p.m.) at SNP3; and rectal temperature (p.m.), pulse rate (p.m.), Hb (g/dL), and N/L ratio at SNP4 and TLC at SNP5. Gene expression analysis revealed lower expression in less adapted animals with Madras Red < Magra < Chokla < Marwari expression pattern. Predominant allele was found to be superior in most of the SNPs (SNP1–4) indicating the selection acting in directional manner (positive selection). Finally, it is concluded that TACCA haplotype combination of SNP1-SNP2-SNP3-SNP4-SNP5 might be of some selection advantage for the identification of animals more adaptable to heat stress.

Abstract: We have reported that Achaete scute-like 2 (Ascl2) transcriptionally repressed miR-200 family members and affected the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) plasticity in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. However, little is known about the regulation of the Ascl2/miR-200 axis. Here, we found that hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) mRNA levels were positively correlated with Ascl2 mRNA levels and inversely correlated with miR-200b in CRC samples. Mechanistically, we showed that Ascl2 was a downstream target of HIF-1α and had a critical role in the EMT phenotype induced by hypoxia or HIF-1α over-expression. Hypoxia or HIF-1α over-expression activated Ascl2 expression in CRC cells in a direct transcriptional mechanism via binding with the hypoxia-response element (HRE) at the proximal Ascl2 promoter. HIF-1α-induced Ascl2 expression repressed miR-200b expression to induce EMT occurrence. Furthermore, we found HIF-1α was a direct target of miR-200b. MiR-200b bound with the 3′-UTR of HIF-1α in CRC cells. HIF-1α/Ascl2/miR-200b regulatory feedback circuit modulated the EMT-MET plasticity of CRC cells. Our results confirmed a novel HIF-1α/Ascl2/miR-200b regulatory feedback circuit in modulating EMT-MET plasticity of CRC cells, which could serve as a possible therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-resident macrophages, such as microglia, Kupffer cells, and Langerhans cells, derive from Myb-independent yolk sac (YS) progenitors generated before the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Myb-independent YS-derived resident macrophages self-renew locally, independently of circulating monocytes and HSCs. In contrast, adult blood monocytes, as well as infiltrating, gut, and dermal macrophages, derive from Myb-dependent HSCs. These findings are derived from the mouse, using gene knockouts and lineage tracing, but their applicability to human development has not been formally demonstrated. Here, we use human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a tool to model human hematopoietic development. By using a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout strategy, we show that human iPSC-derived monocytes/macrophages develop in an MYB-independent, RUNX1-, and SPI1 (PU.1)-dependent fashion. This result makes human iPSC-derived macrophages developmentally related to and a good model for MYB-independent tissue-resident macrophages, such as alveolar and kidney macrophages, microglia, Kupffer cells, and Langerhans cells.

Abstract: Iron is a crucial component of heme- and iron-sulfur clusters, involved in vital cellular functions such as oxygen transport, DNA synthesis, and respiration. Both excess and insufficient levels of iron and heme-precursors cause human disease, such as iron-deficiency anemia, hemochromatosis, and porphyrias. Hence, their levels must be tightly regulated, requiring a complex network of transporters and feedback mechanisms. The use of zebrafish to study these pathways and the underlying genetics offers many advantages, among others their optical transparency, ex-vivo development and high genetic and physiological conservations. This chapter first reviews well-established methods, such as large-scale mutagenesis screens that have led to the initial identification of a series of iron and heme transporters and the generation of a variety of mutant lines. Other widely used techniques are based on injection of RNA, including complementary morpholino knockdown and gene overexpression. In addition, we highlight several recently developed approaches, most notably endonuclease-based gene knockouts such as TALENs or the CRISPR/Cas9 system that have been used to study how loss of function can induce human disease phenocopies in zebrafish. Rescue by chemical complementation with iron-based compounds or small molecules can subsequently be used to confirm causality of the genetic defect for the observed phenotype. All together, zebrafish have proven to be – and will continue to serve as an ideal model to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of human iron and heme-related diseases and to develop novel therapies to treat these conditions.

Abstract: Cdc42-interacting protein-4 (CIP4) has been reported to be closely associated with diabetic nephropathy in rat. However, little is known about the correlation between CIP4 and diabetic pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in mice. Here, diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ), and later lung tissue was collected and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining for morphological examination. The distinct up-regulation of CIP4 was observed in diabetic PF mice. CIP4 silencing increased overall weight and decreased lung weight. Simultaneously, levels of TGF-β1, collagen-1, collagen-3 and hydroxyproline were down-regulated by CIP4 silencing, accompanied by an increase in MMP-9 expression and a decrease in TIMP-1 expression. Down-regulation of CIP4 suppressed EMT by decreasing the expression of vimentin and α-SMA as well as augmenting E-cadherin expression. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that CIP4 silencing inhibited p-GSK-3β and β-catenin expression, indicating that CIP4 down-regulation attenuated the activation of Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling. However, β-catenin overexpression ameliorated the inhibitory effect of CIP4 down-regulation on lung tissue damage, fibrosis-related cytokines and EMT. These results suggest that CIP4 silencing can efficiently alleviate STZ-induced PF in mice, perhaps through suppressing Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling.

Abstract: In the field of hematopoietic regeneration, deriving hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from pluripotent stem cells with engraftment potential is the central mission. Unstable hematopoietic differentiation protocol due to variation factors such as serums and feeder cells, remains a major technical issue impeding the screening of key factors for the derivation of HSCs. In combination with hematopoietic cytokines, UM171 has the capacity to facilitate the maintenance and expansion of human primary HSCs in vitro. Here, using a serum-free, feeder-free, and chemically defined induction protocol, we observed that UM171 enhanced hematopoietic derivation through the entire process of hematopoietic induction in vitro. UM171 facilitated generation of robust CD34+CD45+ derivatives that formed more and larger sized CFU-GM as well as larger sized CFU-Mix. In our protocol, the derived hematopoietic progenitors failed to engraft in NOG mice, indicating the absence of long-term HSC from these progenitors. In combination with other factors and protocols, UM171 might be broadly used for hematopoietic derivation from human pluripotent stem cells in vitro.

Abstract: 12-Lipoxygenase (12-LOX) metabolizes arachidonic acid to 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, or 12(S)-HETE, a proinflammatory bioactive lipid implicated in tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The mechanisms underlying 12-LOX-mediated signaling in cancer progression are still ill-defined. In the present study we demonstrate that 12-LOX phosphorylation and subsequent enzymatic activity occurs after integrin β4 stimulation and Src kinase recruitment to the integrin subunit. Inhibition of Src activity by PP2 or Src dominant-negative mutants reduced 12-LOX tyrosine phosphorylation and 12(S)-HETE production in response to integrin β4 stimulation in A431 cells. The pertinent Src-targeted residues for 12-LOX activity were mapped to Y19 and Y614, where 12-LOX mutants Y19F and Y614F showed 70% less enzymatic activity. Furthermore, we have shown that the 12-LOX activity modulated by these residues impacts migration. To our knowledge, this is the first report that c-Src kinase activity is required for β4-integrin-mediated phosphorylation of 12-LOX.

Abstract: Molecular motors propel cellular components at velocities up to microns per second with nanometer precision. Imaging techniques combining high temporal and spatial resolution are therefore indispensable to understand the cellular mechanics at the molecular level. For example, intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains constantly shuttle ciliary components between the base and tip of the eukaryotic cilium. 3-D electron microscopy has revealed IFT train morphology and position, but was unable to correlate these features with the direction of train movement. Here, we present the methodology required to combine live-cell imaging at millisecond frame rates with electron tomography. Using this approach, we were able to correlate the direction of movement of every IFT train in a flagellum with its morphology and microtubule track. The method is ready to be further adapted for other experimental systems, including studies of single molecule dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Protein synthesis plays an essential role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Inhibitors of eukaryotic translation have entered the clinic, establishing the translation machinery as a promising target for chemotherapy. A recently discovered, structurally unique marine sponge-derived brominated alkaloid, (−)-agelastatin A (AglA), possesses potent antitumor activity. Its underlying mechanism of action, however, has remained unknown. Using a systematic top-down approach, we show that AglA selectively inhibits protein synthesis. Using a high-throughput chemical footprinting method, we mapped the AglA-binding site to the ribosomal A site. A 3.5 Å crystal structure of the 80S eukaryotic ribosome from S. cerevisiae in complex with AglA was obtained, revealing multiple conformational changes of the nucleotide bases in the ribosome accompanying the binding of AglA. Together, these results have unraveled the mechanism of inhibition of eukaryotic translation by AglA at atomic level, paving the way for future structural modifications to develop AglA analogs into novel anticancer agents.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), with their dual capacity to self-renew and differentiate, are commonly used to study differentiation, epigenetic regulation, lineage choices, and more. Using non-directed retroviral integration of a YFP/Cherry exon into mouse ESCs, we generated a library of over 200 endogenously tagged fluorescent fusion proteins and present several proof-of-concept applications of this library. We show the utility of this library to track proteins in living cells; screen for pluripotency-related factors; identify heterogeneously expressing proteins; measure the dynamics of endogenously labeled proteins; track proteins recruited to sites of DNA damage; pull down tagged fluorescent fusion proteins using anti-Cherry antibodies; and test for interaction partners. Thus, this library can be used in a variety of different directions, either exploiting the fluorescent tag for imaging-based techniques or utilizing the fluorescent fusion protein for biochemical pull-down assays, including immunoprecipitation, co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and more.

Abstract: Summary
Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) contribute to muscle regeneration following injury. In many muscle disorders, the repeated cycles of damage and repair lead to stem cell dysfunction. While telomere attrition may contribute to aberrant stem cell functions, methods to accurately measure telomere length in stem cells from skeletal muscles have not been demonstrated. Here, we have optimized and validated such a method, named MuQ-FISH, for analyzing telomere length in MuSCs from either mice or humans. Our analysis showed no differences in telomere length between young and aged MuSCs from uninjured wild-type mice, but MuSCs isolated from young dystrophic mice exhibited significantly shortened telomeres. In corroboration, we demonstrated that telomere attrition is present in human dystrophic MuSCs, which underscores its importance in diseased regenerative failure. The robust technique described herein provides analysis at a single-cell resolution and may be utilized for other cell types, especially rare populations of cells.

Abstract: Summary
Carbamylation is a non-enzymatic post-translational modification that physiologically occurs during aging and is a risk factor for various diseases. The most common product of carbamylation is homocitrulline (HCit), where a lysine (Lys) amino group has reacted with urea-derived cyanate. HCit has recently been detected in collagen; however, given that 15%–90% of total Lys in collagen is hydroxylated, it is unclear how hydroxylation affects collagen carbamylation. Here, we identified a collagen-specific carbamylation product, hydroxyhomocitrulline (HHCit), and showed that high levels of HHCit are correlated with age in rat tissue collagen and in vivo carbamylation in mice, as well as with the decline of kidney function in the serum of dialysis patients. Proteomic analysis of the carbamylated collagens identified α2(I) Lys933, a major cross-linking site, as a preferential HHCit site. Furthermore, our results suggest that hydroxylysine carbamylation affects the mechanical properties of connective tissue by competitively inhibiting collagen cross-link formation.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue, caused by four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), is a highly prevalent mosquito-borne viral disease in humans. Yet, selection pressures driving DENV microevolution within human hosts (intrahost) remain unknown. We employed a whole-genome segmented amplification approach coupled with deep sequencing to profile DENV-3 intrahost diversity in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and plasma samples from 77 dengue patients. DENV-3 intrahost diversity appears to be driven by immune pressures as well as replicative success in PBMCs and potentially other replication sites. Hotspots for intrahost variation were detected in 59%–78% of patients in the viral Envelope and pre-Membrane/Membrane proteins, which together form the virion surface. Dominant variants at the hotspots arose via convergent microevolution, appear to be immune-escape variants, and were evolutionarily constrained at the macro level due to viral replication defects. Dengue is thus an example of an acute infection in which selection pressures within infected individuals drive rapid intrahost virus microevolution.

Abstract: Summary
NLRP3 is a receptor important for host responses to infection, yet is also known to contribute to devastating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and others, making inhibitors for NLRP3 sought after. One of the inhibitors currently in use is 2-aminoethoxy diphenylborinate (2APB). Unfortunately, in addition to inhibiting NLRP3, 2APB also displays non-selective effects on cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Here, we use 2APB as a chemical scaffold to build a series of inhibitors, the NBC series, which inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro and in vivo without affecting Ca2+ homeostasis. The core chemical insight of this work is that the oxazaborine ring is a critical feature of the NBC series, and the main biological insight the use of NBC inhibitors led to was that NLRP3 inflammasome activation was independent of Ca2+. The NBC compounds represent useful tools to dissect NLRP3 function, and may lead to oxazaborine ring-containing therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Beta-cell replacement therapy is an effective means to restore glucose homeostasis in select humans with autoimmune diabetes. The scarcity of “healthy” human donor pancreata restricts the broader application of this effective curative therapy. “β-Like” cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC), with the capacity to secrete insulin in a glucose-regulated manner, have been developed in vitro, with limitless capacity for expansion. Here we report long-term diabetes correction in mice transplanted with hESC-derived pancreatic endoderm cells (PECs) in a prevascularized subcutaneous site. This advancement mitigates chronic foreign-body response, utilizes a device- and growth factor-free approach, facilitates in vivo differentiation of PECs into glucose-responsive insulin-producing cells, and reliably restores glycemic control. Basal and stimulated human C-peptide secretion was detected throughout the study, which was abolished upon graft removal. Recipient mice demonstrated physiological clearance of glucose in response to metabolic challenge and safely retrieved grafts contained viable glucose regulatory cells.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) exhibit an ATP-independent chaperone activity to prevent the aggregation of misfolded proteins in vitro. The seemingly conflicting presence of sHsps in insoluble protein aggregates in cells obstructs a precise definition of sHsp function in proteostasis networks. Recent findings specify sHsp activities in protein quality control systems. The sHsps of yeast, Hsp42 and Hsp26, interact with early unfolding intermediates of substrates, keeping them in a ready-to-refold conformation close to the native state. This activity facilitates substrate refolding by ATP-dependent Hsp70-Hsp100 disaggregating chaperones. Hsp42 can actively sequester misfolded proteins and promote their deposition at specific cellular sites. This aggregase activity represents a cytoprotective protein quality control strategy. The aggregase function of Hsp42 controls the formation of cytosolic aggregates (CytoQs) under diverse stress regimes and can be reconstituted in vitro, demonstrating that Hsp42 is necessary and sufficient to promote protein aggregation. Substrates sequestered at CytoQs can be dissociated by Hsp70-Hsp100 disaggregases for subsequent triage between refolding and degradation pathways or are targeted for destruction by selective autophagy termed proteophagy.

Abstract: Spliceosomes are the core host of pre-mRNA splicing, allowing multiple protein isoforms to be produced from a single gene. Herein, we reveal that spliceosomes are more abundant in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSs), including human embryonic stem cells (hESs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSs), than non-hPSs, and their presence is associated with high transcriptional activity. Supportively, spliceosomal components involved in the catalytically active pre-mRNA splicing step were mainly co-localized with hPS spliceosomes. By profiling the gene expression of 342 selected splicing factors, we found that 71 genes were significantly altered during the reprogramming of human somatic cells into hiPSs. Among them, SNRPA1, SNRPD1, and PNN were significantly up-regulated during the early stage of reprogramming, identified as hub genes by interaction network and cluster analysis. SNRPA1, SNRPD1, or PNN depletion led to a pronounced loss of pluripotency and significantly blocked hiPS generation. SNRPA1, SNRPD1, and PNN co-localized with the hPS spliceosomes, physically interacted with each other, and positively influenced the appearance of hPS spliceosomes. Our data suggest that SNRPA1, SNRPD1, and PNN are key players in the regulation of pluripotency-specific spliceosome assembly and the acquisition and maintenance of pluripotency.

Abstract: Summary
Notch signaling is critically involved in neural development, but the downstream effectors remain incompletely understood. In this study, we cultured neurospheres from Nestin-Cre-mediated conditional Rbp-j knockout (Rbp-j cKO) and control embryos and compared their miRNA expression profiles using microarray. Among differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-342-5p showed upregulated expression as Notch signaling was genetically or pharmaceutically interrupted. Consistently, the promoter of the miR-342-5p host gene, the Ena-vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein-like (Evl), was negatively regulated by Notch signaling, probably through HES5. Transfection of miR-342-5p promoted the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) in vitro and reduced the stemness of NSCs in vivo. Furthermore, miR-342-5p inhibited the differentiation of neural stem/intermediate progenitor cells into astrocytes, likely mediated by targeting GFAP directly. Our results indicated that miR-342-5p could function as a downstream effector of Notch signaling to regulate the differentiation of NSCs into INPs and astrocytes commitment.

Abstract: Summary
Limited migration of neural stem cells in adult brain is a roadblock for the use of stem cell therapies to treat brain diseases and injuries. Here, we report a strategy that mobilizes and guides migration of stem cells in the brain in vivo. We developed a safe stimulation paradigm to deliver directional currents in the brain. Tracking cells expressing GFP demonstrated electrical mobilization and guidance of migration of human neural stem cells, even against co-existing intrinsic cues in the rostral migration stream. Transplanted cells were observed at 3 weeks and 4 months after stimulation in areas guided by the stimulation currents, and with indications of differentiation. Electrical stimulation thus may provide a potential approach to facilitate brain stem cell therapies.

Abstract: Culture conditions used for the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSCs and HPCs, collectively HSPCs) should ideally favor the self renewal of long-term HSCs. At 20% O2, the synthesis of HIF-1α is balanced by its hydroxylation and proteasomal degradation. This favors HSPC differentiation, but can be prevented by culturing CD34+ cord blood cells in the presence of dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG). This differentiation may also be reduced by culturing the cells in the presence of Stemregenin 1, an antagonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The objective of this study was to investigate how hypoxia, DMOG and Stemregenin 1 might affect the expansion of HSPCs with the aim of identifying optimal conditions for expansion in culture. It was found that DMOG decreased proliferation but was effective in preserving the number of cells in the primitive hematopoietic sub-populations in vitro. The effect of DMOG was similar to hypoxia, although differences were observed with regard to the side population and CD34+ sub-populations. Stemregenin 1 on the other hand increased the size of the primitive as well as the other HSC sub-populations. The use of Stemregenin 1 with DMOG increased the proportion of primitive HSCs to 3.54% compared to 2.61% for Stemregenin 1 alone. In vivo engraftment studies confirmed these findings and showed that fewer cells (3710) are required for long-term engraftment when HSCs are grown in Stemregenin 1 together with hypoxia than in Stemregenin 1 under conditions of normoxia (13430).

Abstract: Summary
Estrogen stimulates breast development during puberty and mammary tumors in adulthood through estrogen receptor-α (ERα). These effects are proposed to occur via ERα+ luminal cells and not the mammary stem cells (MaSCs) that are ERαneg. Since ERα+ luminal cells express stem cell antigen-1 (SCA-1), we sought to determine if SCA-1 could define an ERα+ subset of EpCAM+/CD24+/CD49fhi MaSCs. We show that the MaSC population has a distinct SCA-1+ population that is abundant in pre-pubertal mammary glands. The SCA-1+ MaSCs have less stem cell markers and less in vivo repopulating activity than their SCA-1neg counterparts. However, they express ERα and specifically enter the cell cycle at puberty. Using estrogen-deficient aromatase knockouts (ArKO), we showed that the SCA-1+ MaSC could be directly modulated by estrogen supplementation. Thus, SCA-1 enriches for an ERα+, estrogen-sensitive subpopulation within the CD24+/CD49fhi MaSC population that may be responsible for the hormonal sensitivity of the developing mammary gland.

Abstract: Summary
Monitoring pluripotent stem cell behaviors (self-renewal and differentiation to specific lineages/phenotypes) is critical for a fundamental understanding of stem cell biology and their translational applications. In this study, a multi-modal stem cell monitoring system was developed to quantitatively characterize physico-electrochemical changes of the cells in real time, in relation to cellular activities during self-renewal or lineage-specific differentiation, in a non-destructive, label-free manner. The system was validated by measuring physical (mass) and electrochemical (impedance) changes in human induced pluripotent stem cells undergoing self-renewal, or subjected to mesendodermal or ectodermal differentiation, and correlating them to morphological (size, shape) and biochemical changes (gene/protein expression). An equivalent circuit model was used to further dissect the electrochemical (resistive and capacitive) contributions of distinctive cellular features. Overall, the combination of the physico-electrochemical measurements and electrical circuit modeling collectively offers a means to longitudinally quantify the states of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.

Abstract: In this chapter the authors report on an automated hardware and software solution enabling swift correlative sample array mapping of fluorescently stained molecules within cells and tissues across length scales. Samples are first observed utilizing wide-field optical and fluorescence microscopy, followed by scanning electron microscopy, using calibration points on a dedicated sample-relocation holder. We investigated HeLa cells in vitro, fluorescently labeled for monosialoganglioside one (GM-1), across both imaging platforms within tens of minutes of initial sample preparation. This resulted in a high-throughput and high spatially resolved correlative fluorescence and electron microscopy analysis and allowed us to collect complementary nanoscopic information on the molecular and structural composition of two differently distinct HeLa cell populations expressing different levels of GM-1. Furthermore, using the small zebrafish animal model Danio rerio, we showed the versatility and relocation accuracy of the sample-relocation holder to locate fluo-tagged macromolecular complexes within large volumes using long ribbons of serial tissue sections. The subsequent electron microscopy imaging of the tissue arrays of interest enabled the generation of correlated information on the fine distribution of albumin within hepatic and kidney tissue. Our approach underpins the merits that an automated sample-relocation holder solution brings in support of results-driven research, where relevant biological questions can be answered, and high-throughput data can be generated in a rigorous statistical manner.

Abstract: Although SRSF3 (Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3) plays a significant role in various biological processes, many of its functions still remain unclear. More particularly, little is known about SRSF3's involvement in the regulation of miRNA. In this report, we found that invasive and migratory abilities were inhibited in SRSF3-silenced U2OS and HeLa cells. We also found that a knockdown of SRSF3 results in a decreased expression level of REST (RE1-silencing transcription factor). The silencing of REST increased the expression of primary miR-132/212 as well as their mature forms. In particular, miR-132-3p and miR-212-3p possess an identical seed sequences and a common target gene. Overexpression of miR-132-3p and miR-212-3p suppressed the expression of YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) by directly binding to the 3՚UTR of its mRNA. CCND1 (Cyclin D1), which acts downstream of YAP1, was downregulated in both miR-132-3p and miR-212-3p-overexpressed cells, in correlation with diminished YAP1 levels. Taken together, our results reveal that SRSF3 controls the expression of the miR-132/212 cluster through regulating REST expression, and that the REST-elicited alteration of miRNA expression is implicated in enabling the migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells.

Abstract: Proteasome activator subunit 3 (PSME3) plays a key role in breast cancer by regulating the cell cycle. However, its role in other pathogenesis-related features of breast cancer is unclear. In this study, we found that overexpression of PSME3 induced the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and contributed to induce the expression of cancer stem cell markers of the MDA-MB-231 cell line, thus increasing the migration, and invasion of the cells. Moreover, overexpression of PSME3 reduced the chemotaxis of CD8+ T cells and induced the apoptosis of T cells in vitro. Furthermore, PSME3 knockdown increased the number of CD8+ T cells in vivo and reduced the subcutaneous tumor growth rate. These findings revealed that PSME3 induces epithelial–mesenchymal transition with inducing the expression of CSC markers and influencing the tumor immune microenvironment in breast cancer.

Abstract: Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is characterized by the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and inflammatory lesions. The aim of this study is to elucidate the effect of atractylenolide I (AO-I) on smooth muscle cell inflammation, proliferation and migration induced by oxidized modified low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL). Here, We found that atractylenolide I inhibited Ox-LDL-induced VSMCs proliferation and migration in a dose-dependent manner, and decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines and the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in VSMCs. The study also identified that AO-I prominently inhibited p38-MAPK and NF-κB activation. More importantly, the specific heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) IX partially abolished the beneficial effects of atractylenolide I on Ox-LDL-induced VSMCs. Furthermore, atractylenolide I blocked the foam cell formation in macrophages induced by Ox-LDL. In summary, inhibitory roles of AO-I in VSMCs proliferation and migration, lipid peroxidation and subsequent inflammatory responses might contribute to the anti-atherosclerotic property of AO-I.

Abstract: Summary
Human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) derived from pluripotent stem cells display a high propensity for neuronal differentiation, but they require long-term culturing to differentiate efficiently into astrocytes. The mechanisms underlying this biased fate specification of hNPCs remain elusive. Here, we show that hypoxia confers astrocytic differentiation potential on hNPCs through epigenetic gene regulation, and that this was achieved by cooperation between hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and Notch signaling, accompanied by a reduction of DNA methylation level in the promoter region of a typical astrocyte-specific gene, Glial fibrillary acidic protein. Furthermore, we found that this hypoxic culture condition could be applied to rapid generation of astrocytes from Rett syndrome patient-derived hNPCs, and that these astrocytes impaired neuronal development. Thus, our findings shed further light on the molecular mechanisms regulating hNPC differentiation and provide attractive tools for the development of therapeutic strategies for treating astrocyte-mediated neurological disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib (Cfz) and bortezomib (Btz) are used successfully to treat multiple myeloma, but have not shown clinical efficacy in solid tumors. Here we show that clinically achievable inhibition of the β5 site of the proteasome by Cfz and Btz does not result in loss of viability of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We use site-specific inhibitors and CRISPR-mediated genetic inactivation of β1 and β2 to demonstrate that inhibiting a second site of the proteasome, particularly the β2 site, sensitizes cell lines to Btz and Cfz in vitro and in vivo. Inhibiting both β5 and β2 suppresses production of the soluble, active form of the transcription factor Nrf1 and prevents the recovery of proteasome activity through induction of new proteasomes. These findings provide a strong rationale for the development of dual β5 and β2 inhibitors for the treatment of solid tumors.

Abstract: Senior individuals older than 65 years of age are at a disproportionally higher risk of developing pneumonia. Impaired capacity to defend against airway infections may be one of the reasons. It is generally believed that weaker regulatory T cell responses may be beneficial to host defense against pathogens. In senior patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, we investigated the frequencies and functions of regulatory T cells. Interestingly, we found that compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls, senior pneumonia patients presented lower frequencies of Foxp3-expressing and Helios-expressing CD4+ T cells. The quantity of Foxp3 and Helios being expressed, measured by their mRNA transcription levels, was also lower in CD4+ T cells from pneumonia patients. Furthermore, following TCR and TGF-β stimulation, pneumonia patients presented impaired capacity to upregulate Foxp3 and Helios. Functional analyses revealed that CD4+ T cells from pneumonia patients secreted lower amounts of IL-10 and TGF-β, two cytokines critical to regulatory T cell-mediated suppression. Also, the expression of granzyme B and perforin, which were cytolytic molecules potentially utilized by regulatory T cells to mediate the elimination of antigen-presenting cells and effector T cells, were reduced in CD4+CD25+ T cells from senior pneumonia patients. In addition, the CD4+CD25+ T cells from senior pneumonia patients presented reduced capacity to suppress effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation. Moreover, the value of pneumonia severity index was inversely correlated with several parameters of regulatory T cell function. Together, our results demonstrated that senior pneumonia patients presented a counterintuitive impairment in regulatory T cell responses that was associated with worse prognosis.

Abstract: Summary
Stimulating autophagy is a promising therapeutic strategy for slowing the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Neurons are insensitive to current approaches based on mTOR inhibition for activating autophagy, and instead may rely on the Parkinson's disease-associated proteins PINK1 and PARKIN to activate the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in response to mitochondrial damage. We developed a multifactorial zebrafish drug-screening platform combining Pink1 deficiency with an environmental toxin to compromise mitochondrial function and trigger dopaminergic neuron loss. Using a phenotypic screening strategy, we identified a series of piperazine phenothiazines, including trifluoperazine, which rescued Pink1 deficiency by activating autophagy selectively in stressed zebrafish and human cells. We show that trifluoperazine acts downstream of, or parallel to, PINK1/PARKIN to stimulate transcription factor EB nuclear translocation and the expression of autophagy-lysosomal target genes. These data suggest that stress-dependent pharmacological reactivation of autophagy could prevent the loss of vulnerable neurons to slow neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are promising in regenerative medicine. Although several hESC-based clinical trials are under way, a widely accepted standard of clinical-grade cells remains obscure. To attain a completely xeno-free clinical-grade cell line, the system must be free of xenogenic components, the cells must have a comprehensive set of functions, and good manufacturing practice conditions must be used. In this study, following these criteria, we successfully derived two hESC lines, which were thereby considered “clinical-grade embryonic stem cells”. In addition to the primary capacity for pluripotency, these two cell lines were efficiently differentiated into various types of clinical-grade progeny. Importantly, the cells were recognized by the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control of China for further eligible accreditation. These data indicate that we have established completely xeno-free clinical-grade hESC lines and their derivatives, which will be valuable for the foundation of an international standard for clinical-grade cells for therapy.

Abstract: Recent clinical and experimental evidences strongly acclaim Yes-associated protein (Yap), a key oncogenic driver in liver carcinogenesis, as a therapeutic target. Of the known multiple schemes to inhibit Yap activity, activation of Mammalian Sterile 20-like Kinase 1 (Mst1), an upstream regulator of Yap, appears to be a promising one. In this study, we hypothesize that morin, a bioflavonoid, mediates its anti-cancer effect through the activation of Mst1/hippo signaling in liver cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, both full length Mst1 (F-Mst1) and kinase active N-terminal Mst1 (N-Mst1)-overexpressed HepG2 cells were used. Exposure of F-Mst1 overexpressed HepG2 cells to morin activated Mst1 by caspase-3 cleavage and thereby inhibited Yap nuclear translocation and fostered apoptosis. Morin suppressed NF-κB p65 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling through Mst1 activation via cleavage and phosphorylation, leading to cell death. Annexin-V/PI staining further confirmed the induction of apoptosis in morin treated F-Mst1 overexpressed cells. The present study shows that morin targets cell survival molecules such as NF-κB p65 and β-catenin through activation of hippo signaling. Therefore, morin could be considered as a potential anti-cancer agent against liver cancer.

Abstract: While numerous maladies are associated with hypobaric hypoxia, muscle protein loss is an important under studied topic. Hence, the present study was designed to investigate the mechanism of muscle protein loss at HH. SD rats were divided into normoxic rats, while remaining rats were exposed to simulated hypoxia equivalent to 282-torr pressure (equal to an altitude of 7620 m, 8% oxygen), at 25°C for 6, 12, and 24 h. Post-exposure rats were sacrificed and analysis was performed. Ergo, muscle loss-related changes were observed at 12 and 24 h post-HH exposure. An increased reactive oxygen species production and decreased thiol content was observed in HH-exposed rats. This disturbance caused substantial protein oxidative modification in the form of protein carbonyl content and advanced oxidation protein products. The analysis showed increase levels of bityrosine, oxidized tryptophan, lysine conjugate, lysine conjugate with MDA, protein hydroperoxide, and protein-MDA product. These changes were also in agreement with increase in lipid hydroperoxides and MDA content. HSP-70 and HSP-60 were upregulated significantly, and this finding is corroborated with increase in ER stress biomarker, GRP-78. Overloading of cells with misfolded proteins further activated degradative machinery. Consequently, pro-apoptotic signaling cascade, caspase-3, and C/EBP homologous protein were also activated in 24-h HH exposure. Release of tryptophan and tyrosine was also increased with 24-h HH exposure, indicated protein degradation. Elevation in resting intracellular calcium ion, [Ca2+]i, was also observed at 12- and 24-h HH exposure. The present study provides a detailed mechanistic representation of muscle protein loss during HH exposure.

Abstract: Summary
We recently developed a technique for generating hypothalamic neurons from human pluripotent stem cells. Here, as proof of principle, we examine the use of these cells in modeling of a monogenic form of severe obesity: PCSK1 deficiency. The cognate enzyme, PC1/3, processes many prohormones in neuroendocrine and other tissues. We generated PCSK1 (PC1/3)-deficient human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines using both short hairpin RNA and CRISPR-Cas9, and investigated pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) processing using hESC-differentiated hypothalamic neurons. The increased levels of unprocessed POMC and the decreased ratios (relative to POMC) of processed POMC-derived peptides in both PCSK1 knockdown and knockout hESC-derived neurons phenocopied POMC processing reported in PC1/3-null mice and PC1/3-deficient patients. PC1/3 deficiency was associated with increased expression of melanocortin receptors and PRCP (prolylcarboxypeptidase, a catabolic enzyme for α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH)), and reduced adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. We conclude that the obesity accompanying PCSK1 deficiency may not be primarily due to αMSH deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) is a central metabolite in mammalian fatty acid biochemistry generated and utilized in the cytoplasm; however, little is known about noncanonical organelle-specific malonyl-CoA metabolism. Intramitochondrial malonyl-CoA is generated by a malonyl-CoA synthetase, ACSF3, which produces malonyl-CoA from malonate, an endogenous competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase. To determine the metabolic requirement for mitochondrial malonyl-CoA, ACSF3 knockout (KO) cells were generated by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing. ACSF3 KO cells exhibited elevated malonate and impaired mitochondrial metabolism. Unbiased and targeted metabolomics analysis of KO and control cells in the presence or absence of exogenous malonate revealed metabolic changes dependent on either malonate or malonyl-CoA. While ACSF3 was required for the metabolism and therefore detoxification of malonate, ACSF3-derived malonyl-CoA was specifically required for lysine malonylation of mitochondrial proteins. Together, these data describe an essential role for ACSF3 in dictating the metabolic fate of mitochondrial malonate and malonyl-CoA in mammalian metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The striking rise of obesity-related metabolic disorders has focused attention on adipocytes as critical mediators of disease phenotypes. To better understand the role played by excess adipose in metabolic dysfunction it is crucial to decipher the transcriptional underpinnings of the low-grade adipose inflammation characteristic of diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Through employing a comparative transcriptomics approach, we identified IRF1 as differentially regulated between primary and in vitro-derived genetically matched adipocytes. This suggests a role as a mediator of adipocyte inflammatory phenotypes, similar to its function in other tissues. Utilizing adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitors we subsequently demonstrated that expression of IRF1 in adipocytes indeed contributes to upregulation of inflammatory processes, both in vitro and in vivo. This highlights IRF1's relevance to obesity-related inflammation and the resultant metabolic dysregulation.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy and the molecular pathogenesis of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma has not been completely characterized. Numerous studies have shown that altered splicing patterns and splicing factors were found to contribute to tumor development and progression. In this study, we demonstrated that spliceosome-associated factor CTNNBL1 was significantly upregulated in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, the elevated level of CTNNBL1 indicates poor prognosis in patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Functional characterization revealed that CTNNBL1 promoted the proliferation and invasion of ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, through transcriptome analysis, we found CTNNBL1 regulates multiple splicing events and gene expression in ovarian cancer cells. Importantly, we identified IFI16 and FOXM1 splicing was regulated by CTNNBL1. To our knowledge, this is the first study exploring the expression, functional roles and regulated splicing events of CTNNBL1 in ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Metastasis formation is strongly dependent on the migration capabilities of tumor cells. Recently it has become apparent that nuclear structure and morphology affect the cellular ability to migrate. Previously we found that migration of melanoma cells is both associated with and dependent on global chromatin condensation. Therefore, we anticipated that tumor progression would be associated with increased chromatin condensation. Interestingly, the opposite has been reported for melanoma. In trying to resolve this contradiction, we show that during growth conditions, tumor progression is associated with global chromatin de-condensation that is beneficial for faster proliferation. However, upon induction of migration, in both low- and high-metastatic mouse melanoma cells chromatin undergoes condensation to support cell migration. Our results reveal that throughout tumor progression induction of chromatin condensation by migration signals is maintained, whereas the organization of chromatin during growth conditions is altered. Thus, tumor progression is associated with an increase in chromatin dynamics.

Abstract: Messenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) is a significant physiological phenomenon involved in embryogenesis and cancer. This study aims at investigating the mechanism of microRNA-20a (miR-20a) mediated regulation of mesenchymal to epithelial transition and identification of its direct target genes in breast cancer cell-line, MDA-MB-231. Reduced migratory and invasive property, altered cellular morphology along with reduced capability for attachment to basement membrane was acquired by over-expression of miR-20a in invasive MDA-MB-231 cell-line initially expressing low level of this micro-RNA, indicating direct correlation between abundance of miR-20a and metastatic property. The switch from mesenchymal to epithelial cells mediated by miR-20a involved post-transcriptional down-regulation of twist1, which in turn controls downstream epithelial markers like E-cadherin, claudin and mesenchymal markers like N-cadherin, fibronectin, the crucial players of mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). Furthermore, another key component, TGF-β and one of its receptors (TGFBR2) were found to be down-regulated by miR-20a. Additionally, reporter assay established that post-transcriptional down-regulation of TGFBR2 occurred through direct binding of miR-20a to its 3′UTR, thus abrogating the TGF-β signaling pathway resulting in inhibition of MET. Delineating the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-20a-mediated MET and defining the target genes will help us to introduce a miRNA-mediated effective therapeutic strategy against breast cancer.

Abstract: The ability to sense and adapt to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) is central for most organisms and cell types. At the center of this process is a molecular mechanism, the cellular hypoxic response, in which the hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are stabilized by hypoxia, allowing the HIF proteins to act as master transcriptional regulators to adjust the cell to a low oxygen environment. In recent years, it has become increasingly appreciated that the cellular hypoxic response does not always operate in splendid isolation, but intersects with signaling mechanisms such as Notch signaling, a key regulatory signaling mechanism operating in most cell types controlling stem cell maintenance and differentiation. In this review, which is dedicated to the memory of Lorenz Poellinger,11This review article is dedicated to the memory of the late Lorenz Poellinger, who was one of the leaders in hypoxia signaling (see Refs. [2], [3], [11], [13]) and was instrumental for the early phases of unraveling the Notch-hypoxia cross-talk (see Refs. [15], [16], [20], [22], [32], [63], [85]). He will be missed as a friend and scientist. we discuss how the intersection between Notch and the cellular hypoxic response was discovered and our current understanding of the molecular basis for the cross-talk. We also provide examples of where Notch and hypoxia intersect in various physiological and disease contexts.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage within the joint, inflammation and pain. The purpose of this study was to develop a primary, serum free cell culture system of human osteoarthritic articular chondrocytes (HOACs) with which to study manifestations of the disease process. Joint tissues were obtained from OA patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). HOACs isolated from the femoral condyles and tibial plateau of the same side were combined, plated in three-dimensional, alginate beads and cultured for five days in serum, hormone and protein free medium. More living cells were obtained from the femoral condyles than the tibial plateau. The optimal plating density was 2.5 × 106 cells/ml of alginate. The amounts of DNA, RNA, proteoglycans and total collagen were similar in cultures prepared from the sides of least and greatest pathology. More type 1 than type 2 collagen was detected in the medium on days 2 and 5. A greater percentage of type 1 than type 2 collagen was degraded. The inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta was present in the medium and alginate associated matrix. Although variation in the metabolic profiles between subjects was observed, HOACs from all patients continued to reflect the OA phenotype for five days in culture. This serum free, three-dimensional primary culture system of HOACs provides a platform with which to measure clinically relevant endpoints of OA and screen potential disease modifying OA therapeutics.

Abstract: Hepatitis C (HCV) is a viral disease affecting millions of people worldwide, and persistent HCV infection can lead to progressive liver disease with the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. During treatment for hepatitis C, the occurrence of viral resistance is common. To reduce the occurrence of resistance, new viral treatments should target both viral and cellular factors. Many interactions occur between viral and host proteins during the HCV replication cycle and might be used for the development of new therapies against hepatitis C. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) plays a role in the folding of cellular and viral proteins and also interacts with HCV proteins. In the present study, we knocked down the expression of the Hsp90 gene and inhibited viral replication using siRNA molecules. Reducing the expression of Hsp90 successfully decreased HCV replication. All siRNA molecules specific to the viral genome showed the efficient inhibition of viral replication, particularly siRNA targeted to the 5′UTR region. The combination of siRNAs targeting the viral genome and Hsp90 mRNA also successfully reduced HCV replication and reduced the occurrence of viral resistance. Moreover, these results suggest that an approach based on the combination of cellular and viral siRNAs can be used as an effective alternative for hepatitis C viral suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic pulmonary colonization with bacterial pathogens, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We observed that β1-integrins accumulate on the luminal membrane of upper-airway epithelial cells from mice and humans with CF. β1-integrin accumulation is due to increased ceramide and the formation of ceramide platforms that trap β1-integrins on the luminal pole of bronchial epithelial cells. β1-integrins downregulate acid ceramidase expression, resulting in further accumulation of ceramide and consequent reduction of surface sphingosine, a lipid that kills bacteria. Interrupting this vicious cycle by triggering surface β1-integrin internalization via anti-β1-integrin antibodies or the RGD peptide ligand—or by genetic or pharmacological correction of ceramide levels—normalizes β1-integrin distribution and sphingosine levels in CF epithelial cells and prevents P. aeruginosa infection in CF mice. These findings suggest a therapeutic avenue to ameliorate CF-associated bacterial infections.

Abstract: Summary
Cutaneous reactions represent one of the most common adverse drug effects observed in clinical trials leading to substantial compound attrition. Three negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which represent an important target for neurological diseases, developed by Pfizer, were recently failed in preclinical development due to delayed type IV skin hypersensitivity observed in non-human primates (NHPs). Here we employed large-scale phenotypic profiling in standardized panels of human primary cell/co-culture systems to characterize the skin toxicity mechanism(s) of mGluR5 NAMs from two different series. Investigation of a database of chemicals tested in these systems and transcriptional profiling suggested that the mechanism of toxicity may involve modulation of nuclear receptor targets RAR/RXR, and/or VDR with AhR antagonism. The studies reported here demonstrate how phenotypic profiling of preclinical drug candidates using human primary cells can provide insights into the mechanisms of toxicity and inform early drug discovery and development campaigns.

Abstract: Cisplatin often causes acute kidney injury (AKI) in the treatment of a wide variety of malignancies. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the main reasons for cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Previous study showed that Pink1 and Parkin play central roles in regulating the mitophagy, which is a key protective mechanism by specifically eliminating dysfunctional or damaged mitochondria. However, the mechanisms that modulate mitophagy in cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity remain to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Pink1/Parkin pathway in mitophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and renal proximal tubular cells injury during cisplatin treatment. In cultured human renal proximal tubular cells, we found that knockdown of Pink1/Parkin induced the aggravation of mitochondrial function, leading to the increase of cell injury through inhibition of mitophagy. Additionally, the overexpression of Pink1/Parkin protected against cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell injury by promoting mitophagy. Our results provide clear evidence that Pink1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy has identified potential targets for the treatment of cisplatin-induced AKI.

Abstract: Summary
Clinical trials of stem cell therapy to treat ischemic heart disease primarily use heterogeneous stem cell populations. Small benefits occur via paracrine mechanisms that include stimulating angiogenesis, and increased understanding of these mechanisms would help to improve patient outcomes. Cardiosphere-derived-cells (CDCs) are an example of these heterogeneous stem cell populations, cultured from cardiac tissue. CDCs express endoglin, a co-receptor that binds specific transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) family ligands, including bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9). In endothelial cells endoglin regulates angiogenic responses, and we therefore hypothesized that endoglin is required to promote the paracrine pro-angiogenic properties of CDCs. Cre/LoxP technology was used to genetically manipulate endoglin expression in CDCs, and we found that the pro-angiogenic properties of the CDC secretome are endoglin dependent both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, BMP9 pre-treatment of endoglin-depleted CDCs restores their pro-angiogenic paracrine properties. As BMP9 signaling is normally required to maintain endoglin expression, we propose that media containing BMP9 could be critical for therapeutic CDC preparation.

Abstract: The downregulation of microRNA-122 (miR-122) had been reported to be associated with tumor invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanisms of miR-122 involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) still need to be investigated. In the study, we demonstrated that miR-122 was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. MiR-122 expression was closely correlated with tumor size, vascular invasion and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage of HCC patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log rank test demonstrated that lower miR-122 predicted poor Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) time in patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis confirmed that tumor size, vascular invasion, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage and lower miR-122 expression levels were independent risk factors for DFS or OS in HCC patients. Function assays demonstrated that upregulation of miR-122 inhibited the cell proliferation, colony formation and cell invasion in HCC cells, however, downregulation of miR-122 promoted cell proliferation, colony formation and cell invasion in HCC cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that increased miR-122 expression levels in HCC cells inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing the expression of ZEB1/2, Snail1/2, N-cadherin, Vimentin and upregulating the E-cadherin expression. However, downregulation of miR-122 caused an opposite effects. Mechanisms study found that miR-122 overexpression inhibited the EMT process by targeting Snail1 and Snail2 and regulated their expression levels in HCC cells. In addition, we also revealed that upregulated miR-122 expression suppressed the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Taken together, our results indicated that miR-122 may be a biomarker for predicting prognosis of HCC and therapeutic target for HCC patients.

Abstract: Tumor hypoxia correlates to aggressive disease, and while this is explained by a variety of factors, one clue to understand this phenomena was the finding that hypoxia induces a de-differentiated, stem cell-like phenotype in neuroblastoma and breast tumor cells. The hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs) are regulated at the translational level by fluctuating oxygen concentrations, but emerging data reveal that both HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression can be induced by aberrantly activated growth factor signaling independently of oxygen levels. Furthermore, HIF-2α is regulated by hypoxia also at the transcriptional level in neuroblastoma and glioma cells. In cultured tumor cells, HIF-2α is stabilized at physiological oxygen concentrations followed by induced expression of classical hypoxia-driven genes, resulting in a pseudohypoxic phenotype. In addition, in neuroblastoma and glioma specimens, a small subset of HIF-2α positive, HIF-1α negative, tumor cells is found adjacent to blood vessels, i.e. in areas with presumably adequate oxygenation. These tumor niches are thus pseudohypoxic, and the HIF-2α expressing cells present immature features. We have postulated that this niche in neuroblastomas encompass the tumor stem cells. Oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes associated with pseudohypoxia are frequently mutated or deleted in the germline, implicating that the pseudohypoxic phenotype indeed is tumorigenic. In summary, the hypoxic and pseudohypoxic phenotypes of solid tumors are attractive therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Estrogens have been classified as group 1 carcinogens by the World Health Organization and represent a significant concern given that they are found in surface waters worldwide, and long-term exposure to estrogen-contaminated water can disrupt sexual development in animals. To date, the estrogen catabolic enzymes and genes remain unknown. Using a tiered functional genomics approach, we identified three estrogen catabolic gene clusters in Sphingomonas sp. strain KC8. We identified several estrone-derived compounds, including 4-hydroxyestrone, a meta-cleavage product, and pyridinestrone acid. The yeast-based estrogen assay suggested that pyridinestrone acid exhibits negligible estrogenic activity. We characterized 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase and 4-hydroxyestrone 4,5-dioxygenase, responsible for the 17-dehydrogenation and meta-cleavage of the estrogen A ring, respectively. The characteristic pyridinestrone acid was detected in estrone-spiked samples collected from two wastewater treatment plants and two suburban rivers in Taiwan. The results significantly expand our understanding of microbial degradation of aromatic steroids at molecular level.

Cathepsin L silencing increases As2O3 toxicity in malignantly transformed pilocytic astrocytoma MPA58 cells by activating caspases 3/7,

Abstract: Low-grade, pilocytic astrocytomas are treated by resection, but additional therapy is necessary for those tumors with anaplastic features. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is emerging as an effective chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of malignant glioblastoma multiforme, where Cathepsin L silencing enables lower, less harmful As2O3 concentrations to achieve the desired cytotoxic effect. Here, we evaluated the effects of As2O3 combined with stable Cathepsin L shRNA silencing on cell viability/metabolic activity, and apoptosis in primary cultures of recurrent malignantly transformed pilocytic astrocytoma (MPA). These cells expressed high Cathepsin L levels, and when grown as monolayers and spheroids, they were more resistant to As2O3 than the U87MG glioblastoma cell line. Caspases 3/7 activity in MPA58 spheroids was not significantly affected by As2O3, possibly due to higher chemoresistance of primary biopsy tissue of less malignant astrocytoma versus the malignant U87MG cell line. However, As2O3 treatment was cytotoxic to MPA spheroids after silencing of Cathepsin L expression. While Cathepsin L silencing only slightly decreased the live/dead cell ratio in As2O3-treated MPA-si spheroids under our experimental conditions, there was an increase in As2O3-mediated apoptosis in MPA-si spheroids, as indicated by elevated caspases 3/7 activity. Therefore, Cathepsin L silencing by gene manipulation can be applied when a more aggressive approach is needed in treatment of pilocytic astrocytomas with anaplastic features.

Abstract: Summary
Asymptomatic infections often proceed undetected, yet can still prime the host to be sensitive to secondary environmental stress. While the mechanisms underlying disease caused by asymptomatic infections are unknown, it is believed that productive pathogen replication is required. We report that the environmental stress of carbon dioxide (CO2) anesthesia converts an asymptomatic rhabdovirus infection in Drosophila to one that is lethal. This lethality results from a pool of infectious virus in glial cells and is regulated by the antiviral RNAi pathway of the host. CO2 sensitivity is caused by the fusogenic activity of the viral glycoprotein, which results in fusion of neurons and glia. Expression of the viral glycoprotein, but not a fusion defective mutant, is sufficient to cause CO2 sensitivity, which can occur even in the absence of productive viral replication. These findings highlight how viral proteins, independent of pathogen replication, may predispose hosts to life-threatening environmental stress.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the processes that govern liver progenitor cell differentiation has important implications for the design of strategies targeting chronic liver diseases, whereby regeneration of liver tissue is critical. Although DNA methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) are highly dynamic during early embryonic development, less is known about their roles at later stages of differentiation. Using an in vitro model of hepatocyte differentiation, we show here that 5hmC precedes the expression of promoter 1 (P1)-dependent isoforms of HNF4A, a master transcription factor of hepatocyte identity. 5hmC and HNF4A expression from P1 are dependent on ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases. In turn, the liver pioneer factor FOXA2 is necessary for TET1 binding to the P1 locus. Both FOXA2 and TETs are required for the 5hmC-related switch in HNF4A expression. The epigenetic event identified here may be a key step for the establishment of the hepatocyte program by HNF4A.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleosome, the fundamental structural unit of chromatin, is a critical regulator of gene expression. The mechanisms governing changes to nucleosome occupancy and positioning during somatic cell reprogramming remain poorly understood. We established a method for generating genome-wide nucleosome maps of porcine embryonic fibroblasts (PEF), reconstructed 1-cell embryos generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), and fertilized zygotes (FZ) using MNase sequencing with only 1,000 cells. We found that donor PEF chromatin, especially X chromosome, became more open after transfer into porcine oocytes and nucleosome occupancy decreased in promoters but increased in the genic regions. Nucleosome arrangements around transcriptional start sites of genes with different expression levels in somatic cells tended to become transcriptionally silent in SCNT; however, some pluripotency genes adopted transcriptionally active nucleosome arrangements. FZ and SCNT had similar characteristics, unlike PEF. This study reveals the dynamics and importance of nucleosome positioning and chromatin organization early after reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Early human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neural populations consist of various embryonic neural progenitors (ENPs) with broad neural developmental propensity. Here, we sought to directly convert human somatic cells into ENP-like phenotypes using hESC-ENP-enriched neural transcription factors (TFs). We demonstrated that induced ENP could be efficiently converted from human fibroblasts using two TF combinations. The iENPs exhibit cellular and molecular characteristics resembling hESC-ENPs and can give rise to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and functional neuronal subtypes of the central and peripheral nervous system. Nevertheless, our analyses further revealed that these two iENP populations differ in terms of their proliferation ability and neuronal propensity. Finally, we demonstrated that the iENPs can be induced from fibroblasts from patients with Huntington's disease and Alzheimer’s disease, and the diseased iENPs and their neuronal derivatives recapitulated the hallmark pathological features of the diseases. Collectively, our results point toward a promising strategy for generating iENPs from somatic cells for disease modeling and future clinical intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in oocyte quality can have great impact on the developmental potential of early embryos. Here we test whether nuclear genome transfer from a developmentally incompetent to a developmentally competent oocyte can restore developmental potential. Using in vitro oocyte aging as a model system we performed nuclear transfer in mouse oocytes at metaphase II or at the first interphase, and observed that development to the blastocyst stage and to term was as efficient as in control embryos. The increased developmental potential is explained primarily by correction of abnormal cytokinesis at anaphase of meiosis and mitosis, by a reduction in chromosome segregation errors, and by normalization of the localization of chromosome passenger complex components survivin and cyclin B1. These observations demonstrate that developmental decline is primarily due to abnormal function of cytoplasmic factors involved in cytokinesis, while the genome remains developmentally fully competent.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal and rapidly progressing motor neuron disease. Astrocytic factors are known to contribute to motor neuron degeneration and death in ALS. However, the role of astrocyte in promoting motor neuron protein aggregation, a disease hallmark of ALS, remains largely unclear. Here, using culture models of human motor neurons and primary astrocytes of different genotypes (wild-type or SOD1 mutant) and reactive states (non-reactive or reactive), we show that reactive astrocytes, regardless of their genotypes, reduce motor neuron health and lead to moderate neuronal loss. After prolonged co-cultures of up to 2 months, motor neurons show increased axonal and cytoplasmic protein inclusions characteristic of ALS. Reactive astrocytes induce protein aggregation in part by releasing transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), which disrupts motor neuron autophagy through the mTOR pathway. These results reveal the important contribution of reactive astrocytes in promoting aspects of ALS pathology independent of genetic influences.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) are formed during ontogeny from hemogenic endothelium in the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta (VDA). Critically, the cellular mechanism(s) allowing HSPC egress and migration to secondary niches are incompletely understood. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are inflammation-responsive proteins that regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, cellular interactions, and signaling. Here, inhibition of vascular-associated Mmp2 function caused accumulation of fibronectin-rich ECM, retention of runx1/cmyb+ HSPCs in the VDA, and delayed caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) colonization; these defects were absent in fibronectin mutants, indicating that Mmp2 facilitates endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition via ECM remodeling. In contrast, Mmp9 was dispensable for HSPC budding, being instead required for proper colonization of secondary niches. Significantly, these migration defects were mimicked by overexpression and blocked by knockdown of C-X-C motif chemokine-12 (cxcl12), suggesting that Mmp9 controls CHT homeostasis through chemokine regulation. Our findings indicate Mmp2 and Mmp9 play distinct but complementary roles in developmental HSPC production and migration.

Abstract: Hypercholesterolaemia is well known to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, subsequently leading to multiple organ failure. Similar to other natural products, sericin is a candidate for adjunctive therapy in hyperlipidaemic conditions. However, the cholesterol-lowering mechanisms of sericin are multifactorial and controversial. Here, a high-cholesterol-fed rat model with or without sericin treatment was established using a dosage of 1000mg/kg/day for 30 days. Blood lipid profiles, oxidative stress markers (superoxide dismutase, SOD; malondialdehyde, MDA; nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor, Nrf-2), dysmorphic mitochondria in relation to fission (dynamin-related protein-1; Drp-1) and fusion (guanosine triphosphatase mutated in dominant optic atrophy; OPA-1) markers and biosynthetic markers (aquaporin, AQP-1; tubulin-4β, Tb4B) in the pancreas and adrenal gland were evaluated. The results showed that sericin reduced blood cholesterol and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) by acting against oxidative stress. Hypocholesterolaemic and antioxidant conditions further preserved heart and liver mitochondrial architecture; however, this protection was not exhibited in the kidney, where a high level of renal mitophagy, indicating by LC-3 up-regulation, was presented. The steps of ultrastructural alteration of mitochondria from degenerative changes to necrosis were also demonstrated. Sericin also conserved AQP-1 and Tb4B levels in the exocrine pancreatic acinar cells and zona glomerulosa cells, which were positively correlated with serum lipase, HDL, antioxidative markers and mitochondrial integrity. The present study revealed that sericin not only has antioxidant capacity but also balances pancreatic and adrenal cell biosynthesis, especially lipase activity, which may have played an important role in improving lipid dysregulation in the hypercholesterolaemic rat model, leading to the reduction of dysmorphic mitochondria, particularly in the heart and liver.

Abstract: Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) is highly expressed by human epidermal keratinocytes located at the tip of the dermal papilla where keratinocytes show characteristics of stem cells. However, since available antibodies to CSPG4 are directed against trypsin-sensitive epitopes we have been unable to study these keratinocytes isolated directly from skin samples by flow cytometry. By choosing epitopes of CSPG4 relatively close to the cell membrane we were able to generate a polyclonal antibody that successfully detects CSPG4 on keratinocytes after trypsinization. Although CSPG4-positive basal cells express higher levels of Itgβ1 the colony-forming efficiency is slightly lower than CSPG4-negative basal cells. Sorting the directly isolated keratinocytes based on Itgβ1 did not reveal differences in colony-forming efficiency between keratinocytes expressing high or low levels of Itgβ1. However, after the first passage Itgβ1 could be used to predict colony-forming efficiency whether the culture was established from CSPG4-positive or CSPG4-negative basal cell keratinocytes. Although we were unable to detect differences in the colony-forming assay, global gene expression profiling showed that CSPG4-positive basal cell keratinocytes are distinct from CSPG4-negative basal cell keratinocytes. Our study demonstrates that it is possible to generate antibodies against trypsin-resistant epitopes of CSPG4. Our study also documents a marked change in behaviour upon cell culturing and challenges the way we assess for stemness within the human epidermal basal layer.

Abstract: Amyloid β (Aβ) is a critical stimulator that promotes the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by Aβ is estimated to be responsible for retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction in such disease. Puerarin, one of the major active constituents of Kudzu root, has been widely used in the clinical treatment of AMD in China for decades; however, the detailed molecular mechanism remains far from clear. In this study, we investigated the protective effect and underlying mechanism of puerarin against Aβ1–40-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-primed ARPE-19 cells. The results showed that Aβ1–40 induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation mainly via triggering ROS-dependent oxidative stress, particularly lipid peroxidation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in LPS-primed ARPE-19 cells; however, such effect could be significantly reversed by puerarin in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the effect of puerarin was potentially mediated through activating Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway and inhibiting Aβ1–40-induced phosphorylation of IRE1 and PERK as well as nuclear expression of ATF6α. Therefore, the significance of the current study is to reveal the novel mechanism of puerarin in the prevention of AMD.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common brain malignancies worldwide and is typically associated with a dismal prognosis, yet the mechanisms underlying its aggressiveness remain unclear. Here, we revealed that β-arrestin 1 was overexpressed in GBM and contributed to poorer outcome. Knockdown of β-arrestin 1 suppressed the proliferation, invasiveness and glycolysis of GBM cells, and also enhanced temozolomide efficacy. Further, we discovered that knockdown of β-arrestin 1 decreased the activity of Src, and suppression of Src signaling was critically involved in β-arrestin 1 silencing-mediated suppression of GBM malignancies. Finally, we investigated the effect of β-arrestin 1 knockdown on the tumor growth and survival of xenograft models, and found that shβ-arrestin 1 apparently inhibited GBM growth in vivo and resulted in better survival of mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that knockdown of β-arrestin 1 can suppress GBM cell proliferation, invasion and glycolysis by inhibiting Src signaling. Thus, targeting β-arrestin 1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for GBM treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Large-scale collections of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could serve as powerful model systems for examining how genetic variation affects biology and disease. Here we describe the iPSCORE resource: a collection of systematically derived and characterized iPSC lines from 222 ethnically diverse individuals that allows for both familial and association-based genetic studies. iPSCORE lines are pluripotent with high genomic integrity (no or low numbers of somatic copy-number variants) as determined using high-throughput RNA-sequencing and genotyping arrays, respectively. Using iPSCs from a family of individuals, we show that iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes demonstrate gene expression patterns that cluster by genetic background, and can be used to examine variants associated with physiological and disease phenotypes. The iPSCORE collection contains representative individuals for risk and non-risk alleles for 95% of SNPs associated with human phenotypes through genome-wide association studies. Our study demonstrates the utility of iPSCORE for examining how genetic variants influence molecular and physiological traits in iPSCs and derived cell lines.
