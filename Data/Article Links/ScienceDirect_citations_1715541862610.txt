Abstract: Reg (regenerating gene) product, Reg protein, is induced in pancreatic β-cells and acts as autocrine/paracrine growth factor for regeneration via the cell surface Reg receptor. However, high concentrations of Reg I protein induced β-cell apoptosis. In the present study, we found that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) attenuated the β-cell apoptosis induced by the high concentrations of Reg I protein and that the combined stimulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and dexamethasone (Dx) induced the accumulation of HGF mRNA as well as Reg I mRNA in β-cells. The accumulation of the HGF mRNA was caused by the activation of the HGF promoter. Deletion analysis revealed that the region of −96 to −92 of the HGF gene was responsible for the promoter activation by IL-6+Dx. The promoters contain a consensus transcription factor binding sequence for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). Site-directed mutations of STAT-binding motif in the region markedly attenuated the HGF promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that STAT3 is located at the active HGF promoter in response to IL-6+Dx stimulation. These results strongly suggest that the combined stimulation of IL-6 and glucocorticoids induces the activation of both Reg and HGF genes and that the anti-apoptotic effects of HGF against the Reg I-induced apoptosis may help β-cell regeneration by Reg I protein.

Abstract: ERK1 and ERK2 are highly homologous isoforms that often play redundant roles in regulating cellular functions. We analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of ERK1 and ERK2 in resting and activated mast cells. Strikingly, we identified distinct pathways for these kinases. ERK1 localized to the cytosol and translocated to the nucleus upon cell activation and kinase phosphorylation. In contrast, ERK2 distributed between the cytosol and near the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in resting cells and accumulated further at a pericentrosomal region upon cell trigger. Pericentrosomal accumulation of ERK2 was phosphorylation independent, required an intact microtubule network and was significantly enhanced by the overexpression of Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS-1). We also identified γ-tubulin and phosphatidylinositol 4 kinaseβ (PI4Kβ), a downstream effector of NCS-1, as novel partner proteins of ERK2. Taken together, our results imply non-redundant functions of ERK1 and ERK2 in mast cells and implicate NCS-1 and PΙ4Κβ as regulators of ERK2 trafficking.

Abstract: Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix proteins occurs through interactions with integrins that bind to Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptides, and syndecan-4, which recognizes the heparin-binding domain of other proteins. Both receptors trigger signaling pathways, including those that activate RhoGTPases such as RhoA and Rac1. This sequence of events modulates cell adhesion to the ECM and cell migration. Using a neuron–astrocyte model, we have reported that the neuronal protein Thy-1 engages αVβ3 integrin and syndecan-4 to induce RhoA activation and strong astrocyte adhesion to their underlying substrate. Thus, because cell–cell interactions and strong cell attachment to the matrix are considered antagonistic to cell migration, we hypothesized that Thy-1 stimulation of astrocytes should preclude cell migration. Here, we studied the effect of Thy-1 expressing neurons on astrocyte polarization and migration using a wound-healing assay and immunofluorescence analysis. Signaling molecules involved were studied by affinity precipitation, western blotting and the usage of specific antibodies. Intriguingly, Thy-1 interaction with its two receptors was found to increase astrocyte polarization and migration. The latter events required interactions of these receptors with both the RGD-like sequence and the heparin-binding domain of Thy-1. Additionally, prolonged Thy-1-receptor interactions inhibited RhoA activation while activating FAK, PI3K and Rac1. Therefore, sustained engagement of integrin and syndecan-4 with the neuronal surface protein Thy-1 induces astrocyte migration. Interestingly we identify here, a cell–cell interaction that despite initially inducing strong cell attachment, favors cell migration upon persistent stimulation by engaging the same signaling receptors and molecules as those utilized by the extracellular matrix proteins to stimulate cell movement.

Abstract: NOA1 is an evolutionary conserved, nuclear encoded GTPase essential for mitochondrial function and cellular survival. The function of NOA1 for assembly of mitochondrial ribosomes and regulation of OXPHOS activity depends on its GTPase activity, but so far no ligands have been identified that regulate the GTPase activity of NOA1. To identify nucleic acids that bind to the RNA-binding domain of NOA1 we employed SELEX (Systemic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment) using recombinant mouse wildtype NOA1 and the GTPase mutant NOA1-K353R. We found that NOA1 binds specifically to oligonucleotides that fold into guanine tetrads (G-quadruplexes). Binding of G-quadruplex oligonucleotides stimulated the GTPase activity of NOA1 suggesting a regulatory link between G-quadruplex containing RNAs, NOA1 function and assembly of mitochondrial ribosomes.

Abstract: The phosphoinositol-phospholipase C (PLC) family of enzymes consists of a number of isoforms, each of which has different cellular functions. PLCγ1 is primarily linked to tyrosine kinase transduction pathways, whereas PLCδ1 has been associated with a number of regulatory proteins, including those controlling the cell cycle. Recent studies have shown a central role of PLC in cell organisation and in regulating a wide array of cellular responses. It is of importance to define the precise role of each isoform, and how this changes the functional outcome of the cell. Here we investigated differences in PLC isoform levels and activity in relation to differentiation of human and rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Using Western blotting and PLC activity assay, we show that PLCδ1 and PLCγ1 are the predominant isoforms in randomly cycling human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMCs). Growth arrest of HVSMCs for seven days of serum deprivation was consistently associated with increases in PLCδ1 and SM α-actin, whereas there were no changes in PLCγ1 immuno-reactivity. Organ culture of rat mesenteric arteries in serum free media (SFM), a model of de-differentiation, led to a loss of contractility as well as a loss of contractile proteins (SM α-actin and calponin) and PLCδ1, and no change in PLCγ1 immuno-reactivity. Taken together, these data indicate that PLCδ1 is the predominant PLC isoform in vascular smooth muscle, and confirm that PLCδ1 expression is affected by conditions that affect the cell cycle, differentiation status and contractile function.

Abstract: At higher order levels chromatin is organized into loops. This looping, which plays an important role in transcription regulation and other processes, remains poorly understood. We investigated the kinetics of DNA loop migration during single cell gel electrophoresis (the comet assay). The migration of a part of the loops was shown to be reversible after switching off electrophoresis and to be sensitive to intercalation-induced changes in supercoiling. Another group of the loops migrates rapidly, the rate being insensitive to the supercoiling level. The largest part of the loops cannot migrate at all, presumably because of their large size. The loop ends can be detached in the presence of high concentrations of intercalators or protein denaturants, thus increasing the fraction of DNA that cannot migrate in the gel. The distribution of the loop length up to 100kilobases appears to be consistent with the fractal globule organization.

Abstract: Arsenic is a double-edge sword. On the one hand it is powerful carcinogen and on the other it is used therapeutically to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here we report that arsenic activates the iron responsive transcription factor, Aft1, as a consequence of a defective high-affinity iron uptake mediated by Fet3 and Ftr1, whose mRNAs are drastically decreased upon arsenic exposure. Moreover, arsenic causes the internalization and degradation of Fet3. Most importantly, fet3ftr1 mutant exhibits increased arsenic resistance and decreased arsenic accumulation over the wild-type suggesting that Fet3 plays a role in arsenic toxicity. Finally we provide data suggesting that arsenic also disrupts iron uptake in mammals and the link between Fet3, arsenic and iron, can be relevant to clinical applications.

Abstract: NF-κB is a transcription factor that integrates pro-inflammatory and pro-survival responses in diverse cell types. The activity of NF-κB is regulated in part by acetylation of its p65 subunit at lysine 310, which is required for transcription complex formation. De-acetylation at this site is performed by sirtuin 1(SIRT1) and possibly other sirtuins in an NAD+ dependent manner, such that SIRT1 inhibition promotes NF-κB transcriptional activity. It is unknown, however, whether changes in NAD+ levels can influence p65 acetylation and cellular inflammatory responses. Poly(ADP-ribose)-1 (PARP-1) is an abundant nuclear enzyme that consumes NAD+ in the process of forming (ADP-ribose)polymers on target proteins, and extensive PARP-1 activation can reduce intracellular NAD+ concentrations. Here we tested the idea that PARP-1 activation can regulate NF-κB transcriptional activity by reducing NAD+ concentrations and thereby inhibiting de-acetylation of p65. Primary astrocyte cultures were treated with the alkylating agent N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) to induce PARP-1 activation. This resulted in sustained acetylation of p65 and increased NF-κB transcriptional activity as monitored by a κB-driven eGFP reporter gene. These effects of MNNG were negated by a PARP-1 inhibitor, in PARP-1−/− cells, and in PARP-1−/− cells transfected with a catalytically inactive PARP-1 construct, thus confirming that these effects are mediated by PARP-1 catalytic activity. The effects of PARP-1 activation were replicated by a SIRT1 inhibitor, EX-527, and were reversed by exogenous NAD+. These findings demonstrate that PARP-1-induced changes in NAD+ levels can modulate NF-κB transcriptional activity through effects on p65 acetylation.

Abstract: The prominent role of Ca2+ in cell physiology is mediated by a whole set of proteins involved in Ca2+-signal generation, deciphering and arrest. Among these intracellular proteins, calmodulin (CaM) known as a prototypical calcium sensor, serves as a ubiquitous carrier of the intracellular calcium signal in all eukaryotic cell types. CaM is assumed to be involved in many diseases including Parkinson, Alzheimer, and rheumatoid arthritis. Defects in some of many reaction partners of CaM might be responsible for disease symptoms. Several classes of drugs bind to CaM with unwanted side effects rather than specific therapeutic use. Thus, it may be more promising to concentrate at searching for pharmacological interferences with the CaM target proteins, in order to find tools for dissecting and investigating CaM-regulatory and modulatory functions in cells. In the present study, we have established a screening assay based on fluorescence polarization (FP) to identify a diverse set of small molecules that disrupt the regulatory function of CaM. The FP-based CaM assay consists in the competition of two fluorescent probes and a library of chemical compounds for binding to CaM. Screening of about 5300 compounds (Strasbourg Academic Library) by displacement of the probe yielded 39 compounds in a first step, from which 6 were selected. Those 6 compounds were characterized by means of calorimetry studies and by competitive displacement of two fluorescent probes interacting with CaM. Moreover, those small molecules were tested for their capability to displace 8 different CaM binding domains from CaM. Our results show that these CaM/small molecules interactions are not functionally equivalent. The strategy that has been set up for CaM is a general model for the development and validation of other CaM interactors, to decipher their mode of action, or rationally design more specific CaM antagonists. Moreover, this strategy may be used for other protein binding assays intended to screen for molecules with preferred binding activity. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 12th European Symposium on Calcium.

Abstract: The mechanisms by which aldosterone increases Na+, K+ ATPase and sodium channel activity in cortical collecting duct and distal nephron have been extensively studied. Recent investigations demonstrate that aldosterone increases Na–H exchanger-3 (NHE-3) activity, bicarbonate transport, and H+ ATPase in proximal tubules. However, the role of aldosterone in regulation of Na+, K+ ATPase in proximal tubules is unknown. We hypothesize that aldosterone increases Na+, K+ ATPase activity in proximal tubules through activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Immunohistochemistry of kidney sections from human, rat, and mouse kidneys revealed that the MR is expressed in the cytosol of tubules staining positively for Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin and type IIa sodium-phosphate cotransporter (NpT2a), confirming proximal tubule localization. Adrenalectomy in Sprague–Dawley rats decreased expression of MR, ENaC α, Na+, K+ ATPase α1, and NHE-1 in all tubules, while supplementation with aldosterone restored expression of above proteins. In human kidney proximal tubule (HKC11) cells, treatment with aldosterone resulted in translocation of MR to the nucleus and phosphorylation of SGK-1. Treatment with aldosterone also increased Na+, K+ ATPase-mediated 86Rb uptake and expression of Na+, K+ ATPase α1 subunits in HKC11 cells. The effects of aldosterone on Na+, K+ ATPase-mediated 86Rb uptake were prevented by spironolactone, a competitive inhibitor of aldosterone for the MR, and partially by Mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) inhibitor. These results suggest that aldosterone regulates Na+, K+ ATPase in renal proximal tubule cells through an MR-dependent mechanism.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a central role in the co- and post-translational modification of many proteins. Disruption of these processes can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum — a condition known as endoplasmic reticulum stress. In recent years, the association of endoplasmic reticulum stress with a number of disease pathologies has increased interest in the study of this condition. Current methods to detect endoplasmic reticulum stress are indirect and retrospective. Here we describe a new method to detect and quantify endoplasmic reticulum stress in live cells using Thioflavin T (ThT), a small molecule that exhibits enhanced fluorescence when it binds to protein aggregates. We show that enhanced ThT-fluorescence correlates directly with established indicators of unfolded protein response activation. Furthermore, enhanced ThT-fluorescence can be detected in living cells within 20min of application of an endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing agent. ThT is capable of detecting endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by distinctly different conditions and compounds, in different cultured cell types as well as in mouse tissue samples. Pre-treatment with a potent endoplasmic reticulum stress-reducing agent, 4-phenylbutyric acid, mitigates the enhanced ThT signal. This new tool will be useful in future research investigating the role of protein misfolding in the development and/or progression of human diseases.

Abstract: We demonstrated that increasing intracellular cAMP concentrations result in the inhibition of migration of PANC-1 and other pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell types. The rise of cAMP was accompanied by rapid and reversible cessation of ruffling, by inhibition of focal adhesion turnover and by prominent loss of paxillin from focal adhesions. All these phenomena develop rapidly suggesting that cAMP effectors have a direct influence on the cellular migratory apparatus. The role of two primary cAMP effectors, exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) and protein kinase A (PKA), in cAMP-mediated inhibition of PDAC cell migration and migration-associated processes was investigated. Experiments with selective activators of EPAC and PKA demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of cAMP on migration, ruffling, focal adhesion dynamics and paxillin localisation is mediated by PKA, whilst EPAC potentiates migration.

Abstract: Muscle fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (ALDA) is a glycolytic enzyme which may localize both in nuclei and cytoplasm of cells, however its role in the nuclei is unclear. Here, we demonstrate the links between subcellular localization of ALDA and the cell cycle progression as well as the availability of energetic substrates. Results of our studies indicate that nuclear localization of ALDA correlates with the proliferative activity of the cells and with the expression of Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, both in the KLN-205 (mouse lung cancer cells) and human squamous cell lung cancer cells (hSCC). Chemically-induced block of cell cycle entry in S phase and the inhibition of transcription stimulate removal of ALDA from cells nuclei suggesting that nuclear ALDA is involved in cells proliferation. On the other hand, subcellular distribution of the enzyme also depends on the stress and pro-survival signals mediated by the Akt and the p38 pathways and, in non-proliferating cells, on the availability of glucose and lactate. The results presented here point to ALDA as a factor involved in the regulation of cells proliferation.

Abstract: Autophagy involves multiple membrane trafficking and fusion events. Annexin A7 (ANXA7) is postulated to play a role in membrane fusion during exocytosis, while the contribution of ANXA7 to autophagy is poorly understood. Our recent studies demonstrated that ABO could promote autophagy via elevation of ANXA7 and triggering ANXA7 subcellular redistribution. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms how ANXA7 regulates autophagy. As molecular disruption of ANXA7 in mice results in several unwished phenotypes, small molecule modulators may be efficacious in defining the mechanisms of ANXA7 action. However, so far no compounds that selectively target ANXA7 have been identified. So, we hypothesize that ABO might be a potent modulator of ANXA7. We also have detected the colocalization of ANXA7 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), and ANXA7 was essential for LC3 accumulation in VEC autophagy. As a GTPase, whether ANXA7 affects the phosphorylation of LC3 or other proteins needs further investigation. In this study, we performed site-directed mutagenesis and found that ABO directly bound to Thr286 of ANXA7 and inhibited its phosphorylation. By yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that ANXA7 could interact with grancalcin (GCA). ABO promoted the interaction and inhibited GCA phosphorylation, leading to the decrease of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. At the same time, ABO inhibited the phosphorylation of LC3. Hence, by identifying ABO as an unprecedented modulator of ANXA7 as well as GCA and LC3 as interacting proteins of ANXA7, we demonstrated the possible mechanisms how ANXA7 regulates autophagy for the first time.

Abstract: The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process involving the breakdown of cell–cell junctions and loss of epithelial polarity, is closely related to cancer development and metastatic progression. While the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a Cl− and HCO3− conducting anion channel expressed in a wide variety of epithelial cells, has been implicated in the regulation of epithelial polarity, the exact role of CFTR in the pathogenesis of cancer and its possible involvement in EMT process have not been elucidated. Here we report that interfering with CFTR function either by its specific inhibitor or lentiviral miRNA-mediated knockdown mimics TGF-β1-induced EMT and enhances cell migration and invasion in MCF-7. Ectopic overexpression of CFTR in a highly metastatic MDA-231 breast cancer cell line downregulates EMT markers and suppresses cell invasion and migration in vitro, as well as metastasis in vivo. The EMT-suppressing effect of CFTR is found to be associated with its ability to inhibit NFκB targeting urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), known to be involved in the regulation of EMT. More importantly, CFTR expression is found significantly downregulated in primary human breast cancer samples, and is closely associated with poor prognosis in different cohorts of breast cancer patients. Taken together, the present study has demonstrated a previously undefined role of CFTR as an EMT suppressor and its potential as a prognostic indicator in breast cancer.

Abstract: Recent evidences show that the localization of different plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases (PMCAs) is regulated in various complex, cell type-specific ways. Here we show that in low-density epithelial and endothelial cells PMCA4b localized mostly in intracellular compartments and its plasma membrane localization was enhanced upon increasing density of cells. In good correlation with the enhanced plasma membrane localization a significantly more efficient Ca2+ clearance was observed in confluent versus non-confluent HeLa cell cultures expressing mCherry-PMCA4b. We analyzed the subcellular localization and function of various C-terminally truncated PMCA4b variants and found that a truncated mutant PMCA4b-ct24 was mostly intracellular while another mutant, PMCA4b-ct48, localized more to the plasma membrane, indicating that a protein sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 1158–1181 contained a signal responsible for the intracellular retention of PMCA4b in non-confluent cultures. Alteration of three leucines to alanines at positions 1167–1169 resulted in enhanced cell surface expression and an appropriate Ca2+ transport activity of both wild type and truncated pumps, suggesting that the di-leucine-like motif 1167LLL was crucial in targeting PMCA4b. Furthermore, upon loss of cell–cell contact by extracellular Ca2+ removal, the wild-type pump was translocated to the early endosomal compartment. Targeting PMCA4b to early endosomes was diminished by the L1167–69A mutation, and the mutant pump accumulated in long tubular cytosolic structures. In summary, we report a di-leucine-like internalization signal at the C-tail of PMCA4b and suggest an internalization-mediated loss of function of the pump upon low degree of cell–cell contact.

Abstract: Processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases in neurons produces amyloid-β (Aβ), whose excess accumulation leads to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Knowledge on subcellular trafficking pathways of APP and its fragments is important for the understanding of AD pathogenesis. We designed fusion proteins comprising a C-terminal fragment of APP (app) and fluorescent proteins GFP (G) and DsRed (D) to permit the tracking of the fusion proteins and fragments in cells. CAD cells expressing these proteins emitted colocalized green and red fluorescence and produce ectodomains, sGapp and sRapp, and Aβ, whose level was reduced by inhibitors of β- and γ-secretases. The presence of GappR in endosomes was observed via colocalization with Rab5. These observations indicated that the fusion proteins were membrane inserted, transported in vesicles and proteolytically processed by the same mechanism for APP. By attenuating fusion protein synthesis with cycloheximide, individual fluorescent colors from the C-terminus of the fusion proteins appeared in the cytosol which was strongly suppressed by β-secretase inhibitor, suggesting that the ectodomains exit the cell rapidly (t1/2 about 20min) while the C-terminal fragments were retained longer in cells. In live cells, we observed the fluorescence of the ectodomains located between parental fusion proteins and plasma membrane, suggesting that these ectodomain positions are part of their secretion pathway. Our results indicate that the native ectodomain does not play a decisive role for the key features of APP trafficking and processing and the new fusion proteins may lead to novel insights in intracellular activities of APP.

Abstract: Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism whose deficiency in humans causes Friedreich ataxia. We performed transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of conditional Yeast Frataxin Homologue (Yfh1) mutants (tetO7-YFH1) to investigate metabolic remodeling upon Yfh1 depletion. These studies revealed that Yfh1 depletion leads to downregulation of many glucose-repressed genes. Most of them were Adr1 targets, a key transcription factor required for growth in non-fermentable carbon sources. Using a GFP-tagged Adr1, we observed that Yfh1 depletion promotes the export of Adr1 from the nucleus to the cytosol without affecting its protein levels. This effect was also observed upon H2O2 treatment, but not by iron overload/starvation, indicating the presence of a regulatory pathway involved in Adr1 export and inactivation upon stress conditions. We also observed that CTH2, a gene involved in the mRNA degradation of several iron-containing enzymes, was induced upon Yfh1 depletion. Accordingly, decreased levels of aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase were observed. Nevertheless, their levels were maintained in a Δcth2 mutant even in the absence of Yfh1. From these results we can conclude that, in addition to altering iron homeostasis, frataxin depletion involves drastic metabolic remodeling governed by Adr1 and Cth2 that finally leads to downregulation of iron–sulfur proteins and other proteins involved in respiratory metabolism.

Abstract: The mechanisms of programmed cell death activate genetically encoded intracellular programs in a controlled manner, the most common form being apoptosis. Apoptosis is carried out through a cascade of caspase mediated proteolytic cleavages initiated by the oligomerization of Bax, a cardinal regulator of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Heterologous expression of Bax in yeast causes cell death that shares a number of similarities to processes that occur in mammalian apoptosis. A screen of a cardiac cDNA library for suppressors of Bax-mediated apoptosis identified human septin7, a protein that belongs to the septin superfamily of conserved GTP-binding proteins that share a conserved cdc/septin domain. Analysis of the amino acid sequence deduced from the septin7 clone as well as the corresponding human septin7 gene revealed that a novel alternatively spliced transcript called septin7 variant4 (v4) was uncovered. Yeast cells overexpressing the human septin7 v4 cDNA were also capable of resisting copper-mediated cell death suggesting that it is not only a Bax suppressor but also an anti-apoptotic sequence. Analysis of septin7 function in a MCA1Δ yeast strain suggests that septin7 inhibits apoptosis in a caspase independent pathway. Overexpression of the yeast septin7 ortholog CDC10 also conferred resistance to the negative effects of copper as well as protecting cells from the overexpression of Bax. In contrast, septin7 was unable to prevent the increase in cell size associated with mutants lacking the endogenous yeast CDC10 gene. Taken together, our analysis suggests that anti-apoptosis is a novel yet evolutionarily conserved property of the septin7 sub-family of septins.

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate mediates activation of transcription factors CREB and ATF-1 via a Gα11-coupled receptor in the spermatogenic cell line GC-2,

Abstract: Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is a circulating steroid produced in the adrenal cortex, brain, and gonads. Whereas a series of investigations attest to neuroprotective effects of the steroid in the brain, surprisingly little is known about the physiological effects of DHEAS on cells of the reproductive system. Here we demonstrate that DHEAS acting on the spermatogenic cell line GC-2 induces a time- and concentration-dependent phosphorylation of c-Src and Erk1/2 and activates the transcription factors activating transforming factor-1 (ATF-1) and cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB). These actions are consistent with the non-classical signaling pathway of testosterone and suggest that DHEAS is a pro-androgen that is converted into testosterone in order to exert its biological activity. The fact, however, that steroid sulfatase mRNA was not detected in the GC-2 cells and the clear demonstration of DHEAS-induced activation of Erk1/2, ATF-1 and CREB after silencing the androgen receptor by small interfering RNA (siRNA) clearly contradict this assumption and make it appear unlikely that DHEAS has to be converted in the cytosol into a different steroid in order to activate the kinases and transcription factors mentioned. Instead, it is likely that the DHEAS-induced signaling is mediated through the interaction of the steroid with a membrane-bound G-protein-coupled receptor, since silencing of Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-11 (Gnα11) leads to the abolition of the DHEAS-induced stimulation of Erk1/2, ATF-1, and CREB. The investigation presented here shows a hormone-like activity of DHEAS on a spermatogenic cell line. Since DHEAS is produced in male and female reproductive organs, these findings could help to define new roles for DHEAS in the physiology of reproduction.

Abstract: Akt kinases are important mediators of the insulin signal, and some Akt substrates are directly involved in glucose homeostasis. Recently, Girdin has been described as an Akt substrate that is expressed ubiquitously in mammals. Cells overexpressing Girdin show an enhanced Akt activity. However, not much is known about Girdin's role in insulin signaling. We therefore analyzed the role of Girdin in primary human myotubes and found a correlation between Girdin expression and insulin sensitivity of the muscle biopsy donors, as measured by a hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp. To understand this finding on a cellular level, we then investigated the function of Girdin in C2C12 mouse myoblasts. Girdin knock-down reduced Akt and insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation. In contrast, stable overexpression of Girdin in C2C12 cells strikingly increased insulin sensitivity through a massive upregulation of the insulin receptor and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1. Furthermore, Akt and c-Abl kinases were constitutively activated. To investigate medium-term insulin responses we measured glucose incorporation into glycogen. The Girdin overexpressing cells showed a high basal glycogen synthesis that peaked already at 1nM insulin. Taken together, we characterized Girdin as a new and major regulator of the insulin signal in myoblasts and skeletal muscle.

Abstract: From the surrounding shell to the inner machinery, nuclear proteins provide the functional plasticity of the nucleus. This study highlights the nuclear association of Pore membrane (POM) protein NDC1 and Werner protein (WRN), a RecQ helicase responsible for the DNA instability progeria disorder, Werner Syndrome. In our previous publication, we connected the DNA damage sensor Werner's Helicase Interacting Protein (WHIP), a binding partner of WRN, to the NPC. Here, we confirm the association of the WRN/WHIP complex and NDC1. In established WRN/WHIP knockout cell lines, we further demonstrate the interdependence of WRN/WHIP and Nucleoporins (Nups). These changes do not completely abrogate the barrier of the Nuclear Envelope (NE) but do affect the distribution of FG Nups and the RAN gradient, which are necessary for nuclear transport. Evidence from WRN/WHIP knockout cell lines demonstrates changes in the processing and nucleolar localization of lamin B1. The appearance of “RAN holes” void of RAN corresponds to regions within the nucleolus filled with condensed pools of lamin B1. From WRN/WHIP knockout cell line extracts, we found three forms of lamin B1 that correspond to mature holoprotein and two potential post-translationally modified forms of the protein. Upon treatment with topoisomerase inhibitors lamin B1 cleavage occurs only in WRN/WHIP knockout cells. Our data suggest the link of the NDC1 and WRN as one facet of the network between the nuclear periphery and genome stability. Loss of WRN complex leads to multiple alterations at the NPC and the nucleolus.

Abstract: Trafficking of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) is regulated by specific interactions with other proteins and by post-translational mechanisms, such as phosphorylation. We have found that the type II cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGKII) phosphorylates GluA1 (formerly GluR1) at S845, augmenting the surface expression of AMPARs at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites. Activation of cGKII by 8-Br-cGMP enhances the surface expression of GluA1, whereas its inhibition or suppression effectively diminished the expression of this protein at the cell surface. In granule cells, NMDA receptor activation (NMDAR) stimulates nitric oxide and cGMP production, which in turn activates cGKII and induces the phosphorylation of GluA1, promoting its accumulation in the plasma membrane. GluA1 is mainly incorporated into calcium permeable AMPARs as exposure to 8-Br-cGMP or NMDA activation enhanced AMPA-elicited calcium responses that are sensitive to NASPM inhibition. We summarize evidence for an increase of calcium permeable AMPA receptors downstream of NMDA receptor activation that might be relevant for granule cell development and plasticity.

Abstract: Transcription factor FOXP3 (forkhead box P3) is found initially as a key regulator in regulatory T cells. Recently its expression has been demonstrated in some non-lymphoid normal and cancerous cells. Now FOXP3 has been proven to regulate cancer-related genes, especially suppressor genes in breast cancer. But the mechanisms by which FOXP3 regulates suppressor genes are not fully determined. In this study, we found the inverse correlation between FOXP3 and Ezh2, an enzyme for histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and a central epigenetic regulator in cancer. The overexpression of FOXP3 weakened Ezh2's enhancement on the mammosphere formation, cell proliferation, directional migration, and colony forming ability of T47D cells. We demonstrated that FOXP3 could downregulate Ezh2 protein level and this depended on not only the FOXP3 expression amount, but also the nuclear localization of FOXP3. More importantly, we demonstrated FOXP3 accelerated Ezh2 protein degradation through the polyubiquitination–proteasome pathway by enhancing the transcription of E3 ligase Praja1 directly. These results provided a new mechanism for FOXP3 in histone modifications as an Ezh2 suppressor and supported new evidence for FOXP3 as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer.

Expression of metastasin S100A4 is essential for bone resorption and regulates osteoclast function,

Abstract: Objective
S100A4 is a Ca-binding protein that regulates cell growth, survival, and motility. The abundant expression of S100A4 in rheumatiod arthritis contributes to the invasive growth of joint tissue and to bone damage. In the present study, we analysed the role of S100A4 in bone homeostasis.
Methods
Peripheral quantitative computed tomography and histomorphometric analysis were performed in mice lacking the entire S100A4 protein (S100A4KO) and in wild-type (WT) counterparts treated with shRNA-lentiviral constructs targeting S100A4 (S100A4-shRNA). Control groups consisted of sex-matched WT counterparts and WT mice treated with a non-targeting RNA construct.
Results
S100A4 deficiency was associated with higher trabecular and cortical bone mass, increased number and thickness of trabeculi combined with larger periosteal circumference and higher predicted bone strength. S100A4 inhibition by shRNA led to an increase in cortical bone in WT mice. S100A4-deficieny was associated with a reduced number of functional osteoclasts. S100A4KO and S100A4-shRNA-treated bone marrow progenitors gave rise to a large number of small TRAP+ cells with few nuclei and few pseudopodial processes. Poor osteoclastogenesis and the low resorptive capacity in S100A4Ko mice may be linked to low levels of surface integrins, impaired adhesion capacity, and poor multinucleation in S100A4-deficient osteoclasts, as well as a low content of proteolytic enzymes cathepsin K and MMP3 and MMP9 to break down the organic matrix.
Conclusion
S100A4 emerges as a negative regulator of bone metabolism potentially responsible for the excessive bone turnover in conditions marked by high levels of S100A4 protein, such as inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis.

Abstract: Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is one of the most important genetic contributors to Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, including macroautophagy. To test whether LRRK2 has a role in regulating autophagy, a specific inhibitor of the kinase activity of LRRK2 was applied to human neuroglioma cells and downstream readouts of autophagy examined. The resulting data demonstrate that inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity stimulates macroautophagy in the absence of any alteration in the translational targets of mTORC1, suggesting that LRRK2 regulates autophagic vesicle formation independent of canonical mTORC1 signaling. This study represents the first pharmacological dissection of the role LRRK2 plays in the autophagy/lysosomal pathway, emphasizing the importance of this pathway as a marker for LRRK2 physiological function. Moreover it highlights the need to dissect autophagy and lysosomal activities in the context of LRRK2 related pathologies with the final aim of understanding their aetiology and identifying specific targets for disease modifying therapies in patients.

Abstract: Syk is a 72kDa non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is best characterized in hematopoietic cells. While Syk is pro-tumorigenic in some cancer cell types, it also has been reported as a negative regulator of metastatic cell growth in others. An examination of the RelA (p65) subunit of NF-κB expressed in MCF7 breast cancer cells indicated that either treatment with pervanadate or stable expression of Syk protected RelA from calpain-mediated proteolysis. Similar results were observed with the tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B, another sensitive calpain substrate. The activity of calpain in MCF7 cell lysates was inhibited by both treatment with hydrogen peroxide and expression of Syk, the former due to oxidative inactivation of calpain and the latter to enhanced expression of calpastatin (CAST), the endogenous calpain inhibitor. The level of CAST was elevated in the cytosolic fraction of Syk-positive breast cancer cells resulting in more CAST present in complex with calpain in cell lysates. The high levels of CAST coincided with elevated basal levels of calcium–and of intracellular calpain activity–in Syk-expressing cells resulting from decreased levels of Bcl-2, an inhibitor of IP3-receptor-mediated calcium release. The inhibition of cellular calpain stimulated the Syk-mediated enhancement of NF-κB induced by TNF-α, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation resulting from integrin crosslinking, and increased the localization of Syk to the plasma membrane.

Abstract: The success of pharmacological treatments in primary liver cancers is limited by the marked efficacy of mechanisms of chemoresistance already present in hepatocytes. The role of the nuclear receptor FXR is unclear. Although, in non-treated liver tumors, its expression is reduced, the refractoriness to anticancer drugs is high. Moreover, the treatment with cisplatin up-regulates FXR. The aim of this study was to investigate whether FXR is involved in stimulating chemoprotection/chemoresistance in healthy and tumor liver cells. In human hepatocytes, the activation of FXR with the agonist GW4064 resulted in a significant protection against cisplatin-induced toxicity. In human hepatoma Alexander cells, with negligible endogenous expression of FXR, GW4064 also protected against cisplatin-induced toxicity, but only if they were previously transfected with FXR/RXR. Investigation of 109 genes potentially involved in chemoresistance revealed that only ABCB4, TCEA2, CCL14, CCL15 and KRT13 were up-regulated by FXR activation both in human hepatocytes and FXR/RXR-expressing hepatoma cells. In both models, cisplatin, even in the absence of FXR agonists, such as bile acids and GW4064, was able to up-regulate FXR targets genes, which was due to FXR-mediated trans-activation of response elements in the promoter region. FXR-dependent chemoprotection was also efficient against other DNA-damaging compounds, such as doxorubicin, mitomycin C and potassium dichromate, but not against non-genotoxic drugs, such as colchicine, paclitaxel, acetaminophen, artesunate and sorafenib. In conclusion, ligand-dependent and independent activation of FXR stimulates mechanisms able to enhance the chemoprotection of hepatocytes against genotoxic compounds and to reduce the response of liver tumor cells to certain pharmacological treatments.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer ranks fourth among cancer-related causes of death in North America. Minimal progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with late-stage tumors. Moreover, pancreatic cancer aggressiveness is closely related to high levels of pro-survival mediators, which can ultimately lead to rapid disease progression, resistance and metastasis. The main goal of this study was to define the mechanisms by which calix[6]arene, but not other calixarenes, efficiently decreases the aggressiveness of a drug resistant human pancreas carcinoma cell line (Panc-1). Calix[6]arene was more potent in reducing Panc-1 cell viability than gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil. In relation to the underlying mechanisms of cytotoxic effects, it led to cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase through downregulation of PIM1, CDK2, CDK4 and retinoblastoma proteins. Importantly, calix[6]arene abolished signal transduction of Mer and AXL tyrosine kinase receptors, both of which are usually overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. Accordingly, inhibition of PI3K and mTOR was also observed, and these proteins are positively modulated by Mer and AXL. Despite decreasing the phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308, calix[6]arene caused an increase in phosphorylation at Ser473. These findings in conjunction with increased BiP and IRE1-α provide a molecular basis explaining the capacity of calix[6]arene to trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagic cell death. Our findings highlight calix[6]arene as a potential candidate for overcoming pancreatic cancer aggressiveness. Importantly, we provide evidence that calix[6]arene affects a broad array of key targets that are usually dysfunctional in pancreatic cancer, a highly desirable characteristic for chemotherapeutics.

Abstract: The centrosome/basal body protein ODF2/Cenexin is necessary for the formation of the primary cilium. Primary cilia are essential organelles that sense and transduce environmental signals. Primary cilia are therefore critical for embryonic and postnatal development as well as for tissue homeostasis in adulthood. Impaired function of primary cilia causes severe human diseases. ODF2 deficiency prevents formation of the primary cilium and is embryonically lethal. To explore the regulation of primary cilia formation we analyzed the promoter region of Odf2 and its transcriptional activity. In cycling cells, Odf2 transcription is depressed but becomes up-regulated in quiescent cells. Low transcriptional activity is mediated by sequences located upstream from the basal promoter, and neither transcription factors with predicted binding sites in the Odf2 promoter nor Rfx3 or Foxj, which are known to control ciliary gene expression, could activate Odf2 transcription. However, co-expression of either C/EBPα, c-Jun or c-Jun and its regulator MEKK1 enhances Odf2 transcription in cycling cells. Our results provide the first analysis of transcriptional regulation of a ciliary gene. Furthermore, we suggest that transcription of even more ciliary genes is largely inhibited in cycling cells but could be activated by cell cycle arrest and by the stress signaling JNK pathway.

Abstract: A1/Bfl-1 is a NF-κB dependent, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that contains four Bcl-2 homology domains (BH) and an amphipathic C-terminal domain, and is expressed in endothelial cells (EC). Based on NF-κB reporter assays in bovine aortic EC, we have previously demonstrated that A1, like Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, inhibits NF-κB activation. These results, however, do not fully translate when evaluating the cell's own NF-κB machinery in human EC overexpressing A1 by means of recombinant adenovirus (rAd.) mediated gene transfer. Indeed, overexpression of full-length A1 in human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC), and human dermal microvascular EC (HDMEC) failed to inhibit NF-κB activation. However, overexpression of a mutant lacking the C-terminal domain of A1 (A1ΔC) demonstrated a potent NF-κB inhibitory effect in these cells. Disparate effects of A1 and A1ΔC on NF-κB inhibition in human EC correlated with mitochondrial (A1) versus non-mitochondrial (A1ΔC) localization. In contrast, both full-length A1 and A1ΔC protected EC from staurosporine (STS)-induced cell death, indicating that mitochondrial localization was not necessary for A1's cytoprotective function in human EC. In conclusion, our data uncover a regulatory role for the C-terminal domain of A1 in human EC: anchoring A1 to the mitochondrion, which conserves but is not necessary for its cytoprotective function, or by its absence freeing A1 from the mitochondrion and uncovering an additional anti-inflammatory effect.

Abstract: The stress-responsive, tumor suppressor N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (Ndrg2) is highly expressed in striated muscle. In response to anabolic and catabolic signals, Ndrg2 is suppressed and induced, respectively, in mouse C2C12 myotubes. However, little is known about the mechanisms regulating Ndrg2 expression in muscle, as well as the biological role for Ndrg2 in differentiated myotubes. Here, we show that Ndrg2 is a target of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) transcriptional program and is induced in response to endurance exercise, a physiological stress known also to increase PGC-1α/ERRα activity. Analyses of global gene and protein expression profiles in C2C12 myotubes with reduced levels of NDRG2, suggest that NDRG2 affects muscle growth, contractile properties, MAPK signaling, ion and vesicle transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Indeed, suppression of NDRG2 in myotubes increased protein synthesis and the expression of fast glycolytic myosin heavy chain isoforms, while reducing the expression of embryonic myosin Myh3, other contractile-associated genes and the MAPK p90 RSK1. Conversely, enhanced expression of NDRG2 reduced protein synthesis, and furthermore, partially blocked the increased protein synthesis rates elicited by a constitutively active form of ERRα. In contrast, suppressing or increasing levels of NDRG2 did not affect mRNA expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis that are regulated by PGC-1α or ERRα. This study shows that in C2C12 myotubes Ndrg2 is a novel PGC-1α/ERRα transcriptional target, which influences protein turnover and the regulation of genes involved in muscle contraction and function.

Abstract: We have recently found that the membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted organization-1 (MAGI-1) was enriched in rat nervous tissues such as the glomeruli in olfactory bulb of adult rats and dorsal root entry zone in spinal cord of embryonic rats. In addition, we revealed the localization of MAGI-1 in the growth cone of the primary cultured rat dorsal root ganglion cells. These results point out the possibility that MAGI-1 is involved in the regulation of neurite extension or guidance. In this study, we attempted to reveal the physiological role(s) of MAGI-1 in neurite extension. We found that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of MAGI-1 caused inhibition of nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. To clarify the involvement of MAGI-1 in NGF-mediated signal pathway, we tried to identify binding partners for MAGI-1 and identified p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a low affinity NGF receptor, and Shc, a phosphotyrosine-binding adaptor. These three proteins formed an immunocomplex in PC12 cells. Knockdown as well as overexpression of MAGI-1 caused suppression of NGF-stimulated activation of the Shc-ERK pathway, which is supposed to play important roles in neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. These results indicate that MAGI-1 may act as a scaffolding molecule for NGF receptor-mediated signaling pathway.

Abstract: Grb2-assosiated binder (Gab) family proteins are docking molecules that can interact with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytokine receptors and bind several downstream signalling proteins. Studies in several cell types have shown that Gab1 may have a role in signalling mediated by the two RTKs epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), but the involvement of Gab1 in EGFR and Met signalling has not been directly compared in the same cell. We have studied mechanisms of activation and role in mitogenic signalling of Gab1 in response to EGF and HGF in cultured rat hepatocytes. Gab1, but not Gab2, was expressed in the hepatocytes and was phosphorylated upon stimulation with EGF or HGF. Depletion of Gab1, using siRNA, decreased the ERK and Akt activation, cyclin D1 expression, and DNA synthesis in response to both EGF and HGF. Studies of mechanisms of recruitment to the receptors showed that HGF induced co-precipitation of Gab1 and Met while EGF induced binding of Gab1 to Grb2 but not to EGFR. Gab1 activation in response to both EGF and HGF was dependent on PI3K. While EGF activated Gab1 and Shc equally, within the same concentration range, HGF very potently and almost exclusively activated Gab1, having only a minimal effect on Shc. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that although Gab1 interacts differently with EGFR and Met, it is involved in mitogenic signalling mediated by both these growth factor receptors in hepatocytes.

Abstract: KLF10 is now classified as a member of the Krüppel-like transcription factor family and acts as a tumor suppressor. Although KLF10 is originally named as TGF-β-inducible early gene-1 and mimicking the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-β in various carcinoma cells, the transcriptional upregulatory function of KLF10 has been described for a variety of cytokines and in many diseases. Through in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation assays, we identified that KLF10 is a phosphorylated protein in cells. Using yeast-two hybrid screening and site direct mutagenesis, we also identified PIN1 as a novel KLF10 associated protein. PIN1 is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase enzyme belonging to the parvulin family, which specifically recognizes phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro containing substrates. Through protein–protein interaction assays, we showed that the Pro-directed Ser/Thr-Pro motif at Thr-93 in the KLF10 N-terminal region is essential for the interaction between KLF10 and PIN1. More importantly, PIN1 interacts with KLF10 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and this interaction promotes KLF10 protein degradation in cells. Therefore, KLF10 shows shorter protein stability compared with mutant KLF10 that lacks PIN1 binding ability after cycloheximide treatments. The reversely correlated expression profile between KLF10 and PIN1 as observed in cell lines was also shown in clinic pancreatic cancer specimen. Using in vitro kinase assays and depletion assays, we were able to show that RAF-1 phosphorylates the Thr-93 of KLF10 and affects the KLF10 expression level in cells. Thus these findings as a whole indicate that RAF-1 phosphorylation and PIN1 isomerization together regulate KLF10 stability and further affect the role of KLF10 in tumor progression.

Abstract: Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) was described as an activation and differentiation factor in T cells. NFAT1 protein is expressed in several cell types and has been implicated in the control of the cell cycle, death and migration. Overexpression or activation of NFAT1 has been demonstrated to induce cell death in different cell types, such as T lymphocytes, Burkitt's lymphoma, and fibroblasts. Although these findings indicate a role for NFAT1 transcription factor in control of cell death, the precise mechanisms involved in this process regulated by NFAT1 are still poorly understood. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is activated by many growth factors and cytokines that are important in driving proliferation and preventing apoptosis and is widely implicated in cell transformation and cancer development. We show that NFAT1 protein can cooperate with Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, but not with the JNK, p38 or NFκB pathways in cell death induction. NFAT1 can induce a cell death pathway consistent with apoptosis, which can be shifted to programmed necrosis by caspase inhibitors. Finally, through screening genes involved in cell death regulation, although we determined that TNF-α, TRAIL and PAK7 genes were up-regulated, only TNF-α expression was responsible for cell death in this context. These data suggest that NFAT1 protein activation can shift oncogenic Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling to acting as a tumor suppressor pathway. These data support a potential role for regulating NFAT1 expression in gene therapy in tumors that display an activated Ras pathway, which could lead to more specific, target-directed TNF-α expression and, thus, tumor suppression.

Abstract: The contribution of individual cysteine cathepsins as positive mediators of programmed cell death is dependent on several factors, such as the type of stimuli, intensity and duration of the stimulus, and cell type involved. Of the eleven human cysteine cathepsins, cathepsin F is the only cathepsin that exhibits an extended N-terminal proregion, which contains a cystatin-like domain. We predicted that the wild-type human cathepsin F contains three natively disordered regions within the enzyme's propeptide and various amino acid stretches with high fibrillation propensity. Wild-type human cathepsin F and its N-terminally truncated forms, Ala20–Asp484 (Δ19CatF), Pro126–Asp484 (Δ125CatF), and Met147–Asp484 (Δ146CatF) were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector and overexpressed in HEK 293T cells. Wild-type human cathepsin F displayed a clear vesicular labeling and colocalized with the LAMP2 protein, a lysosomal marker. However, all three N-terminally truncated forms of human cathepsin F were recovered as insoluble proteins, suggesting that the deletion of at least the signal peptides (Δ19CatF), results in protein aggregation. Noteworthy, they concentrated large perinuclear–juxtanuclear aggregates that accumulated within aggresome-like inclusions. These inclusions showed p62-positive immunoreactivity and were colocalized with the autophagy marker LC3B, but not with the LAMP2 protein. In addition, an approximately 2–3 fold increase in DEVDase activity was not sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death. These results suggested the clearance of the N-terminally truncated forms of human cathepsin F via the autophagy pathway, underlying its protective and prosurvival mechanisms.

Abstract: Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have been widely applied in several clinical trials of diseases, such as myocardial infarction, liver cirrhosis, neurodegenerative disease, and osteogenesis imperfecta. Although most studies demonstrated that transplantation of BM-MSCs did exert a temporary relief and short-term therapeutic effects, eventually all symptoms recur, therefore it is essential to improve the therapeutic efficacy of transplantation by either elevating the self-renewal of BM-MSCs or enhancing their survival rate. Herein we demonstrated that the BM-MSCs and adipocyte derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) isolated from the androgen receptor (AR) knockout mice have higher self-renewal ability than those obtained from the wild-type mice. Knockdown of AR in MSC cell lines exhibited similar results. Mechanistic dissection studies showed that the depletion of AR resulted in activation of Erk and Akt signaling pathways through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation or pathway to mediate higher self-renewal of BM-MSCs. Targeting AR signals using ASC-J9® (an AR degradation enhancer), hydroxyflutamide (antagonist of AR), and AR-siRNA all led to enhanced self-renewal of MSCs, suggesting the future possibility of using these anti-AR agents in therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: ADP plays critical signaling roles in the vascular endothelium. ADP receptors are targeted by several cardiovascular drugs, yet the intracellular pathways modulated by ADP are incompletely understood. These studies have identified important roles for the phosphatase PTEN in ADP-dependent modulation of the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) as well as of lipid and protein kinase pathways in endothelial cells. We find that ADP-promoted eNOS activation as well as phosphorylation of p38 MAPK are enhanced by siRNA-mediated PTEN knockdown. However, the increase in ADP-dependent eNOS activation promoted by PTEN knockdown is abrogated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of p38 MAPK. These findings indicate that PTEN tonically suppresses both p38 phosphorylation as well as ADP-stimulated eNOS activity. A key enzymatic activity of PTEN is its role as a lipid phosphatase, catalyzing the dephosphorylation of phosphoinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) to phosphoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). We performed biochemical analyses of cellular phospholipids in endothelial cells to show that siRNA-mediated PTEN knockdown leads to a marked increase in PIP3. Because these complex lipids activate the small GTPase Rac1, we explored the role of PTEN in ADP-modulated Rac1 activation. We used a FRET biosensor for Rac1 to show that ADP-dependent Rac1 activation is blocked by siRNA-mediated PTEN knockdown. We then exploited a FRET biosensor for PIP3 to show that the striking ADP-dependent increase in intracellular PIP3 is entirely blocked by PTEN knockdown. These studies identify a key role for PTEN in the modulation of lipid mediators involved in ADP receptor-regulated endothelial signaling pathways involving eNOS activation in vascular endothelial cells.

Abstract: Phosphate-activated mitochondrial glutaminase (GLS2) is suggested to be linked with elevated glutamine metabolism. It plays an important role in catalyzing the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate. The present study was to investigate the potent effect of GLS2 on radioresistance of cervical carcinoma. GLS2 was examined in 144 cases of human cervical cancer specimens (58 radioresistant specimens, 86 radiosensitive specimens) and 15 adjacent normal cervical specimens with immunohistochemistry. HeLa cells were treated with a cumulative dose of 50Gy X-rays, over 6months, yielding the resistant sub-line HeLaR. The expressions of GLS2 were measured by Western blot. Radioresistance was tested by colony survival assay. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. The levels of glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), NAD+/NADH ratio and NADP+/NADPH ratio were detected by quantization assay kit. Xenografts were used to confirm the effect of GLS2 on radioresistance in vivo. The expressions of GLS2 were significantly enhanced in tumor tissues of radioresistant patients compared with that in radiosensitive patients. In vitro, the radioresistant cell line HeLaR exhibited significantly increased GLS2 levels than its parental cell line HeLa. GLS2 silenced radioresistant cell HeLaR shows substantially enhanced radiosensitivity with lower colony survival and higher apoptosis in response to radiation. In vivo, xenografts with GLS2 silenced HeLaR were more sensitive to radiation. At the molecular level, knock-down of GLS2 increased the intracellular ROS levels of HeLaR exposed to irradiation by decreasing the productions of antioxidant GSH, NADH and NADPH. GLS2 may have an important role in radioresistance in cervical cancer patients.

Abstract: Hepatocellular apoptosis is an important pathological entity of alcoholic liver disease. Previously, we have shown that globular adiponectin (gAcrp) protects liver cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis by modulating an array of signaling pathways. In the present study, we investigated the role of autophagy induction by gAcrp in the suppression of ethanol-induced apoptosis and its potential mechanism(s) in liver cells. Here, we demonstrated that gAcrp significantly restores ethanol-induced suppression of autophagy-related genes, including Beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3B) both in primary rat hepatocytes and human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). Globular adiponectin also restored autophagosome formation suppressed by ethanol treatment in HepG2. Furthermore, inhibition of gAcrp-induced autophagic process by knock-down of LC3B prevented protection from ethanol-induced apoptosis. In particular, the autophagic process induced by gAcrp was involved in the suppression of ethanol-induced activation of caspase-8 and expression of Bax. Moreover, knock-down of AMPK by small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked gAcrp-induced expression of genes related to autophagy, which in turn prevented protection from ethanol-induced apoptosis, suggesting that AMPK plays an important role in the induction of autophagy and protection of liver cells by gAcrp. Finally, we also showed that gAcrp treatment induces translocation of the forkhead box O member protein, FoxO3A, into the nucleus, which may play a role in the induction of autophagy-related genes. Taken together, our data demonstrated that gAcrp protects liver cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis via induction of autophagy. Further, the AMPK-FoxO3A axis plays a cardinal role in gAcrp-induced autophagy and subsequent inhibition of ethanol-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Tendinopathies are a range of diseases characterised by degeneration and chronic tendon pain and represent a significant cause of morbidity. Relatively little is known about the underlying mechanisms; however onset is often associated with physical activity. A number of molecular changes have been documented in tendinopathy such as a decrease in overall collagen content, increased extracellular matrix turnover and protease activity. Metalloproteinases are involved in the homeostasis of the extracellular matrix and expression is regulated by mechanical strain. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of strain upon matrix turnover by measuring metalloproteinase and matrix gene expression and to elucidate the mechanism of action. Primary Human Achilles tenocytes were seeded in type I rat tail collagen gels in a Flexcell™ tissue train system and subjected to 5% cyclic uniaxial strain at 1Hz for 48h. TGFβ1 and TGFβRI inhibitor were added to selected cultures. RNA was measured using qRT-PCR and TGFβ protein levels were determined using a cell based luciferase assay. We observed that mechanical strain regulated the mRNA levels of multiple protease and matrix genes anabolically, and this regulation mirrored that seen with TGFβ stimulation alone. We have also demonstrated that the inhibition of the TGFβ signalling pathway abrogated the strain induced changes in mRNA and that TGFβ activation, rather than gene expression, was increased with mechanical strain. We concluded that TGFβ activation plays an important role in mechanotransduction. Targeting this pathway may have its place in the treatment of tendinopathy.

Abstract: The ER is a continuous membrane system consisting of the nuclear envelope, flat sheets often studded with ribosomes, and a polygonal network of highly-curved tubules extending throughout the cell. Although protein and lipid biosynthesis, protein modification, vesicular transport, Ca2+dynamics, and protein quality control have been investigated in great detail, mechanisms that generate the distinctive architecture of the ER have been uncovered only recently. Several protein families including the reticulons and REEPs/DP1/Yop1p harbor hydrophobic hairpin domains that shape high-curvature ER tubules and mediate intramembrane protein interactions. Members of the atlastin/RHD3/Sey1p family of dynamin-related GTPases interact with the ER-shaping proteins and mediate the formation of three-way junctions responsible for the polygonal structure of the tubular ER network, with Lunapark proteins acting antagonistically. Additional classes of tubular ER proteins including some REEPs and the M1 spastin ATPase interact with the microtubule cytoskeleton. Flat ER sheets possess a different complement of proteins such as p180, CLIMP-63 and kinectin implicated in shaping, cisternal stacking and cytoskeletal interactions. The ER is also in constant motion, and numerous signaling pathways as well as interactions among cytoskeletal elements, the plasma membrane, and organelles cooperate to position and shape the ER dynamically. Finally, many proteins involved in shaping the ER network are mutated in the most common forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia, indicating a particular importance for proper ER morphology and distribution in large, highly-polarized cells such as neurons. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Functional and structural diversity of endoplasmic reticulum.

Abstract: TTF-1 is an important transcription factor in lung development and lung disease and is essential for lung cell differentiation, specifically surfactant protein (Sftp) expression. The molecular mechanisms that drive the expression and transcriptional control of TTF-1 are not fully understood. In the fetal lung, ErbB4 functions as a transcriptional co-factor and regulates the timely onset of fetal Sftp expression. We speculate that ErbB4 is an upstream regulator of TTF-1 and regulates Sftpb expression via this pathway in alveolar type II cells. Neuregulin-induced ErbB4 and TTF-1 signaling interactions were studied by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. Overexpression of ErbB4 and TTF-1 was analyzed in its effect on cell viability, Sftpb expression, TTF-1 expression, and Sftpb and TTF-1 promoter activity. The effect of ErbB4 deletion and ErbB4 nuclear translocation on TTF-1 expression was studied in primary fetal type II epithelial cells, isolated from transgenic HER4heart(−/−) mice. ErbB4 ligand neuregulin induces ErbB4 and TTF-1 co-precipitation and nuclear colocalization. Combined ErbB4 and TTF-1 overexpression inhibits cell viability, while promoting Sftpb expression more than single overexpression of each protein. NRG stimulates TTF-1 expression in ErbB4-overexpressing epithelial cells, while this effect is absent in ErbB4-depleted cells. In primary fetal type II cells, ErbB4 nuclear translocation is critical for its regulation of TTF-1-induced Sftpb upregulation. TTF-1 overexpression did not overcome this important requirement. We conclude that ErbB4 is a critical upstream regulator of TTF-1 in type II epithelial cells and that this interaction is important for Sftpb regulation.

Abstract: The importin (IMP) superfamily of nuclear transport proteins is essential to key developmental pathways, including in the murine testis where expression of the 6 distinct IMPα proteins is highly dynamic. Present predominantly from the spermatocyte stage onwards, IMPα4 is unique in showing a striking nuclear localization, a property we previously found to be linked to maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and to the cellular stress response in cultured cells. Here we examine the role of IMPα4 in vivo for the first time using a novel transgenic mouse model in which we overexpress an IMPα4–EGFP fusion protein from the protamine 1 promoter to recapitulate endogenous testicular germ cell IMPα4 expression in spermatids. IMPα4 overexpression did not affect overall fertility, testis morphology/weight or spermatogenic progression under normal conditions, but conferred significantly (>30%) increased resistance to oxidative stress specifically in the spermatid subpopulation expressing the transgene. Consistent with a cell-specific role for IMPα4 in protecting against oxidative stress, haploid germ cells from IMPα4 null mice were significantly (c. 30%) less resistant to oxidative stress than wild type controls. These results from two unique and complementary mouse models demonstrate a novel protective role for IMPα4 in stress responses specifically within haploid male germline cells, with implications for male fertility and genetic integrity.

Abstract: ZIC3, an X-linked zinc finger transcription factor, was the first identified gene involved in establishing normal left–right patterning in humans. Mutations in the Zic3 gene in patients cause heterotaxy, which includes congenital heart defects. However, very little is known about how the function of the ZIC3 protein is regulated. Sumoylation is a posttranslational modification process in which a group of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins is covalently attached to targets via a series of enzymatic reactions. Here, we report for the first time that sumoylation targets human ZIC3 primarily on the consensus lysine residue K248, which is critical for the nuclear retention of ZIC3. Consequently, SUMO modification potentiates the repressive activity of ZIC3 on the promoter of its target gene cardiac α-actin, and the mutation of lysine 248 to arginine (K248R) abolishes its repressive function. We further revealed that ZIC3 variants with mutations found in human patients with congenital anomalies exhibit aberrant sumoylation activity, which at least partially accounts for their cytoplasmic diffusion. Improved sumoylation of human disease-associated ZIC3 variants reestablishes their nuclear occupancy in the presence of SUMO E3 ligase and SUMO-1. Thus, the altered sumoylation status of ZIC3 underpins the developmental abnormalities associated with these ZIC3 mutants. The SUMO targeting consensus sequence in ZIC3 is highly conserved in its paralogs and orthologs, pointing to sumoylation as a general mechanism underlying the functional control of ZIC proteins. This study provides a potential therapeutic strategy to regain the normal subcellular distribution and function of ZIC3 mutants by restoring SUMO conjugation.

Abstract: Despite its potential side effects of addiction, tolerance and withdrawal symptoms, morphine is widely used for reducing moderate and severe pain. Previous studies have shown that the analgesic effect of morphine depends on mu opioid receptor (MOR) expression levels, but the regulatory mechanism of MOR is not yet fully understood. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is closely associated with neuropathic hyperalgesia, which closely resembles the neuroplastic changes observed with morphine antinociceptive tolerance. In this study, we show that inhibition of JNK by SP600125, its inhibitory peptide, or JNK-1 siRNA induced MOR at both mRNA and protein levels in neuronal cells. This increase in MOR expression was reversed by inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, but not by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) pathway. Further experiments using cell signaling inhibitors showed that MOR upregulation by JNK inhibition involved nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). The p38 MAPK dependent phosphorylation of p65 NF-κB subunit in the nucleus was increased by SP600125 treatment. We also observed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis that JNK inhibition led to increased bindings of CBP and histone-3 dimethyl K4, and decreased bindings of HDAC-2, MeCP2, and histone-3 trimethyl K9 to the MOR promoter indicating a transcriptional regulation of MOR by JNK inhibition. All these results suggest a regulatory role of the p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways in MOR gene expression and aid to our better understanding of the MOR gene regulation.

Abstract: The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), located at the outer mitochondria membrane (OMM), mediates interactions between mitochondria and other parts of the cell by transporting anions, cations, ATP, Ca2+, and metabolites. Substantial evidence points to VDAC1 as being a key player in apoptosis, regulating the release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria, such as cytochrome c, and interacting with anti-apoptotic proteins. Recently, we demonstrated that VDAC1 oligomerization is a general mechanism common to numerous apoptogens acting via different initiating cascades and proposed that a protein-conducting channel formed within a VDAC1 homo/hetero oligomer mediates cytochrome c release. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for VDAC1 oligomerization remains unclear. Several studies have shown that mitochondrial Ca2+ is involved in apoptosis induction and that VDAC1 possesses Ca2+-binding sites and mediates Ca2+ transport across the OMM. Here, the relationship between the cellular Ca2+ level, [Ca2+]i, VDAC1 oligomerization and apoptosis was studied. Decreasing [Ca2+]i using the cell-permeable Ca2+ chelating reagent BAPTA-AM was found to inhibit VDAC1 oligomerization and apoptosis, while increasing [Ca2+]i using Ca2+ ionophore resulted in VDAC1 oligomerization and apoptosis induction in the absence of apoptotic stimuli. Moreover, induction of apoptosis elevated [Ca2+]i, concomitantly with VDAC1 oligomerization. AzRu-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport decreased VDAC1 oligomerization, suggesting that mitochondrial Ca2+ is required for VDAC1 oligomerization. In addition, increased [Ca2+]i levels up-regulate VDAC1 expression. These results suggest that Ca2+ promotes VDAC1 oligomerization via activation of a yet unknown signaling pathway or by increasing VDAC1 expression, leading to apoptosis.

Abstract: Apoptosis signaling crucially depends on caspase activities. Caspase-2 shares features of both initiator and effector caspases. Opinions are divided on whether caspase-2 activity is established during apoptosis initiation or execution in response to DNA damage, death receptor stimulation, or heat shock. So far, approaches towards measuring caspase-2 activity were restricted to analyses in cell homogenates and extracts, yielded inconsistent results, and were often limited in sensitivity, thereby contributing to controversies surrounding the role of caspase-2 during apoptosis. Furthermore, caspases overlap in substrate specificities, and caspase-8 as well as effector caspases may cleave the optimal VDVAD recognition motif as well. We therefore generated a highly sensitive Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrate to determine the relative contribution of these caspases to VDVADase activity non-invasively inside living cells. We observed limited proteolysis of the substrate during apoptosis initiation in response to death receptor stimulation by FasL, TNFα and TRAIL. However, this activity was attributable to caspase-8 rather than caspase-2. Likewise, no caspase-2-specific activity was detected during apoptosis initiation in response to genotoxic stress (cisplatin, 5-FU), microtubule destabilization (vincristine), or heat shock. The contribution of caspase-2 to proteolytic activities during apoptosis execution was insignificant. Since even residual, ectopically introduced caspase-2 activity could readily be detected inside living cells in our measurements, we conclude, in contrast to several previous studies, that caspase-2 activity does not contribute to apoptosis in the scenarios investigated, and that instead caspase-8 and effector caspases are the most significant VDVADases during canonical apoptosis signaling.

Abstract: MOZ and MLL encoding a histone acetyltransferase and a histone methyltransferase, respectively, are targets for recurrent chromosomal translocations found in acute myeloblastic or lymphoblastic leukemia. We have previously shown that MOZ and MLL cooperate to activate HOXA9 gene expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitors cells. To dissect the mechanism of action of this complex, we decided to identify new proteins interacting with MOZ. We found that the scaffold protein Symplekin that supports the assembly of polyadenylation machinery was identified by mass spectrometry. Symplekin interacts and co-localizes with both MOZ and MLL in immature hematopoietic cells. Its inhibition leads to a decrease of the HOXA9 protein level but not of Hoxa9 mRNA and to an over-recruitment of MOZ and MLL onto the HOXA9 promoter. Altogether, our results highlight the role of Symplekin in transcription repression involving a regulatory network between MOZ, MLL and Symplekin.

Abstract: Snf1, the yeast AMP-activated kinase homolog, regulates the expression of several genes involved in adaptation to glucose limitation and in response to cellular stresses. We previously demonstrated that Snf1 interacts with Swi6, the regulatory subunit of SBF and MBF complexes, and activates CLB5 transcription. Here we report that, in α-factor synchronized cells in 2% glucose, the loss of the Snf1 catalytic subunit impairs the binding of SBF and MBF complexes and the subsequent recruitment of the FACT complex and RNA Polymerase II to promoters of G1-genes. By using an analog-sensitive allele of SNF1, SNF1as(I132G), encoding a protein whose catalytic activity is selectively inhibited in vivo by 2-naphthylmethyl pyrazolopyrimidine 1, we show that the inhibition of Snf1 catalytic activity affects the expression of G1-genes causing a delayed entrance into S phase in cells synchronized in G1 phase by α-factor treatment or by elutriation. Moreover, Snf1 is detected in immune complexes of Rpb1, the large subunit of RNA Polymerase II, and is present at both promoters and coding regions of SBF- and MBF-regulated genes 20min after α-factor release, suggesting a direct role for Snf1 in the activation of the G1-regulon transcription.

Abstract: The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a macromolecular assembly consisting of approximately 30 different proteins called nucleoporins. Several nucleoporins are O-GlcNAcylated, which is a post-translational modification in which the monosaccharide β-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is attached to serine or threonine residues within proteins. However, the biological significance of this modification on nucleoporins remains obscure. Here we found that Nup62 and Nup88 protein levels were significantly decreased upon knockdown of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which catalyzes the O-GlcNAcylation of intracellular proteins. Although Nup88, unlike Nup62, was not recognized by an anti-O-GlcNAc antibody or WGA–HRP, knockdown of Nup62 caused a reduction in Nup88 protein levels, suggesting that the observed decrease in Nup88 in OGT knocked-down cells is due to a decrease in Nup62. Furthermore, we found that Nup88 was preferentially associated with O-GlcNAcylated Nup62 compared with non-O-GlcNAcylated Nup62. These results indicate that Nup62 protein levels are primarily maintained by O-GlcNAcylation and that Nup88 is quantitatively regulated through its interaction with O-GlcNAcylated Nup62.

Abstract: Numerous studies have reported associations between IGF-I and other extra cellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including fibronectin (FN), integrins, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) and through IGFBPs, with vitronectin (VN). Nevertheless, the precise nature and mechanisms of these interactions are still being characterised. In this paper, we discuss transglutaminases (TGases) as a constituent of the ECM and provide evidence for the first time that IGF-I is a lysine (K)-donor substrate to TGases. When IGF-I was incubated with an alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor-derived Q peptide in the presence of tissue transglutaminase (TG2), an IGF-I:Q peptide cross-linked species was detected using Western immunoblotting and confirmed by mass spectrometry. Similar findings were observed in the presence of Factor XIIIa (FXIIIa) TGase. To identify the precise location of this K-donor TGase site/s on IGF-I, all the three IGF-I K-sites, individually and collectively (K27, K65 and K68), were substituted to arginine (R) using site-directed mutagenesis. Incubation of these K→R IGF-I analogues with Q peptide in the presence of TG2 or FXIIIa resulted in the absence of cross-linking in IGF-I analogues bearing arginine substitution at site 68. This established that K68 within the IGF-I D-domain was the principal K-donor site to TGases. We further annotated the functional significance of these K→R IGF-I analogues on IGF-I mediated actions. IGF-I analogues with K→R substitution within the D-domain at K65 and K68 hindered migration of MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells and correspondingly reduced PI3-K/AKT activation. Therefore, this study also provides first insights into a possible functional role of the previously uncharacterised IGF-I D-domain.

Abstract: A role for annexin A7 (A7) is postulated in the obligatory fusion between lamellar bodies and the plasma membrane during surfactant secretion in alveolar type II cells. This study investigated if surfactant secretagogues increase cell surface A7, which could support A7 insertion into plasma membrane as annexin proteins reportedly lack membrane penetration ability. In vivo trafficking of A7 to cell surface was determined by immuno-staining after non-permeabilizing fixation of alveolar type II cells. Stimulation with various secretagogues increased protein kinase-dependent staining for A7 and ABCA3 in comparison to control cells. Biotin-labeling of surface proteins showed ~4% of total A7 in control cells, which increased ~3–4 folds in stimulated type II cells. Increased cell surface A7 was also observed by protein cross-linking studies showing ~70kDa A7-adduct in the membranes but not in the cytosol fraction of PMA- or A23187-stimulated cells. In vitro phosphorylation increased the Ca2+-dependent binding of recombinant A7 to lung plasma membranes; and subsequent cross-linking showed increased levels of ~70kDa A7-adduct. PMA-stimulation of type II cells increased A7 trafficking to lipid rafts suggesting that the latter are involved in A7 trafficking to the cell surface. However, in vitro membrane insertion of recombinant A7 and its tryptophan mutants as determined by fluorescence quenching with doxylPC suggested only shallow membrane insertion by A7. Together, our studies support in vivo association between surfactant secretion and cell surface A7 occurring by insertion into plasma membrane and by fusion of A7 containing lamellar bodies.

Abstract: The attachment of organelles to the cytoskeleton and directed organelle transport is essential for cellular morphology and function. In contrast to other cell organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus, peroxisomes are evenly distributed in the cytoplasm, which is achieved by binding of peroxisomes to microtubules and their bidirectional transport by the microtubule motor proteins kinesin-1 (Kif5) and cytoplasmic dynein. KifC3, belonging to the group of C-terminal kinesins, has been identified to interact with the human peroxin PEX1 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. We investigated the potential involvement of KifC3 in peroxisomal transport. Interaction of KifC3 and the AAA-protein (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) PEX1 was confirmed by in vivo colocalization and by coimmunoprecipitation from cell lysates. Furthermore, knockdown of KifC3 using RNAi resulted in an increase of cells with perinuclear-clustered peroxisomes, indicating enhanced minus-end directed motility of peroxisomes. The occurrence of this peroxisomal phenotype was cell cycle phase independent, while microtubules were essential for phenotype formation. We conclude that KifC3 may play a regulatory role in minus-end directed peroxisomal transport for example by blocking the motor function of dynein at peroxisomes. Knockdown of KifC3 would then lead to increased minus-end directed peroxisomal transport and cause the observed peroxisomal clustering at the microtubule-organizing center.

Abstract: BAG3 plays a regulatory role in a number of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and migration, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), autophagy activation, and virus infection. The AP-1 transcription factors are implicated in a variety of important biological processes including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and oncogenesis. Recently, it has been reported that AP-1 protein c-Jun inhibits autophagy and enhances apoptotic cell death mediated by starvation. However, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. For the first time, the current study demonstrated that serum starvation downregulated BAG3 at the transcriptional level via c-Jun. In addition, the current study reported that BAG3 stabilized JunD mRNA, which was, at least in part, responsible for the promotion of serum starvation mediated-growth inhibition by BAG3.

Abstract: Tight control between activation and attenuation of granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) signaling is essential to regulate survival, proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells. Previous studies demonstrated negative regulation of G-CSFR through endosomal–lysosomal routing and ubiquitin–proteasome mediated degradation. However, very few E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to target G-CSFR for ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Here we identified F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbw7), a substrate recognizing component of Skp–Cullin–F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin Ligase physically associates with G-CSFR and promotes its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Our data shows that Fbw7 also interacts with and degrades G-CSFR-T718 (a truncated mutant of G-CSFR found in severe congenital neutropenia/acute myeloid leukemia (SCN/AML patients)) though at a quite slower rate compared to G-CSFR. We further show that glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), like Fbw7 also targets G-CSFR and G-CSFR-T718 for degradation; however, Fbw7 and GSK3β are interdependent in targeting G-CSFR/G-CSFR-T718 for degradation because they are unable to degrade G-CSFR individually when either of them is knocked down. We further show that Fbw7 mediated downregulation of G-CSFR inhibits signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation which is required for G-CSF dependent granulocytic differentiation. In addition, our data also shows that inhibition of Fbw7 restores G-CSFR signaling leading to enhanced STAT3 activity resulting in massive granulocytic differentiation. These data indicate that Fbw7 together with GSK3β negatively regulates G-CSFR expression and its downstream signaling.

Abstract: Inducing tumor cell death is one of the major therapeutic strategies in treating cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanism underlying the involvement of autophagy in cell death induced by timosaponin AIII (TAIII). Cell viability was determined by MTT and cologenic assay; apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay; autophagy was examined by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence; ubiquitination was detected by co-immunoprecipitation; mRNA expression was detected by real-time PCR; and determination of necrotic cell death was approached with LDH assay. The in vivo tumor growth inhibition was determined by xenograft model. TAIII exhibits potent cytotoxicity on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells without severe hepatic toxicity. TAIII induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in HCC, and the induction of apoptosis was attributed to the inhibition of TAIII on XIAP expression. Repressing XIAP expression allowed cell tolerance toward the treatment with TAIII. The suppression of XIAP by TAIII is under post-transcriptional control and independent of proteasomal-driven proteolysis. Instead, TAIII-induced AMPKα/mTOR-dependent autophagy was responsible for XIAP suppression and triggered the XIAP heading lysosomal degradation pathway. Ubiquitination of IAPs is required for the autophagic degradation induced by TAIII. Blockade of autophagy turns on the switch of necrotic cell death in TAIII-treated cells. Timosaponin AIII induces HCC cell apoptosis through a p53-independent mechanism involving XIAP degradation through autophagy–lysosomal pathway. The possibility of developing TAIII as a new anti-tumor agent is worth considering.

Abstract: High-temperature requirement protein A2 (HtrA2), a serine protease, localizes in the mitochondria and has diverse roles, including maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis and regulation of cellular apoptosis. HtrA2 (also known as Omi) is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson disease. By employing agarose gel electrophoresis, a fluorescent dye, PicoGreen, intercalation into mtDNA, and long-range PCR (LR-PCR), we showed that mitochondrial DNA conformational stability is related to HtrA2. Nicked forms of mtDNA were produced through reactive oxygen species generated by loss of HtrA2 protease activity, and mtDNA mutations frequently occurred in HtrA2−/− cells, but not in HtrA2+/+ cells. We found conformational changes in mtDNA from the brain tissue of mnd2 mutant mice that lack the serine protease activity of HtrA2. Overexpression of HtrA2 with protease activity targeted to mitochondria only was able to restore mtDNA conformational stability in HtrA2−/− MEF cells. Nuclear-encoded mtDNA repair genes, including POLG2, Twinkle, and APTX1, were significantly upregulated in HtrA2−/− cells. Electron microscopy showed that mitochondrial morphology itself was not affected, even in HtrA2−/− cells. Our results demonstrate that HtrA2 deficiency causes mtDNA damage through ROS generation and mutation, which may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent triggering of cell death in aging cells.

Abstract: Bcl-2 associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) has a modular structure that contains a BAG domain, a WW domain, a proline-rich (PxxP) domain to mediate potential interactions with chaperons and other proteins that participate in more than one signal transduction. In search for novel interacting partners, the current study identified that 78kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) was a novel partner interacting with BAG3. Interaction between GRP78 and BAG3 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown. We also identified that the ATPase domain of GRP78 and BAG domain of BAG3 mediated their interaction. Counterintuitive for a prosurvival protein, BAG3 was found to promote the cytotoxicity of breast cancer MCF7, thyroid cancer FRO and glioma U87 cells subjected to genotoxic stress. In addition, the current study demonstrated that BAG3 interfered with the formation of the antiapoptotic GRP78-procaspase-7 complex, which resulted in an increased genotoxic stress-induced cytotoxicity in cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of GRP78 significantly blocked the enhancing effects of BAG3 on activation of caspase-7 and induction of apoptosis by genotoxic stress. Overall, these results suggested that through direct interaction BAG3 could prevent the antiapoptotic effect of GRP78 upon genotoxic stress.

Abstract: RhoA is a small GTPase multifunctional protein that regulates cell proliferation and cytoskeletal reorganization. Regulation of its protein stability plays an important role in its biological functions. We have shown that a Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) FBXL19 E3 ubiquitin ligase targets Rac1, a related member of the Rho family for ubiquitination and degradation. Here, SCFFBXL19 mediates RhoA ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in lung epithelial cells. Ectopically expressed FBXL19 decreased RhoA wild type, active, and inactive forms. Cellular depletion of FBXL19 increased RhoA protein levels and extended its half-life. FBXL19 bound the small GTPase in the cytoplasm leading to RhoA ubiquitination at Lys135. A RhoAK135R mutant protein was resistant to SCFFBXL19-mediated ubiquitination and degradation and exhibited a longer lifespan. Protein kinase Erk2-mediated phosphorylation of RhoA was both sufficient and required for SCFFBXL19-mediated RhoA ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, SCFFBXL19 targets RhoA for its disposal, a process regulated by Erk2. Ectopically expressed FBXL19 reduced phosphorylation of p27 and cell proliferation, a process mediated by RhoA. Further, FBXL19 cellular expression diminished lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) and stress fiber formation. Hence, SCFFBXL19 functions as a RhoA antagonist during cell proliferation and cytoskeleton rearrangement. These results provide the first evidence of an F-box protein targeting RhoA thereby modulating its cellular lifespan that impacts cell proliferation and cytoskeleton rearrangement.

Abstract: Glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), a p160 family nuclear receptor co-activator protein, has three activation domains that recruit at least three secondary co-activators: CBP/p300, co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1, and coiled-coil co-activator, which exhibits histone acetyltransferase and/or arginine methyltransferase activities. The regulatory mechanisms underlying the co-activation functions of GRIP1, which associates with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in PML-nuclear bodies, are not well-understood. This study showed that PML specifically and dramatically enhanced the C-terminal transactivation activity of GRIP1 by directly binding to GRIP1 but only when it was sumoylated. Most of the transactivation activity resided in the N-terminal PML regions that are conserved among isoforms. Three N-terminal sumoylation residues (Lys 65, 160, and 490) exhibited differential roles in the regulation of GRIP1 activity, and the sumoylation of Lys 490 acted as the primary nuclear localization signal of PML. While GRIP1 transactivation was stimulated to a similar degree by PML (K490R), located in the nucleus, and wild-type PML, PML (K490D) and the C-truncated mutant PML1–489 both displayed an epinuclear localization and were mostly inactive in stimulating GRIP. Based on these data, nuclear foci, nuclear localization, and the sumoylation status of Lys 490 were not essential for the enhancement of GRIP1 activity by PML, but the charge status of Lys 490 was important for subcellular localization of PML and cross-talk between its N- and C-terminal regions to modulate transcriptional activation. Taken together, these results provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms of PML that control the functional activities of GRIP1.

PRIMA-1 induces autophagy in cancer cells carrying mutant or wild type p53,

Abstract: PRIMA-1 is a chemical compound identified as a growth suppressor of tumor cells expressing mutant p53. We previously found that in the MDA-MB-231 cell line expressing high level of the mutant p53-R280K protein, PRIMA-1 induced p53 ubiquitination and degradation associated to cell death. In this study, we investigated the ability of PRIMA-1 to induce autophagy in cancer cells. In MDA-MB-231 and HCT116 cells, expressing mutant or wild type p53, respectively, autophagy occurred following exposure to PRIMA-1, as shown by acridine orange staining, anti-LC3 immunofluorescence and immunoblots, as well as by electron microscopy. Autophagy was triggered also in the derivative cell lines knocked-down for p53, although to a different extent than in the parental cells expressing mutant or wild type p53. In particular, while wild type p53 limited PRIMA-1 induced autophagy, mutant p53 conversely promoted autophagy, thus sustaining cell viability following PRIMA-1 treatment. Therefore, the autophagic potential of PRIMA-1, besides being cell context dependent, could be modulated in a different way by the presence of wild type or mutant p53. Furthermore, since both cell lines lacking p53 were more sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of PRIMA-1 than the parental ones, our findings suggest that a deregulated autophagy may favor cell death induced by this drug.

Abstract: The pharmacological modulation of renoprotective factor vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in the proximal tubule has therapeutic interest. In human proximal tubular HK-2 cells, treatment with all-trans retinoic acid or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) triggers the production of VEGF-A. The pathway involves an initial increase in intracellular PGE2, followed by activation of EP receptors (PGE2 receptors, most likely an intracellular subset) and increase in retinoic acid receptor-β (RARβ) expression. RARβ then up-regulates transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which increases the transcription and production of VEGF-A. Here we studied the role in this pathway of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) transactivation by EP receptors. We found that EGFR inhibitor AG1478 prevented the increase in VEGF-A production induced by PGE2- and all-trans retinoic acid. This effect was due to the inhibition of the transcriptional up-regulation of RARβ, which resulted in loss of the RARβ-dependent transcriptional up-regulation of HIF-1α. PGE2 and all-trans retinoic acid also increased EGFR phosphorylation and this effect was sensitive to antagonists of EP receptors. The role of intracellular PGE2 was indicated by two facts; i) PGE2-induced EGFR phosphorylation was substantially prevented by inhibitor of prostaglandin uptake transporter bromocresol green and ii) all-trans retinoic acid treatment, which enhanced intracellular but not extracellular PGE2, had lower effect on EGFR phosphorylation upon pre-treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac. Thus, EGFR transactivation by intracellular PGE2-activated EP receptors results in the sequential activation of RARβ and HIF-1α leading to increased production of VEGF-A and it may be a target for the therapeutic modulation of HIF-1α/VEGF-A.

Abstract: The pp32 (ANP32A) gene acts as a tumor suppressor while its closely related homologue pp32r1 (ANP32C) is oncogenic and is overexpressed in breast, prostate and pancreatic tumors. The transduction of p53wt cell lines (ACHN and HeLa) with pp32r1 or pp32r1Y140H lentivirus increased the proliferation of p53wt cell lines compared to the untransduced control cells while transduction of the p53R248W MiaPaCa2 cell line had no effect. Cell cycle analysis of transduced ACHN cells by PI staining and BrdU incorporation illustrated a pronounced shift toward the S-phase of the cell cycle in cells overexpressing the pp32r1 and pp32r1Y140H proteins. Confocal microscopy and western blotting demonstrated that pp32r1 and the pp32r1Y140H mutant protein reside predominantly in the cytoplasm in constrast to pp32 which is a nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling protein. To determine the effects of pp32r1 or pp32r1Y140H overexpression at the proteomic level we performed a comprehensive proteome analysis on ACHN, ACHN-pp32r1 and ACHN-pp32r1Y140H cell lysates using the isotope-coded protein label (ICPL) method. Among those proteins with >40% regulation were Macrophage Capping protein (CAPG) and Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4) proteins which were significantly upregulated by pp32r1 and pp32r1Y140H overexpression. This increase in CHD4 also appears to influence a number of cell cycle regulator genes including; p53, p21 and cyclinD1 as judged by western blotting. Silencing of CHD4 in ACHN-pp32r1Y140H cells using specific shRNA reverted the cell cycle dysregulation caused by pp32r1Y140H expression to that of the untransduced ACHN cell line, suggesting that CHD4 is the prominant effector of the pp32r1/pp32r1Y140H phenotype.

Abstract: Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) play key roles in the development of diabetic vascular complications by activating the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. Here, we identified an increase of the migratory properties of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) through AGE-induced expression of lipocalin-2 (LCN2). Because the AGE-elicited expression of LCN2 was diminished by an antibody against the AGE receptor (RAGE), diphenylene iodonium (DPI), N-acetyl cysteine, LY294002, and SP600125, we suggest that AGEs enhance the expression of LCN2 via a RAGE-NADPH oxidase-reactive oxygen species pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of PI3K-Akt and JNK in HASMCs. In addition, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and promoter assay revealed that CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β is crucial for AGE-induced expression of LCN2. However, any other AGE-related signaling pathway, including ERK1/2, p38, NF-κB, and AP-1, did not affect the AGE- induced expression of LCN2. Knockdown of LCN2 expression by shRNA showed that AGE-elicited LCN2 expression enhanced the invasive and migratory properties of HASMCs, but showed no effect on cell proliferation. Considering the importance of HASMC migration in the development of atherosclerosis, our study provides a novel insight into diabetic vascular complications.

Abstract: The beta3 adrenergic receptor (B3-AR) reportedly induces cell proliferation, but the signaling pathways that were proposed, involving either Gs or Gi coupling, remain controversial. To further investigate the role of G protein coupling in B3-AR induced proliferation, we stimulated primary human myometrial smooth muscle cells with SAR150640 (B3-AR agonist) in the absence or presence of variable G-protein inhibitors. Specific B3-AR stimulation led to an Erk1/2 induced proliferation. We observed that the proliferative effects of B3-AR require two Erk1/2 activation peaks (the first after 3min, the second at 8h). Erk1/2 activation at 3min was mimicked by forskolin (adenylyl-cyclase activator), and was resistant to pertussis toxin (Gi inhibitor), suggesting a Gs protein signaling. This first signaling also required the downstream Gs signaling effectors PKA and Src. However, Erk1/2 activation at 8h turned out to be pertussis toxin-dependent, and PKA-independent, indicating a Gi signaling pathway in which Src and PI3K were required. The pharmacological inhibition of both the Gs and Gi pathway abolished B3-AR-induced proliferation. Altogether, these data indicate that B3-AR-induced proliferation depends on the biphasic activation of Erk1/2 sequentially induced by the Gs/PKA/Src and Gi/Src/PI3K signaling pathways.

Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that parathyroid hormone (PTH) induces apoptosis in human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells but the effects of its tumoral analog PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) in this cell line are still unknown. In the present work we investigated whether PTHrP, as PTH, is able to induce Caco-2 cell apoptosis or if it exerts protective effects under apoptotic conditions. Using Caco-2 cells cultured under serum deprivation in the presence or absence of PTHrP we demonstrated that, differently to PTH, its analog employed at the same concentration (10−8M) is not a pro-apoptotic hormone. Cells were exposed to an oxidative insult in the form of hydrogen peroxide to induce apoptosis, which leads to a 50% loss of cell viability determined by MTS assay, morphological changes observed under fluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis. Herein we demonstrate, for the first time, that pre-treatment with PTHrP prior to H2O2 incubation, prevents cell death induced by the apoptotic inductor; and using specific inhibitors we evidenced that protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) mediate this anti-apoptotic effect. Also, we found that PTHrP decreases the pro-apoptotic protein BAX levels and increases the protein expression of the anti-apoptotic HSP27. Immunoblot analysis revealed that H2O2 increases the phosphorylation levels of AKT and MAPKs, exhibiting a cellular defense response; and consequently increases phospho-BAD levels. The H2O2-induced activation of protein kinases is reverted when cells are pre-treated with PTHrP. Altogether these results evidence a protective effect of PTHrP under apoptotic conditions in intestinal cells, which may be mediated by AKT and MAPKs.

Abstract: In order to investigate whether and how a modification of mitochondrial metabolism can affect yeast sensitivity to programmed cell death (PCD) induced by acetic acid (AA-PCD), yeast cells were grown on raffinose, as a sole carbon source, which, differently from glucose, favours mitochondrial respiration. We found that, differently from glucose-grown cells, raffinose-grown cells were mostly resistant to AA-PCD and that this was due to the activation of mitochondrial retrograde (RTG) response, which increased with time, as revealed by the up-regulation of the peroxisomal isoform of citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase isoform 1, RTG pathway target genes. Accordingly, the deletion of RTG2 and RTG3, a positive regulator and a transcription factor of the RTG pathway, resulted in AA-PCD, as shown by TUNEL assay. Neither deletion in raffinose-grown cells of HAP4, encoding the positive regulatory subunit of the Hap2,3,4,5 complex nor constitutive activation of the RTG pathway in glucose-grown cells due to deletion of MKS1, a negative regulator of RTG pathway, had effect on yeast AA-PCD. The RTG pathway was found to be activated in yeast cells containing mitochondria, in which membrane potential was measured, capable to consume oxygen in a manner stimulated by the uncoupler CCCP and inhibited by the respiratory chain inhibitor antimycin A. AA-PCD resistance in raffinose-grown cells occurs with a decrease in both ROS production and cytochrome c release as compared to glucose-grown cells en route to AA-PCD.

Abstract: Trypanosomatids contain peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. Peroxisomal biogenesis involves a cytosolic receptor, PEX5, which, after its insertion into the organellar membrane, delivers proteins to the matrix. In yeasts and mammalian cells, transient PEX5 monoubiquitination at the membrane serves as the signal for its retrieval from the organelle for re-use. When its recycling is impaired, PEX5 is polyubiquitinated for proteasomal degradation. Stably monoubiquitinated TbPEX5 was detected in cytosolic fractions of Trypanosoma brucei, indicative for its role as physiological intermediate in receptor recycling. This modification's resistance to dithiothreitol suggests ubiquitin conjugation of a lysine residue. T. brucei PEX4, the functional homologue of the ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) enzyme responsible for PEX5 monoubiquitination in yeast, was identified. It is associated with the cytosolic face of the glycosomal membrane, probably anchored by an identified putative TbPEX22. The involvement of TbPEX4 in TbPEX5 ubiquitination was demonstrated using procyclic ∆PEX4 trypanosomes. Surprisingly, glycosomal matrix protein import was only mildly affected in this mutant. Since other UBC homologues were upregulated, it might be possible that these have partially rescued PEX4's function in PEX5 ubiquitination. In addition, the altered expression of UBCs, notably of candidates involved in cell-cycle control, could be responsible for observed morphological and motility defects of the ∆PEX4 mutant.

Abstract: The deregulation of B cell differentiation has been shown to contribute to autoimmune disorders, hematological cancers, and aging. We provide evidence that the retinoic acid-producing enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1) is an oncogene suppressor in specific splenic IgG1+/CD19− and IgG1+/CD19+ B cell populations. Aldh1a1 regulated transcription factors during B cell differentiation in a sequential manner: 1) retinoic acid receptor alpha (Rara) in IgG1+/CD19− and 2) zinc finger protein Zfp423 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg) in IgG1+/CD19+ splenocytes. In Aldh1a1−/− mice, splenic IgG1+/CD19− and IgG1+/CD19+ B cells acquired expression of proto-oncogenic genes c-Fos, c-Jun, and Hoxa10 that resulted in splenomegaly. Human multiple myeloma B cell lines also lack Aldh1a1 expression; however, ectopic Aldh1a1 expression rescued Rara and Znf423 expressions in these cells. Our data highlight a mechanism by which an enzyme involved in vitamin A metabolism can improve B cell resistance to oncogenesis.

Abstract: Neurturin (NRTN), a member of the GDNF family of ligands (GFL), is currently investigated in a series of clinical trials for Parkinson's disease. NRTN signals through its cognate receptor GFRα2 and co-receptor RET to induce neurite outgrowth, but the underlying mechanism remains to be better understood. STAT3 was previously shown to be activated by oncogenic RET, independent of ligand and GFRα. In this study, we demonstrated that NRTN induced serine727 but not tyrosine705 phosphorylation of STAT3 in primary cortical neuron and neuronal cell lines. Remarkably, STAT3 phosphorylation was found to be mediated specifically by GFRα2c and RET9 isoforms. Furthermore, serine but not tyrosine dominant negative mutant of STAT3 impaired NRTN induced neurite outgrowth, indicative of the role of STAT3 as a downstream mediator of NRTN function. Similar to NGF, the NRTN induced P-Ser-STAT3 was localized to the mitochondria but not to the nucleus. Mitochondrial STAT3 was further found to be intimately involved in NRTN induced neurite outgrowth. Collectively, these findings demonstrated the hitherto unrecognized and novel role of specific GFRα2 and RET isoforms in mediating NRTN activation of STAT3 and the transcription independent mechanism whereby the mitochondria localized P-Ser-STAT3 mediated NRTN induced neurite outgrowth.

Abstract: Mechanical forces induced by interstitial fluid flow in and surrounding tissues and by blood/lymphatic flow in vessels may modulate cancer cell invasion and metastasis and anticancer drug delivery. Our previous study demonstrated that laminar flow-induced shear stress induces G2/M arrest in tumor cells. However, whether shear stress modulates final cell fate remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of flow-induced shear stress in modulating the survival of four human tumor cell lines, i.e., Hep3B hepatocarcinoma cells, MG63 osteosarcoma cells, SCC25 oral squamous carcinoma cells, and A549 carcinomic alveolar basal epithelial cells. Laminar shear stress (LSS) ranging from 0.5 to 12dyn/cm2 induced death of these four tumor cell lines. In contrast to LSS at 0.5dyn/cm2, oscillatory shear stress (OSS) at 0.5±4dyn/cm2 cannot induce cancer cell death. Both LSS and OSS had no effect on human normal hepatocyte, lung epithelial, and endothelial cells. Application of LSS to these four cell lines increased the percentage of cells stained positively for annexin V–FITC, with up-regulations of cleaved caspase-8, -9, and -3, and PARP. In addition, LSS also induced Hep3B cell autophagy, as detected by acidic vesicular organelle formation, LC3B transformation, and p62/SQSTM1 degradation. By transfecting with small interfering RNA, we found that the shear-induced apoptosis and autophagy are mediated by bone morphogenetic protein receptor type (BMPR)-IB, BMPR-specific Smad1 and Smad5, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in Hep3B cells. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which shear stress induces apoptosis and autophagy in tumor cells.

Abstract: Actin, a constituent of the cytoskeleton, is now recognized to function in the nucleus in gene transcription, chromatin remodeling and DNA replication/repair. Actin shuttles in and out of the nucleus through the action of transport receptors importin-9 and exportin-6. Here we have addressed the impact of cell cycle progression and DNA replication stress on actin nuclear localization, through study of actin dynamics in living cells. First, we showed that thymidine-induced G1/S phase cell cycle arrest increased the nuclear levels of actin and of two factors that stimulate actin polymerization: IQGAP1 and Rac1 GTPase. When cells were exposed to hydroxyurea to induce DNA replication stress, the nuclear localization of actin and its regulators was further enhanced. We employed live cell photobleaching assays and discovered that in response to DNA replication stress, GFP-actin nuclear import and export rates increased by up to 250%. The rate of import was twice as fast as export, accounting for actin nuclear accumulation. The faster shuttling dynamics correlated with reduced cellular retention of actin, and our data implicate actin polymerization in the stress-dependent uptake of nuclear actin. Furthermore, DNA replication stress induced a nuclear shift in IQGAP1 and Rac1 with enhanced import dynamics. Proximity ligation assays revealed that IQGAP1 associates in the nucleus with actin and Rac1, and formation of these complexes increased after hydroxyurea treatment. We propose that the replication stress checkpoint triggers co-ordinated nuclear entry and trafficking of actin, and of factors that regulate actin polymerization.

Abstract: Notch signaling plays a pivotal role in embryonic and postnatal development. Upon binding of a Notch ligand, proteolytic cleavage events liberate the Notch-intracellular domain (NICD) that migrates into the nucleus. In order to activate target genes, NICD associates with the transcription factor RBP-J (also known as CSL), Mastermind and the acetyltransferase p300. Here, we identify the DEAD-box RNA helicase Ddx5 as a novel component of the RBP-J/NICD complex utilizing a biotinylation-tagging approach followed by mass-spectrometry. Biochemical assays confirm a direct interaction of Ddx5 with RBP-J. We show that Ddx5 localizes at RBP-J binding sites within the Notch target genes preTCRα, Hes1 and CD25 in a Notch-dependent manner. Moreover, knockdown of Ddx5 also downregulates a subset of Notch target genes in a murine pre T-cell model. Interestingly, also knockdown/overexpression of the RNA coactivator SRA, a cofactor of Ddx5, downregulates Hes1 and preTCRα. Using Chromatin-IP, we show that this effect is accompanied with a loss of p300 occupancy at Notch target genes and decreased histone acetylation. Together, our data demonstrate that Ddx5 and SRA function as coactivators of Notch signaling.

Abstract: We recently identified several Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBP) from the S100 and annexin family to be regulated by TSH in FRTL-5 cells. Here, we study the regulation of S100A4, S100A6 and ANXA2 in primary human thyrocytes (PHT) derived from surrounding tissues (ST), cold benign thyroid nodules (CTN) and autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN). We investigated the expression and regulation of CaBP and the effect of their expression on Ca2+ and TSHR signaling. We used an approach that accounts for the potential of an individual PHT culture to proliferate or to express thyroid differentiation features by assessing the expression of FOS and TPO. We found a strong correlation between the regulation of CaBP and the proliferation-associated transcription factor gene FOS. PKA and MEK1/2 were regulators of ANXA2 expression, while PI3-K and triiodothyronine were additionally involved in S100 regulation. The modulated expression of CaBP was reflected by changes in ATP-elicited Ca2+ signaling in PHT. S100A4 increased the ratio of subsequent Ca2+ responses and showed a Ca2+ buffering effect, while ANXA2 affected the first Ca2+ response to ATP. Overexpression of S100A4 led to a reduced activation of NFAT by TSH. Using S100A4 E33Q, D63N, F72Q and Y75K mutants we found that the effects of S100A4 expression on Ca2+ signaling are mediated by protein interaction. We present evidence that TSH has the ability to fine-tune Ca2+ signals through the regulation of CaBP expression. This represents a novel putative cross-regulating mechanism in thyrocytes that could affect thyrocyte signaling and physiology.

Abstract: TGFBI, a transforming growth factor β-induced extracellular matrix protein, circulates at a level of ~300ng/ml in humans and modulates several integrin-mediated cellular functions. The protein contains an N-terminal EMI domain, four consecutive FAS1 domains, and the RGD motif. Each FAS1 domain and the RGD motif have been known to interact with avb3 integrin. Here, we found that the binding affinity (Kd) of TGFBI for αvβ3 integrin was approximately 3.8×10−8M, a value ~2300-fold higher than that of a single FAS1 domain, and demonstrated that this greater affinity was due to the cooperative action of the four FAS1 domains and the RGD motif. Moreover, TGFBI exhibited more potent anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic activities, even at a 100-fold lower molar dose than the reported effective dose of the FAS1 domain. Finally, our data showed that TGFBI specifically targeted the tumor vasculature and accumulated at the tumor site. Collectively, our results support the theory that TGFBI acts as a potent endogenous anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic molecule by targeting αvβ3 integrin, and highlights the importance of physiological circulating TGFBI levels in inhibiting tumor growth.

Abstract: Glycosylation plays a role in regulating many biological activities, including protein folding and cell surface expression of biomolecules. However, the importance of glycosylation for KCC4 function has not previously been demonstrated. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the four putative extracellular N-linked glycosylation sites of KCC4 to determine the role of these sites in KCC4 half-life, cell surface expression, and transporter activity, as well as in KCC4-dependent tumor formation. We showed that triple (N312/331/344/Q) and quadruple (N312/331/344/360/Q) mutations of N-linked glycosylation sites disrupt the N-linked glycosylation of KCC4, resulting in the accumulation of KCC4, predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and not at the cell surface. Further investigation indicated that mutations of the central two (N331/344/Q) N-linked glycosylation sites inhibit the membrane trafficking of KCC4. Our data suggest that the glycan moieties at the N331 and N344 sites were Endo H-resistant, complex-form structures, and that the N312 and N360 sites were Endo H-sensitive, high mannose-containing structures. Under hypotonic stress conditions, the ability to adapt to changes in intracellular chloride ion concentrations and RVD (regulatory volume decrease) activities were less efficient in cells containing the deglycosylated form of KCC4 that were not expressed at the cell surface. Deglycosylated forms of KCC4 also demonstrated decreased tumor formation and lung colonization in mouse xenografts. The difference in glycan complexity may account for the differential impact of each branch on the biological effects of KCC4. We propose that glycosylation is essential for the surface expression, stabilization, and bioactivity of KCC4.

Abstract: Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) plays an important role in lung fibrosis. In this study, we investigated the role of Rac1, mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in CTGF-induced collagen I expression in human lung fibroblasts. CTGF caused concentration- and time-dependent increases in collagen I expression. CTGF-induced collagen I expression was inhibited by the dominant negative mutant (DN) of Rac1 (RacN17), MLK3DN, MLK3 inhibitor (K252a), JNK1DN, JNK2DN, a JNK inhibitor (SP600125), and an AP-1 inhibitor (curcumin). Treatment of cells with CTGF caused activation of Rac1, MLK3, JNK, and AP-1. The CTGF-induced increase in MLK3 phosphorylation was inhibited by RacN17. Treatment with RacN17 and the MLK3DN inhibited CTGF-induced JNK phosphorylation. CTGF caused increases in c-Jun phosphorylation and the recruitment of c-Jun and c-Fos to the collagen I promoter. Furthermore, stimulation of cells with the CTGF resulted in increases in AP-1-luciferase activity; this effect was inhibited by Rac1N17, MLK3DN, JNK1DN, and JNK2DN. Moreover, CTGF-induced α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression was inhibited by the procollagen I small interfering RNA (siRNA). These results suggest for the first time that CTGF acting through Rac1 activates the MLK3/JNK signaling pathway, which in turn initiates AP-1 activation and recruitment of c-Jun and c-Fos to the collagen I promoter and ultimately induces collagen I expression in human lung fibroblasts.

Abstract: Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a master regulator of genes involved in unfolded protein response (UPR) and its translation is regulated through reinitiation at upstream open reading frames. Here, we demonstrate internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation of an alternatively spliced variant of human ATF4. This variant that contains four upstream open reading frames in the 5′ leader region was expressed in leukocytes and other tissues. mRNA and protein expression of this variant was activated in the UPR. Its translation was neither inhibited by steric hindrance nor affected by eIF4G1 inactivation, indicating a cap-independent and IRES-dependent mechanism not mediated by ribosome scanning-reinitiation. The IRES activity mapped to a highly structured region that partially overlaps with the third and fourth open reading frames was unlikely attributed to cryptic promoter or splicing, but was activated by PERK-induced eIF2α phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings reveal a new mechanism for translational regulation of ATF4 in mammalian UPR.

Abstract: Membrane protein insertion and topogenesis generally occur at the Sec61 translocon in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. During this process, membrane spanning segments may adopt two distinct orientations with either their N- or C-terminus translocated into the ER lumen. While different topogenic determinants in membrane proteins, such as flanking charges, polypeptide folding, and hydrophobicity, have been identified, it is not well understood how the translocon and/or associated components decode them. Here we present evidence that the translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex is involved in membrane protein topogenesis in vivo. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of the TRAP complex in HeLa cells enhanced the topology effect of mutating the flanking charges of a signal-anchor, but not of increasing signal hydrophobicity. The results suggest a role of the TRAP complex in moderating the ‘positive-inside’ rule.

Abstract: Tumor cell migration is a crucial step in the metastatic cascade, and interruption of this step is considered to be logically effective in preventing tumor metastasis. Lipid rafts, distinct liquid ordered plasma membrane microdomains, have been shown to influence cancer cell migration, but the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. Here, we report that lipid rafts regulate the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion in human melanoma cell migration. Disrupting the integrity of lipid rafts with methyl-β cyclodextrin enhances actin stress fiber formation and inhibits focal adhesion disassembly, accompanied with alterations in cell morphology. Furthermore, actin cytoskeleton, rather than microtubules, mediates the lipid raft-dependent focal adhesion disassembly by regulating the dephosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins and the internalization of β3 integrin. We also show that Src–RhoA–Rho kinase signaling pathway is responsible for lipid raft disruption-induced stress fiber formation. Taken together, these observations provide a new mechanism to further explain how lipid rafts regulate the migration of melanoma cell and suggest that lipid rafts may be novel and attractive targets for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Randomly spread fibroblasts on fibronectin-coated elastomeric membranes respond to cyclic strain by a varying degree of focal adhesion assembly and actin reorganization. We speculated that the individual shape of the cells, which is linked to cytoskeletal structure and pre-stress, might tune these integrin-dependent mechanotransduction events. To this aim, fibronectin circles, squares and rectangles of identical surface area (2000μm2) were micro-contact printed onto elastomeric substrates. Fibroblasts plated on these patterns occupied the corresponding shapes. Cyclic 10% equibiaxial strain was applied to patterned cells for 30min, and changes in cytoskeleton and cell-matrix adhesions were quantified after fluorescence staining. After strain, megakaryocytic leukemia-1 protein translocated to the nucleus in most cells, indicating efficient RhoA activation independently of cell shape. However, circular and square cells (with radial symmetry) showed a significantly greater increase in the number of actin stress fibers and vinculin-positive focal adhesions after cyclic strain than rectangular (bipolar) cells of identical size. Conversely, cyclic strain induced larger changes in pY397-FAK positive focal complexes and zyxin relocation from focal adhesions to stress fibers in bipolar compared to symmetric cells. Thus, radially symmetric cells responded to cyclic strain with a larger increase in assembly, whereas bipolar cells reacted with more pronounced reorganization of actin stress fibers and matrix contacts. We conclude that integrin-mediated responses to external mechanical strain are differentially modulated in cells that have the same spreading area but different geometries, and do not only depend on mere cell size.

Abstract: Although Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been implicated in the regulation of stem cell functions, their role in osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) has not been reported. We found that ASCs express a restricted subset of TLRs, including TLR1–TLR5, and that TLR agonists such as Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2 agonist), polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (TLR3 agonist), lipopolysaccharide (TLR4 agonist), and flagellin (TLR5 agonist), but not R848 (TLR7/8 agonist), consistently induced osteogenic differentiation in murine-derived ASCs, which coincided with the TLR expression pattern of ASCs. Cytokine expression profiles induced by TLR agonists and results from subsequent functional assays indicated that interleukin-6 (IL-6) together with soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) enhanced osteogenic differentiation of ASCs by activating STAT3. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated STAT3-silencing blunted osteogenesis and the expression of osteogenic markers, whereas STAT3 overexpression resulted in an increase in osteogenesis. Consistently, STAT3 inhibitor treatment reduced osteogenesis, STAT3 phosphorylation, and expression of osteogenic markers including osterix. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that STAT3 binding to the STAT3-binding sites on the osterix promoter increased during IL-6-stimulated osteogenesis. Our results thus establish TLRs as novel regulators of ASCs which signal through IL-6/STAT3 pathway and induce osterix expression as a part of the osteogenesis.

Abstract: CCN4 is a cysteine-rich protein that belongs to the Cyr61, CTGF, Nov family of matricellular proteins. Here, we investigated the intracellular signaling pathways involved in CCN4-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression in human osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts. Stimulation of OASFs with CCN4 induced VCAM-1 expression. CCN4-induced VCAM-1 expression was attenuated by αvβ5 or α6β1 integrin antibody, Syk inhibitor, PKCδ inhibitor (rottlerin), JNK inhibitor (SP600125), and AP-1 inhibitors (curcumin and tanshinone). Stimulation of cells with CCN4 increased Syk, PKCδ, and JNK activation. Treatment of OASFs with CCN4 also increased c-Jun phosphorylation, AP-1-luciferase activity, and c-Jun binding to the AP-1 element in the VCAM-1 promoter. Moreover, up-regulation of VCAM-1 increased the adhesion of monocytes to OASF monolayers, and this adhesion was attenuated by transfection with a VCAM-1 siRNA. Our results suggest that CCN4 increases VCAM-1 expression in human OASFs via the Syk, PKCδ, JNK, c-Jun, and AP-1 signaling pathways. The CCN4-induced VCAM-1 expression promoted monocyte adhesion to human OASFs.

Abstract: RNAi is a highly conserved mechanism in almost every eukaryote with a few exceptions including the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A recent study showed that the introduction of the two core components of canonical RNAi systems, Argonaute and Dicer, from another budding yeast, Saccharomyces castellii, restores RNAi in S. cerevisiae. We report here that a functional RNAi system can be reconstituted in yeast with the introduction of only S. castellii Dicer and human Argonaute2. Interestingly, whether or not TRBP2 was present, human Dicer was unable to restore RNAi with either S. castellii or human Argonaute. Contrary to previous reports, we find that human Dicer, TRBP2 and Argonaute2 are not sufficient to reconstitute RNAi in yeast when bona fide RNAi precursors are co-expressed. We and others have previously reported that Hsp90 regulates conformational changes in human and Drosophila Argonautes required to accommodate the loading of dsRNA duplexes. Here we show that the activities of both human and S. castellii Argonaute are subject to Hsp90 regulation in S. cerevisiae. In summary, our results suggest that regulation of the RNAi machinery by Hsp90 may have evolved at the same time as ancestral RNAi.

Abstract: Stat3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3) is activated by a number of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. We recently demonstrated that engagement of E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent, cell to cell adhesion molecule which is often required for cells to remain tightly associated within the epithelium, also activates Stat3. We now examined the effect of two other classical cadherins, cadherin-11 and N-cadherin, whose expression often correlates with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition occurring in metastasis of carcinoma cells, upon Stat3 phosphorylation and activity. Our results indicate that engagement of these two cadherins also, can trigger a dramatic surge in Stat3 activity. This activation occurs through upregulation of members of the IL6 family of cytokines, and it is necessary for cell survival, proliferation and migration. Interestingly, our results also demonstrate for the first time that, in sharp contrast to Stat3, the activity of Erk (Extracellular Signal Regulated kinase) was unaffected by cadherin-11 engagement. Further examination indicated that, although IL6 was able to activate Erk in sparsely growing cells, IL6 could not induce an increase in Erk activity levels in densely growing cultures. Most importantly, cadherin-11 knock-down did allow Erk activation by IL6 at high densities, indicating that it is indeed cadherin engagement that prevents Erk activation by IL6. The fact that the three classical cadherins tested so far, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and cadherin11, which are present in essentially all tissues, actually activate Stat3 regardless of their role in metastasis, argues for Stat3 as a central survival, rather than invasion factor.

Abstract: The DEAD box protein family member DDX3 was previously identified as an inhibitor of death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptotic signaling. However, there had been no studies of the role of DDX3 in regulating the other major type of apoptosis, intrinsic apoptotic signaling, which was examined here. Intrinsic apoptosis was induced in MCF-7 cells by treatment with staurosporine, a general kinase inhibitor, thapsigargin, which induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and camptothecin, which causes DNA damage. Each of these treatments caused time-dependent activation of caspase-7, the predominant executioner caspase in these cells. Depletion of DDX3 using shRNA did not alter apoptotic responses to staurosporine or thapsigargin. However, caspase-7 activation induced by camptothecin was regulated by DDX3 in a manner dependent on the functional status of p53. Depletion of DDX3 abrogated camptothecin-induced caspase-7 activation in MCF-7 cells expressing functional wild-type p53, but oppositely potentiated camptothecin-mediated caspase activation in cells expressing mutant or non-functional p53, which was accompanied by increased activation of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling initiator caspase-8. In MCF-7 cells, depletion of DDX3 reduced by more than 50% camptothecin-induced p53 accumulation, and this effect was blocked by inhibition of the proteasome with MG132, indicating that DDX3 regulates p53 not at expression level but rather its stabilization after DNA damage. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that DDX3 associates with p53, and overexpression of DDX3 was sufficient to double the accumulation of p53 in the nucleus after DNA damage. Thus, DDX3 associates with p53, increases p53 accumulation, and positively regulates camptothecin-induced apoptotic signaling in cells expressing functional wild-type p53, whereas in cells expressing mutant or non-functional p53 DDX3 inhibits activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway to reduce caspase activation. These results demonstrate that DDX3 not only regulates extrinsic apoptotic signaling, as previously reported, but also selectively regulates intrinsic apoptotic signaling following DNA damage.

Abstract: 4F2hc is a type-II glycoprotein whose covalent-bound association with one of several described light chains yields a heterodimer mainly involved in large neutral amino acid transport. Likewise, it is well known that the heavy chain interacts with β-integrins mediating integrin-dependent events such as survival, proliferation, migration and even transformation. 4F2hc is a ubiquitous protein whose overexpression has been related to tumor development and progression. Stable silencing of 4F2hc in HeLa cells using an artificial miRNA impairs in vivo tumorigenicity and leads to an ineffective proliferation response to mitogens. 4F2hc colocalizes with β1-integrins and CD147, but this interaction does not occur in lipid rafts in HeLa cells. Moreover, silenced cells present defects in integrin- (FAK, Akt and ERK1/2) and hypoxia-dependent signaling, and reduced expression/activity of MMP-2. These alterations seem to be dependent on the inappropriate formation of CD147/4F2hc/β1-integrin heterocomplexes on the cell surface, arising when CD147 cannot interact with 4F2hc. Although extracellular galectin-3 accumulates due to the decrease in MMP-2 activity, galectin-3 signaling events are blocked due to an impaired interaction with 4F2hc, inducing an increased degradation of β-catenin. Furthermore, cell motility is compromised after protein silencing, suggesting that 4F2hc is related to tumor invasion by facilitating cell motility. Therefore, here we propose a molecular mechanism by which 4F2hc participates in tumor progression, favoring first steps of epithelial–mesenchymal transition by inhibition of β-catenin proteasomal degradation through Akt/GSK-3β signaling and enabling cell motility.

Abstract: Colorectal carcinogenesis relies on loss of homeostasic mechanisms regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. These cell processes have been reported to be influenced independently by transcription factors activated downstream of the Wnt pathway, such as SOX9 and β-catenin, and by the nuclear receptor PPARγ. The purpose of this study was to explore the expression levels and functional link between SOX9, β-catenin and PPARγ in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). We evaluated SOX9, β-catenin and PPARγ expression levels on human CRC specimens by qPCR and immunoblot detection. We tested the hypothesis that PPARγ activation might affect SOX9 and β-catenin expression using four colon cancer cell lines (CaCo2, SW480, HCT116, and HT29 cells). In CRC tissues SOX9 resulted up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels when compared to matched normal mucosa, β-catenin resulted up-regulated at protein levels, while PPARG mRNA and PPARγ protein levels were down-regulated. A significant relationship was observed between high PPARG and SOX9 expression levels in the tumor tissue and female gender (p=0.005 and p=0.04, respectively), and between high SOX9 expression in the tumor tissue and age (p=0.04) and microsatellite instability (MSI), in particular with MSI-H (p=0.0002). Moreover, treatment with the synthetic PPARγ ligand rosiglitazone induced different changes of SOX9 and β-catenin expression and subcellular localization in the colon cancer cell lines examined. In conclusion, SOX9, β-catenin and PPARγ expression levels are deregulated in the CRC tissue, and in colon cancer cell lines ligand-dependent PPARγ activation unevenly influences SOX9 and β-catenin expression and subcellular localization, suggesting a variable mechanistic role in colon carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has recently emerged as an attractive therapeutic target in cancer treatment because of its role in stabilizing the active form of a wide range of client oncoproteins. This study investigated the mechanism of apoptosis induced by the purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71 in different human cancer cell lines and examined the role of Bcl-2 and Bax in this process. We demonstrated that Hsp90 inhibition by PU-H71 generated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) as evidenced by XBP1 mRNA splicing and up-regulation of Grp94, Grp78, ATF4 and CHOP. In response to PU-H71-induced ER stress, apoptosis was triggered in melanoma, cervix, colon, liver and lung cancer cells, but not in normal human fibroblasts. Apoptosis was executed through the mitochondrial pathway as shown by down-regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation and activation of Bax, permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes, release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases. We also found that, in contrast to the ER stressor thapsigargin, PU-H71 induced apoptosis in cells overexpressing Bcl-2 and thus overcame the resistance conferred by this anti-apoptotic protein. In addition, although Bax deficiency rendered cells resistant to PU-H71, combined treatment with the anticancer drugs cisplatin or melphalan greatly sensitized these cells to PU-H71. Taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of Hsp90 by PU-H71 is a promising strategy for cancer treatment, particularly in the case of tumors resistant to conventional chemotherapy.

Abstract: Ribosomal protein S3 (rpS3) is known to play critical roles in ribosome biogenesis and DNA repair. When cellular ROS levels increase, the mitochondrial genes are highly vulnerable to DNA damage. Increased ROS induces rpS3 accumulation in the mitochondria for DNA repair while significantly decreasing the cellular protein synthesis. For the entrance into the mitochondria, the accumulation of rpS3 was regulated by interaction with HSP90, HSP70, and TOM70. Pretreatment with geldanamycin, which binds to the ATP pocket of HSP90, significantly decreased the interaction of rpS3 with HSP90 and stimulated the accumulation of rpS3 in the mitochondria. Furthermore, cellular ROS was decreased and mtDNA damage was rescued when levels of rpS3 were increased in the mitochondria. Therefore, we concluded that when mitochondrial DNA damages accumulate due to increased levels of ROS, rpS3 accumulates in the mitochondria to repair damaged DNA due to the decreased interaction between rpS3 and HSP90 in the cytosol.

Abstract: Herp is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducible protein that participates in the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway. However, the contribution of Herp to other protein degradation pathways like autophagy and its connection to other types of stress responses remain unknown. Here we report that Herp regulates autophagy to clear poly-ubiquitin (poly-Ub) protein aggregates. Proteasome inhibition and glucose starvation (GS) led to a high level of poly-Ub protein aggregation that was drastically reduced by stably knocking down Herp (shHerp cells). The enhanced removal of poly-Ub inclusions protected cells from death caused by glucose starvation. Under basal conditions and increasingly after stress, higher LC3-II levels and GFP-LC3 puncta were observed in shHerp cells compared to control cells. Herp knockout cells displayed basal up-regulation of two essential autophagy regulators—Atg5 and Beclin-1, leading to increased autophagic flux. Beclin-1 up-regulation was due to a reduction in Hrd1 dependent proteasomal degradation, and not at transcriptional level. The consequent higher autophagic flux was necessary for the clearance of aggregates and for cell survival. We conclude that Herp operates as a relevant factor in the defense against glucose starvation by modulating autophagy levels. These data may have important implications due to the known up-regulation of Herp in pathological states such as brain and heart ischemia, both conditions associated to acute nutritional stress.

Abstract: The emerging evidences suggest that endoplasmic (ER) stress is involved in onset of many pathological conditions like cancer and neurodegeneration. The persistent ER stress results in misfolded protein aggregates, which are degraded through the process of autophagy or lead to cell death through activation of caspases. The regulation of crosstalk of autophagy and cell death during ER stress is emerging. Ubiquitination plays regulatory role in crosstalk of autophagy and cell death. In the current study, we describe the role of TRIM13, RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, in regulation of ER stress induced cell death. The expression of TRIM13 sensitizes cells to ER stress induced death. TRIM13 induced autophagy is essential for ER stress induced caspase activation and cell death. TRIM13 induces K63 linked poly-ubiquitination of caspase-8, which results in its stabilization and activation during ER stress. TRIM13 regulates translocation of caspase-8 to autophagosome and its fusion with lysosome during ER stress. This study first time demonstrated the role of TRIM13 as novel regulator of caspase-8 activation and cell death during ER stress.

Abstract: Zinc-binding protein-89 regulates Bak to facilitate apoptosis in cancer cells. This study examined if zinc-binding protein-89 regulates Bak through an epigenetic mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma. We first demonstrated that the expression of Bak was reduced but the levels of deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferase 1 and histone deacetylase 3 were increased in hepatocellular carcinoma cancer tissues compared to the corresponding non-cancer tissues. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between Bak expression and deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferase 1 levels in hepatocellular carcinoma. Administration of zinc-binding protein-89 downregulated histone deacetylase 3 expression and suppressed the activities of histone deacetylase and deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferase, which led to maintenance of histone acetylation status, inhibited the binding of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 to genomic deoxyribonucleic acid and demethylated CpG islands in the Bak promoter in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Using the xenograft mouse tumor model, we demonstrated that zinc-binding protein-89 or inhibitors of either epigenetic enzymes could stimulate Bak expression, induce apoptosis, and arrest tumor growth and that the maximal effort was achieved when zinc-binding protein-89 and the enzyme inhibitors were used in combination. Conclusively, zinc-binding protein-89 upregulates the expression of Bak by targeting multiple components of the epigenetic pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels are expressed in distal renal tubules and play important roles in the transcellular Ca2+ reabsorption in kidney. They are regulated by multiple intracellular factors including protein kinases A and C, membrane phospholipid PIP2, protons, and divalent ions Ca2+ and Mg2+. Here, we report that fluid flow that generates shear force within the physiological range of distal tubular fluid flow activated TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels expressed in HEK cells. Flow-induced activation of channel activity was reversible and did not desensitize over 2min. Fluid flow stimulated TRPV5 and 6-mediated Ca2+ entry and increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration. N-glycosylation-deficient TRPV5 channel was relatively insensitive to fluid flow. In cells coexpressing TRPV5 (or TRPV6) and Slo1-encoded maxi-K channels, fluid flow induced membrane hyperpolarization, which could be prevented by the maxi-K blocker iberiotoxin or TRPV5 and 6 blocker La3+. In contrast, fluid flow did not cause membrane hyperpolarization in cells coexpressing ROMK1 and TRPV5 or 6 channel. These results reveal a new mechanism for the regulation of TRPV5 and TRPV6 channels. Activation of TRPV5 and TRPV6 by fluid flow may play a role in the regulation of flow-stimulated K+ secretion via maxi-K channels in distal renal tubules and in the mechanism of pathogenesis of thiazide-induced hypocalciuria.

Abstract: The twin-arginine translocation (Tat1) pathway is unique with respect to its property to translocate proteins in a fully folded conformation across ion-tight membranes. In chloroplasts and Gram-negative bacteria, Tat translocase consists of the integral subunits TatB and TatC, which are assumed to constitute the membrane receptor, and TatA, a bitopic membrane protein being responsible in a yet unknown manner for the membrane translocation step. Antibody inhibition of intrinsic thylakoidal TatA activity and recovery of transport by heterologously expressed, purified TatA allowed to exactly quantify the amount of TatA required to catalyse membrane transport of the model Tat substrate 16/23. We can show that TatA concentrations in the 100nM range are sufficient to efficiently catalyse membrane transport of the protein, which corresponds well to the amount of TatA identified in thylakoids. Furthermore, TatA shows cooperativity in its catalytic activity suggesting that Tat translocase operates as an allosteric enzyme complex.

Abstract: UDP-Glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) is a central component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) glycoprotein-folding quality control system, which prevents the exit of partially folded species. UGGT activity can be regulated by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, a stimulus that triggers a complex signaling pathway known as unfolded protein response (UPR) which is closely associated with inflammation and disease. In this work, we investigated the effect of progesterone (P4) on the expression and activity of UGGT in a mouse hybridoma. We detected the expression of two UGGT isoforms, UGGT1 and UGGT2, and demonstrated that both isoforms are active in these cells. Interestingly, the expression of each isoform is regulated by high physiological P4 concentrations. This work provides the first evidence of a hormonal regulation of UGGT isoform expression and activity, which might influence the glycoprotein quality control mechanism. These findings could contribute to the study of pathologies triggered by the accumulation of misfolded proteins.

Abstract: It is now recognized that in addition to its activity upon erythroid progenitor cells, erythropoietin (Epo) is capable of stimulating survival of different non-erythroid cells. Since stimulation of erythropoiesis is unwanted for neuroprotection, Epo-like compounds with a more selective action are under investigation. Although the carbamylated derivative of erythropoietin (cEpo) has demonstrated non-hematopoietic tissue protection without erythropoietic effect, little is known about differential mechanisms between Epo and cEpo. Therefore, we investigated signaling pathways which play a key role in Epo-induced proliferation. Here we show that cEpo blocked FOXO3a phosphorylation, allowing expression of downstream target p27kip1 in UT-7 and TF-1 cells capable of erythroid differentiation. This is consistent with the involvement of cEpo in slowing down G1-to-S-phase progression compared with the effect of Epo upon cell cycle. In contrast, similar antiapoptotic actions of cEpo and Epo were observed in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. Inhibition and competition assays suggest that Epo may act through both, the homodimeric (EpoR/EpoR) and the heterodimeric (EpoR/βcR) receptors in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells and probably in the TF-1 cell type as well. Results also indicate that cEpo needs both the EpoR and βcR subunits to prevent apoptosis of neuronal cells. Based on evidence suggesting that cell proliferation pathways were involved in the differential effect of Epo and cEpo, we went forward to studying downstream signals. Here we provide the first evidence that unlike Epo, cEpo failed to induce FOXO3a inactivation and subsequent p27kip1 downregulation, which is clearly shown in the incapacity of cEpo to induce erythroid cell growth.

Abstract: Cyclosporine A and FK506 produce immunosuppression by blocking calcineurin phosphatase activity and consequently activation of cytosolic Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cell (NFATc) transcription factor. Due to the chronic toxicity associated with their administration, the development of more specific immunosuppressants is currently an important unmet medical need. In this context, an immunosuppressant peptide derived from the CIC motif of the human Regulators of Calcineurin (RCAN) proteins has been shown to inhibit NFATc signaling without affecting general phosphatase activity of calcineurin. Here we show that protein kinase CK2 phosphorylates a conserved serine residue within the CIC motif of vertebrate RCANs, which increases its affinity for calcineurin and consequently its inhibition of NFATc-dependent gene expression in activated T-cells. Molecular modeling studies have led us to identify a positively charged interaction site on the surface of calcineurin where the phosphorylated serine residue of the CIC motif would normally locate. Finally, we have also identified RCAN3 as a new phosphoprotein with multiple phosphorylation sites. Therefore, our findings reveal for the first time a novel molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of calcineurin–NFATc signaling by means of phosphorylation of the CIC motif of RCAN proteins. The knowledge of how RCAN proteins modulate the calcineurin–NFATc pathway paves the way for the development of potent novel selective immunosuppressant drugs.
