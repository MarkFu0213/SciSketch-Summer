Abstract: The measured properties of constituent materials of experimentally prepared ZrO2/V1-zWzO2/ZrO2 thermochromic coatings with a low transition temperature are used to optimize the coating performance by varying the thicknesses of individual layers. The main attention is paid to the optimization of coating color in transmission, with the aim to shift its chromaticity from yellow to white. The results show that almost white chromaticity can be achieved and preserved in a wide range of beam angles without any concessions in terms of the solar energy transmittance, and that there is a tradeoff between the chromaticity and the luminous transmittance. The dependence of optimum ZrO2 thicknesses and of the resulting coating performance on the V1-zWzO2 thickness is discussed as well. The results are important for the design and appearance of energy-saving smart windows.

Abstract: In this work, we present an approach to model metallization-induced recombination losses j0,met of screen-printed fire-through metallization pastes, which are used e.g. for the contacts on the front side of passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC). Modelling is based on the local phosphorus emitter doping profile and the local microstructure of the interface between metal contact and silicon surface, which is characterized during a quantitative microstructural analysis using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). By comparing the modelled j0,met to measured j0,met results determined at the same position of both, the microstructural analysis and emitter doping profile, we find that in most cases recombination is dominated by the etch back of the emitter by the glass frit rather than by penetration of crystallites into the doped region. However, for crystallites protruding deep into the emitter or rather up to the junction, recombination at the crystallites becomes significant as well. Our modelled results yield indications that the etch depth into the emitter doping profile by the glass frit contained in the metallization paste, is sensitive to the emitter doping profile itself.

Abstract: We review the famous Cox & Strack equation that is commonly applied in contact resistance measurements of samples with a negligible contact resistance at the sample backside. We apply geometric interpretations to extend the Cox & Strack model a) to samples that have a non-negligible contact resistance not only on the front- but also on the back-side and b) to junctions with a buried contact resistance underneath a conductive layer. Case a) is for example a symmetric sample with a single material junction on both sample surfaces. Case b) could be a poly-Si/SiOx/c-Si or a-Si/c-Si hetero-junction. We compare our analytic treatment with rigorous finite-element simulations and find a relative agreement between 2.5 % and 36 % depending on the sample geometry and resistance values. We apply the method to analyze the contact resistance of lifetime samples with both-sided n+/n-type poly-Si junctions.

Abstract: Solar still using phase change materials (PCM) can enhance desalination. Due to the long-term running of the desalination plants, therefore the annual performance of solar still using shape-stabilized PCM (SSPCM) was studied with economic analysis in this paper. Firstly, a comprehensive model coupling with still energy balance and annual solar radiation was built to assess the annual performance of the solar still, the internal heat conduction was considered particularly for modelling of heat transfer in SSPCM. Then an experimental solar still using SSPCM was performed to testify the built model by still temperature and production. Moreover, three solar stills were concerned to simulate the annual performance, including: conventional solar still (without PCM), solar still with SSPCM, solar still with SSPCM and solar collector. The results showed that the annual production of the solar still with SSPCM, solar still with SSPCM and solar collector were 750 L/m2 and 1000 L/m2, 28.4%, 71.2% higher than that of conventional solar still respectively. And the annual efficiency for the three solar stills were 28%, 39%, 55%. The solar still with SSPCM got the lowest TAC with about 0.123 ¥/L at the first year whose payback period of the solar still with SSPCM was the shortest which was about 7 years with water price of 0.2 ¥/L.

Abstract: Qualification standards are on the base of the high endurance and resilience of space solar cells. In these standards, such as the European ECSS-E-ST-20-08C or the American AIAA S-111A counterpart, life tests related with high temperature accelerated tests (among many others) are included. There are several issues that make it difficult to assess the multijunction solar cell life from temperature tests in these standards. For example, in the European standard, an activation energy of 0.7 eV determined many years ago for silicon devices is assumed. On the other hand, the American standard proposes temperature accelerated tests at the temperatures of 50 °C, 80 °C and 110 °C which are clearly low to really accelerate the life tests of solar cells. Accordingly, in this paper we present the resulting reliability figures (reliability function, failure probability and MTTF) derived of an innovative temperature ALT which allows the proper estimation of the activation energy of commercial lattice matched GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge triple junction solar cells. The main conclusions are: a) an activation energy of 0.97 eV has been estimated. This value results in significantly higher lifetime values for the tested cells. b) the shape parameter obtained from Weibull failure density function, β, is 1.67; c) the tested solar cells perform as robust devices showing high reliability values in the temperature range of 80 °C–130 °C; d) for higher temperatures, especially beyond 150 °C, the reliability decays significantly; f) reliability functions and parameters can be assessed for any operation temperature and failure criterion.

Abstract: Micro/nanotextured topographies (MNTs) can modulate cell-biomaterial interactions mostly by their controllable geometrics. Among them, TiO2 nanotubes, regarded as having a highly controllable nanoscale geometry, have been extensively investigated and applied and significantly affect diameter-dependent cell biological behaviors. In this study, we used five typical MNTs decorated with TiO2 nanotubes with diameters of 30, 50, 70, 100 and 120 nm to explore the optimal nanotube diameter for improving the biofunctional properties and to more deeply understand the underlying mechanisms by which these MNTs affect osteogenic differentiation by revealing the effect of beta1-integrin/Hedgehog-Gli1 signaling on this process. The MNTs affected MG63 osteoblast-like cell spreading, osteogenic gene expression (BMP-2, Runx2 and ALP), mineralization and ALP activity in a diameter-dependent pattern, and the optimal TiO2 nanotube diameter of 70 nm provided the best microenvironment for osteogenic differentiation as well as beta1-integrin/Hedgehog-Gli1 signaling activation. This enhanced osteogenic differentiation by the optimal-diameter TiO2 nanotubes of 70 nm was attenuated via suppression of the beta1-integrin/ Hedgehog-Gli1 signaling, which indicated a significant role of this pathway in mediating the diameter-dependent osteogenic differentiation promotional effect of MNTs with different TiO2 nanotube diameters. These results might provide deeper insights into the signal transduction mechanisms by which different nanoscale geometries influence cellular functions for biomaterial modification and biofunctionalization.

Abstract: Heat storage technologies are subject of great research efforts aimed at improving the energy efficiency of power plants and heat recovery processes. In this context, the development of highly efficient and low-cost materials for thermal energy storage is imperative for a large use of this technology. The storage of thermal energy using reversible thermo-chemical reactions can provide large storage capacities especially at high temperatures. Within this class of materials, the red-ox reactions have particular interest due to the low cost of the materials involved (metal oxides) and the use of air both as reacting gas and heat transfer fluid. Therefore, many efforts are doing to improve the efficiency and reversibility of this type of reactions. In this work the synthesis and thermal performances of a novel mixed metal oxide based on cobalt/nickel metals with spinel structure Co3-xNixO4 is reported. A deep study was carried out in order to find the best synthesis conditions and optimum relative metal content in the structure with the objective of decreasing as much as possible the red-ox temperature. The study allowed to determine the optimum Ni content in the oxide structure in order to minimize the reaction temperature. In particular, a linear relationship of the red-ox temperature as a function of the Ni content was observed, enabling reaching red-ox temperature below 700 °C. These results are very promising and open the perspective of using of these types of materials to a wider field of application.

Abstract: Following the emergence of electronic cigarette, or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI) in 2019 in the US, regulation of e-cigarettes has become globally tighter and the collective evidence of the detrimental effects of vaping has grown. The danger of cellular distress and altered homeostasis is heavily associated with the modifiable nature of electronic cigarette devices. An array of harmful chemicals and elevated concentrations of metals have been detected in e-cigarette aerosols which have been linked to various pathogeneses. Vaping is linked to increased inflammation, altered lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction whilst also increasing microbial susceptibility whilst the long-term damage is yet to be observed. The scientific evidence is mounting and highlighting that, along with traditional tobacco cigarette smoking, electronic cigarette vaping is not a safe practice.

Abstract: In the last few years, perovskite-based solar cells have seen rapid improvements of their power conversion efficiencies (PCE) that have already reached silicon cell values. The commercial use of perovskite cell technology remains, however, a challenge due to durability issues. In fact, perovskite films when exposed to moisture and oxygen undergo degradation within a couple of hours or days. In order to address these problems, several strategies have been developed in recent years, including surface passivation and coating. Herein, we analyze and compare two perovskite stability improvement approaches, each aimed at the reduction of the oxygen diffusion, one by adding chlorine to perovskite precursors in order to block iodine vacancy sites, and the other by coating the perovskite layers with protective Al2O3 films using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). The study provides an experimental verification of the degradation mechanism linking it to oxygen diffusion into the perovskite films. As shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the addition of chlorine into the iodine-based perovskite film slows down the oxygen diffusion, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements show improved stability of such iodide perovskite with chlorine addition. Characteristic times for oxygen diffusion into subsurface region as well as for degradation process of film volume are provided and discussed. XRD measurements are also used to show that an additional significant stability improvement can also be achieved when the films are coated with a protective ALD Al2O3 layer.

Abstract: Solar steam generation as a green and sustainable technology has recently attracted significant interest for relieving the longstanding challenge of clean water resources. However, the large-scale preparation of low cost photothermal materials for solar steam generators is highly desired yet still challenging. Herein, semi-coke (SC), a solid byproduct of coal industrial, was first demonstrated as an efficient photothermal material and successfully applied in solar steam generation system by depositing SC on melamine sponge with the assistance of polydopamine. Then, the modified melamine sponge was functionalized by hydrophobic methyl trichlorosilane to fabricate the self-floating semi-coke/polydopamine@photothermal melamine sponge (SPMS). Based on their outstanding light absorption, good wettability, and effective thermal location, the SPMS performs a high evaporation rate of 1.41 kg m−2 h−1 with a solar thermal conversion efficiency of 90.56% under 1 sun irradiation. Meanwhile, the SPMS has remarkable cycle stability and water purification abilities for seawater, dyeing wastewater and heavy metal solution. By turning “waste” to “wealth”, the SPMS shows great potential for sustainable applications in synergetic solar clean water production.

Abstract: Photovoltaic modules were manufactured by vacuum resin infusion process using glass reinforced epoxy composite as encapsulant where the cells are embedded. Incorporation of ultraviolet absorber (UVA) and hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) additives to the epoxy resin was studied, given their potential to enhance the performance stability of the modules under ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure. Photovoltaic and aging performance were examined through the evolution of external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, short-circuit current values and colour change. Decrease in the initial photovoltaic performance of the modules was observed, as evidenced in the short-circuit losses when additives are incorporated. Regarding the performance stability, increasing the content of both, UVA and HALS, leaded to improved results with lower short-circuit current loss and yellowness observed due to UV radiation. The most stable module, with cells embedded in 1% UVA and 1% HALS containing composite, showed a 2.8% short-circuit current loss after an UV exposure of 15.4 KWh/m2. UV protection enhancement was obtained in trade-off with initial photovoltaic performance, which should be considered when defining the additives and the amount to be used.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is associated with increased levels of extracellular heme, which is a key mediator of inflammation in this condition. Despite abundant evidence supporting this concept in cell and animal models, few studies addressed the association between heme levels and the development and severity of acute vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) in humans.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in patients with acute VOC. Total extracellular heme levels were measured in both plasma and serum at admission and after convalescence, and correlated with other clinical and laboratory markers of SCA severity.
Results
A total of 28 episodes of VOC in 25 patients were included. Heme levels were similar between admission and convalescence, and correlated with the difference between pre and post hemoglobin, and SCA severity estimated by a composite score of clinical and laboratory markers. Heme levels were neither associated with VOC severity nor with markers of hemostasis activation, and were similar to those reported in an independent population of SCA patients at steady state.
Discussion
Acute VOC are not characterized by significant increases in total extracellular heme levels. Studies measuring the fraction of free extracellular heme unbound to proteins are warranted to further refine our understanding of the role of heme in acute VOC.

Abstract: In recent years, the efficiency of organic solar cells has been rapidly increasing, with lab-scale devices having crossed the point of 17% efficiency. However, large-area devices are still a step behind, only just recently crossing the 12% limit. One of the reasons for this observed lag is the finite conductivity of the transparent electrode used that introduces power loss. However, this problem can be solved by adding a metal grid to the transparent electrode to increase its conductivity. In this work, we studied, both theoretically and experimentally, the effect of a metal grid on the performance of organic solar cells. Specifically, we investigated cell performance as a function of the positioning and number of grid lines. Our results show that there is a characteristic cell length that depends on the cell's optoelectronic properties and the transparent electrode conductivity, and it enables prediction of an optimized number of grid lines for a given cell size. Moreover, it can be used to calculate the preferred position of the grid lines. Our findings of both the number and positioning of the grid lines can boost large-area cell efficiency even further and reduce the gap between large-area and lab-scale devices.

Abstract: Background
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of immature lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. The BMI-1 is an important component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex-1 (PRC1). It is an important molecule for the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The BMI-1 expression is generally high in HSCs and decreases after cell differentiation. The BMI-1 is required for the maintenance of normal and cancer stem cells and has been reported as an oncogene in various tumors. The NANOG is a homeodomain transcription factor responsible for maintaining the stem cell compartment at the blastocyst stage of developing embryos. The NANOG gene has been proven to be transcribed in CD34+ cells and different leukemic cells.
Methods
The ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) of 30 pediatric ALL patients (16 B-ALL and 14 T-ALL) and 14 healthy controls. The Bmi-1 and NANOG expression levels were determined using the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
Results
Compared to normal controls, patients with ALL exhibited upregulated levels of Bmi-1 (p=0.03). Patients who overexpressed Bmi-1 and NANOG displayed a significantly worse survival than low-expressing patients (hazard ratio (HR) 5.74, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.48–22, p=0.012 and HR 3.8, 95% CI:1.009–14.3, p=0.048, respectively).
Conclusions
Taken together, these data suggest that the Bmi-1 and NANOG might serve as a novel survival predictor in ALL patients. Our observation also suggests that the Bmi-1 and NANOG could serve as new therapeutic targets for treatment of pediatric ALL.

Abstract: We report on the understanding and optimization of ion-implanted boron emitters in combination with screen-printed contacts to produce very low recombination current density and high-efficiency cells with rear poly-Si/SiO2 passivated contact. Due to high bulk lifetime in n-base Si and very low recombination in the rear-side n+ passivated contact, recombination in the emitter limits the efficiency potential of manufacturable single-side passivated contact cells. Emitter recombination is governed by recombination under metal contacts (J0e,metal) and in the passivated regions in between (J0e,pass). Emitter profile engineering and dielectric passivation can lower the J0e,pass while paste chemistry and firing conditions can reduce J0e,metal by altering the extent of screen-printing induced emitter surface etching and the percentage of unetched dielectric islands under the metal contacts. We optimized implanted boron profiles, surface concentration and passivation, and junction depth in the sheet resistance range of 48-200 Ω/□ and achieved very low J0e,pass (<15 fA/cm2) for textured boron emitters with Rsheet≥140 Ω/□. Additionally, screen-printing paste and firing optimization reduced J0e,metal from 1172 to 707 fA/cm2 on 170 Ω/□ boron emitter by virtually eliminating emitter surface etching and creating distributed local contacts with unetched dielectric islands (~40% area coverage) underneath the grid lines. This resulted in very low total metallized J0e of 30 fA/cm2 with 3% metal coverage. Our device modeling showed the optimum boron sheet resistance is in the range of 120-170 Ω/□. The simulated results were validated by fabricating fully screen-printed 100 cm2 22.9% efficient bifacial cell with n+ poly-Si/SiO2 passivated rear contact.

Abstract: Introduction
von Willebrand’s disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. The 1-desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) is the treatment of choice for most responsive patients with VWD. The aim of this study was to evaluate DDAVP use in the management of VWD.
Method
We implemented a survey targeting medical doctors involved in the management of VWD in Brazil. Data was collected during a national congress on Hematology in November 2017.
Main results
A total of 51/80 (63.8%) questionnaires were collected. Most participants (76.2%) were hematologists who assisted adult patients and approximately 60% worked at hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). Approximately half of participants who reported treating patients with VWD, assisted on average, less than 5 patients per month, and approximately 60% declared not having used any DDAVP for treating VWD in the previous year. However, most participants (70%) prescribed FVIII-containing VWF concentrate (VWF/FVIII) for 1–10 patients in the previous year. More than 80% of the participants recognized the main indications for DDAVP. Physicians who recognized indication for DDAVP for type 1 VWD more often had prescribed DDAVP in previous year (p =  0.03). Barriers for prescribing DDAVP varied and included unavailability of laboratory facilities and consumables for DDAVP testing and lack of skills on its prescription.
Conclusion
The DDAVP is currently underused in Brazil, as opposed to the excessive use of VWF/FVIII in VWD patients. We suggest the adoption of measures targeting educational and auditing programs. Furthermore, availability of laboratory reagents is needed to evaluate response and increment the correct use of DDAVP.

Abstract: Objective/background
Data generated from retrospective studies on primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) outcome are valuable as no prospective phase 3 trials have been conducted in this rare type of lymphoma.
Methods
Our goal was to assess the long-term outcome of 41 patients with PMBCL who were treated at the Kuwait Cancer Center. We evaluated two types of multidrug treatment, R-CHOP (rituximab, vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone) and DA-EPOCH-R (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and rituximab), and determined overall survival and complete response (CR) as primary endpoints.
Results
In our cohort, 27 (66%) cases were treated with R-CHOP and 14 (34%) cases were treated with DA-EPOCH-R. The overall median follow-up time was 34 months. Among the patients treated with R-CHOP, 23 out of 27 (92.6%) patients achieved CR; similarly, 10 out of 14 patients (85.7%) in the DA-EPOCH-R group achieved CR after initial treatment. There were no differences in OS between patients treated with R-CHOP versus DA-EPOCH-R.
Conclusion
The findings of this study indicate that combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy results in excellent long-term outcome of patients with PMBCL. At our center, we prefer R-CHOP to DA-EPOCH-R for low-risk patients with nonbulky disease.

Abstract: Nanocomposites of dielectric/metal/dielectric (DMD) materials that are both optically transparent and electrically conductive are of great interest for an array of modern optoelectronic applications, including electrochromic and energy storage devices. Here we report for the first time the creation of ITO-free DMD nanocomposite structures that are composed of only three layers: (Ag-doped WO3)/(Ag)/(WO3). We employed high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) as a new technology to deposit the internal WO3 layer and the external Ag/WO3 nanocomposite. High rates of silver ionization in the HiPIMS process and energetic arrival of silver ions on the negatively biased DMD structure enabled their penetration into the external tungsten oxide layer, forming a nanocomposite structure in a single-step process. We provided evidence that this unique structure pushes the performance of transparent-conductive DMD materials beyond their intrinsic limits. To optimize the surface plasmon resonance effect and thus the electrochromic performance of the structures, we changed the size of silver nanoclusters through vacuum post-annealing in the same sputtering chamber at varied temperatures. The optimized Ag-WO3/Ag/WO3 structure was transparent (average transmittance = 75.89 ± 0.05% in the wavelength range of 300–700 nm) and electrically conductive (sheet resistance = 23.6 ± 0.8 Ω/□). Moreover, it showed favorable electrochromic characteristics with high coloration efficiency (32.1 cm2 C−1), fast switching speed, and excellent long-term stability for at least 2000 cycles. The mechanisms of improvement in the electrochromic performance of such bifunctional structures underpinned by surface plasmon resonance, as modulated by the size and average distance of silver nanoclusters, are elucidated. The versatile new approach using HiPIMS for the fabrication of transparent-conductive nanocomposite coatings on ITO-free substrates holds great potential to manufacture next-generation optoelectronic materials such as electrochromic devices.

Abstract: Well-aligned ZnO nanorods with tunable length are successfully deposited using a low-temperature chemical bath deposition method, and subsequently used in constructing solar cells with the structure of FTO/ZnO nanorods/MAPbI3-xClx/P3HT/Au. The charge transport is balanced by tuning the length of nanorods and improving the morphology of the perovskite layer. Uniformity and charge transport within the film is improved by doping the perovskite structure with Cl− ions. The photovoltaic characteristics of the cells are improved as the length of nanorods increases from 300 nm to 460 nm, and deteriorate as it increases further. Using nanorods with the length of 460 nm, power conversion efficiency of 12.85% and Jsc over 22 mA/cm2 are obtained. This efficiency is in the range of the best efficiencies reported so far using P3HT as the hole transporting layer (HTL) and ZnO as the electron transporting layer (ETL). For the first time, PSCs based on ZnO nanorods are fabricated, in which copper iodide is deposited as the inorganic HTL through vapor iodination of Cu film. A promising efficiency of 8.09% is achived which is in the range of the highest efficiencies reported for n-i-p PSCs with CuI as the HTL.

Abstract: The dynamics of correlated ionic-electronic components often get reflected in the measured photovoltage of a hybrid perovskite solar cell. This communication describes a unique overshoot voltage phenomenon that appears soon the light is turned off during the large signal photovoltage transient measurements at low (≤250K) temperature regime. The occurrence of the overshoot voltage largely depends on fluence, temperature and can be perturbed with device preconditioning. We observe that the phenomenon occurs only in TiO2 based devices but never if the electron transport layer is SnO2 indicating that the interface plays a major role. Our investigations reveal a strong correlation between the ionic movement and the transitory photogenerated electric field that are responsible for the momentary increase in the measured potential.

Abstract: It has been reported that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) acts as a tumor promoter in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our previous studies showed that Cav-1 promoted mouse hepatocarcinoma cell adhesion to fibronectin by upregulating β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase I (ST6Gal-I) expression. However, the detailed mechanism by which Cav-1 regulates ST6Gal-I is not fully understood. In this study, we found that the expression levels of Cav-1 and ST6Gal-I were increased in HCC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis. Cav-1 upregulated ST6Gal-I expression to promote the migration and invasion of HCC cells by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Importantly, the binding of the transcription factor nuclear receptor 4A2/retinoid X receptor alpha (NR4A2/RXRα) to the -550/-200 region of the ST6GAL1 promoter was critical for Cav-1-induced ST6GAL1 gene expression. Furthermore, Cav-1 expression activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) signaling pathway, followed by upregulation of NR4A2 expression and phosphorylation of RXRα, which facilitated the complex of NR4A2 and phosphorylated RXRα forming and binding to the ST6GAL1 promoter region to induce its transcription. Finally, in the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC murine model, the expression levels of NR4A2, p-RXRα, ST6Gal-I, and α2,6-linked sialic acid decreased in parallel in Cav-1−/− mice compared with Cav-1+/+ mice, which was consistent with the above in vitro results. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of ST6GAL1 gene transcription mediated by Cav-1, which may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting metastasis in HCC.

Abstract: In this work, we fabricate, characterize and present a stability study of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC70BM inverted organic solar cells (iOSCs) with two different solution-processed electron transport layers (ETLs), PFN and ZnO, under indoor light and AM 1.5 G illumination spectrum. A warm white color light-emitting diode was used as the indoor light source. Under the luminance of 1000 lux, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.85% and maximum power density (MPP) of 45.1 μW/cm2 were obtained for cells with PFN as ETL. After 1536 h of constant indoor light illumination, the PCE remained above 70% of the original value. The best stability of encapsulated devices, under AM 1.5 illumination spectrum was also observed for these cells, which still maintained a PCE above 60% after 6000 h.

Abstract: Antimony chalcogenides, Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3, are the promising candidates for next generation solar cells due to its non-toxicity, earth abundance, low cost and easy availability. In this work, Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 hetero-junction solar cells are modeled, numerically analyzed and compared by the SCAPS (Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator) software. Initial simulation for configuration optimization was done in detail for absorber layer thickness, buffer layer thickness, acceptor density, radiative recombination coefficient, series-shunt resistance, defect density and the work function of the back contact. A detailed analysis of the junction characteristics like carrier generation and recombination, built-in electric field and capacitance-voltage (C-V) study was also done in the second stage to determine the carrier lifetime, depletion width, built-in potential and doping density. The present study shows that, the optimum thickness for Sb2S3 absorber layer is 2.5 μm and for Sb2Se3 absorber layer is 2 μm to achieve the best efficiency. The buffer layer optimum thickness for Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 solar cell is in the range of 50 nm to 60 nm. The optimum series and shunt resistance for Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 based solar cell device is coming in the range of 3–5 Ω-cm2 and 300 - 450 Ω-cm2 respectively. It is also found that metal having work function 5eV or more is better to be used as an electrode in Sb2S3 or Sb2Se3 based solar cell. A maximum efficiency of 9.51% and 12.62% is achieved after optimizing different parameters for the Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3 solar cells respectively.

Abstract: Antiapoptotic and proapoptotic BCL-2 protein family members regulate mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Small molecule inhibitors of antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins including BCL-2-specific inhibitor ABT-199 (Venetoclax) are in clinical development. However, the efficiency of ABT-199 as a single agent in solid tumors is limited. We performed a high-throughput RNAi kinome screen targeting 691 kinases to identify potentially targetable kinases to enhance ABT-199 response in breast cancer cells. Our studies identified Wee1 as the primary target kinase to overcome resistance to ABT-199. Depletion of Wee1 by siRNA-mediated knockdown or inhibition of Wee1 by the small molecule Wee1 inhibitor AZD1775 sensitized SKBR3, MDA-MB-468, T47D and CAMA-1 breast cancer cells to ABT-199 along with decreased MCL1. BH3-only proteins PUMA and BIM functionally contribute to apoptosis signaling following co-targeting BCL-2 and Wee1. Suppression of Wee1 function increased mitochondrial cell death priming. Furthermore, we found that Wee1 inhibition altered MCL1 phosphorylation and protein stability, which led to HUWE1-mediated MCL1 degradation. Our findings suggest that Wee1 inhibition can overcome resistance to ABT-199 and provide a rationale for further translational investigation of BCL-2 inhibitor/Wee1 inhibitor combination in breast cancer.

Abstract: Vanadium dioxide displays thermochromic properties based on its structural phase transition from monoclinic VO2 (M) to rutile VO2 (R) and vice versa, and the accompanying reversible metal-insulator transition. We developed a single layer coating comprising VO2 (M) and SiO2. We applied the coating from an alcoholic solution comprising vanadium(IV) oxalate complex and pre-oligomerized tetra ethoxy silane to SiO2-coated float glass using dip coating, and thermally annealed the dried xerocoat in a two-step process. The addition of SiO2 as coating matrix resulted in non-scattering coatings with low surface roughness and random distribution of VO2 nanodomains (≤200 nm). Furthermore, the formation of the coating, comprising a phase separation yielding SiO2 and VO2 nanodomains during the thermal anneal, was studied in detail. The coating displays unrivalled optical properties, combining high visible light transmission Tvis > 60% and large solar modulation ΔTsol ≥ 10%. When applied in insulating glass units, the coating has a positive impact on energy savings for heating and cooling of buildings in intermediate climates, which we demonstrated through building energy simulations. For a typical house in the Netherlands, energy savings up to 24% were obtained. In addition, we demonstrate a coating stability comparable to current energy-efficient window coatings during processing into and in insulating glass units through (accelerated) life time tests.

Abstract: In this study, highly efficient and flexible Na-doped kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin-film solar cells with an efficiency of over 8% were developed. A CZTSSe thin film was deposited on a flexible Mo foil using metal precursors with varying thickness of the NaF layers on the CZTSSe thin film. The sample maintained 92.2% of its performance after 1000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 12 mm. To investigate defect passivation effect of Na doping through the electrical properties of Na-passivated grain boundaries (GBs), the cells were examined by scanning probe microscopy. Downward band bending was observed at GBs in the Na-sufficient CZTSSe absorber layers; that is, Na enhanced the potential barrier at the CZTSSe GBs in the solar cells and the separation of carriers. The carrier separation increased under illuminated condition. Moreover, the surface photovoltage (SPV) of the cells was measured at laser wavelengths of 405, 532, and 640 nm using photo-assisted Kelvin probe force microscopy to investigate the photogenerated carrier transport in Na-passivated CZTSSe solar cells. The Na content strongly affected the photo-induced changes in the carrier behavior. A cell with a sufficiently Na-doped CZTSSe absorber layer exhibited a large SPV with a maximum value of 46 meV under illumination, whereas Na-deficient samples showed a lower SPV, indicating that Na passivates defects that act as recombination sites. A photo-induced defect passivation effect was observed in a cell with optimal Na content under 405 nm wavelength illuminated condition, which resulted in charge accumulation at the absorber surface.

Abstract: Current-voltage (J-V) measurements under illumination are essential for studying solar cells. They directly provide fundamental parameters of the solar cell, as the short-circuit current (JSC), the open-circuit voltage (VOC), and the fill-factor (FF); but a deeper investigation of transport phenomena along the fourth quadrant is hampered by the tight linear scale, limited between zero to ~1 V. In this work, we present transient measurements carried out in an organic solar cell (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/Ca/Al), which allows to analyze J-V curves, by extending the scale from a linear to a logarithmic scale. For this, we used a circuit similar to that used in transient measurements, by replacing the voltage source by a variable load resistance RL (from 50 Ω to 1 MΩ). A voltage transient ΔV(t) and its time decay τ are measured over each RL, and τ-RL curves were obtained, keeping the device under different intensities of sunlight. Each τ-RL curve is divided in three distinct zones: one in which the extraction dominates the photocurrent; the second where a competition between extraction and non-geminate recombination is established; and the third, dominated by recombination and diffusion. An equivalent circuit is used to analyze the τ-RL curves, in which the diode resistance plays a relevant role, especially in the region close to VOC. Not only recombination mechanisms can be better analyzed through this new approach, but also the distinction between drift and diffusion transports.

Abstract: Introduction
To assess the frequency of allergic reactions to asparaginase (ASP) and possible risk factors for reactions in a cohort of pediatric patients.
Method
The study was performed based on retrospective data from patients under acute lymphoid leukemia treatment in a general university hospital located in southern Brazil. Information on patients who used ASP from 2010 to 2017 was collected. Allergic reactions were identified in electronic medical records.
Results
Among the 98 patients included in the study, 16 (16.3 %) experienced an allergic reaction to native l-asparaginase (L-ASP). Of the 22 patients (22.4 %) that received only intravenous (IV) administration of l-ASP, 10 (62.5 %) had allergic reactions, while 48 patients (49 %) received intramuscular (IM) administration and 28 (28.6 %) received IV and IM administrations. The occurrence of allergic reactions differed between the groups (p <  0.001), and IV administration was associated with allergic reactions. Association was also observed between the severity of the reaction and the route of administration, with the IM route associated with grade 2 and IV route associated with grade 3. Occurrence of allergic reactions was higher when the commercial formulation of l-ASP, Leuginase®, was used (p =  0.0009 in the analysis per patient and p =  0.0003 in the analysis per administration).
Conclusions
The IV administration and commercial Leuginase® presentation were associated with more allergic reactions in the study population, which corroborates the findings in the literature. The IV route was also associated with higher severity of reactions in the present study.

Abstract: Objective/Background
To analyse the influence of chromosomal aberrations in addition to t(15;17)(q22;q21) in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) on clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes.
Methods
Fifty-seven patients with new APL diagnoses underwent conventional cytogenetic analysis; fluorescence in situ hybridization for t(15;17)(q22;q21) and reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction detected PML/RARα in two forms: L (length) and S (short) and accepted treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy. Patients with additional chromosome aberrations were designated as the complex karyotype group and were compared with patients with only t(15;17), who were designated as the simple karyotype group.
Results
Additional chromosome aberrations was observed in 18/57 patients (31.6%) at initial diagnosis. Outcome was significantly different between the simple karyotype group and the complex karyotype group for complete remission (92.3% vs. 66.7% respectively, p = .025), overall survival at 3 years (92.3% vs. 65.0%, respectively, p = .017), and progression-free survival at 3 years (81.4% vs. 44.4%, respectively, p = .024).
Conclusions
Additional chromosome aberrations had adverse effects on the prognosis in APL.

Abstract: In this article, the results of investigation of processes occurring during the molecular-beam deposition of germanium layers on Si3N4 dielectric substrates within a wide range of the Ge film growth temperatures (30–600 °C) are presented. The intensity of the IR absorption bands related to the vibrations of the N–H and Si–N bonds are established to decrease with the increase of the Ge deposition temperature. This phenomenon apparently cannot be explained as only a thermally activated process. Simultaneously, the peaks corresponding to the Ge–N and Ge–O vibration bonds emerge in the X-ray photoelectron spectra. We believe that the deposition of Ge films on Si3N4 dielectric substrates containing hydrogen atoms resulted in the migration of hydrogen atoms from the dielectric layer into the growing film. We interpret the experimental results in terms of a model, according to which the diffusion of hydrogen atoms from the Si3N4 layer into the growing Ge film occurs due to the difference in chemical potentials of hydrogen atoms in the dielectric layer and the germanium film. This process initiates the diffusion of germanium atoms in the opposite direction, into the Si3N4 layer, where they connect to dangling bonds of nitrogen atoms arising due to the escape of hydrogen atoms. The analogous processes occur during the deposition of silicon layers on Si3N4 substrates.

Abstract: Although solar cells operate under illumination, most electrical characterization methods are carried out in darkness, which implies some bias. In this work, we study the influence of light on the contact resistivity of the electron and hole contacts of a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cell using the transfer length method (TLM) method in order to determine them in conditions representative of an operating solar cell at maximum power point. A specific fabrication process has been developed to preserve the passivation level. Therefore, we first focus on the patterning approach used for processing, and show that we can fabricate TLM samples with good passivation properties. Using simulations, we also discuss on the influence of inhomogeneities in the excess minority carrier spatial concentration on the TLM analysis. These inhomogeneities, due to shading, local damages in the passivation or to carrier drift under bias voltage make the measurement complicated to carry out without significant error. Our results suggest that the measurement is more precise in darkness and at very high injection levels, under rear illumination and a low voltage bias.

Abstract: The quality of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) absorber layer, Mo/CZTS interface and heterojunction CZTS/CdS are the most important factors directly affecting the performance of CZTS solar cells. On the base of high quality absorber layer and back contact interface, the effects of post-heat treatment (PHT) process of CZTS/CdS on the quality of heterojunction and device performance have been comprehensively investigated. The PHT process can promote the elements in the heterojunction region interdiffuse between absorber and buffer layer, i.e., more Cd elements diffuse to CZTS, and Zn, Cu elements diffuse to CdS. Consequently, the elements interdiffusion affects the chemical composition of the absorber layer surface and the band alignment of the heterojunction. After applying the PHT process, the surface of CZTS becomes Cu-poorer in comparison to the CZTS bulk. Due to the diffusion of Cd2+into the CZTS layer, the free carrier density is increased. In addition, PHT process can also promote the recrystallization of CdS and thus greatly improve the crystallization quality of CdS. Owing to the more favorable band alignment at the CZTS/CdS interface as well as better crystallinity of CdS, higher quality heterojunction was obtained. Finally, at the optimized PHT temperature of 275 °C, a pure CZTS solar cell with active area efficiency of 9.75% (total area efficiency: 8.90%) has been fabricated. Based on the application of PHT process, reducing the deep level defects in CZTS bulk is expected to further improve the device performance.

Abstract: Analysis of stainless steel 316 as a containment material in the presence of a phase change material (PCM) cycled at high temperature was carried out through a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction methods. In this work, stainless steel tokens were half-immersed in a chloride carbonate-based PCM, which were then thermally cycled in an air or a nitrogen environment up to 500 times, allowing the PCM to repeatedly transform between solid and liquid phases. Spectroscopy and diffraction methods were applied on the tokens, as well as the cycled PCM, to investigate the extent and nature of corrosion in such steel alloys. With varying sputtering conditions, the oxidation state at different depths of token surfaces was quantified. From the outermost corroded layer through to the bulk, this study shows a gradual change in distribution in both Cr and oxidation of Fe, while Cr was specifically found to have depleted and migrated into the PCM. The oxidation and depletion have been found to increase with increasing exposure time to PCM while sigma-phase structure embrittled in the corrosion layer.

Abstract: The sunlight-heating and electricity-heating interfacial evaporation membrane (SHEHIEM), which is prepared mainly using wood pulp and MWCNTs and is directly driven by sunlight and electricity from photovoltaic panels, is adopt to produce more steam at a very low cost. The results show that some SHEHIEMs of different compositions, having higher steam yield in sunlight heating, can hardly run in electricity heating and the season is that the resistance of SHEHIEM changes sharply during absorbing water. Thus, according to resistance, hydrophilicity, steam yield, SEM, XRD, FTIR, TG, absorption spectra and tensile strength, the composition of SHEHIEM is determined and optimized. When the SHEHIEM is operated in only electricity heating, only sunlight heating, sunlight and electricity heating (S&E heating), the steam yield of S&E heating is the highest and 1.30 kg/m2 for 0.5 KW, 1.90 kg/m2 for 1 KW, 2.37 kg/m2 for 1.5 KW, 2.86 kg/m2 for 2 KW and 3.23 kg/m2 for 2.5 KW, respectively. Meantime, its energy conversion efficiencies are also the highest and 62.7% for 0.5 KW, 68.4% for 1 KW, 68.8% for 1.5 KW, 69.3% for 2 KW and 67.2% for 2.5 KW, respectively, and the SHEHIEM shows synergistic effects. For S&E heating of 1 kW/m2 and 2 kW/m2, 10 h consecutive tests show that the SHEHIEM has better stability. After evaporation, all the detected indicators meet the drinking water standard of WHO. In the open, when the SHEHIEM is run for 7 h in winter, the production water mass and energy conversion efficiencies are 9.03 kg/m2 and 55.4% for 1 KW and 15.67 kg/m2 and 61.0%.

Abstract: Background
The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the progression and recurrence of tumors and immunotherapy outcomes. The use of immune checkpoint blockers to improve the overall survival rate of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has yielded inconsistent outcomes. We examined the tumor microenvironment-related genes for their clinical significance and biological functions in hepatocellular carcinoma.
Methods
Bioinformatic analysis was performed to screen the differentially expressed genes and to identify the core gene of the tumor microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma. The expression of KIF18B in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and tumor samples was determined using western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. The malignancy-promoting ability of KIF18B was evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and xenograft tumor assays.
Results
KIF18B was identified as one of the core genes in the hepatocellular carcinoma microenvironment and was significantly associated with infiltrating immune cell subtypes and tumor cell stemness. Upregulation of KIF18B was associated with poor clinicopathological characteristics and poor patient outcomes; its downregulation inhibited the proliferation ability of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which was consistent with the findings of in vivo experiments. Knockdown of KIF18B inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition which reduced the migration and invasion abilities of tumor cells. A pulmonary metastasis model confirmed that the downregulation of KIF18B inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell metastasis in vivo.
Conclusion
KIF18B could be a useful marker for determining the treatment outcomes of immune checkpoint blockers in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: A proof-of-concept for implementing ultrathin dielectric/metal/dielectric layers of AZO/Ag/AZO (AZO: Al-doped ZnO) as a transparent electrode in the earth-abundant, kesterite-type Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) photovoltaic device, is presented. In a first step, a set of optical simulations for designing the layer sequence and the optimum thickness of AZO/Ag/AZO were performed, resulting in a high CZTS absorption within a device configuration of glass/Mo/MoS2/CZTS/CdS/ZnO/AZO/Ag/AZO. The simulation suggests that a high CZTS absorption in a device can be achieved using an Ag layer with a thickness of 7 nm embedded between a first and second AZO layer, having thicknesses of 50 nm and 40 nm, respectively. The AZO/Ag/AZO films were sputtered on a glass substrate with layer thicknesses based on the optical simulation, showing transmittance of >80% (including the substrate), sheet resistance of 10.5 Ω/sq and figure-of-merit of 29.6 × 10−3 Ω−1. These ultrathin transparent electrode properties were obtained without any substrate heating. The implementation of AZO/Ag/AZO as the transparent electrode in a CZTS photovoltaic device yielded a device efficiency of 8.2% with a short-circuit current density of 24.2 mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage of 576 mV and a fill factor of 58%. These results suggest an opportunity to reduce the nominal thickness of the front electrode material in CZTS photovoltaics.

Abstract: Urban overheating has a serious impact on building energy consumption. Daytime radiative cooling materials are an interesting passive solution for refrigeration. However, their costs and complex manufacturing hinder their current application. In this study, a series of scalable and lowcost daytime radiative cooling (DTRC) materials were designed, fabricated, and tested in a moderate climate (Cfb-Köppen-Geiger classification) and compared to aluminum and Vikuiti. The methodology was: i) material selection and design, (ii) optimization, (iii) fabrication, (iv) characterization, and (v) testing. The materials were fabricated using different substrates, aluminum and Vikuiti, and two kinds of formulations for the emissive layers based on silica-derived polymer polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ) with embedded silica nanoparticles. The resulting aluminum DTRC materials had a mean solar reflectivity of 0.7 and 0.34 emissivity in the atmospheric window, the samples with Vikuiti had 0.97 and 0.89, respectively. During the experiment, the samples were exposed to different ambient conditions without a convection barrier and were contained in an extruded polystyrene board to eliminate conduction. The samples reached 7.32 °C and 9.13 °C maximum surface temperature reduction (below ambient) during the day and night, respectively. The samples with the commercial substrate achieved a mean reduction of 3.72 °C below ambient temperature. Although the aluminum samples did not achieve subambient cooling throughout the entire day, the emissive layer reduced the sample's surface temperature by an average of 1.7 °C. The PMSQ radiative cooling materials show great potential for future building applications. Suitability under different climates and experimental settings should be done to test broad applicability.

Abstract: Based on Na2HPO4·12H2O as phase change material (PCM) and SiO2 hydrophilic modified expanded graphite (MEG) as supporting carrier and thermal conductivity enhancer, a novel Na2HPO4·12H2O/MEG form-stable composite PCM (CPCM) for radiant floor heating system was fabricated by physical mixing method. The SiO2 mass fraction in MEG and MEG content in CPCM were optimized. The adsorption performance of MEG on Na2HPO4·12H2O and morphology of MEG were systematically discussed. The shape stability, pore structure as well as thermal properties of the obtained CPCM were emphatically investigated. Experimental results showed that MEG containing 15% SiO2 possessed optimal hydrophilicity and adsorption capacity for Na2HPO4·12H2O. With MEG mass fraction of 20%, the CPCM exhibited suitable phase change temperature (33.52 °C), high phase change enthalpy (158.5 J/g), low supercooling degree (2.29 °C) as well as favorable thermal conductivity (1.077 W/m·K), along with the outstanding shape stability and thermal reliability. All these suggest that Na2HPO4·12H2O/MEG CPCM has great application potential in radiant floor heating system.

Abstract: In the mono-crystalline silicon passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC), the back side passivation film made up of Al2O3 + SiNx:H stacks is the mainstream design. In this paper, the effect of the thickness of Al2O3 passivation layer on the performance of the solar cell was studied, and the correlation between the refractive index (RI) of SiNx:H layer and the efficiency gain of the solar cell after regeneration was analyzed. The results indicate that the thickness of Al2O3 layer needs to be balanced between the surface passivation and bulk passivation of SiNx:H, and the lower RI of SiNx:H layer shows a better hydrogen passivation capability. During the restoration of the solar cell efficiency, a thinner Al2O3 layer facilitates a faster stabilization of the boron-oxygen complexes. Finally, a new five-layer SiNx:H film was designed for the back side passivation film, and a conversion efficiency of 22.56 % was achieved, which is 0.05 % higher than that of the solar cell with a single-layer SiNx:H film.

Abstract: Radiative cooling, a passive cooling method without energy consumption, provides a sustainable alternative for existing cooling strategies. Microstructures in porous polymers have enabled further optimization of radiative cooling efficiency through selective reflection and emission. While numerous fabrication strategies have been reported, there is still a critical need for scalable method with simplicity, low cost, and designable microstructures. Herein, we report a low-cost eco-friendly template method towards scalable production of porosity-controlled sponge emitter with high radiative cooling efficiency. We demonstrate the feasibility by preparing porous polydimethylsiloxane sponge emitter (P-PDMS) with NaCl template. By modulating the template-to-PDMS mass ratio, facile porosity control is realized and the obtained sponge-like porous structure endows PDMS with higher sub-ambient cooling ability enabled by enhanced emissivity and solar reflectivity. Furthermore, the heat transfer between hot air and the object is efficiently inhibited by the micropores. Combined theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the PDMS sponge has a remarkable reflectivity of 95% in solar spectrum and averaged emissivity of 96.5% within the 8–13 μm range, thus realizing excellent sub-ambient temperature drop of 8.0 °C.

Abstract: Objectives
The purpose of this study was to compare data obtained from the reticulocyte channel (RET channel) heated to 41°C with those obtained from impedance channel (I-Channel) at room temperature in the samples with the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)<370g/L and in samples with the MCHC>370g/L, in the presence of cold agglutinins.
Methods
In this study, 60 blood samples (group 1) with the MCHC<370g/L (without cold agglutinins) and 78 blood samples (group 2) with the MCHC>370g/L (with cold agglutinins) were used to compare the two analytical channels of the XN-9000 analyzer in different preanalytical conditions. The parameters evaluated in both groups were the following: red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean cell volume (MCV), RBC-most frequent volume (R-MFV), mean hemoglobin concentration (MCH) and mean cellular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).
Results
The results of this study showed an excellent correlation with both channels of the XN-9000 analyzer in samples with and without cold agglutinins, except for the MCHC. The bias between the values obtained in the I-channel and those obtained in the RET channel of both groups was insignificant and remained within the limits of acceptability, as reported by Ricos et al. for all considered parameters, except for MCHC.
Conclusions
The presence of cold agglutinins in blood samples can be detected by a spurious lowering of the RBC count and by a spurious increase in the MCHC. The RET channel represents a great opportunity to correct the RBC count in a rapid manner without preheating. However, neither methodology can completely solve the residual presence of cold agglutinins in all samples, despite the MCHC values being < 370g/L.

Abstract: Molten salts are applied in solar thermal power plant as heat transfer and heat storage medium. In this work, the thermal stability of quaternary nitrate-nitrite (QNN) mixed salt and Solar salt are studied under three constant temperature conditions (500 °C, 565 °C, 600 °C) for 1008h. The results show that the mass ratio of NO2−1/NO3−1plays an important role in the thermal physical properties of nitrite/nitrate molten salt. The mass ratio of NO2−1/NO3−1 in Solar salt increases with the increasing of working temperature, which results in the decreasing of melting point and initial crystal temperature and the increasing of decomposition temperature. The average values of melting point and initial crystal temperature of QNN mixed salt are maximum 119 °C and 24 °C lower than that of Solar salt. Meanwhile, the maximum increase of average values of specific heat and thermal conductivity of QNN mixed salt are 14.26%, 8.18% compared with its base salt, respectively. When the working temperature is higher than decomposition temperature, average values of specific heat and thermal conductivity of Solar salt decrease because of the acceleration of nitrite formation. The viscosity values of QNN mixed salt and Solar salt decrease with the increasing of temperature. Based on the comparative analysis, QNN mixed salt has good application value in practical engineering applications.

Abstract: Microcapsules can prevent leakage and increase the specific surface area of phase change materials (PCMs). Among them, metal microcapsule has great application prospects in the field of medium/high temperature thermal energy storage. However, it is easy to break after thermal cycling which seriously hinder its industrial application. To solve this problem, a novel alloy microcapsule with a void was prepared successfully with SnBi58 alloy as the core and TiO2 as the shell by “double-layer coating, sacrificial inner layer” method, which can accommodate volume expansion during heat storage, thus fundamentally solving the problem of microcapsule break caused by thermal expansion. The test results indicated that the SnBi58 microcapsules melt at 141.1°Cand crystallize at 128.1 °C. It has latent heats of 46.61 J/g and 38.20 J/g for melting and crystallization, respectively. The thermal cycle test also showed that MEPCM with a void has better thermal reliability and durability than that of MEPCM without void. In addition, due to the wall material of TiO2, the microcapsules showed good photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, “double-layer coating, sacrificial inner layer” method can be widely used to prepare other metal microcapsule and it provides a new perspective for metal microencapsulation.

Abstract: Mixed organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received considerable attention in recent years for their impressive solar to electrical power efficiency gains and potentially lower material and processing costs for optoelectronic applications. In addition to terrestrial applications, PSCs are of interest to the space power markets for their low cost, low weight, adaptability to flexible architectures, and tolerance to high energy particle irradiation (mainly protons and electrons). Here we investigate the properties of mixed formamidinium-methylammonium tin-lead iodide (FASn)0.6(MAPb)0.4I3 perovskites which lower the lead content as well as the bandgap, making them attractive for the low bandgap absorber material in tandem PSCs. Through current density-voltage (JV) characterization at lower temperatures, majority carrier transport is hindered and a barrier to photogenerated carrier extraction is evident. This is attributed to the thermally induced change of the bandgap of the absorber layer relative to the energy selective contacts in the device. We find that although the architecture used here hinders the performance at temperatures below 225 K, the tolerance to high energy (3.7 MeV) protons is impressive, considerably out-performing commercially available thin-film CIGS. These results suggest further improvements to structural and interface stability as well as lightweight encapsulation could lead to all perovskite flexible tandem arrays deployed for power generation on missions to low Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

Abstract: For P-doped glass frits, the doping efficiency of phosphorus is low because of the volatility of phosphorus at high temperatures. A lead-free 5% P-doped glass frit was prepared using low-temperature phosphorus diffusion. The network structure formed by the glass was mainly composed of [BiO6] octahedron, [SiO4] tetrahedron, and [BO4] tetrahedron. The pore size of the glass frit was distributed in the mesopore range. High-temperature microscopy confirmed that the glass frit began to soften at 620 °C. The glass frit was prepared into a front silver paste for multicrystalline silicon solar cells. The high efficiency of P2O5 doping helped resolve problematic defects caused by the typically poor doping efficiency of P-doping while forming the n-type emitter and p-n junction of solar cell. Finally, the solar cell photovoltaic conversion efficiency improved to 18.3%.

Abstract: Background
We previously demonstrated that M-PDT is painless and effective in precancerous skin diseases treatment. However, whether M-PDT is effective in cSCC and the underlying inhibitory mechanism remains enigmatic.
Objective
We aims to unveil the effect of M-PDT on cSCC cell proliferation and the regulatory effect of M-PDT on MAPK signaling.
Methods
The proliferation and migration of cSCC cells were revealed by CCK8 assay, tumor sphere formation assay and scratch assay respectively. The expression of MAPKs was examined by western blot. The activity of PP2A and PP5 was regulated by inhibitor and recombinant adenoviruses.
Results
Here, we show that M-PDT inhibits cSCC cell proliferation by activating p-JNK, p-p38 and inhibiting p-Erk1/2, as well as activation of PP2A and inactivation of PP5. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PP2A conferred resistance to M-PDT’s suppression on p-Erk1/2 and attenuated inhibitory effects of M-PDT on cell proliferation whereas overexpression of wild-type PP2A showed the contrary results. Pharmacological inhibition of PP5 potentiated M-PDT’s elevation on p-JNK and strengthened inhibitory effects of M-PDT on cell proliferation whereas overexpression of wild-type PP5 exhibited the contrary results.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that M-PDT inhibits cSCC cell proliferation via targeting PP2A/PP5-mediated MAPK signaling pathway.

Abstract: Radiative cooling (RC) has attracted growing attention in recent years since it is a terrestrial object that radiates heat to outer space through the atmospheric window while maintaining zero-energy consumption. It emits or absorbs radiation only in the atmospheric window (8–13 μm) and suppress it beyond this band. In this paper, we present a radiative cooling coating composed of a zirconia (ZrO2) embedded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) hybrid ZrO2/PDMS coating. The influences on radiative cooling by particle sizes and volume fractions and film thicknesses are evaluated via Mie scatter theory combined with Monte Carlo ray-tracing method. The ZrO2/PDMS coatingdis plays a surface temperature drop 10.9 °C at the solar intensity of 895 W/m2, much better than the commercial white paint (4.4 °C). As it performs efficiently above ambient temperature and is easy to manufacture this coating, this coating may have some promising future for potential large-scale application of radiative cooling technology on energy-saving buildings.

Abstract: In this work, the latent heat enhanced polyethylene glycol (PEG)/cellulose aerogel (CA)-dopamine form-stable composite phase change materials (PCD fs-CPCMs) were constructed by facile in-situ fabrication method based on the freeze casting. Under the simultaneous synergistic effect of CA and dopamine modification, the PCD fs-CPCMs achieved ultra-high encapsulation capacity of ~95 wt% and latent heat of ~194.3 J/g. Furtherly, compared with before the dopamine modification, the latent heat of PCD fs-CPCMs was increased by ~18.9%, and the difference between theoretical and experimental value was significantly reduced, indicating that the modification effectively promoted phase change behavior and improved heat storage characteristic of PEG. The ultra-high encapsulation capacity was mainly attributed to the lightweight and porous characteristic of CA and the effective entanglement and combination of PEG molecular chain. The increased latent heat was mainly ascribed to the construction of new combination approaches among PEG, CA and dopamine, resulting in the weakening of hydrogen bond effect (before and after modification: O-H⋯O > O-H⋯N or N-H⋯O) so that the confinement effect of surfaces was weakened and modified surface-induced phase change behavior was promoted. Moreover, the PCD fs-CPCMs exhibited excellent chemical compatibility, reasonable heat storage and release rates, and acceptable thermal reliability and stability.

Abstract: The corrosion behavior of an electroless Ni–P coating on low-Cr X20CrMoV12-1 steel as a cost-efficient substrate-coating combination is investigated in molten NaNO3–KNO3 nitrates at 600 °C. Results indicated that the as-deposited Ni–P coating was transformed to a thermally treated diffusion coating upon exposure to the molten salt without additional heat treatment prior to the exposure. Detailed evolution of the Ni–P coating and the oxidation behavior during the 1000-h immersion test is discussed. Results showed competitive corrosion resistance of the coating system compared to that of the sophisticated Ni alloy 230, with the advantage of an inherent barrier against Cr dissolution form the substrate. The significant corrosion resistance of the electroless plated Ni–P coating is attributed in part to the protective Ni--rich oxide scale and in other part to the in-situ formed Ni3P barrier at the oxide-substrate interphase boundary.

Abstract: The use of Ga-doped Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafers in Passivated Emitter and Rear Cells (PERC) has been confirmed to have a prominent advantage in suppressing light-induced degradation (LID), which will attract considerable attention for the application of Ga-doped wafers in more efficient photovoltaic devices. In this work, we investigate the passivation quality and address the issue of LID in Ga-doped CZ Si wafers equipped with p-type polysilicon passivating contact that consists of an ultrathin SiOx and a heavily doped polysilicon. We also present the modeling results for solar cells using this type of contact. The experiments show that samples with Ga-doped CZ Si wafers have superior anti-LID properties when compared to the samples with B-doped wafers. An excellent passivation performance with a high implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of 705 mV and a low single-sided saturation current density (J0,s) of 9 fA/cm2 was achieved. Moreover, with the help of the numerical simulations, we predict that the p-type Ga-doped CZ Si solar cells with p-type polysilicon passivating contacts have the potential to achieve a high efficiency of 23.8%, an ~0.5% absolute efficiency improvement over that of PERC solar cells. The results demonstrated in this study suggest that Ga-doped CZ Si wafers combined with p-type polysilicon passivating contacts could resolve the LID issue while maintaining good passivation properties, providing a promising alternative for p-type solar cells in the photovoltaic industry.

Abstract: Improved radiation absorption in an ultra-wideband region is typically beneficial for broadband spectroscopy, optical absorbers, etc. Moreover, hydrophobic biocompatible surfaces can be integrated with optical devices for bio-applications. For silicon (Si), the absorption is confined to wavelengths lower than ~1100 nm. This work proposes three biocompatible configurations (i.e., type A, B and C) for Si-based ultra-wideband optical applications, comprising variable-sized gold (Au)-islands and titanium (Ti)-compounds. We report the quantum effects of nano Au-islands using the Brus equation and the impact of the Schottky barrier formed by micro Au-islands on n-Si. We illustrate how these size-dependent Au-islands on n-Si can be used to tune the surface reflections and the optical absorption for wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (~200 nm) to infrared (~3300 nm). Our proposed surface modifications contain three to five bulk fabrication steps and do not involve photolithography or electron-beam lithography techniques. Type A involves only blanket deposition and annealing processes. However, type B and C involve Au-island assisted anisotropic surface texturing of Si, in addition to deposition and annealing. Additionally, we show how an optimized layer of Ti-compounds on Au-islands/n-Si or Au-islands/textured n-Si can further improve the optical characteristics and act as a protective encapsulation, enabling self-cleaning behavior for Si surfaces.

Abstract: Acute promyelocytic leukemia is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia, characterized by the presence of neoplastic promyelocytes, due to the reciprocal balanced translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17. Currently, with the use of agents that act directly on this molecular change, such as all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide, APL has shifted from a highly mortal to a curable disease. However, some cases are still at high risk of death, especially early death, and acquiring a better understanding of the clinical and biological factors involving APL is needed to correctly identify and treat such cases. The early suspected diagnosis and prompt initiation of the target therapy are important for better response rates. The follow-up and outcomes, using real-life data from 44 consecutive APL patients, were studied between 2001 and 2013. The overall survival rate was 82.7% and early death was 16%. Almost all patient deaths were due to severe bleeding, which was confirmed by multivariate analysis, as the most important prognostic factor leading to death. A better understanding the pathogenesis of the hemorrhagic complications in APL is needed, as well as the risk factors associated with early death in APL patients, as this has become synonymous with overall mortality.

Abstract: Recovery of rare metal indium from waste crystalline silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar cells is important with the large-scale development of photovoltaic industry, is becoming economically and environmentally justified. Thus, the objective of this work is to study hydrometallurgical recovery of indium and valuable materials from HJT solar cells. In addition, to study some parameters used in this process. In this study, three key processes including pretreatment, acid leaching and optimization design on singer-factor to minimize waste of resources were proposed and implemented. Firstly, the samples were characterized by Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) showed indium concentrations of 2950 mg/kg. Then, reacting with NaOH 10% at 90 °C for 8 min can separate the silver electrodes on the surface of the cells, which realize the primary recovery of the silver electrode. After this, the influence of acid type, acid concentration, retention time and temperature on indium leaching was analyzed. Subsequently, the BBD method under response surface methodology was used to optimize the leaching rate. Optimum operating conditions include a leaching step for 148 min at 93.2 °C in the presence of H2SO4 6 mol/L with extraction rate of 95.2% and validate the feasibility with determination coefficient (99.55%) of the RSM model.

Abstract: We report oleylamine functionalized NiOx (f-NiOx) and CNT composite (f-NiOx + CNT) as hole transport material in n-i-p low-temperature processed carbon counter electrode based perovskite solar cells. Oleylamine functionalization improves the dispersibility of NiOx, but it reduces the conductivity. We demonstrate the addition of a small amount of CNT significantly enhances the conductivity and charge transport properties. The morphological and optoelectrical properties of prepared nanoparticles were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV–Vis spectroscopy. The results suggest suitable energy band alignment of f-NiOx+CNT hole transport material with FA0.83Cs0.17PbI2.5Br0.5 perovskite absorber layer. Better hole extraction and transport were provided by f-NiOx + CNT hole transport material, with improved conductivity of 2.73 × 10−2 S cm−1. The fabricated device exhibits 11.36% efficiency with exceptional stability for more than 720 h (retaining ~ 60% of initial efficiency) in ambient without encapsulation. Additionally, we have also demonstrated the perovskite mini-module by connecting two small area cells in series, making the active area of 4 cm2 with 6.11% efficiency.

Abstract: Functional materials play a crucial role in the design of smart windows that can provide a more comfortable indoor environment for people to enjoy a better lifestyle. A traditional smart window material tends to have only a single feature wherein the color change is led by solar energy input. It was known that different color tones have a significant influence on people's emotions. Herein, our group has adopted a strategy to combine the properties of an electro- and thermo-chromic in a single layer (all-in-one) ionogel. In this work, 3-chloro-N-isopropylacetamide containing thermo-responsive poly [VNIm][TFSI] based electroactive has been synthesized for multi-responsive device. Ionogel, consisting of MBV [TFSI], ferrocene, and poly [VNIm][TFSI], was utilized to construct a single layer (all-in-one) device (with and without water). The proposed ionogel based device 1 (with water) that could offer a useful response to surrounding environments by switching between opaque and transparent in the aqueous condition through a temperature change. This kind of device 1 can be utilized as an individual privacy smart windows, under specific conditions. On the other hand, the ionogel based device 2 (without water) exhibits remarkable electrochromic performance through a reversible color change between colorless to purple color once 1.8 V was applied at 25 °C (below UCST) and gave a high (ΔT) of 74.9% and a coloration efficiency (CE) of 229.03 cm2 C−1 with coloration and bleaching times of 10.2 s and 100 s, respectively, while the tone changes from purple to blue when the device 2 is above UCST (52 °C). These phenomena are caused by the synergetic effect of its electrochromic reaction and thermochromic behavior. The device 2 maintained its switching stability for >2000 cycles. This novel strategy of integrating thermo- and electrochromic materials into a single device will lead to the development of the next generation of multifunctional smart windows.

Abstract: A systematic study was performed to measure the effective thermal conductivity of ceramic particle beds, a promising heat transfer and thermal energy storage medium for concentrating solar power (CSP). The thermal conductivity of the ceramic particle beds was measured using a transient hot-wire (THW) method within a temperature range of room temperature to 700 °C, the target operating temperature of the next-generation CSP systems. Two different types of ceramic particles were examined: (1) CARBOBEAD HSP 40/70 and (2) CARBOBEAD CP 40/100 (also known as ACCUCAST ID 50) with the average particle sizes of ~405 μm and ~275 μm, respectively, and thermal conductivities ranging from ~0.25 W m−1 K−1 to ~0.50 W m−1 K−1 from 20 °C to 700 °C in both air and N2 gas. The gaseous pressure dependence of the thermal conductivity of the ceramic particle beds was also studied in the N2 environment to differentiate the contributions from gas conduction, solid conduction, and radiation. Calculations using the Zehner, Bauer, and Schlünder (ZBS) model showed good agreements with the measurements. Based on the model, it is concluded that the effective thermal conductivity of the packed particle beds is dominated by the gas conduction while the solid conduction and radiation contributes to about 20% of the effective thermal conductivity at high temperature.

Abstract: Distortions in the current–voltage curves of CdTe-based thin-film solar cells with MgZnO emitter layers are not uncommon. Even when such distortions are very subtle with standard sunlight, they can be greatly accentuated by the removal of short-wavelength photons with optical filters, and the dark-curve turn-on voltage can be noticeably increased. The strong suggestion is that good J–V curves with full-spectrum light often rely on photogeneration of electrons from trap states in the MgZnO emitter. When the carrier concentration of the CdTe absorber is increased with external doping, there is a corresponding need for a larger MgZnO carrier concentration. Based on the assumption that the emitter carrier concentration needs to be comparable to that of the absorber, Ga-doping of the MgZnO was shown to very nearly eliminate the large filtered-light distortions and is arguably superior to MgZnO that relies on photogeneration. In addition, it was shown that photogeneration and recovery in MgZnO is relatively slow, so that without Ga-doping, the cell efficiency improves gradually for most of an hour in the light, and the turn-on voltage of the dark curve increases on a similar time scale when the light is removed.

Abstract: This paper focus on the study of peritectic compound Li4(OH)3Br for thermal energy storage in solar power applications. A thoroughly characterization of Li4(OH)3Br as storage material has been performed by measuring transition temperatures (280–289 °C), enthalpies of transition (247 J/g), specific heats (c.a. 1.68 J/g/K in solid, 2.52 J/g/K in liquid) and thermal conductivity (0.47 W/m/K at room temperature). The effect of the synthesis conditions on the storage properties has been investigated as well. It is concluded that neither the cooling rate applied during the synthesis stage nor the type of atmosphere used (ambient air and protective argon atmosphere) has an influence on the material's performance. The stability of the material to thermal cycling has also been analysed, showing good cycling stability. Moreover, particular attention is paid to the elucidation of mechanisms of formation of Li4(OH)3Br. It is shown that Li4(OH)3Br needs neither the presence nor contact with the pro-peritectic phase to form. It nucleates and grows directly from the melt so as pure-phase Li4(OH)3Br final microstructure is achieved. An attempt to enhance the storage capacity of the material by addition of different types of carbon nanoparticles has been carried out. Assets of Li4(OH)3Br as storage materials for high-pressure DSG solar power plants have been assessed through comparison with reference material NaNO3. Main advantages of Li4(OH)3Br are higher volumetric latent heat storage capacity (+54%) and lower volume changes during phase transitions (3% vs. 11%), which would translate into smaller storage tanks (−33%), lower size heat exchangers and longer lifetime.

Abstract: To manipulate the melting temperature of phase change material for more flexible match with practical applications, two eutectic mixtures of BHO (barium hydroxide octahydrate)-KCl and BHO-KNO3 were investigated as novel binary inorganic eutectic system in this study. Given that the latent heat of BHO-KNO3 eutectic mixture was higher than that of BHO-KCl eutectic mixture, then BHO-KNO3/EG (expanded graphite) composite phase change material (CPCM) with high thermal conductivity was fabricated by melting impregnation method. The thermal properties and performance were assessed using differential scanning calorimeter, thermogravimetry analyzer and thermal conductivity test. The crystalline structure and morphology were revealed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. These results revealed that the two eutectic mixtures still possessed high latent heat more than 200J/g when containing 10 wt% KCl and 12 wt% KNO3, respectively. In light of the similar melting temperatures of the two eutectic mixtures, it could be concluded that melting point altering was related to K+. It was worth noting that for BHO-KNO3/EG composite phase change material, EG not only improved the thermal conductivity up to 7.27 W•m-1•K-1 as an excellent heat transfer enhancement filler, but also reduced the supercooling degree by 7.6 °C as an effective nucleation-site provider.

Abstract: Introduction
The radiosynovectomy (RS) is one treatment option for recurrent hemarthrosis in patients with hemophilia (PWH). A prospective cohort study was designed to evaluate the effects of the RS on the synovial membrane volume in the ankles and knees of PWH and patient characteristics related to the RS outcome.
Methods
In a one-year follow-up, 25 joints of 22 PWH who presented 3 bleeds or more in the same joint over the last 6 months (target joints) were subjected to the RS. Two groups were compared: those who retained target joints following the RS and those who did not (less than 3 bleeds/6 months after the RS). The groups were analyzed according to age, hemophilia type/severity, joint, body mass index (BMI), inhibitor and Hemophilia Joint Health Score 2.1 (HJHS). The magnetic resonance images (MRI) of six ankles and six knees were acquired prior to, and 6 months after, the RS. The synovial membrane volume and arthropathy MRI scale were accessed and volumes were compared and correlated with the Yttrium-90 dose injected.
Results
Patients with a mean age of 12 years and a mean HJHS of 6.7 (p < 0.05) retained target joints after the RS. The inhibitor, joint, type/severity of disease and BMI showed no significant differences between groups. The synovial membrane volume had a significant reduction after the RS (p = 0.03), but no correlation with the Yttrium-90 dose. In proportion to the synovial membrane volume, doses injected to the ankles were larger than those injected to the knees.
Conclusion
The synovial membrane volume is reduced after the RS, regardless of the effective 90Y dose.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Mixed chimerism is a major concern after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen in primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). A donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) escalating dose regimen has been developed with the aim of reducing toxicity while preserving efficacy. However, the graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) development remains the most common and adverse effect of DLI and continues to be a limiting factor in its application, especially nonmalignant diseases such as PIDs. We prospectively evaluated PID patients after HSCT using RIC in Children s Medical Center, who were candidates for an escalating dose of DLI for MC from 2016 to 2018.
Methods
With the median follow-up of 16.4 months, 12 patients (nine males and three females) with a median age of 3.72 years received DLI. The median number of DLI was 3.2 (range, 1–5), the maximum and total dose of DLIs administered per patient were 3.6 × 107 (range, 1–5) cells/kg CD3+ and 9.3 × 107 (range, 1–15) cells/kg CD3+ cells, respectively.
Results
Median donor chimerism at baseline before the DLIs was 41% (range, 11–73%), patients received DLIs at a median of 105 (range, 37–230) days and 52 (range, 3–168) days after the HSCT and onset of the MC, respectively. At the final assessment, six (54.5%) patients improved after DLIs at a median of 47.3 days.
Conclusion
PID patients may benefit from DLI with an escalating dose regimen, but the GvHD development remains a concern during the DLI, and the optimum dose and frequency must be standardized.

Abstract: So far, intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H(i)) has been commonly used below molybdenum oxide (MoOx) to form a good contact. An a-Si:H(i)/MoOx stack gives good surface passivation, but often results in poor carrier selectivity after exposure to slightly elevated temperatures >130 °C (Geissbühler et al., 2015) [1]. For this reason, we have investigated an alternative interface layer, a very thin Al2O3 tunneling layer (<2 nm), deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), that can provide surface passivation, higher transparency and thermal stability without affecting the hole transport across the contact. To demonstrate this new passivating contact a 6” moly-poly cell, with an Al2O3/MoOx stack at the front side and n-type doped polysilicon at the rear side, was made using a high- throughput spatial ALD tool, and E-beam PVD, for the Al2O3 and MoOx layers, respectively. This resulted in an efficiency of 18.2% with a Voc of 651 mV, a FF of 75.6% and a Jsc of 36.9 mA/cm2. A post-deposition anneal (PDA) of the thin Al2O3 interlayer has significant effect on the Al2O3 thickness, layer stoichiometry, contact selectivity, and sputtering-induced damage. Annealing at higher TPDA (350–600 °C) results in ineffective hole carrier transport and makes the stack more sensitive to ITO damage. The best performing device was, therefore, made using an Al2O3 layer without a PDA treatment. Moreover, we have found that this solar cell structure is thermally stable up to at least 210 °C, and even slightly improves under annealing which makes this device industrially appealing.

Abstract: Motivated by possible application of InGaN/GaN multi-quantum well solar cells in hybrid concentrated photovoltaic / solar thermal power conversion systems, we have analyzed the temperature and intensity dependence of the open-circuit voltage of such devices up to 725 K and more than 1000 suns. We show that the simple ABC model routinely used to analyze the measured quantum efficiency data of InGaN/GaN LEDs can accurately reproduce the temperature and intensity dependence of the measured open-circuit voltage if a temperature-dependent Shockley–Read–Hall lifetime is used and device heating is taken into account.

Abstract: Extraction of contact resistivity (ρc) with the four-point probe (4PP) method requires considerably fewer fabrication and measurement steps compared to conventional alternatives (e.g. the transfer length method, TLM). Yet, the method is rarely used, mainly due to the requirement of 3D simulations used in the data fitting procedure. Moreover, a work analyzing the details of the method, which can provide a quantitative guideline to the users, is lacking in the literature. In this work, we show that the 3D simulations can be replaced with a spreading resistance model (SRM) implemented in a numerical calculation platform (e.g. MATLAB). Using the SRM, we achieve drastically short calculation durations (<1 s) compared to durations of 3D simulations based on the finite element method. We show that the resolution and reliability of the extracted ρc depends critically on geometrical and electrical parameters of the system, such as the probe tip spacing and sheet resistances of the layers. We also present an alternative measurement procedure that is fully based on 4PP measurements of only one substrate, which eliminates the need for an eddy-current measurement or an additional set of dedicated samples. We demonstrate the viability of the 4PP method in experiments by comparing the results with those obtained by the TLM, for ρc between 5 × 10−3 to 1 × 100 Ω cm2. Lastly, we provide a free software that can execute the calculations discussed herein.

Abstract: The development and deployment of photovoltaic power plants is still growing all over the world with the significant decrease of costs and by reducing the energy dependence to fossil fuels especially in some countries in the MENA region. Besides, to the abundant solar radiation in this region, the semi-arid and arid climate promote harsh weather conditions as high dust concentration which cause a significant degradation on the power production and performance of the PV systems. Dust analysis and the transmittance soiling loss with regard to the dust surface density under real conditions for glass samples exposed on fixed tilt with 32° and tracking system with horizontally stow position during the night were investigated in the mid-south of Morocco for a period of one year from June 29th, 2018 until June 28th, 2019. The results indicate that the transmittance drop is generally significant for the fixed PV system and is strictly dependent on climatic conditions during the investigation period. The accumulation rate of dust decrease the optical transmittance over 28% after 30 days of exposure, which reduce the electrical energy of the PV system by 4.4%. In addition, by increasing dust surface density from 0 g/m2 to 1.1 g/m2, the electrical power reduces by 14.2% for the fixed PV system. On the other hand, the results have demonstrated that for a PV module exposed for one year at the same climate conditions, the electrical performances have decreased by 27% after 8 months of exposure without any cleaning event.

Abstract: Because the perovskites materials tend to decompose in humid air and at high temperature, a controlled inert condition is usually necessary to obtain high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which is inconvenient for large-scale commercial production. Furthermore, defects/traps in the perovskite layer, as non-radiative charge recombination centers, dramatically deteriorate the device efficiency and stability. Inspired by the Lewis acid-base adduct theory, herein we report a terephthalic acid (PTA)-assisted defect passivation strategy for fabricating highly efficient and stable devices in ambient air. Density functional theory calculation confirms that electrons are located at two carboxylic acid end groups in the PTA molecule, which can serve as Lewis base to form the Lewis acid-base adduct with uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. The PTA-treatment effects promote high performance of PSCs, the champion device provides power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.22%, in sharp contrast to 17.41% of control sample. More importantly, unencapsulated devices retain over 80% of their original PCE after being stored for 4500 h in air (≈45% average relative humidity (RH)), exhibiting one of the best long-term stability to date. Correspondingly, PTA-treatment gives the device favorable thermal stability. Our strategy provides a simple yet effective path for passivating defects and improving performance of PSCs.

Abstract: Background
We previously described a risk prediction model (Anne Arundel Medical Center [AAMC] model) based on pathology which may eliminate the need for recurrence score (RS) testing in select early-stage breast cancers. There is a concern that patients in discordant risk prediction groups (AAMC vs. RS) may be overtreated or undertreated if RS testing were omitted.
Methods
We queried the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for all breast cancer patients between 2004 and 2015. AAMC low-risk was defined as Grade 1 and progesterone receptor-positive (PR + ) tumors, while AAMC high-risk was defined as Grade 3 or estrogen-negative tumors. RS low-risk group was defined as RS < 16 and age ≤ 50 years, or RS ≤ 25 and age > 50 years. RS high-risk group was defined as RS > 25.
Results
A total of 71,212 cases were analyzed. Of these, 590 were AAMC low-risk/RS high-risk discordant, while 5,596 were AAMC high-risk/RS low-risk discordant. For AAMC low-risk/RS high-risk discordant, 10-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) did not differ for patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy versus those who did not (93% chemotherapy vs. 99% unknown/no chemotherapy, p = .12). Overall survival (OS) was also comparable (92% chemotherapy vs. 91% unknown/no chemotherapy, p = .42). In the AAMC high-risk/RS low-risk discordant group, 10-year BCSS (92% chemotherapy vs. 96% unknown/no chemotherapy, p = .06) and OS (87% chemotherapy vs. 90% unknown/no chemotherapy, p = .52) did not differ between adjuvant chemotherapy and unknown/no chemotherapy groups.
Conclusions
Adjuvant chemotherapy in the AAMC low-risk/RS high-risk and AAMC high-risk/RS low-risk discordant groups did not improve survival. This supports consideration of omission of RS testing in Grade 1, PR + tumors. Patients with Grade 3 tumors do benefit from RS testing.

Abstract: Converting solar energy into electricity is highly appealing for portable wearable devices. Herein, an facile low-temperature in situ interface polymerization is proposed to fabricate poly (3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-based polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber film (PAN-PEDOT). Owing to the synergy of PEDOT and fabric light traps, the fabricated PAN-PEDOT owns excellent photo-thermoelectric performances with a power factor of ~256.61 nWm−1 k−2. Accordingly, a photo-thermoelectric harvester assembled by the optimum PAN-PEDOT strip and the copper wires reached a 0.17 mV voltage output under infrared (IR) light. Furthermore, a flexible textile solar panel assembled using the optimum PAN-PEDOT and the conductive nanofiber films were placed under an IR lamp and sunlight to investigate its performance in on-body applications. Results showed that the solar panel can obtain a voltage outputs of 1.39 mV and 0.56 mV and a power outputs of 0.37 nW and 0.06 nW under an IR lamp and sunlight, respectively. Therefore, the photo-thermoelectric fabric has high potential in solar-to-heat and solar-to-electricity applications.

Abstract: Polysilicon/oxide (poly-Si/SiOx) passivating contacts are a promising technology for the next-generation of high-efficiency silicon solar cells. The structure can be realised by a range of fabrication techniques, which can induce very different impurity gettering effects during the formation process. Understanding the different gettering effects will enable tailored solutions to optimise the gettering efficiency in device fabrication. This paper demonstrates a method to separately quantify the impact of each component on the overall gettering effect of the poly-Si/SiOx passivating contact structures. These components consist of the heavily doped poly-Si layer, in terms of its gettering strength; the SiOx interlayer, regarding its potential blocking effect for slowing down the diffusion of impurities; and the dopant in-diffused surface regions of the silicon wafer bulk directly below the SiOx interlayer, which may have a small additional gettering effect due to heavy doping. Phosphorus in-situ doped poly-Si layers from plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), coupled with SiOx interlayers from different growth techniques, were used to demonstrate the method. The experimental and simulation results confirm that the heavily doped poly-Si layer acts as the main gettering sink and the presence of different SiOx interlayers determines the overall gettering rate. For the ultrathin SiOx interlayers studied in this work, which have a similar thickness but different stoichiometry, a standard thermally grown SiOx demonstrates the strongest blocking effect, followed by a chemically grown SiOx from hot nitric acid, and a thermal SiOx of a reduced stoichiometry (grown in a pure nitrogen ambient) demonstrates practically no blocking effect.

Abstract: Photovoltaic conversion technologies took the opportunity to trap the abundant solar energy, but soiling reduces these device's energy yield. In this endeavor, we developed a novel anti-soiling coating with excellent weather stability to counter the challenges posed by soiling. The developed anti-soiling coating characteristics like ambient condition curablity, good mechanical and weather stability to encounter the real field conditions are because of the bonding of functionalized hybrid Zr-O-Si network with the glass. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy analysis indicate the presence of the functionalized hybrid Zr-O-Si network in the coating. The coating exhibited good thermal stability up to 150 °C and observed a minimal decrement of < 4° in the water contact angle over 100 h. The coating's weather stability was analyzed by adapting IEC 61646 standards for 1500 h with a temperature range of 85 °C & -40 °C and maximum relative humidity of 85% and the coating was found to be more stable than commercial anti-soiling coating. The developed coating shows no loss in angle resolved transmission in the range of 10–80°. The coated panel showed an excellent anti-soiling effect and a net reduction of 24.5 % in the soiling losses are observed compared to that of the not-coated panel over 50 days. The developed coating is combination of different unique characterstics such as, scalable coating technique, ambient condition curability, good mechanical, weather stability and anti-soiling properties that distinguish this work from prior state of the art.

Abstract: The purpose of this investigation is to find and prepare novel heat storage materials to meet the requirement of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) system. This paper focuses on the formulation, fabrication and characterization of a novel molten salt nanocomposite for high-temperature heat energy storage. The molten salt nanocomposite is based on eutectic quaternary salt, and two different concentrations of SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles are added to improve its specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity by microwave method. Concerning the material characterization, a suite of techniques was used, including simultaneous thermal analysis (STA) and laser flash analysis (LFA). The consequences demonstrate that the melting point and latent heat of molten salt nanocomposites can be reduced by adding two different concentrations of nanoparticles at the same time. The specific heat is 28.1% higher than that of the pure quaternary salt, and 6.3% and 9.8% higher than that of adding SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles separately when adding 0.1 wt% SiO2 and 0.9 wt% TiO2 nanoparticles to the quaternary nitrate. Compared with pure quaternary salt, the thermal conductivity of the molten salt nanocomposites increased by 53.7%, which was 16.8% and 6.3% higher than that of adding SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles separately. Upon inspection with scanning electron microscopy, a high-density nanostructure and heat transfer channel were observed, which appear to be the reason for the enhancement of specific heat and thermal conductivity of the material. Finally, the molten salt nanocomposite has a broad application prospects in high-temperature thermal storage system.

Abstract: Plasmonic thermochromic films are promising for smart window applications. Hereby, we develop a flexible plasmonic thermochromic film towards multifunctionality. The double-layer film consists of a bottom layer of W/Mg co-doped vanadium dioxide (VO2) rods in a polyurethane acrylate matrix and a top layer of hollow silica spheres (HSSs). Based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, we demonstrate for the first time, a transverse and a longitudinal mode of VO2 localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) in near- and mid-infrared bands, respectively, and only the transverse mode contributes to the solar energy modulation performance. The film shows a luminous transmittance of 46.2%, a solar energy modulation of 10.8%, and a critical transition temperature of 36.9 °C. The HSSs overcoating enhances the surface hydrophilicity and thermal insulation, which give rise to more favored functionalities for windows.

Abstract: The nucleus provides a physical and selective chemical boundary to segregate the genome from the cytoplasm. The contents of the nucleus are surrounded by the nuclear envelope, which acts as a hub of mechanosensation, transducing forces from the external cytoskeleton to the nucleus, thus impacting on nuclear morphology, genome organisation, gene transcription and signalling pathways. Muscle tissues such as the heart are unique in that they actively generate large contractile forces, resulting in a distinctive mechanical environment which impacts nuclear properties, function and mechanosensing. In light of this, mutations that affect the function of the nuclear envelope (collectively known as nuclear envelopathies and laminopathies) disproportionately result in striated muscle diseases, which include dilated and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. Here we review the nucleus and its role in mechanotransduction, as well as associated defects that lead to cardiac dysfunction.

Abstract: Hydrogen can be generated by the photolysis of water with semiconductors as photocatalysts. The most important characteristics of water splitting are its durability and efficiency. Furthermore, TiO2 and 3C–SiC are durable photocatalysts. Because of their different band gaps and conductivity types, a tandem structure combined with these materials functions as an efficient and durable solar water splitting system. It was observed that the photocurrent from the tandem structure was higher at low pH, as noted by the pH dependence of the photocurrent at the TiO2 photoanode. The photocurrent from the tandem structure had a light intensity dependence similar to the photocurrent from the TiO2 photoanode. Therefore, the performance of the tandem structure appears to be limited by the photocurrents from the TiO2 photoanode. We obtained a maximum applied bias photon-to-current conversion efficiency of approximately 0.74% from the tandem structure with no additional bias applied. We also confirmed the presence of a stable photocurrent from the tandem structure for over ~100 days.

Abstract: Long-term thermal energy storage balances the seasonal variations in renewable energy supply and demand, but applied storage concepts require improved performance in efficiency, reliability and capacity. In principle, supercooling and cold-crystallization offer a way to store heat for an extensive amount of time. In this approach, crystallization behaviour of the material governs the storage performance, as it directly relates to optimal efficiency, length of the storage period and heat release properties. This work explains the unique cold-crystallization behaviour of erythritol in cross-linked sodium polyacrylate. To this end, isothermal cold-crystallization was measured experimentally and analysed with the Avrami equation. Although the cold-crystallization rate constant follows the Arrhenius equation, it drastically decreases near the glass transition region and diverges from the equation. Thermal history also influences the cold-crystallization behaviour. Increases in cooling end-temperature reduce the subsequent crystallization time and promote metastable polymorph formation. These findings stem from the peculiar energy landscape of erythritol in cross-linked sodium polyacrylate. The landscape is classified as kinetically strong and thermodynamically fragile, which facilitates long-term thermal energy storage. Consistent supercooling and cold-crystallization behaviour of the material enables predicting the time-dependent crystallization rate at different temperatures. This confirms applicability of the two-stage Arrhenius-VFT model for temperature dependence and supports storage design in real-life applications.

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluation on the long-term reliability of PV backsheets depends largely on the estimation of ultraviolet (UV) damage from the ground reflection; however, current use of total UV irradiance can hardly provide precise estimation due to the spectral UV albedo of grounding materials and spectral sensitivity of backsheet degradation. In this work, effects of spectral UV albedo on the estimation of UV damage were evaluated theoretically through the combinations of 35 types of grounding materials and 4 types of common backsheet materials, including polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (PC) and polyamide (PA). The results showed that, without considering the spectral reflectivity, overestimation of the UV damage for PV backsheets can happen. This work can provide the critical basis for developing more precise lifetime prediction model and designing more reliable accelerated aging tests.

Abstract: A new approach to deposit graded solar selective absorbers (SSA) is proposed. High entropy composite SSAs with antireflection layers have been prepared by non-equilibrium reactive RF magnetron sputtering. In order to obtain the gradient composition a relaxation process of target poisoning in the reactive O2/Ar atmosphere is employed. After introduction of oxygen the target gradually poisoned, resulting in a smooth change of the absorber composition from pure metals to their oxides. The poisoning relaxation time controls the thickness of SSA and the profile distribution of elements, and can be adjusted by selecting the reactive gas flow rate and RF power. Cintered Al:Cr:Nb:Si:Ta:Ti:Y mixture of powders is used as a target material. The graded SSAs demonstrate encouraging results: a coating with maximal selectivity of 13.4 has the solar absorptivity of 0.884 and emissivity of 0.066. In order to test the deposition method, we also try another target materials (AlTi and AlSc), which show better optical properties with the absorptivity of 0.949 (0.978 for textured surface) and selectivity of 18.6. The non-equilibrium reactive sputtering method proposed in this study has the advantages of simplicity and high production yield compared with the existing methods to deposit effective SSAs including double absorbing layer and multilayer coatings.

Abstract: Evidence shows that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) modulate mRNAs of multiple genes by post-transcriptional regulation. However, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, lncRNAs involvement in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs have been rarely reported. In this study, we investigated a novel mechanism of linc01305 promoting metastasis and proliferation of ESCC. The results for real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that linc01305 was highly expressed and predominantly located in cytoplasm of human esophageal cancer cells. Transwell and colony formation assays confirmed that linc01305 promoted migration and proliferation of esophageal cancer cells. RNA-seq, linc01305 pulldown, mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation and mRNA stability assays demonstrated that linc01305 stabilized mRNA of target gene HTR3A through interacting with IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3. Taken together, our data unveils a novel mechanism in which cytoplasmic linc01305 stabilizes HTR3A mRNA through interacting with IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 and thereby promotes metastasis and proliferation of ESCC.

Abstract: Direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) is used to fabricate large-area, periodic surface patterns on Sb2S3 substrates to enhance the performance of solar cells. Comparing the power conversion efficiencies (PCE) to the reference cell on flat Sb2S3 film, a relative increase of 73% is observed for the DLIP patterned device. Our systematic study reveals that DLIP promotes beneficial crystallization of the Sb2S3 film. Light scattering is increased and recombination is depressed in the textured Sb2S3 film. It is expected that our study can provide a roadmap for the further development of photovoltaic devices (PVs) based on chalcogenide semiconductors.

Abstract: Nanostructured electrochromic polymer (ECP) materials are commonly explored in electrochromic devices (ECDs) because of their fast switching speed, high coloration efficiency and long cycle life. However, the preparation of nanostructured ECP films with a single component is still a great challenge. Herein, we present a facile, efficient, low-cost strategy to construct three-dimensional reticular macroporous (3DRM) ECP films without using templates. Polyterthiophene (PTTh) is selected as the model polymer due to its good EC behaviour. The 3DRM PTTh films on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass are fabricated by potentiostatic deposition (PSD) and pulsed electrodeposition (PED) of terthiophene (TTh), and further assembled into the ECDs. We investigate the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of PTTh films, and EC performance of corresponding ECDs. The results indicate that the PTTh film with a PED time of 240 s (PTTh-PED-240) possesses loose 3DRM morphology and large surface area. The EC properties of corresponding ECD is significantly enhanced, exhibiting a large optical contrast, high coloration efficiency, short switching time, and improved cycling. Compared with the ECD based on PTTh film with a PSD time of 120 s on ITO glass (PTTh-PSD-120/ITO), the optical contrast of ECD based on PTTh-PED-240/ITO (ECD-240) increases by 45% (31 → 45%), and its coloration efficiency increases by 107% (258 → 534 cm2/C). This study suggests that PED might be a facile strategy for fabricating high-performance nanostructured ECP films, and its preparation process is low-cost, easily conducted under ambient conditions, showing great potential applications in nanostructured polymer-based ECDs.

Abstract: Solar thermoelectric generators (STEGs), which convert solar thermal energy into electricity, are studied as an environmentally friendly energy source. The unique properties of aerogels (i.e., high thermal insulation and solar light transmission) are essential factors in the solar-receiving components of STEGs. Herein, STEG power generation is enhanced through optical and thermal management using a highly transparent aerogel window. The aerogel window (thickness: 5 mm) exhibits an extremely low thermal conductivity and a high solar transmittance of 96.5%, higher than that of soda-lime glass (89.9% at 0.5 mm thickness) in the wavelength range of 300–2500 nm. Furthermore, we use a copper oxide (CuO) nanoflake structure as a cost-effective solar absorber for the STEG. Under 1-sun (1 k W m−2) illumination, power generation of the STEG with the aerogel window is 21% and 17% higher than that of glass-covered and uncovered STEGs, respectively. To demonstrate the performance of aerogel in an open environment, we measure the power generation of aerogel-covered, glass-covered, and uncovered STEGs under wind conditions. Under 1-sun illumination and a wind speed of 3 m s−1, the power generation of the STEG with the aerogel window is 54% and 71% higher than that of glass-covered and uncovered STEGs, respectively.

Abstract: An in situ Modulated Photoluminescence (MPL) measurement setup mounted on a Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) reactor is described. A method for deriving the actual minority carrier lifetime at the specific injection level of 1.1015 cm−3 is presented. This tool was used in a case study to monitor the passivation properties of aluminum oxide (AlOx) thin films upon annealing. Interesting kinetics, such as a drop of lifetime at temperatures higher than 250 °C along with a recovery of the lifetime during the cooling phase, are shown. Moreover, these in situ results combined with ex situ studies allowed us to demonstrate the formation a stable high positive fixed charge density in the AlOx layer (+1.1012 cm−2) as a consequence of the combination of annealing and light exposure.

Abstract: Monovalent lithium ion has been successfully employed in quasi-solid-state electrochromic devices (ECDs), but it still needs to be optimized in terms of cost, life stability and so on. Herein, a novel electrolyte containing multivalent Aluminum ion (Al3+) was introduced into the ECDs and compared with Lithium ion ECDs. With acrylate-based UV curable glue as the gel electrolyte curing adhesive, WO3 and NiOx films as the complementary counter electrode layers, Li+ (ECD-1), Al3+ (ECD-2) and Al3+/Li+ double ion (ECD-3) as the electrolyte ions, three types of quasi-solid-state ECDs were prepared as Glass/ITO/WO3/polymer electrolyte/NiOx/ITO/Glass. The results showed that the optical modulation amplitude ΔT of three devices is 54.3%, 51.6%, and 53.2%, respectively, while the coloring efficiency (CE) is 62.2, 64.6, and 62.2 cm2/C. The cycle stability test results displayed that during 2000 CA cycles (lasting for 40,000 s, 20 s for one cycle), the optical modulation amplitude ΔT of the Al3+/Li+ devices only decays 16%, which has the excellent cycle durability compared with Li+ devices. This article is an effective attempt to expand the quasi-solid-state electrochromic electrolyte with multivalent ions species, which can broaden the application range of the devices.

Abstract: Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a high incidence cancer and leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. The advances in genomics and transcriptomics in the past decades have improved the detection and prevention of CRC in familial CRC syndromes. Nevertheless, the ultimate goal of personalized medicine for sporadic CRC is still not within reach due no less to the difficulty in integrating population disparity and clinical data to combat what essentially is a very heterogenous disease. This minireview highlights the achievement of the past decades and present possible direction in the hope of early detection and metastasis prevention for reducing CRC-associated morbidity and mortality.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation remains a serious complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) occurring in approximately 60–70% of CMV-seropositive HCT recipients. CMV reactivation leads to adverse outcomes including end-organ damage, graft-versus-host disease, and graft failure.
Methods
Ganciclovir was administered pretransplant at 5 mg/kg twice daily intravenously from the start of conditioning to Day T-2 to CMV-seropositive patients receiving their first allogeneic HCT. CMV DNA was monitored weekly until at least Day 100 posttransplant.
Results
A total of 109 consecutive patients were treated, median age 57 (range 20–73) years. Of these, 36 (33%) patients had a CMV reactivation within the first 105 days posttransplant with a median time of reactivation of 52.5 (range 36–104) days posttransplant. The cumulative incidence of CMV reactivation at Day 105 posttransplant was 33.1% (95% confidence interval: 24.4–42.0). One patient developed CMV disease.
Conclusion
The use of pretransplant ganciclovir was associated with low incidence of CMV reactivation and disease. These data suggest that pretransplant ganciclovir with preemptive therapy for viral reactivation may be a useful strategy to reduce CMV reactivation. Future prospective trials are needed to compare strategies for CMV prophylaxis.

Abstract: Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been detected in several types of cancer, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but lncRNA mapped on transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are little explored. The T-UCRs uc.112, uc.122, uc.160 and uc.262 were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR in bone marrow samples from children with T-ALL (n=32) and common-ALL/pre-B ALL (n=30). In pediatric ALL, higher expression levels of uc.112 were found in patients with T-ALL, compared to patients with B-ALL. T-cells did not differ significantly from B-cells regarding uc.112 expression in non-tumor precursors from public data. Additionally, among B-ALL patients, uc.112 was also found to be increased in patients with hyperdiploidy, compared to other karyotype results. The uc.122, uc.160, and uc.262 were not associated with biological or clinical features. These findings suggest a potential role of uc.112 in pediatric ALL and emphasize the need for further investigation of T-UCR in pediatric ALL.

Abstract: The casting method is a low-cost technique to fabricate photovoltaic monocrystalline silicon wafers. The development of cast monocrystalline silicon (CM-Si) materials requires high quality and low cost. To further reduce CM-Si's cost, a large-scale recycled seed has become a focused topic. This work compared new seeds and a large-scale recycled seed in the same growth so that the experimental errors in the growth environment were eliminated. Detailed characterizations on defect distribution and performances have shown that seed recycling will generate extra initial defects. However, it becomes influential for solar cell performance only when defect concentration reaches a certain level. Finally, a related defect propagation mechanism was revealed for manufacturers to optimize industrial growth strategies.

Abstract: The present work encompasses comparative analysis using numerical optimization for energetic and exergetic efficiencies of solar air heater having Winglet type roughness over the absorber surface.Therefore, it is very necessary to calculate effective as well as exergetic efficiencƴ for the proper estimation of energy utilization of solar air heater. The evaluation of these efficiencies is done by considering parametric design parameter and temperature rise parameters. A mathematical model based on the thermal, effective and exergy analysis for the solar air heater, is presented and its effect on the entire design parameter is examined. Using roughnesѕ parameter e.g. the relative roughness pitch of 8, angle of attack of 600, relative roughness width of 5 at the temperature rise parameter of 0.0125 m2K/W shows maximum enhancement of thermal, effective and exergetic efficiencies comprise of 2.12, 1.99 and 2.03 times over smooth plate. This comprehensive analysis can be very efficient and beneficial to get the design plot for the defined value of roughness parameter without advancing plenteous investment for really conducted experimentation and also providing the performance assessment of the solar air heater design.

Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks of perovskite photovoltaic modules fabrication is the homogeneous deposition of perovskite material on large-area substrates. Here, we show that slot-die coating technique combined with synergistic gas quenching and substrate heating can produce compact, homogenous and reproducible Cs0.16FA0.84Pb(I0·88Br0.12)3 perovskite films. We demonstrate the fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in a planar (n-i-p) device configuration and attain power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18% over 0.09 cm2 device active area. The versatility of this crystallization strategy, which eliminates the need for complex solvents or additive engineering, was studied using planar SnO2- and TiO2-coated FTO substrates. Our study provides greater insights into achieving controlled coating and homogeneous crystallization of perovskite films over large-area substrates (~10 × 10 cm2) necessary for the commercialization of this technology.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been considered as promising applicants, to address the existing energy crisis, for solar energy conversion and photocatalytic water splitting. Here as efficient photocatalysts for water splitting under a wide spectrum from near-infrared, visible to ultraviolet radiation, chromium pristine and Janus monolayers are proposed. A comprehensive investigation of electronic and optical properties of CrS2, CrSe2 and CrTe2 pristine dichalcogenide, CrSSe, CrSTe and CrSeTe Janus monolayers under biaxial strain and electric field using ab-initio method are presented. Binding energy, phonon spectrum and elastic constants illustrate their high dynamic and mechanical stability. The hybrid functional (HSE06) is employed to accurately assess the electronic properties of all monolayers. Band alignment investigation using empirical and DFT methods have revealed that CrSe2 and all Janus monolayers are potential candidates for photocatalytic overall splitting of water. All dichalcogenides and Janus structures have high optical absorption coefficients (~1.0–1.4 ×105 cm−1) which lies from infrared to UV region. Furthermore, it is also observed that due to increase in applied strain, the bandgaps almost decrease linearly. Conversely, there is no significant influence of external electrical field on pristine and Janus dichalcogenides except CrSTe and CrSeTe monolayers. While, strong absorption intensity is slightly increased and move towards high energy in ultraviolet region. Present work not just only highlights the photocatalytic efficiency of pristine CrA2 (A=S, Se, Te) and Janus CrAB (A/B= S, Se, and Te, A≠ B) monolayers but also offers an approach to tune the electronic and optical properties by strain and external electrical field engineering.

Abstract: With the rapid increase of photovoltaic (PV) system production and installation, the recycling of end-of-life PV modules has become a grave issue. In this paper, a new method of microwave-enhanced EVA film swelling and separation for PV panels recycling was innovatively proposed. The results showed that the separation speed of different layers in microwave can be significantly accelerated. Different swelling agents were compared and trichloroethylene was proved to be the most effective. The analysis of dielectric loss and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of different layers indicated that the good absorbing property of antireflection layer and the difference of TEC accelerate the swelling separation. Different conditions such as temperature and liquid-solid ratio were also carried out to optimized separation. The mechanism of microwave enhanced EVA swelling has been analyzed by thermogravimetry and infrared analysis. This study has a good guiding significance for the green and efficient recycling of PV panels.

Abstract: Improving the light-to-thermal conversion properties of phase change materials (PCMs) is conducive to the development of their applications in solar thermal energy storage systems. In this work, a porous structure of expanded graphite (EG) modified Ni-MOF was synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis, and scattered in CH3COONa‧3H2O (SAT) by a physical blending and impregnation method to obtain a novel composite phase change material with reinforce light-to-thermal conversion. The resulting composite PCM showed that the latent heat of composite PCM was 166.6J/g, the supercooling temperature was reduced to 2.5 °C. The porous network structure formed by the close combination of EG and MOF effectively enhanced the heat transfer rate of composite PCM. The thermal conductivity of composite PCM was about 3.21 times that of pure SAT. Furthermore, the composite PCM showed good thermal cycling performance and excellent light-to-thermal conversion properties, which could be suggested as a promising candidate for solar thermal storage systems.

Abstract: Conventional chemotherapy relies on the cytotoxicity of chemo-drugs to inflict destructive effects on tumor cells. However, as most tumor cells develop resistance to chemo-drugs, small doses of chemo-drugs are unlikely to provide significant clinical benefits in cancer treatment while high doses of chemo-drugs have been shown to impact normal human cells negatively due to the non-specific nature and cytotoxicity associated with chemo-drugs. To overcome this challenge, sensitizations of tumor cells with bioactive molecules that specifically target the pro-survival and pro-apoptosis signaling pathways of the tumor cells are likely to increase the therapeutic impacts and improve the clinical outcomes by reducing the dependency and adverse effects associated with using high doses of chemo-drugs in cancer treatment. This review focuses on emerging strategies to enhance the sensitization of tumor cells toward cancer therapies based on our understanding of tumor cell biology and underlying signaling pathways.

Abstract: Solar heating (SH) and Radiative sky cooling (RSC) have been recognized as remarkable renewable energy technologies due to their great energy-saving potential. Recently, the combination of SH and RSC (i.e., SH-RSC) has been proposed and developed since the SH-RSC hybrid utilization can harness heat and cold from the sun and universe directly using a single system. At present, polyethylene (PE) film has been widely used in the SH-RSC system as the wind cover, but it is flimsy and easy to age. Here, we demonstrate a rigid spectral selective cover for the SH-RSC system. The cover consists of bulk zinc sulfide (ZnS) and ZnS/ytterbium fluoride (YbF3) anti-reflective multilayer coatings on both sides of the bulk ZnS. Spectral characterization shows that the fabricated ZnS-based cover has high transmissivity of 0.86 and 0.89 within the solar radiation band and the atmospheric window, respectively. Moreover, with the rigid ZnS cover, the gap between the cover and the absorber can be achieved to be vacuum condition to maximally reduce the intrinsic energy loss and improve the performance of the SH-RSC system. The thermal analysis demonstrates that the ZnS cover-based vacuum SH-RSC system shows a thermal efficiency of 43.9% at a temperature of 80 °C in SH mode and a maximum temperature reduction of 26 °C in RSC mode, which are 17.9% higher and 10.5 °C lower than that of the typical PE cover-based system, respectively. In summary, this ZnS cover provides a choice for enhancing the performance of the hybrid utilization of daytime SH and nighttime RSC processes.

Abstract: High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is a major risk factor for the initiation and progression of cervical cancer (CC). This study aimed to explore the role of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) in HPV-positive CC and the molecules implicated. Differentially expressed genes between HPV-positive and HPV-negative tissues, and differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in cells after HDAC6 downregulation were identified using microarray analyses. The expression profiles of HDAC6 and miR-199a and their cellular functions were investigated via loss-of-function studies. Xenograft tumors were induced in mice for in vivo studies. HDAC6 and Wnt5a were highly expressed, whereas miR-199a was poorly expressed in HPV-positive CC tissues. Downregulation of HDAC6 reduced proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis of HPV-positive CC cells. HDAC6 suppressed the transcription of miR-199a, and miR-199a targeted Wnt5a to inactivate the Wnt signaling pathway. Further downregulation of miR-199a blocked the inhibitory effect of HDAC6 silencing on CC cell growth both in vivo and in vitro, whereas further artificial inhibition of Wnt5a inactivated Wnt signaling and blocked the malignant behaviors of CC cells. This study showed that HDAC6 suppresses the transcription of miR-199a and enhances the progression of HPV-positive cervical cancer through upregulation of Wnt5a.

Abstract: In clinical treatment, there is increasingly prevalent that traditional Chinese medicine treats common bone diseases including osteoporosis. Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), one of the essential compounds of Safflower, has been used as the therapy for thrombus, myocardial ischemia, and inflammation, but its effect on osteogenesis through epigenetic control and ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo has not been explored. Therefore, the study aimed to explore the function and mechanism of HSYA on bone formation and development. We found HSYA could enhance the cell viability and promote osteogenesis of hBMSCs in vitro. Mechanistically, HSYA could increase the expression of β-catenin leading to its accumulation in the nucleus and activation of downstream targets to promote osteogenesis. Besides, RNA-seq and quantitative RT-PCR and western blot showed KDM7A was significantly increased by HSYA. The occupancy of H3K27me2 on β-catenin promoter was significantly decreased by HSYA, which could be reversed by silencing endogenous KDM7A. More importantly, HSYA promoted bone development in chick embryos and prevented ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss in SD rats. Taken together, our study has shown convincing evidence that HSYA could promote osteogenesis and bone development via epigenetically regulating β-catenin and prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss.

Abstract: The use of magnetron sputtering for deposition of the metal electrode in perovskite solar cells has been limited because of the damage to the organic hole transport layer by high kinetic energy particles during the sputtering process. In this paper, a systematic investigation into the effect of sputtering power, argon flow rate, sputtering duration, and argon pressure on the performance of the perovskite cells was conducted. The results of this work show that high power conversion efficiency of 18.35% was obtained for solution-processed, air-fabricated perovskite solar cells with Ag contact prepared using magnetron sputtering. The devices also exhibit an excellent short-current density of 22.56 mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage of 1.10 V and a fill factor of 73.7%. The investigation reveals that sputtering power is the most critical factor that needs to be carefully controlled to minimise the damage to the hole transport layer. This study demonstrates that highly efficient perovskite solar cells can be fabricated using magnetron sputtering if the sputtering parameters are optimised.

Abstract: Introduction
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal hematological diseases. In addition to defects in hematologic progenitor and stem cells, dysfunctions in the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) participate in the MDS pathogenesis. Furthermore, the immune response is deregulated by the pro-inflammatory response prevailing in low-risk MDS, while immunosuppression predominates in high-risk MDS. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), part of the BMM, are characterized by plastic adherent growth and multipotentiality. They exhibit immunomodulatory properties and sustain hematopoiesis. There is conflicting evidence regarding their status in MDS. The aim of this study was to characterize MDS-MSC and evaluate the effect of 5-Azacytidine.
Methods
The MSC from MDS patients and controls were cultured and characterized according to the International Society of Cell Therapy recommendations. Immunomodulatory properties were assessed by studying the MSD cytokine production, using the cytometric bead array. We evaluated the effect of 5-Azacytidine on the MSC cytokine production.
Results
We included 35 MDS patients and 22 controls. The MSC from patients and controls were cultured and characterized. The MSC from patients showed morphological differences, but there were no differences in immunophenotype or multipotentiality. The interleukin 6 (IL-6) was the main MSC secreted cytokine. The MDS-MSC produced higher levels of IL-6, IL-17, interferon gamma, or interferon γ (INF-γ), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The in vitro 5-Azacytidine treatment induced a significant decrease in the IL-6 production by MDS-MSC.
Conclusions
The MDS-MSC show an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The in vitro treatment with 5-Azacytidine lead to a significant reduction in the IL-6 production by the MDS-MSC, restoring the IL-6 levels to those found in controls. The MSC produced inflammatory cytokines involved in the MDS pathogenesis, representing a potential future therapeutic target. Moreover, 5-Azacytidine may have a stromal effect, modulating the immune response in MDS.

Abstract: Objectives
The aim of this systematic review is to investigate different diagnostic methods and the available treatment options for subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL).
Methods
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, EBSCO, and CINAHL Plus for published case reports of SPTCL. From each record, we extracted data of the diagnostic methods, immunohistochemical profile, clinical characteristics, and the treatment approaches provided. Data were summarized and narratively synthesized to highlight the various diagnostic methods and treatment options of SPTCL.
Results
Our literature search yielded 1293 unique citations. Following screening, nine articles reporting a total of 15 cases were included in this systematic review. All patients presented with subcutaneous nodules. Three of the 15 cases were initially misdiagnosed. The atypical lymphoid cells were positive for CD2, CD3, granzyme B, and TIA-1 and negative for CD1a, EBER, and CD20 in all the reported cases. The atypical lymphoid cells were positive for CD45RO in four out of seven cases, positive for CD56 in three out of 12 cases tested, while positive for CD5 and CD8 in the majority of cases. Therapy ranged from topical agents to immunosuppressive agents all the way to multiagent chemotherapy.
Conclusion
SPTCL is a rare lymphoma. Diagnosis is highly dependent on the immunohistochemical stains added to histopathologic and radiologic findings. Therapy is dependent on the pace of the disease, with encouraging results obtained with single-agent cyclosporine.

Abstract: The influence of the cycling temperature, up to 80 °C and down to −10 °C, on the performances of the electrochromic device ITO/NiO/electrolyte/WO3/ITO (NiO//WO3) and symmetrical devices ITO/LixWO3 (colored)/electrolyte/WO3 (bleached)/ITO (WO3//WO3), ITO/LiyNiO (colored)/electrolyte/NiO (bleached)/ITO (NiO//NiO) is studied. At 60 °C, the charge capacity of NiO//WO3 device increases from 2.59 mC/cm2 to 3.22 mC/cm2 compared with that at room temperature, and the chromaticity difference between colored and bleached state could reach ~36. When working at 80 °C, although the charge capacity of the device reaches 4.20 mC/cm2, the poor reversibility of the reaction of the NiO layer results in the irreversible attenuation of the device performance. Interestingly, after degradation associated with cycling at low temperature (56% capacity decrease at −10 °C), a recovery of the electrochromic properties at room temperature is observed. It can be considered that the low temperature within −10 °C basically has no non-recoverable damage to the devices. During the bleaching and coloring process, NiO layer mainly presents pseudocapacitance, while WO3 layer exhibits the ion diffusion control behavior (i.e, (de)insertion mechanism). A comparison with symmetrical devices, WO3//WO3 and NiO//NiO points out that performance change of complementary device NiO//WO3 is mainly affected by the cathodically colored electrochromic layer WO3.
