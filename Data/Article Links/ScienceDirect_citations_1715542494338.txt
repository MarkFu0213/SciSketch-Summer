Abstract: Summary
Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into pancreatic β cells holds great promise for the treatment of diabetes. Recent advances have led to the production of glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cells in vitro, but resulting cells remain less mature than their adult primary β cell counterparts. The barrier(s) to in vitro β cell maturation are unclear. Here, we evaluated a potential role for microRNAs. MicroRNA profiling showed high expression of let-7 family microRNAs in vivo, but not in in vitro differentiated β cells. Reduced levels of let-7 in vitro were associated with increased levels of the RNA binding protein LIN28B, a negative regulator of let-7 biogenesis. Ablation of LIN28B during human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation toward β cells led to a more mature glucose-stimulated insulin secretion profile and the suppression of juvenile-specific genes. However, let-7 overexpression had little effect. These results uncover LIN28B as a modulator of β cell maturation in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
In certain plant hybrids, immunity signaling is initiated when immune components interact in the absence of a pathogen trigger. In Arabidopsis thaliana, such autoimmunity and cell death are linked to variants of the NLR RPP7 and the RPW8 proteins involved in broad-spectrum resistance. We uncover the molecular basis for this autoimmunity and demonstrate that a homolog of RPW8, HR4Fei-0, can trigger the assembly of a higher-order RPP7 complex, with autoimmunity signaling as a consequence. HR4Fei-0-mediated RPP7 oligomerization occurs via the RPP7 C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and ATP-binding P-loop. RPP7 forms a higher-order complex only in the presence of HR4Fei-0 and not with the standard HR4 variant, which is distinguished from HR4Fei-0 by length variation in C-terminal repeats. Additionally, HR4Fei-0 can independently form self-oligomers, which directly kill cells in an RPP7-independent manner. Our work provides evidence for a plant resistosome complex and the mechanisms by which RPW8/HR proteins trigger cell death.

Abstract: Schwann cells, a crucial element in peripheral nervous system, play important roles after peripheral nerve injury. In recent years, the role of miR-485-5p has been discovered in neurological diseases. However, the involvement of miR-485-5p and peripheral nerve injury remains unknown. Mice were subjected to sciatic nerve crush to mimic peripheral nerve injury and the expression of miR-485-5p was detected in sciatic nerve stumps by real-time PCR. BrdU assay was used to analyze the proliferation of Schwann cells after transfection with miR-485-5p mimic and miR-485-5p inhibitor. The effect of miR-485-5p on Schwann cell myelination was determined by evaluating levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced myelin-associated proteins, including Krox20 and MBP, as well as the coculture of Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via immunostaining with anti-MBP antibodies. The regulation mechanism of miR-485-5p was measured by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, and real-time PCR and Western blot. We found miR-485-5p expression was downregulated post nerve injury. miR-485-5p mimic significantly suppressed the proliferation and cAMP-induced expression levels of Krox20 and MBP in Schwann cells. Conversely, miR-485-5p inhibitor promoted these changes in Schwann cells. Also, miR-485-5p inhibitor elevated MBP-positive myelinated fibers. Cdc42 and Rac1 are targets of miR-485-5p in Schwann cells. Downregulation of cdc42 reversed the effect of miR-485-5p inhibitor on the proliferation of Schwann cells. And reducing Rac1 expression attenuated the effect of miR-485-5p silencing on Schwann cell myelination. In conclusion, this study indicated that miR-485-5p suppressed the proliferation and myelination of Schwann cells via targeting cdc42 and Rac1. Which may provide a novel method for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicular long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to influence recipient cells is emerging as a novel mechanism for disease progression. TC0101441 is a newly identified metastasis-related lncRNA involved in cancer. Since endometriosis exhibits prometastasis behavior similar to those observed in cancer, we aimed to investigate whether TC0101441 is involved in endometriosis and, if so, whether extracellular vesicular TC0101441 contributes to the migration/invasion of endometriotic cyst stromal cells (ECSCs). Clinically, we found that TC0101441 was highly expressed in ectopic endometria than in the eutopic and normal endometria. Serum extracellular vesicular TC0101441 levels were substantially increased in patients at stage III/IV endometriosis in comparison with stage I/II endometriosis and controls. In vitro, using TC0101441-high-expression ECSCs (ECSCs-H) as extracellular vesicles (EVs)-generating cells and TC0101441-low-expression ECSCs (ECSCs-L) as recipient cells, we observed that the PKH67-labeled ECSCs-H-derived EVs were effectively internalized by ECSCs-L. ECSCs-H-derived EVs shuttling TC0101441 were transferred to ECSCs-L, modulating their migratory/invasive abilities partially by regulating certain metastasis-related proteins, which eventually facilitated endometriosis migration/invasion. This study elucidates a potential crosstalk between ECSCs via EVs in endometriotic milieus, suggests a novel mechanism for endometriosis migration/invasion from the perspective of the “extracellular vesicular transfer of lncRNAs” and highlights the potential of circulating extracellular vesicular TC0101441 as a biomarker for endometriosis.

Abstract: The a3 isoform of vacuolar-type proton-pumping ATPase (V-ATPase) is essential for bone resorption by osteoclasts. Although more than 90 mutations of the human a3 gene have been identified in patients with infantile malignant osteopetrosis, it is unclear whether they lead to osteoclast dysfunction. We have established an in vitro assay to induce osteoclasts from spleen macrophages derived from a3-knockout mice. Here, we examined the effects of these mutations in a3-knockout osteoclasts. We were interested in four mutations, two short deletions and two missense mutations, previously identified in the a3 cytosolic domain. a3 harboring either of the two short deletions was hardly expressed in osteoclasts and calcium phosphate resorption was impaired. On the other hand, osteoclasts expressing a3 with either of the two missense mutations exhibited no defects. Specifically, expression levels of the mutant proteins, V-ATPase assembly, and calcium phosphate resorption activity were similar to those of the wild type. Moreover, these missense mutants interacted with Rab7, a small GTPase that regulates lysosomal trafficking. These results suggest that the short deletions impair a3 expression and thus disrupt V-ATPase subunit assembly essential for bone resorption, while the missense mutations do not cause osteoclast dysfunction without an additional mutation(s) or impair resorption of bone, but not of calcium phosphate.

The long noncoding RNA NKILA protects against myocardial ischaemic injury by enhancing myocardin expression via suppressing the NF-κB signalling pathway,

Abstract: Background
The lncRNA NKILA has been reported to interact with NF-κB and has an important role in various human diseases. However, the role of NKILA in myocardial ischaemic injury is still unknown.
Methods
We established cell and animal models of myocardial ischaemic injury. We confirmed our findings by overexpressing NKILA, silencing myocardin and using an NF-κB pathway inhibitor in a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model of H9c2 cells. An animal model of ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury was established by LAD ligation. Overexpression of NKILA was achieved by adeno-associated virus (AAV) injection through the tail vein. Annexin-V/PI staining and flow cytometric analysis were performed to test cell apoptosis. ELISAs were used to determine the secretion of inflammatory factors. TTC, HE and TUNEL staining were performed to study myocardial pathological injury. qRT-PCR or Western blotting were used to test the expression levels of NKILA, myocardin, the NF-κB pathway and apoptosis-related proteins.
Results
H/R and I/R treatment significantly suppressed the expression of NKILA and activated the NF-κB pathway, resulting in the loss of myocardin. Overexpressing NKILA led to the suppression of the NF-κB pathway and successfully prevented the cell apoptosis and inflammatory responses caused by H/R stimulation in H9c2 cells. Silencing myocardin reversed the protective effect of NKILA and led to severe injury in the H9c2 cells that underwent H/R. Furthermore, the NF-κB pathway inhibitor BAY11-7028 reduced the H/R injury in H9c2 cells with little effect on NKILA expression. Similar results were confirmed in an animal model of myocardial I/R injury and showed that overexpression of NKILA inhibited I/R-triggered myocardial injury in vivo.
Conclusion
NKILA enhanced the expression of myocardin via inhibiting the NF-κB signalling pathway and preventing cell apoptosis and the inflammatory response of cardiomyocytes, thus ameliorating myocardial I/R injury.

Abstract: MicroRNA-501-3p (miR-501-3p) has been reported to play tumor-suppressive roles in different cancers; however, its expression pattern and biological function in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unknown. In this study, we noted downregulation of miR-501-3p in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Functional assays showed that overexpression of miR-501-3p suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, and invasion. Moreover, miR-501-3p overexpression attenuated in vivo tumor growth in a nude mouse model. In terms of the mechanism, RAP1A was identified as a novel target of miR-501-3p. Overexpression of RAP1A strongly attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR-501-3p on the capacity of NSCLC cells for proliferation and motility. In the clinical samples of NSCLC, miR-501-3p levels negatively correlated with RAP1A expression, which was upregulated in NSCLC. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-501-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC by directly targeting RAP1A mRNA and may serve as a theranostic biomarker for patients with NSCLC.

Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major microvascular complication of diabetes that can lead to end-stage renal disease. Podocytes constitute the last barrier of glomerular filtration, whose damage are the direct cause of proteinuria. Dopamine receptors are involved in the regulation of diabetes-induced glomerular hyperfiltration, and only dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) can be amplified in cultured mouse podocytes. However, the exact effect of D1R on diabetic podocytes remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the protective role of D1R activation on diabetic podocytes injury in vivo and vitro as well as its potential mechanism. We observed D1R protective effect respectively in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 1 diabetes (T1D) mice as well as mouse podocytes (MPC5) cultured in high glucose (HG, 40 mM) medium. It showed that D1R and podocyte-associated proteins (Podocin, CD2AP and Nephrin) expression were significantly decreased both in the T1D mice (fed for 8 and 12 weeks) and HG-cultured MPC5 cells, while the NOX-5 expression increased. In T1D mice, the levels of 24-h urine protein, serum creatinine and urinary 8-OHdG were increased in a time-dependent manner, at the same time, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and electron microscope observed the kidney lesion and podocytes injury. In vitro, HG induced podocytes oxidative stress and apoptosis, which could be inhibited by SKF38393 (a D1R agonist) and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, a reactive oxygen species scavenger). Furthermore, there was a decreasing Podocin expression and a significant increasing NOX-5 expression in podocytes transfected with D1R-small interfering RNA (siRNA). More importantly, the expression of phospho-CREB (the PKA downstream transcription factor) was decreased and phospho-p38 MAPK was increased in HG-induced podocytes, which can respectively be activated or blocked by SKF38393, 8-Bromo-CAMP (a PKA activator), NAC, and SB20380 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor). In conclusion, D1R activation can protect diabetic podocytes from apoptosis and oxidative damage, in part through the PKA/NOX-5/p38 MAPK pathway.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration is a progressive ocular disease that is the leading cause of vision loss among elderly. AMD usually is divided into two types: wet and dry AMD, which is linked with inflammation. Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) formation or wet AMD is also associated with oxidative stress. Previously, TSP1 has been shown to have a significant alleviating effect on CNV in TSP1 knockout (TSP1−/−) mice. However, the mechanism by which TSP1 ameliorates CNV remains unclear. Here we report that TSP1 reduces nitric oxide production to prevent cells from forming tubes formation and reduced the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and lipid peroxides (LPO) during oxidative stress. We measured RF/6A cell viability by CCK-8 assay and apoptosis by flow cytometry. RF/6A cell were transfected with TSP1 and STAT3 overexpression, and then the mRNA and protein levels of TSP1 and also the signal pathways were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Migration assays were performed using a transwell system. Co-Immunoprecipitation was used to analyze the binding relationship between CD47 and SHP-2. The results show that overexpression of TSP1 alleviated the damage of oxidative stress to RF/6A cells including increased cell activity and migration, decreased apoptosis and reduced migration compared to the control group. SHP-2 was activated by TSP1 through its receptor CD47 and STAT3 phosphorylation was reduced by activation of SHP-2, thereby blocking STAT3-iNOS pathway and reducing NO concentration in RF/6A cells ultimately protecting them from oxidative stress. Finally, the CNV mice model confirmed that TSP1 overexpression could protect the mice against CNV in vivo, modified the antioxidants levels and decreased the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 under laser irradiation. These results indicate a potential mechanism of TSP1 to slow down formation of CNV in wet AMD, which may bring hope for new treatment strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising platform to model early embryonic developmental processes, to create disease models that can be evaluated by drug screens as well as proof-of-concept experiments for regenerative medicine. However, generation of iPSC-derived hemato-endothelial and hematopoietic progenitor cells for these applications is challenging due to variable and limited cell numbers, which necessitates enormous up-scaling or development of demanding protocols. Here, we unravel the function of key transcriptional regulators SCL, LMO2, GATA2, and ETV2 (SLGE) on early hemato-endothelial specification and establish a fully inducible and stepwise hemato-endothelial forward programming system based on SLGE-regulated overexpression. Regulated induction of SLGE in stable SLGE-iPSC lines drives very efficient generation of large numbers of hemato-endothelial progenitor cells (CD144+/CD73–), which produce hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD45+/CD34+/CD38–/CD45RA−/CD90+/CD49f+) through a gradual process of endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT).

Abstract: Summary
Articular cartilage injury and degeneration causing pain and loss of quality-of-life has become a serious problem for increasingly aged populations. Given the poor self-renewal of adult human chondrocytes, alternative functional cell sources are needed. Direct reprogramming by small molecules potentially offers an oncogene-free and cost-effective approach to generate chondrocytes, but has yet to be investigated. Here, we directly reprogrammed mouse embryonic fibroblasts into PRG4+ chondrocytes using a 3D system with a chemical cocktail, VCRTc (valproic acid, CHIR98014, Repsox, TTNPB, and celecoxib). Using single-cell transcriptomics, we revealed the inhibition of fibroblast features and activation of chondrogenesis pathways in early reprograming, and the intermediate cellular process resembling cartilage development. The in vivo implantation of chemical-induced chondrocytes at defective articular surfaces promoted defect healing and rescued 63.4% of mechanical function loss. Our approach directly converts fibroblasts into functional cartilaginous cells, and also provides insights into potential pharmacological strategies for future cartilage regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Protein ubiquitination plays a key role in the regulation of cellular processes, and misregulation of the ubiquitin system is linked to many diseases. So far, development of tool compounds that target enzymes of the ubiquitin system has been slow and only a few specific inhibitors are available. Here, we report the selection of single-domain antibodies (single-dAbs) based on a human scaffold that recognize the catalytic domain of HOIP, a subunit of the multi-component E3 LUBAC and member of the RBR family of E3 ligases. Some of these dAbs affect ligase activity and provide mechanistic insight into the ubiquitin transfer mechanism of different E2-conjugating enzymes. Furthermore, we show that the co-crystal structure of a HOIP RBR/dAb complex serves as a robust platform for soaking of ligands that target the active site cysteine of HOIP, thereby providing easy access to structure-based ligand design for this important class of E3 ligases.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling via LPA receptors (LPA1 to LPA6) regulates a variety of malignant properties of cancer cells. It is known that endothelial cells promote tumor progression and chemoresistance. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of LPA5 in cellular functions modulated by endothelial cells and anticancer drug in osteosarcoma cells. Human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were maintained in endothelial F2 cell supernatants. After culturing for 3 months, MG63-F2 cells were established. LPAR5 expression level in MG63-F2 cells was significantly elevated, compared with MG-63 cells. The cell motile activity of MG63-F2 cells was markedly higher than that of MG-63 cells. To validate the effects of LPA5 on cell motile activity, LPA5 knockdown cells were generated from MG-63 cells. The cell motile activity of MG-63 cells was inhibited by LPA5 knockdown. The cell survival to cisplatin (CDDP) was reduced in MG-63 cells treated with LPA. In the presence of LPA, the cell survival rate was significantly lower in MG63-F2 cells than MG-63 cells, correlating with LPAR5 expression. LPA5 knockdown cells indicated the high cell survival rate to CDDP. Moreover, LPAR5 expression level was increased in the long-term CDDP treated MG63-C cells. The cell survival to CDDP of MG63-C cells was enhanced by LPA5 knockdown. These results suggest that cellular functions are regulated through LPA5-mediatd signaling induced by endothelial cells and CDDP in MG-63 cells.

Abstract: There is growing evidence to support a role for the ceramide-metabolizing enzyme, glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), in resistance to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents. Whether GCS contributes to oxaliplatin resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) has not yet been determined. We have addressed this potentially important clinical issue by examining GCS function in two panels of oxaliplatin-resistant, isogenic CRC cell lines. Compared to parental cell lines, oxaliplatin-resistant cells have increased expression of GCS protein associated with increased levels of the pro-survival ceramide metabolite, glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Inhibition of GCS expression by RNAi-mediated gene knockdown resulted in a reduction in cellular GlcCer levels, with restored sensitivity to oxaliplatin. Furthermore, oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells displayed lower ceramide levels both basally and after treatment with oxaliplatin, compared to parental cells. GlcCer, formed by GCS-mediated ceramide glycosylation, is the precursor to a complex array of glycosphingolipids. Differences in cellular levels and species of gangliosides, a family of glycosphingolipids, were also seen between parental and oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cells. Increased Akt activation was also observed in oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cell lines, together with increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin. Finally, this study shows that GCS protein levels are greatly increased in human CRC specimens, compared to matched, normal colonic mucosa, and that high levels of UGCG gene expression are significantly associated with decreased disease-free survival in colorectal cancer patients. These findings uncover an important cellular role for GCS in oxaliplatin chemosensitivity and may provide a novel cellular target for augmenting chemotherapeutic drug effectiveness in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)/protein interactions are essential for life. Despite this importance, their global scope and selectivity remains undefined. Here, we describe CATNIP (CoA/AcetylTraNsferase Interaction Profiling), a chemoproteomic platform for the high-throughput analysis of acyl-CoA/protein interactions in endogenous proteomes. First, we apply CATNIP to identify acetyl-CoA-binding proteins through unbiased clustering of competitive dose-response data. Next, we use this method to profile the selectivity of acyl-CoA/protein interactions, leading to the identification of specific acyl-CoA engagement signatures. Finally, we apply systems-level analyses to assess the features of protein networks that may interact with acyl-CoAs, and use a strategy for high-confidence proteomic annotation of acetyl-CoA-binding proteins to identify a site of non-enzymatic acylation in the NAT10 acetyltransferase domain that is likely driven by acyl-CoA binding. Overall, our studies illustrate how chemoproteomics and systems biology can be integrated to understand the roles of acyl-CoA metabolism in biology and disease.

Abstract: α-Mangostin (MAN) is a bioactive compound isolated from the inedible pericarp of a tropical fruit mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana Linn). It exhibits notable therapeutic potentials on lung cancers, but the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. This study was designed to further explore the mechanisms involved in cytotoxicity of MAN on A549 cells. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by flow cytometry methods. The fluorescent probes DCFH-DA and JC-1 were used to assess the intracellular reactive oxidative species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential statuses, respectively. The regulation of MAN on relevant pathways was investigated by immunoblotting assays. The results obtained indicated that MAN caused significant apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in A549 cells, which eventually resulted in inhibition on cell proliferation in vitro. All these phenomena were synchronized with escalated oxidative stress and downregulation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAMPT/NAD). Supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) efficiently eased MAN-induced ROS accumulation, and potently antagonized MAN-elicited apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The pro-apoptotic effect of MAN was further confirmed by increased expressions of cleaved caspase 3, 6, 7, and 9, and its effect on cell cycle progression was validated by the altered expressions of p-p38, p-p53, CDK4, and cyclin D1. The immunoblotting assays also demonstrated that NAC/NMN effectively restored these molecular changes elicited by MAN treatment. Collectively, this study revealed a unique anti-tumor mechanism of MAN by provoking ROS production through downregulation of NAMPT/NAD signaling and further validated MAN as a potential therapeutic reagent for lung cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Gram-negative bacteria release outer membrane vesicles into the external milieu to deliver effector molecules that alter the host and facilitate virulence. Vesicle formation is driven by phospholipid accumulation in the outer membrane and regulated by the phospholipid transporter VacJ/Yrb. We use the facultative human pathogen Vibrio cholerae to show that VacJ/Yrb is silenced early during mammalian infection, which stimulates vesiculation that expedites bacterial surface exchange and adaptation to the host environment. Hypervesiculating strains rapidly alter their bacterial membrane composition and exhibit enhanced intestinal colonization fitness. This adaptation is exemplified by faster accumulation of glycine-modified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and depletion of outer membrane porin OmpT, which confers resistance to host-derived antimicrobial peptides and bile, respectively. The competitive advantage of hypervesiculation is lost upon pre-adaptation to bile and antimicrobial peptides, indicating the importance of these adaptive processes. Thus, bacteria use outer membrane vesiculation to exchange cell surface components, thereby increasing survival during mammalian infection.

Abstract: Glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS) is a classic surgical method used to treat glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness. Scar formation caused by excessive Tenon's capsule fibroblast activation leads to surgical failure. However, the mechanism underlying this activation is largely unknown. In this study, we first isolated primary human Tenon's capsule fibroblasts (HTFs) and found that TGF-β promoted the viability, proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition of HTFs. Then, we showed that TGF-β promoted the expression of H19 in HTFs and that suppression of H19 inhibited the effect of TGF-β on HTFs. Furthermore, we revealed that H19 exerted its effects by interacting with miR-200a in TGF-β-treated HTFs. Additionally, we showed that β-catenin was a target of miR-200a in TGF-β-treated HTFs. We also demonstrated that H19 acted by modulating the H19/miR-200a/β-catenin regulatory axis in TGF-β-treated HTFs. Ultimately, we found that the components of the H19/miR-200a/β-catenin regulatory axis were aberrantly expressed in a rat model of GFS. Our results show that H19 indeed acts by modulating β-catenin expression via miR-200a in TGF-β-treated HTFs, thus providing a novel rationale for the development of H19-based strategies to attenuate scar formation after GFS.

Abstract: Coordinated regulation of autophagy and apoptosis helps to enhance the antitumor effects of sodium selenite. However, the potential molecules that act as switch nodes in the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is still elusive. Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) has been shown to regulate leukocyte differentiation, while its role in autophagy/apoptosis toggle switch remains unexplored. In this study, we showed that sodium selenite switched protective autophagy to apoptosis in p53-wild type NB4 cells without obvious caspase-8/apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) axis activation, while induced autophagy-dependent caspase-8/AIF axis activation in p53-mutant Jurkat cells. Additionally, p53 was demonstrated as a positive regulator of PLSCR1. p53-dependent up-regulation of PLSCR1 accounted for the differential regulation of autophagy and apoptosis induced by sodium selenite. Furthermore, sodium selenite induced the release of AIF from mitochondria to cytosol with the facilitation of caspase-8 in Jurkat cells, while not in NB4 cells. The released AIF further enhanced autophagy flux through interacting with PLSCR1, which hereby resulting in the disassociation of PLSCR1 from Atg5-Atg12 complex. Our results indicate that PLSCR1 plays a critical role in p53-dependent regulation of autophagy and apoptosis in sodium selenite-treated leukemia cells. Manipulation of p53-PLSCR1 cascade might be beneficial to enhance the anti-tumor effects of sodium selenite.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world. Senescence is frequently observed in the progression of pancreatic cancer. In a previous study, we showed that KLF2 inhibited the growth and migration of pancreatic cancer. However, the mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we showed that overexpression of KLF2 induced the senescence of pancreatic cancer cells and inhibited tumorigenesis, and knockdown of KLF2 inhibited senescence and p21 expression. In the molecular mechanism study, KLF2 was found to interact with FOXO4 and cooperated with FOXO4 to induce the expression of p21. Downregulation of p21 and FOXO4 impaired the induction of senescence by KLF2. Overall, this study revealed the functions and mechanisms of KLF2 in senescence and provided a novel explanation for the suppressive roles of KLF2 in pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: BRAF mutations occur in approximately 50% of melanoma patients. The mutated BRAF kinase continuously activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway to promote cell growth and proliferation. Vemurafenib as a specific BRAF inhibitor can significantly prolong progression-free survival in melanoma patients. However, most patients developed resistance to Vemurafenib after 6 months. The mechanism of drug resistance is not yet fully understood. In this study, we found that proteins secreted by drug-resistant cells protect sensitive cells from Vemurafenib. By RNA-seq, we compared differentially expressed genes between resistant and sensitive cells. We demonstrated that drug-resistant cells secrete more IL-6 protein than sensitive cells. For the first time, we found that IL-6 expressed by drug-resistant cells consists of the following transcripts: IL6-201, IL6-202 and IL6-205. We confirmed that it is the IL6-202 and IL6-205 transcripts that confer drug resistance to Vemurafenib by reactivating the MAPK pathway while IL6-201 is not responsible for the resistance in A375 melanoma cells. Neutralizing IL-6 significantly increased the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to Vemurafenib. Overall, these results reveal a new mechanism of drug resistance in melanoma.

Abstract: Chemo-resistance to conventional therapy is a major barrier requiring further investigation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cancer stem like cells (CSCs) contribute to the tumorigenicity, progression, and chemo-resistance of malignancies. Studies have implicated the anti-cancer effects of arsenic trioxide (ATO) and have explored the underlying mechanisms. However, whether ATO might reverse chemo-resistance by inhibiting the CSC like properties remains under investigation. Here, we explored the potential of ATO in chemotherapy in constructed multiple drug resistant (MDR) liver cancer cells. ATO re-sensitized the MDR Bel-7402 cells (BelMDR) cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, an effect mediated by the inhibition of NF-κB pathway and CSCs properties. For the molecular mechanisms, via inducing the DNA de-methylation, ATO activated the microRNA-148a (miR-148a), leading to the repression of NF-κB pathway by targeting the 3′-UTR of p65. In summary, epigenetic regulation of miR-148a by ATO is an important mechanism in drug resistance that decreases the expression of NF-κB and hence represses CSC like phenotype. These findings may suggest a novel mechanism for HCC treatment.

Abstract: PAH is a progressive disease characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of PASMCs. Zinc finger protein A20 is a negative feedback regulatory protein of NF-κB activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate zinc finger protein A20 can alleviate PAH in hypoxia exposed mice. C57BL/6 mice received a tail vein injection of adenovirus-mediated ad-A20 and ad-A20 shRNA were exposed to hypoxia. PASMCs isolated from rat pulmonary arteries were cultured in hypoxia, and were transfection of A20 adenovirus. Pulmonary hemodynamic parameters were measured by right heart catheterization. Pulmonary vascular morphological changes were analyzed by HE and α-SMA staining. The expression changes of A20, NF-κB and its downstream protein were detected. The expression of phospho-p65 was increased with the prolongation of hypoxia time. The expression of A20 in lung tissue of chronic hypoxia group decreased with the prolongation of hypoxia time. Adenovirus-mediated A20 (ad-A20) overexpression significantly attenuated the abnormally increased RVSP, RV/(LV + S) ratio, WT%, WA%, α-SMA and the pulmonary vessel muscularization. Ad-A20 treatment markedly attenuated the degradation of phospho-p65 and inhibited the induction of phospho-IκBα induced by hypoxia treatment. Furthermore, silencing A20 abolished the protection by anti-inflammatory activity and the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. We showed that Zinc finger protein A20 can block NF-κB signaling pathway, alleviates the hypoxia-induced abnormal elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure, hyperproliferation of PASMCs and the pulmonary vascular remodeling.

Abstract: Induction of heat shock protein expression and the heat shock (stress) response are seen in exercise. This exercise-induced response is thought protective against cellular stress through the expression of heat shock proteins. The highly inducible heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) has been shown to be expressed in a number of stress-related conditions, but not investigated in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Twenty-one women (10 controls, 11 with PCOS) concluded an 8-week supervised, moderate-intensity exercise programme. Monocytes and lymphocytes were analysed by flow cytometry for HSP72 expression from blood samples prior to, mid-way and at the completion of the programme. The monocyte HSP72 expression showed an increase from baseline values through mid-way (p = 0.025), and at the completion of the programme (p = 0.011) only in the control group, the PCOS group showed no significant change. This pattern was similar for lymphocyte HSP72 expression where a significant increase was found at the completion of the programme (p = 0.01) only in the control group. The magnitude of increased HSP72 expression following completion of the programme was linked to baseline values only in the control group. In conclusion, increased HSP72 expression to exercise over an 8-week period was seen in control but not in PCOS women, suggesting that there is an impairment of HSP72 expression in response to exercise in these women.

Abstract: Summary
Protein degradation via the use of bivalent chemical degraders provides an alternative strategy to block protein function and assess the biological roles of putative drug targets. This approach capitalizes on the advantages of small-molecule inhibitors while moving beyond the restrictions of traditional pharmacology. Here, we report a chemical degrader (UNC6852) that targets polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). UNC6852 contains an EED226-derived ligand and a ligand for VHL which bind to the WD40 aromatic cage of EED and CRL2VHL, respectively, to induce proteasomal degradation of PRC2 components, EED, EZH2, and SUZ12. Degradation of PRC2 with UNC6852 blocks the histone methyltransferase activity of EZH2, decreasing H3K27me3 levels in HeLa cells and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells containing EZH2 gain-of-function mutations. UNC6852 degrades both wild-type and mutant EZH2, and additionally displays anti-proliferative effects in this cancer model system.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and skeletal stem cells (SSCs) cohabit in the bone marrow. KITL (C-KIT ligand) from LEPR+ adult bone marrow stromal cells is pivotal for HSC maintenance. In contrast, it remains unclear whether KITL/C-KIT signaling also regulates SSCs. Here, we lineage traced C-KIT+ cells and found that C-KIT was expressed by fetal, but not postnatal skeletal progenitors. Fetal C-KIT+ cells gave rise to 20% of LEPR+ stromal cells in adult bone marrow, forming nearly half of all osteoblasts. Disruption of mTOR signaling in fetal C-KIT+ cells impaired bone formation. Notably, conditional deletion of Kitl from PRX1+ fetal bone marrow stromal cells, but not LEPR+ adult bone marrow stromal cells, significantly increased bone formation. Thus, our work identified C-KIT+ skeletal progenitors as an important source of bones formed during development.

Abstract: Summary
Radial glia (RG) cells are the first neural stem cells to appear during embryonic development. Adult human glioblastomas harbor a subpopulation of RG-like cells with typical RG morphology and markers. The cells exhibit the classic and unique mitotic behavior of normal RG in a cell-autonomous manner. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of glioblastoma cells reveal transcriptionally dynamic clusters of RG-like cells that share the profiles of normal human fetal radial glia and that reside in quiescent and cycling states. Functional assays show a role for interleukin in triggering exit from dormancy into active cycling, suggesting a role for inflammation in tumor progression. These data are consistent with the possibility of persistence of RG into adulthood and their involvement in tumor initiation or maintenance. They also provide a putative cellular basis for the persistence of normal developmental programs in adult tumors.

Abstract: The highly conserved heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) contributes to survival at a cellular level and greatly enhances stress tolerance in many organisms. In this study, we isolate and characterize Cshsp702, which encodes an inducible form of HSP70 in the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis. Cshsp702 does not contain introns; the translational product is comprised of 629 amino acids with an isoelectric point of 5.69. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that Cshsp702 was expressed at maximal levels in hemocytes and was minimally expressed in the midgut. Expression of Cshsp702 in response to a range of temperatures (−11 to 43 °C) indicated significant induction by extreme cold and hot temperatures, with maximum expression after 2 h at 42 °C. The induction of Cshsp702 in response to the endoparasite Cotesia chilonis was also studied; interestingly, Cshsp702 expression in C. suppressalis was significantly induced at 24 h and 5 days, which correspond to predicted times of C. chilonis feeding and growth, respectively. The potential induction of Cshsp702 as an inflammatory response due to parasitic stress is discussed. In conclusion, Cshsp702 is induced in response to both environmental and biotic stress and plays an important role in the physiological adaptation of C. suppressalis.

Abstract: Summary
Ciliopathies are heterogeneous genetic diseases affecting primary cilium structure and function. Meckel-Gruber (MKS) and Bardet-Biedl (BBS) syndromes are severe ciliopathies characterized by skeletal and neurodevelopment anomalies, including polydactyly, cognitive impairment, and retinal degeneration. We describe the generation and molecular characterization of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal sheets (RSs) from controls, and MKS (TMEM67) and BBS (BBS10) cases. MKS and BBS RSs displayed significant common alterations in the expression of hundreds of developmental genes and members of the WNT and BMP pathways. Induction of crystallin molecular chaperones was prominent in MKS and BBS RSs suggesting a stress response to misfolded proteins. Unique to MKS photoreceptors was the presence of supernumerary centrioles and cilia, and aggregation of ciliary proteins. Unique to BBS photoreceptors was the accumulation of DNA damage and activation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint. This study reveals how combining cell reprogramming, organogenesis, and next-generation sequencing enables the elucidation of mechanisms involved in human ciliopathies.

Abstract: Summary
The composition of the human microbiome profoundly impacts human well-being. However, the mechanisms underlying microbiome maturation are poorly understood. The nasal microbiome is of particular importance as a source of many respiratory infections. Here, we performed a large sequencing and culture-based analysis of the human nasal microbiota from different age groups. We observed a significant decline of pathogenic bacteria before adulthood, with an increase of the commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis. In seniors, this effect was partially reversed. In vitro, many S. epidermidis isolates stimulated nasal epithelia to produce antimicrobial peptides, killing pathogenic competitors, while S. epidermidis itself proved highly resistant owing to its exceptional capacity to form biofilms. Furthermore, S. epidermidis isolates with high antimicrobial peptide-inducing and biofilm-forming capacities outcompeted pathogenic bacteria during nasal colonization in vivo. Our study identifies a pivotal role of S. epidermidis in healthy maturation of the nasal microbiome, which is achieved at least in part by symbiotic cooperation with innate host defense.

Abstract: FTO, a demethylase for N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, has been implicated in multiple tumors. However, its roles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain uncovered. This study aims to evaluate the clinical relevance and functional roles in this disease. Through immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses, we found FTO expression in ESCC tissues was stronger than that in adjacent normal tissues, and the survival curves displayed high FTO expression had a trend toward poor prognosis. Functionally, silencing of FTO inhibited ESCC cell growth and migration in CCK8, EdU, colony formation and transwell assays and FTO overexpression showed the opposite results. Furthermore, FTO was also required for the tumorigenicity of ESCC cells in nude mice. The data from RNA-seq analysis revealed that MMP13 expression was significantly affected by FTO knockdown. qRT-PCR and Western blot assays confirmed that MMP13 was positively regulated by FTO in both mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, the functional link between FTO and MMP13 was explored by CCK8 and transwell chamber approaches. These findings suggest that FTO is up-regulated and plays oncogenic roles in ESCC. MMP13 may function as a downstream target of FTO.

Abstract: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most important causative agents of hepatitis worldwide. The current study aimed to evaluate the silencing effect of the small interference RNA (siRNA) molecules designed against the core region of HCV genotype 4 (HCV-4) and the CD81 gene, which is the cellular receptor for HCV in the human hepatocytes. RT-PCR was used to measure the changes in both the viral HCV core and the cellular CD81 genes induced by the specific siRNA molecules. Additionally, the fluctuations in either the viral or the cellular proteins of the target regions were tested by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. The results showed the effectiveness of the used siRNA molecules against the target genes in either RNA or protein levels. The effect of 100 nM of siCD81 and 40 nM of siCore was more evident at 24 and 48 h post-transfection. The combination of the two siRNA molecules resulted in an extra inhibitory effect of the HCV core at both the RNA (85.6%) and protein (98.5%) levels. The current study suggested that targeting of the CD81 cellular receptor and/or the viral HCV core region by the small interference molecules might be a suitable choice in the suppression of HCV-4 replication. This might assist the development of new antiviral medications and provides a new alternative strategy for the targeting and treatment of HCV genotype 4.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary fibers (DFs) impact the gut microbiome in ways often considered beneficial. However, it is unknown if precise and predictable manipulations of the gut microbiota, and especially its metabolic activity, can be achieved through DFs with discrete chemical structures. Using a dose-response trial with three type-IV resistant starches (RS4s) in healthy humans, we found that crystalline and phosphate cross-linked starch structures induce divergent and highly specific effects on microbiome composition that are linked to directed shifts in the output of either propionate or butyrate. The dominant RS4-induced effects were remarkably consistent within treatment groups, dose-dependent plateauing at 35 g/day, and can be explained by substrate-specific binding and utilization of the RS4s by bacterial taxa with different pathways for starch metabolism. Overall, these findings support the potential of using discrete DF structures to achieve targeted manipulations of the gut microbiome and its metabolic functions relevant to health.

Abstract: Summary
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a commensal of the human nasopharynx that can also cause severe antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotics drive the spread of resistance by inducing S. pneumoniae competence, in which bacteria express the transformation machinery that facilitates uptake of exogenous DNA and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We performed a high-throughput screen and identified potent inhibitors of S. pneumoniae competence, called COM-blockers. COM-blockers limit competence by inhibiting the proton motive force (PMF), thereby disrupting export of a quorum-sensing peptide that regulates the transformation machinery. Known chemical PMF disruptors and alterations in pH homeostasis similarly inhibit competence. COM-blockers limit transformation of clinical multi-drug-resistant strains and HGT in infected mice. At their active concentrations, COM-blockers do not affect growth, compromise antibiotic activity, or elicit detectable resistance. COM-blockers provide an experimental tool to inhibit competence and other PMF-involved processes and could help reduce the spread of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance in bacteria.

Abstract: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a major threat to health worldwide. Lipotoxicity and macrophage-mediated inflammation play key roles in the pathogenesis of NASH. In this study, we found that individuals with higher serum LDL-C levels have a higher prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and elevated levels of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase. A logistic regression analysis revealed that serum LDL-C level is an independent risk factor for the prevalence and prognosis of NAFLD. In vitro, we used ox-LDL and MβCD-cholesterol to treat Huh7 cells and found that cholesterol loading reduced lysosomal quantity and impaired lysosomal acidification, reducing the number of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) colocalizing with lysosomes. The bafilomycin A1 inhibition of lysosomal function also inhibited lysosomal MVBs degradation, promoting the release of exosomes from the Huh7 cells. Next, we found that cholesterol loading promoted exosome release from the Huh7 cells. The exosomes from the cholesterol-loaded cells increased the ratio of the THP-1 cells positive for the M1 marker (iNOS-1) without affecting the ratio of the cells positive for the M2 marker (CD206). Moreover, an elevated level of miR-122-5p was observed in exosomes derived from the Huh7 cells loaded with cholesterol. While the miR-122-5p mimics promoted THP-1 M1 polarization, downregulating miR-122-5p in the Huh7 cells inhibited the exosome-induced activation of macrophages and macrophage-related inflammation. These findings suggest that cholesterol plays an important role in the development and progression of NASH. Cholesterol-induced lysosomal dysfunction increases exosome release from hepatocytes, resulting in M1 polarization and macrophage-induced inflammation in a miR-122-5p-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) culture has become routine, yet the cost of pluripotent cell media, frequent medium changes, and the reproducibility of differentiation have remained restrictive. Here, we describe the formulation of a hiPSC culture medium (B8) as a result of the exhaustive optimization of medium constituents and concentrations, establishing the necessity and relative contributions of each component to the pluripotent state and cell proliferation. The reagents in B8 represent only 3% of the costs of commercial media, made possible primarily by the in-lab generation of three E. coli-expressed, codon-optimized recombinant proteins: fibroblast growth factor 2, transforming growth factor β3, and neuregulin 1. We demonstrate the derivation and culture of 34 hiPSC lines in B8 as well as the maintenance of pluripotency long term (over 100 passages). This formula also allows a weekend-free feeding schedule without sacrificing capacity for differentiation.

Abstract: Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC) is a relatively rare malignancy and has the worst prognosis among head and neck cancer. Metastasis is the major cause of poor prognosis in HSCC patients. In this study, we found that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1 or PDPK1) was overexpressed in HSCC. The overexpression was positively correlated lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and distant metastasis and indicated poor outcome. Loss and gain-of-function revealed that PDK1 increased cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanically, PDK1 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promoted metastasis by activating the Notch1 signaling pathway. We further illustrated that PDK1 bound with the Notch1 intracellular domain, thereby inhibiting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation in a protein kinase B (Akt-) independent manner. In summary, PDK1/Notch1 axis played an important role in HSCC metastasis, and this investigation provided a new perspective on potential therapeutic targets for HSCC.

Abstract: Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1) is known to be involved in the progression of a variety of human cancers. However, the role of SND1 in cervical cancer remains unclear. Here, we found that the expression of SND1 in cervical cancer tissue was higher than that in normal cervical tissue. Importantly, high SND1 expression was closely associated with tumorigenic phenotype and shorter survival among cervical cancer patients. Functional assays demonstrated that SND1 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion capabilities of cervical cancer cells in vitro. Additionally, a xenograft assay showed that silencing SND1 in cervical cancer cells suppressed lung metastasis in vivo. Further investigation revealed that knockdown of SND1 inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cervical cancer cells by enhancing FOXA2 expression. Moreover, the pro-metastasis effect of SND1 in cervical cancer was at least in part dependent on FOXA2 inhibition. Mechanistically, we found that SND1-induced FOXA2 ubiquitination resulted in degradation, mediated by the E3 ligase enzyme Smurf1. In summary, SND1 plays a crucial role in cervical cancer metastasis, and we provide evidence that SND1 may serve as a prognostic and therapeutic target in cervical cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Robust production of terminally differentiated cells from self-renewing resident stem cells is essential to maintain proper tissue architecture and physiological functions, especially in high-turnover tissues. However, the transcriptional networks that precisely regulate cell transition and differentiation are poorly understood in most tissues. Here, we identified Sox100B, a Drosophila Sox E family transcription factor, as a critical regulator of adult intestinal stem cell differentiation. Sox100B is expressed in stem and progenitor cells and required for differentiation of enteroblast progenitors into absorptive enterocytes. Mechanistically, Sox100B regulates the expression of another critical stem cell differentiation factor, Sox21a. Supporting a direct control of Sox21a by Sox100B, we identified a Sox21a intronic enhancer that is active in all intestinal progenitors and directly regulated by Sox100B. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the activity and regulation of two Sox transcription factors are essential to coordinate stem cell differentiation and proliferation and maintain intestinal tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: The complex scenario of multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology involves several mechanisms, including oxidative stress response. The heat shock proteins (HSPs) are important for the protection of the cells; however, their role in MS is not clear. The present research is focused on the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to oxidative stress and to the involvement of HSP70-2 (a protein coded by the HSPA1B gene, located in the MHC class III). To this aim, we challenged PBMCs from MS patients and healthy controls with hydrogen peroxide. Specifically, PBMCs mitochondrial activity, HSP70-2 protein expression and the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species were assessed. These parameters were also related to the HSP70-2 rs1061581 polymorphism, which is linked to the risk of developing MS. Moreover, mitochondrial activity and HSP70-2 protein levels were also related to disease severity. Overall, our results indicate that PBMCs, from both MS patients and healthy controls, may display a similar response towards an oxidative insult; within this context, HSP70-2 does not seem to be central in the protection of PBMCs. Nevertheless, the HSP70-2 rs1061581 polymorphism is related to ROS levels and appears to have a role in the different expression of HSP70-2 under oxidative stimulus.

Abstract: The interaction between squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a major role in cancer progression. Therefore, understanding the TME is essential for the development of cancer therapies. We used four (primary and metastatic) head and neck (HN) SCC cell lines and cultured them on top of or within 5 matrices (mouse sarcoma-derived Matrigel®, rat collagen, human leiomyoma-derived Myogel, human fibronectin and human fibrin). We performed several assays to study the effects of these matrices on the HNSCC behavior, such as proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as cell morphology, and molecular gene profile. Carcinoma cells exhibited different growth patterns depending on the matrix. While fibrin enhanced the proliferation of all the cell lines, collagen did not. The effects of the matrices on cancer cell migration were cell line dependent. Carcinoma cells in Myogel-collagen invaded faster in scratch wound invasion assay. On the other hand, in the spheroid invasion assay, three out of four cell lines invaded faster in Myogel-fibrin. These matrices significantly affected hundreds of genes and a number of pathways, but the effects were cell line dependent. The matrix type played a major role in HNSCC cell phenotype. The effects of the ECMs were either constant, or cell line dependent. Based on these results, we suggest to select the most suitable matrix, which provides the closest condition to the in vivo TME, in order to get reliable results in in vitro experiments.

Abstract: Summary
WNTs regulate myriad biological processes during embryonic development and are key regulators of stem cell function, tissue homeostasis, and injury repair in adults. The creation of WNT-based therapies has been hampered by challenges in developing soluble, potent, and selective WNT molecules. Soluble WNT surrogates have been reported, but they demonstrate relatively weak WNT signaling activity. Here, we describe a platform for potent, selective WNT surrogate generation. We identify multivalent binding to Frizzleds (FZDs) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRPs) to be a requirement for maximal WNT/β-catenin activation. Furthermore, we show that recruitment of two different FZDs together with LRP causes efficient signaling. Surrogate WNT targeting either FZD1,2,7 or FZD5,8 induces expansive growth of intestinal organoids. This flexible WNT surrogate platform yields potent agonists with any desired receptor specificity and will be useful for research and therapeutic applications for tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Bovine mastitis is a common inflammatory disease caused by various factors. The main factor of mastitis is pathogenic microorganism infection, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus. Cronobacter sakazakii (C. sakazakii) is a newly discovered pathogenic bacteria in milk products, which seriously threat human health in recent years. At present, it has not been reported that the pathogenesis of mastitis is caused by C. sakazakii. This study investigated the inflammation of mammary gland epithelium, which was induced by C. sakazakii for the first time. We focused on bacterial isolation, histological observation, AIM2 inflammasome pathways, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis. The results showed that C. sakazakii–induced inflammation caused damage of tissue, significantly increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), activated the AIM2 inflammasome pathway (increased the expression of AIM2 and cleaved IL-1β), and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (increased the expression of ERdj4, Chop, Grp78) and apoptosis (increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, a marker of apoptosis). In conclusion, it is suggested that it maybe inhibite AIM2 inflammasome pathways and alleviate endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) against the C. sakazakii–induced inflammation.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that serum secretory phospholipase A2 group IB (sPLA2-IB) is associated with proteinuric kidney diseases and plays a pivotal role in podocyte injury via its natural receptor. Arachidonic acid (AA), as a major metabolite of sPLA2-IB, regulates the actin bungling remodeling and contributes to the podocyte injury. However, the underlying mechanism of AA in the regulation of podocyte actin remodeling and human podocyte injury is unclear. Here, we reported that AA induced F-actin cytoskeletal ring formation and promoted protein kinase A (PKA), nephrin and c-Abl phosphorylation. Moreover, AA promoted c-Abl translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and increased the recruitment of c-Abl to p-nephrin by the interaction between them. H89 (PKA inhibitor) provided protection against AA-induced F-actin bunching remodeling, down-regulated nephrin phosphorylation, and suppressed the c-Abl translocation and activation. STI571 (c-Abl inhibitor) also improved the AA associated F-actin bunching remodeling. In addition, H89 and STI571 both alleviated apoptosis and adhesion damage of podocyte. These results indicate that an excess of AA treatment is detrimental to the podocyte actin cytoskeleton and promotes podocyte injury due to the activation of PKA-c-Abl signaling.

Abstract: Lymphedema is a chronic progressive disease ultimately resulting in severe, disfiguring swelling and permanent changes of the affected tissues. Presently, there is no causal treatment approach of lymphedema. Therefore, most therapies are purely symptomatic. However, the recent use of stem cell-based therapies has offered new prospects for alternative treatment options. The present study was performed to investigate the effects of human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) on human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs) in terms of basic in vitro lymphangiogenic assays (WST-8 assay, scratch assay, transmigration assay, sprouting assay, tube formation assay). The influence of ADSC-conditioned medium (ADSC-CM) on HDLECs was compared to recombinant VEGF-C, bFGF and HGF. Further ADSC-CM was characterized by protein microarray and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although key-lymphangiogenic growth factors - like VEGF-C - could only be detected in low concentrations within the conditioned medium (CM), HDLECs were potently stimulated to proliferate, migrate and to form tube like structures by ADSC-CM. Despite concentrations more than hundredfold higher than those found in the conditioned medium, stimulation with recombinant VEGF-C, bFGF and HGF was still weaker compared to ADSC-CM. These results highlight the effectiveness of growth factors secreted by ADSC to stimulate HDLEC, potentially providing a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment of lymphedema.

Abstract: Patients with estrogen receptor α positive (ERα+) breast cancer can respond to endocrine therapy, but treatment resistance is common and associated with downregulation of ERα expression in the dormant residual cells. Here we show, using long-term NSG xenograft models of human breast cancer and primary human monocytes, in vitro primary cell cultures and tumors from breast cancer patients, that macrophage derived tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) downregulates ERα in breast cancer cells via inactivation of the transcription factor Forkhead box O transcription factor 3a (FOXO3a). Moreover, presence of tumor associated macrophages in the primary tumor of breast cancer patients, was associated with ERα negativity, and with worse prognosis in patients with ERα+ tumors. We propose that pro-inflammatory macrophages, despite being tumoricidal, may have direct effects on tumor progression and endocrine resistance in breast cancer patients. Our findings suggest that TNFα antagonists should be evaluated for treatment of ERα+ breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The scarcity of donors and need for immunosuppression limit pancreatic islet transplantation to a few patients with labile type 1 diabetes. Transplantation of encapsulated stem cell-derived islets (SC islets) might extend the applicability of islet transplantation to a larger cohort of patients. Transplantation of conformal-coated islets into a confined well-vascularized site allows long-term diabetes reversal in fully MHC-mismatched diabetic mice without immunosuppression. Here, we demonstrated that human SC islets reaggregated from cryopreserved cells display glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro. Importantly, we showed that conformally coated SC islets displayed comparable in vitro function with unencapsulated SC islets, with conformal coating permitting physiological insulin secretion. Transplantation of SC islets into the gonadal fat pad of diabetic NOD-scid mice revealed that both unencapsulated and conformal-coated SC islets could reverse diabetes and maintain human-level euglycemia for more than 80 days. Overall, these results provide support for further evaluation of safety and efficacy of conformal-coated SC islets in larger species.

Abstract: RALY is a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP), an RNA-binding protein that plays a role in mRNA splicing and metabolism, may be involved in tumorigenesis and development. Some studies have shown that RALY plays a role in promoting cancer in a variety of tumors. However, the biological function and molecular mechanism of RALY in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unknown. TCGA databases were used to gather RALY expression data in NSCLC, the results indicate that RALY is highly expressed in cancer tissue of NSCLC patients. Then we demonstrated that RALY gene expression was notably upregulated in NSCLC tissue and cell lines (A549 and SK-MES-1), and was associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.007) and poorer overall survival in NSCLC patients. Subsequently, RALY in A549 and SK-MES-1 cells was knocked down by lentivirus to analyze the consequences of RALY on the biological behavior of NSCLC cell lines. Our results indicated that RALY knockdown impaired NSCLC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as arrested cells in G1 phase, and the reintroduction of RALY recused its biological phenotype. Furthermore, RALY knockdown down-regulated the expression levels of c-Myc, Cyclin D1, CDK4, MMP9, Rho A ,Rho C, N-cadherin and β-catenin, and up-regulated the expression levels of P27, Rho B and E-cadherin. Therefore, targeting RALY could be a promising molecular target for NSCLC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the recognized capacity of the gut microbiota to regulate intestinal lipid metabolism, the role of specific commensal species remains undefined. Here, we aimed to understand the bacterial effectors and molecular mechanisms by which Lactobacillus paracasei and Escherichia coli regulate lipid metabolism in enterocytes. We show that L-lactate produced by L. paracasei inhibits chylomicron secretion from enterocytes and promotes lipid storage by a mechanism involving L-lactate absorption by enterocytes, its conversion to malonyl-CoA, and the subsequent inhibition of lipid beta-oxidation. In contrast, acetate produced by E. coli also inhibits chylomicron secretion by enterocytes but promotes lipid oxidation by a mechanism involving acetate absorption by enterocytes, its metabolism to acetyl-CoA and AMP, and the subsequent upregulation of the AMPK/PGC-1α/PPARα pathway. Our study opens perspectives for developing specific bacteria- and metabolite-based therapeutic interventions against obesity, atherosclerosis, and malnutrition by targeting lipid metabolism in enterocytes.

Abstract: The purpose of the work was to investigate mechanisms of erythropoietin-induced protection and accelerated recovery of kidneys and ureters from obstructive injury. Unilateral ureteral obstruction was established for 24, 48, and 72 h in C57BL/6 mice using a non-traumatic micro-clip followed by the microscopic quantification of ureteral peristalsis pre- and post-obstruction. Expression of erythropoietin, erythropoietin receptor, β-common receptor, and downstream apoptosis-related markers was assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in ureters and kidneys and compared to the respective organs on the contralateral side within each animal. Expression of genes in kidneys and ureters from mice treated with 20 IU of erythropoietin daily for 72 h prior to obstruction was compared to that of untreated mice following obstruction. Apoptosis in ureteral tissues after 72-h obstruction was assessed via TUNEL assay. Ureteral obstruction increased apoptosis in affected ureters, with peristaltic function halted following all periods of obstruction. Erythropoietin treatment suppressed apoptosis in obstructed tissues and increased the percentage of mice retaining ureteral function immediately following obstruction reversal. Erythropoietin, erythropoietin receptor, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl mRNA expression were down-regulated, while phospho-Nf-ĸb p65 was up-regulated in ureteral epithelia following obstruction. Erythropoietin treatment induced anti-apoptotic signaling via down-regulated Bax mRNA expression and abrogated phospho-Nf-ĸb p65. Erythropoietin-induced protection of ureteral function and accelerated recovery post-obstruction removal is mediated via anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Ureteral function is disrupted even following obstruction removal, negatively affecting renal function due to delayed recovery. Thus, our results represent a potential target for the development of safe therapeutic agents aimed at improving functional recovery from obstructive injury.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of TMEM173/STING-dependent innate immunity has recently provided guidance for the prevention and management of inflammatory disorders. Here, we show that myeloid TMEM173 occupies an essential role in regulating coagulation in bacterial infections through a mechanism independent of type I interferon response. Mechanistically, TMEM173 binding to ITPR1 controls calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum in macrophages and monocytes. The TMEM173-dependent increase in cytosolic calcium drives Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage and activation, which triggers the release of F3, the key initiator of blood coagulation. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the TMEM173-GSDMD-F3 pathway blocks systemic coagulation and improves animal survival in three models of sepsis (cecal ligation and puncture or bacteremia with Escherichia coli or Streptococcus pneumoniae infection). The upregulation of the TMEM173 pathway correlates with the severity of disseminated intravascular coagulation and mortality in patients with sepsis. Thus, TMEM173 is a key regulator of blood clotting during lethal bacterial infections.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex and highly variable neurodegenerative disease. Familial PD is caused by mutations in several genes with diverse and mostly unknown functions. It is unclear how dysregulation of these genes results in the relatively selective death of nigral dopaminergic neurons (DNs). To address this question, we modeled PD by knocking out the PD genes PARKIN (PRKN), DJ-1 (PARK7), and ATP13A2 (PARK9) in independent isogenic human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines. We found increased levels of oxidative stress in all PD lines. Increased death of DNs upon differentiation was found only in the PARKIN knockout line. Using quantitative proteomics, we observed dysregulation of mitochondrial and lysosomal function in all of the lines, as well as common and distinct molecular defects caused by the different PD genes. Our results suggest that precise delineation of PD subtypes will require evaluation of molecular and clinical data.

Abstract: Acquisition of features of mesenchymal cells represents a key step of metastatic progression of cancer cells and searching for mechanisms underlying the acquisition will help design novel clinical strategies for suppressing the metastatic progression. The Deleted in Liver Cancer-1 (DLC-1) gene is a p122/RhoGAP tumor/metastatic suppressor gene. However, the mechanism underlying DLC-1's inhibition of metastasis still remains largely unknown. In this study, we revealed that the DLC-1-deficient, but not the DLC-1-competent, human non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (NSCLCs) could acquire the TGF-β1-induced expression of CD105, a common surface marker of mesenchymal stem cells, with consequent increase in CD105-associated cell motility. Interestingly, the induced CD105 expression and cell motility were subjected to the inhibition by the DLC-1-RhoA-Rock1 signaling through inhibiting the serine phosphorylation at a linker region, but not at the C-terminus, of the Smad3 protein and Smad3 protein nuclear translocation down the canonical TGF-β1 signaling. In addition, the evidence suggested that DLC-1 very likely exerted its inhibitory effects on the TGF-β1 signaling and the associated CD105 acquisition in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Consistent to the in vitro findings, a reverse correlation between CD105 and DLC-1 in protein expression was identified in primary NSCLC tissues and their surrounding non-tumor tissues. In summary, this study revealed a novel anti-metastasis mechanism governed by the DLC-1 tumor/metastasis suppressor, thus helping design new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for NSCLCs.

Abstract: Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1) are key adhesion receptors to mediate neutrophil (PMN) recruitment and intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signaling. Binding of LFA-1 and Mac-1 to their ligands is essential in triggering Ca2+ transients and activating Ca2+-dependent kinases involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and migratory function. While mechanical forces are critical in regulating integrin-mediated Ca2+ transients, it is still unclear how the bond strength of β2-integrin-ligand pair affects Ca2+ responses. Here three typical ligands with known mechanical features with LFA-1 and Mac-1 in our previous work were adopted to quantify their capabilities in inducing Ca2+ transients in adherent PMNs under shear flow. Data indicated that LFA-1 dominates Ca2+ transients in PMNs on intercellular adhesive molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A), while Mac-1 mediates Ca2+ transients induced by receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), consistent with their corresponding bond strengths. These results link β2 integrin-ligand bond strength with Ca2+ transients in PMNs, suggesting high bond strength gives rise to strong Ca2+ response especially under physiological-like shear flow. The outcomes provide a new insight in understanding the mechanical regulatory mechanisms of PMN recruitment.

Abstract: Objective
The aim of this study is to establish the dexamethasone sodium phosphate multivesicular liposomes thermosensative hydrogel (DEX-MVLs-Gel) drug delivery system and to analyze the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and safety of DEX-MVLs-Gel as well as to explore whether the prepared DEX-MVLs-Gel can protect the hearing in the guinea pigs following noise exposure.
Methods
DEX-MVLs formulations were constructed by double emulsion method, and the DEX-MVLs-Gel was prepared after adding P407 and P188 into the DEX-MVLs. A total of 20 adult albino guinea pigs were chosen to establish the animal models with noise-induced hearing loss. After animals were treated with DEX-MVLs-Gel at concentrations of 20, 6 and 2 mg/mL, and 5 mg/mL Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate (DEX-P) solution, respectively, the hearing function, drug concentration in the peripheral lymph fluid, and hair cell morphology were assessed.
Results
The ABR threshold of the 20 mg/mL DEX-MVLs-Gel treated group at the frequencies of 4, 8, 16 and 24 kHz were measured as 47.5 ± 5.2, 48.3 ± 4.1, 55.8 ± 3.8 and 57.5 5 ± 5.2 dB SPL, respectively. Statistical significances were noted between the 20 mg/mL DEX-MVLs-Gel treated group and control group at each frequency (all P < 0.05), between the 2 mg/mL and 6 mg/mL DEX-MVLs-Gel treated groups at the frequencies of 4 and 8 kHz (both P < 0.05). High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) demonstrated that the drug concentrations in the peripheral lymph in all groups were gradually decreased on the 1st, 3rd and 7th d after intratympanic injection. Scattered hair cell loss could be observed mainly in the basal and middle turn in the saline administrated group and the 20 mg/mL DEX-MVLs-Gel administration group, and the hair cell loss was not identified in the apical turn.
Conclusions
A high concentration (20 mg/mL) of DEX-MVLs-Gel exerts significant protective effects upon the guinea pigs with noise-induced hearing loss. The prepared DEX-MVLs-Gel can be effectively maintained in the peripheral lymph fluid of guinea pigs for 3–7 d and MVLs-Gel causes no obvious ototoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Although congenital infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is well recognized as a leading cause of neurodevelopmental defects, HCMV neuropathogenesis remains poorly understood. A major challenge for investigating HCMV-induced abnormal brain development is the strict CMV species specificity, which prevents the use of animal models to directly study brain defects caused by HCMV. We show that infection of human-induced pluripotent-stem-cell-derived brain organoids by a “clinical-like” HCMV strain results in reduced brain organoid growth, impaired formation of cortical layers, and abnormal calcium signaling and neural network activity. Moreover, we show that the impeded brain organoid development caused by HCMV can be prevented by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that recognize the HCMV pentamer complex. These results demonstrate in a three-dimensional cellular biosystem that HCMV can impair the development and function of the human brain and provide insights into the potential capacity of NAbs to mitigate brain defects resulted from HCMV infection.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor in the liver and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The collaborative function between Nucleostemin (NS) and STAT3 has been reported but not well studied in HCC. Here, we found a significant correlation between NS expression and STAT3 phosphorylation, not only in HCC cancers but also in HCC tissues. Patients with high expression of both NS and p-STAT3 show a very poor survival rate. High expression of both NS and p-STAT3 is also associated with tumor size and microvascular invasion. Knocking down the expression of NS greatly reduces the phosphorylation of STAT3. Conversely, overexpression of NS significantly promotes STAT3 phosphorylation. NS and p-STAT3 are located in the nucleus and physiologically interact with each other. Furthermore, NS greatly enhances cell migration and invasion by promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). NS also supports cell proliferation and colony formation. The importance of NS in HCC was further demonstrated by evaluating tumor formation in vivo. Therefore, we demonstrate a critical collaborative function between NS and STAT3 in HCC, providing an invaluable insight into the mechanism of HCC. The concomitant expression of NS and p-STAT3 might be a potential prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in patients with HCC.

Abstract: CES-2 (carboxylesterase-2) belongs to the carboxylesterase gene family, which plays crucial roles in lipid mobilization and chemosensitivity to irinotecan. However, its role in chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin (L-OHP) remains unclear. Herein, L-OHP-resistant cells (HCT-116L and RKOL) were established by increasing the concentration of L-OHP. The results showed that CES2 expression was upregulated in L-OHP-resistant tissues and cells lines (both P < 0.01). Low expression of CES2 correlated with a better survival, and the results were further confirmed in the R2 platform: a biologist friendly web-based genomics analysis and visualization application. Downregulation of CES2 suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and reversed L-OHP resistance by medicating the PI3K signaling pathway in L-OHP-resistant cells. However, both PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and activator (IGF-1) could not medicate CES2 expression. These findings indicated that CES2 may be utilized as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for L-OHP resistance in CRC treatment.

Abstract: The pan-neuron-specific knockdown of dABCA, a Drosophila homologue of the human ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 13 gene, increases social space without affecting climbing ability and induces the early onset of evening activity in adult flies followed by relatively high activity throughout the day. Satellite bouton numbers in the presynaptic terminals of motor neurons are increased in dABCA knockdown flies. In the present study, we further characterized pan-neuron-specific dABCA knockdown flies and found that active zones in the presynaptic terminals of motor neurons increased, whereas learning abilities decreased in larvae. Genetic crossing experiments revealed that the hippo mutation enhanced the hyperactivity phenotype of adults, but suppressed the increased satellite bouton phenotype induced by the dABCA knockdown. Drosophila ABCA is predicted to transport lipid molecules and impair the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids across the plasma membrane, and these local changes are considered to be important for various cellular functions. The disruption of lipid homeostasis in central and peripheral nervous systems by the dABCA knockdown may affect the Hippo-related signaling pathway in order to induce the observed phenotypes.

Neddylation-mediated Nedd4-2 activation regulates ubiquitination modification of renal NBCe1,

Abstract: The sodium-coupled bicarbonate cotransporter 1 (NBCe1) plays an essential role in the maintenance of acid-base homeostasis in the human body. However, little research has been done regarding the modification of NBCe1. Nedd4-2 is one of the most important ubiquitin E3 ligases in the kidney where it is responsible for mediating the ubiquitylation level of many important ion channel proteins; therefore, influencing their expression and membrane localization. In this study, we performed experiments based on a prediction from bioinformatics analysis that NBCe1 might be a Nedd4-2 target protein. The results of co-immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays showed that Nedd4-2 interacted with NBCe1. An in vitro ubiquitination assay further demonstrated that Nedd4-2 is indeed the NBCe1 ubiquitin E3 ligase. The overexpression of Nedd4-2 decreased NBCe1 expression, while MG132 rescued the changes. Nedd4-2 overexpression also altered the subcellular distribution of NBCe1. Furthermore, the kidney specific Nedd4-2-knockout mice certified the alteration of NBCe1. In addition, we speculate that neddylation activates Nedd4-2. A co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that Nedd4-2 interacted with Nedd8. In vitro neddylation experiments further demonstrated that Nedd4-2 underwent neddylation modification. The overexpression of Nedd8 led to decreased NBCe1 expression, while Nedd4-2 inhibition rescued the changes. These findings demonstrate that Nedd4-2 acts as the ubiquitin E3 ligase of NBCe1, mediating the degradation and altering the subcellular distribution of NBCe1, and that the neddylation modification downregulated NBCe1 expression by upregulating Nedd4-2 activity.

Abstract: Fluctuations in ambient temperature along with the presence of pathogenic microorganisms can induce important cellular changes that alter the homeostasis of ectothermic fish. The aim of this study was to evaluate how sudden or gradual changes in environmental temperature together with the administration of Piscirickettsia salmonis modulate the transcription of genes involved in cellular stress response in the liver of Eleginops maclovinus. Fish were subjected to the following experimental conditions in duplicate: C− 12 °C: Injection only with culture medium, C+ 12 °C: Injection with P. salmonis, AM 18 °C: Injection only with culture medium under acclimation at 18 °C, AB 18 °C: Injection with P. salmonis under acclimation at 18 °C, SM 18 °C: Injection only with culture medium and thermal shock at 18°C and SB 18 °C: Injection with P. salmonis and thermal shock at 18°C and sampling at 4-, 8-, 12-, 16- and 20-day post injection (dpi). The genes implied in the heat shock response (HSP70, HSC70, HSP90, and GRP78), apoptosis pathway (BAX and SMAC/Diablo), ubiquitination (E2, E3, ubiquitin, and CHIP), and 26 proteasome complex (PSMB7, PSMC1, and PSMA2) showed expression profiles dependent on time and type of injection applied. All the genes greatly increased their expression levels at day 16 and showed moderate increases at day 20, except for PSMA2 which showed a higher increase between 4- and 12-day post challenges. Our results suggest that the changes observed at the final days of the experiment are due to temperature more than P. salmonis.

Abstract: Summary
To survive and proliferate in diverse host environments with varying nutrient availability, the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii reprograms its metabolism. We have generated and curated a genome-scale metabolic model (iTgo) for the fast-replicating tachyzoite stage, harmonized with experimentally observed phenotypes. To validate the importance of four metabolic pathways predicted by the model, we have performed in-depth in vitro and in vivo phenotyping of mutant parasites including targeted metabolomics and CRISPR-Cas9 fitness screening of all known metabolic genes. This led to unexpected insights into the remarkable flexibility of the parasite, addressing the dependency on biosynthesis or salvage of fatty acids (FAs), purine nucleotides (AMP and GMP), a vitamin (pyridoxal-5P), and a cofactor (heme) in both the acute and latent stages of infection. Taken together, our experimentally validated metabolic network leads to a deeper understanding of the parasite’s biology, opening avenues for the development of therapeutic intervention against apicomplexans.

Therapeutically targetable mechanisms underlying HAND remain elusive, partly due to a lack of a representative model. We developed a human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based model, independently differentiating hiPSCs into neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, and systematically combining to generate a tri-culture with or without HIV infection and ART. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on tri-cultures with HIV-infected microglia revealed inflammatory signatures in the microglia and EIF2 signaling in all three cell types. Treatment with the antiretroviral compound efavirenz (EFZ) mostly resolved these signatures. However, EFZ increased RhoGDI and CD40 signaling in the HIV-infected microglia. This activation was associated with a persistent increase in tumor necrosis factor α production by microglia. This work establishes a tri-culture that recapitulates key features of HIV infection in the CNS and provides a new model to examine the effects of infection, its treatment, and other co-morbid conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is a promising approach in the development of drugs for many indications. 14-3-3 proteins are a family of phosphoprotein-binding molecules with critical functions in dozens of cell signaling networks. 14-3-3s are abundant in the central nervous system, and the small molecule fusicoccin-A (FC-A), a tool compound that can be used to manipulate 14-3-3 PPIs, enhances neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. New semisynthetic FC-A derivatives with improved binding affinity for 14-3-3 complexes have recently been developed. Here, we use a series of screens that identify these compounds as potent inducers of neurite outgrowth through a polypharmacological mechanism. Using proteomics and X-ray crystallography, we discover that these compounds extensively regulate the 14-3-3 interactome by stabilizing specific PPIs, while disrupting others. These results provide new insights into the development of drugs to target 14-3-3 PPIs, a potential therapeutic strategy for CNS diseases.

Abstract: Episodes of acute exacerbations are major drivers of hospitalisation and death from COPD. To date, there are no objective biomarkers of disease activity or biomarkers to predict patient outcome. In this study, 211 patients hospitalised for an acute exacerbation of COPD have been included. At the time of admission, routine blood tests have been performed including complete blood count, C-reactive protein, cardiac troponin T and NT-proBNP. Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) serum concentrations were determined at time of admission, discharge and 180 days after discharge by ELISA. We were able to demonstrate significantly increased HSP27 serum concentrations in COPD patients at time of admission to hospital as compared to HSP27 concentrations obtained 180 days after discharge. In univariable Cox regression analyses, a HSP27 serum concentration ≥ 3098 pg/mL determined at admission was a predictor of all-cause mortality at 90 days, 180 days, 1 year and 3 years. In multivariable analyses, an increased HSP27 serum concentration at admission retained its prognostic ability with respect to all-cause mortality for up to 1-year follow-up. However, an increased HSP27 serum concentration at admission was not an independent predictor of long-term all-cause mortality at 3 years. Elevated serum HSP27 concentrations significantly predicted short-term mortality in patients admitted to hospital with acute exacerbation of COPD and could help to improve outcomes by identifying high-risk patients.

Abstract: Summary
Antiviral immunity in insects is mediated by the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Viruses evade antiviral RNAi by expressing virulence factors known as viral suppressors of RNAi (VSR). Here, we report the identification of VINR, a Drosophila VSR-interacting long non-coding (lnc) RNA that activates non-canonical innate immune signaling upon detection of the dsRNA-binding VSR of Drosophila C virus (DCV). VINR is required for the induction of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes but dispensable for antiviral RNAi. VINR functions by preventing the ubiquitin proteasome-dependent degradation of Cactin, a coiled-coil and arginine-serine-rich domain-containing protein that regulates a non-cannonical antimicrobial pathway for AMP induction. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of VINR in Drosophila cells enhances DCV replication independently of antiviral RNAi, and VINR-knockout adult flies exhibit enhanced disease susceptibility to DCV and bacteria. Our findings reveal a counter counter-defense strategy activated by a lncRNA in response to the viral suppression of the primary antiviral RNAi immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Fluorescent molecules have contributed to basic biological research but there are currently only a limited number of probes available for the detection of non-enzymatic proteins. Here, we report turn-on fluorescent probes mediated by conjugate addition and cyclization (TCC probes). These probes react with multiple amino acids and exhibit a 36-fold greater emission intensity after reaction. We analyzed the reactions between TCC probes and nuclear receptors by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, spectrofluorometry, and fluorescence microscopy. In vitro analysis showed that probes consisting of a protein ligand and TCC could label vitamin D receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. Moreover, we demonstrated that not only a ligand unit but also a peptide unit can label the target protein in a complex mixture.

Abstract: Actin filaments are highly dynamic structures involved in many cellular processes including cell-to-cell/substrate association and cell motility. The actin cytoskeleton is tightly regulated by actin-binding proteins, which include the members of the ADF (actin-depolymerizing factor)/cofilin family. The members of the LIM kinase family of proteins (LIMK1 and 2) regulate actin dynamics by controlling the binding affinity of ADF/cofilin towards actin. LIMK2 has two major splice variants, LMK2a and LIMK2b. We have generated mice lacking LIMK2a expression (LIMK2a KO), to study its specific role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The LIMK2a KO mice showed a significant prolonged bleeding complication upon injuries compared to wild type mice. This prolonged bleeding prompted us to check the expression of the LIMK2 protein in platelets as it was previously suggested that it is not expressed in platelets. We showed that human and mouse express LIMK2 in platelets and using our LIMK2a KO mice we have identified a potential key role for LIMK2 in platelet functions including platelet spreading, aggregation and thrombus formation.

Abstract: The cell fusion is a widespread process, which takes place in many systems in vivo and in vitro. Fusion of cells is frequently related to tetraploidy, which can be found within natural physiological conditions, e.g., placentation, and in pathophysiological conditions, such as cancer and early pregnancy failure in humans. Here we investigate the mechanism of tetraploidization with help of femtosecond laser-induced mouse blastomere fusion by the means of Hoechst staining, GFP, BODIPY dyes and fluorescent species generated intracellularly by a femtosecond laser. We establish diffusive mixing of cytosol, whereas the large components of a cytoplasm (organelles, cytoskeleton) are poorly diffusible and are not completely mixed after cell fusion and a subsequent division. We show that mechanisms which are responsible for the formation of a common metaphase plate triggered tetraploidization in fused mouse embryos and could be a significant factor in polyploidy formation in vivo. Thus, our results suggest that microtubules play a critical role in tetraploidization.

Abstract: Concomitant treatment with deferoxamine (DFO) protects neural cells from iron and heme-mediated oxidative injury, but also disrupts cell responses to iron loading that may be protective. We hypothesized that DFO treatment and withdrawal would subsequently increase neuronal vulnerability to hemoglobin. Pretreatment with DFO followed by its washout increased neuronal loss after subsequent hemoglobin exposure by 3-4-fold compared with control vehicle-pretreated cultures. This was associated with reduced ferritin induction by hemoglobin; expression of heme oxygenase-1, which catalyzes iron release from heme, was not altered. Increased neuronal loss was prevented by exogenous apoferritin or by continuing DFO or antioxidants throughout the experimental course. Cell nonheme iron levels after hemoglobin treatment were similar in DFO-pretreated and control cultures. These results indicate that DFO deconditions neurons and subsequently increases their vulnerability to heme-mediated injury. Its net effect after CNS hemorrhage may be highly dependent on the timing and duration of its administration. Withdrawal of DFO while heme or iron levels remain elevated may be deleterious, and may negate any benefit of prior concomitant therapy.

Abstract: The properties and number of neural stem cells (NSCs) in neural tissue are important issues for the regenerative capacity of the spinal cord in different organisms or developmental stages. In this study, we investigated the self-renewal and differentiation potential of NSCs from adult spinal cords of adult geckos (Gecko japonicus) and mice. The sphere forming ratio of mouse NSCs was higher than that of gecko NSCs, and the sphere forming time of mouse NSCs was shorter as well. In addition, serum-induced differentiation of NSCs gave rise to more β-tubulin III (TUBB3)-positive progeny in geckos, whereas NSCs gave rise to more glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells in mice. We further conducted single sphere RNA-seq for both gecko and mouse NSCs, and transcriptome data revealed that purified NSC populations form either geckos or mice are heterogeneous and stay at various differentiated stages even with similar appearance. Mouse NSCs expressed more glial markers and gecko NSCs expressed more neuronal markers, which is consistent with cell fate determination of mouse and gecko NSCs in differentiation assays.

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women in both developed and developing countries with a rising incidence. Using the MMTV-PyMT transgenic mouse model and xenografted breast cancer model, we found that R5, a neutralizing antibody to Robo1, significantly inhibited BC growth and metastasis. Angiogenesis is involved in the growth and metastasis of BC. Interestingly, R5 significantly decreases microvessel density in BC tissues, and inhibits blood vessel formation and development in in vivo chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), yolk sac membrane (YSM) and Matrigel plug models. To investigate whether its anti-breast cancer efficacy is ascribed to its direct antiangiogenic properties, xenografted breast cancer model on CAM was established. Furthermore, R5 significantly reduces the tube formation of the vascular plexus on xenografted breast tumor on CAM. R5 also suppresses the migration and the tubular structure formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by down-regulating the expression of filamin A (FLNA). These findings show that R5 has the potential to be a promising agent for the treatment of BC by suppressing the tumor-induced angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 (collectively RUVBL1/2) are essential AAA+ ATPases that function as co-chaperones and have been implicated in cancer. Here we investigated the molecular and phenotypic role of RUVBL1/2 ATPase activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We find that RUVBL1/2 are overexpressed in NSCLC patient tumors, with high expression associated with poor survival. Utilizing a specific inhibitor of RUVBL1/2 ATPase activity, we show that RUVBL1/2 ATPase activity is necessary for the maturation or dissociation of the PAQosome, a large RUVBL1/2-dependent multiprotein complex. We also show that RUVBL1/2 have roles in DNA replication, as inhibition of its ATPase activity can cause S-phase arrest, which culminates in cancer cell death via replication catastrophe. While in vivo pharmacological inhibition of RUVBL1/2 results in modest antitumor activity, it synergizes with radiation in NSCLC, but not normal cells, an attractive property for future preclinical development.

Abstract: Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase, participates in various age-related disorders, such as dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have revealed that minute cholesterol crystals (CCs), which are generated after excess free cholesterol accumulation, form not only in mature atherosclerotic plaques but also extremely early in atherosclerosis. Since endothelial dysfunction is an early feature of atherogenesis, this study was designed to investigate the role of SIRT6 in minute CC-induced endothelial dysfunction and the related mechanism. We found that minute CCs could be endocytosed by endothelial cells (ECs), which then decreased nitric oxide (NO) levels and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and expression, upregulated the expression of adhesion molecules and enhanced monocyte adhesion to ECs. In addition, minute CCs significantly suppressed SIRT6 expression in ECs. Moreover, the overexpression of SIRT6 could mitigate minute CC-induced endothelial dysfunction. In addition, the expression of Nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor2 (Nrf2) was suppressed after minute CC treatment, whereas SIRT6 overexpression reversed this decrease in Nrf2 expression. More importantly, Nrf2 activation also notably attenuated minute CC-induced endothelial dysfunction. In vivo experiments further indicated that endothelium-specific SIRT6 depletion impaired vascular endothelial function and suppressed Nrf2 expression in hyperlipidemic mice. Taken together, these results indicate that SIRT6 rescues minute CC-induced endothelial dysfunction partly via Nrf2 activation.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibitors of Mek1/2 and Gsk3β, known as 2i, and, together with leukemia inhibitory factor, enhance the derivation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and promote ground-state pluripotency (2i/L-ESCs). However, recent reports show that prolonged Mek1/2 suppression impairs developmental potential of ESCs, and is rescued by serum (S/L-ESCs). Here, we show that culturing ESCs in Activin A and BMP4, and in the absence of MEK1/2 inhibitor (ABC/L medium), establishes advanced stem cells derived from ESCs (esASCs). We demonstrate that esASCs contributed to germline lineages, full-term chimeras and generated esASC-derived mice by tetraploid complementation. We show that, in contrast to 2i/L-ESCs, esASCs display distinct molecular signatures and a stable hypermethylated epigenome, which is reversible and similar to serum-cultured ESCs. Importantly, we also derived novel ASCs (blASCs) from blastocysts in ABC/L medium. Our results provide insights into the derivation of novel ESCs with DNA hypermethylation from blastocysts in chemically defined medium.

Abstract: Our previous study had shown that chronic corticosterone (CORT) exposure causes excessive fat deposition in chicken liver, yet it remains unknown whether it is associated with inflammation and fibrosis. In general, heat shock proteins (HSPs) are activated in response to acute stress to play a cytoprotective role, and this activation is associated with m6A-mediated post-transcriptional regulation. However, changes of HSPs and the m6A methylation on their mRNAs in response to chronic CORT treatment in chicken liver have not been reported. In this study, chronic CORT exposure induced inflammation and fibrosis in chicken liver, associated with significantly modulated expression of HSPs that was significantly upregulated at mRNA level yet downregulated at protein level. Concurrently, m6A methyltransferases METTL3 content was upregulated together with the level of m6A methylation on HSPs transcripts. The m6A-seq analysis revealed 2-6 significantly (P < 0.05) hypermethylated m6A peaks in the mRNA of 4 different species of HSPs in CORT-treated chicken liver. HSP90B1 transcript had 6 differentially methylated m6A peaks among which peaks on exon 16 and exon 17 showed 3.14- and 4.72-fold of increase, respectively. Mutation of the 8 predicted m6A sites on exon 16 and exon 17 resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) increase in eGFP-fused content of HSP90B1 exon 16 and exon 17 fragment in 293 T cells, indicating a possible role of m6A in post-transcriptional regulation of HSPs. In conclusion, chronic CORT exposure induces inflammation and fibrosis in chicken liver along with an increase in the levels and m6A methylation of several HSPs mRNAs; HSPs levels were however reduced under the indicated conditions. Results presented suggest that the reduction in HSPs levels may be associated with m6A methylation in CORT-exposed chickens.

Abstract: Summary
Evolution of antibody repertoire against the Ebola virus (EBOV) proteome was characterized in an acutely infected patient receiving supportive care alone to elucidate virus-host interactions over time. Differential kinetics are observed for IgM-IgG-IgA epitope diversity, antibody binding, and affinity maturation to EBOV proteins. During acute illness, antibodies predominate to VP40 and glycoprotein (GP). At day 13 of clinical illness, a marked increase in antibody titers to most EBOV proteins and affinity maturation to GP is associated with rapid decline in viral replication and illness severity. At one year, despite undetectable virus, a diverse IgM repertoire against VP40 and GP epitopes is observed suggesting occult viral persistence. Rabbit immunization experiments identify key immunodominant sites of GP, while challenge studies in mice found these epitopes induce EBOV-neutralizing antibodies and protect against lethal EBOV challenge. This study reveals markers of viral persistence and provides promising approaches for development and evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics.

Abstract: Takeda-G-protein-receptor-5 (TGR5) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activated by bile acids, and mortalin is a multipotent chaperone of the HSP70 family. In the present study, TGR5 was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) specimens, and TGR5 expression in ECC tissues and adjacent tissues was compared. In vitro TGR5 was overexpressed and knocked down in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) cell line RBE and human extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) cell line QBC-939 to observe its effects on the biological behavior of cholangiocarcinoma (CC) cells, including proliferation, apoptosis and migration. In vivo xenograft model was constructed to explore the role of TGR5 in CC growth. Proteins that interacted with TGR5 were screened using an immunoprecipitation spectrometry approach, and the identified protein was down-regulated to investigate its contribution to CC growth. The present study demonstrated that TGR5 is highly expressed in CC tissues, and strong TGR5 expression may indicate high malignancy in CC. Furthermore, TGR5 promotes CC cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis resistance. TGR5 boosts CC growth in vivo. In addition, TGR5 combines with mortalin and regulates mortalin expression in the CC cell line. Mortalin participates in the TGR5-induced increase in CC cell proliferation. In conclusion, TGR5 is of clinical significance based on its implications for the degree of malignancy in patients with CC. Mortalin may be a downstream component regulated by TGR5, and TGR5 promotes cholangiocarcinoma at least partially by interacting with mortalin and upregulating its expression. Both TGR5 and mortalin are positive regulators, and may serve as potential therapeutic targets for CC.

Abstract: Although human adipose derived stem cells (hADSCs) hold great promises for regenerative medicine, their key biological properties remain poorly understood. In particular, proliferation defects resulted from deep quiescence (dormancy) and senescence represent a major hurdle in hADSC production and clinical application. We have developed a model system for mechanistic dissection of hADSC quiescence and senescence. p57Kip2, a major CDK inhibitor, was highly expressed in quiescent and senescent hADSCs but its level quickly declined upon stem cell activation. p57Kip2 overexpression induced quiescence in spite of proliferative signals and its knockdown promoted cell cycle reentry even with induction of quiescence presumably through modulating the CDK2–CyclinE1 complex. Given its key role in quiescence and senescence, p57Kip2 may be exploited for innovative strategies to amplify hADSCs of high quality for clinics.

Abstract: Fibrosis is a key pathological event during muscle aging that accelerates the development of sarcopenia. We show that sarcolipin (SLN) is highly expressed during aging, promotes intracellular calcium overload and participates in impaired myogenic differentiation. d-Galactose (D-gal) was used to induce senescence in C2C12 myoblasts. Conventional AAV-mediated SLN knockdown cells were used to study the role of SLN in muscle physiology and pathophysiology. C2C12 cells were treated with D-gal, which promoted fibrosis and SLN upregulation. The expression of TGF-β1 and α-SMA, which participate in myogenic transdifferentiation, were also elevated. C2C12 cells with reduced sarcolipin expression produced decreased amounts of collagen. Our study identified an unrecognized role of SLN in regulating myogenic transdifferentiation during aging-associated skeletal muscle cell fibrosis. Targeting SLN may be a novel therapeutic strategy to relieve sarcopenia-associated muscle fibrosis.

Abstract: Background and aims
Recent clinical evidences show that patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease can benefit from a targeting IL-1β treatment. Caspase-1 is an important factor for pyroptosis and is responsible for mature and release of interleukin (IL)-1β. Here we investigated the effect of caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 on atherosclerosis and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) pyroptosis.
Methods
Human carotid artery plaques and aortas from ApoE−/− mice which were gavaged with VX-765 or vehicle while fed with western diet were examined for plaque burden using Oil Red O staining and Immunohistochemistry staining. Dedifferentiated primary cultured mice VSMCs treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) were applied to examine cell pyroptosis.
Results
The distribution of a-SMA and active pyroptotic indicators had a lot of overlaps near the necrotic core, at the lesion surface and in the intra-plaque hemorrhage area in human or mice plaque. In vitro studies further demonstrated that OxLDL induced VSMCs pyroptosis through activating NLRP3 inflammasome. What's more, VX-765 significantly inhibited the progression of established atheroma and the development of atherosclerosis, without substantially influence lipoprotein level in plasma. VX-765 also significantly reduced VSMCs pyroptosis and IL-1β processing induced by OxLDL.
Conclusions
VX-765 inhibits VSMCs pyroptosis during atherogenesis and targeting caspase-1 activity may be a potential treatment strategy for atherosclerotic diseases.

Abstract: Survivin is a newly identified tumour-associated antigen and has been demonstrated to be an excellent target for immunotherapy in several cancers, but its role in hepatocellular carcinoma treatment is still unknown. In this study, survivin-derived peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors were induced by multiple stimulations with HLA-A2- restricted survivin peptide-pulsed T2 cells. The induced CTLs exhibited specific lysis of T2 cells pulsed with the peptide and HLA-A2+ hepatocellular carcinoma cells expressing survivin, while HLA-A2+ hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines that did not express survivin were not recognized by the CTLs. These results suggest that the survivin peptide epitope could be a potential target of specific immunotherapy for HLA-A2+ patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: Reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune are two emerging hallmarks of cancers. Accumulating evidence suggest that reprogrammed energy metabolism contributes to a tumor-suppressive immune microenvironment in cancers. Macrophages are the most abundant immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and M2 macrophages are profoundly implicated in tumor initiation and progression. By gene set enrichment analysis, we found that glycolysis signature was closely associated with the M2 macrophage phenotype in gastric cancer. Enhanced glycolysis is characterized by significant production of lactate. Interestingly, we found that lactic acid is able to skew macrophage toward a M2-like state. Treatment of THP-1 cells or human monocytes with gastric cancer cell-derived conditioned media or lactic acid significantly increased expression of M2-related markers and faintly attenuated expression of M1-related markers. Moreover, knockdown of LDHA suppressed the ability of gastric cancer to skew macrophage toward M2 phenotype as revealed by reduced expression of M2-related markers and cytokines. Mechanistically, a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC), a monocarboxylate channel transporter (MCT) inhibitor, or HIF1α knockdown, significantly abrogated CD163 and ARG1 expression in THP-1 cells, suggesting that MCT-HIF1α signaling is responsible for macrophage polarization. Collectively, our findings identify the lactate-MCT-HIF1α axis as a critical signaling cascade that couples metabolic reprogramming to macrophage polarization in gastric cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Immune-checkpoint blockers can promote sustained clinical responses in a subset of cancer patients. Recent research has shown that a subpopulation of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells functions as gatekeepers, sensitizing tumors to anti-PD-1 treatment via production of interleukin-12 (IL-12). Hypothesizing that myeloid cell-targeted nanomaterials could be used to deliver small-molecule IL-12 inducers, we performed high-content image-based screening to identify the most efficacious small-molecule compounds. Using one lead candidate, LCL161, we created a myeloid-targeted nanoformulation that induced IL-12 production in intratumoral myeloid cells in vivo, slowed tumor growth as a monotherapy, and had no significant systemic toxicity. These results pave the way for developing combination immunotherapeutics by harnessing IL-12 production for immunostimulation.

Abstract: Diabetic bone defects may exhibit impaired endochondral ossification (ECO) leading to delayed bone repair. AdipoRon, a receptor agonist of adiponectin polymers, can ameliorate diabetes and related complications, as well as overcome the disadvantages of the unstable structure of artificial adiponectin polymers. Here, the effects of AdipoRon on the survival and differentiation of chondrocytes in a diabetic environment were explored focusing on related mechanisms in gene and protein levels. In vivo, AdipoRon was applied to diet-induced-obesity (DIO) mice, a model of obesity and type 2 diabetes, with femoral fracture. Sequential histological evaluations and micro-CT were examined for further verification. We found that AdipoRon could ameliorate cell viability, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and promote mRNA expression of chondrogenic markers and cartilaginous matrix production of ATDC5 cells in high glucose medium via activating ERK1/2 pathway. Additionally, DIO mice with intragastric AdipoRon administration had more neocartilage and accelerated new bone formation. These data suggest that AdipoRon could stimulate bone regeneration via ECO in diabetes.

Abstract: Butyrate-induced autophagy and anti-inflammatory effects of IECs plays an important role in UC. HSP has been proved to be associated with autophagy. HSF2, as an important regulator of HSP, has been determined to be highly expressed in UC. This study was designed to elucidate the relationship between HSF2, butyrate and epithelial autophagy and the potential mechanism of HSF2-related autophagy in UC. The autophagy levels and HSF2 expression in intestinal mucosa were increased in UC patients compared to controls. In DSS colitis models, hsf2-/- mice exhibited more severe intestinal inflammation and lower autophagy levels than wild-type mice. HSF2 expression could be induced by sodium butyrate and LPS as a dose-response relationship in HT-29 cells, epigenetically via increasing histone acetylation levels at the promoter region by sodium butyrate. Autophagy induced by sodium butyrate was promoted by overexpression HSF2 in HT-29 cells. Moreover, overexpression HSF2 decreased the expression and phosphorylation levels of PI3K, Akt and mTOR induced by sodium butyrate. HSF2 might induced by sodium butyrate and inflammation and played protective roles in UC by enhancing autophagy of IECs. This indicated that HSF2 may be a critical target for autophagy modulation and a new potential therapeutic target in UC.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota has been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but causal alterations preceding CRC have not been elucidated. To prospectively assess microbiome changes prior to colorectal neoplasia, we investigated samples from 100 Lynch syndrome patients using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of colon biopsies, coupled with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of feces. Colectomy and CRC history represented the largest effects on microbiome profiles. A subset of Clostridiaceae were depleted in stool corresponding with baseline adenomas, while Desulfovibrio was enriched both in stool and in mucosal biopsies. A classifier leveraging stool metatranscriptomes resulted in modest power to predict interval development of preneoplastic colonic adenoma. Predictive transcripts corresponded with a shift in flagellin contributors and oxidative metabolic microenvironment, potentially factors in local CRC pathogenesis. This suggests that the effectiveness of prospective microbiome monitoring for adenomas may be limited but supports the potential causality of these consistent, early microbial changes in colonic neoplasia.

Abstract: Summary
Rat embryonic stem cells (rESCs) are capable of contributing to all differentiated tissues, including the germ line in chimeric animals, and represent a unique, authentic alternative to mouse embryonic stem cells for studying stem cell pluripotency and self-renewal. Here, we describe an EGFP reporter transgene that tracks expression of the benchmark naive pluripotency marker gene Rex1 (Zfp42) in the rat. Insertion of the EGFP reporter gene downstream of the Rex1 promoter disrupted Rex1 expression, but REX1-deficient rESCs and rats were viable and apparently normal, validating this targeted knockin transgene as a neutral reporter. The Rex1-EGFP gene responded to self-renewal/differentiation factors and validated the critical role of β-catenin/LEF1 signaling. The stem cell reporter also allowed the identification of functionally distinct sub-populations of cells within rESC cultures, thus demonstrating its utility in discriminating between cell states in rat stem cell cultures, as well as providing a tool for tracking Rex1 expression in the rat.

Abstract: Summary
The trinuclear ruthenium amine ruthenium red (RuR) inhibits diverse ion channels, including K2P potassium channels, TRPs, the calcium uniporter, CALHMs, ryanodine receptors, and Piezos. Despite this extraordinary array, there is limited information for how RuR engages targets. Here, using X-ray crystallographic and electrophysiological studies of an RuR-sensitive K2P, K2P2.1 (TREK-1) I110D, we show that RuR acts by binding an acidic residue pair comprising the “Keystone inhibitor site” under the K2P CAP domain archway above the channel pore. We further establish that Ru360, a dinuclear ruthenium amine not known to affect K2Ps, inhibits RuR-sensitive K2Ps using the same mechanism. Structural knowledge enabled a generalizable design strategy for creating K2P RuR “super-responders” having nanomolar sensitivity. Together, the data define a “finger in the dam” inhibition mechanism acting at a novel K2P inhibitor binding site. These findings highlight the polysite nature of K2P pharmacology and provide a new framework for K2P inhibitor development.

Abstract: Postmenopausal osteoporosis is one of the most common types of osteoporosis resulting from estrogen deficiency in elderly women. In addition, hypertension is another common disease in the elderly, and it has become an independent risk factor for osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. Here, we report for the first time that felodipine, a first-line antihypertensive agent, significantly prevents postmenopausal osteoporosis in addition to its vasodilation properties. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that treatment with felodipine significantly downregulated the genes associated with osteoclast differentiation. RNA-sequencing and western blotting suggested that felodipine could inhibit bone resorption by suppressing MAPK pathway phosphorylation. Moreover, micro-CT scanning and histological analysis in an ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone-loss mouse model indicated that felodipine might be a potent drug for preventing osteoporotic fractures. Therefore, this study proposes an attractive and promising agent with vasodilation properties to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Abstract: Purpose
The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized of a cluster of medical disorders. Altered function of adipose tissue has a significant impact on whole-body metabolism and represents a key driver for MetS. In this study, we aim to explore the function of human circular RNA H19 (hsa_circH19) in human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs).
Methods
The blood samples from MetS patients and normal subjects were used to determine the expression level of the hsa_circH19. After knock-down of hsa_circH19 in hADSCs, we measured the expression of adipogenic genes. Oil red O, Nile red staining assay and triglyceride assessment were performed to examine the role of hsa_circH19 in hADSCs differentiation. Then, RNA Pull-down and RIP assays were conducted to explore the related RNA binding protein of hsa_circH19. IF was performed to determine the potential molecular regulatory mechanism.
Results
After accounting for confounding factors, high levels of hsa_circH19 remained an independent risk factor for MetS. Furthermore, the knockdown of hsa_circH19 significantly increased the expression of adipogenic genes and the formation of lipid droplets. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that has_circH19 shared multiple binding sites with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) and their interaction was validated by circRNA pull-down and RIP assays. Mechanistically, depletion of hsa_circH19 triggered translocation of sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP1) from cytoplasm to nucleus in the presence of PTBP1.
Conclusion
Our experiments suggest that knockdown of hsa_circH19 promotes hADCSs adipogenic differentiation via targeting of PTBP1. In consequence, the expression of hsa_circH19 might correlated to lipid metabolism in adipose tissue from MetS.

Abstract: Renal fibrosis is a key pathological feature in chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). Dysregulation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) homeostasis is implicated in the pathogenesis of CKDs. Here, C57/BL6 mice were allocated to Sham and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) groups, which were treated with NaHS or NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor 16673-34-0 for 3–14 days. UUO mice displayed downregulation of H2S production and increased macrophage infiltration in obstructed kidneys. H2S donor NaHS treatment attenuated renal damage and fibrosis and inhibited M1 and M2 macrophage infiltration. NLPR3 inflammasome was activated and levels of phosphorylated nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65 subunit, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and interleukin (IL)-4 protein were increased in the kidneys after UUO. NLRP3 inhibitor inactivated NF-κB and IL-4/STAT6 signaling, suppressed M1 and M2 macrophage infiltration and attenuated renal damage and fibrosis in UUO mice. NaHS treatment also suppressed NLRP3, NF-κB and IL-4/STAT6 activation in the obstructed kidneys. In conclusion, the therapeutic effects of H2S on UUO-induced renal injury and fibrosis are at least in part by inhibition of M1 and M2 macrophage infiltration. H2S suppresses NLRP3 activation and subsequently inactivates NF-κB and IL-4/STAT6 signaling, which may contribute to the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of H2S.

Abstract: The cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues are both striated and contractile but their intrinsic cellular properties are distinct. The minimal cardiomyocyte proliferation and the lack of cardiac stem cells directly leads to poor heart repair in adult mammals. But in skeletal muscle, the robust proliferation of widespread muscle stem cells support efficient muscle regeneration. The endogenous cardiomyocyte and muscle stem cell proliferation has been analyzed in common laboratory animals but not in large mammals including pigs, which are more comparable to human. In this study, we rigorously examined the cell cycle dynamics of porcine cardiomyocytes and muscle stem cells through different developmental stages. Proliferative cardiomyocytes and muscle stem cells were broadly observed in the embryonic heart and limb muscle respectively. Muscle stem cells continue to proliferate postnatally but cardiomyocyte proliferation was drastically reduced after birth. However, robust cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity was detected around postnatal day 20, which could be attributed to the binucleation but not cell division. Increased proliferating cells were detected in maternal heart during early pregnancy but they represent non-cardiomyocyte cell types. The islet1 expressing cells were only identified in the embryonic and new born porcine hearts. Furthermore, the accumulated oxidative DNA damage in the cardiac but not skeletal muscle during development could be responsible for the diminished cardiomyocyte proliferation in adult pig. Similarities and differences in the proliferation of heart and skeletal muscle cells are identified in pigs across different developmental stages. Such cellular proliferative features must be taken into account when using porcine models for cardiovascular and muscular research.

Abstract: MUC1 is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA) overexpressed in many tumor types, which makes it an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. However, this marker is a non-mutated antigen without high immunogenicity. In this study, we designed several new altered peptides by replacing amino acids in their sequences, which were derived from a low-affinity MUC1 peptide, thus bypassing immune tolerance. Compared to the wild-type (WT) peptide, the altered MUC1 peptides (MUC11081-1089L2, MUC11156-1164L2, MUC11068-1076Y1) showed higher affinity to the HLA-A0201 molecule and stronger immunogenicity. Furthermore, these altered peptides resulted in the generation of more cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that could cross-recognize gastric cancer cells expressing WT MUC1 peptides, in an HLA-A0201-restricted manner. In addition, M1.1 (MUC1950-958), a promising antitumor peptide that has been tested in multiple tumors, was not able to induce stronger antitumor responses. Collectively, our results demonstrated that altered peptides from MUC1, as potential HLA-A0201-restricted CTL epitopes, could serve as peptide vaccines or constitute components of peptide-loaded dendritic cell vaccines for gastric cancer treatment.

Abstract: The copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is decreased in most cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), compared to normal counterparts. However, a decrease in mtDNA usually leads to defects in cell proliferation, which contradicts the robustness of cancer cell proliferation. In this study, we found that four out of seven HCC cell lines were of the mtDNA-less type. Interestingly, FOXM1, a member of the FOX transcription factor family, was highly expressed in a subset of them with proliferative potential maintained. B-MYB, a partner of FOXM1, was also expressed in the same cell lines. RNAi-mediated experiments demonstrated that when FOXM1/B-MYB was silenced in the cell lines, cell cycle-related genes were downregulated, while p21Cip1 was induced with senescence-associated β-galactosidase, resulting in G1/S cell cycle arrest. These results suggest that high expression of FOXM1/B-MYB is critical for sustaining cell proliferation in mtDNA-less cells. In addition, we found that high expression of FOXM1 was mediated by the deubiquitinating enzyme, OTUB1, in one cell line. Thus, interference with FOXM1/B-MYB expression, such as through OTUB1 inhibition, may induce a dormant state of senescence-like proliferation arrest in mtDNA-less cancer cells. This finding may be utilized for the development of precision medicine for relevant cancers.

Abstract: CXCR5+ CD8 T cells, sometimes termed T follicular cytotoxic (Tfc) cells, are characterized by high proinflammatory cytokine and cytolytic molecule expression and low exhaustion and checkpoint molecule expression. Additionally, Tfc cells could promote B cell responses and support Ig release. It is yet unclear how Tfc cells could help B cells when they have the potential to mediate cytotoxicity at the same time. In this study, we found that Tfc cells expressed significantly higher levels of CD40L than non-Tfc CD8 T cells. Interestingly, Tfc cells from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients presented significantly higher CD40L than Tfc cells from healthy controls in a manner that was associated with CRC stage. Coincubation of Tfc cells and autologous B cells resulted in higher CD40L expression in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, activated Tfc cells, when incubated with B cells, presented rapid downregulation of perforin and granzyme B. In general, greater than 50% of tumor-infiltrating Tfc cells expressed CD40L. In addition, the level of CD40L in tumor-infiltrating Tfc cells was higher in stage IV CRC patients than in stage II and stage III CRC patients. Interestingly, the levels of perforin and granzyme B expression by tumor-infiltrating Tfc cells were inversely correlated with the level of CD40L expression by tumor-infiltrating Tfc cells. Overall, we demonstrated that an inverse association existed between CD40L and cytotoxic molecule expression in Tfc cells from CRC patients.

Abstract: Protein kinase D (PKD) plays an important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload. However, the mechanism involved is unclear. This study, using primary cardiomyocyte culture, PKD knockdown and overexpression, and other molecular techniques, tested our hypothesis that PKD pathway mediates cardiac hypertrophy by negatively regulating autophagy in cardiomyocyte. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Wistar rats and cell hypertrophy was induced by norepinephrine treatment (PE, 10−4 mol/L), and divided into the following groups: (1) Vehicle; (2) PE; (3) PE + control siRNA; (4) PE + Rapamycin (100 nM); (5) PE + PKD-siRNA (2 × 108 U/0.1 ml); (6) PE + PKD siRNA + 3 MA (10 mM). The results showed that PE treatment induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which were confirmed by cell size and biomarkers of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy including increased ANP and BNP mRNA. PKD knockdown or Rapamycin significantly inhibited PE-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In addition, PKD siRNA increased autophagy activity determined by electron microscopy, increased biomarkers of autophagy by Western blot, accompanied by down-regulated AKT/mTOR/S6K pathway. All the effects of PKD knockout were inhibited by co-treatment with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor. Oppositely, the autophagy in cardiomyocytes was inhibited by PKD overexpression. These results suggest that PKD participates in the development of cardiac hypertrophy by regulating autophagy via AKT/mTOR/S6K pathway.

Abstract: The present study was undertaken to investigate genetic variability in a fragment comprising 5′UTR along with partial coding sequence of Hsp70 gene and its association with thermotolerance traits in Murrah buffalo at ICAR-Research Complex for Eastern Region, Patna (India). The allelic variants were identified from genomic DNA samples using SSCP technique. The PCR products were sequenced and analyzed. Data on different thermotolerance traits recorded in three seasons were analyzed by least squares ANOVA taking the SSCP genotypes as fixed effect. Two allelic variants (A and B), each of 503-bp in size, were documented with frequency of 0.59 and 0.41, respectively, and three genotypes (AA, AB and BB) with corresponding frequency of 0.30, 0.58 and 0.12. The allelic variants were due to single nucleotide substitution at 55th base position leading to a change of threonine (A) to methionine (B) in amino acid sequence. Both the allelic variants had 99.8% similarity in nucleotide sequence. In phylogenetic tree, allele A was in a cluster while allele B and Gangatiri cattle sequence formed a different cluster. The SSCP genotypes had significant effect on different thermotolerance traits in summer with thermo-humidity index of ≥ 84. Buffaloes with AA genotype had the highest (P ˂ 0.05) summer evening rectal temperature, respiration rate and pulse rate, inferring that the buffaloes carrying AA genotype had more stress in summer than those with AB and BB genotype. These SSCP genotypes might have differential role in heat shock protein response to induce thermotolerance of Murrah buffaloes in Gangetic plains.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exist in a dormant state and progressively lose regenerative potency as they undergo successive divisions. Why this functional decline occurs and how this information is encoded is unclear. To better understand how this information is stored, we performed RNA sequencing on HSC populations differing only in their divisional history. Comparative analysis revealed that genes upregulated with divisions are enriched for lineage genes and regulated by cell-cycle-associated transcription factors, suggesting that proliferation itself drives lineage priming. Downregulated genes are, however, associated with an HSC signature and targeted by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). The PRC2 catalytic subunits Ezh1 and Ezh2 promote and suppress the HSC state, respectively, and successive divisions cause a switch from Ezh1 to Ezh2 dominance. We propose that cell divisions drive lineage priming and Ezh2 accumulation, which represses HSC signature genes to consolidate information on divisional history into memory.
