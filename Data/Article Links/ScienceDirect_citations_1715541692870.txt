Abstract: Dendritic Ca2+ plays an important role not only in synaptic integration and synaptic plasticity, but also in dendritic excitability in midbrain dopamine neurons. However, the functional organization of dendritic Ca2+ signals in the dopamine neurons remains largely unknown. We therefore investigated dendritic Ca2+ signals by measuring glutamate-induced Ca2+ increases along the dendrites of acutely isolated midbrain dopamine neurons. Maximal doses of glutamate induced a [Ca2+]c rise with similar amplitudes in proximal and distal dendritic regions of a dopamine neuron. Glutamate receptors contributed incrementally to the [Ca2+]c rise according to their distance from the soma, with a reciprocal decrement in the contribution of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCCs). The contribution of AMPA and NMDA receptors increased with dendritic length, but that of metabotropic glutamate receptors decreased. At low doses of glutamate at which spontaneous firing was sustained, the [Ca2+]c rise was higher in the distal than the proximal regions of a dendrite, possibly due to the increased spontaneous firing rate. These results indicate that functional organization of Ca2+ signals in the dendrites of dopamine neurons requires different combination of VOCCs and glutamate receptors according to dendritic length, and that regional Ca2+ rises in dendrites respond differently to applied glutamate concentration.

Abstract: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage in the heart occurs mainly during the first minutes of reperfusion. Urocortin (Ucn) is a member of the corticotrophin-releasing factor that has been identified as a potent endogenous cardioprotector peptide when used in pre- and postconditioning protocols. However, the underlying mechanisms are not completely elucidated. Here, we focused on intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) handling by Ucn when applied in early reperfusion. We used Langendorff-perfused rat hearts to determine hemodynamic parameters, and confocal microscopy to study global [Ca2+]i transients evoked by electrical stimulation in isolated cardiomyocytes loaded with fluorescence Ca2+ dye fluo-3AM. We found that the acute application of Ucn at the onset of reperfusion, in isolated hearts submitted to ischemia, fully recovered the hearts contractility and relaxation. In isolated cardiac myocytes, following ischemia we observed that the diastolic [Ca2+]i was increased, the systolic [Ca2+]i transients amplitude were depressed and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load was reduced. These effects were correlated to a decrease in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, Ucn applied at reperfusion produced a complete recovery in diastolic [Ca2+]i and global [Ca2+]i transient amplitude, which were due to NCX activity improvement. In conclusion, we demonstrated that [Ca2+]i handling play an essential role in postconditioning action of Ucn.

Abstract: Summary
The innate immune-signaling kinase, TBK1, couples pathogen surveillance to induction of host defense mechanisms. Pathological activation of TBK1 in cancer can overcome programmed cell death cues, enabling cells to survive oncogenic stress. The mechanistic basis of TBK1 prosurvival signaling, however, has been enigmatic. Here, we show that TBK1 directly activates AKT by phosphorylation of the canonical activation loop and hydrophobic motif sites independently of PDK1 and mTORC2. Upon mitogen stimulation, triggering of the innate immune response, re-exposure to glucose, or oncogene activation, TBK1 is recruited to the exocyst, where it activates AKT. In cells lacking TBK1, insulin activates AKT normally, but AKT activation by exocyst-dependent mechanisms is impaired. Discovery and characterization of a 6-aminopyrazolopyrimidine derivative, as a selective low-nanomolar TBK1 inhibitor, indicates that this regulatory arm can be pharmacologically perturbed independently of canonical PI3K/PDK1 signaling. Thus, AKT is a direct TBK1 substrate that connects TBK1 to prosurvival signaling.

Abstract: Summary
We show that in melanoma cells oncogenic BRAF, acting through MEK and the transcription factor BRN2, downregulates the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE5A. Although PDE5A downregulation causes a small decrease in proliferation, its major impact is to stimulate a dramatic increase in melanoma cell invasion. This is because PDE5A downregulation leads to an increase in cGMP, which induces an increase in cytosolic Ca2+, stimulating increased contractility and inducing invasion. PDE5A downregulation also this leads to an increase in short-term and long-term colonization of the lungs by melanoma cells. We do not observe this pathway in NRAS mutant melanoma or BRAF mutant colorectal cells. Thus, we show that in melanoma cells oncogenic BRAF induces invasion through downregulation of PDE5A.

Abstract: Summary
Specific information about how telomerase acts in vivo is necessary for understanding telomere dynamics in human tumor cells. Our results imply that, under homeostatic telomere length-maintenance conditions, only one molecule of telomerase acts at each telomere during every cell division and processively adds ∼60 nt to each end. In contrast, multiple molecules of telomerase act at each telomere when telomeres are elongating (nonequilibrium conditions). Telomerase extension is less processive during the first few weeks following the reversal of long-term treatment with the telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat (GRN163L), a time when Cajal bodies fail to deliver telomerase RNA to telomeres. This result implies that processing of telomerase by Cajal bodies may affect its processivity. Overexpressed telomerase is also less processive than the endogenously expressed telomerase. These findings reveal two major distinct extension modes adopted by telomerase in vivo.

Abstract: The structural features of eggs of Zorotypus caudelli Karny are described in detail. The egg is elliptic with long and short diameters of 0.6 and 0.3mm respectively, and creamy white. The egg shows a honeycomb pattern on its surface, without any specialized structures for hatching such as an operculum or a hatching line. The fringe formed by a fibrillar substance secreted after the completion of the chorion encircles the lateral surface. The egg layer is composed of an exochorion, an endochorion, and a vitelline envelope. The exochorion and endochorion are electron-dense and homogeneous in structure. The exochorion shows a perforation of numerous branching aeropyles. The exo- and endochorion are connected by numerous small columnar structures derived from the latter. The vitelline envelope is very thin and more electron-dense than the chorion. A pair of micropyles is present at the equator on the dorsal side of the egg. Originating at the micropyle, the micropylar canal runs through the chorion obliquely. The structural features of the eggs of Zoraptera were compared with those of other polyneopteran and paraneopteran orders.

Abstract: Summary
Expression of the Myc oncoprotein is downregulated in response to stress signals to allow cells to cease proliferation and escape apoptosis, but the mechanisms involved in this process are poorly understood. Cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage requires downregulation of Myc via a p53-independent signaling pathway. Here we have used siRNA screening of the human kinome to identify MAPKAPK5 (MK5, PRAK) as a negative regulator of Myc expression. MK5 regulates translation of Myc, since it is required for expression of miR-34b and miR-34c that bind to the 3′UTR of MYC. MK5 activates miR-34b/c expression via phosphorylation of FoxO3a, thereby promoting nuclear localization of FoxO3a and enabling it to induce miR-34b/c expression and arrest proliferation. Expression of MK5 in turn is directly activated by Myc, forming a negative feedback loop. MK5 is downregulated in colon carcinomas, arguing that this feedback loop is disrupted during colorectal tumorigenesis.

Abstract: The effectiveness of an apoptosis-targeting therapy may be limited in tumor cells with defects in apoptosis. Recently, considerable attention in the field of cancer therapy has been focused on the mammalian rapamycin target (mTOR), inhibition of which results in autophagic cell death. In our study using multidrug-resistant v-Ha-ras-transformed NIH3T3 (Ras-NIH 3T3/Mdr) cells, we demonstrated that rapamycin-induced cell death may result from 2 different mechanisms. At high rapamycin concentrations (≥ 100 nM), cell death may occur via an autophagy-dependent pathway, whereas at lower concentrations (≤ 10 nM), cell death may occur after G1-phase cell cycle arrest. This effect was accompanied by upregulation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 expression via an autophagy-independent pathway. We also tested whether inhibition of mTOR with low concentrations of rapamycin and ectopic Beclin-1 expression would further sensitize multidrug resistance (MDR)-positive cancer cells by upregulating autophagy. Rapamycin at low concentrations might be insufficient to initiate autophagosome formation in autophagy but Beclin-1 overexpression triggered additional processes downstream of mTOR during G1 cell cycle arrest by rapamycin. Our findings suggest that these combination strategies targeting autophagic cell death may yield significant benefits for cancer patients, because lowering rapamycin concentration for cancer treatment minimizes its side effects in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
In parallel with evolutionary developments, the Hsp90 molecular chaperone system shifted from a simple prokaryotic factor into an expansive network that includes a variety of cochaperones. We have taken high-throughput genomic and proteomic approaches to better understand the abundant yeast p23 cochaperone Sba1. Our work revealed an unexpected p23 network that displayed considerable independence from known Hsp90 clients. Additionally, our data uncovered a broad nuclear role for p23, contrasting with the historical dogma of restricted cytosolic activities for molecular chaperones. Validation studies demonstrated that yeast p23 was required for proper Golgi function and ribosome biogenesis, and was necessary for efficient DNA repair from a wide range of mutagens. Notably, mammalian p23 had conserved roles in these pathways as well as being necessary for proper cell mobility. Taken together, our work demonstrates that the p23 chaperone serves a broad physiological network and functions both in conjunction with and sovereign to Hsp90.

Abstract: Summary
The Dpp and Fat-Hippo signaling pathways both regulate growth in Drosophila. Dpp is a BMP family ligand and acts via a Smad family DNA-binding transcription factor, Mad. Fat-Hippo signaling acts via a non-DNA-binding transcriptional coactivator protein, Yorkie. Here, we show that these pathways are directly interlinked. They act synergistically to promote growth, in part via regulation of the microRNA gene bantam, and their ability to promote growth is mutually dependent. Yorkie and Mad physically bind each other, and we identify a 410 bp minimal enhancer of bantam that responds to Yorkie:Mad in vivo and in cultured cells, and show that both Yorkie and Mad associate with this enhancer in vivo. Our results indicate that in promoting the growth of Drosophila tissues, Fat-Hippo and Dpp signaling contribute distinct subunits of a shared transcriptional activation complex, Yorkie:Mad.

Abstract: The expression of 4-1BB has been known to be dependent on T cell activation. Recent studies have, however, revealed that 4-1BB expression is not restricted to T cells. We sought to determine the molecular basis for the differential gene expression. Here we report the expression pattern of two mouse 4-1BB transcripts, type I and type II. Whereas the type I transcript was specifically expressed on immune organ as previously reported, the type II transcript was ubiquitously expressed in tissues and various cell lines. However, both type I and type II transcript were highly induced on activated T cells. Primer extension assay of the two 4-1BB transcripts suggested that mouse 4-1BB had more than two transcripts. Using luciferase assay we have identified three promoter regions (PI, PII and PIII), which located on upstream region of second exon 1, first exon 1, and exon 2, respectively. In particular, the type I transcript was preferentially induced when naïve T cells are stimulated by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) since NF-κB specifically binds to the putative NF-κB element of PI. We have also shown that a splice variant, in which the transmembrane domain was deleted, could inhibit 4-1BB signaling. The splicing variant was highly induced by TCR stimulation. Our results reveal 4-1BB also has a negative regulation system through soluble 4-1BB produced from a splice variant induced under activation conditions.

Abstract: Cell death is an important process of plant responses to development and biotic/abiotic stresses. In rice plants, PBZ1, a PR10 family protein, has been shown to accumulate in tissues undergoing cell death. However, the function of PBZ1 in cell death remains yet to be demonstrated. Here, we report that exogenous recombinant PBZ1 protein induces cell death in rice suspension-cultured cells (SCCs) and also in leaves of Nicotiana tabacum in a dosedependent manner. This finding was confirmed in vivo in transgenic Arabidopsis lines harboring the PBZ1 gene under the control of a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible promoter. The DEX-treated leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis induced expression of PBZ1 at transcript and protein levels and showed cell death morphology. TUNEL analysis detected DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of programmed cell death, in rice SCCs treated with the PBZ1 protein. Recombinant PBZ1 protein also exhibited RNase activity and exhibited internalization inside BY-2 cells. Taken together, PBZ1 induces cell death not only in rice, but also in tobacco and Arabidopsis via its RNase activity inside the cell. PBZ1 could be used as a marker to understand the mechanism by which PBZ1 confers the cell death morphology in rice and other model plants.

Abstract: Summary
ARTS (apoptosis-related protein in the TGF-β signaling pathway) is a mitochondrial protein that binds XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) upon entering the cytosol, thus promoting cell death. Expression of ARTS is lost in some malignancies. Here, we show that ARTS binds to XIAP at BIR1, a domain distinct from the caspase-binding sites. Furthermore, ARTS interacts with the E3 ligase Siah-1 (seven in absentia homolog 1) to induce ubiquitination and degradation of XIAP. Cells lacking either Siah or ARTS contain higher steady-state levels of XIAP. Thus, ARTS serves as an adaptor to bridge Siah-1 to XIAP, targeting it for destruction.

Abstract: Angiotensin II (AngII) has been implicated in the mechanism of atrial fibrillation (AF). There may be calcium-dependent pro-fibrillatory effect of AngII on atrial myocytes. We used cultured confluent HL-1 atrial myocyte monolayer with spontaneously propagated depolarization to study direct pro-fibrillatory effect of AngII and its molecular mechanism. AngII stimulation induced fibrillatory-like complex electrogram and calcium wave propagation. AngII shortened action potential duration and augmented calcium transient, thus increasing electrochemical gradient of forward-mode sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) current and induced frequent irregular afterdepolarizations. AngII increased expression of sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), further increasing calcium-membrane voltage coupling gain. The fibrillatory effect of AngII was attenuated by NCX blocker SEA0400 and NCX siRNA knockdown. AngII increased expression of L-type calcium channel and augmented calcium transient through PKC and CREB. The fibrillatory effect of AngII was also attenuated by PKC inhibitor chelerythrine and dominant negative form of CREB. In conclusions, AngII itself may electrically contribute to the mechanism of AF through increasing NCX expression and augmenting calcium transient, which is PKC and CREB dependent. Specific genetic knockdown of NCX attenuated calcium mediated afterdepolarization and complex electrogram.

Abstract: Summary
Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are hedgehog-driven tumors that resemble follicular and interfollicular epidermal basal keratinocytes and hence long have been thought to arise from these cells. However, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Using cell fate tracking of X-ray induced BCCs in Ptch1+/− mice, we found their essentially exclusive origin to be keratin 15-expressing stem cells of the follicular bulge. However, conditional loss of p53 not only enhanced BCC carcinogenesis from the bulge but also produced BCCs from the interfollicular epidermis, at least in part by enhancing Smo expression. This latter finding is consistent with the lack of visible tumors on ears and tail, sites lacking Smo expression, in Ptch1+/− mice.

Abstract: Summary
Circadian rhythms are regulated by a synchronized system of central and peripheral clocks. Here, we show that a clock in the Drosophila fat body drives rhythmic expression of genes involved in metabolism, detoxification, the immune response, and steroid hormone regulation. Some of these genes cycle even when the fat body clock is disrupted, indicating that they are regulated by exogenous factors. Food is an important stimulus, as limiting food availability to a 6 hr interval each day drives rhythmic expression of genes in the fat body. Restricting food to a time of day when consumption is typically low desynchronizes internal rhythms because it alters the phase of rhythmic gene expression in the fat body without affecting the brain clock. Flies maintained on this paradigm produce fewer eggs than those restricted to food at the normal time. These data suggest that desynchrony of endogenous rhythms, caused by aberrant feeding patterns, affects reproductive fitness.

Abstract: Cardiac stem cells (CSCs) can differentiate into cardiac phenotypes representing early cardiomyocyte-like cells. However, CSCs-derived specification into sinus nodal cells is rarely known. Using the demethylating agent, 5-Aazacytidine (5-Aza), we tried to follow the process of cardiac specialization into sinus node-like cells. The c-kit+ cells were isolated from 1-month-old rat hearts and sorted by a flow cytometry cell sorting system. Then, analyses of immunofluorescence and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed on the cells. The sorted c-kit+ cell are self-renewing and clonogenic. Some of the c-kit+ cell could spontaneously express GATA-4, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), smooth muscle actin (SMA) and CD31. At week 8, the cells treated with 10μM 5-Aza expressed GATA-4 and cTnI at rates of 31.4±2.6% and 32.6±8.5%. Correspondingly, the rates were 21.4±8.1% and 18.7±4.3% in the cells without 5-Aza. The difference of GATA-4 or cTnI expression rate between two groups was of significance respectively, P<0.05. The cultured cells could express mRNA of GATA4, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 2 (HCN2) and HCN4. The mRNA expression was also up-regulated in cells treated with 10μM 5-Aza and growth factors. By week 2 after cell sorting, inward currents could be recorded in a fraction of the cultured cells. In conclusion, 10μM 5-Aza could promote the differentiation of c-kit+ cells into sinus node-like cells. 5-Aza-mediated differentiation seems to be helpful in future cell therapy for the patients suffering from loss of sinus node cells.

Abstract: Summary
Postreplication repair (PRR) pathways play important roles in restarting stalled replication forks and regulating mutagenesis. In yeast, Rad5-mediated damage avoidance and Rad18-mediated translesion synthesis (TLS) are two forms of PRR. Two Rad5-related proteins, SHPRH and HLTF, have been identified in mammalian cells, but their specific roles in PRR are unclear. Here, we show that HLTF and SHPRH suppress mutagenesis in a damage-specific manner, preventing mutations induced by UV and MMS, respectively. Following UV, HLTF enhances PCNA monoubiquitination and recruitment of TLS polymerase η, while also inhibiting SHPRH function. In contrast, MMS promotes the degradation of HLTF and the interactions of SHPRH with Rad18 and polymerase κ. Our data suggest not only that cells differentially utilize HLTF and SHPRH for different forms of DNA damage, but also, surprisingly, that HLTF and SHPRH may coordinate the two main branches of PRR to choose the proper bypass mechanism for minimizing mutagenesis.

Abstract: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) plays various roles in cell growth in different cell types. However, few studies have focused on TIMP-1’s effect on fibroblast cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of TIMP-1 overexpression on NIH3T3 fibroblast proliferation and potential transduction signaling pathways involved. Overexpression of TIMP-1, by transfection of the pLenti6/V5-DESTTIMP-1 plasmid, significantly promoted NIH3T3 proliferation as determined by the BrdU array. Neither 5 nor 15 nM GM6001 (matrix metalloproteinase system inhibitor) affected NIH3T3 proliferation, but 45 nM GM6001 inhibited proliferation. TIMP-1 overexpression activated the p-Akt pathway, but not the p-ERK or p-p38 pathway. In TIMP-1-transfected cells, cyclinD1 was upregulated and p21CIP1 and p27KIP1 were downregulated, which promoted cell entry into the S and G2/M phases. The PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 abolished the TIMP-1-induced effects. Overexpression of intracellular TIMP-1 stimulated NIH3T3 fibroblast proliferation in a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-independent manner by activating the p-Akt pathway and related cell cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic regulation of gene expression by histone-modifying corepressor complexes is central to normal animal development. The NAD+-dependent deacetylase and gene repressor SIRT1 removes histone H4K16 acetylation marks and facilitates heterochromatin formation. However, the mechanistic contribution of SIRT1 to epigenetic regulation at euchromatic loci and whether it acts in concert with other chromatin-modifying activities to control developmental gene expression programs remain unclear. We describe here a SIRT1 corepressor complex containing the histone H3K4 demethylase LSD1/KDM1A and several other LSD1-associated proteins. SIRT1 and LSD1 interact directly and play conserved and concerted roles in H4K16 deacetylation and H3K4 demethylation to repress genes regulated by the Notch signaling pathway. Mutations in Drosophila SIRT1 and LSD1 orthologs result in similar developmental phenotypes and genetically interact with the Notch pathway in Drosophila. These findings offer new insights into conserved mechanisms of epigenetic gene repression and regulation of development by SIRT1 in metazoans.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA-binding protein Sam68 is implicated in various cellular processes including RNA metabolism, apoptosis, and signal transduction. Here we identify a role of Sam68 in TNF-induced NF-κB activation and apoptosis. We found that Sam68 is recruited to the TNF receptor, and its deficiency dramatically reduces RIP recruitment and ubiquitylation. It also impairs cIAP1 recruitment and maintenance of recruited TRAF2 at the TNF receptor. In its absence, activation of the TAK1-IKK kinase complex is defective, greatly reducing signal transduction. Sam68 is also found as a part of the TNF-induced cytoplasmic caspase-8-FADD complex. RIP is not recruited to this complex in Sam68 knockout cells, and caspase activation is virtually absent. These findings delineate previously unknown functions for Sam68 in the TNF signaling pathway, where it acts as a signaling adaptor both in the membrane-associated complex I and in the cytoplasmic complex II, regulating both NF-κB activation and apoptosis.

Abstract: Ginsenosides, active ingredients of Panax ginseng, are known to exhibit neuroprotective effects. Large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+(BKca) channels are key modulators of cellular excitability of neurons and vascular smooth muscle cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of ginsenosides on rat brain BKca (rSlo) channel activity heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes to elucidate the molecular mechanisms how ginsenoside regulates the BKca channel activity. Ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3) enhanced outward BKca channel currents. The Rg3-enhancement of outward BKca channel currents was concentration-dependent, voltage-dependent, and reversible. The EC50 was 15.1±3.1μM. Rg3 actions were not desensitized by repeated treatment. Tetraetylammonium (TEA), a K+channel blocker, inhibited BKca channel currents. We examined whether extracellular TEA treatment could alter the Rg3 action and vice versa. TEA caused a rightward shift of the Rg3 concentration-response curve (i.e., much higher concentration of Rg3 is required for the activation of BKca channel compared to the absence of TEA), while Rg3 caused a rightward shift of the TEA concentration-response curve in wild-type channels. Mutation of the extracellular TEA binding site Y360 to Y360I caused a rightward shift of the TEA concentration-response curve and almost abolished both the Rg3 action and Rg3-induced rightward shift of TEA concentration-response curve. These results indicate that Tyr360 residue of BKca channel plays an important role in the Rg3-enhancement of BKca channel currents.

Abstract: Summary
Processive reactions, such as transcription or translation, often proceed through distinct initiation and elongation phases. The processive formation of polymeric ubiquitin chains can accordingly be catalyzed by specialized initiating and elongating E2 enzymes, but the functional significance for this division of labor has remained unclear. Here, we have identified sequence motifs in several substrates of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) that are required for efficient chain initiation by its E2 Ube2C. Differences in the quality and accessibility of these chain initiation motifs can determine the rate of a substrate's degradation without affecting its affinity for the APC/C, a mechanism used by the APC/C to control the timing of substrate proteolysis during the cell cycle. Based on our results, we propose that initiation motifs and their cognate E2s allow E3 enzymes to exert precise temporal control over substrate degradation.

Abstract: Summary
The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF20 regulates chromatin structure by monoubiquitinating histone H2B in transcription. Here, we show that RNF20 is localized to double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) independently of H2AX and is required for the DSB-induced H2B ubiquitination. In addition, RNF20 is required for the methylation of H3K4 at DSBs and the recruitment of the chromatin-remodeling factor SNF2h. Depletion of RNF20, depletion of SNF2h, or expression of the H2B mutant lacking the ubiquitination site (K120R) compromises resection of DNA ends and recruitment of RAD51 and BRCA1. Consequently, cells lacking RNF20 or SNF2h and cells expressing H2B K120R exhibit pronounced defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR) and enhanced sensitivity to radiation. Finally, the function of RNF20 in HRR can be partially bypassed by forced chromatin relaxation. Thus, the RNF20-mediated H2B ubiquitination at DSBs plays a critical role in HRR through chromatin remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarization is essential throughout development for proliferation, migration, and differentiation. However, it is not known how extracellular cues correctly orient cell polarity at distinct stages of development. Here, we show that the endocytic adaptor protein Numb, previously characterized for its role in cell proliferation, subsequently plays an important role in cell migration. In neural precursors stimulated with the chemotactic factor BDNF, Numb binds to activated TrkB, the BDNF receptor, and functions both as an endocytic regulator for TrkB and as a scaffold for aPKC (aPKC). Thus, Numb promotes BDNF-dependent aPKC activation. Interestingly, Numb is also a substrate of aPKC. When phosphorylated, Numb exhibits increased efficacy in binding TrkB and in promoting a chemotactic response to BDNF. Therefore, Numb functions in a feed-forward loop to promote chemotaxis of neural precursors, linking BDNF, an extracellular cue, to aPKC, a critical component of the intrinsic polarity machinery.

Abstract: Immunophilins are receptors for immunosuppressive drugs such as the macrolides cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506; correspondingly these immunophilins are referred to as cyclophilins and FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs). In particular, CsA targets cyclophilin D (CypD), which can modulate mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics. Since mitochondria have been implicated in the regulation of astrocytic cytosolic Ca2+ (Cacyt2+) dynamics and consequential Ca2+-dependent exocytotic release of glutamate, we investigated the role of CypD in this process. Cortical astrocytes isolated from CypD deficient mice Ppif −/− displayed reduced mechanically induced Cacyt2+ increases, even though these cells showed augmented exocytotic release of glutamate, when compared to responses obtained from astrocytes isolated from wild-type mice. Furthermore, acute treatment with CsA to inhibit CypD modulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering, or with FK506 to inhibit FKBP12 interaction with inositol-trisphosphate receptor of the endoplasmic reticulum, led to similar reductive effects on astrocytic Cacyt2+ dynamics, but also to an enhanced Ca2+-dependent exocytotic release of glutamate in wild-type astrocytes. These findings point to a possible role of immunophilin signal transduction pathways in astrocytic modulation of neuronal activity at the tripartite synapse.

Abstract: Summary
Adult pancreatic β cells can replicate during growth and after injury to maintain glucose homeostasis. Here, we report that β cells deficient in Dnmt1, an enzyme that propagates DNA methylation patterns during cell division, were converted to α cells. We identified the lineage determination gene aristaless-related homeobox (Arx), as methylated and repressed in β cells, and hypomethylated and expressed in α cells and Dnmt1-deficient β cells. We show that the methylated region of the Arx locus in β cells was bound by methyl-binding protein MeCP2, which recruited PRMT6, an enzyme that methylates histone H3R2 resulting in repression of Arx. This suggests that propagation of DNA methylation during cell division also ensures recruitment of enzymatic machinery capable of modifying and transmitting histone marks. Our results reveal that propagation of DNA methylation during cell division is essential for repression of α cell lineage determination genes to maintain pancreatic β cell identity.

Abstract: Summary
Prostate cancer is characterized by its dependence on androgen receptor (AR) and frequent activation of PI3K signaling. We find that AR transcriptional output is decreased in human and murine tumors with PTEN deletion and that PI3K pathway inhibition activates AR signaling by relieving feedback inhibition of HER kinases. Similarly, AR inhibition activates AKT signaling by reducing levels of the AKT phosphatase PHLPP. Thus, these two oncogenic pathways cross-regulate each other by reciprocal feedback. Inhibition of one activates the other, thereby maintaining tumor cell survival. However, combined pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K and AR signaling caused near-complete prostate cancer regressions in a Pten-deficient murine prostate cancer model and in human prostate cancer xenografts, indicating that both pathways coordinately support survival.

Abstract: This study performed a large-scale, high-throughput analysis of transcriptional profiling of liver stellate cells (LSCs) at the cellular level to investigate changes in the biological activity of LSCs during rat liver regeneration (LR) and the relation of these changes to LR. First, a rat liver regeneration model was established by partial hepatectomy (PH). Stellate cells were isolated in high purity and yield from the regenerating rat liver by Percoll density gradient centrifugation and immunomagnetic bead sorting. The changes in gene expression of LSCs after PH were examined using a rat genome 230 2.0 array composed of 24622 genes. The results indicated that 10241 of the 24622 genes investigated on the array were differentially expressed in LSCs. Of the 10241 genes, 1563 known genes were related to LR, which were grouped into three major gene expression clusters according to three-fold cut-off threshold: the up-regulated gene cluster, the down-regulated gene cluster, and the cluster composed of genes showing complex changes in expression. Additionally, the genes were grouped into those involved in transcription regulation, signal transduction, transport, cellular metabolism, inflammation and immunity by functional analysis. When gene expression profiles were combined with the results of gene functional analysis, most of the genes involved in cytokine secretion and retinol metabolism in LSCs were significantly enriched in the cluster characterized by decreased expression, whereas genes involved in lipid metabolism were mostly enriched in the cluster showing increased expression. Based on further analysis of genes expressed in a phase-dependent manner during LR, it was suggested that lipid metabolism in LSCs was enhanced in the whole regeneration process, and that immune response and cytokine secretion were impaired during all three regenerative phases.

Abstract: Summary
Septins are GTP-binding proteins that form ordered, rod-like multimeric complexes and polymerize into filaments, but how such supramolecular structure is related to septin function was unclear. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, four septins form an apolar hetero-octamer (Cdc11-Cdc12-Cdc3-Cdc10-Cdc10-Cdc3-Cdc12-Cdc11) that associates end-to-end to form filaments. We show that septin filament assembly displays previously unanticipated plasticity. Cells lacking Cdc10 or Cdc11 are able to divide because the now-exposed subunits (Cdc3 or Cdc12, respectively) retain an ability to homodimerize via their so-called G interface, thereby allowing for filament assembly. In such cdc10Δ and cdc11Δ cells, the remaining septins, like wild-type complexes, localize to the cortex at the bud neck and compartmentalize nonseptin factors, consistent with a diffusion barrier composed of continuous filaments in intimate contact with the plasma membrane. Conversely, Cdc10 or Cdc11 mutants that cannot self-associate, but “cap” Cdc3 or Cdc12, respectively, prevent filament formation, block cortical localization, and kill cells.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular-level understanding of body weight control is essential for combating obesity. We show that female mice lacking tyrosine phosphatase epsilon (RPTPe) are protected from weight gain induced by high-fat food, ovariectomy, or old age and exhibit increased whole-body energy expenditure and decreased adiposity. RPTPe-deficient mice, in particular males, exhibit improved glucose homeostasis. Female nonobese RPTPe-deficient mice are leptin hypersensitive and exhibit reduced circulating leptin concentrations, suggesting that RPTPe inhibits hypothalamic leptin signaling in vivo. Leptin hypersensitivity persists in aged, ovariectomized, and high-fat-fed RPTPe-deficient mice, indicating that RPTPe helps establish obesity-associated leptin resistance. RPTPe associates with and dephosphorylates JAK2, thereby downregulating leptin receptor signaling. Leptin stimulation induces phosphorylation of hypothalamic RPTPe at its C-terminal Y695, which drives RPTPe to downregulate JAK2. RPTPe is therefore an inhibitor of hypothalamic leptin signaling in vivo, and provides controlled negative-feedback regulation of this pathway following its activation.

Abstract: Summary
In many prokaryotes, a specific DNA primase/polymerase (PolDom) is required for nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we report the crystal structure of a catalytically active conformation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis PolDom, consisting of a polymerase bound to a DNA end with a 3′ overhang, two metal ions, and an incoming nucleotide but, significantly, lacking a primer strand. This structure represents a polymerase:DNA complex in a preternary intermediate state. This polymerase complex occurs in solution, stabilizing the enzyme on DNA ends and promoting nucleotide extension of short incoming termini. We also demonstrate that the invariant Arg220, contained in a conserved loop (loop 2), plays an essential role in catalysis by regulating binding of a second metal ion in the active site. We propose that this NHEJ intermediate facilitates extension reactions involving critically short or noncomplementary DNA ends, thus promoting break repair and minimizing sequence loss during DSB repair.

Abstract: Summary
We have identified human MBT domain-containing protein L3MBTL2 as an integral component of a protein complex that we termed Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1)-like 4 (PRC1L4), given the copresence of PcG proteins RING1, RING2, and PCGF6/MBLR. PRC1L4 also contained E2F6 and CBX3/HP1γ, known to function in transcriptional repression. PRC1L4-mediated repression necessitated L3MBTL2 that compacted chromatin in a histone modification-independent manner. Genome-wide location analyses identified several hundred genes simultaneously bound by L3MBTL2 and E2F6, preferentially around transcriptional start sites that exhibited little overlap with those targeted by other E2Fs or by L3MBTL1, another MBT domain-containing protein that interacts with RB1. L3MBTL2-specific RNAi resulted in increased expression of target genes that exhibited a significant reduction in H2A lysine 119 monoubiquitination. Our findings highlight a PcG/MBT collaboration that attains repressive chromatin without entailing histone lysine methylation marks.

Abstract: We examined the mechanisms involved in the [Ca2+]i response to the extracellular hypotonicity in the principal cells of freshly isolated rat cortical collecting duct (CCD), using Fura-2/AM fluorescence imaging. Reduction of extracellular osmolality from 305 (control) to 195mosmol/kgH2O (hypotonic) evoked transient increase in [Ca2+]i of principal cells of rat CCDs. The [Ca2+]i increase was markedly attenuated by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. The application of a P2 purinoceptor antagonist, suramin failed to inhibit the hypotonicity-induced [Ca2+]i increase. The [Ca2+]i increase in response to extracellular hypotonicity was not influenced by application of Gd3+ and ruthenium red. On the other hand, a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel inhibitor, nicardipine, significantly reduced the peak amplitude of [Ca2+]i increase in the principal cells. In order to assess Ca2+ entry during the hypotonic stimulation, we measured the quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence intensity by Mn2+. The hypotonic stimulation enhanced quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence by Mn2+, indicating that a Ca2+-permeable pathway was activated by the hypotonicity. The hypotonicity-mediated enhancement of Mn2+ quenching was significantly inhibited by nicardipine. These results strongly suggested that a nicardipine-sensitive Ca2+ entry pathway would contribute to the mechanisms underlying the hypotonicity-induced [Ca2+]i elevation of principal cells in rat CCD.

Abstract: Summary
The relationships between normal and leukemic stem/progenitor cells are unclear. We show that in ∼80% of primary human CD34+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two expanded populations with hemopoietic progenitor immunophenotype coexist in most patients. Both populations have leukemic stem cell (LSC) activity and are hierarchically ordered; one LSC population gives rise to the other. Global gene expression profiling shows the LSC populations are molecularly distinct and resemble normal progenitors but not stem cells. The more mature LSC population most closely mirrors normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP) and the immature LSC population a previously uncharacterized progenitor functionally similar to lymphoid-primed multipotential progenitors (LMPPs). This suggests that in most cases primary CD34+ AML is a progenitor disease where LSCs acquire abnormal self-renewal potential.

Abstract: Summary
We employ single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to study structural dynamics over the first two elongation cycles of protein synthesis, using ribosomes containing either Cy3-labeled ribosomal protein L11 and A- or P-site Cy5-labeled tRNA or Cy3- and Cy5-labeled tRNAs. Pretranslocation (PRE) complexes demonstrate fluctuations between classical and hybrid forms, with concerted motions of tRNAs away from L11 and from each other when classical complex converts to hybrid complex. EF-G⋅GTP binding to both hybrid and classical PRE complexes halts these fluctuations prior to catalyzing translocation to form the posttranslocation (POST) complex. EF-G dependent translocation from the classical PRE complex proceeds via transient formation of a short-lived hybrid intermediate. A-site binding of either EF-G to the PRE complex or of aminoacyl-tRNA⋅EF-Tu ternary complex to the POST complex markedly suppresses ribosome conformational lability.

Abstract: Summary
Endocrine therapies for breast cancer that target the estrogen receptor (ER) are ineffective in the 25%–30% of cases that are ER negative (ER–). Androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in 60%–70% of breast tumors, independent of ER status. How androgens and AR regulate breast cancer growth remains largely unknown. We find that AR is enriched in ER– breast tumors that overexpress HER2. Through analysis of the AR cistrome and androgen-regulated gene expression in ER–/HER2+ breast cancers we find that AR mediates ligand-dependent activation of Wnt and HER2 signaling pathways through direct transcriptional induction of WNT7B and HER3. Specific targeting of AR, Wnt or HER2 signaling impairs androgen-stimulated tumor cell growth suggesting potential therapeutic approaches for ER–/HER2+ breast cancers.

Abstract: The process of mechanotransduction of bone, the conversion of a mechanical stimulus into a biochemical response, is known to occur in osteoblasts in response to fluid shear stress. In order to understand the reaction of osteoblasts to various times of flow perfusion, osteoblasts were seeded on three-dimensional scaffolds, and cultured in the following conditions: continuous flow perfusion, intermittent flow perfusion, and static condition. We collected samples on day 4, 8 and 12 for analysis. Osteoblast proliferation was demonstrated by cell proliferation and scanning electron microscopy assay. Additionally, the expression of known markers of differentiation, including alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, were tested by qRT-PCR and alkaline phosphatase activity assay, and the deposition of calcium was used as an indicator of mineralization demonstrated by calcium content assay. The results supported that low fluid shear stress plays an important role in the activation of osteoblasts: enhance cell proliferation, increase calcium deposition, and promote the expression of osteoblastic markers. Furthermore, the continuous flow perfusion is a more favorable environment for the initiation of osteoblast activity compared with intermittent flow perfusion. Therefore, the force and time of fluid shear stress are important parameters for osteoblast activation.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy, a catabolic pathway that delivers cellular components to lysosomes for degradation, can be activated by stressful conditions such as nutrient starvation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We report that thapsigargin, an ER stressor widely used to induce autophagy, in fact blocks autophagy. Thapsigargin does not affect autophagosome formation but leads to accumulation of mature autophagosomes by blocking autophagosome fusion with the endocytic system. Strikingly, thapsigargin has no effect on endocytosis-mediated degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor. Molecularly, while both Rab7 and Vps16 are essential regulatory components for endocytic fusion with lysosomes, we found that Rab7 but not Vps16 is required for complete autophagy flux, and that thapsigargin blocks recruitment of Rab7 to autophagosomes. Therefore, autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion must be governed by a distinct molecular mechanism compared to general endocytic fusion.

Abstract: Summary
Paget's disease (PD) is characterized by abnormal osteoclasts (OCL) that secrete high IL-6 levels and induce exuberant bone formation. Because measles virus nucleocapsid gene (MVNP) and the p62P392L mutation are implicated in PD, marrows from 12 PD patients harboring p62P392L and eight normals were tested for MVNP expression and pagetic OCL formation. Eight out of twelve patients expressed MVNP and formed pagetic OCL in vitro, which were inhibited by antisense-MVNP. Four out of twelve patients lacked MVNP and formed normal OCL that were hyperresponsive to RANKL but unaffected by antisense-MVNP. Similarly, mice expressing only p62P394L formed normal OCL, while mice expressing MVNP in OCL, with or without p62P394L, developed pagetic OCL and expressed high IL-6 levels dependent on p38MAPK activation. IL-6 deficiency in MVNP mice abrogated pagetic OCL development in vitro. Mice coexpressing MVNP and p62P394L developed dramatic Paget's-like bone lesions. These results suggest that p62P394L and IL-6 induction by MVNP play key roles in PD.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to monitor the nascent peptide structure and to respond functionally to specific nascent peptide sequences is a fundamental property of the ribosome. An extreme manifestation of such response is nascent peptide-dependent ribosome stalling, involved in the regulation of gene expression. The molecular mechanisms of programmed translation arrest are unclear. By analyzing ribosome stalling at the regulatory cistron of the antibiotic resistance gene ermA, we uncovered a carefully orchestrated cooperation between the ribosomal exit tunnel and the A-site of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) in halting translation. The presence of an inducing antibiotic and a specific nascent peptide in the exit tunnel abrogate the ability of the PTC to catalyze peptide bond formation with a particular subset of amino acids. The extent of the conferred A-site selectivity is modulated by the C-terminal segment of the nascent peptide, where the third-from-last residue plays a critical role.

Abstract: Summary
Lipotoxicity is a metabolic stress response implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes complications and has been shown to involve lipid-induced oxidative stress. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of lipotoxicity, we used retroviral promoter trap mutagenesis to isolate a cell line that is resistant to lipotoxic and oxidative stress. We show that loss of three box C/D small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) encoded in the ribosomal protein L13a (rpL13a) locus is sufficient to confer resistance to lipotoxic and oxidative stress in vitro and prevents the propagation of oxidative stress in vivo. Our results provide evidence for a previously unappreciated, non-canonical role for box C/D snoRNAs as regulators of metabolic stress response pathways in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Regulated adhesion between cells and their environment is critical for normal cell migration. We have identified mutations in a gene encoding the Drosophila hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-degrading enzyme Jafrac1, which lead to germ cell adhesion defects. During gastrulation, primordial germ cells (PGCs) associate tightly with the invaginating midgut primordium as it enters the embryo; however, in embryos from jafrac1 mutant mothers this association is disrupted, leaving some PGCs trailing on the outside of the embryo. We observed similar phenotypes in embryos from DE-cadherin/shotgun (shg) mutant mothers and were able to rescue the jafrac1 phenotype by increasing DE-cadherin levels. This and our biochemical evidence strongly suggest that Jafrac1-mediated reduction of H2O2 is required to maintain DE-cadherin protein levels in the early embryo. Our results present in vivo evidence of a peroxiredoxin regulating DE-cadherin-mediated adhesion.

Abstract: The superfamily of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) is vastly expanded in plants compared to other eukaryotes. A subfamily of RBPs that contain three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) from the Arabidopsis (24), rice (19) and poplar (37) genomes was analyzed in this study. Phylogenetic analysis with full-length protein sequences of 80 RBPs identified nine clades. The largest clade, comprising 23 members, showed high homology to human RBPs involved in oxidative signaling. Digital northern analysis revealed that Arabidopsis RBPs are transcriptionally responsive to biotic, abiotic and hormonal treatments. Northern blot analysis of eight Arabidopsis RBPs belonging to the tobacco RBP45/47 family showed that these genes respond to ozone stress. AtRBP45b, which shows closest homology to the yeast oxidative stress regulatory protein, CSX1, was expressed in multiple tissues. Two novel splice variant forms of AtRBP45b were identified by 3’RACE analysis. Based on RT-PCR, splice variant AtRBP45b-SV1 was observed only in response to mechanical wounding caused by pathogen or chemical infiltrations and was not detectable in response to salt or temperature stress. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that recombinant full-length and splice variant forms of AtRBP45b bound synthetic RNA. Identifying in vivo RNA targets of AtRBP45b will aid in determining the precise functional role of these proteins during oxidative signaling.

Abstract: Endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complexes are involved in endosomal trafficking to the lysosome, cytokinesis, and viral budding. Extensive genetic, biochemical, and structural studies on the ESCRT system have been carried out in yeast and mammalian systems. However, the question of how the ESCRT system functions at the whole organism level has not been fully explored. In C. elegans, we performed RNAi experiments to knock-down gene expression of components of the ESCRT system and profiled their effects on protein degradation and endocytosis of YP170, a yolk protein. Targeted RNAi knock-down of ESCRT-I (tsg-101 and vps-28) and ESCRT-III (vps-24, and vps-32.2) components interfered with protein degradation while knock-down of ESCRT-II (vps-25 and vps-36) and ESCRT-III (vps-20 and vps-24) components hampered endocytosis. In contrast, the knockdown of vps-37, another ESCRT-I component, showed no defect in either YP170 uptake or degradation. Depletion of at least one component from each complex - ESCRT-0 (hgrs-1), ESCRT-I (tsg-101, vps-28, and vps-37), ESCRT-II (vps-36), ESCRT-III (vps-24), and Vps4 (vps-4) - resulted in abnormal distribution of embryos in the uterus of worms, possibly due to abnormal ovulation, fertilization, and egglaying. These results suggest differential physiological roles of ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III complexes in the context of the whole organism, C. elegans.

Abstract: Summary
CD44 is an adhesion molecule expressed in cancer stem-like cells. Here, we show that a CD44 variant (CD44v) interacts with xCT, a glutamate-cystine transporter, and controls the intracellular level of reduced glutathione (GSH). Human gastrointestinal cancer cells with a high level of CD44 expression showed an enhanced capacity for GSH synthesis and defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ablation of CD44 induced loss of xCT from the cell surface and suppressed tumor growth in a transgenic mouse model of gastric cancer. It also induced activation of p38MAPK, a downstream target of ROS, and expression of the gene for the cell cycle inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1. These findings establish a function for CD44v in regulation of ROS defense and tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
The Twist1 transcription factor is known to promote tumor metastasis and induce Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Here, we report that Twist1 is capable of promoting the formation of invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions for extracellular matrix degradation. Twist1 induces PDGFRα expression, which in turn activates Src, to promote invadopodia formation. We show that Twist1 and PDGFRα are central mediators of invadopodia formation in response to various EMT-inducing signals. Induction of PDGFRα and invadopodia is essential for Twist1 to promote tumor metastasis. Consistent with PDGFRα being a direct transcriptional target of Twist1, coexpression of Twist1 and PDGFRα predicts poor survival in breast tumor patients. Therefore, invadopodia-mediated matrix degradation is a key function of Twist1 in promoting tumor metastasis.

Abstract: Glucose addition to glucose-starved Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells triggers a quick and transient influx of calcium from the extracellular environment. In yeast at least two different carrier systems were identified: a high affinity system, requiring Cch1 channel, and a low affinity system. Here we report that another calcium transport system exists in yeast, not yet identified, that can substitute the two known systems when they are inactivated. This system was called GIC (for Glucose Induced Calcium) system and it is a high affinity calcium transport system, magnesium-sensitive but nickel-resistant. Moreover, GIC transport is sensitive to gadolinium and nifedipine, but it is not sensitive to inhibition by verapamil, which conversely behaves as an agonist on glucose response. GIC transport is fully functional in conditions when calcineurin is active, a serine/threonine specificity phosphatase involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and in many other cellular phenomena such as tolerance to high concentrations of Na+ and Li+, response to pheromones and gene transcription regulation. Here it is reported for the first time that calcineurin can also be activated by nutrients: the activation of Crz1 transcription factor by calcineurin was observed in derepressed cells after addition of glucose in the presence of extracellular calcium.

Abstract: Reduced sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2) contributes to the impaired cardiomyocyte Ca2+ homeostasis observed in heart failure. We hypothesized that a reduction in SERCA2 also elicits myocardial ER/SR stress responses, including unfolded protein responses (UPR) and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which may additionally contribute to the pathophysiology of this condition. Left ventricular myocardium from mice with cardiomyocyte-specific tamoxifen-inducible disruption of Serca2 (SERCA2 KO) was compared with aged-matched controls. In SERCA2 KO hearts, SERCA2 protein levels were markedly reduced to 2% of control values at 7 weeks following tamoxifen treatment. Serca2 disruption caused increased abundance of the ER stress-associated proteins CRT, GRP78, PERK, and eIF2α and increased phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2α, indicating UPR induction. Pro-apoptotic signaling was also activated in SERCA2 KO, as the abundance of CHOP, caspase 12, and Bax was increased. Indeed, TUNEL staining revealed an increased fraction of cardiomyocytes undergoing apoptosis in SERCA2 KO. ER-Tracker staining additionally revealed altered ER structure. These findings indicate that reduction in SERCA2 protein abundance is associated with marked ER/SR stress in cardiomyocytes, which induces UPR, apoptosis, and ER/SR structural alterations. This suggests that reduced SERCA2 abundance or function may contribute to the phenotype of heart failure also through induction of ER/SR stress responses.

Abstract: Summary
All organisms have devised strategies to counteract energy depletion and promote fitness for survival. We show here that cellular energy depletion puts into play a surprising strategy that leads to absorption of exogenous fuel for energy repletion. The energy-depletion-sensing kinase AMPK binds, phosphorylates, and activates the transcriptional coactivator SRC-2, which in a liver-specific manner promotes absorption of dietary fat from the gut. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of SRC-2 results in intestinal fat malabsorption and attenuated entry of fat into the blood stream. This defect can be attributed to AMPK- and SRC-2-mediated transcriptional regulation of hepatic bile acid (BA) secretion into the gut, as it can be completely rescued by replenishing intestinal BA or by genetically restoring the levels of hepatic bile salt export pump (BSEP). Our results position the hepatic AMPK-SRC-2 axis as an energy rheostat, which upon cellular energy depletion resets whole-body energy by promoting absorption of dietary fuel.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise has been shown to be effective for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms for adaptation to exercise training are not fully understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been linked to metabolic dysfunction. Here we show that the unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive response pathway that maintains ER homeostasis upon luminal stress, is activated in skeletal muscle during exercise and adapts skeletal muscle to exercise training. The transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which regulates several exercise-associated aspects of skeletal muscle function, mediates the UPR in myotubes and skeletal muscle through coactivation of ATF6α. Efficient recovery from acute exercise is compromised in ATF6α−/− mice. Blocking ER-stress-related cell death via deletion of CHOP partially rescues the exercise intolerance phenotype in muscle-specific PGC-1α KO mice. These findings suggest that modulation of the UPR through PGC1α represents an alternative avenue to improve skeletal muscle function and achieve metabolic benefits.

Abstract: Summary
Although a growing body of evidence supports that Wnt-Frizzled signaling controls axon guidance from vertebrates to worms, whether and how this is mediated by planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling remain elusive. We show here that the core PCP components are required for Wnt5a-stimulated outgrowth and anterior-posterior guidance of commissural axons. Dishevelled1 can inhibit PCP signaling by increasing hyperphosphorylation of Frizzled3 and preventing its internalization. Vangl2 antagonizes that by reducing Frizzled3 phosphorylation and promotes its internalization. In commissural axon growth cones, Vangl2 is predominantly localized on the plasma membrane and is highly enriched on the tips of the filopodia as well as in patches of membrane where new filopodia emerge. Taken together, we propose that the antagonistic functions of Vangl2 and Dvl1 (over Frizzled3 hyperphosphorylation and endocytosis) allow sharpening of PCP signaling locally on the tips of the filopodia to sense directional cues, Wnts, eventually causing turning of growth cones.

Abstract: Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is an essential mediator in diabetic vascular lesions and known to be regulated by activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). The aim of this study was to investigate whether CaMKII affects iNOS-mediated pericyte death in the retina of diabetic mice with early stage disease. Totalandphospho-CaMKII, iNOS, and active caspase-3 protein levels were assessed by Western blotting, and CaMKII activity was measured by kinase assay. iNOS-relatedpericyte death was assessed by double immunofluorescent staining for iNOS and α-smooth muscle actin, followed by the TUNEL assay. Autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (AIP), a specific inhibitor of CaMKII, was injected into the right vitreous 2 days before sacrifice of mice, to examine the effect of CaMKII inactivation in diabetic retinas. The levels of total- and phospho-CaMKII, iNOS, and active caspase-3 protein, and CaMKII activity were significantly increased in the diabetic retinas compared with those of control retinas. Furthermore, TUNEL-positive signals colocalized with iNOS-immunoreactivepericytes in the same retinas. However, inactivation of CaMKII by AIP treatment inhibited all these changes, which was accompanied by less pericyte loss. Our results demonstrate that CaMKII contributes to iNOS-related death of pericytes in the diabetic retina and that inactivation of this enzyme may be a potential treatment for retinal vascular lesion.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine if podoplanin was expressed by rudiment chondrocytes in human foetal cartilages. Podoplanin was immunolocalised in first trimester human foetal rib and knee joint rudiments to a sub-population of chondrocytes deep in the rib rudiments, tibial and femoral growth plates and cells associated with the cartilage canals of the foetal knee joint rudiments. Lymphatic vessels in the loose stromal tissues surrounding the developing rudiments were also demonstrated on the same histology slides using antipodoplanin (MAb D2-40) and anti-LYVE-1 and differentiated from CD-31 positive blood vessels confirming the discriminative capability of the antibody preparations used. The D2-40 positive rib and knee rudiment chondrocytes were not stained with antibodies to LYVE-1, CD-31 or CD-34 however perlecan was a prominent pericellular proteoglycan around these cells confirming their chondrogenic phenotype. Discernable differences were evident between the surface and deep rudiment chondrocytes in terms of their antigen reactivities detected with MAb D2-40 or antiperlecan antibodies. Binding of the cytoplasmic tail of PDPN to the ERM proteins ezrin, radixin and moeisin may result in changes in cytoskeletal organisation which alter the phenotype of this central population of rudiment cells. This may contribute to morphological changes in the rudiment cartilages which lead to establishment of the primary ossification centres and is consistent with their roles as transient developmental scaffolds during tissue development.

Abstract: Summary
Deregulated oncogenes such as MYC and RAS are typically insufficient to transform cells on their own due to the activation of pathways that restrain proliferation. Previous studies have shown that oncogenic H-Ras can induce proliferative arrest or senescence, depending on the cellular context. Here, we show that deregulated H-Ras activity can also lead to caspase-independent cell death with features of autophagy. Ras-induced autophagy was associated with upregulation of the BH3-only protein Noxa as well as the autophagy regulator Beclin-1. Silencing of Noxa or Beclin-1 expression reduced Ras-induced autophagy and increased clonogenic survival. Ras-induced cell death was also inhibited by coexpression of Bcl-2 family members that inhibit Beclin-1 function. Ras-induced autophagy was associated with Noxa-mediated displacement of the Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1, from Beclin-1. Thus, Ras-induced expression of Noxa and Beclin-1 promotes autophagic cell death, which represents a mechanism to limit the oncogenic potential of deregulated Ras signals.

Abstract: Diabetic cardiomyopathy contributes to the high incidence of mortality in both types of diabetes. We aimed to investigate the histochemical aspects of collagen and reticular fibers in the cardiac muscle and evaluate the influence of physical exercise on these aspects. Wistar rats were divided in 4 groups: sedentary control (SC), trained control (TC), sedentary diabetic (SD) and trained diabetic (TD). Diabetes was induced with alloxan (35mg/kg). Training program consisted of swimming 1h/day with a load of 4.8% of body weight for TD and 5.2% for TC, during 8 weeks. At the end of the experiment, samples of the left ventricle were collected, fixed in Bouin and processed on historesin. Sections were stained with periodic acid of Schiff, picrosirius-hematoxylin and ammoniacal silver. The PAS technique shows that individuals of group SD presented more intense reaction that the other groups. Picrosirius-hematoxylin technique showed a possible deposition of collagen fibers in SD. The TD group presented a reaction a lot similar to the controls’ for both techniques’, showing a possible prevention of this deposition. These results indicate that physical exercises might have an important role on the prevention of some negative alterations caused by experimental diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
The identity of higher-order neurons and circuits playing an associative role to control feeding is unknown. We injected pseudorabies virus, a retrograde tracer, into masseter muscle, salivary gland, and tongue of BAC-transgenic mice expressing GFP in specific neural populations and identified several CNS regions that project multisynaptically to the periphery. MCH and orexin neurons were identified in the lateral hypothalamus, and Nurr1 and Cnr1 in the amygdala and insular/rhinal cortices. Cholera toxin β tracing showed that insular Nurr1+ and Cnr1+ neurons project to the amygdala or lateral hypothalamus, respectively. Finally, we show that cortical Cnr1+ neurons show increased Cnr1 mRNA and c-Fos expression after fasting, consistent with a possible role for Cnr1+ neurons in feeding. Overall, these studies define a general approach for identifying specific molecular markers for neurons in complex neural circuits. These markers now provide a means for functional studies of specific neuronal populations in feeding or other complex behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is a proteolytic enzyme degrading the extracellular matrix and overexpressed by many tumors. Here, we documented the presence of MMP-2-specific CD4+ T cells in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from melanoma patients. Strikingly, MMP-2-specific CD4+ T cells displayed an inflammatory TH2 profile, i.e., mainly secreting TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-13 and expressing GATA-3. Furthermore, MMP-2-conditioned dendritic cells (DCs) primed naïve CD4+ T cells to differentiate into an inflammatory TH2 phenotype through OX40L expression and inhibition of IL-12p70 production. MMP-2 degrades the type I IFN receptor, thereby preventing STAT1 phosphorylation, which is necessary for IL-12p35 production. Active MMP-2, therefore, acts as an endogenous type 2 “conditioner” and may play a role in the observed prevalence of detrimental type 2 responses in melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Nitrate, an inorganic anion abundant in vegetables, is converted in vivo to bioactive nitrogen oxides including NO. We recently demonstrated that dietary nitrate reduces oxygen cost during physical exercise, but the mechanism remains unknown. In a double-blind crossover trial we studied the effects of a dietary intervention with inorganic nitrate on basal mitochondrial function and whole-body oxygen consumption in healthy volunteers. Skeletal muscle mitochondria harvested after nitrate supplementation displayed an improvement in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency (P/O ratio) and a decrease in state 4 respiration with and without atractyloside and respiration without adenylates. The improved mitochondrial P/O ratio correlated to the reduction in oxygen cost during exercise. Mechanistically, nitrate reduced the expression of ATP/ADP translocase, a protein involved in proton conductance. We conclude that dietary nitrate has profound effects on basal mitochondrial function. These findings may have implications for exercise physiology- and lifestyle-related disorders that involve dysfunctional mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian Phospholipase D MitoPLD facilitates mitochondrial fusion by generating the signaling lipid phosphatidic acid (PA). The Drosophila MitoPLD homolog Zucchini (Zuc), a proposed cytoplasmic nuclease, is required for piRNA generation, a critical event in germline development. We show that Zuc localizes to mitochondria and has MitoPLD-like activity. Conversely, MitoPLD−/− mice exhibit the meiotic arrest, DNA damage, and male sterility characteristic of mice lacking piRNAs. The primary function of MitoPLD seems to be the generation of mitochondrial-surface PA. This PA in turn recruits the phosphatase Lipin 1, which converts PA to diacylglycerol and promotes mitochondrial fission, suggesting a mechanism for mitochondrial morphology homeostasis. MitoPLD and Lipin 1 have opposing effects on mitochondria length and on intermitochondrial cement (nuage), a structure found between aggregated mitochondria that is implicated in piRNA generation. We propose that mitochondrial-surface PA generated by MitoPLD/Zuc recruits or activates nuage components critical for piRNA production.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression mediated by viral vectors is subject to cell-to-cell variability, which limits the accuracy of gene delivery. When coupled with single-cell measurements, however, such variability provides an efficient means to quantify signaling dynamics in mammalian cells. Here, we illustrate the utility of this approach by mapping the E2f1 response to MYC, serum stimulation, or both. Our results revealed an underappreciated mode of gene regulation: E2f1 expression first increased, then decreased as MYC input increased. This biphasic pattern was also reflected in other nodes of the network, including the miR-17-92 microRNA cluster and p19Arf. A mathematical model of the network successfully predicted modulation of the biphasic E2F response by serum and a CDK inhibitor. In addition to demonstrating how noise can be exploited to probe signaling dynamics, our results reveal how coordination of the MYC/RB/E2F pathway enables dynamic discrimination of aberrant and normal levels of growth stimulation.

Abstract: Summary
mTor kinase is involved in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The roles of mTor activators, Rheb1 and Rheb2, have not been established in vivo. Here, we report that Rheb1, but not Rheb2, is critical for embryonic survival and mTORC1 signaling. Embryonic deletion of Rheb1 in neural progenitor cells abolishes mTORC1 signaling in developing brain and increases mTORC2 signaling. Remarkably, embryonic and early postnatal brain development appears grossly normal in these Rheb1f/f,Nes-cre mice with the notable exception of deficits of myelination. Conditional expression of Rheb1 transgene in neural progenitors increases mTORC1 activity and promotes myelination in the brain. In addition the Rheb1 transgene rescues mTORC1 signaling and hypomyelination in the Rheb1f/f,Nes-cre mice. Our study demonstrates that Rheb1 is essential for mTORC1 signaling and myelination in the brain, and suggests that mTORC1 signaling plays a role in selective cellular adaptations, rather than general cellular viability.

Abstract: TRPV6 belongs to the vanilloid family of the transient receptor potential channel (TRP) superfamily. This calcium-selective channel is highly expressed in the duodenum and the placenta, being responsible for calcium absorption in the body and fetus. Previous observations have suggested that TRPV6 is not only permeable to calcium but also to other divalent cations in epithelial tissues. In this study, we tested whether TRPV6 is indeed also permeable to cations such as zinc and cadmium. We found that the basal intracellular calcium concentration was higher in HEK293 cells transfected with hTRPV6 than in non-transfected cells, and that this difference almost disappeared in nominally calcium-free solution. Live cell imaging experiments with Fura-2 and NewPort Green DCF showed that overexpression of human TRPV6 increased the permeability for Ca2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and interestingly also for La3+ and Gd3+. These results were confirmed using the patch clamp technique. 45Ca uptake experiments showed that cadmium, lanthanum and gadolinium were also highly efficient inhibitors of TRPV6-mediated calcium influx at higher micromolar concentrations. Our results suggest that TRPV6 is not only involved in calcium transport but also in the transport of other divalent cations, including heavy metal ions, which may have toxicological implications.

Abstract: It is well established that astrocytes release gliotransmitters and moderate neuronal activity in the central nervous system via intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. Astrocytic Ca2+ oscillations are one type of spontaneous Ca2+ mobilization that occurs in astrocytes. However, the modulation of spontaneous astrocytic Ca2+ oscillations, especially in pathophysiological conditions, is not yet fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that activation of adenosine receptors induces a long-lasting increase in the frequency of astrocytic Ca2+ oscillations in rat hippocampal slice cultures. The long-term facilitation of the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations was mediated by endogenous adenosine generated via breakdown of extracellular ATP by ecto-ATPase. We also demonstrate that local tissue injury with ultraviolet irradiation can cause this long-term facilitation of Ca2+ oscillations via endogenous adenosine. Our data suggest that endogenous adenosine is one of the modulators of spontaneous astrocytic Ca2+ oscillations in the rat hippocampus, and may play a significant role in altered Ca2+ dynamics in astrocytes observed during pathophysiological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
We show that mice with a targeted deficiency in the gene encoding the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1a are resistant to endotoxic shock and systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). When macrophages from the mutant mice were challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, they failed to activate lipogenesis as well as two hallmark inflammasome functions, activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1β. We show that SREBP-1a activates not only genes required for lipogenesis in macrophages but also the gene encoding Nlrp1a, which is a core inflammasome component. Thus, SREBP-1a links lipid metabolism to the innate immune response, which supports our hypothesis that SREBPs evolved to regulate cellular reactions to external challenges that range from nutrient limitation and hypoxia to toxins and pathogens.

Abstract: The female reproductive system of the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans is analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The study focuses in particular on the choriothete, a peculiar uterine structure involved in the viviparous mode of reproduction of Glossina morsitans morsitans. Under light microscopy, the choriothete appears formed by numerous tongue-like folds projecting towards the uterine lumen and lined by a thin cuticle. SEM analysis highlights for the first time a distinctive new feature that is not visible by traditional histological methods. That is a cuticular covering of the choriothete, which shows numerous thorns in the form of crest-like structures arranged in nearly parallel lines. The role of the choriothete in pregnancy and in larval nourishment is discussed.

Abstract: Summary
The histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase Dot1l has been implicated in the development of leukemias bearing translocations of the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene. We identified the MLL-fusion targets in an MLL-AF9 leukemia model, and conducted epigenetic profiling for H3K79me2, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3 in hematopoietic progenitor and leukemia stem cells (LSCs). We found abnormal profiles only for H3K79me2 on MLL-AF9 fusion target loci in LSCs. Inactivation of Dot1l led to downregulation of direct MLL-AF9 targets and an MLL translocation-associated gene expression signature, whereas global gene expression remained largely unaffected. Suppression of MLL translocation-associated gene expression corresponded with dependence of MLL-AF9 leukemia on Dot1l in vivo. These data point to DOT1L as a potential therapeutic target in MLL-rearranged leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Increased mitochondrial biogenesis by activation of PPAR- or AMPK/PGC-1α-dependent homeostatic pathways has been proposed as a treatment for mitochondrial disease. We tested this hypothesis on three recombinant mouse models characterized by defective cytochrome c-oxidase (COX) activity: a knockout (KO) mouse for Surf1, a knockout/knockin mouse for Sco2, and a muscle-restricted KO mouse for Cox15. First, we demonstrated that double-recombinant animals overexpressing PGC-1α in skeletal muscle on a Surf1 KO background showed robust induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and increase of mitochondrial respiratory chain activities, including COX. No such effect was obtained by treating both Surf1−/− and Cox15−/− mice with the pan-PPAR agonist bezafibrate, which instead showed adverse effects in either model. Contrariwise, treatment with the AMPK agonist AICAR led to partial correction of COX deficiency in all three models, and, importantly, significant motor improvement up to normal in the Sco2KO/KI mouse. These results open new perspectives for therapy of mitochondrial disease.

Abstract: Summary
Reducing protein synthesis slows growth and development but can increase adult life span. We demonstrate that knockdown of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), which is downregulated during starvation and dauer state, results in differential translation of genes important for growth and longevity in C. elegans. Genome-wide mRNA translation state analysis showed that inhibition of IFG-1, the C. elegans ortholog of eIF4G, results in a relative increase in ribosomal loading and translation of stress response genes. Some of these genes are required for life span extension when IFG-1 is inhibited. Furthermore, enhanced ribosomal loading of certain mRNAs upon IFG-1 inhibition was correlated with increased mRNA length. This association was supported by changes in the proteome assayed via quantitative mass spectrometry. Our results suggest that IFG-1 mediates the antagonistic effects on growth and somatic maintenance by regulating mRNA translation of particular mRNAs based, in part, on transcript length.

Abstract: In endothelial cells there remain uncertainties in the details of how Ca2+ signals are generated and maintained, especially in intact preparations. In particular the role of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), in contributing to the components of agonist-induced signals is unclear. The aim of this work was to increase understanding of the detailed mechanism of Ca2+ signalling in endothelial cells using real time confocal imaging of Fluo-4 loaded intact rat tail arteries in response to muscarinic stimulation. In particular we have focused on the role of SERCA, and its interplay with capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) and ER Ca2+ release and uptake. We have determined its contribution to the Ca2+ signal and how it varies with different physiological stimuli, including single and repeated carbachol applications and brief and prolonged exposures. In agreement with previous work, carbachol stimulated a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in the endothelial cells, consisting of a rapid initial phase, then a plateau upon which oscillations of Ca2+ were superimposed, followed by a decline to basal Ca2+ levels upon carbachol removal. Our data support the following conclusions: (i) the size (amplitude and duration) of the Ca2+ spike and early oscillations are limited by SERCA activity, thus both are increased if SERCA is inhibited. (ii) SERCA activity is such that brief applications of carbachol do not trigger CCE, presumably because the fall in luminal Ca2+ is not sufficient to trigger it. However, longer applications sufficient to deplete the ER or even partial SERCA inhibition stimulate CCE. (iii) Ca2+ entry occurs via STIM-mediated CCE and SERCA contributes to the cessation of CCE. In conclusion our data show how SERCA function is crucial to shaping endothelial cell Ca signals and its dynamic interplay with both CCE and ER Ca releases.

Abstract: Summary
After immunization or infection, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates diversification of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes in B cells, introducing mutations within the antigen-binding V regions (somatic hypermutation, SHM) and double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) into switch (S) regions, leading to antibody class switch recombination (CSR). We asked if, during B cell activation, AID also induces DNA breaks at genes other than IgH genes. Using a nonbiased genome-wide approach, we have identified hundreds of reproducible, AID-dependent DSBs in mouse splenic B cells shortly after induction of CSR in culture. Most interestingly, AID induces DSBs at sites syntenic with sites of translocations, deletions, and amplifications found in human B cell lymphomas, including within the oncogene B cell lymphoma11a (bcl11a)/evi9. Unlike AID-induced DSBs in Ig genes, genome-wide AID-dependent DSBs are not restricted to transcribed regions and frequently occur within repeated sequence elements, including CA repeats, non-CA tandem repeats, and SINEs.

Abstract: In the present work, the destructive effects of the 4-nonylphenol on one of the most economically important Nile fishes, namely African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) were studied. Apoptosis, erythrocytes alterations, micronucleus test and blood parameters count were used as biological indicators to detect those effects. After exposure to sublethal concentrations of 4-nonylphenol (0, 0.05, 0.08 and 0.1mg/l), apoptotic red blood cells with many malformations and micronucleated erythrocytes were recorded. Decrease in the blood parameters such as red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (Hb), package cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelets, white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocytes, basophils, monocytes and increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), neutrophils, eosinophils indicated the negative effects of 4-nonylphenol. It was concluded that, the 4-nonylphenol caused genotoxicity in erythrocytes with many malformations in shape and number indicated with other blood parameters.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 6 (eIF6) controls translation by regulating 80S subunit formation. eIF6 is overexpressed in tumors. Here, we demonstrate that eIF6 inactivation delays tumorigenesis and reduces tumor growth in vivo. eIF6+/− mice resist to Myc-induced lymphomagenesis and have prolonged tumor-free survival and reduced tumor growth. eIF6+/− mice are also protected by p53 loss. Myc-driven lymphomas contain PKCβII and phosphorylated eIF6; eIF6 is phosphorylated by tumor-derived PKCβII, but not by the eIF4F activator mTORC1. Mutation of PKCβII phosphosite of eIF6 reduces tumor growth. Thus, eIF6 is a rate-limiting controller of initiation of translation, able to affect tumorigenesis and tumor growth. Modulation of eIF6 activity, independent from eIF4F complex, may lead to a therapeutical avenue in tumor therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Members of the crenarchaeal kingdom, such as Sulfolobus, divide by binary fission yet lack genes for the otherwise near-ubiquitous tubulin and actin superfamilies of cytoskeletal proteins. Recent work has established that Sulfolobus homologs of the eukaryotic ESCRT-III and Vps4 components of the ESCRT machinery play an important role in Sulfolobus cell division. In eukaryotes, several pathways recruit ESCRT-III proteins to their sites of action. However, the positioning determinants for archaeal ESCRT-III are not known. Here, we identify a protein, CdvA, that is responsible for recruiting Sulfolobus ESCRT-III to membranes. Overexpression of the isolated ESCRT-III domain that interacts with CdvA results in the generation of nucleoid-free cells. Furthermore, CdvA and ESCRT-III synergize to deform archaeal membranes in vitro. The structure of the CdvA/ESCRT-III interface gives insight into the evolution of the more complex and modular eukaryotic ESCRT complex.

Abstract: Summary
Protein quality control (PQC) degradation systems protect the cell from the toxic accumulation of misfolded proteins. Because any protein can become misfolded, these systems must be able to distinguish abnormal proteins from normal ones, yet be capable of recognizing the wide variety of distinctly shaped misfolded proteins they are likely to encounter. How individual PQC degradation systems accomplish this remains an open question. Here we show that the yeast nuclear PQC ubiquitin ligase San1 directly recognizes its misfolded substrates via intrinsically disordered N- and C-terminal domains. These disordered domains are punctuated with small segments of order and high sequence conservation that serve as substrate-recognition sites San1 uses to target its different substrates. We propose that these substrate-recognition sites, interspersed among flexible, disordered regions, provide San1 an inherent plasticity which allows it to bind its many, differently shaped misfolded substrates.

Abstract: PLAC8 motif-containing proteins form a large family and members can be found in fungi, algae, higher plants and animals. They include the PCR proteins of plants. The name giving PLAC8 domain was originally found in a protein residing in the spongiotrophoblast layer of the placenta of mammals. A further motif found in a large number of these proteins including several PCR proteins is the CCXXXXCPC or CLXXXXCPC motif. Despite their wide distribution our knowledge about the function of these proteins is very limited. For most of them two membranespanning α-helices are predicted, indicating that they are membrane associated or membrane intrinsic proteins. In plants PLAC8 motif-containing proteins have been described to be implicated in two very different functions. On one hand, it has been shown that they are involved in the determination of fruit size and cell number. On the other hand, two members of this family, AtPCR1 and AtPCR2 play an important role in transport of heavy metals such as cadmium or zinc. Transport experiments and approaches to model the 3_D structure of these proteins indicate that they could act as transporters for these divalent cations by forming homomultimers. In this minireview we discuss the present knowledge about this protein family and try to give an outlook on how to integrate the different proposed functions into a common picture about the role of PLAC8 motif-containing proteins.

Dicer's Helicase Domain Discriminates dsRNA Termini to Promote an Altered Reaction Mode,

Abstract: Summary
The role of Dicer's helicase domain is enigmatic, but in vivo it is required for processing certain endogenous siRNA, but not miRNA. By using Caenorhabditis elegans extracts or purified Drosophila Dicer-2 we compared activities of wild-type enzymes and those containing mutations in the helicase domain. We found the helicase domain was essential for cleaving dsRNA with blunt or 5′-overhanging termini, but not those with 3′ overhangs, as found on miRNA precursors. Further, blunt termini, but not 3′ overhangs, led to increased siRNAs from internal regions of dsRNA; this activity required ATP and a functional helicase domain. Our data suggest that blunt or 5′-overhanging termini engage Dicer's helicase domain to facilitate accumulation of siRNAs from internal regions of a dsRNA, an activity suited for processing long siRNA precursors of low abundance, but not necessary for the single cleavage required for miRNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Altered mitochondrial functionality can extend organism life span, but the underlying mechanisms are obscure. Here we report that inactivating SOV1, a member of the yeast mitochondrial translation control (MTC) module, causes a robust Sir2-dependent extension of replicative life span in the absence of respiration and without affecting oxidative damage. We found that SOV1 interacts genetically with the cAMP-PKA pathway and the chromatin remodeling apparatus. Consistently, Sov1p-deficient cells displayed reduced cAMP-PKA signaling and an elevated, Sir2p-dependent, genomic silencing. Both increased silencing and life span extension in sov1Δ cells require the PKA/Msn2/4p target Pnc1p, which scavenges nicotinamide, a Sir2p inhibitor. Inactivating other members of the MTC module also resulted in Sir2p-dependent life span extension. The data demonstrate that the nuclear silencing apparatus senses and responds to the absence of MTC proteins and that this response converges with a pathway for life span extension elicited by reducing TOR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Neural progenitors self-renew and generate neurons throughout the central nervous system. Here, we uncover an unexpected regional specificity in the properties of neural progenitor cells, revealed by the function of a microRNA—miR-9. miR-9 is expressed in neural progenitors, and its knockdown results in an inhibition of neurogenesis along the anterior-posterior axis. However, the underlying mechanism differs—in the hindbrain, progenitors fail to exit the cell cycle, whereas in the forebrain they undergo apoptosis, counteracting the proliferative effect. Among several targets, we functionally identify hairy1 as a primary target of miR-9, regulated at the mRNA level. hairy1 mediates the effects of miR-9 on proliferation, through Fgf8 signaling in the forebrain and Wnt signaling in the hindbrain, but affects apoptosis only in the forebrain, via the p53 pathway. Our findings show a positional difference in the responsiveness of progenitors to miR-9 depletion, revealing an underlying divergence of their properties.

Abstract: Oenocytes are ectodermic cells that participate in a number of critical physiological roles such as detoxification and lipid storage and metabolism in insects. In light of the lack of information on oenocytes from Aedes aegypti and the potential role of these cells in the biology of this major yellow fever and dengue vector, we developed a protocol to purify and maintain Ae. aegypti pupa oenocytes in primary culture. Ae. aegypti oenocytes were cultured as clustered and as isolated ovoid cells with a smooth surface. Our results demonstrate that these cells remain viable in cell culture for at least two months. We also investigated their morphology in vivo and in vitro using light, confocal, scanning and transmission electron microscopes. This work is the first successful attempt in isolating and maintaining Ae. aegypti oenocytes in culture, and a significant step towards understanding the role of this cell type in this important disease vector. The purification and the development of primary cultures of insect oenocytes will allow future studies of their metabolism in producing and secreting compounds.

Abstract: Summary
Normal cells require continuous exposure to growth factors in order to cross a restriction point and commit to cell-cycle progression. This can be replaced by two short, appropriately spaced pulses of growth factors, where the first pulse primes a process, which is completed by the second pulse, and enables restriction point crossing. Through integration of comprehensive proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of each pulse, we identified three processes that regulate restriction point crossing: (1) The first pulse induces essential metabolic enzymes and activates p53-dependent restraining processes. (2) The second pulse eliminates, via the PI3K/AKT pathway, the suppressive action of p53, as well as (3) sets an ERK-EGR1 threshold mechanism, which digitizes graded external signals into an all-or-none decision obligatory for S phase entry. Together, our findings uncover two gating mechanisms, which ensure that cells ignore fortuitous growth factors and undergo proliferation only in response to consistent mitogenic signals.

Abstract: Summary
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) evolves when insulin secretion fails. Insulin release from the pancreatic β cell is controlled by mitochondrial metabolism, which translates fluctuations in blood glucose into metabolic coupling signals. We identified a common variant (rs950994) in the human transcription factor B1 mitochondrial (TFB1M) gene associated with reduced insulin secretion, elevated postprandial glucose levels, and future risk of T2D. Because islet TFB1M mRNA levels were lower in carriers of the risk allele and correlated with insulin secretion, we examined mice heterozygous for Tfb1m deficiency. These mice displayed lower expression of TFB1M in islets and impaired mitochondrial function and released less insulin in response to glucose in vivo and in vitro. Reducing TFB1M mRNA and protein in clonal β cells by RNA interference impaired complexes of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. Consequently, nutrient-stimulated ATP generation was reduced, leading to perturbed insulin secretion. We conclude that a deficiency in TFB1M and impaired mitochondrial function contribute to the pathogenesis of T2D.

Abstract: Cross-talk between subcellular organelles is essential for cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. We have studied the effects of knocking down STIM1, the Ca2+ sensor of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), on several homeostatic Ca2+-handling mechanisms, including plasma membrane Ca2+ entry and transport by ER, mitochondria and nucleus. We have used targeted aequorins to selectively measure calcium fluxes in different organelles. Actions of STIM1 were extremely selective, restricted to store operated Ca2+ channels (SOC) and Ca2+ uptake by the ER. No interactions with uptake or release of Ca2+ by mitochondria or nucleus were detected. Ca2+ exit from the ER, including passive leak, release via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors, was unaffected. STIM1 knock-down inhibited ER Ca2+ uptake in intact but not in permeabilized cells, suggesting a privileged calcium entry-calcium refilling (CECR) coupling between plasma membrane SOC and ER calcium pump in the intact cell. As a result a large part of the entering Ca2+ is taken up into the ER without reaching the bulk cytosol. The tightness of CECR, as measured by the slope of the stimulus-signal strength function, was comparable to classic excitation–response coupling mechanisms, such as excitation–contraction, excitation–secretion or excitation–transcription coupling.

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that the LIGHT-TR2 costimulatory pathway plays a role in the acute and chronic stages of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis [Steinberg et al. (2008); Wang et al. (2005)]. To clarify the role of TNFR-related 2 (TR2) signaling in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis, we generated a TR2 knock-out (KO) mouse. Using DSS to induce colitis, we compared the colitic symptoms and pathological changes in wild type (WT) and TR2 KO mice, and the production of cytokines by the diseased colons. We also studied the role of TR2 in suppressing innate and adaptive immunity in the DSS model. TR2 deficient mice were characterized by reduced symptoms of intestinal inflammation compared with wild-type mice, and reduced production of cytokines. We therefore generated a monoclonal antibody against mouse TR2 which was specific to TR2 and capable of blocking TR2 signals. With this antibody, we demonstrated that antagonizing TR2 during the development of DSS-induced colitis reduced the symptoms of inflammation. Our findings suggest that TR2 is an important mediator in colitis, and may serve as a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.

Abstract: Homozygous Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mutant males exhibit abnormal sperm development. Microscopic examination of the testes from pcd3J-/- mice at postnatal days 12, 15, 18 and 60 revealed histological differences, in comparison to wild-type mice, which were evident by day 18. Greatly reduced numbers of spermatocytes and spermatids were found in the adult testes, and apoptotic cells were identified among the differentiating germ cells after day 15. Our immunohistological analysis using an antihuman AGTPBP1 antibody showed that AGTPBP1 was expressed in spermatogenic cells between late stage primary spermatocytes and round spermatids. A global gene expression analysis from the testes of pcd3J-/- mice showed that expression of cyclin B3 and de-ubiquitinating enzymes USP2 and USP9y was altered by >1.5-fold compared to the expression levels in the wild-type. Our results suggest that the pcc mutant mice have defects in spermatogenesis that begin with the pachytene spermatocyte stage and continue through subsequent stages. Thus, Agtpbpl, the gene responsible for the pcd phenotype, plays an important role in spermatogenesis and is important for survival of germ cells at spermatocytes stage onward.

Abstract: Summary
It has been proposed that an aggressive secondary cancer stem cell population arises from a primary cancer stem cell population through acquisition of additional genetic mutations and drives cancer progression. Overexpression of Polycomb protein EZH2, essential in stem cell self-renewal, has been linked to breast cancer progression. However, critical mechanism linking increased EZH2 expression to BTIC (breast tumor initiating cell) regulation and cancer progression remains unclear. Here, we identify a mechanism in which EZH2 expression-mediated downregulation of DNA damage repair leads to accumulation of recurrent RAF1 gene amplification in BTICs, which activates p-ERK-β-catenin signaling to promote BTIC expansion. We further reveal that AZD6244, a clinical trial drug that inhibits RAF1-ERK signaling, could prevent breast cancer progression by eliminating BTICs.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian cancers depend on “multiple hits,” some of which promote growth and some of which block apoptosis. We screened for mutations that require a synergistic block in apoptosis to promote tissue overgrowth and identified myopic (mop), the Drosophila homolog of the candidate tumor-suppressor and endosomal regulator His-domain protein tyrosine phosphatase (HD-PTP). We find that Myopic regulates the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) tumor suppressor pathway: Myopic PPxY motifs bind conserved residues in the WW domains of the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie, and Myopic colocalizes with Yorkie at endosomes. Myopic controls Yorkie endosomal association and protein levels, ultimately influencing expression of some Yorkie target genes. However, the antiapoptotic gene diap1 is not affected, which may explain the conditional nature of the myopic growth phenotype. These data establish Myopic as a Yorkie regulator and implicate Myopic-dependent association of Yorkie with endosomal compartments as a regulatory step in nuclear outputs of the SWH pathway.

Abstract: Summary
hBRE1/RNF20 is the major E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H2B. RNF20 depletion causes a global reduction of monoubiquitylated H2B (H2Bub) levels and augments the expression of growth-promoting, pro-oncogenic genes. Those genes reside preferentially in compact chromatin and are inefficiently transcribed under basal conditions. We now report that RNF20, presumably via H2Bub, selectively represses those genes by interfering with chromatin recruitment of TFIIS, a factor capable of relieving stalled RNA polymerase II. RNF20 inhibits the interaction between TFIIS and the PAF1 complex and hinders transcriptional elongation. TFIIS ablation selectively abolishes the upregulation of those genes upon RNF20 depletion and attenuates the cellular response to EGF. Consistent with its positive role in transcription of pro-oncogenic genes, TFIIS expression is elevated in various human tumors. Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for selective gene repression by RNF20 and position TFIIS as a key target of RNF20's tumor suppressor activity.

Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy is the common cause of leading to end stage of renal disease (ESRD). Satureja khozestanica essential oil (SKEO) was used as an antioxidant and antidiabetic for the inhibition of diabetic nephropathy. Forty male rats were uninephrectomized and divided in four groups randomly; group one as control, group two diabetic untreatment, groups three and four treatment with SKEO by 250 or 500ppm in drinking water, respectively. Diabetes was induced in the second, third and fourth groups by alloxan injection subcutaneously. After eight weeks treatment, serum malondialdehyde, serum creatinine and serum urea were measured. The kidney paraffin sections were stained by periodic acid Schiff method. Glomerular volume and glomerular number were estimated by stereological rules. Glomerular sclerosis was studied semi-quantitatively. The means were compared by SPSS 13 software and Mann–Whitney test at p<0.05. Satureja khozestanica essential oil (250 or 500ppm) significantly inhibited the progression of glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular number loss, glomerulosclerosis, lipid peroxidation, serum urea and creatinine compared with the diabetic untreated group. The level of glomerular number, serum malondialdehyde, serum creatinine and urea in the treated groups was significantly maintained at the same level as that of the control group. In conclusion, satureja essential oil significantly can ameliorate glomerular hypertrophy, loss of glomerular number, glomerulosclerosis and attenuated serum urea and serum creatinine in diabetic rats.

Abstract: Summary
It is fundamentally important that signaling gradients provide positional information to govern morphogenesis of multicellular organisms. Morphogen gradients can generate different cell types in specific spatial order at distinct threshold concentrations. However, it is largely unknown whether and how signaling gradients also control cell polarities by acting as global cues. Here, we show that Wnt signaling gradient provides directional information to a field of cells. Vangl2, a core component in planar cell polarity, forms Wnt-induced receptor complex with Ror2 to sense Wnt dosages. Wnts dose-dependently induce Vangl2 phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues and Vangl2 activities depend on its levels of phosphorylation. In the limb bud, Wnt5a signaling gradient controls limb elongation by establishing PCP in chondrocytes along the proximal-distal axis through regulating Vangl2 phosphorylation. Our studies have provided new insight to Robinow syndrome, Brachydactyly Type B1, and spinal bifida which are caused by mutations in human ROR2, WNT5A, or VANGL.

Abstract: A moderate change in ambient temperature significantly affects plant physiology including flowering time. MiR399 and its target gene PHOSPHATE 2 (PHO2) are known to play a role in the maintenance of phosphate homeostasis. However, the regulation of flowering time by the miR399-PHO2 module has not been investigated. As we have previously identified miR399 as an ambient temperature-responsive miRNA, we further investigated whether a change in expression of the miR399-PHO2 module affects flowering time in response to ambient temperature changes. Here, we showed that miR399b-overexpressing plants and a loss-of-function allele of PHO2 (pho2) exhibited an early flowering phenotype only at normal temperature (23°C). Interestingly, their flowering time at lower temperature (16ºC) was similar to that of wild-type plants, suggesting that alteration in flowering time by miR399 and its target PHO2 was seen only at normal temperature (23°C). Flowering time ratio (16°C/23°C) revealed that miR399b-overexpressing plants and pho2 mutants showed increased sensitivity to ambient temperature changes. Expression analysis indicated that expression of TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) was increased in miR399b-overexpressing plants and pho2 mutants at 23°C, suggesting that their early flowering phenotype is associated with TSF upregulation. Taken together, our results suggest that miR399, an ambient temperature-responsive miRNA, plays a role in ambient temperature-responsive flowering in Arabidopsis.

Abstract: Summary
MCM proteins are components of a DNA helicase that plays an essential role in DNA replication and cell proliferation. However, MCM proteins are present in excess relative to origins of replication, suggesting they may serve other functions. Decreased proliferation is a fundamental physiological response to hypoxia in many cell types, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) has been implicated in this process. Here, we demonstrate that multiple MCM proteins bind directly to the HIF-1α subunit and synergistically inhibit HIF-1 transcriptional activity via distinct O2-dependent mechanisms. MCM3 inhibits transactivation domain function, whereas MCM7 enhances HIF-1α ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. HIF-1 activity decreases when quiescent cells re-enter the cell cycle, and this effect is MCM dependent. Exposure to hypoxia leads to MCM2–7 downregulation in diverse cell types. These studies reveal a function of MCM proteins apart from their DNA helicase activity and establish a direct link between HIF-1 and the cell-cycle machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Histone H2B ubiquitination plays an important role in regulating chromatin organization during gene transcription. It has been shown that RNF20/40 regulates H2B ubiquitination. Here, using protein affinity purification, we have identified WAC as a functional partner of RNF20/40. Depletion of WAC abolishes H2B ubiquitination. WAC interacts with RNF20/40 through its C-terminal coiled-coil region and promotes RNF20/40 s E3 ligase activity for H2B ubiquitination. The N-terminal WW domain of WAC recognizes RNA polymerase II. During gene transcription, WAC targets RNF20/40 to associate with RNA polymerase II complex for H2B ubiquitination at active transcription sites, which regulates transcription. Moreover, WAC-dependent transcription is important for cell-cycle checkpoint activation in response to genotoxic stress. Taken together, our results demonstrate an important regulator for transcription-coupled histone H2B ubiquitination.

Abstract: The ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1 and the Ca2+ channel Orai1 are key players in store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). In addition, channels from the TRPC family were also shown to be engaged during SOCE, while their precise implication remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the molecular players involved in SOCE triggered by the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin in an endothelial cell line, the EA.hy926. siRNA directed against STIM1 or Orai1 reduced Ca2+ entry by about 50–60%, showing that a large part of the entry is independent from these proteins. Blocking the PLC or the PKC pathway completely abolished thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry in cells depleted from STIM1 and/or Orai1. The phorbol ester PMA or the DAG analog OAG restored the Ca2+ entry inhibited by PLC blockers, showing an involvement of PLC/PKC pathway in SOCE. Using pharmacological inhibitors or siRNA revealed that the PKCeta is required for Ca2+ entry, and pharmacological inhibition of the tyrosine kinase Src also reduced Ca2+ entry. TRPC3 silencing diminished the entry by 45%, while the double STIM1/TRPC3 invalidation reduced Ca2+ entry by more than 85%. Hence, in EA.hy926 cells, TG-induced Ca2+ entry results from the activation of the STIM1/Orai1 machinery, and from the activation of TRPC3.

Abstract: Hyponatremia is a predictor of poor cardiovascular outcomes during acute myocardial infarction and in the setting of preexisting heart failure [1]. There are no definitive mechanisms as to how hyponatremia suppresses cardiac function. In this report we provide evidence for direct down-regulation of Ca2+ channel current in response to low serum Na+. In voltage-clamped rat ventricular myocytes or HEK 293 cells expressing the L-type Ca2+ channel, a 15mM drop in extracellular Na+ suppressed the Ca2+ current by ∼15%; with maximal suppression of ∼30% when Na+ levels were reduced to 100mM or less. The suppressive effects of low Na+ on ICa, in part, depended on the substituting monovalent species (Li+, Cs+, TEA+), but were independent of phosphorylation state of the channel and possible influx of Ca2+ on Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Acidification sensitized the Ca2+ channel current to Na+ withdrawal. Collectively our data suggest that Na+ and H+ may interact with regulatory site(s) at the outer recesses of the Ca2+ channel pore thereby directly modulating the electro-diffusion of the permeating divalents (Ca2+, Ba2+).

Abstract: Summary
B cell-specific coactivator OCA-B, together with Oct-1/2, binds to octamer sites in promoters and enhancers to activate transcription of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, although the mechanisms underlying their roles in enhancer-promoter communication are unknown. Here, we demonstrate a direct interaction of OCA-B with transcription factor TFII-I, which binds to DICE elements in Igh promoters, that affects transcription at two levels. First, OCA-B relieves HDAC3-mediated Igh promoter repression by competing with HDAC3 for binding to promoter-bound TFII-I. Second, and most importantly, Igh 3′ enhancer-bound OCA-B and promoter-bound TFII-I mediate promoter-enhancer interactions, in both cis and trans, that are important for Igh transcription. These and other results reveal an important function for OCA-B in Igh 3′ enhancer function in vivo and strongly favor an enhancer mechanism involving looping and facilitated factor recruitment rather than a tracking mechanism.

Abstract: Improved eating quality is a major breeding target in japonica rice due to market demand. In this study, we performed genetic analysis to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control rice eating quality traits using 192 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between two japonica cultivars, ‘Suweon365’ and ‘Chucheongbyeo’. We evaluated the stickiness (ST) and overall evaluation (OE) of cooked rice using a sensory test, the glossiness of cooked rice (GCR) using a Toyo-taste meter, and measured the amylose content (AC), protein content (PC), alkali digestion value (ADV), and days to heading (DH) of the RILs in the years 2006 and 2007. Our analysis revealed 21 QTLs on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 11. QTLs on chromosomes 6, 7, and 8 were detected for three traits related to eating quality in both years. QTLs for ST and OE were identified by a sensory test in the same region of the QTLs for AC, PC, ADV, GCR and DH on chromosome 8. QTL effects on the GCR were verified using QTL-NILs (near-isogenic lines) of BC3F4-6 in the Suweon365 background, a low eating quality variety, and some BC1F3 lines. Chucheongbyeo alleles at QTLs on chromosomes 7 and 8 increased the GCR in the NILs and backcrossed lines. The QTLs identified by our analysis will be applicable to future marker-assisted selection (MAS) strategies for improving the eating quality of japonica rice.

Abstract: Summary
Cell polarity involves transport of specific membranes and macromolecules at the right time to the right place. In budding yeast, secretory vesicles are transported by the myosin-V Myo2p to sites of cell growth. We show that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) is present in late secretory compartments and is critical for their association with, and transport by, Myo2p. Further, the trans-Golgi network Rab Ypt31/32p and secretory vesicle Rab Sec4p each bind directly, but distinctly, to Myo2p, and these interactions are also required for secretory compartment transport. Enhancing the interaction of Myo2p with PI4P bypasses the requirement for interaction with Ypt31/32p and Sec4p. Together with additional genetic data, the results indicate that Rab proteins and PI4P collaborate in the association of secretory compartments with Myo2p. Thus, we show that a coincidence detection mechanism coordinates inputs from PI4P and the appropriate Rab for secretory compartment transport.

Abstract: Hypoxia of skin is an important physiopathological process in many diseases, such as pressure ulcer, diabetic ulcer, and varicose ulcer. Although cellular injury and inflammation have been involved in hypoxia-induced dermatic injury, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of cobalt chloride (CoCl2), a hypoxia-mimicking agent, on human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and to explore the possible molecular mechanisms. Exposure of HaCaT cells to CoCl2 reduced cell viability and caused overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oversecretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Importantly, CoCl2 exposure elicited overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 subunit. Inhibition of COX-2 by NS-398, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, significantly repressed the cytotoxicity, as well as secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 induced by CoCl2. Inhibition of NF-κB by PDTC (a selective inhibitor of NF-κB) or genetic silencing of p65 by RNAi (Si-p65), attenuated not only the cytotoxicity and secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, but also overexpression of COX-2 in CoCl2-treated HaCaT cells. Neutralizing anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-8 antibody statistically alleviated CoCl2-induced cytotoxicity in HaCaT cells. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a well characterized ROS scavenger, obviously suppressed CoCl2-induced cytotoxicity in HaCaT cells, as well as secretion of IL-6 and IL-8. Additionally, NAC also repressed overexpression of COX-2 and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 subunit induced by CoCl2 in HaCaT cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that oxidative stress mediates chemical hypoxia-induced injury and inflammatory response through activation of NF-κB–COX-2 pathway in HaCaT cells.

Abstract: Histamine, an important chemical mediator, has been shown to regulate inflammation and allergic responses. Stimulation of histamine receptors results in a significant increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+, which could be mediated by inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOC). However, the link between histamine-mediated signaling and activation of inflammatory genes such as cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is still unknown. Our study indicated that the COX-2 protein was highly expressed in human lung cancer cells. Following stimulation with 10μM of histamine, both store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) and COX-2 gene expression were evoked. Histamine-mediated COX-2 activation can be prevented by 2-APB and SKF-96365, SOC channel inhibitors. In addition, deletion analysis of the COX-2 promoter suggested that the region between −80bp and −250bp, which contains NFκB binding sites, is the key element for histamine-mediated signaling. Knocking down ORAI1, one of the essential molecules of store-operated calcium channels, attenuated histamine-mediated COX-2 expression and NFκB activation. These results indicated that ORAI1-mediated NFκB activation was an important signaling pathway, responsible for transmitting histamine signals that trigger inflammatory reactions.
