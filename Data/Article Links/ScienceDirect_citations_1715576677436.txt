Abstract: Summary
The DNAJ-PKAc fusion kinase is a defining feature of fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC). FLC tumors are notoriously resistant to standard chemotherapies, with aberrant kinase activity assumed to be a contributing factor. By combining proximity proteomics, biochemical analyses, and live-cell photoactivation microscopy, we demonstrate that DNAJ-PKAc is not constrained by A-kinase anchoring proteins. Consequently, the fusion kinase phosphorylates a unique array of substrates, including proteins involved in translation and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2-associated athanogene 2 (BAG2), a co-chaperone recruited to the fusion kinase through association with Hsp70. Tissue samples from patients with FLC exhibit increased levels of BAG2 in primary and metastatic tumors. Furthermore, drug studies implicate the DNAJ-PKAc/Hsp70/BAG2 axis in potentiating chemotherapeutic resistance. We find that the Bcl-2 inhibitor navitoclax enhances sensitivity to etoposide-induced apoptosis in cells expressing DNAJ-PKAc. Thus, our work indicates BAG2 as a marker for advanced FLC and a chemotherapeutic resistance factor in DNAJ-PKAc signaling scaffolds.

Abstract: Summary
TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is a potential therapeutic target in multiple cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, targeting TBK1 in clinical practice is challenging. One approach to overcome this challenge would be to identify an upstream TBK1 regulator that could be targeted therapeutically in cancer specifically. In this study, we perform a kinome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen and identify doublecortin-like kinase 2 (DCLK2) as a TBK1 regulator in ccRCC. DCLK2 binds to and directly phosphorylates TBK1 on Ser172. Depletion of DCLK2 inhibits anchorage-independent colony growth and kidney tumorigenesis in orthotopic xenograft models. Conversely, overexpression of DCLK2203, a short isoform that predominates in ccRCC, promotes ccRCC cell growth and tumorigenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, DCLK2203 elicits its oncogenic signaling via TBK1 phosphorylation and activation. Taken together, these results suggest that DCLK2 is a TBK1 activator and potential therapeutic target for ccRCC.

Abstract: Summary
Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has gained attention as a dietary regimen that promotes metabolic health. This study questioned if the health benefits of an intermittent TRF (iTRF) schedule require ketone flux specifically in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Notably, we found that the ketolytic enzyme beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1 (BDH1) is uniquely enriched in isolated mitochondria derived from heart and red/oxidative skeletal muscles, which also have high capacity for fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Using mice with BDH1 deficiency in striated muscles, we discover that this enzyme optimizes FAO efficiency and exercise tolerance during acute fasting. Additionally, iTRF leads to robust molecular remodeling of muscle tissues, and muscle BDH1 flux does indeed play an essential role in conferring the full adaptive benefits of this regimen, including increased lean mass, mitochondrial hormesis, and metabolic rerouting of pyruvate. In sum, ketone flux enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics and supports iTRF-induced remodeling of skeletal muscle and heart.

Abstract: Summary
Synthetic minimal cells are a class of bioreactors that have some, but not all, functions of live cells. Here, we report a critical step toward the development of a bottom-up minimal cell: cellular export of functional protein and RNA products. We used cell-penetrating peptide tags to translocate payloads across a synthetic cell vesicle membrane. We demonstrated efficient transport of active enzymes and transport of nucleic acid payloads by RNA-binding proteins. We investigated influence of a concentration gradient alongside other factors on the efficiency of the translocation, and we show a method to increase product accumulation in one location. We demonstrate the use of this technology to engineer molecular communication between different populations of synthetic cells, to exchange protein and nucleic acid signals. The synthetic minimal cell production and export of proteins or nucleic acids allows experimental designs that approach the complexity and relevancy of natural biological systems. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
DNA loop-extruding SMC complexes play crucial roles in chromosome folding and DNA immunity. Prokaryotic SMC Wadjet (JET) complexes limit the spread of plasmids through DNA cleavage, yet the mechanisms for plasmid recognition are unresolved. We show that artificial DNA circularization renders linear DNA susceptible to JET nuclease cleavage. Unlike free DNA, JET cleaves immobilized plasmid DNA at a specific site, the plasmid-anchoring point, showing that the anchor hinders DNA extrusion but not DNA cleavage. Structures of plasmid-bound JetABC reveal two presumably stalled SMC motor units that are drastically rearranged from the resting state, together entrapping a U-shaped DNA segment, which is further converted to kinked V-shaped cleavage substrate by JetD nuclease binding. Our findings uncover mechanical bending of residual unextruded DNA as molecular signature for plasmid recognition and non-self DNA elimination. We moreover elucidate key elements of SMC loop extrusion, including the motor direction and the structure of a DNA-holding state.

Abstract: Summary
In microbial systems, a metabolic pathway can be either completed by one autonomous population or distributed among a consortium performing metabolic division of labor (MDOL). MDOL facilitates the system’s function by reducing the metabolic burden; however, it may hinder the function by reducing the exchange efficiency of metabolic intermediates among individuals. As a result, the function of a community is influenced by the trade-offs between the metabolic specialization and versatility of individuals. To experimentally test this hypothesis, we deconstructed the naphthalene degradation pathway into four steps and introduced them individually or combinatorically into different strains with varying levels of metabolic specialization. Using these strains, we engineered 1,456 synthetic consortia and found that 74 consortia exhibited higher degradation function than both the autonomous population and rigorous MDOL consortium. Quantitative modeling provides general strategies for identifying the most effective MDOL configuration. Our study provides critical insights into the engineering of high-performance microbial systems.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolism-associated fatty liver disease with accumulated mitochondrial stress, and targeting mitochondrial function is a potential therapy. The mitochondrial genome-encoded bioactive peptide MOTS-c plays broad physiological roles, but its effectiveness and direct targets in NASH treatment are still unclear. Here, we show that long-term preventive and short-term therapeutic effects of MOTS-c treatments alleviate NASH-diet-induced liver steatosis, cellular apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity and metabolites profiling analysis show that MOTS-c significantly reverses NASH-induced mitochondrial metabolic deficiency. Moreover, we identify that MOTS-c directly interacts with the BH3 domain of antiapoptotic B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), increases Bcl-2 protein stability, and suppresses Bcl-2 ubiquitination. By using a Bcl-2 inhibitor or adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated Bcl-2 knockdown, we further confirm that MOTS-c improves NASH-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis, which are dependent on Bcl-2 function. Therefore, our findings show that MOTS-c is a potential therapeutic agent to inhibit the progression of NASH.

Abstract: Summary
Meaningful auditory memories are formed in adults when acoustic information is delivered to the auditory cortex during heightened states of attention, vigilance, or alertness, as mediated by neuromodulatory circuits. Here, we identify that, in awake mice, acoustic stimulation triggers auditory thalamocortical projections to release adenosine, which prevents cortical plasticity (i.e., selective expansion of neural representation of behaviorally relevant acoustic stimuli) and perceptual learning (i.e., experience-dependent improvement in frequency discrimination ability). This sound-evoked adenosine release (SEAR) becomes reduced within seconds when acoustic stimuli are tightly paired with the activation of neuromodulatory (cholinergic or dopaminergic) circuits or periods of attentive wakefulness. If thalamic adenosine production is enhanced, then SEAR elevates further, the neuromodulatory circuits are unable to sufficiently reduce SEAR, and associative cortical plasticity and perceptual learning are blocked. This suggests that transient low-adenosine periods triggered by neuromodulatory circuits permit associative cortical plasticity and auditory perceptual learning in adults to occur.

Abstract: Summary
Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are deadly pediatric brain tumors, non-resectable due to brainstem localization and diffusive growth. Over 80% of DIPGs harbor a mutation in histone 3 (H3.3 or H3.1) resulting in a lysine-to-methionine substitution (H3K27M). Patients with DIPG have a dismal prognosis with no effective therapy. We show that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors lead to a significant reduction in the H3.3K27M protein (up to 80%) in multiple glioma cell lines. We discover that the SB939-mediated H3.3K27M loss is partially blocked by a lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine. The H3.3K27M loss is facilitated by co-occurrence of H2A.Z, as evidenced by the knockdown of H2A.Z isoforms. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis confirms the occupancy of H3.3K27M and H2A.Z at the same SB939-inducible genes. We discover a mechanism showing that HDAC inhibition in DIPG leads to pharmacological modulation of the oncogenic H3.3K27M protein levels. These findings show the possibility of directly targeting the H3.3K27M oncohistone.

Abstract: Summary
During human fetal development, sex differentiation occurs not only in the gonads but also in the adjacent developing reproductive tract. However, while the cellular composition of male and female human fetal gonads is well described, that of the adjacent developing reproductive tract remains poorly characterized. Here, we performed single-cell transcriptomics on male and female human fetal gonads together with the adjacent developing reproductive tract from first and second trimesters, highlighting the morphological and molecular changes during sex differentiation. We validated different cell populations of the developing reproductive tract and gonads and compared the molecular signatures between the first and second trimesters, as well as between sexes, to identify conserved and sex-specific features. Together, our study provides insights into human fetal sex-specific gonadogenesis and development of the reproductive tract beyond the gonads.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T cells are key mediators of various autoimmune diseases; however, their role in disease progression remains unclear due to cellular heterogeneity. Here, we evaluated CD4+ T cell subpopulations using decomposition-based transcriptome characterization and canonical clustering strategies. This approach identified 12 independent gene programs governing whole CD4+ T cell heterogeneity, which can explain the ambiguity of canonical clustering. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis using public single-cell datasets of over 1.8 million peripheral CD4+ T cells from 953 individuals by projecting cells onto the reference and cataloging cell frequency and qualitative alterations of the populations in 20 diseases. The analyses revealed that the 12 transcriptional programs were useful in characterizing each autoimmune disease and predicting its clinical status. Moreover, genetic variants associated with autoimmune diseases showed disease-specific enrichment within the 12 gene programs. The results collectively provide a landscape of single-cell transcriptomes of CD4+ T cell subpopulations involved in autoimmune disease.

Abstract: Summary
Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins accumulate within distinct neuronal systems in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although it is not clear why certain brain regions are more vulnerable to Aβ and tau pathologies than others, gene expression may play a role. We study the association between brain-wide gene expression profiles and regional vulnerability to Aβ (gene-to-Aβ associations) and tau (gene-to-tau associations) pathologies by leveraging two large independent AD cohorts. We identify AD susceptibility genes and gene modules in a gene co-expression network with expression profiles specifically related to regional vulnerability to Aβ and tau pathologies in AD. In addition, we identify distinct biochemical pathways associated with the gene-to-Aβ and the gene-to-tau associations. These findings may explain the discordance between regional Aβ and tau pathologies. Finally, we propose an analytic framework, linking the identified gene-to-pathology associations to cognitive dysfunction in AD at the individual level, suggesting potential clinical implication of the gene-to-pathology associations.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) impair antitumor immune responses. Identifying regulatory circuits during MDSC development may bring new opportunities for therapeutic interventions. We report that the V-domain suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) functions as a key enabler of MDSC differentiation. VISTA deficiency reduced STAT3 activation and STAT3-dependent production of polyamines, which causally impaired mitochondrial respiration and MDSC expansion. In both mixed bone marrow (BM) chimera mice and myeloid-specific VISTA conditional knockout mice, VISTA deficiency significantly reduced tumor-associated MDSCs but expanded monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and enhanced T cell-mediated tumor control. Correlated expression of VISTA and arginase-1 (ARG1), a key enzyme supporting polyamine biosynthesis, was observed in multiple human cancer types. In human endometrial cancer, co-expression of VISTA and ARG1 on tumor-associated myeloid cells is associated with poor survival. Taken together, these findings unveil the VISTA/polyamine axis as a central regulator of MDSC differentiation and warrant therapeutically targeting this axis for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Long interspersed element 1 (L1) retrotransposons are implicated in human disease and evolution. Their global activity is repressed by DNA methylation, but deciphering the regulation of individual copies has been challenging. Here, we combine short- and long-read sequencing to unveil L1 methylation heterogeneity across cell types, families, and individual loci and elucidate key principles involved. We find that the youngest primate L1 families are specifically hypomethylated in pluripotent stem cells and the placenta but not in most tumors. Locally, intronic L1 methylation is intimately associated with gene transcription. Conversely, the L1 methylation state can propagate to the proximal region up to 300 bp. This phenomenon is accompanied by the binding of specific transcription factors, which drive the expression of L1 and chimeric transcripts. Finally, L1 hypomethylation alone is typically insufficient to trigger L1 expression due to redundant silencing pathways. Our results illuminate the epigenetic and transcriptional interplay between retrotransposons and their host genome.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor suppressor BRCA2 functions in homology-directed repair (HDR), the protection of stalled replication forks, and the suppression of replicative gaps, but their relative contributions to genome integrity and chemotherapy response are under scrutiny. Here, we report that mouse and human cells require a RAD51 filament stabilization motif in BRCA2 for fork protection and gap suppression but not HDR. In mice, the loss of fork protection/gap suppression does not compromise genome stability or shorten tumor latency. By contrast, HDR deficiency increases spontaneous and replication stress-induced chromosome aberrations and tumor predisposition. Unlike with HDR, fork protection/gap suppression defects are also observed in Brca2 heterozygous cells, likely due to reduced RAD51 stabilization at stalled forks/gaps. Gaps arise from PRIMPOL activity, which is associated with 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine sensitivity due to the formation of SMUG1-generated abasic sites and is exacerbated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition. However, HDR proficiency has the major role in mitigating sensitivity to chemotherapeutics, including PARP inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Although immunotherapy with PD-(L)1 blockade is routine for lung cancer, little is known about acquired resistance. Among 1,201 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with PD-(L)1 blockade, acquired resistance is common, occurring in >60% of initial responders. Acquired resistance shows differential expression of inflammation and interferon (IFN) signaling. Relapsed tumors can be separated by upregulated or stable expression of IFNγ response genes. Upregulation of IFNγ response genes is associated with putative routes of resistance characterized by signatures of persistent IFN signaling, immune dysfunction, and mutations in antigen presentation genes which can be recapitulated in multiple murine models of acquired resistance to PD-(L)1 blockade after in vitro IFNγ treatment. Acquired resistance to PD-(L)1 blockade in NSCLC is associated with an ongoing, but altered IFN response. The persistently inflamed, rather than excluded or deserted, tumor microenvironment of acquired resistance may inform therapeutic strategies to effectively reprogram and reverse acquired resistance.

Abstract: Summary
The progression from naive through formative to primed in vitro pluripotent stem cell states recapitulates epiblast development in vivo during the peri-implantation period of mouse embryo development. Activation of the de novo DNA methyltransferases and reorganization of transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes are key events that occur during these pluripotent state transitions. However, the upstream regulators that coordinate these events are relatively underexplored. Here, using Zfp281 knockout mouse and degron knockin cell models, we identify the direct transcriptional activation of Dnmt3a/3b by ZFP281 in pluripotent stem cells. Chromatin co-occupancy of ZFP281 and DNA hydroxylase TET1, which is dependent on the formation of R-loops in ZFP281-targeted gene promoters, undergoes a “high-low-high” bimodal pattern regulating dynamic DNA methylation and gene expression during the naive-formative-primed transitions. ZFP281 also safeguards DNA methylation in maintaining primed pluripotency. Our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated role for ZFP281 in coordinating DNMT3A/3B and TET1 functions to promote pluripotent state transitions.

Abstract: Summary
In the mammalian cortex, even simple sensory inputs or movements activate many neurons, with each neuron responding variably to repeated stimuli—a phenomenon known as trial-by-trial variability. Understanding the spatial patterns and dynamics of this variability is challenging. Using cellular 2-photon imaging, we study visual and auditory responses in the primary cortices of awake mice. We focus on how individual neurons’ responses differed from the overall population. We find consistent spatial correlations in these differences that are unique to each trial and linearly scale with the cortical area observed, a characteristic of critical dynamics as confirmed in our neuronal simulations. Using chronic multi-electrode recordings, we observe similar scaling in the prefrontal and premotor cortex of non-human primates during self-initiated and visually cued motor tasks. These results suggest that trial-by-trial variability, rather than being random noise, reflects a critical, fluctuation-dominated state in the cortex, supporting the brain’s efficiency in processing information.

Abstract: Summary
Expansions of CAG trinucleotide repeats cause several rare neurodegenerative diseases. The disease-causing repeats are translated in multiple reading frames and without an identifiable initiation codon. The molecular mechanism of this repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation is not known. We find that expanded CAG repeats create new splice acceptor sites. Splicing of proximal donors to the repeats produces unexpected repeat-containing transcripts. Upon splicing, depending on the sequences surrounding the donor, CAG repeats may become embedded in AUG-initiated open reading frames. Canonical AUG-initiated translation of these aberrant RNAs may account for proteins that have been attributed to RAN translation. Disruption of the relevant splice donors or the in-frame AUG initiation codons is sufficient to abrogate RAN translation. Our findings provide a molecular explanation for the abnormal translation products observed in CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders and add to the repertoire of mechanisms by which repeat expansion mutations disrupt cellular functions.

Abstract: Summary
Cerebellar involvement in both motor and non-motor functions manifests in specific regions of the human cerebellum, revealing the functional heterogeneity within it. One compelling theory places the heterogeneity within the cerebellar functional hierarchy along the sensorimotor-association (SA) axis. Despite extensive neuroimaging studies, evidence for the cerebellar SA axis from different modalities and scales was lacking. Thus, we establish a significant link between the cerebellar SA axis and spatio-molecular profiles. Utilizing the gene set variation analysis, we find the intermediate biological principles the significant genes leveraged to scaffold the cerebellar SA axis. Interestingly, we find these spatio-molecular profiles notably associated with neuropsychiatric dysfunction and recent evolution. Furthermore, cerebello-cerebral interactions at genetic and functional connectivity levels mirror the cerebral cortex and cerebellum’s SA axis. These findings can provide a deeper understanding of how the human cerebellar SA axis is shaped and its role in transitioning from sensorimotor to association functions.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic reprogramming is an important feature of cancers that has been closely linked to post-translational protein modification (PTM). Lysine succinylation is a recently identified PTM involved in regulating protein functions, whereas its regulatory mechanism and possible roles in tumor progression remain unclear. Here, we show that OXCT1, an enzyme catalyzing ketone body oxidation, functions as a lysine succinyltransferase to contribute to tumor progression. Mechanistically, we find that OXCT1 functions as a succinyltransferase, with residue G424 essential for this activity. We also identified serine beta-lactamase-like protein (LACTB) as a main target of OXCT1-mediated succinylation. Extensive succinylation of LACTB K284 inhibits its proteolytic activity, resulting in increased mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration, ultimately leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. In summary, this study establishes lysine succinyltransferase function of OXCT1 and highlights a link between HCC prognosis and LACTB K284 succinylation, suggesting a potentially valuable biomarker and therapeutic target for further development.

Abstract: Summary
Protein-RNA regulatory networks underpin much of biology. C. elegans FBF-2, a PUF-RNA-binding protein, binds over 1,000 RNAs to govern stem cells and differentiation. FBF-2 interacts with multiple protein partners via a key tyrosine, Y479. Here, we investigate the in vivo significance of partnerships using a Y479A mutant. Occupancy of the Y479A mutant protein increases or decreases at specific sites across the transcriptome, varying with RNAs. Germline development also changes in a specific fashion: Y479A abolishes one FBF-2 function—the sperm-to-oocyte cell fate switch. Y479A’s effects on the regulation of one mRNA, gld-1, are critical to this fate change, though other network changes are also important. FBF-2 switches from repression to activation of gld-1 RNA, likely by distinct FBF-2 partnerships. The role of RNA-binding protein partnerships in governing RNA regulatory networks will likely extend broadly, as such partnerships pervade RNA controls in virtually all metazoan tissues and species.

Abstract: Summary
Previous studies have suggested that the endocardium contributes to hematopoiesis in murine embryos, although definitive evidence to demonstrate the hematopoietic potential of the endocardium is still missing. Here, we use a zebrafish embryonic model to test the emergence of hematopoietic progenitors from the endocardium. By using a combination of expression analysis, time-lapse imaging, and lineage-tracing approaches, we demonstrate that myeloid cells emerge from the endocardium in zebrafish embryos. Inhibition of Etv2/Etsrp or Scl/Tal1, two known master regulators of hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis, does not affect the emergence of endocardial-derived myeloid cells, while inhibition of Hedgehog signaling results in their reduction. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis followed by experimental validation suggests that the endocardium is the major source of neutrophilic granulocytes. These findings will promote our understanding of alternative mechanisms involved in hematopoiesis, which are likely to be conserved between zebrafish and mammalian embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Viral mimicry describes the immune response induced by endogenous stimuli such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from endogenous retroelements. Activation of viral mimicry has the potential to kill cancer cells or augment anti-tumor immune responses. Here, we systematically identify mechanisms of viral mimicry adaptation associated with cancer cell dependencies. Among the top hits is the RNA decay protein XRN1 as an essential gene for the survival of a subset of cancer cell lines. XRN1 dependency is mediated by mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein and protein kinase R activation and is associated with higher levels of cytosolic dsRNA, higher levels of a subset of Alus capable of forming dsRNA, and higher interferon-stimulated gene expression, indicating that cells die due to induction of viral mimicry. Furthermore, dsRNA-inducing drugs such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine and palbociclib can generate a synthetic dependency on XRN1 in cells initially resistant to XRN1 knockout. These results indicate that XRN1 is a promising target for future cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Lymphatic metastasis is a common metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). The current study illustrated the action of lncRNA NKX2–1-AS1 in lymphangiogenesis in LUAD and the underlying mechanisms. Clinical tissue samples were collected for determining NKX2–1-AS1 expression. Then, H441 and H661 cells were selected to perform gain- and loss-of-function assays for dissecting the roles of NKX2–1-AS1 in LUAD cell proliferation and migration. Besides, H441 and H661 cell supernatant was harvested to stimulate HLECs for assessing tube formation ability. Interaction among NKX2–1-AS1, ERG, and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) was validated through luciferase and RIP assays. NKX2–1-AS1 was highly-expressed in LUAD tissues. Silencing NKX2–1-AS1 suppressed H441 and H661 cell proliferation and migration, reduced expression levels of lymphangiogenesis-related factors (LYVE-1, VEGF-C, VEGFR3, VEGF-A, VEGFR2, and CCR7), and inhibited HLEC tube formation. Interaction validation demonstrated that NKX2–1-AS1 regulated FABP4 transcription by binding to ERG. Overexpression of FABP4 could effectively block the inhibition role of NKX2–1-AS1 silencing in lymphangiogenesis in H441 and H661 cells. This study provided evidence that NKX2–1-AS1 regulated FABP4 transcription by binding to ERG to facilitate the proliferation and migration of LUAD cells and tube formation of HLECs, thus participating in lymphangiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Macropinocytosis, an evolutionarily conserved endocytic pathway, mediates nonselective bulk uptake of extracellular fluid. It is the primary route for axenic Dictyostelium cells to obtain nutrients and has also emerged as a nutrient-scavenging pathway for mammalian cells. How cells adjust macropinocytic activity in various physiological or developmental contexts remains to be elucidated. We discovered that, in Dictyostelium cells, the transcription factors Hbx5 and MybG form a functional complex in the nucleus to maintain macropinocytic activity during the growth stage. In contrast, during starvation-induced multicellular development, the transcription factor complex undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in response to oscillatory cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) signals, which leads to increased cytoplasmic retention of the complex and progressive downregulation of macropinocytosis. Therefore, by coupling macropinocytosis-related gene expression to the cAMP oscillation system, which facilitates long-range cell-cell communication, the dynamic translocation of the Hbx5-MybG complex orchestrates a population-level adjustment of macropinocytic activity to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) facilitate intercellular communication by transferring cargo between cells in a variety of tissues. However, how EVs achieve cell-type-specific intercellular communication is still largely unknown. We found that Notch1 and Notch2 proteins are expressed on the surface of neuronal EVs that have been generated in response to neuronal excitatory synaptic activity. Notch ligands bind these EVs on the neuronal plasma membrane, trigger their internalization, activate the Notch signaling pathway, and drive the expression of Notch target genes. The generation of these neuronal EVs requires the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-associated protein Alix. Adult Alix conditional knockout mice have reduced hippocampal Notch signaling activation and glutamatergic synaptic protein expression. Thus, EVs facilitate neuron-to-neuron communication via the Notch receptor-ligand system in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Malignant ascites accompanied by peritoneal dissemination contain various factors and cell populations as well as cancer cells; however, how the tumor microenvironment is shaped in ascites remains unclear. Single-cell proteomic profiling and a comprehensive proteomic analysis are conducted to comprehensively characterize malignant ascites. Here, we find defects in immune effectors along with immunosuppressive cell accumulation in ascites of patients with gastric cancer (GC) and identify five distinct subpopulations of CD45(−)/EpCAM(−) cells. Mesothelial cells with mesenchymal features in CD45(−)/EpCAM(−) cells are the predominant source of chemokines involved in immunosuppressive myeloid cell (IMC) recruitment. Moreover, mesothelial-mesenchymal transition (MMT)-induced mesothelial cells strongly express extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes, including tenascin-C (TNC), enhancing metastatic colonization. These findings highlight the definite roles of the mesenchymal cell population in the development of a protumorigenic microenvironment to promote peritoneal dissemination.

Abstract: Summary
The Bloom syndrome helicase BLM interacts with topoisomerase IIIα (TOP3A), RMI1, and RMI2 to form the BTR complex, which dissolves double Holliday junctions and DNA replication intermediates to promote sister chromatid disjunction before cell division. In its absence, structure-specific nucleases like the SMX complex (comprising SLX1-SLX4, MUS81-EME1, and XPF-ERCC1) can cleave joint DNA molecules instead, but cells deficient in both BTR and SMX are not viable. Here, we identify a negative genetic interaction between BLM loss and deficiency in the BRCA1-BARD1 tumor suppressor complex. We show that this is due to a previously overlooked role for BARD1 in recruiting SLX4 to resolve DNA intermediates left unprocessed by BLM in the preceding interphase. Consequently, cells with defective BLM and BRCA1-BARD1 accumulate catastrophic levels of chromosome breakage and micronucleation, leading to cell death. Thus, we reveal mechanistic insights into SLX4 recruitment to DNA lesions, with potential clinical implications for treating BRCA1-deficient tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Outside of the laboratory, animals behave in spaces where they can transition between open areas and coverage as they interact with others. Replicating these conditions in the laboratory can be difficult to control and record. This has led to a dominance of relatively simple, static behavioral paradigms that reduce the ethological relevance of behaviors and may alter the engagement of cognitive processes such as planning and decision-making. Therefore, we developed a method for controllable, repeatable interactions with others in a reconfigurable space. Mice navigate a large honeycomb lattice of adjustable obstacles as they interact with an autonomous robot coupled to their actions. We illustrate the system using the robot as a pseudo-predator, delivering airpuffs to the mice. The combination of obstacles and a mobile threat elicits a diverse set of behaviors, such as increased path diversity, peeking, and baiting, providing a method to explore ethologically relevant behaviors in the laboratory.

Abstract: Summary
Neuron migration is a key phase of neurogenesis, critical for the assembly and function of neuronal circuits. In songbirds, this process continues throughout life, but how these newborn neurons disperse through the adult brain is unclear. We address this question using in vivo two-photon imaging in transgenic zebra finches that express GFP in young neurons and other cell types. In juvenile and adult birds, migratory cells are present at a high density, travel in all directions, and make frequent course changes. Notably, these dynamic migration patterns are well fit by a superdiffusive model. Simulations reveal that these superdiffusive dynamics are sufficient to disperse new neurons throughout the song nucleus HVC. These results suggest that superdiffusive migration may underlie the formation and maintenance of nuclear brain structures in the postnatal brain and indicate that transgenic songbirds are a useful resource for future studies into the mechanisms of adult neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The details of how macrophages control different healing trajectories (regeneration vs. scar formation) remain poorly defined. Spiny mice (Acomys spp.) can regenerate external ear pinnae tissue, whereas lab mice (Mus musculus) form scar tissue in response to an identical injury. Here, we used this dual species system to dissect macrophage phenotypes between healing modes. We identified secreted factors from activated Acomys macrophages that induce a pro-regenerative phenotype in fibroblasts from both species. Transcriptional profiling of Acomys macrophages and subsequent in vitro tests identified VEGFC, PDGFA, and Lactotransferrin (LTF) as potential pro-regenerative modulators. Examining macrophages in vivo, we found that Acomys-resident macrophages secreted VEGFC and LTF, whereas Mus macrophages do not. Lastly, we demonstrate the requirement for VEGFC during regeneration and find that interrupting lymphangiogenesis delays blastema and new tissue formation. Together, our results demonstrate that cell-autonomous mechanisms govern how macrophages react to the same stimuli to differentially produce factors that facilitate regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway integrates complex cytokine signals via a limited number of molecular components, inspiring numerous efforts to clarify the diversity and specificity of STAT transcription factor function. We developed a computational framework to make global cytokine-induced gene predictions from STAT phosphorylation dynamics, modeling macrophage responses to interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, which signal through common STATs, but with distinct temporal dynamics and contrasting functions. Our mechanistic-to-machine learning model identified cytokine-specific genes associated with late pSTAT3 time frames and a preferential pSTAT1 reduction upon JAK2 inhibition. We predicted and validated the impact of JAK2 inhibition on gene expression, identifying genes that were sensitive or insensitive to JAK2 variation. Thus, we successfully linked STAT signaling dynamics to gene expression to support future efforts targeting pathology-associated STAT-driven gene sets. This serves as a first step in developing multi-level prediction models to understand and perturb gene expression outputs from signaling systems. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
While neurostimulation technologies are rapidly approaching clinical applications for sensorimotor disorders, the impact of electrical stimulation on network dynamics is still unknown. Given the high degree of shared processing in neural structures, it is critical to understand if neurostimulation affects functions that are related to, but not targeted by, the intervention. Here, we approach this question by studying the effects of electrical stimulation of cutaneous afferents on unrelated processing of proprioceptive inputs. We recorded intraspinal neural activity in four monkeys while generating proprioceptive inputs from the radial nerve. We then applied continuous stimulation to the radial nerve cutaneous branch and quantified the impact of the stimulation on spinal processing of proprioceptive inputs via neural population dynamics. Proprioceptive pulses consistently produce neural trajectories that are disrupted by concurrent cutaneous stimulation. This disruption propagates to the somatosensory cortex, suggesting that electrical stimulation can perturb natural information processing across the neural axis.

Recent regenerative studies using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have developed multiple kidney-lineage cells and organoids. However, to further form functional segments of the kidney, interactions of epithelial and interstitial cells are required. Here we describe a selective differentiation of renal interstitial progenitor-like cells (IPLCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by modifying our previous induction method for nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) and analyzing mouse embryonic interstitial progenitor cell (IPC) development. Our IPLCs combined with hiPSC-derived NPCs and nephric duct cells form nephrogenic niche- and mesangium-like structures in vitro. Furthermore, we successfully induce hiPSC-derived IPLCs to differentiate into mesangial and erythropoietin-producing cell lineages in vitro by screening differentiation-inducing factors and confirm that p38 MAPK, hypoxia, and VEGF signaling pathways are involved in the differentiation of mesangial-lineage cells. These findings indicate that our IPC-lineage induction method contributes to kidney regeneration and developmental research.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical genetic screens are a powerful tool for exploring how cancer cells’ response to drugs is shaped by their mutations, yet they lack a molecular view of the contribution of individual genes to the response to exposure. Here, we present sci-Plex-Gene-by-Environment (sci-Plex-GxE), a platform for combined single-cell genetic and chemical screening at scale. We highlight the advantages of large-scale, unbiased screening by defining the contribution of each of 522 human kinases to the response of glioblastoma to different drugs designed to abrogate signaling from the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. In total, we probed 14,121 gene-by-environment combinations across 1,052,205 single-cell transcriptomes. We identify an expression signature characteristic of compensatory adaptive signaling regulated in a MEK/MAPK-dependent manner. Further analyses aimed at preventing adaptation revealed promising combination therapies, including dual MEK and CDC7/CDK9 or nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) inhibitors, as potent means of preventing transcriptional adaptation of glioblastoma to targeted therapy.

Abstract: Summary
During sensory-guided behavior, an animal’s decision-making dynamics unfold through sequences of distinct performance states, even while stimulus-reward contingencies remain static. Little is known about the factors that underlie these changes in task performance. We hypothesize that these decision-making dynamics can be predicted by externally observable measures, such as uninstructed movements and changes in arousal. Here, using computational modeling of visual and auditory task performance data from mice, we uncovered lawful relationships between transitions in strategic task performance states and an animal’s arousal and uninstructed movements. Using hidden Markov models applied to behavioral choices during sensory discrimination tasks, we find that animals fluctuate between minutes-long optimal, sub-optimal, and disengaged performance states. Optimal state epochs are predicted by intermediate levels, and reduced variability, of pupil diameter and movement. Our results demonstrate that externally observable uninstructed behaviors can predict optimal performance states and suggest that mice regulate their arousal during optimal performance.

Abstract: Summary
Regeneration involves gene expression changes explained in part by context-dependent recruitment of transcriptional activators to distal enhancers. Silencers that engage repressive transcriptional complexes are less studied than enhancers and more technically challenging to validate, but they potentially have profound biological importance for regeneration. Here, we identified candidate silencers through a screening process that examined the ability of DNA sequences to limit injury-induced gene expression in larval zebrafish after fin amputation. A short sequence (s1) on chromosome 5 near several genes that reduce expression during adult fin regeneration could suppress promoter activity in stable transgenic lines and diminish nearby gene expression in knockin lines. High-resolution analysis of chromatin organization identified physical associations of s1 with gene promoters occurring preferentially during fin regeneration, and genomic deletion of s1 elevated the expression of these genes after fin amputation. Our study provides methods to identify “tissue regeneration silencer elements” (TRSEs) with the potential to reduce unnecessary or deleterious gene expression during regeneration.

Abstract: Background
Doxorubicin (Dox) is one of the most effective anti-neoplastic agents. Quercetin (QE) exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
Aim
To detect neuroprotective properties of quercetin in rats exposed to doxorubicin-induced brain injury.
Material and methods
48 rats were allocated equally into four groups: control group: (given normal saline), QE group: (given 80 mg/kg of QE orally daily for 2 weeks), Dox group: (received 2.5 mg/kg of Dox every other day for a total of seven intraperitoneal injections), and Dox+QE group: (received 2.5 mg/kg of Dox every other day for a total of seven intraperitoneal injections and 80 mg/kg of QE orally daily for 2 weeks). Subsequently, biochemical analyses were carried out along with histopathological (light and electron microscopic) and immunohistochemical examinations of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.
Results
The Dox group revealed a decline in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, along with an increase in malondialdehyde and an increase in DNA damage. Furthermore, sections of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus revealed neurodegenerative changes, decreased synaptophysin, and increased Interleukin-1 beta expressions. Biochemical and histopathological results were markedly improved by QE administration.
Conclusions
It can be concluded that QE induces protective effects against Dox-induced neurotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Augmented CD4+ T cell response in autoimmunity is characterized by extensive metabolic reprogramming. However, the epigenetic molecule that drives the metabolic adaptation of CD4+ T cells remains largely unknown. Here, we show that lysine acetyltransferase 6A (KAT6A), an epigenetic modulator that is clinically associated with autoimmunity, orchestrates the metabolic reprogramming of glucose in CD4+ T cells. KAT6A is required for the proliferation and differentiation of proinflammatory CD4+ T cell subsets in vitro, and mice with KAT6A-deficient CD4+ T cells are less susceptible to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and colitis. Mechanistically, KAT6A orchestrates the abundance of histone acetylation at the chromatin where several glycolytic genes are located, thus affecting glucose metabolic reprogramming and subsequent CD4+ T cell responses. Treatment with KAT6A small-molecule inhibitors in mouse models shows high therapeutic value for targeting KAT6A in autoimmunity. Our study provides novel insights into the epigenetic programming of immunometabolism and suggests potential therapeutic targets for patients with autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
Although the role of ferroptosis in killing tumor cells is well established, recent studies indicate that ferroptosis inducers also sabotage anti-tumor immunity by killing neutrophils and thus unexpectedly stimulate tumor growth, raising a serious issue about whether ferroptosis effectively suppresses tumor development in vivo. Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screenings, we discover a pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 2 (PHLDA2)-mediated ferroptosis pathway that is neither ACSL4-dependent nor requires common ferroptosis inducers. PHLDA2-mediated ferroptosis acts through the peroxidation of phosphatidic acid (PA) upon high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS-induced ferroptosis is critical for tumor growth in the absence of common ferroptosis inducers; strikingly, loss of PHLDA2 abrogates ROS-induced ferroptosis and promotes tumor growth but has no obvious effect in normal tissues in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse tumor models. These data demonstrate that PHLDA2-mediated PA peroxidation triggers a distinct ferroptosis response critical for tumor suppression and reveal that PHLDA2-mediated ferroptosis occurs naturally in vivo without any treatment from ferroptosis inducers.

Abstract: Summary
Extensive remodeling of the female mammary epithelium during development and pregnancy has been linked to cancer susceptibility. The faithful response of mammary epithelial cells (MECs) to hormone signaling is key to avoiding breast cancer development. Here, we show that lactogenic differentiation of murine MECs requires silencing of genes encoding ribosomal RNA (rRNA) by the antisense transcript PAPAS. Accordingly, knockdown of PAPAS derepresses rRNA genes, attenuates the response to lactogenic hormones, and induces malignant transformation. Restoring PAPAS levels in breast cancer cells reduces tumorigenicity and lung invasion and activates many interferon-regulated genes previously linked to metastasis suppression. Mechanistically, PAPAS transcription depends on R-loop formation at the 3′ end of rRNA genes, which is repressed by RNase H1 and replication protein A (RPA) overexpression in breast cancer cells. Depletion of PAPAS and upregulation of RNase H1 and RPA in human breast cancer underpin the clinical relevance of our findings.

Abstract: Summary
Axotomized spinal motoneurons (MNs) lose presynaptic inputs following peripheral nerve injury; however, the cellular mechanisms that lead to this form of synapse loss are currently unknown. Here, we delineate a critical role for neuronal kinase dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK)/MAP3K12, which becomes activated in axotomized neurons. Studies with conditional knockout mice indicate that DLK signaling activation in injured MNs triggers the induction of phagocytic microglia and synapse loss. Aspects of the DLK-regulated response include expression of C1q first from the axotomized MN and then later in surrounding microglia, which subsequently phagocytose presynaptic components of upstream synapses. Pharmacological ablation of microglia inhibits the loss of cholinergic C boutons from axotomized MNs. Together, the observations implicate a neuronal mechanism, governed by the DLK, in the induction of inflammation and the removal of synapses.

Abstract: Summary
We here demonstrate that SERTAD1 is an adaptor protein responsible for the regulation of lysine 63 (K63)-linked NLRP3 polyubiquitination by the Cullin1 E3 ubiquitin ligase upon inflammasome activation. SERTAD1 specifically binds to NLRP3 but not to other inflammasome sensors. This endogenous interaction increases after inflammasome activation, interfering with the interaction between NLRP3 and Cullin1. Interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 secretion, as well as the cleavage of gasdermin D, are decreased in SERTAD1 knockout bone-marrow-derived macrophages, together with reduced formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. Additionally, SERTAD1-deficient mice show attenuated severity of monosodium-uric-acid-induced peritonitis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Analysis of public datasets indicates that expression of SERTAD1 mRNA is significantly increased in the patients of autoimmune diseases. Thus, our findings uncover a function of SERTAD1 that specifically reduces Cullin1-mediated NLRP3 polyubiquitination via direct binding to NLRP3, eventually acting as a crucial factor to regulate the initiation of NLRP3-mediated inflammasome activation.

Abstract: Summary
The evolutionary trajectory of glioblastoma (GBM) is a multifaceted biological process that extends beyond genetic alterations alone. Here, we perform an integrative proteogenomic analysis of 123 longitudinal glioblastoma pairs and identify a highly proliferative cellular state at diagnosis and replacement by activation of neuronal transition and synaptogenic pathways in recurrent tumors. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses reveal that the molecular transition to neuronal state at recurrence is marked by post-translational activation of the wingless-related integration site (WNT)/ planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway and BRAF protein kinase. Consistently, multi-omic analysis of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models mirror similar patterns of evolutionary trajectory. Inhibition of B-raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) kinase impairs both neuronal transition and migration capability of recurrent tumor cells, phenotypic hallmarks of post-therapy progression. Combinatorial treatment of temozolomide (TMZ) with BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, significantly extends the survival of PDX models. This study provides comprehensive insights into the biological mechanisms of glioblastoma evolution and treatment resistance, highlighting promising therapeutic strategies for clinical intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Adoptive cell therapies are emerging forms of immunotherapy that reprogram T cells for enhanced antitumor responses. Although surface programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) engagement inhibits antitumor immunity, the role of cell-intrinsic PD-L1 in adoptive T cell therapy remains unknown. Here, we found that intracellular PD-L1 was enriched in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells of cancer patients. PD-L1 ablation promoted antitumor immune responses and the maintenance of an effector-like state of therapeutic CD8+ T cells, while blockade of surface PD-L1 was unable to impact on their expansion and function. Moreover, cell-intrinsic PD-L1 impeded CD8+ T cell activity, which partially relied on mTORC1 signaling. Furthermore, endogenous tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells were motivated by BATF3-driven dendritic cells after adoptive transfer of PD-L1-deficient therapeutic CD8+ T cells. This role of cell-intrinsic PD-L1 in therapeutic CD8+ T cell dysfunction highlights that disrupting cell-intrinsic PD-L1 in CD8+ T cells represents a viable approach to improving T cell-based cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Perlecan (HSPG2), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan similar to agrin, is key for extracellular matrix (ECM) maturation and stabilization. Although crucial for cardiac development, its role remains elusive. We show that perlecan expression increases as cardiomyocytes mature in vivo and during human pluripotent stem cell differentiation to cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Perlecan-haploinsuffient hPSCs (HSPG2+/−) differentiate efficiently, but late-stage CMs have structural, contractile, metabolic, and ECM gene dysregulation. In keeping with this, late-stage HSPG2+/− hPSC-CMs have immature features, including reduced ⍺-actinin expression and increased glycolytic metabolism and proliferation. Moreover, perlecan-haploinsuffient engineered heart tissues have reduced tissue thickness and force generation. Conversely, hPSC-CMs grown on a perlecan-peptide substrate are enlarged and display increased nucleation, typical of hypertrophic growth. Together, perlecan appears to play the opposite role of agrin, promoting cellular maturation rather than hyperplasia and proliferation. Perlecan signaling is likely mediated via its binding to the dystroglycan complex. Targeting perlecan-dependent signaling may help reverse the phenotypic switch common to heart failure.

Abstract: Summary
Different types of cells uptake fatty acids in response to different stimuli or physiological conditions; however, little is known about context-specific regulation of fatty acid uptake. Here, we show that muscle injury induces fatty acid uptake in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to promote their proliferation and muscle regeneration. In humans and mice, fatty acids are mobilized after muscle injury. Through CD36, fatty acids function as both fuels and growth signals to promote MuSC proliferation. Mechanistically, injury triggers the translocation of CD36 in MuSCs, which relies on dynamic palmitoylation of STX11. Palmitoylation facilitates the formation of STX11/SNAP23/VAMP4 SANRE complex, which stimulates the fusion of CD36- and STX11-containing vesicles. Restricting fatty acid supply, blocking fatty acid uptake, or inhibiting STX11 palmitoylation attenuates muscle regeneration in mice. Our studies have identified a critical role of fatty acids in muscle regeneration and shed light on context-specific regulation of fatty acid sensing and uptake.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells maintain telomeres by upregulating telomerase or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) via homology-directed repair at telomeric DNA breaks. 8-Oxoguanine (8oxoG) is a highly prevalent endogenous DNA lesion in telomeric sequences, altering telomere structure and telomerase activity, but its impact on ALT is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that targeted 8oxoG formation at telomeres stimulates ALT activity and homologous recombination specifically in ALT cancer cells. Mechanistically, an acute 8oxoG induction increases replication stress, as evidenced by increased telomere fragility and ATR kinase activation at ALT telomeres. Furthermore, ALT cells are more sensitive to chronic telomeric 8oxoG damage than telomerase-positive cancer cells, consistent with increased 8oxoG-induced replication stress. However, telomeric 8oxoG production in G2 phase, when ALT telomere elongation occurs, impairs telomeric DNA synthesis. Our study demonstrates that a common oxidative base lesion has a dual role in regulating ALT depending on when the damage arises in the cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Cell fate is determined by specific transcription programs that are essential for tissue homeostasis and regeneration. The E3-ligases RING1A and B represent the core activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) that deposits repressive histone H2AK119 mono-ubiquitination (H2AK119ub1), which is essential for mouse intestinal homeostasis by preserving stem cell functions. However, the specific role of different PRC1 forms, which are defined by the six distinct PCGF1–6 paralogs, remains largely unexplored in vivo. We report that PCGF6 regulates mouse intestinal Tuft cell differentiation independently of H2AK119ub1 deposition. We show that PCGF6 chromatin occupancy expands outside Polycomb repressive domains, associating with unique promoter and distal regulatory elements. This occurs in the absence of RING1A/B and involves MGA-mediated E-BOX recognition and specific H3K9me2 promoter deposition. PCGF6 inactivation induces an epithelial autonomous accumulation of Tuft cells that was not phenocopied by RING1A/B loss. This involves direct PCGF6 association with a Tuft cell differentiation program that identified Polycomb-independent properties of PCGF6 in adult tissues homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor p53 controls cell fate decisions and prevents malignant transformation, but its functions in antiviral immunity remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that p53 metabolically promotes antiviral innate immune responses to RNA viral infection. p53-deficient macrophages or mice display reduced expression of glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase 2 (GFPT2), a key enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Through transcriptional upregulation of GFPT2, p53 drives HBP activity and de novo synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, which in turn leads to the O-GlcNAcylation of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and UBX-domain-containing protein 1 (UBXN1) during virus infection. Moreover, O-GlcNAcylation of UBXN1 blocks its interaction with MAVS, thereby further liberating MAVS for tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 binding to activate TANK-binding kinase 1-interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 signaling cascades and IFN-β production. Genetic or pharmaceutical inhibition of GFPT efficiently reduces MAVS activation and abrogates the antiviral innate immunity promoted by p53 in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal that p53 drives HBP activity and O-GlcNAcylation of UBXN1 and MAVS to enhance IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Despite recent advances, challenges remain in understanding the bidirectional interactions or interplay between organelles during ferroptosis. In this study, we aimed to understand the interplay between mitochondria (Mito) and lysosomes (Lyso) in cell homeostasis and ferroptosis. For this purpose, we designed a single fluorescent probe that marks GSH in Mito and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in Lyso with two distinct emissions. Using this dual-targeted single fluorescent probe (9-morphorino pyronine), we detected Mito-Lyso interplay in ferroptosis. We disclosed differences in Mito-Lyso interplay depending on the induction of ferroptosis. Although erastin treatment decreased GSH, RSL3 triggered a HOCl burst, and FIN56- and FINO2-induced ferroptosis increased GSH and HOCl. Additionally, we showed that only extracellular vesicles generated during erastin-induced ferroptosis could spontaneously move and dock to neighboring cells, resulting in accelerated cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of cellular senescence, with the loss of mitochondrial function identified as a potential causal factor contributing to senescence-associated decline in cellular functions. Our recent findings revealed that ectopic expression of the pluripotency transcription factor NANOG rejuvenates dysfunctional mitochondria of senescent cells by rewiring metabolic pathways. In this study, we report that NANOG restores the expression of key enzymes, PYCR1 and PYCR2, in the proline biosynthesis pathway. Additionally, senescent mesenchymal stem cells manifest severe mitochondrial respiratory impairment, which is alleviated through proline supplementation. Proline induces mitophagy by activating AMP-activated protein kinase α and upregulating Parkin expression, enhancing mitochondrial clearance and ultimately restoring cell metabolism. Notably, proline treatment also mitigates several aging hallmarks, including DNA damage, senescence-associated β-galactosidase, inflammatory cytokine expressions, and impaired myogenic differentiation capacity. Overall, this study highlights the role of proline in mitophagy and its potential in reversing senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and aging hallmarks.

Abstract: Summary
The epigenetic landscape of cancer is regulated by many factors, but primarily it derives from the underlying genome sequence. Chromothripsis is a catastrophic localized genome shattering event that drives, and often initiates, cancer evolution. We characterized five esophageal adenocarcinoma organoids with chromothripsis using long-read sequencing and transcriptome and epigenome profiling. Complex structural variation and subclonal variants meant that haplotype-aware de novo methods were required to generate contiguous cancer genome assemblies. Chromosomes were assembled separately and scaffolded using haplotype-resolved Hi-C reads, producing accurate assemblies even with up to 900 structural rearrangements. There were widespread differences between the chromothriptic and wild-type copies of chromosomes in topologically associated domains, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and gene expression. Differential epigenome peaks were most enriched within 10 kb of chromothriptic structural variants. Alterations in transcriptome and higher-order chromosome organization frequently occurred near differential epigenetic marks. Overall, chromothripsis reshapes gene regulation, causing coordinated changes in epigenetic landscape, transcription, and chromosome conformation.

Abstract: Summary
Insects have an effective innate immune system to protect themselves against fungal invasion. Metarhizium employs a toxin-based strategy using a nonribosomal peptide called destruxin A (DA) to counteract the host immune response. However, the mechanism by which DA inhibits insect immunity is still unclear. Here, we identified 48 DA-binding proteins in silkworm hemolymph, with the binding affinity (KD) ranging from 2 to 420 μM. Among these proteins, hemocytin, an important immune factor, was determined to be the strongest DA-binding protein. DA binds to hemocytin and regulates its conformation in a multisite manner. Furthermore, DA exerts a significant inhibitory effect on hemocytin-mediated hemocyte aggregation. By disrupting the interaction between hemocytin, actin A3, and gelsolin, DA prevents the transformation of granules into vesicles in hemocytes. These vesicles are responsible for storing, maturing, and exocytosing hemocytin. Therefore, hemocytin secretion is reduced, and the formation of structures that promote aggregation in outer hemocytes is inhibited.

Abstract: Summary
Congenital heart malformations include mitral valve defects, which remain largely unexplained. During embryogenesis, a restricted population of endocardial cells within the atrioventricular canal undergoes an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition to give rise to mitral valvular cells. However, the identity and fate decisions of these progenitors as well as the behavior and distribution of their derivatives in valve leaflets remain unknown. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of genetically labeled endocardial cells and microdissected mouse embryonic and postnatal mitral valves to characterize the developmental road. We defined the metabolic processes underlying the specification of the progenitors and their contributions to subtypes of valvular cells. Using retrospective multicolor clonal analysis, we describe specific modes of growth and behavior of endocardial cell-derived clones, which build up, in a proper manner, functional valve leaflets. Our data identify how both genetic and metabolic mechanisms specifically drive the fate of a subset of endocardial cells toward their distinct clonal contribution to the formation of the valve.

Abstract: Summary
Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is the most common intrauterine infection, leading to infant neurodevelopmental disabilities. An improved knowledge of correlates of protection against cCMV is needed to guide prevention strategies. Here, we employ an ex vivo model of human CMV (HCMV) infection in decidual tissues of women with and without preconception immunity against CMV, recapitulating nonprimary vs. primary infection at the authentic maternofetal transmission site. We show that decidual tissues of women with preconception immunity against CMV exhibit intrinsic resistance to HCMV, mounting a rapid activation of tissue-resident memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells upon HCMV reinfection. We further reveal the role of HCMV-specific decidual-tissue-resident CD8+ T cells in local protection against nonprimary HCMV infection. The findings could inform the development of a vaccine against cCMV and provide insights for further studies of the integrity of immune defense against HCMV and other pathogens at the human maternal-fetal interface.

Abstract: Summary
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is best known for its effects in the brain as an orexigenic and anxiolytic agent and in reducing energy expenditure. NPY is also co-expressed with norepinephrine (NE) in sympathetic neurons. Although NPY is generally considered to modulate noradrenergic responses, its specific roles in autonomic physiology remain under-appreciated. Here, we show that sympathetic-derived NPY is essential for metabolic and cardiovascular regulation in mice. NPY and NE are co-expressed in 90% of prevertebral sympathetic neurons and only 43% of paravertebral neurons. NPY-expressing neurons primarily innervate blood vessels in peripheral organs. Sympathetic-specific NPY deletion elicits pronounced metabolic and cardiovascular defects in mice, including reductions in insulin secretion, glucose tolerance, cold tolerance, and pupil size and elevated heart rate, while notably, however, basal blood pressure was unchanged. These findings provide insight into target tissue-specific functions of NPY derived from sympathetic neurons and imply its potential involvement in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Food is a powerful natural reinforcer that guides feeding decisions. The vagus nerve conveys internal sensory information from the gut to the brain about nutritional value; however, the cellular and molecular basis of macronutrient-specific reward circuits is poorly understood. Here, we monitor in vivo calcium dynamics to provide direct evidence of independent vagal sensing pathways for the detection of dietary fats and sugars. Using activity-dependent genetic capture of vagal neurons activated in response to gut infusions of nutrients, we demonstrate the existence of separate gut-brain circuits for fat and sugar sensing that are necessary and sufficient for nutrient-specific reinforcement. Even when controlling for calories, combined activation of fat and sugar circuits increases nigrostriatal dopamine release and overeating compared with fat or sugar alone. This work provides new insights into the complex sensory circuitry that mediates motivated behavior and suggests that a subconscious internal drive to consume obesogenic diets (e.g., those high in both fat and sugar) may impede conscious dieting efforts.

Abstract: Summary
Type I CRISPR-Cas systems utilize the RNA-guided Cascade complex to identify matching DNA targets and the nuclease-helicase Cas3 to degrade them. Among the seven subtypes, type I-C is compact in size and highly active in creating large-sized genome deletions in human cells. Here, we use four cryoelectron microscopy snapshots to define its RNA-guided DNA binding and cleavage mechanisms in high resolution. The non-target DNA strand (NTS) is accommodated by I-C Cascade in a continuous binding groove along the juxtaposed Cas11 subunits. Binding of Cas3 further traps a flexible bulge in NTS, enabling NTS nicking. We identified two anti-CRISPR proteins AcrIC8 and AcrIC9 that strongly inhibit Neisseria lactamica I-C function. Structural analysis showed that AcrIC8 inhibits PAM recognition through allosteric inhibition, whereas AcrIC9 achieves so through direct competition. Both Acrs potently inhibit I-C-mediated genome editing and transcriptional modulation in human cells, providing the first off-switches for type I CRISPR eukaryotic genome engineering.

Abstract: Reliable and effective models for recapitulation of host-pathogen interactions are imperative for the discovery of potential therapeutics. Ex vivo models can fulfill these requirements as the multicellular native environment in the tissue is preserved and be utilized for toxicology, vaccine, infection and drug efficacy studies due to the presence of immune cells. Drug repurposing involves the identification of new applications for already approved drugs that are not related to the prime medical indication and emerged as a strategy to cope with slow pace of drug discovery due to high costs and necessary phases to reach the patients. Within the scope of the study, broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor nafamostat mesylate was repurposed to inhibit influenza A infection and evaluated by a translational ex vivo organotypic model, in which human organ-level responses can be achieved in preclinical safety studies of potential antiviral agents, along with in in vitro lung airway culture. The safe doses were determined as 10 µM for in vitro, whereas 22 µM for ex vivo to be applied for evaluation of host-pathogen interactions, which reduced virus infectivity, increased cell/tissue viability, and protected total protein content by reducing cell death with the inflammatory response. When the gene expression levels of specific pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory and cell surface markers involved in antiviral responses were examined, the significant inflammatory response represented by highly elevated mRNA gene expression levels of cytokines and chemokines combined with CDH5 downregulated by 5.1-fold supported the antiviral efficacy of NM and usability of ex vivo model as a preclinical infection model.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular chaperones are critical for protein homeostasis and are implicated in several human pathologies such as neurodegeneration and cancer. While the binding of chaperones to nascent and misfolded proteins has been studied in great detail, the direct interaction between chaperones and RNA has not been systematically investigated. Here, we provide the evidence for widespread interaction between chaperones and RNA in human cells. We show that the major chaperone heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) binds to non-coding RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III (RNA Pol III) such as tRNA and 5S rRNA. Global chromatin profiling revealed that HSP70 binds genomic sites of transcription by RNA Pol III. Detailed biochemical analyses showed that HSP70 alleviates the inhibitory effect of cognate tRNA transcript on tRNA gene transcription. Thus, our study uncovers an unexpected role of HSP70-RNA interaction in the biogenesis of a specific class of non-coding RNA with wider implications in cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Background
Many studies reported the effects of antibiotic exposure on E. coli bacterial growth and cell modification. However, scarce descriptive information on ultrastructural effects upon exposure of commercial antibiotics.
Methods
This study described the morphological and ultrastructural alterations caused by selected antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, polymyxin B, colistin, gentamicin, and amikacin) that targeted cell wall, plasma membrane, and cytoplasmic density, and also proteins synthesis. We determined extracellular morphological changes of exposure through scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and intracellular activities through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation.
Results
FESEM and TEM micrograph of E. coli exposed with selected antibiotics shows ultrastructural changes in beta-lactam class (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone) elongated the cells as the cell wall was altered as it inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, polymyxin class (polymyxin B, colistin) had plasmid and curli-fimbriae as it breaking down the plasma/cytoplasmic membrane, and aminoglycoside class (gentamicin, and amikacin) reduced ribosome concentration as it inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 30 s ribosomes.
Conclusion
Morphological and ultrastructural alterations of E. coli’s mechanism of actions were translated and depicted. This study could be reference for characterization studies for morphological and ultrastructural of E. coli upon exposure to antimicrobial agents.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging data suggest that induction of viral mimicry responses through activation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensors in cancer cells is a promising therapeutic strategy. One approach to induce viral mimicry is to target molecular regulators of dsRNA sensing pathways. Here, we show that the exoribonuclease XRN1 is a negative regulator of the dsRNA sensor protein kinase R (PKR) in cancer cells with high interferon-stimulated gene expression. XRN1 deletion causes PKR pathway activation and consequent cancer cell lethality. Disruption of interferon signaling with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib can decrease cellular PKR levels and rescue sensitivity to XRN1 deletion. Conversely, interferon-β stimulation can increase PKR levels and induce sensitivity to XRN1 inactivation. Lastly, XRN1 deletion causes accumulation of endogenous complementary sense/anti-sense RNAs, which may represent candidate PKR ligands. Our data demonstrate how XRN1 regulates PKR and how this interaction creates a vulnerability in cancer cells with an activated interferon cell state.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are early signs of metastasis and can be used to monitor disease progression well before radiological detection by imaging. Using an ultrasensitive graphene oxide microfluidic chip nanotechnology built with graphene oxide sheets, we were able to demonstrate that CTCs can be specifically isolated and molecularly characterized to predict future progression in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We analyzed CTCs from 26 patients at six time points throughout the treatment course of chemoradiation followed by immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. We observed that CTCs decreased significantly during treatment, where a larger decrease in CTCs predicted a significantly longer progression-free survival time. Durvalumab-treated patients who have future progression were observed to have sustained higher programmed death ligand 1+ CTCs compared to stable patients. Gene expression profiling revealed phenotypically aggressive CTCs during chemoradiation. By using emerging innovative bioengineering approaches, we successfully show that CTCs are potential biomarkers to monitor and predict patient outcomes in patients with stage III NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
The zona fasciculata (zF) in the adrenal cortex contributes to multiple physiological actions through glucocorticoid synthesis. The size, proliferation, and glucocorticoid synthesis characteristics are all female biased, and sexual dimorphism is established by androgen. In this study, transcriptomes were obtained to unveil the sex differentiation mechanism. Interestingly, both the amount of mRNA and the expressions of nearly all genes were higher in females. The expression of Nr5a1, which is essential for steroidogenic cell differentiation, was also female biased. Whole-genome studies demonstrated that NR5A1 regulates nearly all gene expression directly or indirectly. This suggests that androgen-induced global gene suppression is potentially mediated by NR5A1. Using Nr5a1 heterozygous mice, whose adrenal cortex is smaller than the wild type, we demonstrated that the size of skeletal muscles is possibly regulated by glucocorticoid synthesized by zF. Taken together, considering the ubiquitous presence of glucocorticoid receptors, our findings provide a pathway for sex differentiation through glucocorticoid synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Rapid gut-brain communication is critical to maintain energy balance and is disrupted in diet-induced obesity. In particular, the role of carbohydrate overconsumption in the regulation of interoceptive circuits in vivo requires further investigation. Here, we report that an obesogenic high-sucrose diet (HSD) selectively blunts silencing of hunger-promoting agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons following intragastric delivery of glucose, whereas we previously showed that overconsumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) selectively attenuates lipid-induced neural silencing. By contrast, both HSD and HFD reversibly dampen rapid AgRP neuron inhibition following chow presentation and promote intake of more palatable foods. Our findings reveal that excess sugar and fat pathologically modulate feeding circuit activity in both macronutrient-dependent and -independent ways and thus may additively exacerbate obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Phase separation is a vital mechanism that mediates the formation of biomolecular condensates and their functions. Necroptosis is a lytic form of programmed cell death mediated by RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL downstream of TNFR1 and has been implicated in mediating many human diseases. However, whether necroptosis is regulated by phase separation is not yet known. Here, we show that upon the induction of necroptosis and recruitment by the adaptor protein TAX1BP1, PARP5A and its binding partner RNF146 form liquid-like condensates by multivalent interactions to perform poly ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) and PARylation-dependent ubiquitination (PARdU) of activated RIPK1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We show that PARdU predominantly occurs on the K376 residue of mouse RIPK1, which promotes proteasomal degradation of kinase-activated RIPK1 to restrain necroptosis. Our data demonstrate that PARdU on K376 of mouse RIPK1 provides an alternative cell death checkpoint mediated by phase separation-dependent control of necroptosis by PARP5A and RNF146.

Abstract: Summary
The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in the progression of obesity and diabetes; however, its structural complexity and cellular heterogeneity impede targeted treatments. Here, we profiled the single-cell and spatial transcriptome of the hypothalamus in obese and sporadic type 2 diabetic macaques, revealing primate-specific distributions of clusters and genes as well as spatial region, cell-type-, and gene-feature-specific changes. The infundibular (INF) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) are most susceptible to metabolic disruption, with the PVN being more sensitive to diabetes. In the INF, obesity results in reduced synaptic plasticity and energy sensing capability, whereas diabetes involves molecular reprogramming associated with impaired tanycytic barriers, activated microglia, and neuronal inflammatory response. In the PVN, cellular metabolism and neural activity are suppressed in diabetic macaques. Spatial transcriptomic data reveal microglia’s preference for the parenchyma over the third ventricle in diabetes. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of molecular changes associated with obesity and diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Brain metastasis (BrM) is a common malignancy, predominantly originating from lung, melanoma, and breast cancers. The vasculature is a key component of the BrM tumor microenvironment with critical roles in regulating metastatic seeding and progression. However, the heterogeneity of the major BrM vascular components, namely endothelial and mural cells, is still poorly understood. We perform single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing of sorted vascular cell types and detect multiple subtypes enriched specifically in BrM compared to non-tumor brain, including previously unrecognized immune regulatory subtypes. We integrate the human data with mouse models, creating a platform to interrogate vascular targets for the treatment of BrM. We find that the CD276 immune checkpoint molecule is significantly upregulated in the BrM vasculature, and anti-CD276 blocking antibodies prolonged survival in preclinical trials. This study provides important insights into the complex interactions between the vasculature, immune cells, and cancer cells, with translational relevance for designing therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Due to the multifactorial nature of diabetic wounds, the most effective treatments require combinatorial approach. Herein we investigated whether engraftment of a bioengineered three-dimensional dermal derived matrix scaffold (DDMS) in combination with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSs), could accelerate diabetic wound healing. Diabetic animals were randomly planned into the control group, DDMS group, ADS group, and DDMS+ADS group. On days 7, 14, and 21, tissue samples were obtained for stereological, molecular, and tensiometrical assessments. We found that the wound contraction rate, the total volumes of new epidermis and dermis, the numerical densities of fibroblasts and blood vessels, collagen density, and tensiometrical parameters were meaningfully greater in the treated groups than in the control group, and these changes were more obvious in the DDMS+ADS ones (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression of TGF-β, bFGF, and VEGF genes were considerably upregulated in treated groups compared to the control group and were greater in the DDMS+ADS group (p < 0.05). This is while expression of TNF-α and IL-1β, as well as the numerical densities of neutrophils and macrophages decreased more considerably in the DDMS+ADS group than in the other groups (p < 0.05). Overall, it was found that using both DDMS engraftment and ADS transplantation has more impact on diabetic wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial furrowing is a fundamental morphogenetic process during gastrulation, neurulation, and body shaping. A furrow often results from a fold that propagates along a line. How fold formation and propagation are controlled and driven is poorly understood. To shed light on this, we study the formation of the cephalic furrow, a fold that runs along the embryo dorsal-ventral axis during Drosophila gastrulation and the developmental role of which is still unknown. We provide evidence of its function and show that epithelial furrowing is initiated by a group of cells. This cellular cluster works as a pacemaker, triggering a bidirectional morphogenetic wave powered by actomyosin contractions and sustained by de novo medial apex-to-apex cell adhesion. The pacemaker’s Cartesian position is under the crossed control of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral gene patterning systems. Thus, furrow formation is driven by a mechanical trigger wave that travels under the control of a multidimensional genetic guide.

Abstract: Summary
The brain and gut are intricately connected and respond to various stimuli. Stress-induced brain-gut communication is implicated in the pathogenesis and relapse of gut disorders. The mechanism that relays psychological stress to the intestinal epithelium, resulting in maladaptation, remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a stress-responsive brain-to-gut metabolic axis that impairs intestinal stem cell (ISC) lineage commitment. Psychological stress-triggered sympathetic output enriches gut commensal Lactobacillus murinus, increasing the production of indole-3-acetate (IAA), which contributes to a transferrable loss of intestinal secretory cells. Bacterial IAA disrupts ISC mitochondrial bioenergetics and thereby prevents secretory lineage commitment in a cell-intrinsic manner. Oral α-ketoglutarate supplementation bolsters ISC differentiation and confers resilience to stress-triggered intestinal epithelial injury. We confirm that fecal IAA is higher in patients with mental distress and is correlated with gut dysfunction. These findings uncover a microbe-mediated brain-gut pathway that could be therapeutically targeted for stress-driven gut-brain comorbidities.

Abstract: Summary
Serine metabolism is involved in the fate decisions of immune cells; however, whether and how de novo serine synthesis shapes innate immune cell function remain unknown. Here, we first demonstrated that inflammatory macrophages have high expression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH, the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo serine synthesis) via nuclear factor κB signaling. Notably, the pharmacological inhibition or genetic modulation of PHGDH limits macrophage interleukin (IL)-1β production through NAD+ accumulation and subsequent NAD+-dependent SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression and activity. Mechanistically, PHGDH not only sustains IL-1β expression through H3K9/27 acetylation-mediated transcriptional activation of Toll-like receptor 4 but also supports IL-1β maturation via NLRP3-K21/22/24/ASC-K21/22/24 acetylation-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, mice with myeloid-specific depletion of Phgdh show alleviated inflammatory responses in lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation. This study reveals a network by which a metabolic enzyme, involved in de novo serine synthesis, mediates post-translational modifications and epigenetic regulation to orchestrate IL-1β production, providing a potential inflammatory disease target.

Abstract: Summary
Deficiency of DNA repair pathways drives the development of colorectal cancer. However, the role of the base excision repair (BER) pathway in colorectal cancer initiation remains unclear. This study shows that Nei-like DNA glycosylase 1 (NEIL1) is highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Knocking out neil1 in mice markedly suppresses tumorigenesis and enhances infiltration of CD8+ T cells in intestinal tumors. Furthermore, NEIL1 directly forms a complex with SATB2/c-Myc to enhance the transcription of COL17A1 and subsequently promotes the production of immunosuppressive cytokines in CRC cells. A NEIL1 peptide suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice, and targeting NEIL1 demonstrates a synergistic suppressive effect on tumor growth when combined with a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) inhibitor. These results suggest that combined targeting of NEIL1 and NF-κB may represent a promising strategy for CRC therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are evolutionarily ancient receptors involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Modulators of aGPCR, particularly antagonists, hold therapeutic promise for diseases like cancer and immune and neurological disorders. Hindered by the inactive state structural information, our understanding of antagonist development and aGPCR activation faces challenges. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human CD97, a prototypical aGPCR that plays crucial roles in immune system, in its inactive apo and G13-bound fully active states. Compared with other family GPCRs, CD97 adopts a compact inactive conformation with a constrained ligand pocket. Activation induces significant conformational changes for both extracellular and intracellular sides, creating larger cavities for Stachel sequence binding and G13 engagement. Integrated with functional and metadynamics analyses, our study provides significant mechanistic insights into the activation and signaling of aGPCRs, paving the way for future drug discovery efforts.

Abstract: Reactive nitrogen species (RNS), a mediator of nitrosative stress, plays a vital role during wound healing but its role during tissue regeneration is poorly understood. In the present study, the role of RNS was investigated post-tail autotomy and limb amputation in a gecko species, Hemidactylus murrayi Gleadow, 1887. Tail autotomy led to an increased expression of iNOS and nitrosative stress leading to protein S-nitrosylation that probably restricted the acute inflammatory response caused by wounding. Increased nitrosative stress was also associated with proliferation of the wound epithelium and the tail blastema. Nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) caused retarded growth and structural abnormalities in the regenerating tail while peroxynitrite inhibitor (FeTmPyp) arrested tail regeneration. Spermine NONOate and retinoic acid, used as NO donors generated small outgrowths post-amputation of limbs with an increased number of proliferating cells and s-nitrosylation indicating the role of nitric oxide signalling in cell proliferation during regeneration. Additionally, retinoic acid treatment caused regeneration of nerve, muscle and adipose tissue in the regenerated limb structure 105 days post-amputation suggesting it to be a putative modulator of tissue regeneration in the non-regenerating limbs.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has prioritized understanding bats’ viral tolerance. Myotis bats are exceptionally species rich and have evolved viral tolerance. They also exhibit swarming, a cryptic behavior where large, multi-species assemblages gather for mating, which has been hypothesized to promote interspecific hybridization. To resolve the coevolution of genome architecture and their unusual antiviral tolerance, we undertook a phylogenomic analysis of 60 Old World Myotis genomes. We demonstrate an extensive history of introgressive hybridization that has replaced the species phylogeny across 17%−93% of the genome except for pericentromeric regions of macrochromosomes. Introgression tracts were enriched on microchromosome regions containing key antiviral pathway genes overexpressed during viral challenge experiments. Together, these results suggest that the unusual Myotis karyotype may have evolved to selectively position immune-related genes in high recombining genomic regions prone to introgression of divergent alleles, including a diversity of interleukin loci responsible for the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are phenotypically and functionally diverse in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, how to remodel macrophages with a protumor phenotype and how to manipulate them for therapeutic purposes remain to be explored. Here, we show that in the TME, RARγ is downregulated in macrophages, and its expression correlates with poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). In macrophages, RARγ interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which prevents TRAF6 oligomerization and autoubiquitination, leading to inhibition of nuclear factor κB signaling. However, tumor-derived lactate fuels H3K18 lactylation to prohibit RARγ gene transcription in macrophages, consequently enhancing interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the TME and endowing macrophages with tumor-promoting functions via activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in CRC cells. We identified that nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) exerts effective antitumor action by directly binding to RARγ to inhibit TRAF6-IL-6-STAT3 signaling. This study unravels lactate-driven macrophage function remodeling by inhibition of RARγ expression and highlights NDGA as a candidate compound for treating CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Growing evidence indicates that transposable elements (TEs) play important roles in evolution by providing genomes with coding and non-coding sequences. Identification of TE-derived functional elements, however, has relied on TE annotations in individual species, which limits its scope to relatively intact TE sequences. Here, we report a novel approach to uncover previously unannotated degenerate TEs (degTEs) by probing multiple ancestral genomes reconstructed from hundreds of species. We applied this method to the human genome and achieved a 10.8% increase in coverage over the most recent annotation. Further, we discovered that degTEs contribute to various cis-regulatory elements and transcription factor binding sites, including those of a known TE-controlling family, the KRAB zinc-finger proteins. We also report unannotated chimeric transcripts between degTEs and human genes expressed in embryos. This study provides a novel methodology and a freely available resource that will facilitate the investigation of TE co-option events on a full scale.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA-binding protein SATB2 is genetically linked to human intelligence. We studied its influence on the three-dimensional (3D) epigenome by mapping chromatin interactions and accessibility in control versus SATB2-deficient cortical neurons. We find that SATB2 affects the chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters of neuronal-activity-regulated genes, thus influencing their expression. It also alters A/B compartments, topologically associating domains, and frequently interacting regions. Genes linked to SATB2-dependent 3D genome changes are implicated in highly specialized neuronal functions and contribute to cognitive ability and risk for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Non-coding DNA regions with a SATB2-dependent structure are enriched for common variants associated with educational attainment, intelligence, and schizophrenia. Our data establish SATB2 as a cell-type-specific 3D genome modulator, which operates both independently and in cooperation with CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) to set up the chromatin landscape of pyramidal neurons for cognitive processes.

Abstract: Summary
Histone acetylation affects numerous cellular processes, such as gene transcription, in both plants and animals. However, the posttranslational modification-participated regulatory networks for crop-yield-related traits are largely unexplored. Here, we characterize a regulatory axis for controlling rice grain size and yield, centered on a potent histone acetyltransferase (chromatin modifier) known as HHC4. HHC4 interacts with and forms a ternary complex with adaptor protein ADA2 and transcription factor bZIP23, wherein bZIP23 recruits HHC4 to specific promoters, and ADA2 and HHC4 additively enhance bZIP23 transactivation on target genes. Meanwhile, HHC4 interacts with and is phosphorylated by GSK3-like kinase TGW3. The resultant phosphorylation triggers several functional impairments of the HHC4 ternary complex. In addition, we identify two major phosphorylation sites of HHC4 by TGW3—sites which play an important role in controlling rice grain size. Overall, our findings thus have critical implications for understanding epigenetic basis of grain size control and manipulating the knowledge for higher crop productivity.

Abstract: Summary
Strategies are needed to better identify patients that will benefit from immunotherapy alone or who may require additional therapies like chemotherapy or radiotherapy to overcome resistance. Here we employ single-cell transcriptomics and spatial proteomics to profile triple negative breast cancer biopsies taken at baseline, after one cycle of pembrolizumab, and after a second cycle of pembrolizumab given with radiotherapy. Non-responders lack immune infiltrate before and after therapy and exhibit minimal therapy-induced immune changes. Responding tumors form two groups that are distinguishable by a classifier prior to therapy, with one showing high major histocompatibility complex expression, evidence of tertiary lymphoid structures, and displaying anti-tumor immunity before treatment. The other responder group resembles non-responders at baseline and mounts a maximal immune response, characterized by cytotoxic T cell and antigen presenting myeloid cell interactions, only after combination therapy, which is mirrored in a murine model of triple negative breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor ZNF143 contains a central domain of seven zinc fingers in a tandem array and is involved in 3D genome construction. However, the mechanism by which ZNF143 functions in chromatin looping remains unclear. Here, we show that ZNF143 directionally recognizes a diverse range of genomic sites directly within enhancers and promoters and is required for chromatin looping between these sites. In addition, ZNF143 is located between CTCF and cohesin at numerous CTCF sites, and ZNF143 removal narrows the space between CTCF and cohesin. Moreover, genetic deletion of ZNF143, in conjunction with acute CTCF degradation, reveals that ZNF143 and CTCF collaborate to regulate higher-order topological chromatin organization. Finally, CTCF depletion enlarges direct ZNF143 chromatin looping. Thus, ZNF143 is recruited by CTCF to the CTCF sites to regulate CTCF/cohesin configuration and TAD (topologically associating domain) formation, whereas directional recognition of genomic DNA motifs directly by ZNF143 itself regulates promoter activity via chromatin looping.

Abstract: Summary
The homeostatic regulation of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) activity in yeast involves N-terminal phosphorylation of Orm proteins, while higher eukaryotes lack these phosphorylation sites. Although recent studies have indicated a conserved ceramide-mediated feedback inhibition of the SPT-ORM/ORMDL complex in higher eukaryotes, its conservation and relationship with phosphorylation regulation in yeast remain unclear. Here, we determine the structure of the yeast SPT-Orm2 complex in a dephosphomimetic state and identify an evolutionarily conserved ceramide-sensing site. Ceramide stabilizes the dephosphomimetic Orm2 in an inhibitory conformation, facilitated by an intramolecular β-sheet between the N- and C-terminal segments of Orm2. Moreover, we find that a phosphomimetic mutant of Orm2, positioned adjacent to its intramolecular β-sheet, destabilizes the inhibitory conformation of Orm2. Taken together, our findings suggest that both Orm dephosphorylation and ceramide binding are crucial for suppressing SPT activity in yeast. This highlights a distinctive regulatory mechanism in yeast involving the collaborative actions of phosphorylation and ceramide.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in gene regulation have been linked to the expansion of the human cerebral cortex and to neurodevelopmental disorders, potentially by altering neural progenitor proliferation. However, the effects of genetic variation within regulatory elements on neural progenitors remain obscure. We use sgRNA-Cas9 screens in human neural stem cells (hNSCs) to disrupt 10,674 genes and 26,385 conserved regions in 2,227 enhancers active in the developing human cortex and determine effects on proliferation. Genes with proliferation phenotypes are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and show biased expression in specific fetal human brain neural progenitor populations. Although enhancer disruptions overall have weaker effects than gene disruptions, we identify enhancer disruptions that severely alter hNSC self-renewal. Disruptions in human accelerated regions, implicated in human brain evolution, also alter proliferation. Integrating proliferation phenotypes with chromatin interactions reveals regulatory relationships between enhancers and their target genes contributing to neurogenesis and potentially to human cortical evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms are well-known risk factors for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the combined effects between HLA and EBV on the risk of NPC are unknown. We applied a causal inference framework to disentangle interaction and mediation effects between two host HLA SNPs, rs2860580 and rs2894207, and EBV variant 163364 with a population-based case-control study in NPC-endemic southern China. We discovered the strong interaction effects between the high-risk EBV subtype and both HLA SNPs on NPC risk (rs2860580, relative excess risk due to interaction [RERI] = 4.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.03–6.14; rs2894207, RERI = 3.37, 95% CI = 1.59–5.15), accounting for the majority of genetic risk effects. These results indicate that HLA genes and the high-risk EBV have joint effects on NPC risk. Prevention strategies targeting the high-risk EBV subtype would largely reduce NPC risk associated with EBV and host genetic susceptibility.

Abstract: Summary
In animal cells, molecular pathways often comprise families of variant components, such as ligands or receptors. These pathway components are differentially expressed by different cell types, potentially tailoring pathway function to cell context. However, it has remained unclear how pathway expression profiles are distributed across cell types and whether similar profiles can occur in dissimilar cell types. Here, using single-cell gene expression datasets, we identified pathway expression motifs, defined as recurrent expression profiles that are broadly distributed across diverse cell types. Motifs appeared in core pathways, including TGF-β, Notch, Wnt, and the SRSF splice factors, and involved combinatorial co-expression of multiple components. Motif usage was weakly correlated between pathways in adult cell types and during dynamic developmental transitions. Together, these results suggest a mosaic view of cell type organization, in which different cell types operate many of the same pathways in distinct modes.

Abstract: Objective
To investigate the mechanism of Anwei decoction (AWD) intervention on gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) using a rat model through the endoplasmic reticulum stress–autophagy pathway.
Methods
Gastric intestinal metaplasia was induced in rats using 1‐methyl‐3‐nitro‐1‐nitrosoguanidine. The experiment included a normal control group, a model group, and low‐, medium‐ and high‐dose AWD groups. The specificity of intestinal epithelial cells was determined for model establishment and drug efficacy by detecting the protein expression of markers such as MUC2, VILLIN and CDX2 through western blotting (WB). The effects of AWD on endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy were evaluated by measuring the mRNA and protein expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (PEPK, ATF6, CHOP and caspase‐12) and autophagy markers (LC3Ⅱ and Beclin-1) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the WB method. Furthermore, the ultrastructure of gastric mucosal cells and autophagosome status were observed using transmission electron microscopy.
Results
Compared with the model group, the AWD‐treated rats exhibited significant improvement in body weight (P < 0.01), reduced protein expression of the intestine epithelial cell‐specific markers MUC2, VILLIN, CDX2 and KLF4 (P < 0.01 for all) and increased SOX2 protein expression (P < 0.01). In addition, AWD suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers PEPK and ATF6 (P < 0.01 for all) and promoted the mRNA and protein expression of autophagy and apoptosis markers CHOP, caspase‐12, LC3Ⅱ and Beclin-1 (P < 0.01 for all).
Conclusion
Anwei decoction effectively inhibits the further progression of GIM and prevents the occurrence of gastric mucosal carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) is expressed by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). However, the role of NGFR in the humoral response is not well defined. Here, we study the effect of Ngfr loss on lymph node organization and function, demonstrating that Ngfr depletion leads to spontaneous germinal center (GC) formation and an expansion of the GC B cell compartment. In accordance with this effect, stromal cells are altered in Ngfr−/− mice with a higher frequency of FDCs, characterized by CD21/35, MAdCAM-1, and VCAM-1 overexpression. GCs are located ectopically in Ngfr−/− mice, with lost polarization together with impaired high-affinity antibody production and an increase in circulating autoantibodies. We observe higher levels of autoantibodies in Bcl2 Tg/Ngfr−/− mice, concomitant with a higher incidence of autoimmunity and lower overall survival. Our work shows that NGFR is involved in maintaining GC structure and function, participating in GC activation, antibody production, and immune tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
The glucagon receptor (GCGR) in the kidney is expressed in nephron tubules. In humans and animal models with chronic kidney disease, renal GCGR expression is reduced. However, the role of kidney GCGR in normal renal function and in disease development has not been addressed. Here, we examined its role by analyzing mice with constitutive or conditional kidney-specific loss of the Gcgr. Adult renal Gcgr knockout mice exhibit metabolic dysregulation and a functional impairment of the kidneys. These mice exhibit hyperaminoacidemia associated with reduced kidney glucose output, oxidative stress, enhanced inflammasome activity, and excess lipid accumulation in the kidney. Upon a lipid challenge, they display maladaptive responses with acute hypertriglyceridemia and chronic proinflammatory and profibrotic activation. In aged mice, kidney Gcgr ablation elicits widespread renal deposition of collagen and fibronectin, indicative of fibrosis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an essential role of the renal GCGR in normal kidney metabolic and homeostatic functions. Importantly, mice deficient for kidney Gcgr recapitulate some of the key pathophysiological features of chronic kidney disease.

Abstract: Summary
As a primary target of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, lung exhibits heterogeneous histopathological changes following infection. However, comprehensive insight into their protein basis with spatial resolution remains deficient, which hinders further understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related pulmonary injury. Here, we generate a region-resolved proteomic atlas of hallmark pathological pulmonary structures by integrating histological examination, laser microdissection, and ultrasensitive proteomics. Over 10,000 proteins are quantified across 71 post-mortem specimens. We identify a spectrum of pathway dysregulations in alveolar epithelium, bronchial epithelium, and blood vessels compared with non-COVID-19 controls, providing evidence for transitional-state pneumocyte hyperplasia. Additionally, our data reveal the region-specific enrichment of functional markers in bronchiole mucus plugs, pulmonary fibrosis, airspace inflammation, and alveolar type 2 cells, uncovering their distinctive features. Furthermore, we detect increased protein expression associated with viral entry and inflammatory response across multiple regions, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. Collectively, this study provides a distinct perspective for deciphering COVID-19-caused pulmonary dysfunction by spatial proteomics.

Abstract: Within the developing embryo, cells assemble and remodel their surrounding extracellular matrix during morphogenesis. Fibronectin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein and is a ligand for several members of the Integrin adhesion receptor family. Here, we compare the expression pattern and loss of function phenotypes of the two zebrafish fibronectin paralogs fn1a and fn1b. We engineered two fluorescently tagged knock-in alleles to facilitate live in vivo imaging of the Fibronectin matrix. Genetic complementation experiments indicate that the knock-in alleles are fully functional. Fn1a-mNeonGreen and Fn1b-mCherry are co-localized in ECM fibers on the surface of the paraxial mesoderm and myotendinous junction. In 5-days old zebrafish larvae, Fn1a-mNeonGreen predominantly localizes to the branchial arches, heart ventricle, olfactory placode and within the otic capsule while Fn1b-mCherry is deposited at the pericardium, proximal convoluted tubule, posterior hindgut and at the ventral mesoderm/cardinal vein. We examined Fn1a-mNeonGreen and Fn1b-mCherry in maternal zygotic integrin α5 mutants and integrin β1a; β1b double mutants and find distinct requirements for these Integrins in assembling the two Fibronectins into ECM fibers in different tissues. Rescue experiments via mRNA injection indicate that the two fibronectins are not fully inter-changeable. Lastly, we examined cross-regulation between the two Fibronectins and find fn1a is necessary for normal Fn1b fibrillogenesis in the presomitic mesoderm, but fn1b is dispensable for the normal pattern of Fn1a deposition.

Abstract: Summary
RNF168 plays a central role in the DNA damage response (DDR) by ubiquitylating histone H2A at K13 and K15. These modifications direct BRCA1-BARD1 and 53BP1 foci formation in chromatin, essential for cell-cycle-dependent DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway selection. The mechanism by which RNF168 catalyzes the targeted accumulation of H2A ubiquitin conjugates to form repair foci around DSBs remains unclear. Here, using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and functional assays, we provide a molecular description of the reaction cycle and dynamics of RNF168 as it modifies the nucleosome and recognizes its ubiquitylation products. We demonstrate an interaction of a canonical ubiquitin-binding domain within full-length RNF168, which not only engages ubiquitin but also the nucleosome surface, clarifying how such site-specific ubiquitin recognition propels a signal amplification loop. Beyond offering mechanistic insights into a key DDR protein, our study aids in understanding site specificity in both generating and interpreting chromatin ubiquitylation.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotency can be induced in somatic cells by the expression of OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and MYC. Usually only a rare subset of cells reprogram, and the molecular characteristics of this subset remain unknown. We apply retrospective clone tracing to identify and characterize the rare human fibroblasts primed for reprogramming. These fibroblasts showed markers of increased cell cycle speed and decreased fibroblast activation. Knockdown of a fibroblast activation factor identified by our analysis increased the reprogramming efficiency. We provide evidence for a unified model in which cells can move into and out of the primed state over time, explaining how reprogramming appears deterministic at short timescales and stochastic at long timescales. Furthermore, inhibiting the activity of LSD1 enlarged the pool of cells that were primed for reprogramming. Thus, even homogeneous cell populations can exhibit heritable molecular variability that can dictate whether individual rare cells will reprogram or not.

Abstract: Summary
Functional interplay between the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) and the ubiquitin system underlies the ubiquitin-dependent cargo-sorting pathway of the eukaryotic endomembrane system, yet its evolutionary origin remains unclear. Here, we show that a UEV-Vps23 protein family, which contains UEV and Vps23 domains, mediates an ancient ESCRT and ubiquitin system interplay in Asgard archaea. The UEV binds ubiquitin with high affinity, making the UEV-Vps23 a sensor for sorting ubiquitinated cargo. A steadiness box in the Vps23 domain undergoes ubiquitination through an Asgard E1, E2, and RING E3 cascade. The UEV-Vps23 switches between autoinhibited and active forms, regulating the ESCRT and ubiquitin system interplay. Furthermore, the shared sequence and structural homology among the UEV-Vps23, eukaryotic Vps23, and archaeal CdvA suggest a common evolutionary origin. Together, this work expands our understanding of the ancient ESCRT and ubiquitin system interplay that likely arose antedating divergent evolution between Asgard archaea and eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
That uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is the sole mediator of adipocyte thermogenesis is a conventional viewpoint that has primarily been inferred from the attenuation of the thermogenic output of mice genetically lacking Ucp1 from birth (germline Ucp1−/−). However, germline Ucp1−/− mice harbor secondary changes within brown adipose tissue. To mitigate these potentially confounding ancillary changes, we constructed mice with inducible adipocyte-selective Ucp1 disruption. We find that, although germline Ucp1−/− mice succumb to cold-induced hypothermia with complete penetrance, most mice with the inducible deletion of Ucp1 maintain homeothermy in the cold. However, inducible adipocyte-selective co-deletion of Ucp1 and creatine kinase b (Ckb, an effector of UCP1-independent thermogenesis) exacerbates cold intolerance. Following UCP1 deletion or UCP1/CKB co-deletion from mature adipocytes, moderate cold exposure triggers the regeneration of mature brown adipocytes that coordinately restore UCP1 and CKB expression. Our findings suggest that thermogenic adipocytes utilize non-paralogous protein redundancy—through UCP1 and CKB—to promote cold-induced energy dissipation.

Abstract: Summary
Unlike the adult mammalian heart, which has limited regenerative capacity, the zebrafish heart fully regenerates following injury. Reactivation of cardiac developmental programs is considered key to successfully regenerating the heart, yet the regulation underlying the response to injury remains elusive. Here, we compared the transcriptome and epigenome of the developing and regenerating zebrafish epicardia. We identified epicardial enhancer elements with specific activity during development or during adult heart regeneration. By generating gene regulatory networks associated with epicardial development and regeneration, we inferred genetic programs driving each of these processes, which were largely distinct. Loss of Hif1ab, Nrf1, Tbx2b, and Zbtb7a, central regulators of the regenerating epicardial network, in injured hearts resulted in elevated epicardial cell numbers infiltrating the wound and excess fibrosis after cryoinjury. Our work identifies differences between the regulatory blueprint deployed during epicardial development and regeneration, underlining that heart regeneration goes beyond the reactivation of developmental programs.

Abstract: Summary
Leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) are regarded as the origin of leukemia relapse and therapeutic resistance. Identifying direct stemness determinants that fuel LIC self-renewal is critical for developing targeted approaches. Here, we show that the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 is a crucial stemness factor that promotes LIC self-renewal by attenuating aberrant double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing. Elevated adenosine-to-inosine editing is a common attribute of relapsed T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) regardless of molecular subtype. Consequently, knockdown of ADAR1 severely inhibits LIC self-renewal capacity and prolongs survival in T-ALL patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, ADAR1 directs hyper-editing of immunogenic dsRNA to avoid detection by the innate immune sensor melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Moreover, we uncover that the cell-intrinsic level of MDA5 dictates the dependency on the ADAR1-MDA5 axis in T-ALL. Collectively, our results show that ADAR1 functions as a self-renewal factor that limits the sensing of endogenous dsRNA. Thus, targeting ADAR1 presents an effective therapeutic strategy for eliminating T-ALL LICs.

Abstract: Summary
The Argonaute nuclease from the thermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (PfAgo) contributes to host defense and represents a promising biotechnology tool. Here, we report the structure of a PfAgo-guide DNA-target DNA ternary complex at the cleavage-compatible state. The ternary complex is predominantly dimerized, and the dimerization is solely mediated by PfAgo at PIWI-MID, PIWI-PIWI, and PAZ-N interfaces. Additionally, PfAgo accommodates a short 14-bp guide-target DNA duplex with a wedge-type N domain and specifically recognizes 5′-phosphorylated guide DNA. In contrast, the PfAgo-guide DNA binary complex is monomeric, and the engagement of target DNA with 14-bp complementarity induces sufficient dimerization and activation of PfAgo, accompanied by movement of PAZ and N domains. A closely related Argonaute from Thermococcus thioreducens adopts a similar dimerization configuration with an additional zinc finger formed at the dimerization interface. Dimerization of both Argonautes stabilizes the catalytic loops, highlighting the important role of Argonaute dimerization in the activation and target cleavage.
