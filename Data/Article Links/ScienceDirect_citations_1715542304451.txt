Abstract: Apoptosis is a physiological process that plays a critical maintenance role in cellular homeostasis. Previous reports have demonstrated that cells undergo apoptosis in a cell density-dependent manner, which is regulated, in part, by signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 3. The molecular mechanisms regulating cell density-dependent apoptosis, however, has not been thoroughly investigated to date. Since Notch signaling is activated via direct cell-to-cell contact and plays a pivotal role in cell fate decisions, we examined the role of Notch signaling in cell density-dependent apoptosis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts NIH 3T3 cells. With the increase in cell density, IL-6 expression was induced, which was necessary for STAT3 activation as well as apoptosis regulation. Notch signaling was also activated in a cell-density dependent manner. Blocking Notch signaling either through siRNA-mediated targeting of Jagged1 expression or γ-secretase inhibitor treatment demonstrated that Notch signaling activation was necessary for IL-6 induction. Constitutive activation of Notch signaling via the overexpression of Notch1 intracellular domain was sufficient for the induction of IL-6, which was mediated via direct transcriptional activation. Taken together, our study indicates that Notch signaling regulates cell density-dependent apoptosis through IL-6/STAT3-dependent mechanism. Consequently, Notch signaling might represent a novel therapeutic target in diseases characterized by dysregulated apoptosis.

Abstract: Human anterior gradient-2 (AGR2), a member of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, is present in both intracellular and extracellular compartments. Although AGR2 is overexpressed in various human cancers and reported to promote aggressive tumor features, little is known regarding AGR2′s extracellular functions during tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrate that secreted AGR2 promotes cell migration and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, secreted AGR2 elevated Wnt11 expression, triggering non-canonical Wnt signaling: the Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and c-jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Knockdown of Wnt11 or pretreatment with CaMKII and JNK inhibitors reversed the secreted AGR2′s migration-promoting effect. Further studies revealed that AGR2 antagonized canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling via activating CaMKII. Collectively, our study uncovers a critical role of Wnt11-mediated non-canonical Wnt signaling (CaMKII and JNK pathways) in secreted AGR2′s promoted migration of CRC cells. These results raise the possibility that secreted AGR2 may be a potential therapeutic target towards inhibiting CRC metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Rifamycin monooxygenases (Rox) are present in a variety of environmental bacteria and are associated with decomposition of the clinically utilized antibiotic rifampin. Here we report the structure and function of a drug-inducible rox gene from Streptomyces venezuelae, which encodes a class A flavoprotein monooxygenase that inactivates a broad range of rifamycin antibiotics. Our findings describe a mechanism of rifamycin inactivation initiated by monooxygenation of the 2-position of the naphthyl group, which subsequently results in ring opening and linearization of the antibiotic. The result is an antibiotic that no longer adopts the basket-like structure essential for binding to the RNA exit tunnel of the target RpoB, thereby providing the molecular logic of resistance. This unique mechanism of enzymatic inactivation underpins the broad spectrum of rifamycin resistance mediated by Rox enzymes and presents a new antibiotic resistance mechanism not yet seen in microbial antibiotic detoxification.

Abstract: Summary
The identification of cell surface proteins on stem cells or stem cell derivatives is a key strategy for the functional characterization, isolation, and understanding of stem cell population dynamics. Here, using an integrated mass spectrometry- and microarray-based approach, we analyzed the surface proteome and transcriptome of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) generated from the stage-specific differentiation of mouse and human pluripotent stem cells. Through bioinformatics analysis, we have identified and characterized FZD4 as a marker for lateral plate mesoderm. Additionally, we utilized FZD4, in conjunction with FLK1 and PDGFRA, to further purify CPCs and increase cardiomyocyte (CM) enrichment in both mouse and human systems. Moreover, we have shown that NORRIN presented to FZD4 further increases CM output via proliferation through the canonical WNT pathway. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a role for FZD4 in mammalian cardiac development.

Abstract: Macrophage polarization is involved in the process of inflammation. Regulation of macrophage polarization is considered to be an effective method for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases. In our study, we investigated the potential molecular mechanism of the flavonoid compound LZ205, which exhibits anti-inflammatory property. Results showed that LZ205 significantly reduced M1 macrophage-associated proinflammatory cytokines secretion by regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway without affecting M2 macrophage-associated cytokines mRNA levels. In vivo studies showed that LZ205 significantly inhibited M1 macrophages polarization in DSS-induced colitis and alum-induced murine peritonitis. Consistent with in vitro studies, LZ205 significantly blocked expression of PI3K, p-AKT and p-mTOR in colon tissues and peritoneal macrophages. Taken together, LZ205 exerts anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization via regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
In vivo hematopoietic generation occurs in waves of primitive and definitive cell emergence. Differentiation cultures of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) offer an accessible source of hematopoietic cells for blood-related research and therapeutic strategies. However, despite many approaches, it remains a goal to robustly generate hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells (HP/SCs) in vitro from ESCs. This is partly due to the inability to efficiently promote, enrich, and/or molecularly direct hematopoietic emergence. Here, we use Gata2Venus (G2V) and Ly6a(SCA1)GFP (LG) reporter ESCs, derived from well-characterized mouse models of HP/SC emergence, to show that during in vitro differentiation they report emergent waves of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), definitive HPCs, and B-lymphoid cell potential. These results, facilitated by enrichment of single and double reporter cells with HPC properties, demonstrate that in vitro ESC differentiation approximates the waves of hematopoietic cell generation found in vivo, thus raising possibilities for enrichment of rare ESC-derived HP/SCs.

Abstract: Background
Oral manifestations may be the first signs of hematologic diseases, and may occur due to the disease itself or to treatment.
Objective
To evaluate the frequency and types of oral conditions presented by patients on a hematology ward.
Methods
Data were collected by oral examinations during weekly visits to a hematology ward. Six trained dentists performed the oral assessment based on the principles of oral semiology. All patients who accepted to be examined were included in the study. Patients who were unavailable or unable to have oral examinations were excluded. Data were recorded on protocol forms and in the electronic records of the institution. A descriptive analysis was performed.
Results
Seventy-nine patients were included in the analysis; 50.6% were female and the mean age was 41.49 years. The most common reasons for hospitalization were chemotherapy and complications (81%), relapse (13.9%) and pre-transplant preparation (5%). The most frequent underlying diseases were multiple myeloma (17.7%), acute myeloid leukemia (15.4%) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (11.5%). Oral conditions were found in 36 (45.6%) patients, some of whom presented more than one condition. The most common oral conditions were dry lips (12.6%), mucositis (10.1%), petechiae (8.9%) and candidiasis (7.6%). Of the detected oral conditions, 56.9% were related to the underlying disease or chemotherapy and 20.2% were not related to the disease.
Conclusion
This study shows the types and frequency of oral conditions observed in hematological inpatients. Awareness of these conditions is important for prevention and planning the care of patients with hematological diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from pluripotent stem cells, in vitro, holds great promise for regenerative therapies. Primarily, this has been achieved in mouse cells by overexpression of the homeotic selector protein HOXB4. The exact cellular stage at which HOXB4 promotes hematopoietic development, in vitro, is not yet known. However, its identification is a prerequisite to unambiguously identify the molecular circuits controlling hematopoiesis, since the activity of HOX proteins is highly cell and context dependent. To identify that stage, we retrovirally expressed HOXB4 in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Through the use of Runx1(−/−) ESCs containing a doxycycline-inducible Runx1 coding sequence, we uncovered that HOXB4 promoted the formation of hemogenic endothelium cells without altering endothelial cell development. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed that its expression mediated the upregulation of transcription of core transcription factors necessary for hematopoiesis, culminating in the formation of blood progenitors upon initiation of Runx1 expression.

Abstract: Summary
The epithelial compartment of the mammary gland contains basal and luminal cell lineages, as well as stem and progenitor cells that reside upstream in the differentiation hierarchy. Stem and progenitor cell differentiation is regulated to maintain adult tissue and mediate expansion during pregnancy and lactation. The genetic factors that regulate the transition of cells between differentiation states remain incompletely understood. Here, we present a genome-scale method to discover genes driving cell-state specification. Applying this method, we identify a transcription factor, BCL11B, which drives stem cell self-renewal in vitro, by inhibiting differentiation into the basal lineage. To validate BCL11B's functional role, we use two-dimensional colony-forming and three-dimensional tissue differentiation assays to assess the lineage differentiation potential and functional abilities of primary human mammary cells. These findings show that BCL11B regulates mammary cell differentiation and demonstrate the utility of our proposed genome-scale strategy for identifying lineage regulators in mammalian tissues.

Abstract: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a familial progressive degenerative disorder and is caused by mutations in NOTCH3 gene. Previous study reported that mutant NOTCH3 is more prone to form aggregates than wild-type NOTCH3 and the mutant aggregates are resistant to degradation. We hypothesized that aggregation or accumulation of NOTCH3 could be due to impaired lysosomal-autophagy machinery in VSMC. Here, we investigated the possible cause of accumulation/aggregation of NOTCH3 in CADASIL using cerebral VSMCs derived from control and CADASIL patients carrying NOTCH3R133C mutation. Thioflavin-S-staining confirmed the increased accumulation of aggregated NOTCH3 in VSMCR133C compared to VSMCWT. Increased levels of the lysosomal marker, Lamp2, were detected in VSMCR133C, which also showed co-localization with NOTCH3 using double-immunohistochemistry. Increased level of LC3-II/LC3-I ratio was observed in VSMCR133C suggesting an accumulation of autophagosomes. This was coupled with the decreased co-localization of NOTCH3 with LC3, and Lamp2 and, further, increase of p62/SQSTM1 levels in VSMCR133C compared to the VSMCWT. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated phosphorylation of p-ERK, p-S6RP, and p-P70 S6K. Altogether, these results suggested a dysfunction in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in VSMCR133C. The present study provides an interesting avenue of the research investigating the molecular mechanism of CADASIL.

Abstract: Objectives
To determine the frequency of folic acid deficiency in consecutive serum folate determinations and to determine whether there was a significant decrease in serum folate deficiency after folate was added to wheat flour.
Methods
A retrospective descriptive observational study was performed of consecutive folate measurements at the Hospital Privado Universitario, Cordoba, Argentina.
Results
Two cohorts were analyzed: 1197 folate measurements between 2001 and 2008 (before supplementation) and 3335 folate measurements from 2009 to 2014 (after supplementation). Folate deficiency was found in 84/1197 (7%) subjects in the pre-supplementation group and in 58/3335 (1.73%) after supplementation. The prevalence of folate deficiency was 12% between 2001 and 2003 when folate was not added to flour compared to 4% in 2004–2007 (p-value<0.0001) when folate was added to the flour but no widespread use was documented.
Conclusions
In the studied population, the prevalence of serum folic acid deficiency after folate supplementation was low at 1.73%. There was a significant decrease in folate deficiency after folate was added to wheat flour. Given the low prevalence of folic acid deficiency observed in this and similar studies, and the observed change with supplementation, we conclude that routine measurement of serum folate is of limited clinical use.

Abstract: Summary
The bifunctional farnesyl/geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS/GGPPS) is a key branchpoint enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis in Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) parasites. PfFPPS/GGPPS is a validated, high-priority antimalarial drug target. Unfortunately, current bisphosphonate drugs that inhibit FPPS and GGPPS enzymes by acting as a diphosphate substrate analog show poor bioavailability and selectivity for PfFPPS/GGPPS. We identified a new non-bisphosphonate compound, MMV019313, which is highly selective for PfFPPS/GGPPS and showed no activity against human FPPS or GGPPS. Inhibition of PfFPPS/GGPPS by MMV019313, but not bisphosphonates, was disrupted in an S228T variant, demonstrating that MMV019313 and bisphosphonates have distinct modes of inhibition. Molecular docking indicated that MMV019313 did not bind previously characterized substrate sites in PfFPPS/GGPPS. Our finding uncovers a new, selective small-molecule binding site in this important antimalarial drug target with superior druggability compared with the known inhibitor site and sets the stage for the development of Plasmodium-specific FPPS/GGPPS inhibitors.

Abstract: hnRNP A1 acts as a critical splicing factor in regulating many alternative splicing events in various physiological and pathophysiological progressions. hnRNP A1 is capable of regulating UVB-induced hdm2 gene alternative splicing according to our previous study. However, the biological function and underlying molecular mechanism of hnRNP A1 in cell survival and cell cycle in response to UVB irradiation are still unclear. In this study, silencing hnRNP A1 expression by siRNA transfection led to decreased cell survival after UVB treatment, while promoting hnRNP A1 by lentiviruse vector resulted in increased cell survival. hnRNP A1 remarkably enhanced PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by increasing phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and P70S6 protein. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling by LY294002 suppressed the expression of hnRNP A1. While mTOR signaling inhibitors, rapamycin and AZD8055, did not influence hnRNP A1 expression in HaCaT cells, suggesting that hnRNP A1 may be an upstream mediator of mTOR signaling. Furthermore, hnRNP A1 could alleviate UVB-provoked cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and promoted cell cycle progression at G2/M phase. Our results indicate that hnRNP A1 promotes cell survival and cell cycle progression following UVB radiation.

Abstract: Summary
As resistance to antibiotics increases, the exploration of new targets and strategies to combat pathogenic bacteria becomes more urgent. Ideal protein targets are required for viability across many species, are unique to prokaryotes to limit effects on the host, and have robust assays to quantitate activity and identify inhibitors. Lipoprotein signal peptidase (Lsp) is a transmembrane aspartyl protease required for lipoprotein maturation and comprehensively fits these criteria. Here, we have developed the first in vitro high-throughput assay to monitor proteolysis by Lsp. We employed our high-throughput screen assay against 646,275 compounds to discover inhibitors of Lsp and synthesized a range of analogs to generate molecules with nanomolar half maximal inhibitory concentration values. Importantly, our inhibitors are effective in preventing the growth of E. coli cultures in the presence of outer-membrane permeabilizer PMBN and should facilitate development of antibacterial agents with a novel mechanism of action to treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Transition from primed to naive pluripotency is associated with dynamic changes in transposable element (TE) expression and demethylation of imprinting control regions (ICRs). In mouse, ICR methylation and TE expression are each regulated by TRIM28; however, the role of TRIM28 in humans is less clear. Here, we show that a null mutation in TRIM28 causes significant alterations in TE expression in both the naive and primed states of human pluripotency, and phenotypically this has limited effects on self-renewal, instead causing a loss of germline competency. Furthermore, we discovered that TRIM28 regulates paternal ICR methylation and chromatin accessibility in the primed state, with no effects on maternal ICRs. Taken together, our study shows that abnormal TE expression is tolerated by self-renewing human pluripotent cells, whereas germline competency is not.

Abstract: The different facets of macrophages allow them to play distinct roles in tissue homeostasis, tissue repair and in response to infections. Individuals displaying dysregulated macrophage functions are proposed to be prone to inflammatory disorders or infections. However, this being a cause or a consequence of the pathology remains often unclear. In this context, we isolated and expanded CD34+ HSCs from healthy blood donors and derived them into CD14+ myeloid progenitors which were further enriched and differentiated into macrophages. Aiming for a comprehensive phenotypic profiling, we generated whole-cell mass spectrometry (WCMS) fingerprints of cell samples collected along the different stages of the differentiation process to build a predictive model using a linear discriminant analysis based on principal components. Through the capacity of the model to accurately predict sample's identity of a validation set, we demonstrate that WCMS profiles obtained from bona fide blood monocytes and respectively derived macrophages mirror profiles obtained from equivalent HSC derivatives. Finally, HSC-derived macrophage functionalities were assessed by quantifying cytokine and chemokine responses to a TLR agonist in a 34-plex luminex assay and by measuring their capacity to phagocytise mycobacteria. These functional read-outs could not discriminate blood monocytes-derived from HSC-derived macrophages. To conclude, we propose that this method opens new avenues to distinguish the impact of human genetics on the dysregulated biological properties of macrophages in pathological conditions.

Abstract: The atypical Rho GTPase RhoD has previously been shown to have a major impact on the organization and function of the actin filament system. However, when first discovered, RhoD was found to regulate endosome trafficking and dynamics and we therefore sought to investigate this regulation in more detail. We found that exogenously expressed RhoD in human fibroblasts localized to vesicles and the plasma membrane and that the active GTP-bound conformation was required for the plasma membrane localization but not for vesicle localization. In contrast to the GTPase deficient atypical Rho GTPases, which have a stalled GTPase activity, RhoD has an elevated intrinsic GDP/GTP exchange activity, rendering the protein constitutively active. Importantly, RhoD can still hydrolyze GTP and we found that an intact GTPase activity was required for efficient fusion of RhoD-positive vesicles. RhoD has a unique N-terminal extension of 14 amino acid residues, which is not present in the classical Rho GTPases RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1. Deletion of this N-terminal motif often lead to clustering of RhoD positive vesicles, which were found accumulated at the peripheral membrane border. In addition, the number of vesicles per cell was increased manifold, suggesting that the N-terminal motif has an important regulatory role in vesicle dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
The fluorescent protein (FP) color palette has greatly contributed to the visualization of molecular and cellular processes. However, most FPs lose fluorescence at a pH lower than their neutral pKa (∼6), and this has hampered their application in acidic organelles (pH ∼4.5–6.0). Currently, several cyan- and red-colored acid-tolerant FPs are available; however, there are few reports of acid-tolerant green FPs (GFPs) that are practically applicable to bioimaging. Here, we developed the acid-tolerant monomeric GFP “Gamillus” from the jellyfish Olindias formosa, with excellent brightness, maturation speed, and photostability. Results from X-ray crystallography and point mutagenesis suggest that across a broad pH range the acid tolerance is attributed to stabilization of deprotonation in the chromophore phenyl ring by forming a unique trans configuration. We demonstrate that Gamillus can serve as a molecular tag suitable for imaging in acidic organelles through autophagy-mediated molecular tracking to lysosomes.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors play particularly important roles in many organisms. The novel Drosophila gene anchor is an orthologue of vertebrate GPR155. However, the roles of anchor in molecular functions and biological processes, especially in wing development, remain unknown. Knockdown of anchor resulted in an increased wing size and additional and thickened veins. These abnormal wing phenotypes were similar to those observed in BMP signalling gain-of-function experiments. We observed that the BMP signalling indicator p-Mad was significantly increased in wing discs in which anchor RNAi was induced in larvae and accumulated abnormally in intervein regions in pupae. Furthermore, the expression of target genes of the BMP signalling pathway was examined using a lacZ reporter, and the results indicated that omb and sal were substantially increased in anchor-knockdown wing discs. An investigation of genetic interactions between Anchor and the BMP signalling pathway revealed that the thickened and ectopic vein tissues were rescued by knocking down BMP levels. These results suggested that Anchor functions to negatively regulate BMP signalling during wing development and vein formation.

Abstract: Summary
The unique relapsing nature of Plasmodium vivax infection is a major barrier to malaria eradication. Upon infection, dormant liver-stage forms, hypnozoites, linger for weeks to months and then relapse to cause recurrent blood-stage infection. Very little is known about hypnozoite biology; definitive biomarkers are lacking and in vitro platforms that support phenotypic studies are needed. Here, we recapitulate the entire liver stage of P. vivax in vitro, using a multiwell format that incorporates micropatterned primary human hepatocyte co-cultures (MPCCs). MPCCs feature key aspects of P. vivax biology, including establishment of persistent small forms and growing schizonts, merosome release, and subsequent infection of reticulocytes. We find that the small forms exhibit previously described hallmarks of hypnozoites, and we pilot MPCCs as a tool for testing candidate anti-hypnozoite drugs. Finally, we employ a hybrid capture strategy and RNA sequencing to describe the hypnozoite transcriptome and gain insight into its biology.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hold great promise for understanding kidney development and disease. We reproducibly differentiated three genetically distinct wild-type hPSC lines to kidney precursors that underwent rudimentary morphogenesis in vitro. They expressed nephron and collecting duct lineage marker genes, several of which are mutated in human kidney disease. Lentiviral-transduced hPSCs expressing reporter genes differentiated similarly to controls in vitro. Kidney progenitors were subcutaneously implanted into immunodeficient mice. By 12 weeks, they formed organ-like masses detectable by bioluminescence imaging. Implants included perfused glomeruli containing human capillaries, podocytes with regions of mature basement membrane, and mesangial cells. After intravenous injection of fluorescent low-molecular-weight dextran, signal was detected in tubules, demonstrating uptake from glomerular filtrate. Thus, we have developed methods to trace hPSC-derived kidney precursors that formed functioning nephrons in vivo. These advances beyond in vitro culture are critical steps toward using hPSCs to model and treat kidney diseases.

Abstract: Iron deficiency complicates the use of red cell indices to screen for carriers of haemoglobin variants in many populations. In a cross sectional survey of 7526 secondary school students from 25 districts of Sri Lanka, 1963 (26.0%) students had low red cell indices. Iron deficiency, identified by low serum ferritin, was the major identifiable cause occurring in 550/1806 (30.5%) students. Low red cell indices occurred in iron-replete students with alpha-thalassaemia including those with single alpha-globin gene deletions. Anaemia and low red cell indices were also common in beta-thalassaemia trait. An unexpected finding was that low red cell indices occurred in 713 iron-replete students with a normal haemoglobin genotype. It is common practice to prescribe iron supplements to individuals with low red cell indices. Since low red cell indices were a feature of all forms of α thalassaemia and also of iron deficiency, in areas where both conditions are common, such as Sri Lanka, it is imperative to differentiate between the two, to allow targeted administration of iron supplements and avoid the possible deleterious effects of increased iron availability in iron replete individuals with low red cell indices due to other causes such as α thalassaemia.

Abstract: Nematocysts are characteristic organelles of the phylum cnidaria. They are designated kleptocnidae when sequestered in animals that feed on cnidaria. Kleptocnidae are known for more than a century. Nevertheless it is still enigmatic how selected nematocyst types survive in the predator and how they reach their final destination in the foreign body. In the free-living Platyhelminth Microstomum lineare the fate of nematocysts of the prey Hydra oligactis was analyzed at the ultrastructural level and by fluorescence microscopy using hydra polyps that had been stained in vivo with the fluorescent dyes TROMI and TRITC. M. lineare digested hydra tissue in its intestine within 30 min and all nematocyst types were phagocytosed without adherent cytoplasm by intestinal cnidophagocytes. Desmoneme and isorhiza nematocysts were digested whereas cnidophagocytes containing the venom-loaded stenotele nematocysts started to migrate out of the intestinal epithelia through the parenchyma to the epidermis thereby traversing the subintestinal and subepidermal muscle layer. Within one to two days, M. lineare began to form a muscle layer basolateral around epidermal cnidophagocytes. Epidermal stenoteles survived in M. lineare for at least four weeks. The ability of epidermal stenotele nematocysts to discharge suggest that this hydra organelle preserved its physiological properties in the new host.

Abstract: Mitochondria are increasingly recognized as key mediators of acute cellular stress responses in asthma. However, the distinct roles of regulators of mitochondrial physiology on allergic asthma phenotypes are currently unknown. The mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) resides in the inner mitochondrial membrane and controls mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondrial matrix. To understand the function of MCU in models of allergic asthma, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed using models of functional deficiency or knockout of MCU. In primary human respiratory epithelial cells, MCU inhibition abrogated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, preserved the mitochondrial membrane potential and protected from apoptosis in response to the pleiotropic Th2 cytokine IL-13. Consequently, epithelial barrier function was maintained with MCU inhibition. Similarly, the endothelial barrier was preserved in respiratory epithelium isolated from MCU-/- mice after exposure to IL-13. In the ovalbumin-model of allergic airway disease, MCU deficiency resulted in decreased apoptosis within the large airway epithelial cells. Concordantly, expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1 was preserved, indicative of maintenance of epithelial barrier function. These data implicate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through MCU as a key controller of epithelial cell viability in acute allergic asthma.

Abstract: Human stromal stem cells (hMSCs) differentiate into adipocytes that play a role in skeletal tissue homeostasis and whole body energy metabolism. During adipocyte differentiation, hMSCs exhibit significant changes in cell morphology suggesting changes in cytoskeletal organization. Here, we examined the effect of direct modulation of actin microfilament dynamics on adipocyte differentiation. Stabilizing actin filaments in hMSCs by siRNA-mediated knock down of the two main actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs): Cofilin 1 (CFL1) and Destrin (DSTN) or treating the cells by Phalloidin reduced adipocyte differentiation as evidenced by decreased number of mature adipocytes and decreased adipocyte specific gene expression (ADIPOQ, LPL, PPARG, FABP4). In contrast, disruption of actin cytoskeleton by Cytochalasin D enhanced adipocyte differentiation. Follow up studies revealed that the effects of CFL1 on adipocyte differentiation depended on the activity of LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) which is the major upstream kinase of CFL1. Inhibiting LIMK by its specific chemical inhibitor LIMKi inhibited the phosphorylation of CFL1 and actin polymerization, and enhanced the adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, treating hMSCs by Cytochalasin D inhibited ERK and Smad2 signaling and this was associated with enhanced adipocyte differentiation. On the other hand, Phalloidin enhanced ERK and Smad2 signaling, but inhibited adipocyte differentiation which was rescued by ERK specific chemical inhibitor U0126. Our data provide a link between restructuring of hMSCs cytoskeleton and hMSCs lineage commitment and differentiation.

Abstract: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease characterized by high pulmonary artery pressure. It is reported that microRNA-204 (miR-204) plays an important role in the development of PAH. Calcitriol [1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25(OH)2D3] mediates multiple pathophysiological processes. The aim of the current study was to explore the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 in PAH. PAH was induced in rats and rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) were isolated as in vitro PAH model. The mean pulmonary artery pressure, morphologic changes, and expressions of transforming growth factor-beta1 (Tgfbr2), Smad2/7, alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and p21 were then measured. Furthermore, the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on rat PAECs with or without hypoxia treatment was also assessed by measuring the proliferation, migration, and cell cycle distribution of PAECs. The potential targets of miR-204 were also predicted and validated with a dual-luciferase reporter system. Then the role of miR-204 and Tgfbr2 in the anti-PAH effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 was further explored by modulating the expression of the two genes. The overall pulmonary hypertension and hypoxia-induced proliferation and migration of PAECs were attenuated by administration of 1,25(OH)2D3, which was associated with the suppressed expressions of Tgfbr2, α-SMA, and Smad7 and induced expressions of miR-204, p21 and Smad2 both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the luciferase reporter assay identified Tgfbr2 as a novel direct target of miR-204. Both overexpression of miR-204 and inhibition of Tgfbr2 would strengthen the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 administration. Findings outlined in the current study demonstrated that 1,25(OH)2D3 was a promising therapeutic modality for treatment of PAH, function of which was exerted through miR-204 mediated Tgfbr2 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanisms of flavin reduction and hydrogen peroxide production by KMO inhibitors are unknown. Herein, we report the structure of human KMO and crystal structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (sc) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (pf) KMO with Ro 61-8048. Proton transfer in the hydrogen bond network triggers flavin reduction in p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, but the mechanism triggering flavin reduction in KMO is different. Conformational changes via π-π interactions between the loop above the flavin and substrate or non-substrate effectors lead to disorder of the C-terminal α helix in scKMO and shifts of domain III in pfKMO, stimulating flavin reduction. Interestingly, Ro 61-8048 has two different binding modes. It acts as a competitive inhibitor in scKMO and as a non-substrate effector in pfKMO. These findings provide understanding of the catalytic cycle of KMO and insight for structure-based drug design of KMO inhibitors.

Abstract: Object
This study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA OIP5-AS1 in regulating radioresistance of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.
Methods
Microarray analysis was used to screen out lncRNAs differentially expressed in radio-resistant CRC cell lines. Expression levels of OIP5-AS1, miR-369-3p and DYRK1A in CRC cell lines were measured by qRT-PCR. Protein expression of DYRK1A was determined by western blot. The target relationships among OIP5-AS1, miR-369-3p and DYRK1A were validated by dual luciferase reporter assay. Impacts of OIP5-AS1 or DYRK1A on CRC cellular activity and apoptosis were investigated by MTT assay, clonogenic survival assay and flow cytometry to analyze OIP5-AS1 or DYRK1A’s effect on radioresistance of CRC cells.
Results
LncRNA OIP5-AS1 and DYRK1A were down-regulated in radio-resistant CRC cell lines. OIP5-AS1 suppressed the expression of miR-369-3p, thus up-regulating DYRK1A, the downstream gene of miR-369-3p. OIP5-AS1 and DYRK1A impaired cell clonogenic survival and promoted cell apoptosis after irradiation, improving radiosensitivity of CRC cells.
Conclusion
LncRNA OIP5-AS1 suppressed cell viability, promoted radio-induced apoptosis, and enhanced the radiosensitivity of CRC cells by regulating DYRK1A expression through miR-369-3p.

Abstract: Growth arrest specific 1 (GAS1) is a signaling mediator for the development of the central nervous system that works as a co-receptor for sonic hedgehog (SHH) to induce the amplification of neural progenitors during the patterning of the mammalian neural tube and establishing granular cells in the cerebellum. Recently, we confirmed that Gas1 is also expressed by neural progenitors of the developing cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The presence of GAS1 in progenitor stages indicates that one of its principal roles is the maintenance of these cells during neurogenic events. However, the signals responsible for the expression of Gas1 in progenitor cells are unknown, an aspect that is relevant to understand its functions during neurogenesis. Here, we focused on elucidating the mechanisms of the transcriptional regulation of Gas1 and using comparative genomics methods found two highly conserved E-boxes in the Gas1 promoter which mediate its up-regulation by NeuroD1. Additionally, we found that GAS1 and NeuroD1 co-localize in the neocortex, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the external granular layer of the cerebellum, suggesting a previously unsuspected regulatory relationship. Our data indicate that Gas1 is a direct target of NeuroD1 during the induction of the neurogenic program.

Abstract: Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) display puzzling inter-individual phenotypic heterogeneity, conceivably related to inherent differences in antioxidant protection, hemoglobin binding, bilirubin catabolism and methyl group handling. Therefore, we explored putative associations between clinically important phenotypic measures and functional polymorphisms within specific candidate genes encoding glutathione S-transferase, haptoglobin, uridine 5′-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, methyl tetrahydrofolate reductase, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase, and cystathionine beta-synthase. Two-hundred and thirty SCD participants (mean age 25.1 ± 2.8) were recruited from Jamaica's Annual Sickle Cell Unit Cohort Review – two-hundred and five had homozygous hemoglobin SS (HbSS) disease, twenty-five had hemoglobin SC (HbSC) disease. Regression analyses revealed some novel genotype-phenotype associations. HbSC participants had significantly lower mean lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.01) and glutathione (p < 0.001) values than HbSS participants. Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) was significantly associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration using univariate (p = 0.044) and multivariable regression (p = 0.012). 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) was significantly associated with hemoglobin F % using univariate (p = 0.010) and multivariable regression (p = 0.009). In conclusion, this exploratory cross-sectional study generated novel, useable, and informative genotype-phenotype estimates of association, but larger studies are needed to determine whether these specific variants are related to inter-individual phenotypic variability in SCD.

Abstract: Background
Zika, a disease caused by Zika virus infections, has recently emerged and caused outbreaks in many parts of the world. The clinical manifestations of Zika are usually mild, mostly presenting as an exanthematic febrile disease, but on some occasions, it might be associated with microcephaly after intrauterine infection, and Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Zika virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bites, but other means of transmission have been described, and potential risk for blood transmission has been reported in French Polynesia and Brazil.
Methods
To investigate the risk of Zika virus infection after a blood transfusion in an area of Brazil where a possible transmission by a platelet concentrate has been described. Using a mini-pool format, 1857 blood donations were evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction designed to detect Zika virus RNA.
Results
After testing samples individually from positive mini-pools, the prevalence of Zika virus RNA was only 0.16%, a result probably associated to the low circulation of this virus in the study area. In addition, it was evident that the implementation of post-surveillance programs is important to detect Zika virus infections in blood donors, as the post-donation surveillance program detected two blood donors with the disease in this study.
Conclusion
This study shows that the risk for Zika virus transmission by blood transfusion is real, even in regions with a low circulation of the disease, but the combination of the detection of Zika virus RNA by polymerase chain reaction and post-donation surveillance might reduce the risk of transmission by blood transfusions.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder with no disease-modifying treatment. Expansion of the glutamine-encoding repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene causes broad effects that are a challenge for single treatment strategies. Strategies based on human stem cells offer a promising option. We evaluated efficacy of transplanting a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-grade human embryonic stem cell-derived neural stem cell (hNSC) line into striatum of HD modeled mice. In HD fragment model R6/2 mice, transplants improve motor deficits, rescue synaptic alterations, and are contacted by nerve terminals from mouse cells. Furthermore, implanted hNSCs are electrophysiologically active. hNSCs also improved motor and late-stage cognitive impairment in a second HD model, Q140 knockin mice. Disease-modifying activity is suggested by the reduction of aberrant accumulation of mutant HTT protein and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in both models. These findings hold promise for future development of stem cell-based therapies.

Abstract: Herein we report a case series of seven newborn infants, all apparently well at birth, who in the period since 2009 were cared for in the State of Utah with acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE). This report summarizes our attempts to define common features of these seven through a state-wide voluntary registry, as a step toward devising new means of preventing such cases in the future. In previous reports of ABE, many of the affected neonates had no clearly defined explanation for their progressive hyperbilirubinemia. Our efforts to identify clear explanations in all seven cases included next generation DNA sequencing, testing a panel of 28 genes involved in bilirubin production and metabolism. We found that hemolytic disease was a unifying feature of these seven; two had DAT (+) Anti-D or anti-c hemolysis, while five had confirmed mutations in genes involved in bilirubin production and or metabolism that were previously unrecognized in these families.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to identify the clinical features and prognosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) in China. This single center study enrolled 111 subjects visited in Peking University People's hospital including 62 males and 49 females. Among them, IgG subtype, IgA subtype and IgM subtype were 56.31%, 28.16%, 5.83% respectively. 10.7% patients had the abnormality of convectional cytogenetic testing, while the interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) made the positive rate increased to 18.9%, and IgH rearrangement was most common. The positive rate of MAGE-C1/CT7 was 73.8% in MGUS, but the expression level was 0.33%, lower than that in MM. After a median follow-up of 15.9 months, 5 cases were determined disease progression (PD), and 1 patient had died of disease progression, two died of the complication. MGUS is becoming increasingly important in China. Male had higher prevalence of MGUS, the most common subtype was IgG, and the IgA subtype was much higher which may be related to the air pollution. MGUS patients had a high positive rate of MAGE-C1/CT7 gene, but the expression level was low. Some patients with MGUS could progress to MM, systemic amyloidosis and other malignant diseases.

Abstract: Epidemiological studies implicate stress as an important factor contributing to the increasing prevalence of metabolic disorders. Studies have correlated visceral obesity and atherosclerosis with hyper-cortisolemia, a sequela of chronic psychological stress in humans and animals. Although several hormonal markers of stress have been associated with various metabolic disorders, the mechanism by which these hormones alter metabolic functions have not been established. We used an in vitro model system, culturing 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and RAW 264.7 macrophages in the presence or absence of cortisol, to analyze cell signaling pathways mediating changes in metabolic functions. Our analysis revealed that cortisol up-regulated the expression and function of two serotonin (S) receptors, HTR2c and HTR5a. HTR2c and HTR5a were also directly involved in mediating cortisol enhanced adipogenesis when pre-adipocytes were cultured alone or in the presence of macrophages. Finally, cortisol treatment of pre-adipocytes co-cultured with macrophages enhanced adipogenesis in both macrophages and pre-adipocytes.

Abstract: Progress towards an in-depth understanding of the final steps of the erythroid lineage development is paramount for many hematological diseases. We have characterized the final stages of reticulocyte maturation from bone marrow to peripheral blood using for the first time single-cell Mass Cytometry (CyTOF). We were able to measure the expression of 31 surface markers within a single red blood cell (RBC). We demonstrate the validity of CyTOF for RBC phenotyping by confirming the progressive reduction of transferrin receptor 1 (CD71) during reticulocyte maturation to mature RBC. We highlight the high-dimensional nature of mass cytometry data by correlating the expression of multiple proteins on individual RBCs. We further describe a more drastic reduction pattern for a component of the alpha4/beta1 integrin CD49d at the very early steps of reticulocyte maturation in bone marrow and directly linked with the mitochondria remnants clearance pattern. The enhanced and accurate RBC phenotyping potential of CyTOF described herein could be beneficial to decipher RBC preferences, as well as still not well understood receptor-ligand interaction of some hemotropic parasites such as the malaria causing agent Plasmodium vivax.

Abstract: Wound healing is regulated by a complex network of cells, molecules, and cytokines, as well as microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs were confirmed to influence the wound healing process, and miR-21, an important member of the miRNA family, was also shown to regulate wound healing. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of miR-21 in the wound healing process and the possible underlying cell signaling pathways. We isolated GMSCs from WT and miR-21-KO mouse gingiva. Flow cytometric analysis and immunocytofluorescense staining were used to identify the GMSCs acquired from WT and miR-21-KO mice. RT-PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistofluorescence staining were performed to examine the expression of extracellular matrix components and key proteins of cell signaling pathways. TargetScan and pmiR-RB-REPORT vectors were used to verify that Smad7 was a direct target of miR-21. Compared to WT mice, miR-21-KO mice showed slower wound healing. RT-PCR and western blot analysis indicated that Elastin expression was downregulated in miR-21-deficient samples. We confirmed that Smad7 was a direct target of miR-21. miR-21 knockout resulted in increased expression of Smad7 and impaired phosphorylation of the Smad2/3 complex. The expression of the Smad7-Smad2/3-Elastin axis in palate tissues sections acquired from WT and miR-21-KO mice showed the same trend. Based on all these results, we demonstrated that miR-21 promoted the wound healing process via the Smad7-Smad2/3-Elastin pathway.

Abstract: Calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role in angiogenesis, as it activates the cell migration machinery. Different proangiogenic factors have been demonstrated to induce transient Ca2+ increases in endothelial cells. This has raised interest in the contribution of Ca2+ channels to cell migration, and in a possible use of channel-blocking compounds in angiogenesis-related pathologies. We have investigated the ability of erythropoietin (Epo), a cytokine recently involved in angiogenesis, to induce Ca2+ influx through different types of membrane channels in EA.hy926 endothelial cells. The voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel antagonists amlodipine and diltiazem inhibited an Epo-triggered transient rise in intracellular Ca2+, similarly to a specific inhibitor (Pyr3) and a blocking antibody against the transient potential calcium channel 3 (TRPC3). Unlike diltiazem, amlodipine and the TRPC3 inhibitors prevented the stimulating action of Epo in cell migration and in vitro angiogenesis assays. Amlodipine was also able to inhibit an increase in endothelial cell migration induced by Epo in an inflammatory environment generated with TNF-α. These results support the participation of Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent and transient potential channels in Epo-driven endothelial cell migration, highlighting the antiangiogenic activity of amlodipine.

Abstract: Summary
The RNAi pathway confers antiviral immunity in insects. Virus-specific siRNA responses are amplified via the reverse transcription of viral RNA to viral DNA (vDNA). The nature, biogenesis, and regulation of vDNA are unclear. We find that vDNA produced during RNA virus infection of Drosophila and mosquitoes is present in both linear and circular forms. Circular vDNA (cvDNA) is sufficient to produce siRNAs that confer partially protective immunity when challenged with a cognate virus. cvDNAs bear homology to defective viral genomes (DVGs), and DVGs serve as templates for vDNA and cvDNA synthesis. Accordingly, DVGs promote the amplification of vDNA-mediated antiviral RNAi responses in infected Drosophila. Furthermore, vDNA synthesis is regulated by the DExD/H helicase domain of Dicer-2 in a mechanism distinct from its role in siRNA generation. We suggest that, analogous to mammalian RIG-I-like receptors, Dicer-2 functions like a pattern recognition receptor for DVGs to modulate antiviral immunity in insects.

Abstract: Summary
Generating an unlimited source of human insulin-producing cells is a prerequisite to advance β cell replacement therapy for diabetes. Here, we describe a 3D culture system that supports the expansion of adult human pancreatic tissue and the generation of a cell subpopulation with progenitor characteristics. These cells display high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDHhi), express pancreatic progenitors markers (PDX1, PTF1A, CPA1, and MYC), and can form new organoids in contrast to ALDHlo cells. Interestingly, gene expression profiling revealed that ALDHhi cells are closer to human fetal pancreatic tissue compared with adult pancreatic tissue. Endocrine lineage markers were detected upon in vitro differentiation. Engrafted organoids differentiated toward insulin-positive (INS+) cells, and circulating human C-peptide was detected upon glucose challenge 1 month after transplantation. Engrafted ALDHhi cells formed INS+ cells. We conclude that adult human pancreatic tissue has potential for expansion into 3D structures harboring progenitor cells with endocrine differentiation potential.

Abstract: Summary
Quiescent neural stem cells (qNSCs) with radial morphology are the only proven source of new neurons in the adult mammalian brain. Our understanding of the roles of newly generated neurons depends on the ability to target and manipulate adult qNSCs. Although various strategies have been developed to target and manipulate adult hippocampal qNSCs, they often suffer from prolonged breeding, low recombination efficiency, and non-specific labeling. Therefore, developing a readily manufactured viral vector that allows flexible packaging and robust expression of various transgenes in qNSCs is a pressing need. Here, we report a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 4 (rAAV4)-based toolkit that preferentially targets hippocampal qNSCs and allows for lineage tracing, functional analyses, and activity manipulation of adult qNSCs. Importantly, targeting qNSCs in a non-Cre-dependent fashion opens the possibility for studying qNSCs in less genetically tractable animal species and may have translational impact in gene therapy by preferentially targeting qNSCs.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous disease, with biologically and prognostically different subtypes. Although a growing number of distinct AML subsets have been increasingly characterized, patient management has remained disappointingly uniform. The molecular mechanism underlying AML needs to be further investigated. Here we identify IRF9 as a negative regulator of human AML. We show that IRF9 mRNA and protein levels are down-regulated in human AML samples compared with samples from healthy donors. IRF9 knockdown promotes proliferation, colony formation and survival of OCI/AML-2 and OCI/AML-3 cells, whereas IRF9 overexpression obtains oppose results. Mechanism analysis shows that IRF9 binds SIRT1 promoter and represses SIRT1 expression in OCI/AML-2 and OCI/AML-3 cells. In AML samples, the expression of SIRT1 is up-regulated and negatively correlated with IRF9 level. IRF9 also increases the acetylation of p53, a deacetylation substrate of SIRT1, and promotes the expression of p53 target genes. Knockdown of p53 blocks the effects of IRF9 on cell survival and growth in vitro. These findings provide evidence that IRF9 serves as an important regulator in human AML by repressing SIRT1-p53 pathway and that IRF9 may be a potential target for AML treatment.

Abstract: Summary
So far, opposing outcomes have been reported following neonatal apex resection in mice, questioning the validity of this injury model to investigate regenerative mechanisms. We performed a systematic evaluation, up to 180 days after surgery, of the pathophysiological events activated upon apex resection. In response to cardiac injury, we observed increased cardiomyocyte proliferation in remote and apex regions, neovascularization, and local fibrosis. In adulthood, resected hearts remain consistently shorter and display permanent fibrotic tissue deposition in the center of the resection plane, indicating limited apex regrowth. However, thickening of the left ventricle wall, explained by an upsurge in cardiomyocyte proliferation during the initial response to injury, compensated cardiomyocyte loss and supported normal systolic function. Thus, apex resection triggers both regenerative and reparative mechanisms, endorsing this injury model for studies aimed at promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation and/or downplaying fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Scarce access to primary samples and lack of efficient protocols to generate oligodendrocytes (OLs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are hampering our understanding of OL biology and the development of novel therapies. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of the transcription factor SOX10 is sufficient to generate surface antigen O4-positive (O4+) and myelin basic protein-positive OLs from hPSCs in only 22 days, including from patients with multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The SOX10-induced O4+ population resembles primary human OLs at the transcriptome level and can myelinate neurons in vivo. Using in vitro OL-neuron co-cultures, myelination of neurons by OLs can also be demonstrated, which can be adapted to a high-throughput screening format to test the response of pro-myelinating drugs. In conclusion, we provide an approach to generate OLs in a very rapid and efficient manner, which can be used for disease modeling, drug discovery efforts, and potentially for therapeutic OL transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Adrenomedullary chromaffin cells are catecholamine (CA)-producing cells originating from trunk neural crest (NC) via sympathoadrenal progenitors (SAPs). We generated NC and SAPs from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in vitro via BMP2/FGF2 exposure, ascertained by qPCR and immunoexpression of SOX10, ASCL1, TFAP2α, and PHOX2B, and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting selection for p75NTR and GD2, and confirmed their trunk-like HOX gene expression. We showed that continuing BMP4 and curtailing FGF2 in vitro, augmented with corticosteroid mimetic, induced these cells to upregulate the chromaffin cell-specific marker PNMT and other CA synthesis and storage markers, and we demonstrated noradrenaline and adrenaline by Faglu and high-performance liquid chromatography. We showed these human cells' SAP-like property of migration and differentiation into cells expressing chromaffin cell markers by implanting them into avian embryos in vivo and in chorio-allantoic membrane grafts. These cells have the potential for investigating differentiation of human chromaffin cells and for modeling diseases involving this cell type.

Abstract: Summary
Non-human primates (NHPs) can serve as a human-like model to study cell therapy using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). However, whether the efficacy of NHP and human iPSC-CMs is mechanistically similar remains unknown. To examine this, RNU rats received intramyocardial injection of 1 × 107 NHP or human iPSC-CMs or the same number of respective fibroblasts or PBS control (n = 9–14/group) at 4 days after 60-min coronary artery occlusion-reperfusion. Cardiac function and left ventricular remodeling were similarly improved in both iPSC-CM-treated groups. To mimic the ischemic environment in the infarcted heart, both cultured NHP and human iPSC-CMs underwent 24-hr hypoxia in vitro. Both cells and media were collected, and similarities in transcriptomic as well as metabolomic profiles were noted between both groups. In conclusion, both NHP and human iPSC-CMs confer similar cardioprotection in a rodent myocardial infarction model through relatively similar mechanisms via promotion of cell survival, angiogenesis, and inhibition of hypertrophy and fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranslational modifications of histones play key roles in the dynamic regulation of chromatin structure. Lysine succinylation is a new type of histone modification, but its biological significance in chromatin structure and dynamics remains unknown. Here we develop a chemical approach to site-specifically install a succinyl lysine analog into histones. This analog serves as an ideal structural and functional mimic to natural succinyl lysine. The incorporation of this succinylation mimic into histone H2B at lysine 34, a succinylation site at the nucleosomal DNA-histone interface, leads to significant decrease in nucleosome stability in vitro, which is consistent with the defects in chromatin structure of a budding yeast strain containing a lysine-to-glutamate mutation at the corresponding residue of yeast histone H2B. This study provides a simple method for the rapid generation of histones with site-specific succinylation mimics, and reveals novel regulatory mechanisms of histone succinylation in the dynamic organization of chromatin.

Abstract: X-ray repair cross-complementing group 4 (XRCC4), a repair protein for DNA double-strand breaks, is cleaved by caspases during apoptosis. In this study, we examined the role of XRCC4 in apoptosis. Cell lines, derived from XRCC4-deficient M10 mouse lymphoma cells and stably expressing wild-type XRCC4 or caspase-resistant XRCC4, were established and treated with staurosporine (STS) to induce apoptosis. In STS-induced apoptosis, expression of wild-type, but not caspase-resistant, XRCC4 in XRCC4-deficient cells enhanced oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the appearance of TUNEL-positive cells by promoting nuclear translocation of caspase-activated DNase (CAD), a major nuclease for oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. CAD activity is reportedly regulated by the ratio of two inhibitor of CAD (ICAD) splice variants, ICAD-L and ICAD-S mRNA, which, respectively, produce proteins with and without the ability to transport CAD into the nucleus. The XRCC4-dependent promotion of nuclear import of CAD in STS-treated cells was associated with reduction of ICAD-S mRNA and protein, and enhancement of phosphorylation and nuclear import of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor (SRSF) 1. These XRCC4-dependent, apoptosis-enhancing effects were canceled by depletion of SRSF1 or SR protein kinase (SRPK) 1. In addition, overexpression of SRSF1 in XRCC4-deficient cells restored the normal level of apoptosis, suggesting that SRSF1 functions downstream of XRCC4 in activating CAD. This XRCC4-dependent, SRPK1/SRSF1-mediated regulatory mechanism was conserved in apoptosis in Jurkat human leukemia cells triggered by STS, and by two widely used anti-cancer agents, Paclitaxel and Vincristine. These data imply that the level of XRCC4 expression could be used to predict the effects of apoptosis-inducing drugs in cancer treatment.

Abstract: During early development in placental mammals, proper trophoblast lineage development is essential for implantation and placentation. Defects in this lineage can cause early pregnancy failures and other pregnancy disorders. However, transcription factors controlling trophoblast development remain poorly understood. Here, we utilize Fosl1, previously implicated in trophoblast giant cell development as a member of the AP-1 complex, to trans-differentiate embryonic stem (ES) cells to trophoblast lineage-like cells. We first show that the ectopic expression of Fosl1 is sufficient to induce trophoblast-specific gene expression programs in ES cells. Surprisingly, we find that this transcriptional reprogramming occurs independently of changes in levels of ES cell core factors during the cell fate change. This suggests that Fosl1 acts in a novel way to orchestrate the ES to trophoblast cell fate conversion compared to previously known reprogramming factors. Mapping of Fosl1 targets reveals that Fosl1 directly activates TE lineage-specific genes as a pioneer factor. Our work suggests Fosl1 may be used to reprogram ES cells into differentiated cell types in trophoblast lineage, which not only enhances our knowledge of global trophoblast gene regulation but also may provide a future therapeutic tool for generating induced trophoblast cells from patient-derived pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
The existence of slow-cycling luminal cells in the prostate has been suggested, but their identity and functional properties remain unknown. Using a bigenic mouse model to earmark, isolate, and characterize the quiescent stem-like cells, we identify a label-retaining cell (LRC) population in the luminal cell layer as luminal progenitors. Molecular and biological characterizations show that these luminal LRCs are significantly enriched in the mouse proximal prostate, exhibit relative dormancy, display bipotency in both in vitro and in vivo assays, and express a stem/progenitor gene signature with resemblance to aggressive prostate cancer. Importantly, these LRCs, compared with bulk luminal cells, maintain a lower level of androgen receptor (AR) expression and are less androgen dependent and also castration resistant in vivo. Finally, analysis of phenotypic markers reveals heterogeneity within the luminal progenitor cell pool. Our study establishes luminal LRCs as progenitors that may serve as a cellular origin for castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Abstract: Background
This study investigated the association of Robin Sequence with ABO and RhD blood group phenotypes.
Methods
A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed of a cohort of Robin Sequence patients of the Hospital de Reabilitação de Anomalias Craniofaciais – Universidade de São Paulo (USP), Brazil. The study group was composed of 339 individuals of both genders with Robin Sequence referred for specific treatment. A control group was composed of 1780 individuals without syndromes. The groups were compared using the Pearson’ chi-square test (χ2) with statistical significance being defined for an alpha error of 5% (p-value<0.05).
Results
A comparison of gender found a significant difference for the AB phenotype between groups (p-value=0.007). Comparing blood type by gender there was no significant difference within the same group (p-value=0.117 and 0.388 respectively, for Robin Sequence and the control group). When comparing the AB blood type between groups, there was no difference for females (p-value=0.577), but there was a significant difference for males (p-value=0.0029).
Conclusions
This study showed that the population with Robin Sequence had different patterns related to gender concerning the phenotypic distribution of ABO and RhD blood group phenotypes. Robin Sequence is more common among females. The AB phenotype was significantly higher in males with Robin Sequence than in males of the Control Group. The prevalence of the RhD-negative phenotype is higher in individuals with Robin Sequence. This result suggests a possible association of ABO and RhD phenotypes with Robin Sequence that should be better investigated by molecular studies, as it deserves greater attention.

Abstract: Asthma is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome characterized by airway inflammation, hyper-responsiveness and remodeling. Airway remodeling is irreversible by current antiasthmatic drugs, and it is the main cause of severe asthma. Airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) act as the main effector cells for airway remodeling; the proliferation and hypertrophy of which are involved in airway remodeling. Caveolin (Cav)− 1 is present on the surface of ASMCs, which is involved in cell cycle and signal transduction regulation, allowing ASMCs to change from proliferation to apoptosis. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signaling pathway is a common pathway regulated by various proliferative factors, which demonstrates a regulatory role in airway remodeling of asthma. There have been many studies on the correlation between vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and airway reactivity and inflammation in asthma, but the functions and related mechanisms of ASMCs remain unclear. In this study, we established an airway remodeling model in asthmatic mice, and concluded that VIP inhibits airway remodeling in vivo. The in vitro effect of VIP on interleukin-13-induced proliferation of ASMCs was studied by examining the effects of VIP on expression of ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2 and Cav-1 in ASMCs, as well as changes in cell cycle distribution. VIP inhibited phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and expression of Cav-1 on ASMCs and decreased the proportion of S phase cells in the cell cycle, thus inhibiting the proliferation of ASMCs. This study provides a novel therapeutic mechanism for the treatment of asthma.

Abstract: mRNA translation is regulated by diverse mechanisms that converge at the initiation and elongation steps to determine the rate, profile, and localization of proteins synthesized. A consistently relevant feature of these mechanisms is the spatial re-distribution of translation machinery, a process of particular importance in neural cells. This process has, however, been largely overlooked with respect to its potential role in regulating the local concentration of cytoplasmic tRNAs, even as a multitude of data suggest that spatial regulation of the tRNA pool may help explain the remarkably high rates of peptide elongation. Here, we report that Cy3/Cy5-labeled bulk tRNAs transfected into neural cells distribute into granule-like structures – “tRNA granules” – that exhibit dynamic mixing of tRNAs between granules and rapid, bi-directional vectorial movement within neurites. Imaging of endogenous tRNAgly and tRNAlys by fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed a similar granular distribution of tRNAs in somata and neurites; this distribution was highly overlapping with granules imaged by introduction of exogenous Cy5-tRNAthr and Cy3-tRNAval. A subset of tRNA granules located in the cell body, neurite branch points and growth cones displayed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Cy3 and Cy5-labeled tRNAs indicative of translation, and co-localization with elongation machinery. A population of smaller, rapidly trafficked granules in neurites lacked FRET and showed poor colocalization with translation initiation and elongation factors, suggesting that they are a translationally inactive tRNA transport particle. Our data suggest that tRNAs are packaged into granules that are rapidly transported to loci where translation is needed, where they may greatly increase the local concentration of tRNAs in support of efficient elongation. The potential implications of this newly described structure for channeling of elongation, local translation, and diseases associated with altered tRNA levels or function are discussed.

Abstract: Cystatin F is an inhibitor of cysteine peptidases expressed solely in immune cells. It is the only type II cystatin able to enter endosomal/lysosomal vesicles and to regulate directly the activity of intracellular cysteine cathepsins. Its expression in promonocytic U937 and promyeloblastic HL-60 cells is highly upregulated but, after differentiation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate – PMA, its levels drop significantly. In contrast, the activities of intracellular cysteine cathepsins C, L and S are higher in differentiated cells than in non-differentiated ones due, presumably, to the lower inhibitory capacity of cystatin F. Using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, proximity ligation assay and co-immunoprecipitation, cathepsins C, L and S were confirmed to be the main interacting partners of cystatin F in U937 and HL-60 cells. The promoter region of the cystatin F gene, CST7, contains a unique binding site for transcription factor C/EBP α, one of the main myeloid differentiation instructors. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, C/EBP α was shown to bind to CST7 gene in U937 cells. Following cell differentiation with PMA, the binding of C/EBP α was decreased significantly. The protein level of C/EBP α was also significantly lower in differentiated than in non-differentiated cells. It was shown that, during monocyte to macrophage differentiation, the endosomal/lysosomal proteolytic activity can be regulated by cystatin F whose expression is under the control of transcriptional factor C/EBP α.

Abstract: Summary
Progressive kidney diseases affect approximately 500 million people worldwide. Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filter, the loss of which leads to disease progression and kidney failure. To date, there are no therapies to promote podocyte survival. Drug repurposing may therefore help accelerate the development of cures in an area of tremendous unmet need. In a newly developed high-throughput screening assay of podocyte viability, we identified the BRAFV600E inhibitor GDC-0879 and the adenylate cyclase agonist forskolin as podocyte-survival-promoting compounds. GDC-0879 protects podocytes from injury through paradoxical activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. Forskolin promotes podocyte survival by attenuating protein biosynthesis. Importantly, GDC-0879 and forskolin are shown to promote podocyte survival against an array of cellular stressors. This work reveals new therapeutic targets for much needed podocyte-protective therapies and provides insights into the use of GDC-0879-like molecules for the treatment of progressive kidney diseases.

Abstract: Osteoclasts are the main cells responsible for the resorption of mineralized extracellular matrices. They are the major targets for anti-resorptive therapies to manage osteoporosis, a major public health problem. Osteoclasts are giant multinucleated cells that can organize their a unique adhesion structure based on a belt of podosomes, which is the keystone of the bone resorption apparatus. We combined differential transcriptomics and siRNA screening approaches to get a broader view of cytoskeletal regulators that participate in the control of osteoclast cytoskeleton and identify novel regulators of bone resorption by osteoclasts. We identified 20 new candidate regulators of osteoclasts cytoskeleton including Fkbp15, Spire1, Tacc2 and RalA, for which we confirmed they are necessary for proper organization of the podosome belt. We also showed that Anillin, well known for its role during cytokinesis, is essential in osteoclasts for correct podosome patterning and efficient bone resorption. In particular, Anillin controls the levels of the GTPase RhoA, a known regulator of osteoclast cytoskeleton and resorption activity. Finally, we set up and validated an automated imaging strategy based on open-source software for automatic and objective measurement of actin cytoskeleton organization in osteoclasts. We provide these pipelines that are useful to automatically assess the effect of collections of siRNAs or chemical compounds on osteoclast cytoskeleton or differentiation.

Abstract: Previously, we reported that vitamin A deficiency resulted in the reduction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) levels, which corroborated with attenuation of high fructose-induced hepatic steatosis. Here, we aimed at assessing the effect of vitamin A deficiency on SCD1, MUFA levels and their impact on pancreas’ structure and functions. Male weanling Wistar rats fed one of the four diets, namely control (Con), vitamin A-deficient (VAD), highfructose (HFr) and vitamin A-deficient diet with highfructose (VADHFr) for 16 weeks period. Compared to the control, feeding of VAD diet (alone or with HFr) resulted in pancreatic intra-islet vessel dilation and reduced plasma insulin, glucagon and C-peptide levels, however, glucose levels decreased only in VADHFr group. In line with plasma levels, VAD diet-fed animals displayed lower immunostaining for insulin and glucagon, which corroborated with increased apoptotic staining observed in the islet regions, possibly due to increased cellular stress, as indicated by high immunostaining for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and CCAAT/Enhancer-binding protein homologues protein (CHOP). On the other hand, it significantly decreased the SCD1 protein, which corroborated with reduced MUFA levels, particularly, oleic acid (C18:1), when compared to the control and HFr groups. In conclusion, chronic vitamin A deficiency altered the structure and functions of pancreas by diminishing the islet cells, possibly by inducing cellular stress-mediated apoptosis and decreasing SCD1-mediated oleic acid (C18:1) synthesis. Thus, the data suggest that unlike liver, the reduction in SCD1 and MUFA levels in the pancreas exerts deleterious effects on its functions and perturb the overall cellular metabolism.

Abstract: African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) endure bouts of severe drought in their natural habitats and survive the loss of approximately 30% of total body water due to dehydration. To investigate molecular mechanisms employed by X. laevis during periods of dehydration, the heat shock protein response, a vital component of the cytoprotective stress response, was characterized. Using western immunoblotting and multiplex technology, the protein levels of HSP27, HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, HSC70, and HSP90 were quantified in the liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, and testes from control frogs and those that underwent medium or high dehydration (~16 or ~30% loss of total body water). Dehydration increased HSP27 (1.45–1.65-fold) in the kidneys and lungs, and HSP40 (1.39–2.50-fold) in the liver, testes, and skeletal muscle. HSP60 decreased in response to dehydration (0.43–0.64 of control) in the kidneys and lungs. HSP70 increased in the liver, lungs, and testes (1.39–1.70-fold) during dehydration, but had a dynamic response in the kidneys (levels increased 1.57-fold with medium dehydration, but decreased to 0.56 of control during high dehydration). HSC70 increased in the liver and kidneys (1.20–1.36-fold), but decreased in skeletal muscle (0.27–0.55 of control) during dehydration. Lastly, HSP90 was reduced in the kidney, lung, and skeletal muscle (0.39–0.69 of control) in response to dehydration, but rose in the testes (1.30-fold). Overall, the results suggest a dynamic tissue-specific heat shock protein response to whole body dehydration in X. laevis.

Abstract: Diabetic vascular complications are often defined by vascular endothelial lesions. However, as a plastic cell type, whether endothelial cells could transit from quiescence to hyper-active status and hamper vascular stability upon hyperglycemia stimulation and whether this process is involved in diabetic vascular complications remain obscure. Survivin has been identified as an anti-apoptotic protein in tumor or epithelial cells by either promoting proliferation or inhibiting apoptosis. Therefore, this study aims at investigating the effects of hyperglycemia on endothelial cell status and the potential involvement of survivin. We found that high glucose (25 mM) did not cause endothelial injuries, instead, it evidently promotes endothelial proliferation and tube formation capacity indicating endothelial cell dysfunction upon hyperglycemia characterized by its preference to hyper-active status. Concomitantly, an upregulation of survivin was detected accompanied by the key component elevations of autophagy pathway including LC3, Beclin1, and p62. YM155, a specific inhibitor of survivin, could abrogate hyperglycemia-induced endothelial hyper-activation. Application of the autophagy inhibitor (3MA) and agonist (rapamycin) supported that survivin could be as a downstream effect or of autophagy. Thus, our results suggested that survivin/autophagy axis a potential therapeutic target in treatment of diabetic vascular complications.

Abstract: Summary
Lung epithelial cells (LECs) are strategically positioned in the airway mucosa to provide barrier defense. LECs also express pattern recognition receptors and a myriad of immune genes, but their role in immunity is often concealed by the activities of “professional” immune cells, particularly in the context of fungal infection. Here, we demonstrate that NF-κB signaling in LECs is essential for immunity against the pulmonary fungal pathogen Blastomyces dermatitidis. LECs orchestrate innate antifungal immunity by augmenting the numbers of interleukin-17A (IL-17A)- and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-producing innate lymphocytes, specifically “natural” Th17 (nTh17) cells. Innate lymphocyte-derived IL-17A and GM-CSF in turn enable phagocyte-driven fungal killing. LECs regulate the numbers of nTh17 cells via the production of chemokines such as CCL20, a process dependent on IL-1α-IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling on LECs. Therefore, LECs orchestrate IL-17A- and GM-CSF-mediated immunity in an IL-1R-dependent manner and represent an essential component of innate immunity to pulmonary fungal pathogens.

Abstract: The spermatogonial transplantation technique was developed by Dr. Ralph Brinster in 1994. Transplanted spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) produce germ cell colonies after microinjection into the seminiferous tubules of infertile mice. This technique provided the first functional assay for SSCs. Although it became possible to produce transgenic animals using this transplantation technique in 2001, the lack of SSC culture systems prevented efficient genetic manipulation. To overcome this problem, a long-term SSC culture technique was developed in 2003. Cultured SSCs, designated as germline stem cells, allow drug selection of transfected SSCs, and knockout mice were produced in 2006. Using these techniques, it is now possible to address basic biological questions of SSC biology. They also open up new possibilities for male germline manipulation. In this review, we will briefly summarize our findings on SSCs and discuss unresolved issues that remain to be addressed.

Abstract: Background
Recent studies have revealed that mutation in KCNE1, β-subunits of cardiac potassium channel, involved in ventricular fibrillation. Whereas its role in early repolarization syndrome (ERS) is less well understood.
Objective
To study whether mutant in KCNE1 is associated with ERS and explore the possible underlying molecular mechanisms.
Methods
Whole genome from four unrelated families with ERS was amplified and sequenced. Wild-type (WT) KCNE1 and/or KCNE1-S38G (S38G) were expressed in HEK293 cells with KCNQ1. Functional studies included whole-cell patch-clamp, western blot and immunofluorescence were performed to reveal the possible underlying mechanisms.
Results
The co-expression of KCNE1-S38G and KCNQ1 decreased tail current density of IKs but had little effect in modulation channel kinetics of IKs. Compared with KCNE1-WT, the expression and membrane location of KCNE1-S38G decreased. Co-expression of KCNE1-WT and KCNE1-S38G partially rescued the function of IKs channel.
Conclusions
The S38G mutation induced a loss-of-function of IKs due to decreasing of KCNE1 protein expression and defecting in KCNE1 protein membrane trafficking. Our findings suggested that KCNE1 may be one of the possible modulatory genes associated to ERS.

Abstract: Summary
The regulatory mechanisms that control neural stem cell (NSC) activation in the adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) stem cell niche have been the focus of intense investigation, yet how the niche first develops and organizes is poorly understood. Here, we examined matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for potential roles in V-SVZ stem cell niche development. MMP12 was found to promote appropriate niche cellular arrangements, the formation of specialized niche extracellular matrix, and the translational planar cell polarity of ependymal cells that surround and support niche NSCs. Surprisingly, ependymal cells were found to have an intracellular pool of MMP12 that promoted ependymal cell ciliogenesis by upregulating FOXJ1. In addition, both extracellular and intracellular MMP12 were found to regulate V-SVZ niche output by promoting NSC quiescence. These findings reveal that extracellular and intracellular MMP12 have both unique and overlapping roles that help orchestrate the development of the adult V-SVZ stem cell niche.

Abstract: Summary
During Salmonella-induced gastroenteritis, mucosal inflammation creates a niche that favors the expansion of the pathogen population over the microbiota. Here, we show that Salmonella Typhimurium infection was accompanied by dysbiosis, decreased butyrate levels, and substantially elevated lactate levels in the gut lumen. Administration of a lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor blunted lactate production in germ-free mice, suggesting that lactate was predominantly of host origin. Depletion of butyrate-producing Clostridia, either through oral antibiotic treatment or as part of the pathogen-induced dysbiosis, triggered a switch in host cells from oxidative metabolism to lactate fermentation, increasing both lactate levels and Salmonella lactate utilization. Administration of tributyrin or a PPARγ agonist diminished host lactate production and abrogated the fitness advantage conferred on Salmonella by lactate utilization. We conclude that alterations of the gut microbiota, specifically a depletion of Clostridia, reprogram host metabolism to perform lactate fermentation, thus supporting Salmonella infection.

Abstract: The development of a novel coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) expression cassette with an enhanced activity for gene therapy of hemophilia A (HA) is essential. The biological properties of several non-human FVIII sequences, such as porcine and canine, have been evaluated. Here, we compared the activity level of rat FVIII (rFVIII) and human FVIII (hFVIII) by using single-chain and dual-chain strategies in 293 T cells and the HA mice. In both in vitro and hydrodynamic injection studies, the activity of rFVIII detected by the activated partial thromboplastin time assay was higher than that of hFVIII both by single-chain (~2.96-fold and ~1.72-fold, respectively) and dual-chain (~7.69-fold and ~2.35-fold, respectively). Moreover, the dual chain exerted a potentially higher delivery efficacy compared with the single chain (~4.96-fold and ~2.99-fold, respectively). The blood loss of HA mice administrated with rFVIII was less than those with hFVIII. AAV-delivered rFVIII and hFVIII also exerted long-term therapeutic effects on HA mice and caused a transient ALT elevation. These data might help to the development of novel, optimized FVIII expression cassettes based on the amino acid difference between rFVIII and hFVIII. These data indicate that the dual-chain strategy would likely enhance the delivery efficiency of the AAV-mediated FVIII gene therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Properties of cancer stem cells involved in drug resistance and relapse have significant effects on clinical outcome. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically improved survival of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), TKIs have not fully cured CML due to TKI-resistant CML stem cells. Moreover, relapse after discontinuation of TKIs has not been predicted in CML patients with the best TKI response. In our study, a model of CML stem cells derived from CML induced pluripotent stem cells identified ADAM8 as an antigen of TKI-resistant CML cells. The inhibition of expression or metalloproteinase activity of ADAM8 restored TKI sensitivity in primary samples. In addition, residual CML cells in patients with optimal TKI response were concentrated in the ADAM8+ population. Our study demonstrates that ADAM8 is a marker of residual CML cells even in patients with optimal TKI response and would be a predictor of relapse and a therapeutic target of TKI-resistant CML cells.

Abstract: Background
To compare the Nordic and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) chemotherapy protocols for Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-Free Survival (PFS) for intracranial primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL).
Methods
A prospective database at Oslo University Hospital of PCNSL was reviewed over a 12-year period (2003–2014).
Results
Overall, 79 patients with PCNSL were identified, of whom 57 received chemotherapy. MSKCC with Rituximab (RTX) was used in 18 patients (32%) who had median OS of 46.3 months [9.8–131.9] and median PFS of 34.6 months [6.4–131.9]. The Nordic protocol was used in 14 patients (25%) who had median OS of 30.9 months [2.7–106.3] and PFS of 14.3 months [0.0–106.3]. The MSKCC was used without RTX in 25 patients (44%) who had OS of 15.2 months [0.7–136.5] and PFS of 12.0 months [0.0–117.0]. MSKCC with RTX had a significantly longer median OS (p < 0.05) compared to the other regimens in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, the only prognostic factor for OS and PFS of significance was deep brain involvement (p < 0.005).
Conclusions
In univariate analysis, the MSKCC with RTX achieved significantly longer median OS compared to the Nordic protocol. However, in multivariate analysis, the only prognostic factor for survival of statistical significance was deep brain involvement.

Abstract: Introduction
The extracellular matrix protein hyaluronan acid plays an active in role in tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Hyaluronan acid receptors, namely CD168 or the receptor for hyaluronan acid-mediated motility (RHAMM) and CD44 have been implicated in promoting malignancy. There is a lacuna in data on the expression of the receptor in pediatric leukemias.
Methods
Pediatric patients with acute leukemia who were diagnosed, treated and followed up in our center were enrolled. The bone marrow biopsies performed prior to treatment were subjected to immunohistochemical staining (54 biopsies: acute lymphoblastic leukemia – 45, acute myeloid leukemia – 9). Blast counts were carried out at diagnosis, end of the induction phase and end of chemotherapy, the minimal residual disease was assessed and follow up details were collected. Positivity was correlated with initial blast count, post-induction blast count, minimal residual disease and patient survival.
Results
There was no correlation between the initial blast count and the percentage of blasts with RHAMM expression. The positive correlation between percentage of blasts expressing RHAMM and the post-induction blast count was moderate in acute myeloid leukemia (0.74) and mild in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (0.48). There was a statistically significant difference in RHAMM expression between the two minimal residual disease risk groups (p-value=0.012) with a negative prognostic effect of RHAMM expression. Moreover, a negative prognostic effect of RHAMM expression was noted when patient survival was considered.
Conclusion
This study shows that blasts in acute myeloid leukemia show more RHAMM positivity than those of acute lymphoblastic leukemia indicating the aggressive nature of this type of leukemia. In acute leukemias, patients with high percentages of RHAMM-positive blasts had more post-induction blasts, blasts in minimal residual disease and poorer prognosis.

Abstract: Actin subunits assemble into actin filaments whose dynamics and three-dimensional architectures are further regulated by a variety of cellular factors to establish the functional actin cytoskeleton. The C-glucosidic ellagitannin vescalagin and its simpler analogue vescalin, affect both the dynamics and the ultrastructure of the actin cytoskeleton by directly binding to F-actin. Herein, we show that in vitro, the two compounds induce the formation of distinct F-actin networks characterized by different superstructures and dynamics. In living mature osteoclasts, highly specialized bone-degrading cells that constantly remodel their cytoskeleton, vescalagin and vescalin alter actin dynamics at podosomes and compromise the integrity of the podosome belt that forms the bone-degrading apparatus. Both compounds target the bone-resorbing activity at concentrations that preserve osteoclastic maturation and survival and with no detectable impact on the behaviour of bone-forming osteoblastic cells. This anti-osteoclastic activity of vescalagin and vescalin reveals the potential of targeting actin dynamics as a new therapeutic opportunity and, in this case, as a plausible approach for the local treatment of osteoporosis.

Abstract: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been determined to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms of BBB disruption in AD remain unclear. Our previous study suggested that the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) functioned as a signal transduction receptor in Aβ1–42-induced damage in endothelial cells. In our present study, we revealed that RAGE-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is essential for Aβ-induced endothelial cell damage. Here, we found that Aβ1–42 activated ERS by upregulation of Grp78, xbp-1 and CHOP in endothelial cells and that Aβ1–42-resulted lesions, including the upregulations of caspase-12 and caspase-3, the augment of bax/bcl-2 ratio, and the downregulations of ZO-1 and Occludin in bEnd.3 cells, were ameliorated by the pretreatment of salubrinal, an ERS inhibitor. Furthermore, the expressions of Grp78, xbp-1 and CHOP induced by Aβ1–42 were blocked by transfection of RAGE small interfering RNA (siRNA), which indicated that Aβ1–42 activated ERS in a RAGE-dependent manner. Additionally, bEnd.3 cells transfected with RAGE siRNA showed lower expressions of caspase-12 and caspase-3, decreased bax/bcl-2 ratio, and higher expressions of ZO-1 and Occludin following Aβ1-42 treatment, comparing to control cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that Aβ1–42 induced endothelial cells damage via activation of ERS in a RAGE-dependent manner.

Abstract: The X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a pivotal transcription factor in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Our previous studies have proven that XBP1 is involved in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and angiogenesis. In this study, we used EC monolayer wound healing, tube formation and transwell migration models to explore the role of XBP1splicing in EC migration. We found that scratching on EC monolayer triggered XBP1splicing, which was attenuated by the presence of SU5416and LY294002, suggesting that VEGF signalling pathways may be involved. Over-expression of the spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) via Ad-XBP1s gene transfer increased while knockdown of IRE1αor XBP1 by ShRNA lentivirus suppressed EC migration. Over-expression of XBP1s up-regulated the nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3)mRNA through the 3’UTR-mediated stabilisation and increased eNOS protein translation. Further experiments demonstrated that miR-24 participated in the XBP1s-induced eNOSup-regulation and EC migration. Further co-IP and immunofluorescence staining assays revealed that protein kinase B (Akt), eNOS andXBP1s form a complex, resulting in Akt and eNOS nucleus relocation. These results suggest that XBP1 splicing can regulate eNOS expression and cellular location, leading to EC migration and therefore contributing to wound healing and angiogenesis.

Abstract: Background
Although chronic lymphocytic leukemia is basically a B cell disease, its pathophysiology and evolution are thought to be significantly influenced by T cells, as these are probably the most important interaction partner of neoplastic B cells, participating in their expansion, differentiation and survival. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells may also drive functional and phenotypic changes of non-malignant T cells. There are few data about the association between memory T cells and prognosis, especially related to ZAP-70, a common reliable surrogate of the gold standard chronic lymphocytic leukemia prognostic markers.
Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate whether the expression of ZAP-70 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients is associated with abnormal patterns of the distribution of naïve and memory T cells related to crosstalk between these cells.
Methods
In this cross-sectional, controlled study, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were compared with healthy blood donors regarding the expression of ZAP-70 and the distribution of naïve and memory T cell subsets in peripheral blood as measured by flow cytometry.
Results
ZAP-70 positive patients presented an increased frequency and absolute number of central memory CD4+ T cells, but not CD8+ T cells, compared to ZAP-70 negative patients and age-matched apparently healthy donors.
Conclusions
Because central memory CD4+ T cells are located in lymph nodes and express CD40L, we consider that malignant ZAP-70-positive B cells may receive beneficial signals from central memory CD4+ T cells as they accumulate, which could contribute to more aggressive disease.

Abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most malignant tumors in China with a poor prognosis. Most ESCC patients were diagnosed at advanced stages, losing the opportunity for surgical excision. Hence, it remains a pressing work to identify biomarkers for early detection, prognosis prediction and targeting therapies in ESCC. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) encodes a 15-kDa protein, and is involved in the post-translational modification (PTMs) of multiple proteins. However, the molecular functions of ISG15 in ESCC remain unclear. In this work, we found that ISG15 was aberrantly expressed in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Enhanced protein level of ISG15 promoted cellular malignant phenotypes including proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation in vivo. Consistently, reduction of ISG15 attenuated the cellular malignant phenotype in ESCC cell lines. Furthermore, gene-expression profiles suggested that the differentially expressed ISG15 affected the expression of a panel of genes enriched in the cell adherens junction, such as c-MET. Notably, as a secreted protein, the concentration of ISG15 was elevated in ESCC plasma than healthy individuals, acting as a potential diagnostic marker. Taken together, our results suggested a tumor promotion role of ISG15 in ESCC via c-MET/Fyn/β-catenin pathway.

Abstract: The human DEAD-box helicase DDX3 is a multi-functional protein involved in the regulation of gene expression and additional non-conventional roles as signalling adaptor molecule that are independent of its enzymatic RNA remodeling activity. It is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein and it has previously been suggested that dysregulation of its subcellular localization could contribute to tumourigenesis. Indeed, both tumour suppressor and oncogenic functions have been attributed to DDX3. In this study, we investigated the regulation of DDX3’s nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. We confirmed that an N-terminal conserved Nuclear Export Signal (NES) is required for export of human DDX3 from the nucleus, and identified three regions within DDX3 that can independently facilitate its nuclear import. We also aimed to identify conditions that alter DDX3’s subcellular localisation. Viral infection, cytokine treatment and DNA damage only induced minor changes in DDX3’s subcellular distribution as determined by High Content Analysis. However, DDX3’s nuclear localization increased in early mitotic cells (during prophase) concomitant with an increase in DDX3 expression levels. Our results are likely to have implications for the proposed use of (nuclear) DDX3 as a prognostic biomarker in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are well known for their role in maintaining naive pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that, jointly, TET1 and TET2 also safeguard the self-renewal potential of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) and have partially redundant roles in maintaining the epithelial integrity of TSCs. For the more abundantly expressed TET1, we show that this is achieved by binding to critical epithelial genes, notably E-cadherin, which becomes hyper-methylated and downregulated in the absence of TET1. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype of mutant TSCs is accompanied by centrosome duplication and separation defects. Moreover, we identify a role of TET1 in maintaining cyclin B1 stability, thereby acting as facilitator of mitotic cell-cycle progression. As a result, Tet1/2 mutant TSCs are prone to undergo endoreduplicative cell cycles leading to the formation of polyploid trophoblast giant cells. Taken together, our data reveal essential functions of TET proteins in the trophoblast lineage.

Abstract: RalGPS2 is a Ras-independent Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) for RalA containing a PH domain and an SH3-binding region and it is involved in several cellular processes, such as cytokinesis, control of cell cycle progression, differentiation, cytoskeleton organization and rearrangement. Up to now, few data have been published regarding RalGPS2 role in cancer cells, and its involvement in bladder cancer is yet to be established. In this paper we demonstrated that RalGPS2 is expressed in urothelial carcinoma-derived 5637 cancer cells and is essential for cellular growth. These cells produces thin membrane protrusions that displayed the characteristics of actin rich tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) and here we show that RalGPS2 is involved in the formation of these cellular protrusions. In fact the overexpression of RalGPS2 or of its PH-domain increased markedly the number and the length of nanotubes, while the knock-down of RalGPS2 caused a strong reduction of these structures. Moreover, using a series of RalA mutants impaired in the interaction with different downstream components (Sec5, Exo84, RalBP1) we demonstrated that the interaction of RalA with Sec5 is required for TNTs formation. Furthermore, we found that RalGPS2 interacts with the transmembrane MHC class III protein leukocyte specific transcript 1 (LST1) and RalA, leading to the formation of a complex which promotes TNTs generation. These findings allow us to add novel elements to molecular models that have been previously proposed regarding TNTs formation.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, fatal and progressive fibro-proliferative lung disease, and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation is a crucial process in the development of IPF. Elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K) has been reported to play an important role in various disease types, but the role of eEF2K in IPF is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of eEF2K in normal lung fibroblast (NHLF) proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and autophagy as well as the interaction between eEF2K and p38 MAPK signaling through in vitro experiments. We found that the inhibition of eEF2K markedly augmented cell proliferation and differentiation, suppressed apoptosis and autophagy, and reversed the anti-fibrotic effects of a p38 MAPK inhibitor. Together, our results indicate that eEF2K might inhibit TGF-β1-induced NHLF proliferation and differentiation and activate NHLF cell apoptosis and autophagy through p38 MAPK signaling, which might ameliorate lung fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy donor to patient is a treatment for microbiome-associated diseases. Although the success of FMT requires donor bacteria to engraft in the patient's gut, the forces governing engraftment in humans are unknown. Here we use an ongoing clinical experiment, the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, to uncover the rules of engraftment in humans. We built a statistical model that predicts which bacterial species will engraft in a given host, and developed Strain Finder, a method to infer strain genotypes and track them over time. We find that engraftment can be predicted largely from the abundance and phylogeny of bacteria in the donor and the pre-FMT patient. Furthermore, donor strains within a species engraft in an all-or-nothing manner and previously undetected strains frequently colonize patients receiving FMT. We validated these findings for metabolic syndrome, suggesting that the same principles of engraftment extend to other indications.

Abstract: Introduction
Congenital factor V deficiency (FVD) is a rare bleeding disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1000,000 in the general population. Since the common coagulation tests do not correlate with the bleeding tendency there is an unmet need to predict FVD patients' bleeding hazard prior to surgical interventions.
Aim
To optimize treatment prior to surgical interventions, using global coagulation assays, thrombin generation (TG) and rotating thromboelastogram (ROTEM).
Methods
Our cohort included 5 patients with FVD, 4 severe and one mild. Two of them underwent TG and ROTEM prior to surgical interventions, including ex vivo spiking assays using bypass agents and platelets spiking.
Results
All five patients exhibited prolonged PT and PTT, non-dependent on their bleeding tendency. Patient 1, who demonstrated severe bleeding phenotype, underwent surgery treated by combination of APCC (FEIBA) and platelet transfusion. Therapy was guided by global tests (TG as well as ROTEM) results. During the pre and post-operative period neither excessive bleeding nor any thrombosis was noted. In contrast, TG and ROTEM analysis of patient 4 has lead us to perform the surgery without any blood products' support. Indeed, the patient did not encounter any bleeding.
Conclusion
Global coagulation assays may be useful ancillary tools guiding treatment decisions in FVD patients undergoing surgical procedures.

Abstract: Introduction
Mutations in the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia 1 gene are the leading cause of resistance to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Mutations have been detected throughout the extension of the kinase domain of this gene and it is important to investigate their positions because there may be a difference in clinical relevance.
Objective
To evaluate mutations in the transcripts of the BCR-ABL1 gene in Brazilian patients with chronic myeloid leukemia under tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in the Hospital de Clínicas of the Universidade Federal do Paraná.
Methods
This retrospective observational cross-sectional study analyzed mutation data of BCR-ABL1 gene transcripts. Three hundred and thirty peripheral blood samples from 193 patients were evaluated with the search for mutations being achieved by Sanger sequencing.
Results
Sixteen mutation types were identified in 48/193 (24.87%) patients with T315I (20.83%) being the most common. Furthermore, four polymorphisms (T240T, K247R, E275E and Y275Y) were identified. The highest incidence of mutations (19/53: 35.85%) occurred in the P-loop of the tyrosine kinase domain, whereas no mutation was found in the A-loop. In 43/48 (89.58%) patients only one mutation was found and more than one mutation was found in 5/48 (10.42%). The simultaneous presence of two mutations (E189G/V299L and E255K/T315I) was observed in 2/5 patients while the different mutations were seen in sequential samples of the other three patients (Y253Y/T315I, T315I/E255K and E255K/T315I).
Conclusions
This molecular characterization contributed to the identification of the resistance profile to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Brazilian patients, thus enabling the use of adequate therapeutic strategies in a timely manner.

Abstract: Background
Human aplastic anemia is a hematologic disease characterized by low peripheral blood cell counts associated with reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and a hypocellular bone marrow. Thrombopoietin (THPO) regulates megakaryocytes, but it also stimulates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Biallelic mutations in the THPO gene have been reported in a family with recessive inherited aplastic anemia.
Methods
This study screened 83 patients diagnosed with acquired aplastic anemia and 92 paired healthy controls for germline variants in the THPO gene using Sanger sequencing.
Results
Three common single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in patients and controls at comparable allele frequencies. There was no correlation between the single nucleotide polymorphism carrier status and platelet counts at diagnosis.
Conclusion
The presence of THPO polymorphisms is comparable between patients with acquired aplastic anemia and healthy individuals.

Abstract: MicroRNA-30e-5p (miR-30e-5p) is a tumor suppressor that is known to be downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, how miR-30e-5p inhibits NSCLC tumorigenesis is not known. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) is upregulated in NSCLC and promotes tumorigenesis via a Sirt1-JAK-STAT3 pathway. In this study, we investigated whether miR-30e-5p inhibits tumor growth by targeting USP22 in NSCLC. Our results reveal that miR-30e-5p expression was correlated negatively with USP22 in NSCLC tissues. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-30e-5p negatively regulated USP22 expression by binding to a specific sequence in the 3ʹUTR. MiR-30e-5p overexpression and USP22 knockdown significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NSCLC cells in vitro. The effects of miR-30e-5p inhibition were prevented by USP22 knockdown. MiR-30e-5p inhibited SIRT1 expression and increased expression of p53 and the phosphorylated form of STAT3 (pSTAT3). Furthermore, miR-30e-5p prevented USP22-mediated regulation of SIRT1, pSTAT3, and p53 expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-30e-5p suppresses NSCLC tumorigenesis by downregulatingUSP22-mediated Sirt1/JAK/STAT3 signaling. Our study has identified miR-30e-5p as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLC.

Abstract: A bone-remodeling imbalance induced by increased bone resorption and osteoclast formation causes skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis. Induction of osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) leads to bone regeneration. Many researchers have tried to develop new adjuvants as specific stimulators of bone regeneration for therapeutic use in patients with bone resorption. We tried to develop a new adjuvant that has stronger osteogenic differentiation-promoting activity than bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). In this study, we identified a new peptide, which we called bone-forming peptide (BFP)-3, derived from the immature precursor of BMP-7. Upon osteogenic differentiation, BMSCs treated with BFP-3 exhibited higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization ability and significantly up-regulated expression of osteogenic genes such as ALP, osteocalcin (OC), Osterix, and Runx2 compared with control BMSCs. Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that BFP-3 treatment up-regulated CD44 expression. Interestingly, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation was increased by BFP-3 treatment during osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, BFP-3-induced osteogenic differentiation was significantly decreased by treatment with ERK1/2- and Smad-specific inhibitors. These results suggest that BFP-3 plays an important role in regulating osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through increasing levels of osteogenic-inducing factors and regulating the ERK1/2 and Smad1/5/8 signaling pathways. Our finding indicates that BFP-3 may be a potential new therapeutic target for promoting bone formation.

Abstract: Autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system are the two major cellular processes for protein and organelle recycling and clearance in eukaryotic cells. Evidence is accumulating that these two pathways are interrelated through adaptor proteins. Here, we found that PSMD1 and PSMD2, both components of the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome, directly interact with Dictyostelium discoideum autophagy 16 (ATG16), a core autophagosomal protein. ATG16 is composed of an N-terminal domain, which is responsible for homo-dimerization and binding to ATG5 and a C-terminal β-propeller structure. Deletion analysis of ATG16 showed that the N-terminal half of ATG16 interacted directly only with PSMD1, while the C-terminal half interacted with both, PSMD1 and PSMD2. RFP-tagged PSMD1 as well as PSMD2 were enriched in large puncta, reminiscent of autophagosomes, in wild-type cells. These puncta were absent in atg16‾ and atg9‾/16‾ cells and weaker and less frequent in atg9‾ cells, showing that ATG16 was crucial and the autophagic process important for their formation. Co-expression of ATG16-GFP or GFP-ATG8a(LC3) with RFP-PSMD1 or RFP-PSMD2, respectively, in atg16‾ or wild-type cells revealed many instances of co-localization, suggesting that RFP-PSMD1 or RFP-PSMD2 positive puncta constitute autophagosomes. LysoTracker® labeling and a proteolytic cleavage assay confirmed that PSMD1 and PSMD2 were present in lysosomes in wild-type cells. In vivo, ATG16 is required for their enrichment in ATG8a positive puncta, which mature into autolysosomes. We propose that ATG16 links autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system.

Abstract: Background
To present the results of the application of the Blood Donation Knowledge Questionnaire in a large and representative sample of users of primary care services in order to extend the evaluation of the metrics of the items and to assess knowledge about blood donation in association with sociodemographic variables.
Method
The Blood Donation Knowledge Questionnaire is composed of 24 items based on blood donation requirements of the Brazilian Ministry of Health and on some popular beliefs and concepts of the Brazilian population regarding the blood donation process. Data collection was carried out in 12 healthcare facilities of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo. The analysis of items was performed using classical test theory with associations being assessed using the multivariate Tobit regression model.
Results
A total of 1055 individuals participated (79.7% females and a mean age of 40.6 years). Previous blood donation was reported by 246 (23.3%) participants, 669 (63.4%) had never donated, and 140 (13.3%) reported being ineligible to donate blood. This questionnaire is comprised of items considered easy-to-understand, with a facility level of medium to high and generally an adequate capability of discrimination. Higher means of correct answers were detected among females, individuals with more schooling, and subjects who had already donated blood.
Conclusion
The Blood Donation Knowledge Questionnaire is an instrument that aims to measure some general aspects of knowledge regarding blood donation and can be used in different contexts. There is evidence that knowledge of primary healthcare users regarding blood donation is correlated to sex, educational level, and previous blood donation.

Abstract: Emerging evidence indicates that lncRNAs play crucial roles in the initiation and progression of various malignant tumors. VIM-AS1 RNA is an lncRNA that transcribes from a shared bidirectional promoter with vimentin mRNA and its function in cancer cells is largely unknown. This study assessed the clinical significance of VIM-AS1 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC). We found that the VIM-AS1 transcript was significantly upregulated in high-grade, lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion tumors. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that the downregulation of VIM-AS1 could inhibit tumor cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis, cellular senescence and arresting the cell cycle. Moreover, the obtained data demonstrated that VIM-AS1 might play a crucial role in cell migration as well as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells. Collectively, for the first time, our data provide novel evidence for the biological and clinical significance of VIM-AS1 expression in CRC. Further, the findings of this study suggest that VIM-AS1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis by inducing EMT in CRC cells and could be considered as a novel tumor marker with probable value in diagnosis and CRC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin is now widespread and new therapeutics are urgently required. We report the first in toto chemical synthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of octapeptins, a class of lipopeptides structurally related to colistin. The octapeptin biosynthetic cluster consisted of three non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (OctA, OctB, and OctC) that produced an amphiphilic antibiotic, octapeptin C4, which was shown to bind to and depolarize membranes. While active against multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains in vitro, octapeptin C4 displayed poor in vivo efficacy, most likely due to high plasma protein binding. Nuclear magnetic resonance solution structures, empirical structure-activity and structure-toxicity models were used to design synthetic octapeptins active against MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria. The scaffold was then subtly altered to reduce plasma protein binding, while maintaining activity against MDR and XDR bacteria. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in a murine bacteremia model with a colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolate.

Abstract: The unchecked tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL1 contributes to the immortality of leukaemic cells. Therefore, this oncogene is a highly important therapeutic target for chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are an excellent drug treatment for CML patients. However, there are still some patients who are not responsive to TKIs. We found that a novel circular RNA (circRNA), named circBA9.3, is derived from BCR-ABL1. CircBA9.3 can efficiently promote the proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of cancer cells. In addition, some patients with TKI resistance have elevated circBA9.3 expression, which is positively correlated with the level of BCR-ABL1. Furthermore, circBA9.3 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and enhances c-ABL1 and BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein expression. Thus, circBA9.3 is a molecule associated with increased tyrosine kinase activity that promotes resistance against TKI therapy. In this study, we provided a new potential target for the treatment of TKI-resistant CML patients.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and differentiation in the developing brain is a complex process precisely regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Although epigenetic modification has been reportedly involved in the regulation of the cerebral cortex, whether UTX, an H3K27me3 demethylase, regulates the development of cerebral cortex during the embryonic period is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that Utx deficiency by knockdown and conditional knockout increases NSC proliferation and decreases terminal mitosis and neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we find that impairment of cortical development caused by lack of Utx is less significant in males than in females. In addition, UTX demethylates H3K27me3 at the Pten promoter and promotes Pten expression. P-AKT and P-mTOR levels are increased in the Utx conditional knockout cortices. Finally, Utx or Pten overexpression can rescue the impairment of brain development caused by Utx loss. These findings may provide important clues toward deciphering brain diseases.

Abstract: Regulation of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and of vascular permeability plays a critical role in the maintenance of functional pulmonary microvascular barriers. Little is yet known about the effect of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor fasudil on leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions or the underlying mechanism. In the present study, as evaluated using co-culture systems of neutrophils and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), fasudil dose-dependently suppressed neutrophil chemotaxis by decreasing the production of chemotactic factors in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated HPMECs. The inhibitory role of fasudil in neutrophil chemotaxis was mediated by down-regulation of the chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), since the inhibition was abolished by 4-phenyl butyric acid (a chemical chaperone mimicking GRP78). In addition, fasudil inhibited LPS-induced neutrophil-endothelial adhesion by reducing the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. By use of lentiviral transfection in HPMECs, bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) overexpression suppressed the LPS-induced increase of both ICAM-1 expression and neutrophil-endothelial adhesion, whereas knocking down BMPR2 abolished the inhibitory role of fasudil in both ICAM-1 expression and neutrophil-endothelial adhesion. Moreover, fasudil alleviated LPS-induced hyperpermeability of HPMEC monolayers by leading to the recovery of intercellular junctions, thereafter reduced neutrophil transendothelial cell migration. Therefore, fasudil inhibited leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and vascular hyperpermeability through modulation of GRP78 and BMPR2 expression, suggesting a potential role for ROCK as a switch for inhibiting leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions.

Abstract: Ca2+ signaling is essential for bone metabolism. Fluid shear stress (FSS), which can induce a rapid release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to produce calcium transients, plays a significant role in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. However, it is still unclear of how calcium transients induced by FSS activating a number of downstream signals which subsequently regulate cell functions. In this study, we performed a group of Ca2+ transients models, which were induced by FSS to investigate the effects of different magnitudes of Ca2+ transients in osteoblast proliferation. Further, we performed a global proteomic profile of MC3T3-E1 cells in different Ca2+ transients models stimulated by FSS. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the TCA cycle was activated in the proliferating process. The activation of TCA needed mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake which were influenced by the amplitude of Ca2+ transients induced by FSS. Our work elucidate that osteoblast proliferation induced by FSS was related to the magnitude of calcium transients, which further activated energetic metabolism signaling pathway. This work revealed further understanding the mechanism of osteoblast proliferation induced by mechanic loading and help us to design new methods for osteoporosis therapy.

Abstract: Background
Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is a disorder of platelet function. Standard therapy includes platelet transfusions, which may be hampered by antiplatelet antibodies.
Aims
To assess potential correlation between bleeding and number of active platelets in GT patients undergoing surgery. Clinical peri- operative patients' hemostasis was compared with flow cytometry analysis (FC), and whole blood clot formation.
Methods
GT patients undergoing surgery were included. Blood counts, platelet activation studies, FC and rotational thromboelastography (ROTEM) were performed as ancillary tests to estimate the effectiveness of treatment.
Results
A total of 4 GT patients undergoing 5 surgeries were included. Consecutive FC analysis following platelet transfusions showed gradual decrease of donor platelets with a nadir of 3280 platelets in patients who experienced no post procedural bleeding following minor procedures. After major surgery, bleeding occurred when donor platelets decreased to 2600–4280. Decline in donor platelets was associated with reduced clot firmness as noted by ROTEM.
Conclusion
Results suggest that very low number of active donor platelets may suffice to achieve proper hemostasis in certain procedures. Our study points to the potential role of consecutive FC examinations to demonstrate the number of donor platelets as an ancillary tool for decision making in GT patients undergoing surgery.

Abstract: Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a rare disorder in Indians and is not associated with the common mutation Cys282Tyr in HFE gene found in Caucasians. Non-HFE HH can be associated with mutations in HJV, HAMP, TFR2 and SLC40A1 genes. Nineteen unrelated north Indian HH patients were detected after screening 258 chronic liver disease patients on the basis of increased transferrin saturation, ferritin levels >1000 ng/L and siderosis by Perl's stain on liver biopsy wherever available. Automated DNA sequencing was performed for the promoters and entire coding exons for HFE, HJV, HAMP, TFR2 and SLC40A1. A novel homozygous mutation at position p.Gly336Ter (c.1006 G>T) in exon 4 in HJV was identified in four adult unrelated patients. We encountered compound heterozygosity for p.Thr217Ile (c.650C>T) and p.His63Asp (c.187C>G) mutation of HFE gene in one patient. Two patients were compound heterozygous for two novel polymorphisms at c.−358 (G>A) and c.−36 (G>A) in 5′UTR of HJV gene. Our study shows a novel HJV gene mutation p.Gly336Ter as a recurrent mutation associated with HH in north Indians. Low index of suspicion, underlying nutritional iron deficiency and protective effect of menstrual blood loss may account for the late clinical presentation of juvenile HH.

Abstract: Variation in platelet response to thrombin may affect the safety and efficacy of PAR antagonism. The Thr120 variant of the common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs773902 in the protease-activated receptor (PAR) 4 gene is associated with higher platelet aggregation compared to the Ala120 variant. We investigated the relationship between the rs773902 SNP with major bleeding and ischemic events, safety, and efficacy of PAR1 inhibition in 6177 NSTE ACS patients in the TRACER trial. There was a lower rate of GUSTO moderate/severe bleeding in patients with the Thr120 variant. The difference was driven by a lower rate in the smaller homozygous group (recessive model, HR 0.13 [0.02–0.92] P = 0.042). No significant differences were observed in the ischemic outcomes. The excess in bleeding observed with PAR1 inhibition was attenuated in patients with the Thr120 variant, but the interactions were not statistically significant. In summary, lower major bleeding rates were observed in the overall TRACER cohort with the hyperreactive PAR4 Thr120 variant. The increase in bleeding with vorapaxar was attenuated with the Thr120 variant, but we could not demonstrate an interaction with PAR1 inhibition. These findings warrant further exploration, including those of African ancestry where the A allele (Thr120) frequency is ~65%.
