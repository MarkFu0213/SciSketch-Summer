Abstract: Summary
The MDM2 oncoprotein antagonizes the tumor suppressor p53 by physical interaction and ubiquitination. However, it also sustains the progression of DNA replication forks, even in the absence of functional p53. Here, we show that MDM2 binds, inhibits, ubiquitinates, and destabilizes poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). When cellular MDM2 levels are increased, this leads to accelerated progression of DNA replication forks, much like pharmacological inhibition of PARP1. Conversely, overexpressed PARP1 restores normal fork progression despite elevated MDM2. Strikingly, MDM2 profoundly reduces the frequency of fork reversal, revealed as four-way junctions through electron microscopy. Depletion of RECQ1 or the primase/polymerase (PRIMPOL) reverses the MDM2-mediated acceleration of the nascent DNA elongation rate. MDM2 also increases the occurrence of micronuclei, and it exacerbates camptothecin-induced cell death. In conclusion, high MDM2 levels phenocopy PARP inhibition in modulation of fork restart, representing a potential vulnerability of cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Protocadherin-19 (PCDH19) is a synaptic cell-adhesion molecule encoded by X-linked PCDH19, a gene linked with epilepsy. Here, we report a synapse-to-nucleus signaling pathway through which PCDH19 bridges neuronal activity with gene expression. In particular, we describe the NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent proteolytic cleavage of PCDH19, which leads to the generation of a PCDH19 C-terminal fragment (CTF) able to enter the nucleus. We demonstrate that PCDH19 CTF associates with chromatin and with the chromatin remodeler lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and regulates expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs). Our results are consistent with a model whereby PCDH19 favors maintenance of neuronal homeostasis via negative feedback regulation of IEG expression and provide a key to interpreting PCDH19-related hyperexcitability.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy among women in developed countries and the main cause of death related to cancer in women worldwide. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are vesicles with a variable size enclosed within a phospholipid bilayer that contain a variety of molecules with biological activity. Cancer cells release EVs that induce proliferation, escape from apoptosis, reprogramming energy metabolism, invasion and metastasis. In this study we studied whether EV fractions deprived of platelet EVs from breast cancer women (BC EVs) can mediate cell processes related with angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our findings demonstrate that BC EVs enhance migration, invasion and formation of new tubules in HUVECs, compared with EV fractions deprived of platelet EVs from healthy women (Ctrl EVs). In summary, we demonstrate, for the first time, that BC EVs induce cellular processes in HUVECs that participate in angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Lassa virus (LASV) is the etiologic agent of Lassa Fever, a hemorrhagic disease that is endemic to West Africa. During LASV infection, LASV glycoprotein (GP) engages with multiple host receptors for cell entry. Neutralizing antibodies against GP are rare and principally target quaternary epitopes displayed only on the metastable, pre-fusion conformation of GP. Currently, the structural features of the neutralizing GPC-A antibody competition group are understudied. Structures of two GPC-A antibodies presented here demonstrate that they bind the side of the pre-fusion GP trimer, bridging the GP1 and GP2 subunits. Complementary biochemical analyses indicate that antibody 25.10C, which is broadly specific, neutralizes by inhibiting binding of the endosomal receptor LAMP1 and also by blocking membrane fusion. The other GPC-A antibody, 36.1F, which is lineage-specific, prevents LAMP1 association only. These data illuminate a site of vulnerability on LASV GP and will guide efforts to elicit broadly reactive therapeutics and vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Many cancers are characterized by gene fusions encoding oncogenic chimeric transcription factors (TFs) such as EWS::FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma (EwS). Here, we find that EWS::FLI1 induces the robust expression of a specific set of novel spliced and polyadenylated transcripts within otherwise transcriptionally silent regions of the genome. These neogenes (NGs) are virtually undetectable in large collections of normal tissues or non-EwS tumors and can be silenced by CRISPR interference at regulatory EWS::FLI1-bound microsatellites. Ribosome profiling and proteomics further show that some NGs are translated into highly EwS-specific peptides. More generally, we show that hundreds of NGs can be detected in diverse cancers characterized by chimeric TFs. Altogether, this study identifies the transcription, processing, and translation of novel, specific, highly expressed multi-exonic transcripts from otherwise silent regions of the genome as a new activity of aberrant TFs in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler Mi-2/CHD4 broadly modulates chromatin landscapes to repress transcription and to maintain genome integrity. Here we use individual nucleotide resolution crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) to show that Drosophila Mi-2 associates with thousands of mRNA molecules in vivo. Biochemical data reveal that recombinant dMi-2 preferentially binds to G-rich RNA molecules using two intrinsically disordered regions of unclear function. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription and RNase digestion approaches establish that RNA inhibits the association of dMi-2 with chromatin. We also show that RNA inhibits dMi-2-mediated nucleosome mobilization by competing with the nucleosome substrate. Importantly, this activity is shared by CHD4, the human homolog of dMi-2, strongly suggesting that RNA-mediated regulation of remodeler activity is an evolutionary conserved mechanism. Our data support a model in which RNA serves to protect actively transcribed regions of the genome from dMi-2/CHD4-mediated establishment of repressive chromatin structures.

Abstract: Summary
Motor cortex generates descending output necessary for executing a wide range of limb movements. Although movement-related activity has been described throughout motor cortex, the spatiotemporal organization of movement-specific signaling in deep layers remains largely unknown. Here we record layer 5B population dynamics in the caudal forelimb area of motor cortex while mice perform a forelimb push/pull task and find that most neurons show movement-invariant responses, with a minority displaying movement specificity. Using cell-type-specific imaging, we identify that invariant responses dominate pyramidal tract (PT) neuron activity, with a small subpopulation representing movement type, whereas a larger proportion of intratelencephalic (IT) neurons display movement-type-specific signaling. The proportion of IT neurons decoding movement-type peaks prior to movement initiation, whereas for PT neurons, this occurs during movement execution. Our data suggest that layer 5B population dynamics largely reflect movement-invariant signaling, with information related to movement-type being routed through relatively small, distributed subpopulations of projection neurons.

Abstract: The human amniotic membrane (HAM) is widely used as a natural scaffold in tissue engineering due to its excellent biological characteristics, including anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, low immunogenicity, and pro-angiogenic properties. This study aimed to develop simple and cost-effective protocols for the decellularization of HAM (d-HAM) using detergent-free methods, i.e., mechanical force (brushing) and physical treatment (heating 45–55 °C). The effectiveness of the methods of interest was compared with a chemical-based approach (EDTA + NaOH + NH4Cl). The prepared d-HAMs were characterized using a series of physico-chemical, mechanical, and biological evaluations. The results from DAPI staining revealed that the chemical method could completely remove epithelial cells from HAM, while the two other approaches only reduced the number of epithelial cells. All three decellularization methods led to a sharp reduction (P < 0.001) in the DNA content of the tissue samples (< 50 ng/mg). Histological evaluations showed the preservation of the d-HAMs’ integrity along with the conservation of collagen and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Although the chemical method caused the lowest mechanical deterioration (3.55 MPa in ultimate tensile stress), the mechanical method preserved the highest hydroxyproline levels (3.13 mg/mL). On the other hand, the physical method (heating to 45 and 50 °C) encouraged cell proliferation more than the chemical and mechanical approaches. All of the samples proved to be suitable for cell attachment and could induce cell migration. In conclusion, the present study showed that the use of detergent-free protocols is applicable for the decellularization of HAM, and the obtained tissues may be considered as inexpensive dressings for numerous tissue engineering applications.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) regulate tissue homeostasis, protect against pathogens at mucosal surfaces, and are key players at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity. How ILCs adapt their phenotype and function to environmental cues within tissues remains to be fully understood. Here, we show that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection alters the phenotype and function of lung IL-18Rα+ ILC toward a protective interferon-γ-producing ILC1-like population. This differentiation is controlled by type 1 cytokines and is associated with a glycolytic program. Moreover, a BCG-driven type I milieu enhances the early generation of ILC1-like cells during secondary challenge with Mtb. Collectively, our data reveal how tissue-resident ILCs adapt to type 1 inflammation toward a pathogen-tailored immune response.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is a global health concern, yearly resulting in 10 million new cases of active TB. Immunologic investigation of lung granulomas is essential for understanding host control of bacterial replication. Here, we identify and compare the pathological, cellular, and functional differences in granulomas at 4, 12, and 20 weeks post-infection in Chinese cynomolgus macaques. Original granulomas differ in transcription-factor expression within adaptive lymphocytes, with those at 12 weeks showing higher frequencies of CD8+T-bet+ T cells, while CD4+T-bet+ T cells increase at 20 weeks post-infection. The appearance of T-bet+ adaptive T cells at 12 and 20 weeks is coincident with a reduction in bacterial burden, suggesting their critical role in Mtb control. This study highlights the evolution of T cell responses within lung granulomas, suggesting that vaccines promoting the development and migration of T-bet+ T cells would enhance mycobacterial control.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastomas are malignant tumors of the central nervous system hallmarked by subclonal diversity and dynamic adaptation amid developmental hierarchies. The source of dynamic reorganization within the spatial context of these tumors remains elusive. Here, we characterized glioblastomas by spatially resolved transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics. By deciphering regionally shared transcriptional programs across patients, we infer that glioblastoma is organized by spatial segregation of lineage states and adapts to inflammatory and/or metabolic stimuli, reminiscent of the reactive transformation in mature astrocytes. Integration of metabolic imaging and imaging mass cytometry uncovered locoregional tumor-host interdependence, resulting in spatially exclusive adaptive transcriptional programs. Inferring copy-number alterations emphasizes a spatially cohesive organization of subclones associated with reactive transcriptional programs, confirming that environmental stress gives rise to selection pressure. A model of glioblastoma stem cells implanted into human and rodent neocortical tissue mimicking various environments confirmed that transcriptional states originate from dynamic adaptation to various environments.

Abstract: Summary
Using pre-treatment gene expression, protein/phosphoprotein, and clinical data from the I-SPY2 neoadjuvant platform trial (NCT01042379), we create alternative breast cancer subtypes incorporating tumor biology beyond clinical hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status to better predict drug responses. We assess the predictive performance of mechanism-of-action biomarkers from ∼990 patients treated with 10 regimens targeting diverse biology. We explore >11 subtyping schemas and identify treatment-subtype pairs maximizing the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate over the population. The best performing schemas incorporate Immune, DNA repair, and HER2/Luminal phenotypes. Subsequent treatment allocation increases the overall pCR rate to 63% from 51% using HR/HER2-based treatment selection. pCR gains from reclassification and improved patient selection are highest in HR+ subsets (>15%). As new treatments are introduced, the subtyping schema determines the minimum response needed to show efficacy. This data platform provides an unprecedented resource and supports the usage of response-based subtypes to guide future treatment prioritization.

Abstract: Summary
Antigen presentation by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) on the cell surface is critical for the transduction of the immune signal toward cytotoxic T lymphocytes. DNA damage upregulates HLA class I presentation; however, the mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that DNA-damage-induced HLA (di-HLA) presentation requires an immunoproteasome, PSMB8/9/10, and antigen-transporter, TAP1/2, demonstrating that antigen production is essential. Furthermore, we show that di-HLA presentation requires ATR, AKT, mTORC1, and p70-S6K signaling. Notably, the depletion of CBP20, a factor initiating the pioneer round of translation (PRT) that precedes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), abolishes di-HLA presentation, suggesting that di-antigen production requires PRT. RNA-seq analysis demonstrates that DNA damage reduces NMD transcripts in an ATR-dependent manner, consistent with the requirement for ATR in the initiation of PRT/NMD. Finally, bioinformatics analysis identifies that PRT-derived 9-mer peptides bind to HLA and are potentially immunogenic. Therefore, DNA damage signaling produces immunogenic antigens by utilizing the machinery of PRT/NMD.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to shutoff of protein synthesis, and nsp1, a central shutoff factor in coronaviruses, inhibits cellular mRNA translation. However, the diverse molecular mechanisms employed by nsp1 as well as its functional importance are unresolved. By overexpressing various nsp1 mutants and generating a SARS-CoV-2 mutant, we show that nsp1, through inhibition of translation and induction of mRNA degradation, targets translated cellular mRNA and is the main driver of host shutoff during infection. The propagation of nsp1 mutant virus is inhibited exclusively in cells with intact interferon (IFN) pathway as well as in vivo, in hamsters, and this attenuation is associated with stronger induction of type I IFN response. Therefore, although nsp1’s shutoff activity is broad, it plays an essential role, specifically in counteracting the IFN response. Overall, our results reveal the multifaceted approach nsp1 uses to shut off cellular protein synthesis and uncover nsp1’s explicit role in blocking the IFN response.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical layer 5 contains two major types of projection neuron known as IB (intrinsic bursting) cells that project sub-cortically and RS (regular spiking) cells that project between cortical areas. This study describes the plasticity properties of RS and IB cells in the mouse visual cortex during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. We find that RS neurons exhibit synaptic depression in response to both dark exposure (DE) and monocular deprivation (MD), and their homeostatic recovery from depression is dependent on TNF-α. In contrast, IB cells demonstrate opposite responses to DE and MD, potentiating to DE and depressing to MD. IB cells’ potentiation depends on CaMKII-autophosphorylation and not TNF-α. IB cells show mature synaptic properties at the start of the critical period while RS cells mature during the critical period. Together with observations in somatosensory cortex, these results suggest that differences in RS and IB plasticity mechanisms are a general cortical property.

Abstract: Purpose
Given that Vitamin D (VD) has been confirmed to reinforce the toxic effects of 5-aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) towards breast cancer, this study was designed to decipher the combined effects of VD, ALA-PDT and paclitaxel (PTX).
Methods
Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay was conducted to gauge the viability of breast cancer cells treated with ALA-PDT and PTX alone or in combination. The cell migration, invasion and apoptosis were measured by wound healing, transwell and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Xenograft tumor models were established and tumor volume and weight were recorded. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in cells and tumor tissues was determined by western blot assay.
Results
Both ALA-PDT and PTX alone inhibited viability in a dose-dependent manner, blocked migration and invasion, boosted apoptosis, down-regulated Bcl-2 expression and upregulated the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in breast cancer cells. More significant effects on the above-mentioned factors were induced by ALA-PDT and PTX in combination. Moreover, ALA-PDT and PTX in combination also suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors and Bcl-2 expression while promoting the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in tumors. In contrast, VD had no effect on tumor growth and the expression of Bcl-2, Bax and cleavedcaspase-3, but intensified the combined effects of ALA-PDT and PTX.
Conclusion
VD could enhance the therapeutic effects of ALA-PDT combined with PTX on tumor growth and cell apoptosis.

Abstract: Mechanical strain can act as a global cue to orient the core planar cell polarity pathway (Fz-PCP) in developing epithelia, but how strain directs a Fz-PCP vector is not known. Here we use live cell imaging of apical microtubules (MTs) and components of the Fz-PCP pathway to analyze epithelial cells in Xenopus embryos as they respond to anisotropic mechanical strain and form a Fz-PCP axis. We find that a Fz-PCP axis can be detected approximately 40 min after the application of strain. By contrast, the density and length of apical MTs increases rapidly (5–10 min) in response to strain, independently of Fz-PCP. These early-forming apical MTs are planar polarized: they align to the strain axis and display a marked bias in plus-end orientation that invariably points towards the cell edge opposite the direction of strain application. We show that these MTs can promote the vectorial transport of Dvl3-GFP containing vesicles along the apical surface in a directed manner, perhaps explaining why PCP signaling fails when MTs are disrupted. Finally, we provide evidence that the Fz-PCP axis feeds back after an hour to stabilize oriented apical MTs. These results provide insights into how mechanical strain acts as a developmental cue within the appropriate time frame and with the appropriate vector to promote planar axis formation.

Abstract: Summary
RAF protein kinases are effectors of the GTP-bound form of small guanosine triphosphatase RAS and function by phosphorylating MEK. We showed here that the expression of ARAF activated RAS in a kinase-independent manner. Binding of ARAF to RAS displaced the GTPase-activating protein NF1 and antagonized NF1-mediated inhibition of RAS. This reduced ERK-dependent inhibition of RAS and increased RAS-GTP. By this mechanism, ARAF regulated the duration and consequences of RTK-induced RAS activation and supported the RAS output of RTK-dependent tumor cells. In human lung cancers with EGFR mutation, amplification of ARAF was associated with acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors, which was overcome by combining EGFR inhibitors with an inhibitor of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 to enhance inhibition of nucleotide exchange and RAS activation.

Abstract: Summary
Dopamine modulation of nucleus accumbens (NAc) circuitry is central to theories of reward seeking and reinforcement learning. Despite decades of effort, the acute dopamine actions on the NAc microcircuitry remain puzzling. Here, we dissect out the direct actions of dopamine on lateral inhibition between medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in mouse brain slices and find that they are pathway specific. Dopamine potently depresses GABAergic transmission from presynaptic dopamine D2 receptor-expressing MSNs (D2-MSNs), whereas it potentiates transmission from presynaptic dopamine D1 receptor-expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs) onto other D1-MSNs. To our surprise, presynaptic D2 receptors mediate only half of the depression induced by endogenous and exogenous dopamine. Presynaptic serotonin 5-HT1B receptors are responsible for a significant component of dopamine-induced synaptic depression. This study clarifies the mechanistic understanding of dopamine actions in the NAc by showing pathway-specific modulation of lateral inhibition and involvement of D2 and 5-HT1B receptors in dopamine depression of D2-MSN synapses.

Abstract: Summary
T cell pathology in the skin leads to monocyte influx, but we have little understanding of the fate of recruited cells within the diseased niche, or the long-term impact on cutaneous immune homeostasis. By combining a murine model of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) with analysis of patient samples, we demonstrate that pathology initiates dermis-specific macrophage differentiation and show that aGVHD-primed macrophages continue to dominate the dermal compartment at the relative expense of quiescent MHCIIint cells. Exposure of the altered dermal niche to topical haptens after disease resolution results in hyper-activation of regulatory T cells (Treg), but local breakdown in tolerance. Disease-imprinted macrophages express increased IL-1β and are predicted to elicit altered TNF superfamily interactions with cutaneous Treg, and we demonstrate the direct loss of T cell regulation within the resolved skin. Thus, T cell pathology leaves an immunological scar in the skin marked by failure to re-set immune homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome of humans and animals is critical to host health. Mice are used to investigate the microbiome and its influences; however, the predictive value of such studies is hindered by cage effects due to coprophagy. Our objectives were to evaluate the influence of cage density on the statistical power to detect treatment-dependent effects of a selective pressure on microbiome composition. C57BL/6 mice were separated into groups of 2 or 4 mice per cage and then assigned to groups receiving enrofloxacin, broad-spectrum antibiotics, or control. Fecal samples were collected at weeks 0, 1, and 4, along with contents of the jejunum and cecum. Bacterial DNA analysis examined microbiome richness, diversity, and variability within and between cages. Statistical analyses reveal that reduced housing density consistently results in comparable susceptibility to antibiotics, reduced cage effects, and increased statistical power to detect treatment-associated effects, justifying the practice of reduced housing density.

Abstract: Summary
HIV/Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) co-infected individuals have an increased risk of tuberculosis prior to loss of peripheral CD4 T cells, raising the possibility that HIV co-infection leads to CD4 T cell depletion in lung tissue before it is evident in blood. Here, we use rhesus macaques to study the early effects of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) co-infection on pulmonary granulomas. Two weeks after SIV inoculation of Mtb-infected macaques, Mtb-specific CD4 T cells are dramatically depleted from granulomas, before CD4 T cell loss in blood, airways, and lymph nodes, or increases in bacterial loads or radiographic evidence of disease. Spatially, CD4 T cells are preferentially depleted from the granuloma core and cuff relative to B cell-rich regions. Moreover, live imaging of granuloma explants show that intralesional CD4 T cell motility is reduced after SIV co-infection. Thus, granuloma CD4 T cells may be decimated before many co-infected individuals experience the first symptoms of acute HIV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Despite SARS-CoV-2 being a “novel” virus, early detection of anti-spike IgG in severe COVID-19 patients may be caused by the amplification of humoral memory responses against seasonal coronaviruses. Here, we examine this phenomenon by characterizing anti-spike IgG responses in non-hospitalized convalescent individuals across a spectrum of COVID-19 severity. We observe that disease severity positively correlates with anti-spike IgG levels, IgG cross-reactivity against other betacoronaviruses (β-CoVs), and FcγR activation. Analysis of IgG targeting β-CoV-conserved and non-conserved immunodominant epitopes within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein revealed epitope-specific relationships: IgG targeting the conserved heptad repeat (HR) 2 region significantly correlates with milder disease, while targeting the conserved S2′FP region correlates with more severe disease. Furthermore, a lower HR2-to-S2′FP IgG-binding ratio correlates with greater disease severity, with ICU-hospitalized COVID-19 patients showing the lowest HR2/S2′FP ratios. These findings suggest that HR2/S2′FP IgG profiles may predict disease severity and offer insight into protective versus deleterious humoral recall responses.

Abstract: Summary
Immature autoreactive B cells are present in all healthy individuals, but it is unclear which signals are required for their maturation into antibody-producing cells. Inducible depletion of γδ T cells show that direct interaction between γδ T cells and immature B cells in the spleen support an “innate” transition to mature B cells with a broad range of antigen specificities. IL-4 production of γδ T cells and cell-to-cell contact via CD30L support B cell maturation and induce genes of the unfolded protein response and mTORC1 signaling. Eight days after in vivo depletion of γδ T cells, increased numbers of B cells are already stuck in the transitional phase and express increased levels of IgD and CD21. Absence of γδ T cells leads also to reduced levels of serum anti-nuclear autoantibodies, making γδ T cells an attractive target to treat autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
Light and temperature in plants are perceived by a common receptor, phytochrome B (phyB). How phyB distinguishes these signals remains elusive. Here, we report that phyB spontaneously undergoes phase separation to assemble liquid-like droplets. This capacity is driven by its C terminus through self-association, whereas the intrinsically disordered N-terminal extension (NTE) functions as a biophysical modulator of phase separation. Light exposure triggers a conformational change to subsequently alter phyB condensate assembly, while temperature sensation is directly mediated by the NTE to modulate the phase behavior of phyB droplets. Multiple signaling components are selectively incorporated into phyB droplets to form concentrated microreactors, allowing switch-like control of phyB signaling activity through phase transitions. Therefore, light and temperature cues are separately read out by phyB via allosteric changes and spontaneous phase separation, respectively. We provide a conceptual framework showing how the distinct but highly correlated physical signals are interpreted and sorted by one receptor.

Abstract: Common marmosets are non-human primate models used in biomedical research and genome editing technology. This study aimed to establish cell lines from common marmosets and evaluate their characteristics. We obtained normal fibroblasts derived from muscle tissues of two common marmosets and immortalized them with the introduction of a mutat form of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4R24C), Cyclin D1, and telomere reverse transcriptase (TERT) using the piggyBac transposon. Compared to parental cells, the immortalized cell lines (named K4DT cells) showed telomerase activity and an accelerated cell proliferation rate. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the successful establishment of immortalized common marmoset-derived fibroblasts using piggyBac transposition of CDK4R24C, Cyclin D1, and TERT. Our generated cell lines might be a beneficial tool for future studies on disease modeling and targeted gene therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Aerobic exercise is associated with decreased cancer incidence and cancer-associated mortality. However, little is known about the effects of exercise on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), a disease for which current therapeutic options are limited. Herein, we show that aerobic exercise reduces PDA tumor growth, by modulating systemic and intra-tumoral immunity. Mechanistically, exercise promotes immune mobilization and accumulation of tumor-infiltrating IL15Rα+ CD8 T cells, which are responsible for the tumor-protective effects. In clinical samples, an exercise-dependent increase of intra-tumoral CD8 T cells is also observed. Underscoring the translational potential of the interleukin (IL)-15/IL-15Rα axis, IL-15 super-agonist (NIZ985) treatment attenuates tumor growth, prolongs survival, and enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy. Finally, exercise or NIZ985 both sensitize pancreatic tumors to αPD-1, with improved anti-tumor and survival benefits. Collectively, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of an exercise-oncology axis and identify IL-15 activation as a promising treatment strategy for this deadly disease.

Abstract: Summary
To assess the transcriptomic profile of disease-specific cell populations, fibroblasts from patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) before being differentiated into retinal organoids and compared with those from healthy individuals. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of a total of 247,520 cells and identified cluster-specific molecular signatures. Comparing the gene expression profile between cases and controls, we identified novel genetic associations for this blinding disease. Expression quantitative trait mapping identified a total of 4,443 significant loci across all cell types, 312 of which are specific to the retinal ganglion cell subpopulations, which ultimately degenerate in POAG. Transcriptome-wide association analysis identified genes at loci previously associated with POAG, and analysis, conditional on disease status, implicated 97 statistically significant retinal ganglion cell-specific expression quantitative trait loci. This work highlights the power of large-scale iPSC studies to uncover context-specific profiles for a genetically complex disease.

Abstract: Summary
Complement is operative in not only the extracellular but also the intracellular milieu. However, little is known about the role of complement activation inside tumor cells. Here, we report that intracellular C5 is cleaved by cathepsin D (CTSD) to produce C5a in lysosomes and endosomes of colonic cancer cells. After stimulation by C5a, intracellular C5aR1 assembles a complex with KCTD5/cullin3/Roc-1 and β-catenin to promote the switch of polyubiquitination of β-catenin from K48 to K63, which enhances β-catenin stability. Genetic loss or pharmacological blockade of C5aR1 dramatically impedes colorectal tumorigenesis at least by destabilizing β-catenin. In human colorectal cancer specimens, high levels of C5aR1, C5a, and CTSD are closely correlated with elevated β-catenin levels and a poor prognosis. Importantly, intracellular C5a/C5aR1-mediated β-catenin stabilization is also observed ubiquitously in other cell types. Collectively, we identify a machinery for β-catenin activation and provide a potential target for tumor prevention and treatment.

Abstract: Exposure to various organic compounds including several environmental pollutants and drugs can cause cellular damage through the generation of lipid peroxidation products. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) is a potent toxic agent that causes peroxidative degeneration in many tissues. Dexpanthenol (Dxp) is a member of the B complex vitamins that exhibits antioxidant effects against lipid peroxidation products. This study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of Dxp against CCl4-induced myocardial toxicity in rats. Administration of a single dose of CCl4 caused cardiotoxicity by the increase in lipid peroxidation and histopathological changes (cardiomyocytes degeneration, interstitial edema) in the myocardial tissue. Moreover, CCl4 caused a decrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and troponin-I immunoreactivities, while significantly increasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and caspase-3 immunoreactivities. On the other hand, administration of Dxp improved biochemical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical parameters compared to the CCl4 treated group. Overall, this study suggests that Dxp is effective in inhibiting CCl4-induced lipid peroxidation, and that administration of Dxp may help prevent CCl4 related inflammation, necrosis, and apoptosis on the cardiac tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified hundreds of loci associated with psychiatric diseases, yet there is a lack of understanding of disease pathophysiology. Common risk variants can shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms; however, identifying causal variants remains challenging. We map cis-regulatory elements in human neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells. This system allows us to determine enhancers that activate the transcription of neuronal activity-regulated gene programs, which are thought to be critical for synaptic plasticity and are not possible to identify from postmortem tissues. Using the activity-by-contact model, we create variant-to-gene maps to interpret the function of GWAS variants. Our work nominates a subset of variants to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involving GWAS-significant loci. It also highlights that in vitro human cellular models are a powerful platform for identifying and mechanistic studies of human trait-associated genetic variants in cell states that are inaccessible from other types of human samples.

Abstract: The intricate glia interaction occurring after stroke strongly depend on the maintenance of intraglial ionic homeostasis. Among the several ionic channels and transporters, the plasmamembrane Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) represents a key player in maintaining astroglial Na+ and Ca2+ homeostasis. Here, using a combined in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo experimental strategy we evaluated whether microglia responding to ischemic injury may influence the morphological and the transcriptional plasticity of post-ischemic astrocytes. Astrocyte plasticity was monitored by the expression of the transcription factor Acheate-scute like 1 (Ascl1), which plays a central role in the commitment of astrocytes towards the neuronal lineage. Furthermore, we explored the implication of NCX1 expression and activity in mediating Ascl1-dependent post-ischemic astrocyte remodeling. We demonstrated that: (a) in astrocytes co-cultured with microglia the exposure to oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by 7 days of reoxygenation induced a prevalence of bipolar astrocytes overexpressing Ascl1 and NCX1, whereas this did not occur in monocultured astrocytes; (b) the reoxygenation of anoxic astrocytes with the conditioned medium derived from IL-4 stimulated microglia strongly elicited the astrocytic co-expression of Ascl1 and NCX1; (c) Ascl1 expression in anoxic astrocytes was dependenton NCX1 since its silencing prevented Ascl1 expression both in in vitro and in post-ischemic ex vivo experimental conditions. Collectively, the results of our study support the idea that, after brain ischemia, astrocyte-microglia crosstalk can influence astrocytic morphology and its Ascl1 expression. This phenomenon is strictly dependent on ischemia-induced increase of NCX1 which in turn induces Ascl1 overexpression possibly through astrocytic Ca2+ elevation.

Abstract: Summary
A myriad of pathological changes associated with epilepsy can be recast as decreases in cell and circuit heterogeneity. We thus propose recontextualizing epileptogenesis as a process where reduction in cellular heterogeneity, in part, renders neural circuits less resilient to seizure. By comparing patch clamp recordings from human layer 5 (L5) cortical pyramidal neurons from epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic tissue, we demonstrate significantly decreased biophysical heterogeneity in seizure-generating areas. Implemented computationally, this renders model neural circuits prone to sudden transitions into synchronous states with increased firing activity, paralleling ictogenesis. This computational work also explains the surprising finding of significantly decreased excitability in the population-activation functions of neurons from epileptogenic tissue. Finally, mathematical analyses reveal a bifurcation structure arising only with low heterogeneity and associated with seizure-like dynamics. Taken together, this work provides experimental, computational, and mathematical support for the theory that ictogenic dynamics accompany a reduction in biophysical heterogeneity.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression is in part controlled by cis-regulatory elements (CREs) such as enhancers and repressive elements. Anecdotal evidence has indicated that a CRE and a promoter need to be biochemically compatible for promoter regulation to occur, but this compatibility has remained poorly characterized in mammalian cells. We used high-throughput combinatorial reporter assays to test thousands of CRE-promoter pairs from three Mb-sized genomic regions in mouse cells. This revealed that CREs vary substantially in their promoter compatibility, ranging from striking specificity to broad promiscuity. More than half of the tested CREs exhibit significant promoter selectivity. Housekeeping promoters tend to have similar CRE preferences, but other promoters exhibit a wide diversity of compatibilities. Higher-order transcription factors (TF) motif combinations may account for compatibility. CRE-promoter selectivity does not correlate with looping interactions in the native genomic context, suggesting that chromatin folding and compatibility are two orthogonal mechanisms that confer specificity to gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding which biological pathways are specific versus general across diagnostic categories and levels of symptom severity is critical to improving nosology and treatment of psychopathology. Here, we combine transdiagnostic and dimensional approaches to genetic discovery for the first time, conducting a novel multivariate genome-wide association study of eight psychiatric symptoms and disorders broadly related to mood disturbance and psychosis. We identify two transdiagnostic genetic liabilities that distinguish between common forms of psychopathology versus rarer forms of serious mental illness. Biological annotation revealed divergent genetic architectures that differentially implicated prenatal neurodevelopment and neuronal function and regulation. These findings inform psychiatric nosology and biological models of psychopathology, as they suggest that the severity of mood and psychotic symptoms present in serious mental illness may reflect a difference in kind rather than merely in degree.

Abstract: Summary
Tumors are heterogeneous cellular environments with entwined metabolic dependencies. Here, we use a tumor transcriptome deconvolution approach to profile the metabolic states of cancer and non-cancer (stromal) cells in bulk tumors of 20 solid tumor types. We identify metabolic genes and processes recurrently altered in cancer cells across tumor types, highlighting pan-cancer upregulation of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) production. In contrast, the tryptophan catabolism rate-limiting enzymes IDO1 and TDO2 are highly overexpressed in stroma, raising the hypothesis that kynurenine-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity may be predominantly constrained by the stroma. Oxidative phosphorylation is the most upregulated metabolic process in cancer cells compared to both stromal cells and a large atlas of cancer cell lines, suggesting that the Warburg effect may be less pronounced in cancer cells in vivo. Overall, our analysis highlights fundamental differences in metabolic states of cancer and stromal cells inside tumors and establishes a pan-cancer resource to interrogate tumor metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
A major challenge in understanding vertebrate embryogenesis is the lack of topographical transcriptomic information that can help correlate microenvironmental cues within the hierarchy of cell-fate decisions. Here, we employed Stereo-seq to profile 91 zebrafish embryo sections covering six critical time points during the first 24 h of development, obtaining a total of 152,977 spots at a resolution of 10 × 10 × 15 μm3 (close to cellular size) with spatial coordinates. Meanwhile, we identified spatial modules and co-varying genes for specific tissue organizations. By performing the integrated analysis of the Stereo-seq and scRNA-seq data from each time point, we reconstructed the spatially resolved developmental trajectories of cell-fate transitions and molecular changes during zebrafish embryogenesis. We further investigated the spatial distribution of ligand-receptor pairs and identified potentially important interactions during zebrafish embryo development. Our study constitutes a fundamental reference for further studies aiming to understand vertebrate development.

Abstract: E3 ligase BRUTUS (BTS), a putative iron sensor, is expressed in both root and shoot tissues in seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana. The role of BTS in root tissues has been well established. However, its role in shoot tissues has been scarcely studied. Comparative transcriptome analysis with shoot and root tissues revealed that BTS is involved in regulating energy metabolism by modulating expression of mitochondrial and chloroplast genes in shoot tissues. Moreover, in shoot tissues of bts-1 plants, levels of ADP and ATP and the ratio of ADP/ATP were greatly increased with a concomitant decrease in levels of soluble sugar and starch. The decreased starch level in bts-1 shoot tissues was restored to the level of shoot tissues of wild-type plants upon vanadate treatment. Through this study, we expand the role of BTS to regulation of energy metabolism in the shoot in addition to its role of iron deficiency response in roots.

Abstract: Summary
Voluntary movements are driven by coordinated activity across a large population of motor cortical neurons. Formation of this activity is controlled by local interactions and long-range inputs. How remote areas of the brain communicate with motor cortical neurons to effectively drive movement remains unclear. We address this question by studying the cerebellar-thalamocortical system. We find that thalamic input to the motor cortex triggers feedforward inhibition by contacting inhibitory cells via highly effective GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors and that, during task performance, the activity of parvalbumin (PV) and pyramidal cells exhibits relations comparable with movement parameters. We also find that the movement-related activity of PV interneurons precedes firing of pyramidal cells. This counterintuitive sequence of events, where inhibitory cells are recruited more strongly and before excitatory cells, may amplify the cortical effect of cerebellar signals in a way that exceeds their sheer synaptic efficacy by suppressing other inputs.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the subsequent metabolic reprogramming play critical roles in cancer progression. Our previous study has shown that Golgi membrane protein 1 (GOLM1) promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis by enhancing the recycling of RTKs. However, how this RTK recycling process is regulated and coupled with RTK degradation remains poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that cholesterol suppresses the autophagic degradation of RTKs in a GOLM1-dependent manner. Further mechanistic studies reveal that GOLM1 mediates the selective autophagy of RTKs by interacting with LC3 through an LC3-interacting region (LIR), which is regulated by a cholesterol-mTORC1 axis. Lowering cholesterol by statins improves the efficacy of multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in vivo. Our findings indicate that cholesterol serves as a signal to switch GOLM1-RTK degradation to GOLM1-RTK recycling and suggest that lowering cholesterol by statin may be a promising combination strategy to improve the TKI efficiency in HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiating stem cells must coordinate their metabolism and fate trajectories. Here, we report that the catalytic activity of the glycolytic enzyme Enolase 1 (ENO1) is directly regulated by RNAs leading to metabolic rewiring in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We identify RNA ligands that specifically inhibit ENO1’s enzymatic activity in vitro and diminish glycolysis in cultured human cells and mESCs. Pharmacological inhibition or RNAi-mediated depletion of the protein deacetylase SIRT2 increases ENO1’s acetylation and enhances its RNA binding. Similarly, induction of mESC differentiation leads to increased ENO1 acetylation, enhanced RNA binding, and inhibition of glycolysis. Stem cells expressing mutant forms of ENO1 that escape or hyper-activate this regulation display impaired germ layer differentiation. Our findings uncover acetylation-driven riboregulation of ENO1 as a physiological mechanism of glycolytic control and of the regulation of stem cell differentiation. Riboregulation may represent a more widespread principle of biological control.

Abstract: Aging is a continuous and irreversible process that leads to a progressive deterioration in cardiac geometry and function. Klotho is an anti-aging protein with cardioprotective effect. However, the relationship between Klotho and cardiac aging and its possible mechanism are not completely clear. We applied D-galactosamine (D-Gal) to replicate cardiac senescence by increasing oxidative stress in the heart. M2 anti-inflammatory markers in the aging hearts were observed significantly lower than those in adult mice. Therefore, in this study, we demonstrated that serum soluble Klotho (sKL) could exert its cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects by regulating the phenotype of macrophages by inhibiting TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB. In terms of mechanism, supplementation of serum soluble Klotho can prevent excessive oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction in the aging heart. In RAW264.7 cells, sKL induced macrophages to differentiate into M2a/M2c macrophages, and the culture supernatant of M2a/M2c macrophages significantly reversed the senescence of cardiomyocytes and improved myocardial viability compared with the control group. Therefore, supplementation of sKL can improve aging cardiac function, reduce cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis by promoting M2a/M2c polarized macrophages via inhibiting the TLR4/Myd88/NF-κB pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Although midbrain dopamine (DA) circuits are central to motivated behaviors, our knowledge of how experience modifies these circuits to facilitate subsequent behavioral adaptations is limited. Here we demonstrate the selective role of a ventral tegmental area DA projection to the amygdala (VTADA→amygdala) for cocaine-induced anxiety but not cocaine reward or sensitization. Our rabies virus-mediated circuit mapping approach reveals a persistent elevation in spontaneous and task-related activity of inhibitory GABAergic cells from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and downstream VTADA→amygdala cells that can be detected even after a single cocaine exposure. Activity in BNSTGABA→midbrain cells is related to cocaine-induced anxiety but not reward or sensitization, and silencing this projection prevents development of anxiety during protracted withdrawal after cocaine administration. Finally, we observe that VTADA→amygdala cells are strongly activated after a challenge exposure to cocaine and that activity in these cells is necessary and sufficient for reinstatement of cocaine place preference.

Abstract: Summary
Leydig cells (LCs) are the major androgen-producing cells in the testis. They arise from steroidogenic progenitors (SPs), whose origins, maintenance, and differentiation dynamics remain largely unknown. Single-cell transcriptomics reveal that the mouse steroidogenic lineage is specified as early as embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and has a dual mesonephric and coelomic origin. SPs specifically express the Wnt5a gene and evolve rapidly. At E12.5 and E13.5, they give rise first to an intermediate population of pre-LCs, and finally to fetal LCs. At E16.5, SPs possess the characteristics of the dormant progenitors at the origin of adult LCs and are also transcriptionally closely related to peritubular myoid cells (PMCs). In agreement with our in silico analysis, in vivo lineage tracing indicates that Wnt5a-expressing cells are bona fide progenitors of PMCs as well as fetal and adult LCs, contributing to most of the LCs present in the fetal and adult testis.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear deformation, a hallmark frequently observed in senescent cells, is presumed to be associated with the erosion of chromatin organization at the nuclear periphery. However, how such gradual changes in higher-order genome organization impinge on local epigenetic modifications to drive cellular mechanisms of aging has remained enigmatic. Here, through large-scale epigenomic analyses of isogenic young, senescent, and progeroid human mesenchymal progenitor cells (hMPCs), we delineate a hierarchy of integrated structural state changes that manifest as heterochromatin loss in repressive compartments, euchromatin weakening in active compartments, switching in interfacing topological compartments, and increasing epigenetic entropy. We found that the epigenetic de-repression unlocks the expression of pregnancy-specific beta-1 glycoprotein (PSG) genes that exacerbate hMPC aging and serve as potential aging biomarkers. Our analyses provide a rich resource for uncovering the principles of epigenomic landscape organization and its changes in cellular aging and for identifying aging drivers and intervention targets with a genome-topology-based mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells are highly heterogeneous at the transcriptional level and epigenetic state. Methods to study epigenetic heterogeneity are limited in throughput and information obtained per cell. Here, we adapted cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to analyze a wide panel of histone modifications in primary tumor-derived lines of diffused intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). DIPG is a lethal glioma, driven by a histone H3 lysine 27 mutation (H3-K27M). We identified two epigenetically distinct subpopulations in DIPG, reflecting inherent heterogeneity in expression of the mutant histone. These two subpopulations are robust across tumor lines derived from different patients and show differential proliferation capacity and expression of stem cell and differentiation markers. Moreover, we demonstrate the use of these high-dimensional data to elucidate potential interactions between histone modifications and epigenetic alterations during the cell cycle. Our work establishes new concepts for the analysis of epigenetic heterogeneity in cancer that could be applied to diverse biological systems.

Abstract: Summary
Linear motifs have an integral role in dynamic cell functions, including cell signaling. However, due to their small size, low complexity, and frequent mutations, identifying novel functional motifs poses a challenge. Viruses rely extensively on the molecular mimicry of cellular linear motifs. In this study, we apply systematic motif prediction combined with functional filters to identify human linear motifs convergently evolved also in viral proteins. We observe an increase in the sensitivity of motif prediction and improved enrichment in known instances. We identify >7,300 non-redundant motif instances at various confidence levels, 99 of which are supported by all functional and structural filters. Overall, we provide a pipeline to improve the identification of functional linear motifs from interactomics datasets and a comprehensive catalog of putative human motifs that can contribute to our understanding of the human domain-linear motif code and the associated mechanisms of viral interference.

Abstract: Summary
Inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), controlled by cyclin B1 proteolysis, orders events during mitotic exit. Here, we used a FRET biosensor to study Cdk1 activity while simultaneously monitoring anaphase II and pronuclear (PN) formation in live mouse eggs throughout fertilization. We find that Cdk1 inactivation occurs over two phases separated by a 3-h pause, the first induces anaphase II and the second induces PN formation. Although both phases require the inhibitory Cdk1 kinase Wee1B, only the first involves cyclin B1 proteolysis. Enforcing the 3-h pause is critical for providing the delay required for male PN formation and is mediated by spindle midzone-dependent sequestration of Wee1B between the first and second phases. Thus, unlike continuous Cdk1 inactivation driven by cyclin B1 proteolysis during mitotic exit, MII oocytes engineer a physiologically important pause during fertilization involving two different pathways to inactivate Cdk1, only the first of which requires proteolysis.

Abstract: Summary
Sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and common-cold human coronaviruses (HCoVs) raises the possibility that memory responses to prior HCoV infection can affect T cell response in COVID-19. We studied T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs in convalescent COVID-19 donors and identified a highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 sequence, S811-831, with overlapping epitopes presented by common MHC class II proteins HLA-DQ5 and HLA-DP4. These epitopes are recognized by low-abundance CD4 T cells from convalescent COVID-19 donors, mRNA vaccine recipients, and uninfected donors. TCR sequencing revealed a diverse repertoire with public TCRs. T cell cross-reactivity is driven by the high conservation across human and animal coronaviruses of T cell contact residues in both HLA-DQ5 and HLA-DP4 binding frames, with distinct patterns of HCoV cross-reactivity explained by MHC class II binding preferences and substitutions at secondary TCR contact sites. These data highlight S811-831 as a highly conserved CD4 T cell epitope broadly recognized across human populations.

Abstract: Summary
The integration of HIV-1 DNA into the host genome results in single-strand gaps and 2-nt overhangs at the ends of viral DNA, which must be repaired by cellular enzymes. The cellular factors responsible for the DNA damage repair in HIV-1 DNA integration have not yet been well defined. We report here that HIV-1 infection potently activates the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, and the FA effector proteins FANCI-D2 bind to the C-terminal domain of HIV-1 integrase. Knockout of FANCI blocks productive viral DNA integration and inhibits the replication of HIV-1. Finally, we show that the knockout of DNA polymerases or flap nuclease downstream of FANCI-D2 reduces the levels of integrated HIV-1 DNA, suggesting these enzymes may be responsible for the repair of DNA damages induced by viral DNA integration. These experiments reveal that HIV-1 exploits the FA pathway for the stable integration of viral DNA into host genome.

Abstract: Summary
Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a specialized export pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have recently shown that a very-long acyl chain (C26) ceramide present in the ER membrane drives clustering and sorting of GPI-APs into selective ER exit sites (ERES). Now, we show that this lipid-based ER sorting also involves the C26 ceramide as a lipid moiety of GPI-APs, which is incorporated into the GPI anchor through a lipid-remodeling process after protein attachment in the ER. Moreover, we also show that a GPI-AP with a C26 ceramide moiety is monitored by the GPI-glycan remodelase Ted1, which, in turn, is required for receptor-mediated export of GPI-APs. Therefore, our study reveals a quality-control system that ensures lipid-based sorting of GPI-APs into selective ERESs for differential ER export, highlighting the physiological need for this specific export pathway.

To elucidate the function of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) during B cell differentiation, we employ CD23Cre-driven expression of the dominant-negative K320E mutant of the mitochondrial helicase Twinkle (DNT). DNT-expression depletes mitochondrial DNA during B cell maturation, reduces the abundance of respiratory chain protein subunits encoded by mitochondrial DNA, and, consequently, respiratory chain super-complexes in activated B cells. Whereas B cell development in DNT mice is normal, B cell proliferation, germinal centers, class switch to IgG, plasma cell maturation, and T cell-dependent as well as T cell-independent humoral immunity are diminished. DNT expression dampens OxPhos but increases glycolysis in lipopolysaccharide and B cell receptor-activated cells. Lipopolysaccharide-activated DNT-B cells exhibit altered metabolites of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle and a lower amount of phosphatidic acid. Consequently, mTORC1 activity and BLIMP1 induction are curtailed, whereas HIF1α is stabilized. Hence, mitochondrial DNA controls the metabolism of activated B cells via OxPhos to foster humoral immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have identified a unique cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) population termed antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs), characterized by the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, suggesting a function in regulating tumor immunity. Here, by integrating multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing studies and performing robust lineage-tracing assays, we find that apCAFs are derived from mesothelial cells. During pancreatic cancer progression, mesothelial cells form apCAFs by downregulating mesothelial features and gaining fibroblastic features, a process induced by interleukin-1 and transforming growth factor β. apCAFs directly ligate and induce naive CD4+ T cells into regulatory T cells (Tregs) in an antigen-specific manner. Moreover, treatment with an antibody targeting the mesothelial cell marker mesothelin can effectively inhibit mesothelial cell to apCAF transition and Treg formation induced by apCAFs. Taken together, our study elucidates how mesothelial cells may contribute to immune evasion in pancreatic cancer and provides insight on strategies to enhance cancer immune therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and fatal disease of all brain tumor types. Most therapies rarely provide clinically meaningful outcomes in the treatment of GBM. Although antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are promising anticancer drugs, no ADCs have been clinically successful for GBM, primarily because of poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Here, we report that ADC homogeneity and payload loading rate are critical parameters contributing to this discrepancy. Although both homogeneous and heterogeneous conjugates exhibit comparable in vitro potency and pharmacokinetic profiles, the former shows enhanced payload delivery to brain tumors. Our homogeneous ADCs provide improved antitumor effects and survival benefits in orthotopic brain tumor models. We also demonstrate that overly drug-loaded species in heterogeneous conjugates are particularly poor at crossing the BBB, leading to deteriorated overall brain tumor targeting. Our findings indicate the importance of homogeneous conjugation with optimal payload loading in generating effective ADCs for intractable brain tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron BA.2 sub-lineage has gained in proportion relative to BA.1. Because spike (S) protein variations may underlie differences in their pathobiology, here we determine cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the BA.2 S ectodomain and compare these with previously determined BA.1 S structures. BA.2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutations induce remodeling of the RBD structure, resulting in tighter packing and improved thermostability. Interprotomer RBD interactions are enhanced in the closed (or 3-RBD-down) BA.2 S, while the fusion peptide is less accessible to antibodies than in BA.1. Binding and pseudovirus neutralization assays reveal extensive immune evasion while defining epitopes of two outer RBD face-binding antibodies, DH1044 and DH1193, that neutralize both BA.1 and BA.2. Taken together, our results indicate that stabilization of the closed state through interprotomer RBD-RBD packing is a hallmark of the Omicron variant and show differences in key functional regions in the BA.1 and BA.2 S proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor Myc drives cell growth across animal phyla and is activated in most forms of human cancer. However, it is unclear which Myc target genes need to be regulated to induce growth and whether multiple targets act additively or if induction of each target is individually necessary. Here, we identified Myc target genes whose regulation is conserved between humans and flies and deleted Myc-binding sites (E-boxes) in the promoters of fourteen of these genes in Drosophila. E-box mutants of essential genes were homozygous viable, indicating that the E-boxes are not required for basal expression. Eight E-box mutations led to Myc-like phenotypes; the strongest mutant, ppanEbox−/−, also made the flies resistant to Myc-induced cell growth without affecting Myc-induced apoptosis. The ppanEbox−/− flies are healthy and display only a minor developmental delay, suggesting that it may be possible to treat or prevent tumorigenesis by targeting individual downstream targets of Myc.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR systems are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems that use RNA-guided Cas nucleases to recognize and destroy foreign genetic elements. To overcome CRISPR immunity, bacteriophages have evolved diverse families of anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs). Recently, Lin et al. (2020) described the discovery and characterization of 7 Acr families (AcrVIA1-7) that inhibit type VI-A CRISPR systems. We detail several inconsistencies that question the results reported in the Lin et al. (2020) study. These include inaccurate bioinformatics analyses and bacterial strains that are impossible to construct. Published strains were provided by the authors, but MS2 bacteriophage plaque assays did not support the published results. We also independently tested the Acr sequences described in the original report, in E. coli and mammalian cells, but did not observe anti-Cas13a activity. Taken together, our data and analyses prompt us to question the claim that AcrVIA1-7 reported in Lin et al. are type VI anti-CRISPR proteins.

Abstract: Background and objective
Improving ability to predict the prognosis of patients with progressive lung cancer is an important task in the era of precision medicine. Here, a predictive model based on liquid biopsy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was established to improve prognosis prediction in patients with progressive NSCLC.
Methods
Clinical data and blood samples of 500 eligible patients were collected and screened from the electronic case database and blood sample center of Hwa Mei Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Ningbo Institute of Life and Health Industry, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Patients were randomly assigned to training set (300 cases) and validation set (200 cases) in a ratio of 3:2 by random number method. Baseline levels of the two datasets were compared. Progression-free survival (PFS) analysis was performed on the training set using Kaplan-Meier method. The independent prognostic factors affecting patients’ PFS were determined by multivariate Cox regression analysis. The prognosis predictive model of patients was constructed by using the nomogram. Calibration curve and C-index were used to evaluate the accuracy of the prognosis predictive model in both internal and external validations.
Results
In training set, the age distribution of patients was 59.00 (46.00, 71.00) years, including 137 (45.7 %) females and 163 (54.3 %) males, 198 cases (66.0 %) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score 0–1, and 102 cases (34.0 %) with ECOG score 2. In verification set, the age distribution of patients was 60.00 (48.25, 73.00) years, including 92 females (46.0 %) and 108 males (54.0 %), 130 cases (65.0%) with ECOG score 0–1, and 70 cases (35.0 %) with ECOG score 2. Patients in training set showed PFS differences stratified by gene mutation type (p < 0.0001), differentiation degree (p < 0.0001), circulating tumor cell (CTC) content (p = 0.00026), and brain metastasis (p < 0.0001). Besides, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that gene mutation type, differentiation degree, CTC content (p = 0.002), and brain metastasis (p = 0.005) are independent prognostic factors for PFS. These factors were included in the nomogram parameters, and both internally validated calibration curve (C-index = 0.672) and externally validated calibration curve (C-index = 0.657), showing good predictive performance of the model.
Conclusion
The predictive model has a good predictive ability for prognosis of patients with progressive NSCLC. Notably, the differentiation degree and CTC content are both impact factors for PFS of patients, and the performance of these indicators in predicting the survival of patients with progressive NSCLC needs to be clarified in the future.

Abstract: Malignant meningiomas often show invasive growth that makes complete tumor resection challenging, and they are more prone to recur after radical resection. Invasive meningioma associated transcript 1 (IMAT1) is a long noncoding RNA located on Homo sapiens chromosome 17 that was identified by our team based on absolute expression differences in invasive and non-invasive meningiomas. Our studies indicated that IMAT1 was highly expressed in invasive meningiomas compared with non-invasive meningiomas. In vitro studies showed that IMAT1 promoted meningioma cell invasion through the inactivation of the Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)/hsa-miR22-3p/Snai1 pathway by acting as a sponge for hsa-miR22-3p, and IMAT1 knockdown effectively restored the tumor suppressive properties of KLF4 by preserving its tumor suppressor pathway. In vivo experiments confirmed that IMAT1 silencing could significantly inhibit the growth of subcutaneous tumors and prolong the survival period of tumor-bearing mice. Our findings demonstrated that the high expression of IMAT1 is the inherent reason for the loss of the tumor suppressive properties of KLF4 during meningioma progression. Therefore, we believe that IMAT1 may be a potential biological marker and treatment target for meningiomas.

Abstract: Summary
Cholinergic interneurons (ChINs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been implicated in the extinction of drug associations, as well as related plasticity in medium spiny neurons (MSNs). However, since most previous work relied on artificial manipulations, whether endogenous acetylcholine signaling relates to drug associations is unclear. Moreover, despite great interest in the opposing effects of dopamine on MSN subtypes, whether ChIN-mediated effects vary by MSN subtype is also unclear. Here, we find that high endogenous acetylcholine event frequency correlates with greater extinction of cocaine-context associations across male mice. Additionally, extinction is associated with a weakening of glutamatergic synapses across MSN subtypes. Manipulating ChIN activity bidirectionally controls both the rate of extinction and the associated plasticity at MSNs. Our findings indicate that NAc ChINs mediate drug-context extinction by reducing glutamatergic synaptic strength across MSN subtypes, and that natural variation in acetylcholine signaling may contribute to individual differences in extinction.

Abstract: Craniofacial bone defects cause significant problems to patients with harmful consequences. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can self-renew and exhibit multilineage differentiation, which could be applied to bone regeneration. However, craniofacial bone tissue MSCs have unique properties, differing in their characteristics to MSCs derived from long bones. CDC20 promotes osteogenic differentiation in long bones; however, its role in craniofacial bone tissues remains unknown. In this study, we found that Cdc20 conditional knockout in mice triggered distinctive cranial and mandibular bone loss. Moreover, the osteogenic differentiation potential of cranial suture-derived MSCs and mandibular bone marrow-derived MSCs was impaired in Cdc20 conditional knockout mice. The conditional knockout of Cdc20 impaired osteogenesis in craniofacial bones. Our findings provide new insights into craniofacial bone regeneration and the treatments of craniofacial bone-related diseases.

Abstract: Gain-of-function mutations on STIM1 and ORAI1 genes are responsible for an increased store-operated calcium entry, and underlie the characteristic symptoms of three overlapping ultra-rare genetic disorders (i.e tubular aggregate myopathy, Stormorken syndrome, York platelet syndrome) that can be grouped as tubular aggregate myopathies. These mutations lead to a wide spectrum of defects, which usually include muscle weakness and cramps. Negative modulators of store-operated Ca2+-entry targeting wild-type STIM1 and ORAI1 have entered clinical trials for a different array of disorders, including pancreatitis, COVID-19, cancer, and autoimmune disorders and, while efficacy data is awaited, safety data indicates tolerability of this STIM1/ORAI1 mutations are amenable to pharmacological intervention. If this were so, given that there are no approved treatments or clinical trials ongoing for these rare disorders, it could be envisaged that these agents could also rehabilitate tubular aggregate myopathy patients. In the present contribution we characterized the Ca2+-entry patterns induced by eleven STIM1 and three ORAI1 mutations in heterologous systems or in patient-derived cells, i.e. fibroblasts and myotubes, and evaluated the effect of CIC-37 and CIC-39, two novel store-operated calcium entry modulators. Our data show that all STIM1 and ORAI1 gain-of-function mutations tested, with the possible exception of the R304Q STIM1 mutation, are amenable to inhibition, albeit with slightly different sensitivities, paving the way to the development of SOCE modulators in tubular aggregate myopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Vascular bypass surgery continues to use autologous grafts and often suffers from a shortage of donor grafts. Decellularized xenografts derived from porcine veins provide a promising candidate because of their abundant availability and low immunogenicity. Unfortunately, transplantation outcomes are far from satisfactory because of insufficient regeneration and adverse pathologic remodeling. Herein, a nitrate-functionalized prosthesis has been incorporated into a decellularized porcine vein graft to fabricate a bio-hybrid vascular graft with local delivery of nitric oxide (NO). Exogenous NO efficiently promotes vascular regeneration and attenuates intimal hyperplasia and vascular calcification in both rabbit and mouse models. The underlying mechanism was investigated using a Sca1 2A-CreER; Rosa-RFP genetic-lineage-tracing mouse model that reveals that Sca1+ stem/progenitor cells (SPCs) are major contributors to vascular regeneration and remodeling, and NO plays a critical role in regulating SPC fate. These results support the translational potential of this off-the-shelf vascular graft.

Abstract: Summary
Generalization of visual aversion is a critical function of the brain that supports survival, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are unclear. We establish a rapid generalization procedure for inducing visual aversion by dynamic stripe images. By using fiber photometry, apoptosis, chemogenetic and optogenetic techniques, and behavioral tests, we find that decreased cholinergic neurons’ activity in the medial septum (MS) leads to generalization loss of visual aversion. Strikingly, we identify a projection from MS cholinergic neurons to the medial habenula (MHb) and find that inhibition of the MS→MHb cholinergic circuit disrupts aversion-generalization formation while its continuous activation disrupts subsequent extinction. Further studies show that MS→MHb cholinergic projections modulate the generalization of visual aversion possibly via M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) of downstream neurons coreleasing glutamate and acetylcholine. These findings reveal that the MS→MHb cholinergic circuit is a critical node in aversion-generalization formation and extinction and potentially provides insight into the pathogenesis of affective disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The maintenance of genome stability relies on coordinated control of origin activation and replication fork progression. How the interplay between these processes influences human genetic disease and cancer remains incompletely characterized. Here we show that mouse cells featuring Polε instability exhibit impaired genome-wide activation of DNA replication origins, in an origin-location-independent manner. Strikingly, Trp53 ablation in primary Polε hypomorphic cells increased Polε levels and origin activation and reduced DNA damage in a transcription-dependent manner. Transcriptome analysis of primary Trp53 knockout cells revealed that the TRP53-CDKN1A/P21 axis maintains appropriate levels of replication factors and CDK activity during unchallenged S phase. Loss of this control mechanism deregulates origin activation and perturbs genome-wide replication fork progression. Thus, while our data support an impaired origin activation model for genetic diseases affecting CMG formation, we propose that loss of the TRP53-CDKN1A/P21 tumor suppressor axis induces inappropriate origin activation and deregulates genome-wide fork progression.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects are generally asymptomatic during initial viral replication but may suffer severe immunopathology after the virus has receded and monocytes have infiltrated the airways. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from severe COVID-19 patients, monocytes express mRNA encoding inflammatory mediators and contain SARS-CoV-2 transcripts. We leverage a human small airway model of infection and inflammation, whereby primary blood monocytes transmigrate across SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelium to characterize viral burden, gene expression, and inflammatory mediator secretion by epithelial cells and monocytes. In this model, lung-infiltrating monocytes acquire SARS-CoV-2 from the epithelium and upregulate expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators, mirroring in vivo data. Combined use of baricitinib (Janus kinase inhibitor) and remdesivir (nucleoside analog) enhances antiviral signaling and viral clearance by SARS-CoV-2-positive monocytes while decreasing secretion of proneutrophilic mediators associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. These findings highlight the role of lung-infiltrating monocytes in COVID-19 pathogenesis and their importance as a therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Although KRAS has long been considered undruggable, direct KRASG12C inhibitors have shown promising initial clinical efficacy. However, the majority of patients still fail to respond. Adaptive feedback reactivation of RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling has been proposed by our group and others as a key mediator of resistance, but the exact mechanism driving reactivation and the therapeutic implications are unclear. We find that upstream feedback activation of wild-type RAS, as opposed to a shift in KRASG12C to its active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state, is sufficient to drive RAS-MAPK reactivation in a KRASG12C-independent manner. Moreover, multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can drive feedback reactivation, potentially necessitating targeting of convergent signaling nodes for more universal efficacy. Even in colorectal cancer, where feedback is thought to be primarily epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated, alternative RTKs drive pathway reactivation and limit efficacy, but convergent upstream or downstream signal blockade can enhance activity. Overall, these data provide important mechanistic insight to guide therapeutic strategies targeting KRAS.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the ubiquitous function of macrophages across the body, the diversity, origin, and function of adrenal gland macrophages remain largely unknown. We define the heterogeneity of adrenal gland immune cells using single-cell RNA sequencing and use genetic models to explore the developmental mechanisms yielding macrophage diversity. We define populations of monocyte-derived and embryonically seeded adrenal gland macrophages and identify a female-specific subset with low major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression. In adulthood, monocyte recruitment dominates adrenal gland macrophage maintenance in female mice. Adrenal gland macrophage sub-tissular distribution follows a sex-dimorphic pattern, with MHC class IIlow macrophages located at the cortico-medullary junction. Macrophage sex dimorphism depends on the presence of the cortical X-zone. Adrenal gland macrophage depletion results in altered tissue homeostasis, modulated lipid metabolism, and decreased local aldosterone production during stress exposure. Overall, these data reveal the heterogeneity of adrenal gland macrophages and point toward sex-restricted distribution and functions of these cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse pericentromeric DNA is composed of tandem major satellite repeats, which are heterochromatinized and cluster together to form chromocenters. These clusters are refractory to DNA repair through homologous recombination (HR). The mechanisms by which pericentromeric heterochromatin imposes a barrier on HR and the implications of repeat clustering are unknown. Here, we compare the spatial recruitment of HR factors upon double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) induced in human and mouse pericentromeric heterochromatin, which differ in their capacity to form clusters. We show that while DSBs increase the accessibility of human pericentromeric heterochromatin by disrupting HP1α dimerization, mouse pericentromeric heterochromatin repeat clustering imposes a physical barrier that requires many layers of de-compaction to be accessed. Our results support a model in which the 3D organization of heterochromatin dictates the spatial activation of DNA repair pathways and is key to preventing the activation of HR within clustered repeats and the onset of chromosomal translocations.

Abstract: Summary
Urinary tract infections are predominantly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). UPEC infects bladder epithelial cells (BECs) via fusiform vesicles, escapes into the cytosol to evade exocytosis, and establishes intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) for the next round of infection. The UPEC vesicle escape mechanism remains unclear. Here we show that UPEC senses host immune responses and initiates escape by upregulating a key phospholipase. The UPEC phospholipase PldA disrupts the vesicle membrane, and pldA expression is activated by phosphate reduction in vesicles. The host phosphate transporter PIT1 is located on the fusiform vesicle membrane, transporting phosphate into the cytosol. UPEC infection upregulates PIT1 via nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), resulting in phosphate reduction. Silencing PIT1 blocks UPEC vesicle escape in BECs, inhibits IBC formation in mouse bladders, and protects mice from UPEC infection. Our results shed light on pathogenic bacteria responding to intracellular phosphate shortage and tackling host defense and provide insights for development of new therapeutic agents to treat UPEC infection.

Abstract: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays critical roles in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Autophagy has emerged as a potential mechanism involved in the acquired resistance to anti-EGFR treatments, however, the molecular mechanisms has not been fully addressed. In this study, we identified EGFR interacts with STYK1, a positive autophagy regulator, in EGFR kinase activity dependent manner. We found that EGFR phosphorylates STYK1 at Y356 site and STYK1 inhibits activated EGFR mediated Beclin1 tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction between Bcl2 and Beclin1, thus enhances PtdIns3K-C1 complex assembly and autophagy initiation. We also demonstrated that STYK1 depletion increased the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to EGFR-TKIs in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, EGFR-TKIs induced activation of AMPK phosphorylates STYK1 at S304 site. STYK1 S304 collaborated with Y356 phosphorylation to enhance the EGFR-STYK1 interaction and reverse the inhibitory effects of EGFR to autophagy flux. Collectively, these data revealed new roles and cross-talk between STYK1 and EGFR in autophagy regulation and EGFR-TKIs sensitivity in NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons play a key role in regulating the activity of striatal circuits within the basal ganglia. In addition to dopamine, these neurons release several other transmitters, including the major inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Both dopamine and GABA are loaded into SNc synaptic vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and co-release of GABA provides strong inhibition to the striatum by directly inhibiting striatal medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) through activation of GABAA receptors. Here, we found that despite both dopamine and GABA being co-packaged by VMAT2, the properties of transmission, including Ca2+ sensitivity, release probability, and requirement of active zone scaffolding proteins, differ between the two transmitters. Moreover, the extent by which presynaptic neuromodulators inhibit co-transmission also varied. Differences in modulation and the mechanisms controlling release allow for independent regulation of dopamine and GABA signals despite both being loaded via similar mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Kinesin-1 activity is regulated by autoinhibition. Intramolecular interactions within the kinesin heavy chain (KHC) are proposed to be one facet of motor regulation. The KHC also binds to the kinesin light chain (KLC), which has been implicated in both autoinhibition and activation of the motor. We show that the KLC inhibits the kinesin-microtubule interaction independently from the proposed intramolecular interaction within KHC. Cargo-adaptor proteins that bind the KLC stimulated processive movement, but the landing rate of activated kinesin complexes remained low. Microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7) enhanced motility by increasing the landing rate and run length of the activated kinesin motors. Our results support a model whereby the motor activity of the kinesin is regulated by synergistic inhibition mechanisms and that cargo-adaptor binding to the KLC releases both mechanisms. However, a non-motor MAP is required for robust microtubule association of the activated motor. Thus, human kinesin is regulated by synergistic autoinhibition and activation mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
Antibody-mediated immunity is initiated by B cell differentiation into multiple cell subsets, including plasmablast, memory, and germinal center (GC) cells. B cell differentiation trajectories are determined by transcription factors, yet very few mechanisms that specifically determine early B cell fates have been described. Here, we report a post-transcriptional mechanism that suppresses the plasmablast genetic program and promotes GC B cell fate commitment. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that antigen-specific B cell precursors at the pre-GC stage upregulate YTHDF2, which enhances the decay of methylated transcripts. Ythdf2-deficient B cells exhibit intact proliferation and activation, whereas differentiation into GC B cells is blocked. Mechanistically, B cells require YTHDF2 to attenuate the plasmablast genetic program during GC seeding, and transcripts of key plasmablast-regulating genes are methylated and bound by YTHDF2. Collectively, this study reveals how post-transcriptional suppression of gene expression directs appropriate B cell fate commitment during initiation of the adaptive immune response.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a vital role in maintaining the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Lactate is a crucial metabolite in cancer and is related to tumor prognosis, metastasis, and overall survival. In this study, we focus on the effects of lactate on Treg cells. In vitro, lactate improves Treg cell stability and function, whereas lactate degradation reduces Treg cell induction, increases antitumor immunity, and decreases tumor growth in mice. Mechanistically, lactate modulates Treg cell generation through lactylation of Lys72 in MOESIN, which improves MOESIN interaction with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) receptor I and downstream SMAD3 signaling. Cotreatment with anti-PD-1 and a lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor has a stronger antitumor effect than anti-PD-1 alone. Individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma who responded to anti-PD-1 treatment have lower levels of MOESIN lactylation in Treg cells than nonresponding individuals. Thus, we identify lactate as an essential small molecule that reinforces Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment through lactylation.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for homeostasis in the colon, but the mechanism by which local environmental cues determine the localization of colonic Tregs is unclear. Here, we administer indigo naturalis (IN), a nontoxic phytochemical aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist used for treating patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in Asia, and we show that IN increases Helios+ Tregs and MHC class II+ epithelial cells (ECs) in the colon. Interactions between Tregs and MHC class II+ ECs occur mainly near the crypt bottom in the steady state, whereas Tregs dramatically increase and shift toward the crypt top following IN treatment. Moreover, the number of CD25+ T cells is increased near the surface of ECs in IN-treated UC patients compared with that in patients treated with other therapies. We also highlight additional AhR-signaling mechanisms in intestinal ECs that determine the accumulation and localization of Helios+ Tregs in the colon.

Abstract: Summary
Protein O-GlcNAcylation plays critical roles in many cellular events, and its dysregulation is related to multiple diseases. Integrating bioorthogonal chemistry and multiplexed proteomics, we systematically and site specifically study the distributions and dynamics of protein O-GlcNAcylation in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of human cells. The results demonstrate that O-GlcNAcylated proteins with different functions have distinct distribution patterns. The distributions vary site specifically, indicating that different glycoforms of the same protein may have different distributions. Moreover, we comprehensively analyze the dynamics of O-GlcNAcylated and non-modified proteins in these two compartments, respectively, and the half-lives of glycoproteins in different compartments are markedly different, with the median half-life in the cytoplasm being much longer. In addition, glycoproteins in the nucleus are more dramatically stabilized than those in the cytoplasm under the O-GlcNAcase inhibition. The comprehensive spatial and temporal analyses of protein O-GlcNAcylation provide valuable information and advance our understanding of this important modification.

Abstract: Summary
The evolution of zinc (Zn) as a protein cofactor altered the functional landscape of biology, but dependency on Zn also created an Achilles’ heel, necessitating adaptive mechanisms to ensure Zn availability to proteins. A debated strategy is whether metallochaperones exist to prioritize essential Zn-dependent proteins. Here, we present evidence for a conserved family of putative metal transferases in human and fungi, which interact with Zn-dependent methionine aminopeptidase type I (MetAP1/Map1p/Fma1). Deletion of the putative metal transferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ZNG1; formerly YNR029c) leads to defective Map1p function and a Zn-deficiency growth defect. In vitro, Zng1p can transfer Zn2+ or Co2+ to apo-Map1p, but unlike characterized copper chaperones, transfer is dependent on GTP hydrolysis. Proteomics reveal mis-regulation of the Zap1p transcription factor regulon because of loss of ZNG1 and Map1p activity, suggesting that Zng1p is required to avoid a compounding effect of Map1p dysfunction on survival during Zn limitation.

Abstract: Annual and sporadic influenza outbreaks pose a great threat to human health and the economy worldwide. Moreover, the frequent mutation of influenza viruses caused by antigen drift complicates the application of antiviral therapeutics. As such, there is an urgent need for novel antiviral agents to tackle the problem of insufficient efficacy of licensed drugs. Inspired by the success of the newly emerged PROTACs (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras) strategy, we report herein the design and synthesis of novel PROTAC molecules based on an oseltamivir scaffold to combat severe annual influenza outbreaks. Among these, several compounds showed good anti-H1N1 activity and efficient influenza neuraminidase (NA) degradation activity. The best compound, 8e, effectively induced influenza NA degradation in a dose-dependent manner and relied on the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Moreover, Compound 8e exhibited potent antiviral activity toward both wild-type H1N1 virus and an oseltamivir-resistant strain (H1N1, H274Y). A molecular docking study demonstrated that Compound 8e had good hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with both the active sites of NA and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) proteins, which could effectively drive the favorable interaction of these two proteins. Thus, as the first report of a successful anti-influenza PROTAC, this proof of concept will greatly widen the application range of the PROTAC technique to antiviral drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
The p53 transcription factor drives anti-proliferative gene expression programs in response to diverse stressors, including DNA damage and oncogenic signaling. Here, we seek to uncover new mechanisms through which p53 regulates gene expression using tandem affinity purification/mass spectrometry to identify p53-interacting proteins. This approach identified METTL3, an m6A RNA-methyltransferase complex (MTC) constituent, as a p53 interactor. We find that METTL3 promotes p53 protein stabilization and target gene expression in response to DNA damage and oncogenic signals, by both catalytic activity-dependent and independent mechanisms. METTL3 also enhances p53 tumor suppressor activity in in vivo mouse cancer models and human cancer cells. Notably, METTL3 only promotes tumor suppression in the context of intact p53. Analysis of human cancer genome data further supports the notion that the MTC reinforces p53 function in human cancer. Together, these studies reveal a fundamental role for METTL3 in amplifying p53 signaling in response to cellular stress.

Abstract: Summary
Defects in primary cilia, cellular antennas that control multiple intracellular signaling pathways, underlie several neurodevelopmental disorders, but it remains unknown how cilia control essential steps in human brain formation. Here, we show that cilia are present on the apical surface of radial glial cells in human fetal forebrain. Interfering with cilia signaling in human organoids by mutating the INPP5E gene leads to the formation of ventral telencephalic cell types instead of cortical progenitors and neurons. INPP5E mutant organoids also show increased Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling, and cyclopamine treatment partially rescues this ventralization. In addition, ciliary expression of SMO, GLI2, GPR161, and several intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins is increased. Overall, these findings establish the importance of primary cilia for dorsal and ventral patterning in human corticogenesis, indicate a tissue-specific role of INPP5E as a negative regulator of SHH signaling, and have implications for the emerging roles of cilia in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Severity of pulmonary viral infections, including influenza A virus (IAV), is linked to excessive immunopathology, which impairs lung function. Thus, the same immune responses that limit viral replication can concomitantly cause lung damage that must be countered by largely uncharacterized disease tolerance mechanisms. Here, we show that mitochondrial cyclophilin D (CypD) protects against IAV via disease tolerance. CypD−/− mice are significantly more susceptible to IAV infection despite comparable antiviral immunity. This susceptibility results from damage to the lung epithelial barrier caused by a reduction in interleukin-22 (IL-22)-producing natural killer (NK) cells. Transcriptomic and functional data reveal that CypD−/− NK cells are immature and have altered cellular metabolism and impaired IL-22 production, correlating with dysregulated bone marrow lymphopoiesis. Administration of recombinant IL-22 or transfer of wild-type (WT) NK cells abrogates pulmonary damage and protects CypD−/− mice after IAV infection. Collectively, these results demonstrate a key role for CypD in NK cell-mediated disease tolerance.

Full-fusion and kiss-and-run in chromaffin cells controlled by irreversible vesicle size-dependent fusion pore transitions,

Abstract: Exocytosis operates through two distinct modes. Full-fusion leads to rapid expulsion of the entire content of a vesicle; kiss-and-run leads to slow and partial expulsion. These two modes have important biological consequences for endocrine regulation and synaptic transmission. Amperometry recordings of catecholamine release from chromaffin cells reveal single-vesicle fusion events corresponding to both of these modes, but classification is often difficult. This study introduces a new method of analyzing amperometry data to improve this classification. The ratio of the average amplitude to the peak amplitude differs between full-fusion and kiss-and-run, and the probability distribution of this ratio is well fitted by a double-Gaussian. Kiss-and-run events identified by this method have fusion pores with kinetic properties different from pores associated with full-fusion. They have slower transition rates and lifetime distributions indicative of irreversible transitions. The total-charge of an amperometric spike is expected to scale with vesicle volume during a full-fusion event. The cube root of this quantity should therefore scale with diameter, but the distribution of this quantity differs from the distribution of vesicle diameter seen in the electron microscope. Fusion pore lifetimes associated with full-fusion depend on vesicle size, and this makes the choice of mode size dependent. The fusion pore thus bifurcates after opening, and vesicle size influences this choice. The secretory vesicle protein synaptophysin influences the size dependence of fusion pore lifetime and the choice of release mode. Incorporating vesicle size into an analysis of release mode reconciled the kinetics of fusion pores, as well as the distributions of vesicle diameter and catecholamine content. Thus, the initial fusion pore emerges as a critical focus in endocrine regulation. By modulating the size-dependence of the mode of exocytosis, changes in the molecular makeup of the exocytotic apparatus can impact the shape and size of an amperometric event, and the speed and composition of secretion.

Abstract: Summary
Exercise can prevent osteoporosis and improve immune function, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that exercise promotes reticulocalbin-2 secretion from the bone marrow macrophages to initiate bone marrow fat lipolysis. Given the crucial role of lipolysis in exercise-stimulated osteogenesis and lymphopoiesis, these findings suggest that reticulocalbin-2 is a pivotal regulator of a local adipose-osteogenic/immune axis. Mechanistically, reticulocalbin-2 binds to a functional receptor complex, which is composed of neuronilin-2 and integrin beta-1, to activate a cAMP-PKA signaling pathway that mobilizes bone marrow fat via lipolysis to fuel the differentiation and function of mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells. Notably, the administration of recombinant reticulocalbin-2 in tail-suspended and old mice remarkably decreases bone marrow fat accumulation and promotes osteogenesis and lymphopoiesis. These findings identify reticulocalbin-2 as a novel mechanosensitive lipolytic factor in maintaining energy homeostasis in bone resident cells, and it provides a promising target for skeletal and immune health.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) was previously reported to play important role in the process of stem cell migration and various differentiation behaviors of muscle-derived mesenchymal stem cells (M-MSCs). However, its role and regulatory mechanism in the osteoblast differentiation and calcification of M-MSCs remain unclear. In the current study, we found that MMP2 could facilitate the osteoblast differentiation and calcification of muscle-derived mesenchymal stem cells by up-regulating the expression of some typical osteogenic differentiation phenotype markers, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and osteocalcin (OCN). Besides, we further demonstrated that MMP2 could be directly targeted by miRNA-29b-3p, which was validated by dual luciferase reporter gene and rescue assays. Moreover, increased expression of MMP2 could contribute to forming more calcium nodules representative for osteoblast calcification verified by the alizarin red staining, vice versa. In conclusion, we identified the role of miRNA-29b-3p/MMP2 relationship in regulating osteoblast differentiation and calcification of M-MSCs, which may complement the effect of MMPs family on the osteoblast differentiation to some extent, providing some potential clinical application value in the promotion of bone formation in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Whereas stem and progenitor cells proliferate to maintain tissue homeostasis, fully differentiated cells exit the cell cycle. How cell identity and cell-cycle state are coordinated during differentiation is still poorly understood. The Drosophila testis niche supports germline stem cells and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). CySCs give rise to post-mitotic cyst cells, providing a tractable model to study the links between stem cell identity and proliferation. We show that, while cell-cycle progression is required for CySC self-renewal, the E2f1/Dp transcription factor is dispensable for self-renewal but instead must be silenced by the Drosophila retinoblastoma homolog, Rbf, to permit differentiation. Continued E2f1/Dp activity inhibits the expression of genes important for mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis rescues the differentiation of CySCs with ectopic E2f1/Dp activity but not their cell-cycle exit. In sum, E2f1/Dp coordinates cell-cycle progression with stem cell identity by regulating the metabolic state of CySCs.

Abstract: Summary
Vertebrate evolution was accompanied by two rounds of whole-genome duplication followed by functional divergence in terms of regulatory circuits and gene expression patterns. As a basal and slow-evolving chordate species, amphioxus is an ideal paradigm for exploring the origin and evolution of vertebrates. Single-cell sequencing has been widely used to construct the developmental cell atlas of several representative species of vertebrates (human, mouse, zebrafish, and frog) and tunicates (sea squirts). Here, we perform single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) for different stages of amphioxus (covering embryogenesis and adult tissues). With the datasets generated, we constructed a developmental tree for amphioxus cell fate commitment and lineage specification and characterize the underlying key regulators and genetic regulatory networks. The data are publicly available on the online platform AmphioxusAtlas.

Abstract: Summary
Reduced p62 levels are associated with the induction of the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotype, which promotes tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo through inflammation and metabolic reprogramming. However, how p62 is downregulated in the stroma fibroblasts by tumor cells to drive CAF activation is an unresolved central issue in the field. Here we show that tumor-secreted lactate downregulates p62 transcriptionally through a mechanism involving reduction of the NAD+/NADH ratio, which impairs poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase 1 (PARP-1) activity. PARP-1 inhibition blocks the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the AP-1 transcription factors, c-FOS and c-JUN, which is an obligate step for p62 downregulation. Importantly, restoring p62 levels in CAFs by NAD+ renders CAFs less active. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, mimick lactate in the reduction of stromal p62 levels, as well as the subsequent stromal activation both in vitro and in vivo, which suggests that therapies using olaparib would benefit from strategies aimed at inhibiting CAF activity.

Abstract: Summary
The E1 and E2 envelope proteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV) form a heterodimer that drives virus-host membrane fusion. Here, we analyze the role of each amino acid in E1E2 function, expressing 545 individual alanine mutants of E1E2 in human cells, incorporating them into infectious viral pseudoparticles, and testing them against 37 different monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to ascertain full-length translation, folding, heterodimer assembly, CD81 binding, viral pseudoparticle incorporation, and infectivity. We propose a model describing the role of each critical residue in E1E2 functionality and use it to examine how MAbs neutralize infection by exploiting functionally critical sites of vulnerability on E1E2. Our results suggest that E1E2 is a surprisingly fragile protein complex where even a single alanine mutation at 92% of positions disrupts its function. The amino-acid-level targets identified are highly conserved and functionally critical and can be exploited for improved therapies and vaccines.

We performed a comparative analysis of human and 12 non-human primates to identify sequence variations in known cancer genes. We identified 395 human-specific fixed non-silent substitutions that emerged during evolution of human. Using bioinformatics analyses for functional consequences, we identified a number of substitutions that are predicted to alter protein function; one of these mutations is located at the most evolutionarily conserved domain of human BRCA2.

Abstract: Summary
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) harbors hundreds of species well adapted to its extreme conditions, including its low-oxygen (hypoxic) atmosphere. Here, we show that the plateau pika—a keystone mammal of the QTP—lacks robust circadian rhythms. The major form of the plateau pika Epas1 protein includes a 24-residue insert caused by a point mutation at the 5′ juncture site of Intron14 and is more stable than other mammalian orthologs. Biochemical studies reveal that an Epas1-Bmal1 complex with lower trans-activation activity occupies the E1/E2 motifs at the promoter of the core-clock gene Per2, thus explaining how an Epas1 mutation—selected in the hypoxic conditions of the QTP—disrupts the molecular clockwork. Importantly, experiments with hypoxic chambers show that mice expressing the plateau pika Epas1 ortholog in their suprachiasmatic nucleus have dysregulated central clocks, and pika Epas1 knockin mice reared in hypoxic conditions exhibit dramatically reduced heart damage compared with wild-type animals.

Abstract: Background
Using clinical samples and database analysis, this study aimed to investigate the signaling pathways that mediated degeneration of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) in patients with intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD).
Methods
NPCs were extracted from enucleated intervertebral discs of IDD patients, and the senescence, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis levels of cells were confirmed by β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), Western blot, and measurement of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH). The microarray expression profile of GSE56081 was downloaded to screen differentially expressed mRNAs. CO-IP and ubiquitination assays were used to determine the targeted regulation of XIAP by SIAH1. Methylation of mRNA was verified by m6A RIP and actinomycin D assays.
Results
NPCs extracted from the enucleated intervertebral discs of IDD patients exhibited marked senescence, apoptosis, elevated levels of inflammation, and decreased ECM synthesis. The expression of SIAH1 was significantly elevated in NPCs of IDD patients, and SIAH1 knockdown reversed senescence, apoptosis, elevated levels of inflammation, and decreased ECM synthesis in NPCs of IDD patients. CO-IP and ubiquitination assays indicated that SIAH1 can target and ubiquitinate XIAP. Besides, MeRIP-qPCR and actinomycin experiments showed that METTL3-mediated m6A can methylate SIAH1 mRNA.
Conclusion
In IDD patients, SIAH1 can target and ubiquitinate XIAP, thereby mediating senescence, apoptosis, increased inflammation, and decreased ECM synthesis of NPCs, while METTL3-mediated m6A can methylate SIAH1 mRNA, producing harmful effects.

Abstract: Summary
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in ∼40% of patients with diabetes and causes kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. We analyzed the response of a murine DKD model to five treatment regimens using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Our atlas of ∼1 million cells revealed a heterogeneous response of all kidney cell types both to DKD and its treatment. Both monotherapy and combination therapies targeted differing cell types and induced distinct and non-overlapping transcriptional changes. The early effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on the S1 segment of the proximal tubule suggest that this drug class induces fasting mimicry and hypoxia responses. Diabetes downregulated the spliceosome regulator serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 7 (Srsf7) in proximal tubule that was specifically rescued by SGLT2i. In vitro proximal tubule knockdown of Srsf7 induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype, implicating alternative splicing as a driver of DKD and suggesting SGLT2i regulation of proximal tubule alternative splicing as a potential mechanism of action for this drug class.

Abstract: Summary
Assisted reproductive technology has been widely applied in the treatment of human infertility. However, accumulating evidence indicates that in vitro fertilization (IVF) is associated with a low pregnancy rate, placental defects, and metabolic diseases in offspring. Here, we find that IVF manipulation notably disrupts extraembryonic tissue-specific gene expression, and 334 epiblast (Epi)-specific genes and 24 Epi-specific transcription factors are abnormally expressed in extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) of IVF embryos at embryonic day 7.5. Combined histone modification analysis reveals that aberrant H3K4me3 modification at the Epi active promoters results in increased expression of these genes in ExE. Importantly, we demonstrate that knockdown of the H3K4me3-recruited regulator Kmt2e, which is highly expressed in IVF embryos, greatly improves the development of IVF embryos and reduces abnormal gene expression in ExE. Our study therefore identifies that abnormal H3K4me3 modification in extraembryonic tissue is a major cause of implantation failure and abnormal placental development of IVF embryos.

Abstract: Summary
It is not well understood why diabetic individuals are more prone to develop severe COVID-19. To this, we here established a human kidney organoid model promoting early hallmarks of diabetic kidney disease development. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, diabetic-like kidney organoids exhibited higher viral loads compared with their control counterparts. Genetic deletion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in kidney organoids under control or diabetic-like conditions prevented viral detection. Moreover, cells isolated from kidney biopsies from diabetic patients exhibited altered mitochondrial respiration and enhanced glycolysis, resulting in higher SARS-CoV-2 infections compared with non-diabetic cells. Conversely, the exposure of patient cells to dichloroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor of aerobic glycolysis, resulted in reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our results provide insights into the identification of diabetic-induced metabolic programming in the kidney as a critical event increasing SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility, opening the door to the identification of new interventions in COVID-19 pathogenesis targeting energy metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Physiological blood-tissue barriers play a critical role in separating the circulation from immune-privileged sites and denying access to blood-borne viruses. The mechanism of virus restriction by these barriers is poorly understood. We utilize induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human brain microvascular endothelial cells (iBMECs) to study virus-blood-brain barrier (BBB) interactions. These iPSC-derived cells faithfully recapitulate a striking difference in in vivo neuroinvasion by two alphavirus isolates and are selectively permissive to neurotropic flaviviruses. A model of cocultured iBMECs and astrocytes exhibits high transendothelial electrical resistance and blocks non-neurotropic flaviviruses from getting across the barrier. We find that iBMECs constitutively express an interferon-induced gene, IFITM1, which preferentially restricts the replication of non-neurotropic flaviviruses. Barrier cells from blood-testis and blood-retinal barriers also constitutively express IFITMs that contribute to the viral resistance. Our application of a renewable human iPSC-based model for studying virus-BBB interactions reveals that intrinsic immunity at the barriers contributes to virus exclusion.

Abstract: Summary
Dendrites are essential determinants of the input-output relationship of single neurons, but their role in network computations is not well understood. Here, we use a combination of dendritic patch-clamp recordings and in silico modeling to determine how dendrites of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing basket cells contribute to network oscillations in the gamma frequency band. Simultaneous soma-dendrite recordings from PV basket cells in the dentate gyrus reveal that the slope, or gain, of the dendritic input-output relationship is exceptionally low, thereby reducing the cell’s sensitivity to changes in its input. By simulating gamma oscillations in detailed network models, we demonstrate that the low gain is key to increase spike synchrony in PV basket cell assemblies when cells are driven by spatially and temporally heterogeneous synaptic inputs. These results highlight the role of inhibitory neuron dendrites in synchronized network oscillations.

Abstract: Summary
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic heart disease that is characterized by unexplained segmental hypertrophy that is usually most pronounced in the septum. While sarcomeric gene mutations are often the genetic basis for HCM, the mechanistic origin for the heterogeneous remodeling remains largely unknown. A better understanding of the gene networks driving the cardiomyocyte (CM) hypertrophy is required to improve therapeutic strategies. Patients suffering from HCM often receive a septal myectomy surgery to relieve outflow tract obstruction due to hypertrophy. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on septal myectomy samples from patients with HCM, we identify functional links between genes, transcription factors, and cell size relevant for HCM. The data show the utility of using scRNA-seq on the human hypertrophic heart, highlight CM heterogeneity, and provide a wealth of insights into molecular events involved in HCM that can eventually contribute to the development of enhanced therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the unprecedented success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) as anti-cancer therapy, it remains a prevailing clinical need to identify additional mechanisms underlying ICI therapeutic efficacy and potential drug resistance. Here, using lineage tracking in cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice, we demonstrate that erythroid progenitor cells lose their developmental potential and switch to the myeloid lineage. Single-cell transcriptome analyses reveal that, notwithstanding quantitative differences in erythroid gene expression, erythroid differentiated myeloid cells (EDMCs) are transcriptionally indistinguishable from their myeloid-originated counterparts. EDMCs possess multifaceted machinery to curtail T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. Consequently, EDMC content within tumor tissues is negatively associated with T cell inflammation for the majority of solid cancers; moreover, EDMC enrichment, in accordance with anemia manifestation, is predictive of poor prognosis in various cohorts of patients undergoing ICI therapy. Together, our findings reveal a feedforward mechanism by which tumors exploit anemia-triggered erythropoiesis for myeloid transdifferentiation and immunosuppression.
