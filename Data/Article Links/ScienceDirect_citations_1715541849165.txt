Abstract: A novel 18 amino acid peptide PYC98 was demonstrated to inhibit JNK1 activity toward c-Jun. We observed a 5-fold increase in the potency of the retro-inverso form, D-PYC98 (a d-amino acid peptide in the reversed sequence) when compared with the inhibition achieved by L-PYC98, prompting our further evaluation of the D-PYC98 inhibitory mechanism. In vitro assays revealed that, in addition to the inhibition of c-Jun phosphorylation, D-PYC98 inhibited the JNK1-mediated phosphorylation of an EGFR-derived peptide, the ATF2 transcription factor, and the microtubule-regulatory protein DCX. JNK2 and JNK3 activities toward c-Jun were also inhibited, and surface plasmon resonance analysis confirmed the direct interaction of D-PYC98 and JNK1. Further kinetics analyses revealed the non-ATP competitive mechanism of action of D-PYC98 as a JNK1 inhibitor. The targeting of the JNK1 common docking site by D-PYC98 was confirmed by the competition of binding by TIJIP. However, as mutations of JNK1 R127 and E329 within the common docking domain did not impact on the affinity of the interaction with D-PYC98 measured by surface plasmon resonance analysis, other residues in the common docking site appear to contribute to the JNK1 interaction with D-PYC98. Furthermore, we found that D-PYC98 inhibited the related kinase p38 MAPK, suggesting a broader interest in developing D-PYC98 for possible therapeutic applications. Lastly, in evaluating the efficacy of this peptide to act as a substrate competitive inhibitor in cells, we confirmed that the cell-permeable D-PYC98-TAT inhibited c-Jun Ser63 phosphorylation during hyperosmotic stress. Thus, D-PYC98-TAT is a novel cell-permeable JNK inhibitor.

Abstract: The clinical application of a bioartificial liver (BAL) depends on the availability of a human cell source with high hepatic functionality, such as the human hepatoma cell line HepaRG. This cell line has demonstrated high hepatic functionality, but the effect of BAL culture on its functionality in time is not known. Therefore, we studied the characteristics of the HepaRG-AMC-BAL over time, and compared the functionality of the HepaRG-AMC-BAL with monolayer cultures of HepaRG cells, normalized for protein (bioactive mass) and DNA (cell number). Histological analysis of 14-day-old BALs demonstrated functional heterogeneity similar to that of monolayer cultures. Hepatic functionality of the HepaRG-AMC-BALs increased during 2–3 weeks of culture. The majority of the measured protein-normalized hepatic functions were already higher in day 14 BAL cultures compared to monolayer cultures, including ammonia elimination (3.2-fold), urea production (1.5-fold), conversion of 15N-ammonia into 15N-urea (1.4-fold), and cytochrome P450 3A4 activity (7.9-fold). Lactate production in monolayer cultures switched into lactate consumption in the BAL cultures, a hallmark of primary hepatocytes. When normalized for DNA, only cytochrome P450 3A4 activity was 2.5-fold higher in the BAL cultures compared to monolayer cultures and lactate production switched to consumption, whereas urea production and 15N-urea production were 1.5- to 2-fold lower. The different outcomes for protein and DNA normalized functions probably relate to a smaller cell volume of HepaRG cells when cultured in the AMC-BAL. Cell damage was 4-fold lower in day 14 BAL cultures compared to monolayer cultures. Transcript levels of cytochrome P450 1A2, 2B6, 3A4 and 3A7 genes and of regulatory genes hepatic nuclear factor 4α and pregnane X receptor increased in time in BAL cultures and reached higher levels than in monolayer cultures. Lastly, metabolism of amino acids, particularly the alanine consumption and ornithine production of HepaRG-AMC-BALs more resembled that of primary hepatocytes than monolayer HepaRG cultures. We conclude therefore that BAL culture of HepaRG cells increases its hepatic functionality, particularly when normalized for biomass, both over time, and compared to monolayer, and this is associated with a reduction in cell damage, upregulation of both regulatory and structural hepatic genes, and changes in amino-acid metabolism. These results underline the potential of HepaRG cells for BAL application.

Abstract: In this contribution optical simulations of both flat and textured heterojunction silicon solar cells are presented and verified experimentally. Using Advanced Semiconductor Analysis (ASA) software, we optimize a double-layer anti-reflective (AR) coating, which has an additional SiOx film on the top of the existing indium tin oxide (ITO) coating. Our approach is based on maximizing the absorbance of the crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafer, which is strongly correlated with the solar cell′s short circuit current (Jsc). Our simulations show that for a flat heterojunction silicon solar cell c-Si absorbance can increase by using a double-layer AR coating instead of a single-layer AR coating. As predicted by the simulations, experimental devices show corresponding Jsc increase, leading to the increase of the solar cell efficiency. On a textured heterojunction silicon solar cell the incident light travels an oblique path through the AR coating and we use an advanced ray-tracing model to optimize the single and double-layer AR coating for this case. Our simulations show that for the textured heterojunction silicon solar cell, reflection losses are lower but parasitic absorption losses in the ITO and amorphous silicon layers play a more important role. Using a double-layer AR coating not only reduces reflection losses further, but because a thinner ITO layer can be used it also reduces parasitic absorption losses. Experimentally, our textured heterojunction silicon solar cell with a double-layer AR coating shows that the Jsc (active area) of 40.5mA/cm2 and an efficiency of 19.0%.

Abstract: Here we report on heterojunction PbS quantum dot (QD) solar cells using RF magnetron sputtered CdS as the n-type window layer. These solar cells generate large open circuit voltage compared to previously reported PbS-QD solar cells. Our investigations of this device design show an optimized CdS film thickness of 70nm and an optimized PbS QD diameter of ∼2.7nm, corresponding to a bandgap energy of ∼1.57eV. Under simulated AM1.5G illumination, we attain short circuit current as high as 12mA-cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 0.65V and efficiency as high as 3.3%.

Abstract: Modern nanostructured designs of solar cells improve photovoltaic conversion by better light trapping and collection of photogenerated charges. Illustrative example may be cells composed of radial junctions on semiconductor nanowires. In other cells the structural elements can be nanowires, nanorods or random light trapping structures. The elements have sizes from nm to μm. Inevitably, they exhibit variations of shape, size and properties which influence local photovoltaic conversion. The cells operate as random arrays of microscopic photodiodes connected in parallel with overall performance limited by weak diodes. Microscopic measurements of photoresponse are needed to assess the distribution of the local photodiodes, their connections and influence of weak diodes. We demonstrate the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) with conductive cantilever for study of local (photo)electronic properties of silicon nanostructures: p–i–n radial junctions of amorphous Si grown on Si nanowires or mixed phase microcrystalline films. We have used the conductive AFM to study the local photoresponse of the microcrystalline grains in mixed phase thin films to changes of external illumination. We have observed variations of the conductivity of the radial junction solar cells based on Si nanowires. Finally, we discuss possibilities of comparing the local photoresponse to local photovoltaic conversion efficiency.

Abstract: The DR2518 (RqkA) a eukaryotic type serine/threonine protein kinase in Deinococcus radiodurans was characterized for its role in bacterial response to oxidative stress and DNA damage. The K42A, S162A, T169A and S171A mutation in RqkA differentially affected its kinase activity and functional complementation for γ radiation resistance in Δdr2518 mutant. For example, K42A mutant was completely inactive and showed no complementation while S171A, T169A and T169A/S171A mutants were less active and complemented proportionally to different levels as compared to wild type. Amongst, different DNA binding proteins that purified RqkA could phosphorylate, PprA a DNA repair protein, phosphorylation had improved its affinity to DNA by 4 fold and could enhance its supportive role in intermolecular ligation by T4 DNA ligase. RqkA phosphorylates PprA at threonine 72 (T72), serine 112 (S112) and threonine 144 (T144) in vitro with the majority of it goes to T72 site. Unlike wild type PprA and single mutants of T72, S112 and T144 residues, the T72AS112A double and T72AS112AT144A triple mutant derivatives of PprA did not phosphorylate in vivo and also failed to complement PprA loss in D. radiodurans. Deletion of rqkA in pprA::cat background enhanced radiosensitivity of pprA mutant, which became nearly similar to ΔrqkA resistance to γ radiation. These results suggested that K42 of RqkA is essential for catalytic functions and the kinase activity of RqkA as well as phosphorylation of PprA have roles in γ radiation resistance of D. radiodurans.

Abstract: Senescence bystander effect refers to a phenomenon in which senescent cells elicit the development of senescence phenotype in their nearby young counterparts. In this paper we examined the mechanism of senescence bystander effect triggered by senescent human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) in proliferating HPMCs and peritoneal fibroblasts (HPFBs). The results showed that conditioned medium (CM) derived from senescent HPMCs elicited a senescence response (growth inhibition coupled with increased expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and accumulation of histone γ-H2A.X) in either early-passage HPMCs or HPFBs. Samples of CM from senescent HPMCs contained increased amounts of numerous soluble mediators of which only transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) was able to induce senescence phenotype in the both types of peritoneal cells, likely through an induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). At the same time, senescent HPMCs released increased amounts of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a major activator of TGF-β1. Significantly, TSP-1 itself was unable to induce senescence phenotype in HPMCs or in HPFBs. The experiments employing anti-TSP-1 antibodies and specific TSP-1 blocking peptide revealed that neutralization of TSP-1 in CM prevented TGF-β1-dependent development of senescence phenotype. Collectively, our findings indicate that senescent HPMCs exhibit senescence-promoting activity toward neighboring young cells (HPMCs and HPFBs), and this effect is, at least partly, related to TSP-1-dependent activation and further ROS- and p38 MAPK-related activity of TGF-β1.

Abstract: The intrinsic degradation mechanisms leading to the initial burn-in deterioration in power conversion efficiency in small-molecule-based organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are studied. Specifically, we examine degradation in archetype boron subphthalocyanine chloride/fullerene OPVs in the absence of atmospheric contaminants such as water and oxygen. During the initial burn-in period (<20h), planar OPVs employing C60 as the acceptor exhibits a rapid decrease in efficiency that is primarily due to a reduction in photocurrent contributed by excitons generated in C60, as observed by the changes in the spectrally-resolved external quantum efficiency. We develop an analytical model that ascribes the decrease in power conversion efficiency with aging to an energetically-driven increase in the density of exciton-induced quenching sites that hinder exciton diffusion to the donor–acceptor interface. This mechanism is mitigated by employing a C70 acceptor, or a mixed donor–acceptor active layer where excitons are rapidly dissociated following photogeneration, thereby significantly reducing their lifetime and density.

Abstract: A solar selective absorber coating of CrNxOy/SiO2 was prepared on Cu (Si) substrate using DC reactive magnetron sputtering technique. The coating exhibits a high absorptivity (α) of 0.947 and a low emissivity (ε) of 0.05 at 80°C. The spectral selectivity (α/ε) of the coating on Cu substrate is stable (0.930/0.073) even after heat-treatment at 278°C in air for 300h, but decreased (0.904/0.135) at 278°C for 600h. The determinants to govern the thermal stability were investigated by micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) measurements, which reveal that the element diffusion whether throughout all the stacked layers or near the interface region, the chemical interactions adjacent to the interface, and the interface width broadening are the Achilles' heel for the solar thermal coatings to sustain high thermal stability.

Abstract: We report on recent developments of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) for high-efficiency thin-film silicon solar cells. For a-Si:H, the light absorber layers were grown by a remote plasma technique using a triode electrode configuration in plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Despite the relatively low deposition rate (0.01–0.03nm/s) compared to the conventional diode-type PECVD process (~0.2nm/s), the light-induced degradation in conversion efficiency (Δη/ηini) of single-junction solar cell is substantially reduced (e.g., Δη/ηini~10% at an absorber thickness of 250nm). As a result, we have obtained confirmed stabilized efficiencies of 9.6% and 11.9% for a-Si:H single-junction and a-Si:H/μc-Si:H tandem solar cells, respectively. Meanwhile, for μc-Si:H solar cells, we have investigated the structural properties of the μc-Si:H absorber layers grown at high deposition rates (>2nm/s). Several design criteria for the device grade μc-Si:H are proposed in terms of crystallographic orientation, grain size and grain boundary passivation.

Abstract: Doping wide band gap semiconductors, such as ZnO, with trivalent rare earth (RE) ions is well known to enhance their optical activity. The present paper shows that high quality ZnO:Yb layers can be obtained by RF magnetron sputtering and that an efficient electronic transfer from ZnO to Yb+3 ions can be achieved. It is also shown that the rare earth is optically active at any deposition temperature and that its contribution to the photoluminescence (PL) is important even at very low concentrations. In particular, for samples deposited at low temperatures, the rare earth strongly enhances the photon conversion, yielding a total PL up to three times more intense. On the other hand, if the layers are exposed to temperatures above 200°C, either during deposition or upon post-deposition annealing, the presence of Yb quenches the total PL. Thermal annealing of the films at 700°C under Ar or O2 gas flow highly improves the PL of both ZnO and ZnO:Yb.

Abstract: Films of titanium oxynitride are assessed for their potential as energy saving coatings on window glass. The coatings are deposited from the atmospheric pressure chemical vapour reaction of TiCl4 and ammonia. Film microstructure and composition was analysed using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, pulsed RF GD OES and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Transmission and reflectance spectroscopy were used to investigate the optical properties of the films. In this study optical data is used in building simulations to predict the savings made by these novel thin films compared to standard products, for locations with different climates. The results suggest that such glazing can have a significant energy saving effect compared to current approaches across a wide range of climate types.

Abstract: High-injection mobility reduction is examined by theory, modeling, and experimental data acquired by resonance-coupled photoconductive decay (RCPCD). The ambipolar mobility is shown to reduce to zero when the constituent injection-dependent carrier mobilities are taken into account. Modeling of the photoconductivity incorporating the transient, injection-dependent, ambipolar mobility confirms experimental reduction in signal at increasing carrier-generation rates. The onset of the reduction of mobility occurs at approximately 10 times the background carrier density; thus devices that utilize lightly doped materials are susceptible to anomalous injection-based behavior. For photovoltaic applications, high-injection device-performance degradation would result from mobility reduction due to reduced diffusion length.

Abstract: In this paper, we report a recent progress in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells and mini-modules demonstrated on soda-lime glass (SLG) substrates, which are one of the most common and cost effective substrate materials for chalcopyrite photovoltaics. CIGS absorber layers grown by the three-stage co-evaporation process was used with an optimized [Se]/[metal] flux ratio and preferable substrate temperatures for SLG substrate thicknesses. SLG substrates of 0.28–1.1mm in thickness, which are thinner than that generally used in laboratories and industries (∼2–3mm), were employed to develop techniques for further reductions of material cost and module weight. Solar cell and mini-module efficiencies of >19% and >17%, respectively, with relatively high open circuit voltages (Voc) and fill factors (FF) (Voc 0.77V and FF 0.79 for cells, and Voc 0.77V and FF 0.74 for mini-modules) were demonstrated using a composition ratio [Ga]/([In]+[Ga]) of 0.45 for the CIGS absorber layers. Key techniques and future directions toward highly efficient CIGS solar cells and modules with high values of Voc and FF are discussed.

Abstract: We report on transparent stand alone C60 top electrodes for small molecule based organic photovoltaic cells. All device layers (including bottom and top electrode) are thermally evaporated in vacuum, guaranteeing fast, reliable, high-purity and low-cost processing. Employing an organic compound as electrode avoids refractive index mismatch between contact and photo-active layer which results in an increased number of photons reaching the absorber layers. The conductivity of C60 is improved from 10−8S/cm to remarkable 4.97S/cm by optimized molecular n-type doping. Furthermore, it is shown that high doping concentrations change the absorption behavior of C60, leading to transmittance values over 70% for wavelengths larger than 600nm with a weak dependence on layer thickness. Organic solar cells employing such an optimized n-doped C60 top electrode (thickness 200nm, doping concentration 16wt%) exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 1.53%. Electrical device simulations based on a discretized equivalent circuit model reveal an efficient lateral charge transport in n-doped C60 electrodes over a few 100µm. In combination with a supporting grid electrode (usually employed for large area photovoltaic applications), n-doped C60 might replace ITO and fill the lack of transparent conductive top electrodes required for roll-to-roll processed semi-transparent organic devices or devices on opaque substrates.

Abstract: Bulk heterojunction solar cells made by vacuum co-evaporation of polythiophene (PTh) and fullerene (C60) are reported and the blend morphology control through donor–acceptor composition and post-situ annealing demonstrated. Co-deposited heterojunctions are shown to generate about 60% higher photocurrents than their thickness-optimized PTh/C60 planar heterojunction counterparts. Furthermore, by annealing the devices post-situ the power conversion efficiency is improved by as much as 80%. UV–vis, XRD and AFM analysis shows that the enhanced photoresponse is a result of favorable morphological development of PTh upon annealing. Annealing-induced improvement of the donor–acceptor network is demonstrated across a wide range of compositions (20–80% PTh). This illustrates that good morphology control is possible in co-evaporated polymer–fullerene blends through multiple parameters and differentiates this donor–acceptor combination from the standard small-molecule systems.

The decrease in the power efficiency is shown to be related to two processes: degradation of the optical absorption and charge transport in the active layer. The decrease of the absorption can be further accelerated upon light exposure. Rigid encapsulation tackles efficiently the degradation process under both climates. Devices fabricated in air yield almost similar performances that those fabricated in N2, confirming that the fabrication process can be carried out in simple environmental conditions. This supports the development of low-cost sustainable photovoltaic technologies in countries with limited economic resources but abundant solar radiation.

Abstract: Diabetes-associated lymphocyte dysfunction may be attributed to the direct effect of hyperglycemia, but the impact of glucose concentration on B cell functionality is not fully resolved. Since, adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) and its metabolite adenosine are the core constituents of the purinergic signaling network involved in regulation of immune response we aimed to investigate the impact of high glucose concentration on ATP outflow and metabolism on B cell surface. Purified human peripheral blood B cells cultured at high glucose (25mM) concentration released significantly less ATP (~60%) comparing to cells cultured in low glucose (5mM) concentration. We observed that high glucose altered ATP hydrolysis on B cell surface due to increased activity of nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (NTPDase-1/CD39). In the presence of 10μM [3H]AMP and 100μM ATP significant quantities of [3H]ADP and [3H]ATP were generated, although the AMP to ADP phosphorylation potential of B cells cultured in high glucose decreased significantly. The flow cytometry analysis revealed that the level of ecto-adenylate kinase 1β (AK1β) on surface of B cells cultured in high glucose decreased significantly. Inhibition of NTPDase1/CD39 activity with 100μM ARL67156 resulted in decreased cell viability, although significantly more viable cells retained in the culture media containing low glucose compared to high glucose media. Selective inhibition of P2X7 purinergic receptor irrespective of glucose concentration completely protected B cells against the ARL 67156-induced cell death. We assume that high glucose-induced alteration of ATP handling on B cell surface might contribute to impaired functionality of B cells in diabetes.

Abstract: SiCH thin films grown from Ar/tetramethylsilane plasmas (PECVD) were evaluated as absorber layers in selective coatings for high-temperature solar receivers. SiCH coatings are used in thermomechanical applications because of their good thermal stability. A SiCH film with an absorption index k(430nm)=0.11 was taken as a reference for optical simulations of refractory metal–SiCH multilayer stacks and cermets. The transfer matrix method and Maxwell–Garnett effective medium approximation were used to calculate the spectral reflectance and transmittance of the selective absorbers. Their solar absorptance and thermal emittance were also deduced. A seven-layer stack with alternating metal and SiCH layers was found to present a simulated solar absorptance of 0.92 and thermal emittance of 0.08 at 500°C.

Abstract: We have investigated light trapping of p–i–n type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) single-junction and p–i–n–p–i–n type a-Si:H/hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) double-junction solar cells by adopting the oxygen-content graded or the oxygen-content alternated hydrogenated n-type silicon oxide (SiOx:H) reflectors. The graded n-type SiOx:H back reflector effectively increases the optical path length of the p–i–n type a-Si:H single-junction solar cells due to the refractive index grading. Moreover, the alternated n-type SiOx:H back reflector comprising of highly hydrogen-diluted n-type a-Si:H (n-a-Si:H) sublayers having a high refractive index and highly hydrogen-diluted n-type a-SiOx:H sublayers having a low refractive index provides the further improvement for the optical path length of the p–i–n type a-Si:H single-junction solar cells due to the multiple reflection. Furthermore, the developed alternated n-type SiOx:H reflector is suitable for the back reflector as well as the intermediate reflector of the p–i–n–p–i–n type a-Si:H/μc-Si:H double-junction solar cells. As a result, the high initial efficiency (η) of 13.1% and stabilized η of 11.5% are achieved. The considerably thin (30–45nm) alternated n-type SiOx:H reflectors can be easily prepared using the in situ plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. Since the alternated n-type SiOx:H reflector can avoid the lateral shunting problem during the monolithic series integration of segments, it is a promising option for cost effective mass production of large-area thin-film silicon solar modules.

Abstract: Two solar cells based on an InGaN/GaN p–i–n hetero-junction, but having different dislocation densities, were fabricated and characterized. The structures were grown on c-plane (0001) GaN-on-sapphire templates with different threading dislocation (TD) densities of 5×108 and 5×109cm−2. Structural characterization revealed the presence of V-defects in the InGaN epilayer. Since each V-defect was associated with a TD, the structural as well as the optical properties worsened with a higher TD density in the GaN/sapphire template. It was also found that additional dislocations were generated in the p-GaN layer over the V-defects in the InGaN layer. Because of its superior structural quality, the peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the low TD density sample was three times higher than that of the high TD density sample.

Abstract: InGaN/GaN multiple-quantum-well solar cells were grown on (111) Si substrates. AlN/AlGaN superlattice and self-assembly SixNy masking islands were employed to alleviate the material mismatches between Si and GaN. The devices were characterized under the illumination of AM 1.5G with different solar concentrations. As the concentration ratios increased from 1-sun to 105-sun, energy conversion efficiency was enhanced by 25%, which was noticeably greater than the enhancement reported on sapphire substrates under similar solar concentrations. The result is attributed to the superior heat sinking of Si substrates.

Abstract: In this paper, a quasi-ordered bulk hetertojunction of P3HT/PCBM solar cells (Q-O BHJ device) was fabricated by zone-casting from the solutions with different aging times. P3HT nanofibers aligned in an oriented manner due to the shear stress and solute concentration gradient during zone-casting process. The orientation degree of P3HT nanofibers increased when the aging time of solution was prolonged. Meanwhile, P3HT had a high crystallinity due to the slow evaporation rate of solvent during the film-forming process. The oriented alignment of nanofibers could facilitate the connection between nanofibers by increasing the bridging chains. Furthermore, the bridging chains tended to adopt an untwisted conformation, which results in a reduced energy barrier of hole transfer. As a consequence, the Q-O BHJ device had a higher fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) compared with the device fabricated by spin coating (BHJ device), leading to an increase by almost more than 50% in device efficiency and a PCE of 3.26% without any annealing treatment.

Abstract: Dye-sensitised solar cell (DSSC) technology has seen some radical advancement recently owing to the new materials and device structure innovations. The efficiency increase in the solid state version of DSSCs from about 5% to over 15% have been reported within two years of time scale, which comes mainly from the efforts in the perovskites based mesoporous solar cells developments. This has increased its potential significantly to become a low cost alternative for commercially available solar cell technologies. The progress of the liquid junction based DSSCs towards their better performance and stability had been relatively slower and was coupled with scale up and engineering challenges such as encapsulation, sealing of the device, etc. The efficiency figures for conventional DSSCs had been staying stagnant for almost two decades although many research groups had been concentrating to improve the efficiency of DSSC through various ways. The recent developments on the solid state DSSCs have given a solid belief for this technology to make a mark towards its commercialisation. Although a great progress in the device efficiency has been made but a lot of efforts are still needed to break the barriers which had been preventing this from penetrating the market. An attempt has been made through this article to report the recent developments in the liquid junction, quasi and solid state versions of the DSSC technology with their state of the art efficiency figures reflecting their current status.

Abstract: This paper presents new advances on an atmospheric-based deposition process for Cu(In,Ga)Se2 synthesis, consisting of the electrodeposition of a Cu–In–Ga mixed oxide/hydroxide layer from an aqueous solution, at room temperature, followed by a thermochemical reduction and selenization. This process enables the one-step co-deposition of the three elements, from a simple aqueous electrolyte containing nitrate ions as oxygen precursor, with fast growing rates and precise control of composition. The reduction process is carried out thermally in pure hydrogen atmosphere and leads to Cu–In–Ga metallic alloys. After selenization, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 phase was obtained and completed solar devices reach a 12.4% maximal power conversion efficiency.

Abstract: We report the results of a study of the sulphurization time effects on Cu2ZnSnS4 absorbers and thin film solar cells prepared from dc-sputtered stacked metallic precursors. Three different time intervals, 10min, 30min and 60min, at maximum sulphurization temperature were considered. The effects of this parameter' change were studied both on the absorber layer properties and on the final solar cell performance. The composition, structure, morphology and thicknesses of the CZTS layers were analyzed. The electrical characterization of the absorber layer was carried out by measuring the transversal electrical resistance of the samples as a function of temperature. This study shows an increase of the conductivity activation energy from 10meV to 54meV for increasing sulphurization time from 10min to 60min. The solar cells were built with the following structure: SLG/Mo/CZTS/CdS/i-ZnO/ZnO:Al/Ni:Al grid. Several ac response equivalent circuit models were tested to fit impedance measurements. The best results were used to extract the device series and shunt resistances and capacitances. Absorber layer's electronic properties were also determined using the Mott–Schottky method. The results show a decrease of the average acceptor doping density and built-in voltage, from 2.0×1017cm−3 to 6.5×1015cm−3 and from 0.71V to 0.51V, respectively, with increasing sulphurization time. These results also show an increase of the depletion region width from approximately 90nm–250nm.

Abstract: The mechanisms that limit the performance of a solar cell can be often identified by an assessment of the solar cell's local ideality factor m. Typically, m is extracted from the current–voltage curve of a completed solar cell and plotted as a function of voltage. In this study, m is extracted from photoluminescence measurements of the effective carrier lifetime and plotted against the excess carrier concentration Δn or the implied open-circuit voltage Voci. It is shown that a plot of m(Δn) or m(Voci) is a powerful way to analyse recombination processes within a silicon wafer, where its main advantage is that it can be determined from wafers that have neither metal contacts nor a p–n junction. With an m(Δn) plot, one can readily identify a range of Δn (or voltage) that is dominated by a single recombination mechanism, or that constitutes a transition from one dominant mechanism to another. One can also identify the dominating recombination mechanisms at a cell's maximum power point. In this paper we demonstrate the application of extracting an m(Δn) curve, and we show how it is affected by Shockley–Read–Hall and Auger recombination in the bulk, and by fixed charge in a dielectric coating.

Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) radial junction solar cells, built over a dense matrix of Si nanowires (SiNWs), benefit from strong light trapping. This allows the use of a very thin absorber layer without sacrificing the solar cell performance, while improving its stability. By optimizing the density of SiNWs grown via a plasma-assisted vapor–liquid–solid process on glass, we have achieved radial junction a-Si:H solar cells with an open circuit voltage of 0.80V, short circuit current density of 16.1mA/cm2 and a high power conversion efficiency of 8.14%. Furthermore, we present experimental evidence of the excellent stability of such radial junction a-Si:H solar cells with a light-induced degradation of only ~6%, compared to the typical degradation of 15% to 20% in planar cells. These results indicate the feasible and promising approach towards a new generation of stable and high performance a-Si:H thin film solar cells.

Abstract: The long-term (up to 100 days) stabilities of thin films of a trimethine cyanine dye (Cy3-P) and of Cy3-P/C60 bilayer solar cells with initial power conversion efficiencies of up to 3.6% in the regular and inverted device architecture were studied. For storage conditions under nitrogen at room temperature in the dark, Cy3-P films were stable and no decrease in performance was measured for inverted ITO/TiO2/C60/Cy3-P/MoO3/Ag solar cells. ITO/PEDOT:PSS and aluminum were found to be responsible for a slight inherent degradation of regular solar cells under inert storage conditions. Solar cells stressed at accelerated (80°C) full sun simulation showed a burn-in period of ~5 days with a performance loss of 75%. This initial performance decrease might be linked to the photopolymerization reaction of C60. For longer times, performances stabilized and arrived at 15% of the initial values after a test period of 17 days.

Abstract: Using hydrofluoric acid (HF) to improve the contact resistance of a screen-printed silicon solar cell with a high sheet resistance emitter was found to concurrently reduce its pseudo-fill factor. By treating the cell in phosphoric acid, this impact was found to be significantly reduced or eliminated. In the solar cell presented in this work, the pseudo-fill factor reduced from 82.1% to 79.9% after treating the cell in HF, but increased to 81.8% after a subsequent phosphoric acid treatment. Similar effects were found in three other screen-printed solar cells that were fired at different peak furnace temperatures and belt speeds. It was also shown that the phosphoric acid treatment alone does not affect the pseudo-fill factor of a cell. HF treatment can now be used to reduce the contact resistance of a screen-printed silicon solar cell with a high sheet resistance emitter without suffering from a lower pseudo-fill factor so that the full benefit of a HF treatment on a screen-printed silicon solar cell can be realized. This combination of HF and phosphoric acid treatments can potentially be a useful failure analysis method for screen-printed silicon solar cells in the production line and the laboratory.

Abstract: Temperature-dependent current voltage measurements on a CuInSe2 (CIS) solar cell are described and analyzed in detail. At relatively low temperatures, the device is shown to exhibit operation as a phototransistor, evidenced by light flux dependent current in the first quadrant of the current/voltage curve prior to the onset of a high differential resistance region of the curve. The phototransistor behavior is not restricted to light with short wavelengths (such as would stimulate the front contact materials—CdS and ZnO), and has a similar sensitivity to light over a wide range of intensities. Other aspects of the device operation are analyzed including observation of a photoconductive shunt and series differential resistance component, neither of which requires short wavelength light to be observable, a non-light-sensitive diode reverse-saturation current, and characterization of the back diode in the device. It is argued that the presence of an effective back diode also requires a bias voltage to develop across that diode under a variety of operating conditions that could reduce the open circuit voltage of the device. The potential for characterization of minority carrier properties in the device absorber layer through further controlled study of phototransistor behavior in the devices is noted.

Abstract: Glioma is the most common highly malignant primary brain tumor. The molecular pathways that result in the pathogenesis of glioma remain elusive. In this study, we found microRNA-107 (miR-107) was downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Our results revealed miR-107 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation in glioma cells, whereas miR-107 knockdown promoted cell growth in MO59K. miR-107 expression induced apoptosis in glioma cells possibly through the increase in Fas (TNFRSF6)-associated via death domain (FADD) expression and activation of caspases-8 and -3/7. Moreover, the activity of caspase-8 in miR-107-overexpressing SHG44 cells was suppressed with FADD knockdown. The tumor growth in nude mice bearing miR-107-overexpressing SHG44 cells was blocked through apoptosis induction. Sal-like 4 (Drosophila) (SALL4) level was reduced upon miR-107 overexpression in glioma cells, and the inverse was observed upon miR-107 knockdown in MO59K. Using a luciferase reporter system, SALL4 3′-UTR-dependent luciferase activity was reduced by miR-107 mimics or increased by an inhibitor of miR-107. In SHG44, SALL4 downregulation triggered growth inhibition and activated FADD-mediated cell apoptosis pathway. The caspase-8 activity in miR-107-overexpressing SHG44 cells was suppressed with SALL4 upregulation. Furthermore, primary glioma tumors with low miR-107 expression show elevated SALL4 level. An obvious inverse correlation was observed between miR-107 expression and SALL4 level in clinical glioma samples. Therefore, our results demonstrate upregulation of miR-107 suppressed glioma cell growth through direct targeting of SALL4, leading to the activation of FADD/caspase-8/caspase-3/7 signaling pathway of cell apoptosis. These data suggest miR-107 is a potential therapeutic target against glioma.

Abstract: We recently found that both annexin A7 and integrin β4 were involved in autophagy of vascular endothelial cells. But, their relation is not clear. In this study, we addressed this question by using a small molecule ABO that promoted autophagy by targeting annexin A7. The results showed that knockdown of integrin β4 partly inhibited ABO-induced autophagy in vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, in HEK293 cells that express integrin β4 too low to detect by western blot, ABO could not induce autophagy. If integrin β4 was overexpressed in HEK293 cells, ABO could evoke autophagy. On the other hand, knockdown of annexin A7 also blocked ABO-induced autophagy although the level of integrin β4 was elevated. Moreover, by co-immunoprecipitation, we identified the interaction of integrin β4 and annexin A7, and found that ABO could modulate the interaction, at the same time, the phosphorylation of Y-1494 in integrin β4 cytoplasmic domain was inhibited significantly in vitro and in vivo. Hence, by identifying the interaction between integrin β4 and annexin A7, we demonstrated that both annexin A7 and integrin β4 were essential for small molecule ABO-induced autophagy and targeting annexin A7 by ABO could modulate integrin β4 phosphorylation, while Y-1494 phosphorylation of integrin β4 may negatively regulate autophagy.

Abstract: Nb-doped TiO2 in pure anatase form prepared by spray drying exhibits enhanced photoelectrochemical performance both in its bare form (under UV irradiation) and when used as an electron collector in TiO2-polyheptazine hybrid photoanodes for water photooxidation under visible (λ>420nm) light. The optimum Nb-doping concentration was 0.1at%, and the enhancement of photocurrents was found to be chiefly due to enhanced mobility of electrons in Nb-doped TiO2. Accordingly, the beneficial effect of Nb doping on photocurrent generation in hybrid photoanodes was pronounced particularly at longer irradiation wavelengths and lower bias potentials.

Abstract: In recent years, organic solar cells have become the most potential technologies of the photovoltaic devices. In selection of the hole transport layer (HTL) in the inverted structure of organic solar cells, the use of molybdenum oxide (MoO3) has attracted more attention. However, the deposition of thermal evaporation in HTL fabrication requires highly vacuumed process, so it reduces the advantages in organic solar cells of large-area manufacture and low cost. Therefore, the solution process in MoO3 has been investigated. In this work, we dissolved MoO3 in isopropyl alcohol (IPA), spin-coated it on active layer Poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4–b]thiophene))-2,6-diyl]): [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester acid methyl ester (PBDTTT-C:PC71BM) as the anode modification layer in the inverted structure, and then modified further by air plasma before Ag(silver) electrodes were deposited. As a result, controlling the conditions of treating time, pressure and power of plasma, the efficiency of device with MoO3 solution process is improved from 2.50% to 4.65% under the plasma conditions 1.5Torr/18.0W/1min.

Abstract: Metals are an integral part of solar cell structures—as a metal contact and/or a back reflector. However it is a less known fact that there are plasmonic losses associated with these structures and it is important to minimise such losses especially when placed in proximity to scattering media like textures on the front of the cell that can introduce an angular dependence to the light incident on the rear. This study investigates the losses in a metal reflector when placed adjacent to a dielectric layer in a typical solar cell rear geometry. The experimental measurement was realised using a novel custom built optical setup for characterising intensity of the reflected light at various internal incident angles at the Si–dielectric interface. Our results show that the thickness of the dielectric layer, the refractive index of the dielectric layer and the type of the rear metal can all affect the degree of such losses and the distribution of the angular reflection. Both measured and simulation results indicate that a 250–320nm SiO2 along with an Ag back reflector gives the best internal rear angular reflection in Si but is dependant on the wavelength of interest. It also shows that textured or scattering front interfaces with internal incident angles greater than 28° have the potential to provide light trapping through total internal reflection and at the same time minimise plasmonic losses at the metal reflector interface.

Abstract: Nickel oxide (NiO) thin films prepared by cathodic electrodeposition exhibit superior electrical performace than PEDOT:PSS when used as anode interlayers of bulk-heterojunction solar cells. Devices incorporating 30nm-thick NiO films firstly annealed at 320°C in air and posteriorly treated with UV-O3 reach power conversion efficiencies comparable to that obtained for PEDOT:PSS-based cells. NiO interlayers enhance contact selectivity by simulataneously increasing shunt resistance (lower leakage current related to electron-blocking ability), and reducing hole-extraction resistance. Carrier selectivity is quantified from the resistance components associated with the impedance response of the anode contacts. The versatile electrodeposition technique of NiO interlayers permits avoiding PEDOT:PSS use as it presents disadvantages related to its acid character and hygroscopic nature.

Abstract: 2,2′,7,7′-Tetra(9,9-diethyl-9H-fluorene)-9,9′-bifluorenylidene (TFBF) was synthesized as a non-fullerene type electron acceptor for bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells. The TFBF was synthesized from 2,7-di(9,9-diethyl-9H-fluorene)-9H-fluoren-9-one by a reductive dimerization using Lawesson's reagent. The TFBF was soluble in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The synthesis of TFBF was identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FAB-Mass, and FT-IR, and the properties of the molecule were characterized by UV–visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The ionization potential of the TFBF solid thin film was determined by photo-electron spectroscopy, and morphology of the active layer was investigated by atomic force microscope. The measured optical band gap, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of TFBF were 2.32, −5.81, and −3.49eV, respectively. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of P3HT solution in chloroform were measured at different TFBF concentration. The PL intensity of P3HT solution was decreased by increasing the TFBF concentration. The electron mobility of P3HT:TFBF blend film was measured to be 6.82×10−5cm2/Vs at the electric field of 500 (V/cm)1/2. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:TFBF/LiF/Al. One of the fabricated device showed the highest Voc of 0.70V with Jsc=1.20mA/cm2, FF=0.30, and PCE=0.26% at donor to acceptor composition ratio of 1:0.4.

Abstract: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs)-based therapies have been increasingly recognized as a potential tool to replace or support cells and their function damaged by the neurodegenerative process that underlies Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, we implanted engineered mouse embryonic stem (ES) CGR8 cells, which stably co-express glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), into striatum (Str) or both Str and substantia nigra (SN) of parkinsonian rats lesioned by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). We found that cell transplantation into Str or both Str and SN rescued behavioral abnormalities and striatal DA depletion associated with 6-OHDA lesion. Our findings suggested that the profound functional impairment in nigrostriatal circuitry could be at least partially restored by ESCs-based expression of TH and GDNF, which may be developed into a useful tool for PD therapy.

Abstract: The S component (LukS-PV) is one of the two components of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), which is a pore-forming cytotoxin secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, with the ability to lyse leukocytes. In this study, LukS-PV had the ability to induce apoptosis in the human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line THP-1. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms of LukS-PV-induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells treated with LukS-PV, resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and induced G0/G1 arrest associated with an inhibition of cell cycle arrest regulatory protein (cyclin D1) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as measured by flow cytometry (FCM). After 12h exposure to LukS-PV (1.00μM), annexin V-EGFP/propidium iodide (PI) FCM revealed that 19.5±3.6% of THP-1 cells were apoptotic, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining also revealed THP-1 cells were apoptotic. Chip analysis of 84 apoptosis-related genes demonstrated that 9 genes were up-regulated at least 2-fold and that 5 genes were down-regulated at least 2-fold in the treatment group when compared with levels in the control group. Western blotting reveled that the expression of caspase-8 increased significantly (approximately 4-fold). The levels of caspase-9, -3 and Bax increased significantly, and levels of Bcl-2 decreased rapidly with LukS-PV treatment. These data suggest that LukS-PV acts as an anti-leukemia agent and activates AML cell apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, LukS-PV may be a multi-targeting drug candidate for the prevention and therapy of AML.

Abstract: A soluble pentacene diketone (PDK) photoprecursor, 6,13-dihydro-6,13-ethanopentacene-15,16-dione, was used with C60 to fabricate hetero-layered organic photovoltaic devices. The PDK spin-coated film converts to an insoluble pentacene film upon photoirradiation. The photoconversion process strongly depends on the solvent used for spin-coating. A mixture of chloroform and dichlorobenzene (ratio 1:5) gave the best photovoltaic device performance. The absorbed photon-to-current efficiency in the photo-converted-pentacenefilm device was similar to that of the vacuum-deposited pentacene film.

Abstract: As a typical thermochromic material, the vanadium dioxide (VO2) has a great potential for building energy efficiency development. In this study, the VO2 glazing's application performance was first demonstrated in full-size, and simulated with a software of high credibility. For a 2.9m×1.8m×1.8m low-mass room whose window's size is 1.65m×1.65m, the measured results showed that the room with the VO2 glazing saved 10.2–19.9% cumulative cooling load than that with an ordinary glazing during the demonstration. The application performance to a conventional residential room in the hot summer and warm winter zone was simulated in BuildingEnergy, a simulation software developed by the authors. The simulated results showed that the use of the VO2 glazing could save ∼9.4% electricity consumption. The effects of the window's orientation and the area ratio of window to wall were also discussed in this study.

Abstract: In this work, form-stable phase change materials (FSPCMs) comprising paraffin as latent heat storage material and styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene triblock copolymer (SEBS) as supporting material were prepared, and their shape stability was studied systematically by rheological analysis for a deep understanding of shape stability mechanism. The mass percentage of paraffin can reach 90wt% without any obvious leakage of paraffin above its melting point, suggesting excellent energy storage capacity. The results of rheological measurement reveal that the shape stability of these composites derives from the formation of SEBS–paraffin reversible physical gel, which can prevent the free flowage of melted paraffin, while the failure to keep their apparent shapes stable at a further higher temperature may be ascribed to hard gel–soft gel and gel–fluid transitions. In addition, thermal properties and thermal stability of the composites were also investigated. This study proposed a universal method to detect the variation of materials with temperature and deeply understand the physical mechanism of shape stability, which not only accelerates the pace for practical application of existing FSPCMs, but also provides foundational insight for the design of new FSPCMs. Considering the proposed analysis method is applicable for most FSPCMs, this work may build up bridges for both comprehensive academic research and industrial application of FSPCMs.

Abstract: In present study, we investigated the effect of ginsenoside Rg3 on hepatitis B virus DNA replication and secretion of hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen in HepG2.2.15 cells. Rg3 dose- and time-dependently inhibited hepatitis B surface antigen, e antigen, and hepatitis B viral particle secretion. To explore the effect of Rg3 on anti-hepatitis B activity, we analysed toll-like receptor–myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 signalling. Rg3 did not affect the expression of toll-like receptors or myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88. However, it significantly inhibited the expression of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1, which are adaptor molecules that signal through a toll-like receptor–myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88-dependent pathway. The inhibitory effect of Rg3 on TNF receptor-associated factor 6/transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1 expression was caused by the downregulation of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 expression as well as the stimulation of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TNF receptor-associated factor 6, followed by downregulation of transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1. Furthermore, Rg3 inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling by inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, reduced the expression of AP-1 transcription factors (especially c-Jun and JunB), and inhibited AP-1 promoter activity. The inhibitory effect of Rg3 on c-Jun N-terminal kinase/AP-1 signalling showed anti-inflammatory activity based on the reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 and TNF-α, at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Therefore, Rg3 showed anti-hepatitis B activity via the degradation of TNF receptor-associated factor 6/transforming growth factor β activated kinase-1 and the inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/AP-1 signalling.

Abstract: We report on the light-induced degradation kinetics of hydrogenated polymorphous silicon (pm-Si:H) solar cells having either substrate or superstrate device configuration. Both types of devices were exposed to light-soaking for 500h. While pm-Si:H superstrate solar cells showed strong degradation (up to 60%) under mercury vapor lamp illumination, we have found that substrate structures are remarkably stable. The difference between the two types of devices is shown to be related to interface delamination which only occurs in superstrate devices. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between short-circuit current density decrease upon light-soaking and solar cell area loss.

Abstract: One of the critical fabrication processes of silicon wafer solar cells is the emitter formation. Tube based diffusion, using phosphorus oxychloride as the dopant source, is the standard in the photovoltaic industry. Inline-diffusion, using phosphoric acid as a dopant source, is a potentially low-cost alternative; however it typically results in lower solar cell efficiency. This paper presents an improved etch-back process, ‘SERIS etch’, for inline-diffused emitters, which achieves batch average efficiency of 18.6% using 156mm pseudo-square industrial-grade p-type Cz mono-silicon wafers with conventional screen-printed metallisation and aluminium back surface field (Al-BSF). The best cell is 18.7% efficient, with an open-circuit voltage of 631mV and a fill factor of 80.6%. These high efficiencies were achieved by co-optimisation of the emitter dopant profile and the emitter etch-back process. A variety of characterisation techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, effective lifetime measurement, dopant profile analyser, photo- and electroluminescence images, and current–voltage (dark and illuminated) measurements were employed in this work.

Abstract: Ribbon Growth on Substrate (RGS) silicon wafers are casted directly from the silicon melt onto reusable substrates. Material losses by wafer sawing are omitted and high production speeds can be achieved. However, multicrystalline RGS silicon as it is produced today incorporates high densities of crystal defects and impurities limiting the efficiency of the corresponding solar cells. The local impact of crystal defects on material quality is estimated via models developed by Donolato and Micard et al.. By theoretically negating the impact of grain boundaries and dislocations, charge carrier diffusion lengths are still limited to values <100µm. In addition to crystal defects which are common in other multicrystalline silicon materials, we found current collecting structures within grain boundaries. These structures can be associated with carbon and oxygen precipitation and are the cause for shunting phenomena. We conclude that high impurity concentrations are the dominant factor for limiting the performance of RGS silicon solar cells.

Abstract: A simple one-step chemical bath process was developed to fabricate Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films. Effects of pH value and ZnCl2 precursor content on the formation of CZTS were investigated. The best process parameters were a pH value of 3.5–4 and a ZnCl2 content of 1.75mmoL for deposition of high quality of CZTS films. The films consist of kesterite phase CZTS nanocrystals and exhibit a band-gap of ∼1.48eV. A conversion efficiency of 0.30% was achieved in one of the CZTS thin film solar cells. The route developed here may provide an alternative approach to produce low-cost and large area solar cells.

Strong evidence for the isolated nano-sized silicon (nc-Si) grains embedded in the a-Si:H matrix is provided. The vertically regular distribution of the nc-Si grains is concluded as the main reason for the fast light-induced metastability with the low degradation for the fabricated pc-Si:H multilayer solar cell by localizing the photocreation of dangling bonds near the defective grain-boundary layers.

Abstract: P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) has been shown to mediate an anticancer effect via apoptosis in different types of cancer. However, whether P2X7R exerts a promoting or suppressive effect on brain glioma is still a controversial issue and its underlying mechanism remains unknown. We showed here that P2X7R suppression exerted a pro-growth effect on glioma through directly promoting cells proliferation and pro-angiogenesis, which was associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. The P2X7R was markedly downregulated by cells exposure to the P2X7R antagonist, brilliant blue G (BBG), moreover, the cells proliferation was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner and the expression of EGFR or p-EGFR protein was significantly upregulated. By constructing C6 cells with reduced expression of P2X7R using shRNA, we also demonstrated strong upregulation in cells proliferation and EGFR/p-EGFR expression. However, this effect of BBG was reversed in the presence of gefitinib or suramin. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography perfusion showed that the BBG or P2X7R shRNA promoted the tumor growth by about 40% and 50%, respectively, and significantly increased angiogenesis. Nissl and Ki-67 staining also confirmed that BBG or P2X7R shRNA notably increased the tumor growth. More importantly, either BBG or P2X7R shRNA could markedly upregulated the expression of EGFR, p-EGFR, HIF-1α and VEGF in glioma cells. In conclusion, P2X7R suppression exerts a promoting effect on glioma growth, which is likely to be related to upregulated EGFR, HIF-1α and VEGF expression. These findings provide important clues to the molecular basis of anticancer effect of targeting purinergic receptors.

Abstract: One-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs) with the structure of (WO3/LiF)N are employed to simultaneously improve the efficiency and transmittance of low bandgap semitransparent polymer solar cells(PSCs). Within the photonic bandgap(PBG) of 580–780nm, 1DPCs with 8 pairs of WO3/LiF act as distributed reflectors (DBR), which reflects light wavelength of 580–780nm back into the PSCs for reabsorption by active layers. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.46% is obtained for the semitransparent PSCs and there is an improvement of 28.1% in the PCE when compared with that of the device without 1DPCs. Within the photonic passband of 380–580nm, the 1DPCs act as antireflection coatings. An average transmittance of 40% is remained within the wavelength range and the value is improved by 33% when compared with that of the device without the 1DPCs. Finally, it is demonstrated that the efficiency and transmittance of the device are dependent on the number of the repeated period (N).

Abstract: Polyethylene (PE) mesh is shown to strongly suppress convective gain at night and to have a high black body transmittance, making it suited to use in radiative cooling. Advantages over previous non-porous cover systems include; self-supporting for large areas, good mechanical stability, low cost, retractable, and a long outdoor lifetime. This study compares performance with a PE mesh cover to that of an impermeable PE cover and to no cover. Convective suppression and net cooling for different wind speeds and ambient temperatures are examined. The impact of such a mesh on night sky cooling rates for a mesh over water, then over a roof is presented. For the roof the associated rise in surface temperature is also measured and modelled in the daytime. Effective permeabilities are not the same as geometric permeability. They are extracted by comparing simulation results with data and are found to depend only weakly on wind speed. They are most sensitive to magnitude and sign of the difference between roof and ambient temperatures. They differ significantly between night and day, that is for convective warming and cooling respectively.

Abstract: The anodic monomer 1,3,5-tris(2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)methyl)benzene, CzE3B, was electropolymerized on the surface of an ITO coated glass. The optical and electrochemical properties of the poly-CzE3B film were investigated by UV/VIS/NIR spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Electrochromic characteristics of the polymer film were examined in continuously cyclic scans between colorlessness and dark green. The poly-CzE3B film functioned as an anodic coloring counter electrode in the electrochromic window and intensified coloration of the window throughout the visible region. The electrochromic window based on poly-3,3-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno [3,4–b][1,4] dioxepine (PProDOT-Me2) and poly-CzE3B films exhibited a high electrochromic contrast. The large-sized electrochromic window was successfully fabricated. It exhibited optical and electrochemical cyclic stability. Also, the color-switching time of the window was investigated.

Abstract: Bio-based PCMs are a type of organic fatty acid ester PCMs made from natural resources, such as soy beans and palm oils. Bio-based PCMs are capable of absorbing, storing, and releasing large amounts of latent heat, similar to conventional paraffin-based PCMs. Compared to the paraffinic PCMs, Bio-based PCMs are significantly less flammable. Also they have a major drawback, namely the low thermal conductivity like as the other PCMs. To improve the thermal conductivity of Bio-based PCMs, xGnP (Exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets) can be an effective enhancement. Therefore we prepared form stable Bio-based PCMs with xGnP, by using the vacuum impregnation method. In this study, we used one of the Bio-based PCMs, which contained soybean oils, coconut oils, and beef tallow. And it has a latent heat capacity of 149.2J/g and melting point of 29.38°C. The Bio-based PCM was incorporated into the porous structure of xGnP. The characteristics of the Bio-based composite PCM were determined by using SEM, DSC, FTIR, TGA and TCi.

Abstract: Background
Thyroid cancer is the second most common malignancy among females at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH&RC) and in Saudi Arabia, accounting for about 11% of all newly diagnosed female cancers in the country in 2008. Over the past several decades, an increasing incidence of thyroid cancer has been reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There are no comprehensive clinical epidemiological data for the trends of thyroid cancer incidence compared to the global incidence. This report reviews the thyroid cancer incidence in KFSH&RC and compares that with Saudi Arabia, the Gulf region, North America and globally from 2000 to 2010.
Methods
Retrospective review of patients with thyroid cancer was carried out from 2000 to 2010, using the hospital Tumor Registry program as per the American College of Surgeons standards. Trends and patterns of all well-known prognostic factors were sub-stratified by age, stage and grade.
Results
A total of 2292 patients with thyroid cancer were treated at KFSH&RC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from 2000 to 2010. Thyroid cancer constitutes about 9% of all malignancies and 12% of all female malignancies at KFSH&RC, which are significantly higher compared to the USA, where thyroid cancer represents only 2.9% of all malignancies and 4.6% of all female malignancies. Papillary adenocarcinoma was the most common histological subtype followed by papillary carcinoma, follicular variant. Median age at diagnosis was 40 for females and 44years for males. Overall Age-Standardized Incidence Rate (ASR) was 4.4/100,000 (6.8 for female and 2/100,000 for males) in the Kingdom in 2008. Median age at diagnosis was 38years and the highest incidence was in the 30–39year age group in KFSH&RC. About 48% of patients presented in the localized stage and 60% underwent combined modality treatment consisting of surgery, radiation and hormonal therapy. There was significantly increased incidence among females as compared to males. The age-adjusted thyroid cancer incidence rates from 2000 to 2010 varied three-fold more for females than for males. Considerable geographical variations were present in thyroid cancer incidence in Saudi Arabia.
Conclusion
Thyroid cancer incidence rates have increased exponentially between 2000 and 2010 and there is significant geographical variation in the incidence of thyroid cancer throughout the Kingdom. Thyroid cancer has become the second most common cancer among young Saudi women with a male to female ratio at 0.3:1. Rising incidence of thyroid cancer in Saudi Arabia may be due to the increased detection and diagnosis of the thyroid cancers and not only an increase in the true occurrence of thyroid cancer. More studies are required to determine this significant difference at the molecular level.

Abstract: Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is one of the most used anode materials in organic solar cells. ITO is a brittle material, however, in roll-to-roll manufacturing plants and final applications material flexibility is beneficial. This study examines the flexibility limits of ITO in applications manufacturing photovoltaic cells. First, ITO was bent using different cylinders to achieve different sample bending curvatures and thus different stages of breaking. Next, the conductivity of ITO was measured and surface topology was profiled. As a result, it was discovered that samples start to break even with low bending curvatures, and while no changes are detected in the surface profile, conductivity starts to decrease. When the cracks start to appear on the surface of ITO, a specific radius of curvature is discernible. In this critical bending curvature resistance and its relative standard deviation start to increase faster. Optical profilometer examination revealed that the cracks reach the ITO surface at the same moment. After this critical bending curvature, clear positive correlation was observed between the conductivity and the number of cracks. To test the effect of cracked ITO on the performance of solar cells, solar cells were produced on top of the cracked ITO layer. The measurements showed that cracks did not decrease the performance of solar cell. This fact supports the use of ITO-based organic photovoltaic cells in applications where flexibility is required as well as in roll-to-roll manufacturing.

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between growth factors and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) signaling remains a crucial issue to optimize the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and BMPs in bone tissue engineering. BMP9 is highly capable of promoting osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is abundantly secreted during the healing process of fractures or in surgery bone sites. Herein, we explore the detail effect of FGF2 on BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. It was found that FGF2 inhibited BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation by blocking BMP9-induced Smads signaling and subsequently reducing Smads dependent up-regulation of ALK1 and ALK2 in MSCs. This effect was rescued by exogenous expression of ALK1 and ALK2, which are proved to be receptors for BMP9. Our results discovered a clue to explain the mechanism involved in the inhibitory effect of FGF2 on BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. This crosstalk between FGF2 and BMP9 should be emphasized in the future use of BMP9 in therapeutic purpose of fracture repair.

Abstract: A Zn(O,S)/ZnO double buffer layer deposited using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) system and boron-doped ZnO window layer deposited using a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system were applied to Cd-free Cu(In,Ga)Se2(CIGS) thin film solar cells. The bandgap energy of the Zn(O,S) buffer layer was varied from 2.8 to 3.6eV by controlling the H2S/(H2O+H2S) pulse ratio. The solar cells with sulfur (S)-poor buffer layers showed a low open-circuit voltage (VOC) owing to the cliff nature of the conduction band offset (CBO) while in contrast, the solar cells with S-rich buffer layers showed a low short-circuit current density (JSC) owing to the spike nature of CBO. The CBO was optimized to a value of 0.36eV which is a moderate “spike”, when Zn(O,S)(Eg=3.11eV) was deposited at a pulse ratio of 0.27. The CIGS thin film solar cells with the optimized Zn(O,S) buffer layer showed a conversion efficiency of 18.3% after heat-light soaking at a temperature of 130°C under AM1.5, 100mW/cm2 illumination.

Abstract: The performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs), based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), were improved by adding poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′](dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2,6-diyl] (PBDTTT-C). The absorption region of the ternary blend films is extended into near infrared region (NIR). Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the ternary blend PSCs is improved to 2.48% with 6% PBDTTT-C, which is 27% higher than the binary blend PSCs. The dominant mechanism for the PCE improvement could be attributed to the well balance between photon harvest and charge carrier transport by doping proper concentration PBDTTT-C. The energy transfer or charge carrier transfer directly between P3HT and PBDTTT-C was investigated, which are found to be positive for the performance improvement of ternary blend PSCs.

Abstract: The mechanism through which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection causes retinal disease and the loss of vision in AIDS patients remains unknown. The HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat (HIV-1 Tat) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and is often described as pleiotropic at different concentrations. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the HIV-1 Tat protein can disrupt the barrier function of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) at 100nM without affecting cell viability. The present study was undertaken to determine if HIV-1 Tat can induce RPE cell death at different concentrations and to determine the mechanism of any observed cell death. The results demonstrated that two RPE cell lines (ARPE-19 and D407) treated with Tat at concentrations of 200nM and above exhibited reduced growth and apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The disruption of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation, the activation of caspase-3/7 and 9, the downregulation of Bcl-2, the upregulation of Bax, and the activation of p38 MAPK, ERK and NF-κB were all observed in HIV-1 Tat-treated RPE cells. When exposed to an inhibitor or transfected with siRNA of p38 MAPK and NF-κB, the level of cell death and deregulation of the expression of the apoptotic protein were attenuated. These effects were not observed with an ERK inhibitor or siRNA. Based on these results, we suggest that the induction of apoptosis by HIV-1 Tat in RPE cells may be mediated by p38 MAPK and NF-κB activation and involve the mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, these pathways may provide clues leading to novel therapeutic approaches for the retinopathy induced by HIV infection.

Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes an epithelial anion channel. Morbidity is mainly due to lung disease, which is characterized by chronic neutrophilic inflammation. Deregulation of inflammatory pathways is observed in the airways of CF patients, as evidenced by exaggerated NF-κB activity, causing an increase in the local release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8. COMMD1, a pleiotropic protein, was recently shown to interact with CFTR and to promote CFTR cell surface expression. The effect of COMMD1 on the NF-κB pathway was assessed in CF and non-CF bronchial epithelial cells by knockdown and overexpression experiments. Results showed that (i) COMMD1 knockdown induced NF-κB-dependent transcription, (ii) COMMD1 overexpression inhibited NF-κB activity and was associated with a decrease in IL-8 transcript level and protein secretion. These data demonstrate the anti-inflammatory properties of COMMD1 in bronchial epithelial cells and open new therapeutic avenues in CF.

Abstract: In the traditional organic solar cell architecture, indium tin oxide (ITO) serves as the transparent electrode and substrate for solution-cast device layers. Hydrophobic contaminants are known to modify ITO wettability and other properties, making selection of an effective cleaning scheme essential. In this work, we demonstrate that certain solvent-based routines provide essentially equivalent surface properties as coupled solvent+UV-ozone protocols reported in literature. Surface energy analysis further reveals that solvent selection can effectively tune ITO charge transport. Fabricated devices showed comparable performance, indicating that interfacial resistances are not limiting factors in the model OSC system and that UV-ozone exposure could be eliminated to reduce commercialization costs.

Abstract: We introduce a novel degradation effect of the transparent conductive oxide zinc oxide (ZnO). The effect is observed for ZnO layers deposited on commercially available soda-lime glass. When an electric field is applied, the potential induced anodic degradation causes a massive sheet resistance increase of the ZnO. We show that the increase in resistance strongly affects the power output of a small non-encapsulated thin-film photovoltaic module, in which ZnO was used as the front electrode. For the module, an amorphous silicon top and a microcrystalline silicon bottom cell were used in the tandem configuration. We found that the evolution of gaseous oxygen at the anode (ZnO) might be responsible for the increased resistance of the ZnO. A model that describes our observation is presented and solutions to suppress the effect are proposed.

Abstract: The loss of epithelial barrier function plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, with levels of 5-lipoxygenase metabolites being increased in the mucosa of these patients. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of the eicosanoids produced by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, leukotriene B4 and D4, and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid on epithelial barrier function. Paracellular permeability was estimated from fluorescein isothiocyanate–dextran fluxes and transepithelial electrical resistance in differentiated Caco-2 cells. Our results suggest that leukotriene D4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid altered both parameters. Identification of the receptors involved in these changes indicated that cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor 1 participates in the effects of leukotriene D4. For both eicosanoids, these effects were mediated by activation of the phospholipase C/Ca2+/protein kinase C pathway, in addition to cAMP-independent protein kinase A activation. Furthermore, we observed a correlation between increased paracellular permeability and the redistribution of occludin, and for leukotriene D4, the disorganization of the subapical actin ring and myosin light chain kinase activation. In conclusion, on the basis of our results, we propose that 5-lipoxygenase pathway metabolites participate in the disruption of epithelial barrier function that is characteristic of inflammatory bowel disease.

Age-related CXC chemokine receptor-4-deficiency impairs osteogenic differentiation potency of mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stromal stem cells,

Abstract: Cysteine (C)-X-C chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) is the primary transmembrane receptor for stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). We previously reported in mouse or human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal stem cells (BMSCs) that deleting or antagonizing CXCR4 inhibits bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2)-induced osteogenic differentiation. The goal of this study was to determine whether CXCR4-deficiency in BMSCs is an age-related effect in association with impaired osteogenic differentiation potency of aged BMSCs. Using BMSCs derived from C57BL/6J wild type mice at ages ranging from 3 to 23 months old, we detected decreased CXCR4 mRNA and protein expression as well as SDF-1 secretion with advancing aging. Moreover, CXCR4-deficient BMSCs from elderly vs. young mice exhibited impaired osteogenic differentiation in response to BMP2 stimulation or when cultured in dexamethasone (Dex)-containing osteogenic medium, evidenced by decreased alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin synthesis, and calcium deposition (markers for immature and mature osteoblasts). Mechanistically, impaired BMP2- or Dex-osteoinduction in BMSCs of elderly mice was mediated by inhibited phosphorylation of intracellular R-Smads and Erk1/2 or Erk1/2 and p38 proteins, and decreased Runx2 and Osx expression (osteogenesis “master” regulators) were also detected. Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated repair of CXCR4 expression in BMSCs of elderly mice restored their osteogenic differentiation potentials to both BMP2 treatment and osteogenic medium. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that CXCR4 expression in mouse BMSCs declines with aging, and this CXCR4-deficiency impairs osteogenic differentiation potency of aged BMSCs. These findings provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying age-related changes in BMSC-osteogenesis, and will potentiate CXCR4 as a therapeutic target to improve BMSC-based bone repair and regeneration in broad orthopedic situations.

Abstract: This work provides the state-of-the-art of dye solar cell chemical stability, assessed through accelerated ageing at temperatures up to 95°C and shows that solvent-based dye solar cells (DSCs) can pass 1000h/85°C tests with less than 10% loss of performance. Prior work is reviewed and compared with recent in-house results from DSCs based on three different solvents and two representative Ru dyes as well as the organic dye Y123. An “industrial DSC toolbox” of analysis methods, including IV testing at various light levels and in the dark, IPCE, EIS (at a single or at multiple cell voltages) and post mortem analysis, is used to better understand degradation mechanisms. For highly stable Z907-based cells, loss of performance due to high temperature ageing is dominated by loss of Voc, rather than Jsc or ff. Based on literature and this work, loss of I3−, resulting in partial bleaching of the electrolyte, appears to be strongly correlated with loss of performance upon high temperature storage, with the most stable systems investigated in this work displaying only marginal bleaching at temperatures above 80°C. Two in situ methods, EIS under light at zero DC current and IPCE in the sub 450nm region were used to quantitatively or semi-quantitatively gauge electrolyte I2 concentration within the active area. The nature of I3− degradation products still remains unknown. A lower limit of 68kJ/mol was estimated for the activation energy of the rate determining step, which leads to increased dark currents and thus lowered Voc upon high temperature storage. In addition there is evidence from IPCE of some changes to the dye structure, especially in MPN and GBL-based electrolyte systems. Dye desorption and degradation of platinum catalytic activity was shown to occur to some degree at the highest temperatures, but the impact on cell performance from these two mechanisms upon high temperature stress testing is only minor. Y123 showed particularly good stability at elevated temperature, surpassing even Z907 in terms of durability. Further improved device seals may lead to continued improvement of DSC stability under the harshest environmental conditions even for materials with a better performance-to-cost ratio than Z907 or Y123.

Abstract: For low cost high efficiency fully plated NiCu contacts on silicon solar cells, a thermal formation of nickel silicide is commonly performed for adhesion promotion. Since the results of this strategy have been found to be ambiguous, and as the interface situation is not understood, a microstructural analysis of the metal–silicon interface after thermal annealing of plated nickel layers on silicon solar cells has been carried out. The point of failure upon performing solder and peel testing on sintered contacts has been identified to be at the silicide–nickel interface. Microstructural analysis shows that void formation can be observed at this interface. The mechanisms of silicide and void formation from plated layers on solar cells are studied taking into account different electrolytes and pretreatments. The cavities can be removed by selective nickel etching and replating nickel onto the formed silicide after silicide pretreatment. Excellent adhesion of up to 2.5N/mm has been measured, which represents the force of silicon wafer breakage rather than true metal adhesive force.

Abstract: Intermediate band solar cells can potentially have an efficiency of ~63% under full solar concentration, but the material systems investigated until now are far from optimum and are fraught with growth related issues such as low quantum dot densities, presence of wetting layers, and strain driven dislocations. Also, incorporation of type-I quantum dots increases carrier recombination rates, resulting in inferior performance. Here, we show that a novel material system with stacked type-II ZnTe-rich submonolayer QDs embedded in ZnCdSe has close to the optimal material parameters required for an intermediate band material system. We have grown structures comprising of as many as 150 layers of QDs that are formed without wetting layers and that have a valence band offset of ~0.8eV relative to the host with a bandgap of ~2.1eV. We demonstrate the possibility of intermediate band formation and subsequent absorption of below bandgap photons. Additionally, these structures are expected to have longer radiative lifetimes and to suppress Auger recombinations owing to their type-II nature.

Abstract: The paper deals with concentrator photovoltaic dense-arrays under non-uniform solar irradiance. For given measured I–V characteristic of InGaP/GaAs/Ge multi-junction solar cells, estimated cell parameters connected to bypass diodes were obtained by using the Newton–Raphson method. Based on the cell parameters, the I–V characteristics of arrays were constructed and their performances under non-uniform irradiance were investigated. With the arrays performances analysis, the function of bypass diodes was also analyzed. Under non-uniform irradiance, the photo-generated currents of the cells are different and as a result, the I–V characteristic of the array contains steps. The steps may indicate the mismatched cells in the array operating in the negative voltage range and forcing the bypass diodes to conduct. For low dispersion of the non-uniformity of the solar flux, the inclusion of bypass diodes has no effect on the output power of the array; however for high dispersion, the output power decreases because the mismatched cells become reverse biased and dissipate power.

Abstract: Computer modelling has become increasingly important in the design and optimization of surface textures that are used in thin-film solar cells to manipulate scattering of light. Light scattering at rough interfaces together with efficient back reflector is a standard approach to enhance absorption of light in the absorber layers of thin-film silicon solar cells. Substrates with randomly textured surface are commonly used to introduce rough interfaces into solar cells. Scalar scattering theory was used to describe light scattering at random nano-textured interfaces and to optimize random texture in single junction solar cells. Recently, substrates with periodic surface features have been investigated as an alternative to randomly surface-textured substrates. Three-dimensional Maxwell equation solvers were used to analyse and optimize such periodic textures when embedded in single and multi-junction solar cells. In both random and periodic cases, opto-electrical modelling was employed to assess the spectral response, to evaluate optical losses and to simulate current density–voltage characteristic.

Abstract: We report on the electrical and optical properties of ZnO/Ag/MoO3 (ZAM) multilayer electrodes deposited directly on glass substrates by a combination of radio frequency (RF) and direct current (DC) sputtering for bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs). Compared to indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes showing 20Ω/sq, the transparent composite electrodes (TCE) in this study exhibited very low sheet resistance of 5Ω/sq without post annealing. In addition, as a hole transport layer, the MoO3 performed with a higher fill factor than PEDOT:PSS due to lower series resistance, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 2.3%, Voc of 0.59V, and Jsc of 9mA/cm2. The power conversion efficiency of the OSC with the ZAM electrode is lower than that of organic solar cells on ITO which has 3.3% efficiency, due to lower transmittance after MoO3 layer deposition. However, our results do support the possibility of using MoO3 as both Ag protecting and hole transport layers for indium-less and PEDOT:PSS-less bulk-heterojunction OSCs.

Abstract: Ceramides with different N-acyl chains can act as second messengers in various signaling pathways. They are involved in cell processes such as apoptosis, differentiation and inflammation. Ceramide synthases (CerS) are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of ceramides and dihydroceramides. Six isoenzymes (CerS1–6) catalyze the N-acylation of the sphingoid bases, albeit with strictly acyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) chain length specificity. We analyzed the mRNA expression, the protein expression, the specific activity of the CerS, and acyl-CoA, dihydroceramide and ceramide levels in different tissues by LC–MS/MS. Our data indicate that each tissue express a distinct composition of CerS, whereby the CerS mRNA expression levels do not correlate with the respective protein expression levels in the tissues. Furthermore, we found a highly significant negative correlation between the protein expression level of CerS6 and the C16:0-acyl-CoA amounts as well as between the protein expression of CerS2 and C24:0-acyl-CoA amounts. These data indicate that in mouse tissues low substrate availability is compensated by higher CerS protein expression level and vice versa. Apart from the expression level and the specific activity of the CerS, other enzymes of the sphingolipid pathway also influence the composition of ceramides with distinct chain lengths in each cell. Acyl-CoA availability seems to be less important for ceramide composition and might be compensated for by CerS expression/activity.

Abstract: The paper presents a review of major features of the crystalline silicon on glass (CSG) technology, its achievements, limitations and challenges, and latest developments. CSG cells are fabricated by solid-state crystallisation (SPC) of 1.5–3.5µm thick precursor diodes prepared by PECVD or ebeam evaporation followed by thermal annealing, hydrogen passivation and metallisation. The highest efficiency of 10.4% was demonstrated on a PECVD minimodule on textured borosilicate glass. The best performing ebeam-evaporated cells on planar glass reached 8.6% efficiency. CSG cells were also produced on low-cost soda-lime glass with 8.1% and 7.1% efficiencies on PECVD and ebeam material respectively. The performance of SPC CSG cells is limited to below 11% because high defect density in SPC material limits VOC and 1.5–3.5µm cell thickness limits JSC. A breakthrough came about when thicker poly-Si films with low defect density on glass were prepared by liquid-phase crystallisation (Amkreutz, 2011) leading to development of the next generation, liquid-phase crystallised silicon on glass (LPCSG) solar cells. The best performing LPCSG cells are made by line-focus laser crystallisation of 10µm thick ebeam silicon films on dielectric layer coated borosilicate glass. High material quality is confirmed by low defect density observed in TEM images, high carrier mobilities, and minority carrier lifetime longer than 260ns. An intermediate dielectric layer can be SiCx, SiOx, SiNx or their combination and its properties are crucial for cell fabrication and performance. Dopants are introduced into the LPCSG cell absorber either during film deposition or diffused from doped intermediate layer during crystallisation. Light-trapping texture is formed on the exposed silicon surface by wet etching. A cell emitter is created by diffusion from spin-on-dopant source. Cell metallisation is based on point contacts between Al and cell emitter and absorber accessed through vias etched through cell layers to different depths. LPCSG cells outperformed CSG cells, with record VOC of 585mV and efficiency of 11.7%. Efficiencies above 13% are achievable by improving light-coupling and contacting.

Abstract: Nucleating agents of polypropylene (PP) have a function in accelerating the crystallization rate, decreasing the spherulite size and transforming the crystal form. Materials with high solar reflectance are widely used in the field for cooling purpose. In this work, three types of nucleating agents were applied to improve the optical properties: malonic acid, sorbitol, and carboxylate nucleating agent (NTC). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement was conducted to investigate the crystallization behavior. Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was used to study the crystal structure and the crystal form. Polarized optical morphology (POM) was chosen to observe the crystal morphology. UV–vis-NIR spectrometer was performed to record the solar reflectance from 280 to 2500nm. It was found that nucleating agents could increase the crystallinity, decrease the spherulie size and transform the crystal form of PP, which in turn improved the solar reflectance considerably. Especially, β crystal form with high birefringence exhibited more excellent solar reflectance in comparison with neat PP, PP/malonic acid and PP/sorbitol. The order of solar reflectance is as follow: spherulites of β crystal form>small spherulites of α crystal form>large spherulites of α crystal form>disordered polymeric chain. All these types of PP have high thermal emittance more than 0.85, 1wt% NTC even improves this value of PP to 0.90.

Abstract: Low-cost upgraded metallurgical grade silicon (UMG-Si) with inherent boron (B) and phosphorus (P) compensation is a novel material for photovoltaic application. In this study, we demonstrate the negative impact of the light-induced degradation (LID) on the efficiency of p-type UMG-Si solar cells. By a following illumination at elevated temperatures, the LID effect in the compensated silicon solar cells can be fully deactivated, and the minority carrier diffusion length is recovered to the original level. The conversion efficiency of the compensated silicon solar cells is increased by a value of more than 3% absolutely compared to the degraded state and is quite stable under the following illumination at room temperature. It is shown that both the boron–oxygen defect density and deactivation energy mainly depend on the total boron concentration rather than the net doping concentration, which strongly suggests that boron is directly involved in the generation and deactivation of boron–oxygen defect at the solar cell level. These results are of significance for understanding the LID effect of the solar cells based on low cost UMG-Si.

Abstract: Several lines of evidence suggest that specific transcriptional events are involved in cell cycle, proliferation and differentiation processes; however, their deregulation by proto-oncogenes are involved in the development of leukemia and tumors. One such proto-oncogene is ecotropic viral integration site I which can differentially effect cell cycle progression and proliferation, in cell types of different origin. Our data for the first time shows that ecotropic viral integration site I binds to ΔNp63 promoter element directly and down regulates its expression. Down regulation of ΔNp63 induces the expression of p21 in HT-29 cells and also in colon carcinoma cells that do not express p53 including patient samples expressing low level of p53, that eventually delay cell cycle progression at G0/G1 phase. Concomitant silencing of ecotropic viral integration site I from the cells or introduction of ΔNp63 to the cells significantly rescued this phenotype, indicating the growth defect induced by ΔNp63 deficiency to be, at least in part, attributable to ecotropic viral integration site I function. The mutual regulation between ecotropic viral integration site I and ΔNp63 may constitute a novel axis which might affect the downstream pathways in cells that do not express functional p53.

Abstract: Oxidative and immune attacks from the environment or microglia have been implicated in the loss of dopaminergic neurons of Parkinson's disease. The role of IgG which is an important immunologic molecule in the process of Parkinson's disease has been unclear. Evidence suggests that IgG can be produced by neurons in addition to its traditionally recognized source B lymphocytes, but its function in neurons is poorly understood. In this study, extensive expression of neuron-derived IgG was demonstrated in dopaminergic neurons of human and rat mesencephalon. With an in vitro Parkinson's disease model, we found that neuron-derived IgG can improve the survival and reduce apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons induced by 6-hydroxydopamine toxicity, and also depress the release of NO from microglia triggered by 6-hydroxydopamine. Expression of TNF-α and IL-10 in microglia was elevated to protective levels by neuron-derived IgG at a physiologic level via the FcγR I and TLR4 pathways and microglial activation could be attenuated by IgG blocking. All these data suggested that neuron-derived IgG may exert a self-protective function by activating microglia properly, and IgG may be involved in maintaining immunity homeostasis in the central nervous system and serve as an active factor under pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: A comprehensive study of zinc oxide (ZnO) film thickness and morphology on the electronic properties of inverted cells is reported. The complete conversion of zinc acetate precursor to 3–5nm particles of ZnO with no residual acetate is obtained after 10min at 300°C. The work-function determined by Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) was 4.3eV. and is independent of the thickness of the ZnO layer or with the planarization of the ITO surface topology. However, the efficiency varies from 0.6% to 1.7% as the ZnO thickness varies from 17nm to 28nm (assuming full density for the ZnO layer) in a laminated device, with both the shunt and series resistance showing a strong variation with ZnO thickness. A relatively thick, mixed phase ZnO/bulk hetero-junction in which the bulk hetero-junction penetrates into the porous ZnO layer is proposed to explain the observed performance trends.

Abstract: A series of solution-processed small molecular solar cells (SMSCs) were fabricated with 2,4-bis[4-(N,N-diisobutylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl] (DIB-SQ) and [6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the active layer. The cells with MoO3 as anode interfacial layer and LiF as cathode interfacial layer have the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) 2.68%, with short circuit density (Jsc) of 8.2mA/cm2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.9V and fill factor (FF) of 36.3% under 100mW/cm2 illumination intensity. The key parameters, including Jsc Voc, and FF of cells with MoO3 as anode interfacial layer and LiF as cathode interfacial layer, are improved about 54.7%, 26.9%, and 23.5% compared with these of cells using PEDOT:PSS as anode interfacial layer and LiF as cathode interfacial layer. The underlying reasons are mainly attributed to the effect of MoO3 layer on charge carrier collection and morphology of active layer. The effect of illumination intensity on the performance of cells was also discussed in detailed.

Abstract: Water vapor ingress significantly impacts the performance and the long-term reliability of copper indium gallium selenide photovoltaic modules. A cost effective packaging method that can protect photovoltaic modules from the operating environment is critical to their widespread commercialization. Due to the sensitivity of both the copper indium gallium selenide cells and the electrodes to water vapor, they need an encapsulant with low water vapor permeation as well as side sealing materials, resulting in a high cost of manufacturing. Hence, a packaging strategy without sealing materials is proposed with new encapsulant materials. In this study, the overall amount of permeated water vapor through ionomer and polyvinyl butyral encapsulants was investigated and compared with widely used encapsulants such as ethylene vinyl acetate. The diffusion and solubility coefficients were calculated from the experimentally determined water vapor transmission rate in both transient and steady state transport regimes. To understand the permeation mechanism of water vapor through the encapsulant, the temperature dependence of the diffusion and solubility coefficients was investigated. Based on experimentally determined permeation properties, the amount of water vapor absorption and the ingress speed into the PV module under a continuously varying environment were investigated. Ethylene vinyl acetate shows its excellence among encapsulants, when simply considering ingress speed of water vapor (slower permeation), while ionomer dominantly outperforms other materials, when focusing on the total amount of water absorption (less permeation).

Abstract: Phosphorus ink technology has been demonstrated as a simple and cheap method to realize selective emitter (SE) crystalline silicon solar cells through mass production in a professional photovoltaic company. We have achieved an average conversion efficiency (η) of 19.01% with peak η of 19.27% for the SE solar cells based on commercial-grade p-type silicon substrate, much higher than that of the homogeneous emitter counterparts whose average η is 18.56%. The standard deviation of the performance for these SE solar cells is also smaller, indicating better repeatability of the phosphorus ink SE technology. Moreover, the SE silicon solar cells can well adapt to various Ag pastes while preserving high cell performance, which offers an opportunity to choose a cheap Ag paste as front metallization material. With the aid of PC1D, we have shown that the η of the SE solar cells can be further improved as the sheet resistance in the illuminated area increases from the present value of 70 to 120Ω/□.

Abstract: We investigated the effect of tungsten oxide (WO3) interlayer as a hole collection layer on the performance of organic photovoltaic cells according to the thickness and temperature of the interlayer. The characteristics of organic photovoltaic cells such as fill factor, current density, and open circuit voltage are continuously improved by increasing the temperature of the WO3 interlayer. The surface of a treated WO3 film promotes the crystallization of P3HT because a treated WO3 film is more hydrophobic than a pristine WO3 film. Furthermore, the energy barrier between P3HT and the WO3 interlayer is minimized since the work function of the WO3 film after annealing progressively increases until a hole can be smoothly transferred. Therefore, organic photovoltaic cells using an interlayer of treated WO3 film have higher hole mobility and better efficiency. The efficiency of an organic photovoltaic cell with a 40nm-thick WO3 interlayer is significantly enhanced from 0.94 to 3.04% as the temperature changes from room temperature to 350°C under AM 1.5G illumination.

Abstract: The pancreatic duodenal homeodomain transcription factor PDX-1 plays a pivotal role in the development of the pancreas and the maintenance of glucose homeostasis by pancreatic β-cells. Recently, we found that the highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed tetrameric Ser/Thr protein kinase CK2, which is formed by two catalytic subunits (α and/or α′) and two non-catalytic subunits (β), phosphorylates PDX-1. So far, only little is known about CK2 in pancreatic β-cells and how this enzyme is regulated in these cells. In the present study, we found that (i) CK2 binds to PDX-1, (ii) the binding between CK2 and PDX-1 is regulated by glucose, (iii) glucose modulates the subcellular localization of PDX-1 and CK2 and (iv) the kinase activity is also regulated by glucose. Our novel data indicate that CK2 is a co-factor of PDX-1 in response to glucose in pancreatic β-cells.

Abstract: In this work, a novel sort of form-stable phase change materials (FSPCMs) which possesses simultaneously the shape memory function was designed and prepared. The FSPCMs consist of paraffin with melting point of approximately 53°C as a latent heat storage material and olefin block copolymer (OBC) as a supporting material. With mass percentage of paraffin up to 40wt%, the FSPCMs exhibit good shape stability until temperature approaches 90°C as shown by visual photographs, and this result is confirmed by dynamic mechanical analysis. At the same time, composites with 40wt% paraffin also maintain the excellent mechanical property of OBC and exhibit large elongation at break as well as similar tensile stress, insuring excellent tenacity and deformation ability. The results of shape memory testing demonstrate that the composites possess good shape memory property, with nearly complete shape fixing and recovery. Compared with other reported FSPCMs, this material can be both temperature-controlled and temperature-sensitive, and may show advantages in some advanced applications such as intelligent textile. The diversity of paraffin endows the composites with flexibility of design for applications with wide range of temperatures. Considering the inexpensive sources and easy processing, this work may open up opportunities to produce difunctional FSPCMs in the industrial field.

Abstract: The influence of annealing treatment of molybdenum (Mo) film on the growth of CuInSe2 (CIS) thin film has been studied. We show that Mo film is with much better electrical conductivity and adhesion after being annealed in vacuum. It is found that annealing of Mo film not only modifies the orientation of In2Se3 (IS) precursor, but also the texture of CIS crystal. Thermally treated Mo film favors the growth of (220/204) oriented CIS film. CIS solar cell grown on annealed Mo film is found to be with higher device efficiency, which is attributed to the increased fill factor (FF).

Abstract: The polymer and organic solar cell technology is critically presented in the context of other thin film technologies with a specific focus on what it will take to make them a commercial success. The academic success of polymer and organic solar cells far outweigh any other solar cell technology when judging by the number of scientific publications whereas the application of polymer and organic solar cells in real products is completely lacking. This aspect is viewed as a sign of the polymer and organic solar cell field as being more complex and less mature and it raises the question of whether an organic analog to a successful inorganic technology is forcibly needed and indeed whether it is at all worth exploring beyond academia.

Abstract: In order to find a novel photosensitizer to be used in photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment, we have previously showed that the cationic zinc(II) phthalocyanine named Pc13, the sulfur-linked dye 2,9(10),16(17),23(24)-tetrakis[(2-trimethylammonium) ethylsulfanyl]phthalocyaninatozinc(II) tetraiodide, exerts a selective phototoxic effect on human nasopharynx KB carcinoma cells and induces an apoptotic response characterized by an increase in the activity of caspase-3. Since the activation of an apoptotic pathway by chemotherapeutic agents contributes to the elimination of malignant cells, in this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor action of Pc13. We found that after light exposure, Pc13 induced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are mediating the resultant cytotoxic action on KB cells. ROS led to an early permeabilization of lysosomal membranes as demonstrated by the reduction of lysosome fluorescence with acridine orange and the release of lysosomal proteases to cytosol. Treatment with antioxidants inhibited ROS generation, preserved the integrity of lysosomal membrane and increased cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Lysosome disruption was followed by mitochondrial depolarization, cytosolic release of cytochrome C and caspases activation. Although no change in the total amount of Bax was observed, the translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria, the cleavage of the pro-apoptotic protein Bid, together with the decrease of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 indicated the involvement of Bcl-2 family proteins in the induction of the mitochondrial pathway. It was also demonstrated that cathepsin D, but not caspase-8, contributed to Bid cleavage. In conclusion, Pc13-induced cell photodamage is triggered by ROS generation and activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway through the release of lysosomal proteases. In addition, our results also indicated that Pc13 induced a caspase-dependent apoptotic response, being activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3 the result of a post-mitochondrial event.

Abstract: Narrow-bandgap CuIn(Se1-x,Tex)2–based solar cells for bottom cell application in multijunction photovoltaic devices were developed and characterized. Compact and well crystallized 2μm films are obtained by single-stage coevaporation process on Mo-coated soda lime glass. Narrow bandgaps ranging from 0.98eV to 0.88eV were measured depending on the Te content of the films. The solar cells were characterized by current density versus voltage under standard AM 1.5 illumination and under a wider bandgap CIGSe/SLG filter. The same methodology was applied for the spectral response analysis, and the beneficial effect of the narrow bandgap in the multijunction configuration was remarkable in the low energy spectral region. Efficiencies higher than 7% under AM 1.5 illumination, and close to 2% in the multijunction-like configuration, were achieved.

Abstract: A photon-enhanced thermionic solar cell (PETSC) is a new type of solar energy conversion device that simultaneously uses light and heat from the sun. In this paper, a PETSC model is briefly described, which includes the thermal radiation between the cathode and the anode and the heat losses from the two electrode plates to the environment. Analytic expressions are derived for the power output and overall efficiency of the PETSC. Energy balance equations are used to calculate the operating temperatures of the cathode and anode electrodes for given values of the band gap energy and electron affinity of the cathode material. The performance characteristics of the PETSC are determined by numerical calculation. The maximum efficiency of the PETSC is clearly larger than that of traditional thermionic devices or solar cells. The optimal values of the band gap energy and electron affinity of the cathode material at the maximum efficiency are determined, and consequently, the operating temperatures of the cathode and anode electrodes can be optimally designed. The results obtained in this study may provide guidance for the appropriate selection of cathode materials and the optimum design of practical PETSC devices.

Abstract: Hypoxia induces severe changes in cell biology, particularly affecting energy production pathways. Although the theme has been widely investigated, particularly in transformed cells, studies of the mitochondrial bioenergetics of normal cells exposed to both prolonged hypoxic periods and low or null glucose concentration have been scarcely addressed. To evaluate the mitochondrial changes of cells exposed to the latter conditions, we set experiments in which the contribution of the mitochondrial energy production was maximized at the expenses of low glycolysis. Human fibroblasts were exposed to 1% oxygen tension, a hypoxic condition experimentally established for these cells, and grown in glucose deficient media. At variance with fibroblasts grown in 5–25mM glucose, fibroblasts grown in glucose deficiency adapted to hypoxia by reducing only slightly the mitochondrial mass and preserving a well structured network as it occurs in normoxia. Moreover, the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) rate of the mitochondria was enhanced, due to increased OXPHOS complexes level. The master transcriptional modulator induced by hypoxia HIF-1α and BNIP3, a factor activating mitochondrial autophagy, were expressed both in the presence and in the absence of glucose, but to a lower level in the latter condition. Similarly, the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 active fragment (LC3-II), a typical marker of autophagy, was found less expressed in glucose-free medium than in the presence of glucose. Therefore, our data show for the first time that glucose availability significantly affects the hypoxia-induced HIF-1/BNIP3 response, and in particular glucose absence results in enhancing the OXPHOS rate.

Abstract: For the purpose of manufacturing high efficiency p-type CZ crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells with conventional plated metallization and a passivated rear surface and local contacts, a thermally stable passivating system of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) deposited a-Si:H/SiNx:H stack was developed in this work. Good thermal stability of this passivating stack capable of withstanding over 90min thermal annealing at 400°C enabled the implementation of hydrogenation processes to significantly enhance minority carrier lifetimes (τeff) in the bulk while simultaneously achieving compatibility with the metal contacting schemes that require relatively low sintering temperatures. Point local back surface field (LBSF) regions with effective surface recombination velocities (SRV) of less than 4800±400cm/s were formed by laser-doping (LD) technique with optimized laser parameters on test wafers. The combination of the optimized a-Si:H/SiNx:H rear surface passivating stack, hydrogenation of the bulk and high quality LBSF formed by LD technique resulted in passivated emitter and rear locally diffused (PERL) cells with efficiency of up to 20.28% on a 13cm2 industrial B-doped CZ silicon wafer. This is close to the record 20.3% efficient Pluto–PERL cells reported earlier this year and using the identically front surface designs. τeff of 1.7ms with corresponding upperbound for the SRV of 5.8cm/s was demonstrated with the same passivating stack on 1Ωcm p-type FZ wafers.

Abstract: Zinc oxide nanoparticle is one of the most important materials with diverse applications. However, it has been reported that zinc oxide nanoparticles are toxic to organisms, and that oxidative stress is often hypothesized to be an important factor in cytotoxicity mediated by zinc oxide nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the mechanism of toxicity of zinc oxide nanoparticles has not been completely understood. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles and the possible molecular mechanism involved in calcium homeostasis mediated by plasma membrane calcium ATPase in rat retinal ganglion cells. Real-time cell electronic sensing assay showed that zinc oxide nanoparticles could exert cytotoxic effect on rat retinal ganglion cells in a concentration-dependent manner; flow cytometric analysis indicated that zinc oxide nanoparticles could lead to cell damage by inducing the overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, zinc oxide nanoparticles could also apparently decrease the expression level and their activity of plasma membrane calcium ATPase, which finally disrupt the intracellular calcium homeostasis and result in cell death. Taken together, zinc oxide nanoparticles could apparently decrease the plasma membrane calcium ATPase expression, inhibit their activity, cause the elevated intracellular calcium ion level and disrupt the intracellular calcium homeostasis. Further, the disrupted calcium homeostasis will trigger mitochondrial dysfunction, generate excessive reactive oxygen species, and finally initiate cell death. Thus, the disrupted calcium homeostasis is involved in the zinc oxide nanoparticle-induced rat retinal ganglion cell death.

Abstract: A new lectin from the marine sponge Haliclona caerulea (H-3) was isolated using a combination of hydrophobic interaction chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. H-3 is a protein with three distinct bands on SDS-PAGE: 9kDa, 16kDa and 18kDa. Nevertheless, on gel filtration and N-PAGE, H-3 showed a symmetrical peak and a unique band, respectively. Hemagglutinating activity of H-3 was stable at neutral pH and temperatures up to 60°C. N-Acetylgalactosamine and porcine stomach mucin were the most potent inhibitors of H-3. Primary structure of the lectin was determined using tandem mass spectrometry, and it showed no similarity to any members of the animal lectin families. Top down fragmentation revealed some posttranslational modifications in H-3, including glycosylation. The glycan composition of H-3 was determined, and its structure was predicted. Furthermore, H-3 is a blue protein, binding to a chromophore(-597) by weak interactions, and this is the first time that the interaction between one lectin and a natural chromophore has been shown.

Abstract: Poly[quinacridone-co-quaterthiophene] (PQCQT) was synthesized through a Suzuki coupling reaction by introducing the characterization and self-assembly of quinacridone and quaterthiophene derivatives. The PQCQT was dissolved in a common organic solvent with an Mn value of 52.9kg/mol. The optical band gap energy of the PQCQT was similar to the P3HT at 2.12eV. The energy of the HOMO of the PQCQT was −5.10eV, and the energy of the LUMO was −2.98eV. The results of the X-ray diffraction measurement showed that the Lamellar d-spacing (d1) of the out-of-plane PQCQT was 23.2Å, and the π–π stacking distance (dπ) between the layers was 3.5Å. A bulk-heterojunction type of polymer solar cell was produced with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active-layer/PFN/Al. When the ratio of the PQCQT and PC71BM was 1:2, the device performed best with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.3%.

Abstract: This review describes a specific group of non-vacuum methods for depositing kesterite solar cell absorbers, which we refer to as direct solution coating (DSC). These methods work by coating a layer of precursor-containing solution on the surface of a substrate followed by appropriate thermal processing to yield the desired kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 phase. General aspects, challenges and future prospects of the DSC are discussed in detail. Two research highlights are presented in which kesterite layers are processed from solutions of metal salts in simple non-toxic organic solvents to yield up to 7.5% efficient solar cells.

Abstract: To increase the performance of thin-film solar cells, the solar spectrum splitting technique has been considered and studied. It was found from simulations that the total efficiency of nearly 25% can be obtained at the splitting wavelength of 600nm with the top cell using higher band gap material. Experiments have been carried out to verify the simulation results. Up to now the total efficiency of about 22.0% has been obtained using a-Si:H and Cu(In1−x,Gax)Se2 as the top and bottom cells, respectively, at the splitting wavelength of 614nm which is similar to the simulation results. This result shows that our developed splitting technique is promising for high-performance thin-film solar cells.

Abstract: Oncostatin M, a member of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines, has been implicated in tumorigenesis of human prostate cancer. In the current study, we demonstrate that oncostatin M promotes human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell-stimulated tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft transplantation model of the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3M-luc-C6, a PC3M cell line expressing the luciferase gene. Conditioned medium derived from oncostatin M-treated mesenchymal stem cells stimulated adhesion of PC-3M-luc-C6 cells. We identified TGFBI and periostin, extracellular matrix proteins implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis, as oncostatin M-induced secreted proteins in mesenchymal stem cells. Treatment with oncostatin M stimulated secretion of periostin and TGFBI from mesenchymal stem cells in a time-dependent manner. Immunodepletion of TGFBI and periostin from conditioned medium derived from oncostatin M-treated mesenchymal stem cells resulted in abrogation of adhesion of PC-3M-luc-C6 cells stimulated by oncostatin M-conditioned medium. In addition, small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of TGFBI and periostin resulted in abrogation of cell adhesion stimulated by oncostatin M-conditioned medium. These results suggest that mesenchymal stem cell-derived TGFBI and periostin play a key role in tumorigenesis by stimulating adhesion of prostate cancer cells.

Abstract: A round robin study across 15 laboratories in China was carried out using single junction devices with an active area of 1cm2 and differently sized small module with an active area of 20 and 24cm2 respectively. The devices represented the state of the art in terms of processing as they did not employ indium or vacuum and were prepared using only printing and coating techniques on flexible substrates. The devices were studied in their flexible form and thus approach the vision of what the polymer solar cell is. The main purpose of the work was to establish and chart geographic and cultural differences in what constitutes a competent IV-characterization procedure and also to establish the spread in measured data across the globe. The main finding is that efficiency data deviated up to 30% from the mean while an overall relative standard deviation of 12% was observed. Collating this spread with previous findings points toward a seemingly region-independent i.e. global observation of the uncertainty in the IV-characterization of a polymer solar cell. Finally, we highlight what might be done to improve the accuracy of the reported data.

Epigenetic downregulation of RUNX3 by DNA methylation induces docetaxel chemoresistance in human lung adenocarcinoma cells by activation of the AKT pathway,

Abstract: The RUNX3 gene has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor gene implicated in various cancers, but its association with tumor chemoresistance has not been fully understood. Here, we investigated the effect of epigenetic downregulation of RUNX3 in docetaxel resistance of human lung adenocarcinoma and its possible molecular mechanisms. RUNX3 was found to be downregulated by hypermethylation in docetaxel-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells. Its overexpression could resensitize cells to docetaxel both in vitro and in vivo by growth inhibition, enhancement of apoptosis and G1 phase arrest. Conversely, knockdown of RUNX3 could lead to the decreased sensitivity of parental human lung adenocarcinoma cells to docetaxel by enhancing proliferative capacity. Furthermore, we showed that overexpression of RUNX3 could inactivate the AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway in the docetaxel-resistant cells. Importantly, co-transfection of RUNX3 and constitutively active Akt1 could reverse the effects of RUNX3 overexpression, while treatment with the MK-2206 (AKT inhibitor) mimicked the effects of RUNX3 overexpression in docetaxel-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that decreased RUNX3 expression was correlated with high expression of Akt1 and decreased sensitivity of patients to docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Taken together, our results suggest that epigenetic downregulation of RUNX3 can induce docetaxel resistance in human lung adenocarcinoma cells by activating AKT signaling and increasing expression of RUNX3 may represent a promising strategy for reversing docetaxel resistance in the future.

Abstract: Human cysteine cathepsins (Cats) are implicated in lung injuries and tissue remodeling and have recently emerged as important players in pulmonary inflammations. The proteolytic activities of Cat B, L, K, S and H are dramatically increased in the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), suggesting a possible involvement in the CF pathophysiology. We found that pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) that participates to innate host defense is extensively degraded in CF expectorations. Breakdown of SP-A was markedly decreased in CF sputum by E-64 and Mu-Leu-Hph-VSPh, a Cat S inhibitor. Cat S cleaved efficiently and specifically SP-A within critical residues of the solvent-exposed loop of its carbohydrate recognition (C-type lectin) domain that allows binding to pathogens. Cat S decreased aggregation properties of SP-A (self-aggregation, aggregation of phospholipid vesicles and rough LPS). Moreover cleavage of SP-A by Cat S reduced binding to yeast mannan and impaired agglutination of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a foremost detrimental pathogen colonizing the lungs of CF patients. Besides human neutrophil serine proteases and bacterial proteases, we propose that Cat S may participate in the pathophysiology of CF by weakening the antibacterial activity of SP-A. More broadly, present results provide further indication that Cat S, along with Cats B and L, could display immuno-modulatory functions by inactivating key proteins involved in the innate immunity defense.
