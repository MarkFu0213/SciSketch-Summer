Abstract: Summary
Although high c-Myc protein expression is observed alongside MYC amplification in some cancers, in most cases protein overexpression occurs in the absence of gene amplification, e.g., T cell lymphoma (TCL). Here, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II γ (CAMKIIγ) was shown to stabilize the c-Myc protein by directly phosphorylating it at serine 62 (S62). Furthermore, CAMKIIγ was shown to be essential for tumor maintenance. Inhibition of CAMKIIγ with a specific inhibitor destabilized c-Myc and reduced tumor burden. Importantly, high CAMKIIγ levels in patient TCL specimens correlate with increased c-Myc and pS62-c-Myc levels. Together, the CAMKIIγ:c-Myc axis critically influences the development and maintenance of TCL and represents a potential therapeutic target for TCL.

Abstract: Summary
Decreasing glucagon action lowers the blood glucose and may be useful therapeutically for diabetes. However, interrupted glucagon signaling leads to α cell proliferation. To identify postulated hepatic-derived circulating factor(s) responsible for α cell proliferation, we used transcriptomics/proteomics/metabolomics in three models of interrupted glucagon signaling and found that proliferation of mouse, zebrafish, and human α cells was mTOR and FoxP transcription factor dependent. Changes in hepatic amino acid (AA) catabolism gene expression predicted the observed increase in circulating AAs. Mimicking these AA levels stimulated α cell proliferation in a newly developed in vitro assay with L-glutamine being a critical AA. α cell expression of the AA transporter Slc38a5 was markedly increased in mice with interrupted glucagon signaling and played a role in α cell proliferation. These results indicate a hepatic α islet cell axis where glucagon regulates serum AA availability and AAs, especially L-glutamine, regulate α cell proliferation and mass via mTOR-dependent nutrient sensing.

Abstract: Summary
The Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, well known for its role in cell-cycle progression. However, it has been linked to additional functions, mainly in neuronal contexts, when using the co-activator Cdh1/Fzr. Here, our data indicate a post-mitotic requirement for the APC/CFzr/Cdh1 in epithelial cell patterning and planar cell polarity (PCP) in Drosophila. PCP signaling is critical for development by establishing cellular asymmetries and orientation within the plane of an epithelium, via differential localization of distinct complexes of core PCP factors. Loss of APC/C function leads to reduced levels of Dishevelled (Dsh), a core PCP factor. The effect of APC/C on Dsh is mediated by Nek2 kinase, which can phosphorylate Dsh and is a direct APC/CFzr/Cdh1 substrate. We have thus uncovered a pathway of regulation whereby APC/CFzr/Cdh1 negatively regulates Nek2, which negatively regulates Dsh, to ensure its proper stoichiometric requirement and localization during PCP establishment.

Abstract: Summary
Iron metabolism is regulated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. The mRNA of the iron-controlling gene, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), has long been believed to be negatively regulated by a yet-unidentified endonuclease. Here, we show that the endonuclease Regnase-1 is critical for the degradation of mRNAs involved in iron metabolism in vivo. First, we demonstrate that Regnase-1 promotes TfR1 mRNA decay. Next, we show that Regnase-1−/− mice suffer from severe iron deficiency anemia, although hepcidin expression is downregulated. The iron deficiency anemia is induced by a defect in duodenal iron uptake. We reveal that duodenal Regnase-1 controls the expression of PHD3, which impairs duodenal iron uptake via HIF2α suppression. Finally, we show that Regnase-1 is a HIF2α-inducible gene and thus provides a positive feedback loop for HIF2α activation via PHD3. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Regnase-1-mediated regulation of iron-related transcripts is essential for the maintenance of iron homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Piwi proteins and piRNAs protect eukaryotic germlines against the spread of transposons. During development in the ciliate Paramecium, two Piwi-dependent sRNA classes are involved in the elimination of transposons and transposon-derived DNA: scan RNAs (scnRNAs), associated with Ptiwi01 and Ptiwi09, and iesRNAs, whose binding partners we now identify as Ptiwi10 and Ptiwi11. scnRNAs derive from the maternal genome and initiate DNA elimination during development, whereas iesRNAs continue DNA targeting until the removal process is complete. Here, we show that scnRNAs and iesRNAs are processed by distinct Dicer-like proteins and bind Piwi proteins in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting separate biogenesis pathways. We also demonstrate that the PTIWI10 gene is transcribed from the developing nucleus and that its transcription depends on prior DNA excision, suggesting a mechanism of gene expression control triggered by the removal of short DNA segments interrupting the gene.

Abstract: Summary
Mammals have extremely limited regenerative capabilities; however, axolotls are profoundly regenerative and can replace entire limbs. The mechanisms underlying limb regeneration remain poorly understood, partly because the enormous and incompletely sequenced genomes of axolotls have hindered the study of genes facilitating regeneration. We assembled and annotated a de novo transcriptome using RNA-sequencing profiles for a broad spectrum of tissues that is estimated to have near-complete sequence information for 88% of axolotl genes. We devised expression analyses that identified the axolotl orthologs of cirbp and kazald1 as highly expressed and enriched in blastemas. Using morpholino anti-sense oligonucleotides, we find evidence that cirbp plays a cytoprotective role during limb regeneration whereas manipulation of kazald1 expression disrupts regeneration. Our transcriptome and annotation resources greatly complement previous transcriptomic studies and will be a valuable resource for future research in regenerative biology.

Abstract: Summary
Experience-dependent synapse refinement is essential for functional optimization of neural circuits. However, how sensory experience sculpts excitatory synaptic transmission is poorly understood. Here, we show that despite substantial remodeling of synaptic connectivity, AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission remains at equilibrium during the critical period in the mouse primary visual cortex. The maintenance of this equilibrium requires neurogranin (Ng), a postsynaptic calmodulin-binding protein important for synaptic plasticity. With normal visual experience, loss of Ng decreased AMPAR-positive synapse numbers, prevented AMPAR-silent synapse maturation, and increased spine elimination. Importantly, visual deprivation halted synapse loss caused by loss of Ng, revealing that Ng coordinates experience-dependent AMPAR-silent synapse conversion to AMPAR-active synapses and synapse elimination. Loss of Ng also led to sensitized long-term synaptic depression (LTD) and impaired visually guided behavior. Our synaptic interrogation reveals that experience-dependent coordination of AMPAR-silent synapse conversion and synapse elimination hinges upon Ng-dependent mechanisms for constructive synaptic refinement during the critical period.

Abstract: Summary
Loss-of-function mutations in TTC19 (tetra-tricopeptide repeat domain 19) have been associated with severe neurological phenotypes and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III deficiency. We previously demonstrated the mitochondrial localization of TTC19 and its link with complex III biogenesis. Here we provide detailed insight into the mechanistic role of TTC19, by investigating a Ttc19−/− mouse model that shows progressive neurological and metabolic decline, decreased complex III activity, and increased production of reactive oxygen species. By using both the Ttc19−/− mouse model and a range of human cell lines, we demonstrate that TTC19 binds to the fully assembled complex III dimer, i.e., after the incorporation of the iron-sulfur Rieske protein (UQCRFS1). The in situ maturation of UQCRFS1 produces N-terminal polypeptides, which remain bound to holocomplex III. We show that, in normal conditions, these UQCRFS1 fragments are rapidly removed, but when TTC19 is absent they accumulate within complex III, causing its structural and functional impairment.

Abstract: Summary
Cholinergic neurotransmission throughout the neocortex and hippocampus regulates arousal, learning, and attention. However, owing to the poorly characterized timing and location of acetylcholine release, its detailed behavioral functions remain unclear. Using electrochemical biosensors chronically implanted in mice, we made continuous measurements of the spatiotemporal dynamics of acetylcholine release across multiple behavioral states. We found that tonic levels of acetylcholine release were coordinated between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and maximal during training on a rewarded working memory task. Tonic release also increased during REM sleep but was contingent on subsequent wakefulness. In contrast, coordinated phasic acetylcholine release occurred only during the memory task and was strongly localized to reward delivery areas without being contingent on trial outcome. These results show that coordinated acetylcholine release between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is associated with reward and arousal on distinct timescales, providing dual mechanisms to support learned behavior acquisition during cognitive task performance.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin featuring the H3 variant CENP-A at the centromere is critical for its mitotic function and epigenetic maintenance. Assembly of centromeric chromatin is restricted to G1 phase through inhibitory action of Cdk1/2 kinases in other phases of the cell cycle. Here, we identify the two key targets sufficient to maintain cell-cycle control of CENP-A assembly. We uncovered a single phosphorylation site in the licensing factor M18BP1 and a cyclin A binding site in the CENP-A chaperone, HJURP, that mediated specific inhibitory phosphorylation. Simultaneous expression of mutant proteins lacking these residues results in complete uncoupling from the cell cycle. Consequently, CENP-A assembly is fully recapitulated under high Cdk activities, indistinguishable from G1 assembly. We find that Cdk-mediated inhibition is exerted by sequestering active factors away from the centromere. Finally, we show that displacement of M18BP1 from the centromere is critical for the assembly mechanism of CENP-A.

Abstract: Summary
It is not understood why healthy tissues can exhibit varying levels of sensitivity to the same toxic stimuli. Using BH3 profiling, we find that mitochondria of many adult somatic tissues, including brain, heart, and kidneys, are profoundly refractory to pro-apoptotic signaling, leading to cellular resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapies and ionizing radiation. In contrast, mitochondria from these tissues in young mice and humans are primed for apoptosis, predisposing them to undergo cell death in response to genotoxic damage. While expression of the apoptotic protein machinery is nearly absent by adulthood, in young tissues its expression is driven by c-Myc, linking developmental growth to cell death. These differences may explain why pediatric cancer patients have a higher risk of developing treatment-associated toxicities.

Abstract: Dermal fibroblasts play a vital role in maintaining skin function. They not only synthesize and secrete extracellular matrix molecules, but also produce a complex mixture of bioactive factors, which both contribute to immune regulation and wound healing. Fibroblasts isolated from skin tissue exhibit wide range of potentials, especially in regenerative medicine. The use of fibroblast cultures for medical purposes requires standardization of cell preparations. To achieve this, we isolated and characterized dermal fibroblasts from human foreskin with a standardized method. The obtained cells grew as typical morphology of fibroblasts, and expressed intermediate filament protein vimentin and nestin. Immunophenotypic analysis indicated that the isolated fibroblasts expressed mesenchymal surface markers CD73, CD90, CD44 and CD105, and were negative for haematopoietic markers CD45 and CD34. Growth kinetics analysis of the cells showed high proliferative properties. Furthermore, cryopreservation had no influence on cell morphology and growth properties. Here, we describe a standardized, repeatable method for isolation of fibroblasts from human foreskin tissues and identify their biological characters according to morphologic, immunohistologic and proliferative criteria, which would be meaningful for future clinical trials and regenerative medicine purposes.

Abstract: Ephrin-A5 has been implicated in the regulation of brain morphogenesis and axon pathfinding. In this study, we used bacterial homologous recombination to express a LacZ reporter in various ephrin-A5 BAC clones to identify elements that regulate ephrin-A5 gene expression during mesencephalon development. We found that there is mesencephalon-specific enhancer activity localized to a specific +25.0 kb to +30.5 kb genomic region in the first intron of ephrin-A5. Further comparative genomic analysis indicated that two evolutionary conserved regions, ECR1 and ECR2, were present within this 5.5 kb region. Deletion of ECR1 from the enhancer resulted in disrupted mesencephalon-specific enhancer activity in transgenic embryos. We also found a consensus binding site for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) in a highly conserved region at the 3′-end of ECR1. We further demonstrated that specific deletion of the bHLH TF binding site abrogated the mesencephalon-specific enhancer activity in transgenic embryos. Finally, both electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase-based transactivation assay revealed that the transcription factor Ascl1 bound the bHLH consensus binding site in the mesencephalon-specific ephrin-A5 enhancer in vitro. Together, these results suggest that the bHLH TF binding site in ECR1 is involved in the positive regulation of ephrin-A5 gene expression during the development of the mesencephalon.

Abstract: Summary
Triglyceride (TG) storage in adipose tissue provides the major reservoir for metabolic energy in mammals. During lipolysis, fatty acids (FAs) are hydrolyzed from adipocyte TG stores and transported to other tissues for fuel. For unclear reasons, a large portion of hydrolyzed FAs in adipocytes is re-esterified to TGs in a “futile,” ATP-consuming, energy dissipating cycle. Here we show that FA re-esterification during adipocyte lipolysis is mediated by DGAT1, an ER-localized DGAT enzyme. Surprisingly, this re-esterification cycle does not preserve TG mass but instead functions to protect the ER from lipotoxic stress and related consequences, such as adipose tissue inflammation. Our data reveal an important role for DGAT activity and TG synthesis generally in averting ER stress and lipotoxicity, with specifically DGAT1 performing this function during stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes.

Calcium induces tobramycin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by regulating RND efflux pumps,

Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic multidrug resistant pathogen causing severe chronic infections. Our previous studies showed that elevated calcium (Ca2+) enhances production of several virulence factors and plant infectivity of the pathogen. Here we show that Ca2+ increases resistance of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to tobramycin, antibiotic commonly used to treat Pseudomonas infections. LC–MS/MS-based comparative analysis of the membrane proteomes of P aeruginosa grown at elevated versus not added Ca2+, determined that the abundances of two RND (resistance-nodulation-cell division) efflux pumps, MexAB-OprM and MexVW-OprM, were increased in the presence of elevated Ca2+. Analysis of twelve transposon mutants with disrupted RND efflux pumps showed that six of them (mexB, muxC, mexY, mexJ, czcB, and mexE) contribute to Ca2+-induced tobramycin resistance. Transcriptional analyses by promoter activity and RT-qPCR showed that the expression of mexAB, muxABC, mexXY, mexJK, czcCBA, and mexVW is increased by elevated Ca2+. Disruption of mexJ, mexC, mexI, and triA significantly decreased Ca2+-induced plant infectivity of the pathogen. Earlier, our group showed that PAO1 maintains intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+in) homeostasis, which mediates Ca2+ regulation of P. aeruginosa virulence, and identified four putative Ca2+ transporters involved in this process (Guragain et al., 2013). Here we show that three of these transporters (PA2435, PA2092, PA4614) play role in Ca2+-induced tobramycin resistance and one of them (PA2435) contributes to Ca2+ regulation of mexAB-oprM promoter activity. Furthermore, mexJ, czcB, and mexE contribute to the maintenance of Ca2+in homeostasis. This provides the first evidence that Ca2+in homeostasis mediates Ca2+ regulation of RND transport systems, which contribute to Ca2+-enhanced tobramycin resistance and plant infectivity in P. aeruginosa.

Abstract: We have recently demonstrated that in a rat model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), there is a significant decrease in the duration of the depolarization-evoked Ca2+ transient in small diameter, IB4+, and capsaicin-responsive neurons innervating the glabrous skin of the hindpaw. This change was specific to the transient duration and significantly smaller if not undetectable in neurons innervating the dorsal skin of the hindpaw or the skin of the inner thigh. Given the importance of mitochondria in intracellular Ca2+ regulation and the findings of chemotherapy-associated increase in mitotoxicity along the sensory neuron axons, we hypothesized that CIPN is due to both increases and decreases in mitochondria function, with changes manifest in distinct subpopulations of afferents. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used confocal microscopy and Ca2+ imaging in combination with pharmacological manipulations to study paclitaxel-induced changes in retrograde tracer-labeled neurons from naïve, vehicle-treated, and paclitaxel-treated rats. Paclitaxel treatment was not associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential or increased superoxide levels in the somata of putative nociceptive glabrous skin neurons. However, it was associated with significant increases in the relative contribution of mitochondria to the control of the evoked Ca2+ transient duration in putative nociceptive glabrous skin neurons, as well as increases in mitotracker and Tom20 staining which reflected an increase in mitochondrial volume. Furthermore, the relative contribution of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase to the regulation of the duration of the depolarization evoked Ca2+ transient was also increased in this subpopulation of neurons from paclitaxel treated rats. Our results indicate that the paclitaxel-induced decrease in the duration of the evoked Ca2+ transient is due to both direct and indirect influences of mitochondria. It remains to be determined if and how these changes contribute to the manifestation of CIPN.

Abstract: Summary
During termination of translation, the nascent peptide is first released from the ribosome, which must be subsequently disassembled into subunits in a process known as ribosome recycling. In bacteria, termination and recycling are mediated by the translation factors RF, RRF, EF-G, and IF3, but their precise roles have remained unclear. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence to track the conformation and composition of the ribosome in real time during termination and recycling. Our results show that peptide release by RF induces a rotated ribosomal conformation. RRF binds to this rotated intermediate to form the substrate for EF-G that, in turn, catalyzes GTP-dependent subunit disassembly. After the 50S subunit departs, IF3 releases the deacylated tRNA from the 30S subunit, thus preventing reassembly of the 70S ribosome. Our findings reveal the post-termination rotated state as the crucial intermediate in the transition from termination to recycling.

Abstract: Summary
The Mre11 complex (Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1) is integral to both DNA repair and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent DNA damage signaling. All three Mre11 complex components are essential for viability at the cellular and organismal levels. To delineate essential and non-essential Mre11 complex functions that are mediated by Nbs1, we used TALEN-based genome editing to derive Nbs1 mutant mice (Nbs1mid mice), which harbor mutations in the Mre11 interaction domain of Nbs1. Nbs1mid alleles that abolished interaction were incompatible with viability. Conversely, a 108-amino-acid Nbs1 fragment comprising the Mre11 interface was sufficient to rescue viability and ATM activation in cultured cells and support differentiation of hematopoietic cells in vivo. These data indicate that the essential role of Nbs1 is via its interaction with Mre11 and that most of the Nbs1 protein is dispensable for Mre11 complex functions and suggest that Mre11 and Rad50 directly activate ATM.

Abstract: Summary
Arrested replication forks lead to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are a major source of genome rearrangements. Yet DSB repair in the context of broken forks remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that DSBs that are formed at arrested forks in the budding yeast ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) locus are normally repaired by pathways dependent on the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex but independent of HR. HR is also dispensable for DSB repair at stalled forks at tRNA genes. In contrast, in cells lacking the core replisome component Ctf4, DSBs are formed more frequently, and these DSBs undergo end resection and HR-mediated repair that is prone to rDNA hyper-amplification; this highlights Ctf4 as a key regulator of DSB end resection at arrested forks. End resection also occurs during physiological rDNA amplification even in the presence of Ctf4. Suppression of end resection is thus important for protecting DSBs at arrested forks from chromosome rearrangements.

Abstract: Eukaryotic thrombospondin type 3 repeat (TT3R) is an efficient calcium ion (Ca2+) binding motif only found in mammalian thrombospondin family. TT3R has also been found in prokaryotic cellulase Cel5G, which was thought to forfeit the Ca2+-binding capability due to the formation of intra-repeat disulfide bonds, instead of the inter-repeat ones possessed by eukaryotic TT3Rs. In this study, we have identified an enormous number of prokaryotic TT3R-containing proteins belonging to several different protein families, including outer membrane protein A (OmpA), an important structural protein connecting the outer membrane and the periplasmic peptidoglycan layer in gram-negative bacteria. Here, we report the crystal structure of the periplasmic region of OmpA from Capnocytophaga gingivalis, which contains a linker region comprising five consecutive TT3Rs. The structure of OmpA-TT3R exhibits a well-ordered architecture organized around two tightly-coordinated Ca2+ and confirms the presence of abnormal intra-repeat disulfide bonds. Further mutagenesis studies showed that the Ca2+-binding capability of OmpA-TT3R is indeed dependent on the proper formation of intra-repeat disulfide bonds, which help to fix a conserved glycine residue at its proper position for Ca2+ coordination. Additionally, despite lacking inter-repeat disulfide bonds, the interfaces between adjacent OmpA-TT3Rs are enhanced by both hydrophobic and conserved aromatic-proline interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Synucleins (α, β, γ-synuclein) are a family of abundant presynaptic proteins. α-Synuclein is causally linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In an effort to define their physiological and pathological function or functions, we investigated the effects of deleting synucleins and overexpressing α-synuclein PD mutations, in mice, on synapse architecture using electron microscopy (EM) and cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET). We show that synucleins are regulators of presynapse size and synaptic vesicle (SV) pool organization. Using cryo-ET, we observed that deletion of synucleins increases SV tethering to the active zone but decreases the inter-linking of SVs by short connectors. These ultrastructural changes were correlated with discrete protein phosphorylation changes in αβγ-synuclein−/− neurons. We also determined that α-synuclein PD mutants (PARK1/hA30P and PARK4/hα-syn) primarily affected presynaptic cytomatrix proximal to the active zone, congruent with previous findings that these PD mutations decrease neurotransmission. Collectively, our results suggest that synucleins are important orchestrators of presynaptic terminal topography.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptive immunity depends on diverse T cell receptor repertoires generated by variable, diversity, and joining (V[D]J) recombination. Here, we define the principles by which combinatorial diversity is generated in the murine Tcra repertoire. Tcra and Tcrd gene segments share the Tcra-Tcrd locus, with interspersed Vα and Vδ segments undergoing Vδ-Dδ-Jδ rearrangement in CD4−CD8− thymocytes and then multiple rounds of Vα-Jα rearrangement in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. We document stepwise, highly coordinated proximal-to-distal progressions of Vα and Jα use on individual Tcra alleles, limiting combinatorial diversity. This behavior is supported by an extended chromatin conformation in CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, with only nearby Vα and Jα segments contacting each other. Tcrd rearrangements can use distal Vδ segments due to a contracted Tcra-Tcrd conformation in CD4−CD8− thymocytes. These rearrangements expand the Tcra repertoire by truncating the Vα array to permit otherwise disfavored Vα-Jα combinations. Therefore, recombination events at two developmental stages with distinct chromatin conformations synergize to promote Tcra repertoire diversity.

Abstract: Summary
Glutamate is a ubiquitous neurotransmitter, mediating information flow between neurons. Defects in the regulation of glutamatergic transmission can result in glutamate toxicity, which is associated with neurodegeneration. Interestingly, glutamate receptors are expressed in glia, but little is known about their function, and the effects of their misregulation, in these non-neuronal cells. Here, we report a glio-protective role for Drosophila mir-263a mediated by its regulation of glutamate receptor levels in glia. mir-263a mutants exhibit a pronounced movement defect due to aberrant overexpression of CG5621/Grik, Nmdar1, and Nmdar2. mir-263a mutants exhibit excitotoxic death of a subset of astrocyte-like and ensheathing glia in the CNS. Glial-specific normalization of glutamate receptor levels restores cell numbers and suppresses the movement defect. Therefore, microRNA-mediated regulation of glutamate receptor levels protects glia from excitotoxicity, ensuring CNS health. Chronic low-level glutamate receptor overexpression due to mutations affecting microRNA (miRNA) regulation might contribute to glial dysfunction and CNS impairment.

Abstract: The inositol trisphosphate (IP3) signaling pathway evokes local Ca2+ signals (Ca2+ puffs) that arise from the concerted openings of clustered IP3 receptor/channels in the ER membrane. Physiological activation is triggered by binding of agonists to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) on the cell surface, leading to cleavage of phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate and release of IP3 into the cytosol. Photorelease of IP3 from a caged precursor provides a convenient and widely employed means to study the final stage of IP3-mediated Ca2+ liberation, bypassing upstream signaling events to enable more precise control of the timing and relative concentration of cytosolic IP3. Here, we address whether Ca2+ puffs evoked by photoreleased IP3 fully replicate those arising from physiological agonist stimulation. We imaged puffs in individual SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells that were sequentially stimulated by picospritzing extracellular agonist (carbachol, CCH or bradykinin, BK) followed by photorelease of a poorly-metabolized IP3 analog, i-IP3. The centroid localizations of fluorescence signals during puffs evoked in the same cells by agonists and photorelease substantially overlapped (within ∼1μm), suggesting that IP3 from both sources accesses the same, or closely co-localized clusters of IP3Rs. Moreover, the time course and spatial spread of puffs evoked by agonists and photorelease matched closely. Because photolysis generates IP3 uniformly throughout the cytoplasm, our results imply that IP3 generated in SH-SY5Y cells by activation of receptors to CCH and BK also exerts broadly distributed actions, rather than specifically activating a subpopulation of IP3Rs that are scaffolded in close proximity to cell surface receptors to form a signaling nanodomain.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated endothelial cells (TECs) regulate tumor cell aggressiveness. However, the core mechanism by which TECs confer stem cell-like activity to indolent tumors is unknown. Here, we used in vivo murine and human tumor models to identify the tumor-suppressive checkpoint role of TEC-expressed insulin growth factor (IGF) binding protein-7 (IGFBP7/angiomodulin). During tumorigenesis, IGFBP7 blocks IGF1 and inhibits expansion and aggresiveness of tumor stem-like cells (TSCs) expressing IGF1 receptor (IGF1R). However, chemotherapy triggers TECs to suppress IGFBP7, and this stimulates IGF1R+ TSCs to express FGF4, inducing a feedforward FGFR1-ETS2 angiocrine cascade that obviates TEC IGFBP7. Thus, loss of IGFBP7 and upregulation of IGF1 activates the FGF4-FGFR1-ETS2 pathway in TECs and converts naive tumor cells to chemoresistant TSCs, thereby facilitating their invasiveness and progression.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin and IGF1 signaling are important for adipose tissue development and function; however, their role in mature adipocytes is unclear. Mice with a tamoxifen-inducible knockout of insulin and/or IGF1 receptors (IR/IGF1R) demonstrate a rapid loss of white and brown fat due to increased lipolysis and adipocyte apoptosis. This results in insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hepatosteatosis, islet hyperplasia with hyperinsulinemia, and cold intolerance. This phenotype, however, resolves over 10–30 days due to a proliferation of preadipocytes and rapid regeneration of both brown and white adipocytes as identified by mTmG lineage tracing. This cycle can be repeated with a second round of receptor inactivation. Leptin administration prior to tamoxifen treatment blocks development of the metabolic syndrome without affecting adipocyte loss or regeneration. Thus, IR is critical in adipocyte maintenance, and this loss of adipose tissue stimulates regeneration of brown/white fat and reversal of metabolic syndrome associated with fat loss.

Abstract: Summary
APPL1- and RAB5-positive signaling endosomes play a crucial role in the activation of AKT in response to extracellular stimuli. Myosin VI (MYO6) and two of its cargo adaptor proteins, GIPC and TOM1/TOM1L2, localize to these peripheral endosomes and mediate endosome association with cortical actin filaments. Loss of MYO6 leads to the displacement of these endosomes from the cell cortex and accumulation in the perinuclear space. Depletion of this myosin not only affects endosome positioning, but also induces actin and lipid remodeling consistent with endosome maturation, including accumulation of F-actin and the endosomal lipid PI(3)P. These processes acutely perturb endosome function, as both AKT phosphorylation and RAC-dependent membrane ruffling were markedly reduced by depletion of either APPL1 or MYO6. These results place MYO6 and its binding partners at a central nexus in cellular signaling linking actin dynamics at the cell surface and endosomal signaling in the cell cortex.

Abstract: Summary
In multiple sclerosis (MS), soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is detrimental via activation of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), whereas transmembrane TNF is beneficial primarily by activating TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). Here, we investigate the role of TNFR2 in microglia and monocytes/macrophages in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, by cell-specific gene targeting. We show that TNFR2 ablation in microglia leads to early onset of EAE with increased leukocyte infiltration, T cell activation, and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). Conversely, TNFR2 ablation in monocytes/macrophages results in EAE suppression with impaired peripheral T cell activation and reduced CNS T cell infiltration and demyelination. Our work uncovers a dichotomy of function for TNFR2 in myeloid cells, with microglial TNFR2 providing protective signals to contain disease and monocyte/macrophagic TNFR2 driving immune activation and EAE initiation. This must be taken into account when targeting TNFR2 for therapeutic purposes in neuroinflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the main DNA interstrand crosslink repair pathway in higher eukaryotes requires mono-ubiquitination of FANCI and FANCD2 by FANCL, the E3 ligase subunit of the Fanconi anemia core complex. FANCI and FANCD2 form a stable complex; however, the molecular basis of their ubiquitination is ill defined. FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination by FANCL is stimulated by the presence of the FANCB and FAAP100 core complex components, through an unknown mechanism. How FANCI mono-ubiquitination is achieved remains unclear. Here, we use structural electron microscopy, combined with crosslink-coupled mass spectrometry, to find that FANCB, FANCL, and FAAP100 form a dimer of trimers, containing two FANCL molecules that are ideally poised to target both FANCI and FANCD2 for mono-ubiquitination. The FANCC-FANCE-FANCF subunits bridge between FANCB-FANCL-FAAP100 and the FANCI-FANCD2 substrate. A transient interaction with FANCC-FANCE-FANCF alters the FANCI-FANCD2 configuration, stabilizing the dimerization interface. Our data provide a model to explain how equivalent mono-ubiquitination of FANCI and FANCD2 occurs.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell quantification of transcription kinetics and variability promotes a mechanistic understanding of gene regulation. Here, using single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and mathematical modeling, we dissect cellular RNA dynamics for Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). FLC expression quantitatively determines flowering time and is regulated by antisense (COOLAIR) transcription. In cells without observable COOLAIR expression, we quantify FLC transcription initiation, elongation, intron processing, and lariat degradation, as well as mRNA release from the locus and degradation. In these heterogeneously sized cells, FLC mRNA number increases linearly with cell size, resulting in a large cell-to-cell variability in transcript level. This variation is accounted for by cell-size-dependent, Poissonian FLC mRNA production, but not by large transcriptional bursts. In COOLAIR-expressing cells, however, antisense transcription increases with cell size and contributes to FLC transcription decreasing with cell size. Our analysis therefore reveals an unexpected role for antisense transcription in modulating the scaling of transcription with cell size.

Abstract: Sugar cane extract (SCE) exhibits various biological effects and has been reported to enhance animal growth performance. However, the effect of SCE on inflammation in animals is still obscure. To study the effects and underlying mechanism of SCE on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colonic inflammation, forty female ICR mice (26.63±0.19g, 6-week-old) were assigned into four groups: a control group (Cont), a DSS-challenged group (DSS), a SCE-supplemented group (SCE), and a DSS+SCE group (DSS+SCE). Mice in Cont group and DSS group were fed basic diet and other mice received 1% SCE supplemented in basic diet from 6-week to 8-week-old. Mice in DSS and DSS+SCE groups were also given a 4% DSS solution from 7-week to 8-week-old via drinking water to induce colonic inflammation. After 2 weeks, mice were sacrificed and samples were collected. The results showed that dietary SCE alleviated DSS induced growth suppression, splenic damage, colonic histological changes, colonic inflammation, oxidative stress, and colonic dysfunction of tight junctions. Meanwhile, the DSS exposure activated nuclear transcription factor kappa B p65 and inhibited nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), while SCE markedly attenuated the DSS-promoted effect on the p65 nuclear accumulation and the DSS-inhibited effect on the Nrf2 nuclear accumulation. In conclusion, SCE conferred a protective role in the DSS-induced inflammation and the mechanism might be associated with the activated signals of the nuclear factor kappa B p65 and Nrf2.

Abstract: Summary
Immune cells constantly survey the host for pathogens or tumors and secrete cytokines to alert surrounding cells of these threats. In vivo, activated immune cells secrete cytokines for several hours, yet an acute immune reaction occurs over days. Given these divergent timescales, we addressed how cytokine-responsive cells translate brief cytokine exposure into phenotypic changes that persist over long timescales. We studied melanoma cell responses to transient exposure to the cytokine interferon γ (IFNγ) by combining a systems-scale analysis of gene expression dynamics with computational modeling and experiments. We discovered that IFNγ is captured by phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of viable cells both in vitro and in vivo then slowly released to drive long-term transcription of cytokine-response genes. This mechanism introduces an additional function for PS in dynamically regulating inflammation across diverse cancer and primary cell types and has potential to usher in new immunotherapies targeting PS and inflammatory pathways.

Abstract: Summary
The early cell divisions of many metazoan embryos are rapid and occur in the near absence of transcription. At the mid-blastula transition (MBT), the cell cycle elongates and several processes become established including the onset of bulk transcription and cell-cycle checkpoints. How these events are timed and coordinated is poorly understood. Here we show in Xenopus laevis that developmental activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk1 at the MBT results in the SCFβ-TRCP-dependent degradation of a limiting replication initiation factor Drf1. Inhibition of Drf1 is the primary mechanism by which Chk1 blocks cell-cycle progression in the early embryo and is an essential function of Chk1 at the blastula-to-gastrula stage of development. This study defines the downregulation of Drf1 as an important mechanism to coordinate the lengthening of the cell cycle and subsequent developmental processes.

Abstract: Summary
In response to activating signals, transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA and regulate gene expression. TF binding can be measured by protection of the bound sequence from DNase digestion (i.e., footprint). Here, we report that 80% of TF binding motifs do not show a measurable footprint, partly because of a variable cleavage pattern within the motif sequence. To more faithfully portray the effect of TFs on chromatin, we developed an algorithm that captures two TF-dependent effects on chromatin accessibility: footprinting and motif-flanking accessibility. The algorithm, termed bivariate genomic footprinting (BaGFoot), efficiently detects TF activity. BaGFoot is robust to different accessibility assays (DNase-seq, ATAC-seq), all examined peak-calling programs, and a variety of cut bias correction approaches. BaGFoot reliably predicts TF binding and provides valuable information regarding the TFs affecting chromatin accessibility in various biological systems and following various biological events, including in cases where an absolute footprint cannot be determined.

Abstract: Summary
Global changes in chromatin accessibility may drive cancer progression by reprogramming transcription factor (TF) binding. In addition, histone acetylation readers such as bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) have been shown to associate with these TFs and contribute to aggressive cancers including prostate cancer (PC). Here, we show that chromatin accessibility defines castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We show that the deregulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression is a driver of chromatin relaxation and that AR/androgen-regulated bromodomain-containing proteins (BRDs) mediate this effect. We also report that BRDs are overexpressed in CRPCs and that ATAD2 and BRD2 have prognostic value. Finally, we developed gene stratification signature (BROMO-10) for bromodomain response and PC prognostication, to inform current and future trials with drugs targeting these processes. Our findings provide a compelling rational for combination therapy targeting bromodomains in selected patients in which BRD-mediated TF binding is enhanced or modified as cancer progresses.

Abstract: Summary
The CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been shown to facilitate high levels of precise genome editing using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to serve as donor template DNA during homologous recombination (HR). However, the maximum AAV packaging capacity of ∼4.5 kb limits the donor size. Here, we overcome this constraint by showing that two co-transduced AAV vectors can serve as donors during consecutive HR events for the integration of large transgenes. Importantly, the method involves a single-step procedure applicable to primary cells with relevance to therapeutic genome editing. We use the methodology in primary human T cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to site-specifically integrate an expression cassette that, as a single donor vector, would otherwise amount to a total of 6.5 kb. This approach now provides an efficient way to integrate large transgene cassettes into the genomes of primary human cells using HR-mediated genome editing with AAV vectors.

Abstract: Summary
It is unclear how standing genetic variation affects the prognosis of prostate cancer patients. To provide one controlled answer to this problem, we crossed a dominant, penetrant mouse model of prostate cancer to Diversity Outbred mice, a collection of animals that carries over 40 million SNPs. Integration of disease phenotype and SNP variation data in 493 F1 males identified a metastasis modifier locus on Chromosome 8 (LOD = 8.42); further analysis identified the genes Rwdd4, Cenpu, and Casp3 as functional effectors of this locus. Accordingly, analysis of over 5,300 prostate cancer patient samples revealed correlations between the presence of genetic variants at these loci, their expression levels, cancer aggressiveness, and patient survival. We also observed that ectopic overexpression of RWDD4 and CENPU increased the aggressiveness of two human prostate cancer cell lines. In aggregate, our approach demonstrates how well-characterized genetic variation in mice can be harnessed in conjunction with systems genetics approaches to identify and characterize germline modifiers of human disease processes.

Abstract: Summary
Proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS) generates peptides that are presented by MHC class I molecules, but because their identification is challenging, the immunological relevance of spliced peptides remains unclear. Here, we developed a reverse immunology-based multi-level approach to identify proteasome-generated spliced epitopes. Applying this strategy to a murine Listeria monocytogenes infection model, we identified two spliced epitopes within the secreted bacterial phospholipase PlcB that primed antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in L. monocytogenes-infected mice. While reacting to the spliced epitopes, these CD8+ T cells failed to recognize the non-spliced peptide parts in the context of their natural flanking sequences. Thus, we here show that PCPS expands the CD8+ T cell response against L. monocytogenes by exposing spliced epitopes on the cell surface. Moreover, our multi-level strategy opens up opportunities to systematically investigate proteins for spliced epitope candidates and thus strategies for immunotherapies or vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
Regulated inter-mitochondrial fusion/fission is essential for maintaining optimal mitochondrial respiration and control of apoptosis and autophagy. In mammals, mitochondrial fusion is controlled by outer membrane GTPases MFN1 and MFN2 and by inner membrane (IM) GTPase OPA1. Disordered mitochondrial fusion/fission contributes to various pathologies, and MFN2 or OPA1 mutations underlie neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that the WBSCR16 protein is primarily associated with the outer face of the inner mitochondrial membrane and is important for mitochondrial fusion. We provide evidence of a WBSCR16/OPA1 physical interaction in the intact cell and of a WBSCR16 function as an OPA1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Homozygosity for a Wbscr16 mutation causes early embryonic lethality, whereas neurons of mice heterozygous for the mutation have mitochondria with reduced membrane potential and increased susceptibility to fragmentation upon exposure to stress, suggesting roles for WBSCR16 deficits in neuronal pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular signals are transduced to the cell nucleus by effectors that bind to enhancer complexes to operate transcriptional switches. For example, the Wnt enhanceosome is a multiprotein complex associated with Wnt-responsive enhancers through T cell factors (TCF) and kept silent by Groucho/TLE co-repressors. Wnt-activated β-catenin binds to TCF to overcome this repression, but how it achieves this is unknown. Here, we discover that this process depends on the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase Hyd/UBR5, which is required for Wnt signal responses in Drosophila and human cell lines downstream of activated Armadillo/β-catenin. We identify Groucho/TLE as a functionally relevant substrate, whose ubiquitylation by UBR5 is induced by Wnt signaling and conferred by β-catenin. Inactivation of TLE by UBR5-dependent ubiquitylation also involves VCP/p97, an AAA ATPase regulating the folding of various cellular substrates including ubiquitylated chromatin proteins. Thus, Groucho/TLE ubiquitylation by Hyd/UBR5 is a key prerequisite that enables Armadillo/β-catenin to activate transcription.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the adipocyte size and fate in subcutaneous fat (scAT) of cows diverging for genetic merit at mid lactation stage, when anabolic activity increases and animals are in a state of positive energy balance. Twenty mid lactation cows (180±20days in milk) grouped according to the Estimated Breeding Values (EBV) for milk yield in plus (EBVp) and minus (EBVm) variants were selected. Average of adipocytes area, proliferation and apoptotic labelling index as well as DLK-1 expression, a marker of pre-adipocytes, were immunohistochemically evaluated in scAT biopsies. In EBVp cows, the BCS was lower (P<0.01) whereas milk yield, protein, fat yield (P<0.001) and plasma free fatty acid concentration (P<0.05) were higher. The scAT of EBVp cows showed a significantly (P<0.001) higher frequency between 500 and 3000μm2 classes in comparison to EBVm cows, that showed a significantly (P<0.01) higher apoptotic labeling index. The immunohistochemical reaction showed DLK-1 positivity in scAT of EBVp cows. Taking together, the data indicate a link between milk yield genetic merit of cows, scAT morphology and function, suggesting greater dynamics and metabolic flexibility in EBVp cows.

Abstract: Summary
Lipoprotein cholesterol is delivered to the limiting membrane of late endosomes/lysosomes (LELs) by Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). However, the mechanism of cholesterol transport from LELs to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is poorly characterized. We report that oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 1L (ORP1L) is necessary for this stage of cholesterol export. CRISPR-mediated knockout of ORP1L in HeLa and HEK293 cells reduced esterification of cholesterol to the level in NPC1 knockout cells, and it increased the expression of sterol-regulated genes and de novo cholesterol synthesis, indicative of a block in cholesterol transport to the ER. In the absence of this transport pathway, cholesterol-enriched LELs accumulated in the Golgi/perinuclear region. Cholesterol delivery to the ER required the sterol-, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-, and vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP)-binding activities of ORP1L, as well as NPC1 expression. These results suggest that ORP1L-dependent membrane contacts between LELs and the ER coordinate cholesterol transfer with the retrograde movement of endo-lysosomal vesicles.

Abstract: Summary
Bone mineral density (BMD) is a highly heritable predictor of osteoporotic fracture. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for BMD have identified dozens of associations; yet, the genes responsible for most associations remain elusive. Here, we used a bone co-expression network to predict causal genes at BMD GWAS loci based on the premise that genes underlying a disease are often functionally related and functionally related genes are often co-expressed. By mapping genes implicated by BMD GWAS onto a bone co-expression network, we predicted and inferred the function of causal genes for 30 of 64 GWAS loci. We experimentally confirmed that two of the genes predicted to be causal, SPTBN1 and MARK3, are potentially responsible for the effects of GWAS loci on chromosomes 2p16.2 and 14q32.32, respectively. This approach provides a roadmap for the dissection of additional BMD GWAS associations. Furthermore, it should be applicable to GWAS data for a wide range of diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in transcriptional regulatory networks can significantly contribute to species evolution and adaptation. However, identification of genome-scale regulatory networks is an open challenge, especially in non-model organisms. Here, we introduce multi-species regulatory network learning (MRTLE), a computational approach that uses phylogenetic structure, sequence-specific motifs, and transcriptomic data, to infer the regulatory networks in different species. Using simulated data from known networks and transcriptomic data from six divergent yeasts, we demonstrate that MRTLE predicts networks with greater accuracy than existing methods because it incorporates phylogenetic information. We used MRTLE to infer the structure of the transcriptional networks that control the osmotic stress responses of divergent, non-model yeast species and then validated our predictions experimentally. Interrogating these networks reveals that gene duplication promotes network divergence across evolution. Taken together, our approach facilitates study of regulatory network evolutionary dynamics across multiple poorly studied species.

Abstract: Summary
Lymph nodes (LNs) are constructed of intricate networks of endothelial and mesenchymal stromal cells. How these lymphoid stromal cells (LSCs) regulate lymphoid tissue remodeling and contribute to immune responses remains poorly understood. We performed a comprehensive functional and transcriptional analysis of LSC responses to skin viral infection and found that LSC subsets responded robustly, with different kinetics for distinct pathogens. Recruitment of cells to inflamed LNs induced LSC expansion, while B cells sustained stromal responses in an antigen-independent manner. Infection induced rapid transcriptional responses in LSCs. This transcriptional program was transient, returning to homeostasis within 1 month of infection, yet expanded fibroblastic reticular cell networks persisted for more than 3 months after infection, and this altered LN composition reduced the magnitude of LSC responses to subsequent heterologous infection. Our results reveal the complexity of LSC responses during infection and suggest that amplified networks of LN stromal cells support successive immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing is a critical determinant of genome complexity and, by implication, is assumed to engender proteomic diversity. This notion has not been experimentally tested in a targeted, quantitative manner. Here, we have developed an integrative approach to ask whether perturbations in mRNA splicing patterns alter the composition of the proteome. We integrate RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (to comprehensively report intron retention, differential transcript usage, and gene expression) with a data-independent acquisition (DIA) method, SWATH-MS (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry), to capture an unbiased, quantitative snapshot of the impact of constitutive and alternative splicing events on the proteome. Whereas intron retention is accompanied by decreased protein abundance, alterations in differential transcript usage and gene expression alter protein abundance proportionate to transcript levels. Our findings illustrate how RNA splicing links isoform expression in the human transcriptome with proteomic diversity and provides a foundation for studying perturbations associated with human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The unfolded protein response (UPR), which protects cells against accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, is induced in several age-associated degenerative diseases. However, sustained UPR activation has negative effects on cellular functions and may worsen disease symptoms. It remains unknown whether and how UPR components can be utilized to counteract chronic ER proteinopathies. We found that promotion of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) through upregulation of ERAD-enhancing α-mannosidase-like proteins (EDEMs) protected against chronic ER proteinopathy without inducing toxicity in a Drosophila model. ERAD activity in the brain decreased with aging, and upregulation of EDEMs suppressed age-dependent behavioral decline and extended the lifespan without affecting the UPR gene expression network. Intriguingly, EDEM mannosidase activity was dispensable for these protective effects. Therefore, upregulation of EDEM function in the ERAD protects against ER proteinopathy in vivo and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for chronic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Cell and tissue morphogenesis depends on the correct regulation of non-muscle Myosin II, but how this motor protein is spatiotemporally controlled is incompletely understood. Here, we show that in asymmetrically dividing Drosophila neural stem cells, cell intrinsic polarity cues provide spatial and temporal information to regulate biased Myosin activity. Using live cell imaging and a genetically encoded Myosin activity sensor, we found that Drosophila Rho kinase (Rok) enriches for activated Myosin on the neuroblast cortex prior to nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB). After NEB, the conserved polarity protein Partner of Inscuteable (Pins) sequentially enriches Rok and Protein Kinase N (Pkn) on the apical neuroblast cortex. Our data suggest that apical Rok first increases phospho-Myosin, followed by Pkn-mediated Myosin downregulation, possibly through Rok inhibition. We propose that polarity-induced spatiotemporal control of Rok and Pkn is important for unequal cortical expansion, ensuring correct cleavage furrow positioning and the establishment of physical asymmetry.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of multiple metabolic complications. Physical activity is known to increase mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle, counteracting age-related decline in muscle function and protecting against metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Here, we investigated the effect of 4 months of exercise training on skeletal muscle mitochondria electron transport chain complexes and supercomplexes in 26 healthy, sedentary older adults. Exercise differentially modulated respiratory complexes. Complex I was the most upregulated complex and not stoichiometrically associated to the other complexes. In contrast to the other complexes, complex I was almost exclusively found assembled in supercomplexes in muscle mitochondria. Overall, supercomplex content was increased after exercise. In particular, complexes I, III, and IV were redistributed to supercomplexes in the form of I+III2+IV. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that exercise affects the stoichiometry of supercomplex formation in humans and thus reveal a novel adaptive mechanism for increased energy demand.

Abstract: Summary
Unimolecular dual incretins derived from hybridized glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) sequences have demonstrated synergistic reduction of adiposity in animal models and reductions of hyperglycemia in short-duration human trials. Here, we extend the characterization of NNC0090-2746 (also known as RG7697), a fatty-acylated dual agonist possessing in vitro balanced GIPR and GLP-1R agonism. In this 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 2a trial, patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin received 1.8 mg of NNC0090-2746 or placebo subcutaneously once daily. Liraglutide 1.8 mg (Victoza), starting with 2-week dose escalation, was administered subcutaneously once daily as an open-label reference arm. Measurements were collected at regular intervals after randomization. NNC0090-2746 significantly improved glycemic control and reduced body weight compared with placebo. Total cholesterol, alone among a range of lipid parameters, and leptin were both significantly reduced compared with placebo. Treatment with NNC0090-2746 was generally safe and well tolerated.

Abstract: Low back pain is a major public health issue in the Western world, one main cause is believed to be intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. To halt/diminish IVD degeneration, cell therapy using different biomaterials e.g. hydrogels as cell carriers has been suggested. In this study, two different hydrogels were examined (in vitro) as potential cell carriers for human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) intended for IVD transplantation. The aim was to investigate cell-survival and chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs when cultured in hydrogels Puramatrix® or Hydromatrix® and potential effects of stimulation with growth hormone (GH). hMSCs/hydrogel cultures were investigated for cell-viability, attachment, gene expression of chondrogenic markers SOX9, COL2A1, ACAN and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM). In both hydrogel types, hMSCs were viable for 28days, expressed integrin β1 which indicates adhesion of hMSCs. Differentiation was observed into chondrocyte-like cells, in a higher extent in hMSCs/Hydromatrix® cultures when compared to hMSCs/Puramatrix® hydrogel cultures. Gene expression analyses of chondrogenic markers verified results. hMSCs/hydrogel cultures stimulated with GH displayed no significant effects on chondrogenesis. In conclusion, both hydrogels, especially Hydromatrix® was demonstrated as a promising cell carrier in vitro for hMSCs, when directed into chondrogenesis. This knowledge could be useful in biological approaches for regeneration of degenerated human IVDs.

Abstract: It has been suggested that metastasis-associated proteins 1 and 2 (MTA1 and MTA2) are capable of suppressing estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) transactivation activity in breast cancer cells. ERα, which is present in the epididymis, is a crucial mediator of maintaining the luminal environment necessary for proper sperm maturation and function. The present study was undertaken to analyze the expression profile of both MTA1 and MTA2 in the epididymis of rats and to ascertain whether MTA1/2 colocalizes with ERα in the epididymis and primary cultured epididymal epithelial cells. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analyses were utilized to demonstrate that MTA1 and MTA2 are expressed in the epididymis. Furthermore, these analyses revealed that MTA1 and MTA2 are predominantly localized in the nuclei of almost all epididymal epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that MTA1/2 colocalizes with ERα in epididymal epithelial cells. In conclusion, MTA1 and MTA2 are expressed in the epididymis of rats; these proteins colocalize with ERα in epididymal epithelial cells, suggesting that MTA1 and MTA2 may be involved in the regulation of ERα transactivation activity in the epididymis of rats to facilitate a stable environment in the lumen.

Abstract: Summary
Recent work has shown that thalamocortical (TC) inputs can be plastic after the developmental critical period has closed, but the mechanism that enables re-establishment of plasticity is unclear. Here, we find that long-term potentiation (LTP) at TC inputs is transiently restored in spared barrel cortex following either a unilateral infra-orbital nerve (ION) lesion, unilateral whisker trimming, or unilateral ablation of the rodent barrel cortex. Restoration of LTP is associated with increased potency at TC input and reactivates anatomical map plasticity induced by whisker follicle ablation. The reactivation of TC LTP is accompanied by reappearance of silent synapses. Both LTP and silent synapse formation are preceded by transient re-expression of synaptic GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are required for the reappearance of TC plasticity. These results clearly demonstrate that peripheral sensory deprivation reactivates synaptic plasticity in the mature layer 4 barrel cortex with features similar to the developmental critical period.

Abstract: Summary
The action of DNA topoisomerase II (Top2) creates transient DNA breaks that are normally concealed inside Top2-DNA covalent complexes. Top2 poisons, including ubiquitously present natural compounds and clinically used anti-cancer drugs, trap Top2-DNA complexes. Here, we show that cells actively prevent Top2 degradation to avoid the exposure of concealed DNA breaks. A genome-wide screen revealed that fission yeast cells lacking Rrp2, an Snf2-family DNA translocase, are strongly sensitive to Top2 poisons. Loss of Rrp2 enhances SUMOylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of Top2, which in turn increases DNA damage at sites where Top2-DNA complexes are trapped. Rrp2 possesses SUMO-binding ability and prevents excessive Top2 degradation by competing against the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) for SUMO chain binding and by displacing SUMOylated Top2 from DNA. The budding yeast homolog of Rrp2, Uls1, plays a similar role, indicating that this genome protection mechanism is widely employed, a finding with implications for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Pat1 RNA-binding proteins, enriched in processing bodies (P bodies), are key players in cytoplasmic 5′ to 3′ mRNA decay, activating decapping of mRNA in complex with the Lsm1-7 heptamer. Using co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence approaches coupled with RNAi, we provide evidence for a nuclear complex of Pat1b with the Lsm2-8 heptamer, which binds to the spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Furthermore, we establish the set of interactions connecting Pat1b/Lsm2-8/U6 snRNA/SART3 and additional U4/U6.U5 tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (tri-snRNP) components in Cajal bodies, the site of snRNP biogenesis. RNA sequencing following Pat1b depletion revealed the preferential upregulation of mRNAs normally found in P bodies and enriched in 3′ UTR AU-rich elements. Changes in >180 alternative splicing events were also observed, characterized by skipping of regulated exons with weak donor sites. Our data demonstrate the dual role of a decapping enhancer in pre-mRNA processing as well as in mRNA decay via distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic Lsm complexes.

Abstract: Summary
GABAergic synapses in brain circuits generate inhibitory output signals with submillisecond latency and temporal precision. Whether the molecular identity of the release sensor contributes to these signaling properties remains unclear. Here, we examined the Ca2+ sensor of exocytosis at GABAergic basket cell (BC) to Purkinje cell (PC) synapses in cerebellum. Immunolabeling suggested that BC terminals selectively expressed synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2), whereas synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) was enriched in excitatory terminals. Genetic elimination of Syt2 reduced action potential-evoked release to ∼10%, identifying Syt2 as the major Ca2+ sensor at BC-PC synapses. Differential adenovirus-mediated rescue revealed that Syt2 triggered release with shorter latency and higher temporal precision and mediated faster vesicle pool replenishment than Syt1. Furthermore, deletion of Syt2 severely reduced and delayed disynaptic inhibition following parallel fiber stimulation. Thus, the selective use of Syt2 as release sensor at BC-PC synapses ensures fast and efficient feedforward inhibition in cerebellar microcircuits.

Abstract: Summary
One of the key research areas surrounding HIV-1 concerns the regulation of the fusion event that occurs between the virus particle and the host cell during entry. Even if it is universally accepted that the large GTPase dynamin-2 is important during HIV-1 entry, its exact role during the first steps of HIV-1 infection is not well characterized. Here, we have utilized a multidisciplinary approach to study the DNM2 role during fusion of HIV-1 in primary resting CD4 T and TZM-bl cells. We have combined advanced light microscopy and functional cell-based assays to experimentally assess the role of dynamin-2 during these processes. Overall, our data suggest that dynamin-2, as a tetramer, might help to establish hemi-fusion and stabilizes the pore during HIV-1 fusion.

Abstract: This study evaluated the effects of testosterone in the bulbourethral glands (BG) of the bat, Artibeus planirostris, by performing castration and posterior hormonal supplementation of the animals. The results showed a decrease in testosterone levels in animals 15days after castration, which induced a small reduction in epithelium height, percentage of AR+ cells, and an increase in the amount of basal cells. This reduction became more severe in groups castrated for longer periods (19 and 22days), where there was also an increase in apoptotic cells. Moreover, the hormonal supplementation increased testosterone levels (after 3 and 7days of supplementation), causing a glandular reactivation that increased the epithelium height and AR expression. In conclusion, BG took longer to respond to ablation of testosterone than other reproductive glands, since it showed evident aspects of regression only in animals 22days after castrated.

Abstract: Summary
Synthetic gene expression is highly sensitive to intragenic compositional context (promoter structure, spacing regions between promoter and coding sequences, and ribosome binding sites). However, much less is known about the effects of intergenic compositional context (spatial arrangement and orientation of entire genes on DNA) on expression levels in synthetic gene networks. We compare expression of induced genes arranged in convergent, divergent, or tandem orientations. Induction of convergent genes yielded up to 400% higher expression, greater ultrasensitivity, and dynamic range than divergent- or tandem-oriented genes. Orientation affects gene expression whether one or both genes are induced. We postulate that transcriptional interference in divergent and tandem genes, mediated by supercoiling, can explain differences in expression and validate this hypothesis through modeling and in vitro supercoiling relaxation experiments. Treatment with gyrase abrogated intergenic context effects, bringing expression levels within 30% of each other. We rebuilt the toggle switch with convergent genes, taking advantage of supercoiling effects to improve threshold detection and switch stability.

Abstract: Summary
Metal efflux pumps maintain ion homeostasis in the cell. The functions of the transporters are often supported by chaperone proteins, which scavenge the metal ions from the cytoplasm. Although the copper ion transporter CopA has been known in Escherichia coli, no gene for its chaperone had been identified. We show that the CopA chaperone is expressed in E. coli from the same gene that encodes the transporter. Some ribosomes translating copA undergo programmed frameshifting, terminate translation in the −1 frame, and generate the 70 aa-long polypeptide CopA(Z), which helps cells survive toxic copper concentrations. The high efficiency of frameshifting is achieved by the combined stimulatory action of a “slippery” sequence, an mRNA pseudoknot, and the CopA nascent chain. Similar mRNA elements are not only found in the copA genes of other bacteria but are also present in ATP7B, the human homolog of copA, and direct ribosomal frameshifting in vivo.

Abstract: The Na+/H+ exchanger is responsible for maintaining the acidic tumor microenvironment through its promotion of the reabsorption of extracellular Na+ and the extrusion of intracellular H+. The resultant increase in the extracellular acidity contributes to the chemoresistance of malignant tumors. In this study, the chemosensitizing effects of cariporide, a potent Na+/H+-exchange inhibitor, were evaluated in human malignant mesothelioma H-2452 cells preadapted with lactic acid. A higher basal level of phosphorylated (p)-AKT protein was found in the acid-tolerable H-2452AcT cells compared with their parental acid-sensitive H-2452 cells. When introduced in H-2452AcT cells with a concentration that shows only a slight toxicity in H-2452 cells, cariporide exhibited growth-suppressive and apoptosis-promoting activities, as demonstrated by an increase in the cells with pyknotic and fragmented nuclei, annexin V-PE(+) staining, a sub-G0/G1 peak, and a G2/M phase-transition delay in the cell cycle. Preceding these changes, a cariporide-induced p-AKT down-regulation, a p53 up-regulation, an ROS accumulation, and the depolarization of the mitochondrial-membrane potential were observed. A pretreatment with the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 markedly augmented the DNA damage caused by the cariporide, as indicated by a much greater extent of comet tails and a tail moment with increased levels of the p-histone H2A.X, p-ATMSer1981, p-ATRSer428, p-CHK1Ser345, and p-CHK2Thr68, as well as a series of pro-apoptotic events. The data suggest that an inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling is necessary to enhance the cytotoxicity toward the acid-tolerable H-2452AcT cells, and it underlines the significance of proton-pump targeting as a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome the acidic-microenvironment-associated chemotherapeutic resistance.

Abstract: Summary
During Caenorhabditis elegans oocyte meiosis, a multi-protein ring complex (RC) localized between homologous chromosomes, promotes chromosome congression through the action of the chromokinesin KLP-19. While some RC components are known, the mechanism of RC assembly has remained obscure. We show that SUMO E3 ligase GEI-17/PIAS is required for KLP-19 recruitment to the RC, and proteomic analysis identified KLP-19 as a SUMO substrate in vivo. In vitro analysis revealed that KLP-19 is efficiently sumoylated in a GEI-17-dependent manner, while GEI-17 undergoes extensive auto-sumoylation. GEI-17 and another RC component, the kinase BUB-1, contain functional SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs), allowing them to recruit SUMO modified proteins, including KLP-19, into the RC. Thus, dynamic SUMO modification and the presence of SIMs in RC components generate a SUMO-SIM network that facilitates assembly of the RC. Our results highlight the importance of SUMO-SIM networks in regulating the assembly of dynamic protein complexes.

Abstract: Summary
TET proteins, by converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), are hypothesized, but not directly shown, to protect promoter CpG islands (CGIs) against abnormal DNA methylation (DNAm) in cancer. We define such a protective role linked to DNA damage from oxidative stress (OS) known to induce this abnormality. TET2 removes aberrant DNAm during OS through interacting with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in a “Yin-Yang” complex targeted to chromatin and enhanced by p300 mediated TET2 acetylation. Abnormal gains of DNAm and 5hmC occur simultaneously in OS, and knocking down TET2 dynamically alters this balance by enhancing 5mC and reducing 5hmC. TET2 reduction results in hypermethylation of promoter CGIs and enhancers in loci largely overlapping with those induced by OS. Thus, TET2 indeed may protect against abnormal, cancer DNAm in a manner linked to DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancer activation is a critical step for gene activation. Here we report an epigenetic crosstalk at enhancers between the UTX (H3K27 demethylase)-MLL4 (H3K4 methyltransferase) complex and the histone acetyltransferase p300. We demonstrate that UTX, in a demethylase activity-independent manner, facilitates conversion of inactive enhancers in embryonic stem cells to an active (H3K4me1+/H3K27ac+) state by recruiting and coupling the enzymatic functions of MLL4 and p300. Loss of UTX leads to attenuated enhancer activity, characterized by reduced levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac as well as impaired transcription. The UTX-MLL4 complex enhances p300-dependent H3K27 acetylation through UTX-dependent stimulation of p300 recruitment, while MLL4-mediated H3K4 monomethylation, reciprocally, requires p300 function. Importantly, MLL4-generated H3K4me1 further enhances p300-dependent transcription. This work reveals a previously unrecognized cooperativity among enhancer-associated chromatin modulators, including a unique function for UTX, in establishing an “active enhancer landscape” and defines a detailed mechanism for the joint deposition of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages play pivotal roles in both the induction and resolution phases of inflammatory processes. Macrophages have been shown to synthesize anti-inflammatory fatty acids in an LXR-dependent manner, but whether the production of these species contributes to the resolution phase of inflammatory responses has not been established. Here, we identify a biphasic program of gene expression that drives production of anti-inflammatory fatty acids 12–24 hr following TLR4 activation and contributes to downregulation of mRNAs encoding pro-inflammatory mediators. Unexpectedly, rather than requiring LXRs, this late program of anti-inflammatory fatty acid biosynthesis is dependent on SREBP1 and results in the uncoupling of NFκB binding from gene activation. In contrast to previously identified roles of SREBP1 in promoting production of IL1β during the induction phase of inflammation, these studies provide evidence that SREBP1 also contributes to the resolution phase of TLR4-induced gene activation by reprogramming macrophage lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Animal behavior is, on the one hand, controlled by neuronal circuits that integrate external sensory stimuli and induce appropriate motor responses. On the other hand, stimulus-evoked or internally generated behavior can be influenced by motivational conditions, e.g., the metabolic state. Motivational states are determined by physiological parameters whose homeostatic imbalances are signaled to and processed within the brain, often mediated by modulatory peptides. Here, we investigate the regulation of appetitive and feeding behavior in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We report that four neurons in the fly brain that release SIFamide are integral elements of a complex neuropeptide network that regulates feeding. We show that SIFamidergic cells integrate feeding stimulating (orexigenic) and feeding suppressant (anorexigenic) signals to appropriately sensitize sensory circuits, promote appetitive behavior, and enhance food intake. Our study advances the cellular dissection of evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that convert peripheral metabolic signals into feeding-related behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Developing strategies that promote axonal regeneration within the injured CNS is a major therapeutic challenge, as axonal outgrowth is potently inhibited by myelin and the glial scar. Although regeneration can be achieved using the genetic deletion of PTEN, a negative regulator of the mTOR pathway, this requires inactivation prior to nerve injury, thus precluding therapeutic application. Here, we show that, remarkably, fibroblast-derived exosomes (FD exosomes) enable neurite growth on CNS inhibitory proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that, upon treatment with FD exosomes, Wnt10b is recruited toward lipid rafts and activates mTOR via GSK3β and TSC2. Application of FD exosomes shortly after optic nerve injury promoted robust axonal regeneration, which was strongly reduced in Wnt10b-deleted animals. This work uncovers an intercellular signaling pathway whereby FD exosomes mobilize an autocrine Wnt10b-mTOR pathway, thereby awakening the intrinsic capacity of neurons for regeneration, an important step toward healing the injured CNS.

Abstract: Summary
H4K20 monomethylation maintains genome integrity by regulating proper mitotic condensation, DNA damage response, and replication licensing. Here, we show that, in non-dividing hepatic cells, H4K20Me1 is specifically enriched in active gene bodies and dynamically regulated by the antagonistic action of Kmt5a methylase and Kdm7b demethylase. In liver-specific Kmt5a-deficient mice, reduced levels of H4K20Me1 correlated with reduced RNA Pol II release from promoter-proximal regions. Genes regulating glucose and fatty acid metabolism were most sensitive to impairment of RNA Pol II release. Downregulation of glycolytic genes resulted in an energy starvation condition partially compensated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and increased mitochondrial activity. This metabolic reprogramming generated a highly sensitized state that, upon different metabolic stress conditions, quickly aggravated into a senescent phenotype due to ROS overproduction-mediated oxidative DNA damage. The results illustrate how defects in the general process of RNA Pol II transition into a productive elongation phase can trigger specific metabolic changes and genome instability.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) offer unprecedented opportunities for disease modeling and personalized medicine. However, PSC-derived cells exhibit fetal-like characteristics and remain immature in a dish. This has emerged as a major obstacle for their application for late-onset diseases. We previously showed that there is a neonatal arrest of long-term cultured PSC-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs). Here, we demonstrate that PSC-CMs mature into adult CMs when transplanted into neonatal hearts. PSC-CMs became similar to adult CMs in morphology, structure, and function within a month of transplantation into rats. The similarity was further supported by single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. Moreover, this in vivo maturation allowed patient-derived PSC-CMs to reveal the disease phenotype of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which manifests predominantly in adults. This study lays a foundation for understanding human CM maturation and pathogenesis and can be instrumental in PSC-based modeling of adult heart diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has attracted considerable research interest because of its therapeutic potential to treat obesity and associated metabolic diseases. Augmentation of brown fat mass and/or its function may represent an attractive strategy to enhance energy expenditure. Using high-throughput phenotypic screening to induce brown adipocyte reprogramming in committed myoblasts, we identified a retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist, bexarotene (Bex), that efficiently converted myoblasts into brown adipocyte-like cells. Bex-treated mice exhibited enlarged BAT mass, enhanced BAT function, and a modest browning effect in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT). Expression analysis showed that Bex initiated several “browning” pathways at an early stage during brown adipocyte reprogramming. Our findings suggest RXRs as new master regulators that control brown and beige fat development and activation, unlike the common adipogenic regulator PPARγ. Moreover, we demonstrated that selective RXR activation may potentially offer a therapeutic approach to manipulate brown/beige fat function in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
ADP-ribosylation of proteins is emerging as an important regulatory mechanism. Depending on the family member, ADP-ribosyltransferases either conjugate a single ADP-ribose to a target or generate ADP-ribose chains. Here we characterize Parp9, a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase reported to be enzymatically inactive. Parp9 undergoes heterodimerization with Dtx3L, a histone E3 ligase involved in DNA damage repair. We show that the Dtx3L/Parp9 heterodimer mediates NAD+-dependent mono-ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin, exclusively in the context of ubiquitin processing by E1 and E2 enzymes. Dtx3L/Parp9 ADP-ribosylates the carboxyl group of Ub Gly76. Because Gly76 is normally used for Ub conjugation to substrates, ADP-ribosylation of the Ub carboxyl terminus precludes ubiquitylation. Parp9 ADP-ribosylation activity therefore restrains the E3 function of Dtx3L. Mutation of the NAD+ binding site in Parp9 increases the DNA repair activity of the heterodimer. Moreover, poly(ADP-ribose) binding to the Parp9 macrodomains increases E3 activity. Dtx3L heterodimerization with Parp9 enables NAD+ and poly(ADP-ribose) regulation of E3 activity.

Abstract: Summary
Malformations of the cerebral cortex (MCCs) are devastating developmental disorders. We report here that mice with embryonic neural stem-cell-specific deletion of Llgl1 (Nestin-Cre/Llgl1fl/fl), a mammalian ortholog of the Drosophila cell polarity gene lgl, exhibit MCCs resembling severe periventricular heterotopia (PH). Immunohistochemical analyses and live cortical imaging of PH formation revealed that disruption of apical junctional complexes (AJCs) was responsible for PH in Nestin-Cre/Llgl1fl/fl brains. While it is well known that cell polarity proteins govern the formation of AJCs, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. We show that LLGL1 directly binds to and promotes internalization of N-cadherin, and N-cadherin/LLGL1 interaction is inhibited by atypical protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of LLGL1, restricting the accumulation of AJCs to the basolateral-apical boundary. Disruption of the N-cadherin-LLGL1 interaction during cortical development in vivo is sufficient for PH. These findings reveal a mechanism responsible for the physical and functional connection between cell polarity and cell-cell adhesion machineries in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Phytocystatins (PhyCYSs) are plant-specific proteinaceous inhibitors that are implicated in protein turnover and stress responses. Here, we characterized a PhyCYS from Arabidopsis thaliana, which was designated AtCYS5. RT-qPCR analysis showed that the expression of AtCYS5 in germinating seeds was induced by heat stress (HS) and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Analysis of the expression of the β-glucuronidase reporter gene under the control of the AtCYS5 promoter showed that AtCYS5 expression during seed germination was induced by HS and ABA. Constitutive overexpression of AtCYS5 driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter led to enhanced HS tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis, which was characterized by higher fresh weight and root length compared to wild-type (WT) and knockout (cys5) plants grown under HS conditions. The HS tolerance of At-CYS5-overexpressing transgenic plants was associated with increased insensitivity to exogenous ABA during both seed germination and post-germination compared to WT and cys5. Although no HS elements were identified in the 5′-flanking region of AtCYS5, canonical ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) were detected. AtCYS5 was upregulated in ABA-treated protoplasts transiently co-expressing this gene and genes encoding bZIP ABRE-binding factors (ABFs and AREB3). In the absence of ABA, ABF1 and ABF3 directly bound to the ABREs in the AtCYS5 promoter, which activated the transcription of this gene in the presence of ABA. These results suggest that an ABA-dependent pathway plays a positive role in the HS-responsive expression of AtCYS5 during seed germination and post-germination growth.

Abstract: Summary
Hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene results in production of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins that may disrupt pre-mRNA splicing in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients. At present, the mechanisms underlying this mis-splicing are not understood. Here, we show that addition of proline-arginine (PR) and glycine-arginine (GR) toxic DPR peptides to nuclear extracts blocks spliceosome assembly and splicing, but not other types of RNA processing. Proteomic and biochemical analyses identified the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) as a major interactor of PR and GR peptides. In addition, U2 snRNP, but not other splicing factors, mislocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm both in C9ORF72 patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons and in HeLa cells treated with the toxic peptides. Bioinformatic studies support a specific role for U2-snRNP-dependent mis-splicing in C9ORF72 patient brains. Together, our data indicate that DPR-mediated dysfunction of U2 snRNP could account for as much as ∼44% of the mis-spliced cassette exons in C9ORF72 patient brains.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression burdens cells by consuming resources and energy. While numerous studies have investigated regulation of expression level, little is known about gene design elements that govern expression costs. Here, we ask how cells minimize production costs while maintaining a given protein expression level and whether there are gene architectures that optimize this process. We measured fitness of ∼14,000 E. coli strains, each expressing a reporter gene with a unique 5′ architecture. By comparing cost-effective and ineffective architectures, we found that cost per protein molecule could be minimized by lowering transcription levels, regulating translation speeds, and utilizing amino acids that are cheap to synthesize and that are less hydrophobic. We then examined natural E. coli genes and found that highly expressed genes have evolved more forcefully to minimize costs associated with their expression. Our study thus elucidates gene design elements that improve the economy of protein expression in natural and heterologous systems.

Abstract: Summary
The eukaryotic genome is organized within cells as chromatin. For proper information output, higher-order chromatin structures can be regulated dynamically. How such structures form and behave in various cellular processes remains unclear. Here, by combining super-resolution imaging (photoactivated localization microscopy [PALM]) and single-nucleosome tracking, we developed a nuclear imaging system to visualize the higher-order structures along with their dynamics in live mammalian cells. We demonstrated that nucleosomes form compact domains with a peak diameter of ∼160 nm and move coherently in live cells. The heterochromatin-rich regions showed more domains and less movement. With cell differentiation, the domains became more apparent, with reduced dynamics. Furthermore, various perturbation experiments indicated that they are organized by a combination of factors, including cohesin and nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Notably, we observed the domains during mitosis, suggesting that they act as building blocks of chromosomes and may serve as information units throughout the cell cycle.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer evolves through the emergence and selection of molecular alterations. Cancer genome profiling has revealed that specific events are more or less likely to be co-selected, suggesting that the selection of one event depends on the others. However, the nature of these evolutionary dependencies and their impact remain unclear. Here, we designed SELECT, an algorithmic approach to systematically identify evolutionary dependencies from alteration patterns. By analyzing 6,456 genomes from multiple tumor types, we constructed a map of oncogenic dependencies associated with cellular pathways, transcriptional readouts, and therapeutic response. Finally, modeling of cancer evolution shows that alteration dependencies emerge only under conditional selection. These results provide a framework for the design of strategies to predict cancer progression and therapeutic response.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we report proteomic analyses of 129 human cortical tissues to define changes associated with the asymptomatic and symptomatic stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Network analysis revealed 16 modules of co-expressed proteins, 10 of which correlated with AD phenotypes. A subset of modules overlapped with RNA co-expression networks, including those associated with neurons and astroglial cell types, showing altered expression in AD, even in the asymptomatic stages. Overlap of RNA and protein networks was otherwise modest, with many modules specific to the proteome, including those linked to microtubule function and inflammation. Proteomic modules were validated in an independent cohort, demonstrating some module expression changes unique to AD and several observed in other neurodegenerative diseases. AD genetic risk loci were concentrated in glial-related modules in the proteome and transcriptome, consistent with their causal role in AD. This multi-network analysis reveals protein- and disease-specific pathways involved in the etiology, initiation, and progression of AD.

Abstract: The mature spermatozoon of Sclerodistomum italicum is filiform, tapered at both ends and shows the following features: 2 axonemes of the 9+“1” pattern of the Trepaxonemata, mitochondrion, nucleus and parallel cortical microtubules. The specific features of the spermatozoon of S. italicum include the simultaneous presence of two types of extramembranous ornamentations, the presence of short cortical microtubules in the anterior part of the spermatozoon and the presence of only one bundle of cortical microtubules in the median part of the spermatozoon. Thus far these structures are known only in the Hemiuroidea. The presence of filamentous ornamentation in the anterior extremity of the spermatozoon has not previously been described in the Sclerodistomidae. Similar to spermatozoa of other hemiuroideans, S. italicum lack spine-like bodies described in spermatozoa of many digenean taxa. The posterior extremity of the spermatozoon exhibits the same ultrastructural characteristics typical of the Hemiuroidea.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are multiprotein channels connecting the nucleus with the cytoplasm. NPCs have been shown to have tissue-specific composition, suggesting that their function can be specialized. However, the physiological roles of NPC composition changes and their impacts on cellular processes remain unclear. Here we show that the addition of the Nup210 nucleoporin to NPCs during myoblast differentiation results in assembly of an Mef2C transcriptional complex required for efficient expression of muscle structural genes and microRNAs. We show that this NPC-localized complex is essential for muscle growth, myofiber maturation, and muscle cell survival and that alterations in its activity result in muscle degeneration. Our findings suggest that NPCs regulate the activity of functional gene groups by acting as scaffolds that promote the local assembly of tissue-specific transcription complexes and show how nuclear pore composition changes can be exploited to regulate gene expression at the nuclear periphery.

Abstract: Summary
The guanidyl moiety is a component of fundamental metabolites, including the amino acid arginine, the energy carrier creatine, and the nucleobase guanine. Curiously, reports regarding the importance of free guanidine in biology are sparse, and no biological receptors that specifically recognize this compound have been previously identified. We report that many members of the ykkC motif RNA, the longest unresolved riboswitch candidate, naturally sense and respond to guanidine. This RNA is found throughout much of the bacterial domain of life, where it commonly controls the expression of proteins annotated as urea carboxylases and multidrug efflux pumps. Our analyses reveal that these proteins likely function as guanidine carboxylases and guanidine transporters, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bacteria are capable of endogenously producing guanidine. These and related findings demonstrate that free guanidine is a biologically relevant compound, and several gene families that can alleviate guanidine toxicity exist.

Abstract: Summary
The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 (Ect2) has been implicated in cancer. However, it is not clear how Ect2 causes transformation and whether Ect2 is necessary for tumorigenesis in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that nuclear Ect2 GEF activity is required for Kras-Trp53 lung tumorigenesis in vivo and that Ect2-mediated transformation requires Ect2-dependent rDNA transcription. Ect2 activates rRNA synthesis by binding the nucleolar transcription factor upstream binding factor 1 (UBF1) on rDNA promoters and recruiting Rac1 and its downstream effector nucleophosmin (NPM) to rDNA. Protein kinase Cι (PKCι)-mediated Ect2 phosphorylation stimulates Ect2-dependent rDNA transcription. Thus, Ect2 regulates rRNA synthesis through a PKCι-Ect2-Rac1-NPM signaling axis that is required for lung tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Overcoming metabolic stress is a critical step in tumor growth. Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) generated from glucose and acetate uptake is important for histone acetylation and gene expression. However, how acetyl-CoA is produced under nutritional stress is unclear. We demonstrate here that glucose deprivation results in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) phosphorylation at S659, which exposed the nuclear localization signal of ACSS2 for importin α5 binding and nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, ACSS2 binds to transcription factor EB and translocates to lysosomal and autophagy gene promoter regions, where ACSS2 incorporates acetate generated from histone acetylation turnover to locally produce acetyl-CoA for histone H3 acetylation in these regions and promote lysosomal biogenesis, autophagy, cell survival, and brain tumorigenesis. In addition, ACSS2 S659 phosphorylation positively correlates with AMPK activity in glioma specimens and grades of glioma malignancy. These results underscore the significance of nuclear ACSS2-mediated histone acetylation in maintaining cell homeostasis and tumor development.

Abstract: Summary
Set2-mediated histone methylation at H3K36 regulates diverse activities, including DNA repair, mRNA splicing, and suppression of inappropriate (cryptic) transcription. Although failure of Set2 to suppress cryptic transcription has been linked to decreased lifespan, the extent to which cryptic transcription influences other cellular functions is poorly understood. Here, we uncover a role for H3K36 methylation in the regulation of the nutrient stress response pathway. We found that the transcriptional response to nutrient stress was dysregulated in SET2-deleted (set2Δ) cells and was correlated with genome-wide bi-directional cryptic transcription that originated from within gene bodies. Antisense transcripts arising from these cryptic events extended into the promoters of the genes from which they arose and were associated with decreased sense transcription under nutrient stress conditions. These results suggest that Set2-enforced transcriptional fidelity is critical to the proper regulation of inducible and highly regulated transcription programs.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in CEP290, a transition zone protein in primary cilia, cause diverse ciliopathies, including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and Joubert-syndrome and related disorders (JSRD). We examined cilia biogenesis and function in cells derived from CEP290-LCA and CEP290-JSRD patients. CEP290 protein was reduced in LCA fibroblasts with no detectable impact on cilia; however, optic cups derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of CEP290-LCA patients displayed less developed photoreceptor cilia. Lack of CEP290 in JSRD fibroblasts resulted in abnormal cilia and decreased ciliogenesis. We observed selectively reduced localization of ADCY3 and ARL13B. Notably, Hedgehog signaling was augmented in CEP290-JSRD because of enhanced ciliary transport of Smoothened and GPR161. These results demonstrate a direct correlation between the extent of ciliogenesis defects in fibroblasts and photoreceptors with phenotypic severity in JSRD and LCA, respectively, and strengthen the role of CEP290 as a selective ciliary gatekeeper for transport of signaling molecules in and out of the cilium.

Abstract: Summary
Tonotopy is a hallmark of auditory pathways and provides the basis for sound discrimination. Little is known about the involvement of transcription factors in brainstem cochlear neurons orchestrating the tonotopic precision of pre-synaptic input. We found that in the absence of Hoxa2 and Hoxb2 function in Atoh1-derived glutamatergic bushy cells of the anterior ventral cochlear nucleus, broad input topography and sound transmission were largely preserved. However, fine-scale synaptic refinement and sharpening of isofrequency bands of cochlear neuron activation upon pure tone stimulation were impaired in Hox2 mutants, resulting in defective sound-frequency discrimination in behavioral tests. These results establish a role for Hox factors in tonotopic refinement of connectivity and in ensuring the precision of sound transmission in the mammalian auditory circuit.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin remodelers use a helicase-like ATPase motor to reposition and reorganize nucleosomes along genomic DNA. Yet, how the ATPase motor communicates with other remodeler domains in the context of the nucleosome has so far been elusive. Here, we report for the Chd1 remodeler a unique organization of domains on the nucleosome that reveals direct domain-domain communication. Site-specific cross-linking shows that the chromodomains and ATPase motor bind to adjacent SHL1 and SHL2 sites, respectively, on nucleosomal DNA and pack against the DNA-binding domain on DNA exiting the nucleosome. This domain arrangement spans the two DNA gyres of the nucleosome and bridges both ends of a wrapped, ∼90-bp nucleosomal loop of DNA, suggesting a means for nucleosome assembly. This architecture illustrates how Chd1 senses DNA outside the nucleosome core and provides a basis for nucleosome spacing and directional sliding away from transcription factor barriers.

Abstract: Summary
Candida albicans can enter skeletal tissue through a skin wound in an immunocompromised host or by contamination during orthopedic surgery. Such Candida osteomyelitis is accompanied by severe pain and bone destruction. It is established that nociceptor innervation occurs in skin and bone, but the mechanisms of nociceptive modulation in fungal inflammation remain unclear. In this study, we show that C. albicans stimulates Nav1.8-positive nociceptors via the β-glucan receptor Dectin-1 to induce calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). This induction of CGRP is independent of Bcl-10 or Malt-1 but dependent on transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1)/transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1) ion channels. Hindpaw β-glucan injection after Nav1.8-positive nociceptor ablation or in TRPV1/TRPA1 deficiency showed dramatically increased osteoinflammation accompanied by impaired CGRP production. Strikingly, CGRP suppressed β-glucan-induced inflammation and osteoclast multinucleation via direct suppression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 by the transcriptional repressor Jdp2 and inhibition of actin polymerization, respectively. These findings clearly suggest a role for Dectin-1-mediated sensocrine pathways in the resolution of fungal osteoinflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Highly conserved intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein complexes direct both the assembly of primary cilia and the trafficking of signaling molecules. IFT complexes initially accumulate at the base of the cilium and periodically enter the cilium, suggesting an as-yet-unidentified mechanism that triggers ciliary entry of IFT complexes. Using affinity-purification and mass spectrometry of interactors of the centrosomal and ciliopathy protein, CEP19, we identify CEP350, FOP, and the RABL2B GTPase as proteins organizing the first known mechanism directing ciliary entry of IFT complexes. We discover that CEP19 is recruited to the ciliary base by the centriolar CEP350/FOP complex and then specifically captures GTP-bound RABL2B, which is activated via its intrinsic nucleotide exchange. Activated RABL2B then captures and releases its single effector, the intraflagellar transport B holocomplex, from the large pool of pre-docked IFT-B complexes, and thus initiates ciliary entry of IFT.

Abstract: Summary
Factors affecting the developing neonatal gut microbiome and immune networks may increase the risk of developing complex immune disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). In particular, peripartum antibiotics have been suggested as risk factors for human IBD, although direct evidence is lacking. Therefore, we examined the temporal impact of the commonly used antibiotic cefoperazone on both maternal and offspring microbiota when administered to dams during the peripartum period in the IL-10-deficient murine colitis model. By rigorously controlling for cage, gender, generational, and murine pathobiont confounders, we observed that offspring from cefoperazone-exposed dams develop a persistent gut dysbiosis into adulthood associated with skewing of the host immune system and increased susceptibility to spontaneous and chemically dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Thus, early life exposure to antibiotic-induced maternal dysbiosis during a critical developmental window for gut microbial assemblage and immune programming elicits a lasting impact of increased IBD risk on genetically susceptible offspring.

Abstract: Summary
Self-perpetuating ordered protein aggregates (amyloids and prions) are associated with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. Although environmental agents have been linked to certain amyloid diseases, the molecular basis of their action remains unclear. We have employed endogenous yeast prions as a model system to study environmental control of amyloid formation. A short-lived actin-associated yeast protein Lsb2 can trigger prion formation by other proteins in a mode regulated by the cytoskeleton and ubiquitin-dependent processes. Here, we show that such a heterologous prion induction is due to the ability of Lsb2 to form a transient prion state, generated in response to thermal stress. Evolutionary acquisition of prion-inducing activity by Lsb2 is traced to a single amino acid change, coinciding with the acquisition of thermotolerance in the Saccharomyces yeast lineage. This raises the intriguing possibility that the transient prion formation could aid in functioning of Lsb2 at higher temperatures.

Abstract: Summary
RNA can serve as a template for DNA double-strand break repair in yeast cells, and Rad52, a member of the homologous recombination pathway, emerged as an important player in this process. However, the exact mechanism of how Rad52 contributes to RNA-dependent DSB repair remained unknown. Here, we report an unanticipated activity of yeast and human Rad52: inverse strand exchange, in which Rad52 forms a complex with dsDNA and promotes strand exchange with homologous ssRNA or ssDNA. We show that in eukaryotes, inverse strand exchange between homologous dsDNA and RNA is a distinctive activity of Rad52; neither Rad51 recombinase nor the yeast Rad52 paralog Rad59 has this activity. In accord with our in vitro results, our experiments in budding yeast provide evidence that Rad52 inverse strand exchange plays an important role in RNA-templated DSB repair in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomal instability (CIN) contributes to cancer evolution, intratumor heterogeneity, and drug resistance. CIN is driven by chromosome segregation errors and a tolerance phenotype that permits the propagation of aneuploid genomes. Through genomic analysis of colorectal cancers and cell lines, we find frequent loss of heterozygosity and mutations in BCL9L in aneuploid tumors. BCL9L deficiency promoted tolerance of chromosome missegregation events, propagation of aneuploidy, and genetic heterogeneity in xenograft models likely through modulation of Wnt signaling. We find that BCL9L dysfunction contributes to aneuploidy tolerance in both TP53-WT and mutant cells by reducing basal caspase-2 levels and preventing cleavage of MDM2 and BID. Efforts to exploit aneuploidy tolerance mechanisms and the BCL9L/caspase-2/BID axis may limit cancer diversity and evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Amplification of 1q21 occurs in approximately 30% of de novo and 70% of relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) and is correlated with disease progression and drug resistance. Here, we provide evidence that the 1q21 amplification-driven overexpression of ILF2 in MM promotes tolerance of genomic instability and drives resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Mechanistically, elevated ILF2 expression exerts resistance to genotoxic agents by modulating YB-1 nuclear localization and interaction with the splicing factor U2AF65, which promotes mRNA processing and the stabilization of transcripts involved in homologous recombination in response to DNA damage. The intimate link between 1q21-amplified ILF2 and the regulation of RNA splicing of DNA repair genes may be exploited to optimize the use of DNA-damaging agents in patients with high-risk MM.

Abstract: Summary
T-box transcription factors T/Brachyury homolog A (Ta) and Tbx16 are essential for correct mesoderm development in zebrafish. The downstream transcriptional networks guiding their functional activities are poorly understood. Additionally, important contributions elsewhere are likely masked due to redundancy. Here, we exploit functional genomic strategies to identify Ta and Tbx16 targets in early embryogenesis. Surprisingly, we discovered they not only activate mesodermal gene expression but also redundantly regulate key endodermal determinants, leading to substantial loss of endoderm in double mutants. To further explore the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) governing endoderm formation, we identified targets of Ta/Tbx16-regulated homeodomain transcription factor Mixl1, which is absolutely required in zebrafish for endoderm formation. Interestingly, we find many endodermal determinants coordinately regulated through common genomic occupancy by Mixl1, Eomesa, Smad2, Nanog, Mxtx2, and Pou5f3. Collectively, these findings augment the endoderm GRN and reveal a panel of target genes underlying the Ta, Tbx16, and Mixl1 mutant phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic chromosomal DNA is faithfully replicated in a complex series of cell-cycle-regulated events that are incompletely understood. Here we report the reconstitution of DNA replication free in solution with purified proteins from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The system recapitulates regulated bidirectional origin activation; synthesis of leading and lagging strands by the three replicative DNA polymerases Pol α, Pol δ, and Pol ε; and canonical maturation of Okazaki fragments into continuous daughter strands. We uncover a dual regulatory role for chromatin during DNA replication: promoting origin dependence and determining Okazaki fragment length by restricting Pol δ progression. This system thus provides a functional platform for the detailed mechanistic analysis of eukaryotic chromosome replication.

Abstract: Regular monitoring on experimental animal management found the fluctuation of ART outcome, which showed a necessity to explore whether superovulation treatment is responsible for such unexpected outcome. This study was subsequently conducted to examine whether superovulation treatment can preserve ultrastructural integrity and developmental competence of oocytes following oocyte activation and embryo culture. A randomized study using mouse model was designed and in vitro development (experiment 1), ultrastructural morphology (experiment 2) and functional integrity of the oocytes (experiment 3) retrieved after PMSG/hCG injection (superovulation group) or not (natural ovulation; control group) were evaluated. In experiment 1, more oocytes were retrieved following superovulation than following natural ovulation, but natural ovulation yielded higher (p < 0.0563) maturation rate than superovulation. The capacity of mature oocytes to form pronucleus and to develop into blastocysts in vitro was similar. In experiment 2, a notable (p < 0.0186) increase in mitochondrial deformity, characterized by the formation of vacuolated mitochondria, was detected in the superovulation group. Multivesicular body formation was also increased, whereas early endosome formation was significantly decreased. No obvious changes in other microorganelles, however, were detected, which included the formation and distribution of mitochondria, cortical granules, microvilli, and smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum. In experiment 3, significant decreases in mitochondrial activity, ATP production and dextran uptake were detected in the superovulation group. In conclusion, superovulation treatment may change both maturational status and functional and ultrastuctural integrity of oocytes. Superovulation effect on preimplantation development can be discussed.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas systems are prokaryotic immune systems against invading nucleic acids. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems employ highly diverse, multi-subunit surveillance Cascade complexes that facilitate duplex formation between crRNA and complementary target DNA for R-loop formation, retention, and DNA degradation by the subsequently recruited nuclease Cas3. Typically, the large subunit recognizes bona fide targets through the PAM (protospacer adjacent motif), and the small subunit guides the non-target DNA strand. Here, we present the Apo- and target-DNA-bound structures of the I-Fv (type I-F variant) Cascade lacking the small and large subunits. Large and small subunits are functionally replaced by the 5′ terminal crRNA cap Cas5fv and the backbone protein Cas7fv, respectively. Cas5fv facilitates PAM recognition from the DNA major groove site, in contrast to all other described type I systems. Comparison of the type I-Fv Cascade with an anti-CRISPR protein-bound I-F Cascade reveals that the type I-Fv structure differs substantially at known anti-CRISPR protein target sites and might therefore be resistant to viral Cascade interception.

Abstract: Aim
The L-type voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.2 mediates the calcium influx into cells upon membrane depolarization. The list of cardiopathies associated to Cav1.2 dysfunctions highlights the importance of this channel in cardiac physiology. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK), expressed in cardiac cells, has been identified as a regulator of Cav2.2 channels in neurons, but no experiments have been performed to investigate its role in Cav1.2 regulation.
Methods and results
Full length or the distal C-terminal truncated of the pore-forming Cav1.2 channel (Cav1.2α1c), both present in cardiac cells, were expressed in TsA-201 cells. In addition, a shRNA silencer, or scramble as negative control, of CASK was co-transfected in order to silence CASK endogenously expressed. Three days post-transfection, the barium current was increased only for the truncated form without alteration of the steady state activation and inactivation biophysical properties. The calcium current, however, was increased after CASK silencing with both types of Cav1.2α1c subunits suggesting that, in absence of calcium, the distal C-terminal counteracts the CASK effect. Biochemistry experiments did not reveals neither an alteration of Cav1.2 channel protein expression after CASK silencing nor an interaction between Cav1.2α1c subunits and CASK. Nevertheless, after CASK silencing, single calcium channel recordings have shown an increase of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.2 open probability explaining the increase of the whole-cell current.
Conclusion
This study suggests CASK as a novel regulator of Cav1.2 via a modulation of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav1.2 open probability.
