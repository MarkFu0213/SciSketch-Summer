Abstract: Summary
Activation of dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinases 1A and 1B (DYRK1A and DYRK1B) requires prolyl hydroxylation by PHD1 prolyl hydroxylase. Prolyl hydroxylation of DYRK1 initiates a cascade of events leading to the release of molecular constraints on von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin ligase tumor suppressor function. However, the proline residue of DYRK1 targeted by hydroxylation and the role of prolyl hydroxylation in tyrosine autophosphorylation of DYRK1 are unknown. We found that a highly conserved proline in the CMGC insert of the DYRK1 kinase domain is hydroxylated by PHD1, and this event precedes tyrosine autophosphorylation. Mutation of the hydroxylation acceptor proline precludes tyrosine autophosphorylation and folding of DYRK1, resulting in a kinase unable to preserve VHL function and lacking glioma suppression activity. The consensus proline sequence is shared by most CMGC kinases, and prolyl hydroxylation is essential for catalytic activation. Thus, formation of prolyl-hydroxylated intermediates is a novel mechanism of kinase maturation and likely a general mechanism of regulation of CMGC kinases in eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear processing of most miRNAs is mediated by Microprocessor, comprised of RNase III enzyme Drosha and its cofactor DGCR8. Here, we uncover a hidden layer of Microprocessor regulation via studies of Dicer-independent mir-451, which is clustered with canonical mir-144. Although mir-451 is fully dependent on Drosha/DGCR8, its short stem and small terminal loop render it an intrinsically weak Microprocessor substrate. Thus, it must reside within a cluster for normal biogenesis, although the identity and orientation of its neighbor are flexible. We use DGCR8 tethering assays and operon structure-function assays to demonstrate that local recruitment and transfer of Microprocessor enhances suboptimal substrate processing. This principle applies more broadly since genomic analysis indicates suboptimal canonical miRNAs are enriched in operons, and we validate several of these experimentally. Proximity-based enhancement of suboptimal hairpin processing provides a rationale for genomic retention of certain miRNA operons and may explain preferential evolutionary emergence of miRNA operons.

Abstract: There is growing evidence indicating that the pore structure of voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) influences gating besides their conductance. Regarding low voltage-activated (LVA) Ca2+ channels, it has been demonstrated that substitutions of the pore aspartate (D) by a glutamate (D-to-E substitution) in domains III and IV alter channel gating properties such as a positive shift in the channel activation voltage dependence. In the present report, we evaluated the effects of E-to-D substitution in domains I and II on the CaV3.1 channel gating properties. Our results indicate that substitutions in these two domains differentially modify the gating properties of CaV3.1 channels. The channel with a single mutation in domain I (DEDD) presented slower activation and faster inactivation kinetics and a slower recovery from inactivation, as compared with the WT channel. In contrast, the single mutant in domain II (EDDD) presented a small but significant negative shift of activation voltage dependence with faster activation and slower inactivation kinetics. Finally, the double mutant channel (DDDD) presented somehow intermediate properties with respect to the two single mutants but with fastest deactivation kinetics. Overall, our results indicate that single amino acid modification of the selectivity filter of LVA Ca2+ channels in distinct domains differentially influence their gating properties, supporting a pore pseudo-symmetry.

Abstract: Summary
Selective assembly of influenza virus segments into virions is proposed to be mediated through intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions. Here, we developed a method called 2CIMPL that includes proximity ligation under native conditions to identify genome-wide RNA duplexes. Interactions between all eight segments were observed at multiple sites along a given segment and are concentrated at hotspots. Furthermore, synonymous nucleotide changes in a hotspot decreased the formation of RNA-RNA interactions at this site and resulted in a genome-wide rearrangement without a loss in replicative fitness. These results indicate that the viral RNA interaction network is flexible to account for nucleotide evolution. Moreover, comparative analysis of RNA-RNA interaction sites with viral nucleoprotein (NP) binding to the genome revealed that RNA junctions can also occur adjacent to NP peaks, suggesting that NP association does not exclude RNA duplex formation. Overall, 2CIMPL is a versatile technique to map in vivo RNA-RNA interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila development is governed by distinct ecdysone steroid pulses that initiate spatially and temporally defined gene expression programs. The translation of these signals into tissue-specific responses is crucial for metamorphosis, but the mechanisms that confer specificity to systemic ecdysone pulses are far from understood. Here, we identify Bric-à-brac 2 (Bab2) as an ecdysone-responsive transcriptional repressor that controls temporal gene expression during larval to pupal transition. Bab2 is necessary to terminate Salivary gland secretion (Sgs) gene expression, while premature Bab2 expression blocks Sgs genes and causes precocious salivary gland histolysis. The timely expression of bab2 is controlled by the ecdysone-responsive transcription factor Broad, and manipulation of EcR/USP/Broad signaling induces inappropriate Bab2 expression and termination of Sgs gene expression. Bab2 directly binds to Sgs loci in vitro and represses all Sgs genes in vivo. Our work characterizes Bab2 as a temporal regulator of somatic gene expression in response to systemic ecdysone signaling.

Abstract: This study investigated the delivery of S-nitrosothiol (GSNO) as a nitric oxide (NO) donor loaded into calcium carbonate-based mineralized nanoparticles (GSNO-MNPs) to regulate cell signaling pathways for the osteogenic differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). GSNO-MNPs were prepared by an anionic block copolymer template-mediated calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mineralization process in the presence of GSNO. GSNO-MNPs were spherical and had a narrow size distribution. GSNO was stably loaded within the MNPs without denaturation. TEM analysis also demonstrated the localization of GSNO-MNPs within membrane-bound structures in the cell, indicating the successful introduction of GSNO-MNPs into the cytosol of ESCs. Intracellular levels of NO and cGMP were significantly increased upon treatment with GSNO-MNPs, compared with the control group. When cells were exposed to GSNO-MNPs, the effects of nanoparticles on cell viability were not statistically significant. GSNO-MNPs treatment increased ALP activity assay and intracellular calcium levels. Real-time RT-PCR also revealed highly increased expression levels of the osteogenic target genes ALP, osteocalcin (OCN), and osterix (OSX) in GSNO-MNP-treated ESCs. The protein levels of OSX and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) showed similar patterns of expression based on real-time RT-PCR. These results indicate that GSNO-MNPs influenced the osteogenic differentiation of ESCs. Transcriptome profiling identified several significantly enriched and involved biological networks, such as RAP1, RAS, PI3K-AKT, and MAPK signaling pathways. These findings suggest that GSNO-MNPs can modulate osteogenic differentiation in ESCs via complex molecular pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing evidence suggests that tRNA levels are dynamically and specifically regulated in response to internal and external cues to modulate the cellular translational program. However, the molecular players and the mechanisms regulating the gene-specific expression of tRNAs are still unknown. Using an inducible auxin-degron system to rapidly deplete RPB1 (the largest subunit of RNA Pol II) in living cells, we identified Pol II as a direct gene-specific regulator of tRNA transcription. Our data suggest that Pol II transcription robustly interferes with Pol III function at specific tRNA genes. This activity was further found to be essential for MAF1-mediated repression of a large set of tRNA genes during serum starvation, indicating that repression of tRNA genes by Pol II is dynamically regulated. Hence, Pol II plays a direct and central role in the gene-specific regulation of tRNA expression.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling by the cytokine transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) has been implicated in a multitude of biological functions; however, TGF-β signaling, particularly in the CNS, remains largely unexplored. ANK3 variants (encoding ankyrin-G) are associated with bipolar disorder, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder, while mutations in USP9X, which encodes a deubiquitinase, are associated with X-linked intellectual disability and autism in humans. Here, we show that TGF-β signaling promotes Usp9X phosphorylation, which enhances its interaction with ankyrin-G and stabilizes ankyrin-G in spines, leading to spine enlargement. Using in situ proximity ligation combined with structured illumination superresolution microscopy, we characterize the postsynaptic spatial organization of phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Usp9X/ankyrin-G interactions in dendrites and its quantitative relationship with spine morphology and number. These data reveal a cytokine-mediated mechanism regulating protein stability in spines and suggest a role for deubiquitination and TGF-β signaling in neurodevelopmental disorder pathogenesis and treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in liver tissue damage and in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) initiation and progression. However, the mechanisms that regulate autophagy and metabolic reprogramming during reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and how ROS promote tumorigenesis, still need to be fully understood. We show that protein kinase C (PKC) λ/ι loss in hepatocytes promotes autophagy and oxidative phosphorylation. This results in ROS generation, which through NRF2 drives HCC through cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. Although PKCλ/ι promotes tumorigenesis in oncogene-driven cancer models, emerging evidence demonstrate that it is a tumor suppressor in more complex carcinogenic processes. Consistently, PKCλ/ι levels negatively correlate with HCC histological tumor grade, establishing this kinase as a tumor suppressor in liver cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon-inducible guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) promote cell-intrinsic defense through host cell death. GBPs target pathogens and pathogen-containing vacuoles and promote membrane disruption for release of microbial molecules that activate inflammasomes. GBP1 mediates pyroptosis or atypical apoptosis of Salmonella Typhimurium (STm)- or Toxoplasma gondii (Tg)- infected human macrophages, respectively. The pathogen-proximal detection-mechanisms of GBP1 remain poorly understood, as humans lack functional immunity-related GTPases (IRGs) that assist murine Gbps. Here, we establish that GBP1 promotes the lysis of Tg-containing vacuoles and parasite plasma membranes, releasing Tg-DNA. In contrast, we show GBP1 targets cytosolic STm and recruits caspase-4 to the bacterial surface for its activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but does not contribute to bacterial vacuole escape. Caspase-1 cleaves and inactivates GBP1, and a cleavage-deficient GBP1D192E mutant increases caspase-4-driven pyroptosis due to the absence of feedback inhibition. Our studies elucidate microbe-specific roles of GBP1 in infection detection and its triggering of the assembly of divergent caspase signaling platforms.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been exhaustively investigated during early pregnancy; however, their role later in gestation is poorly understood. Herein, we report that functional Tregs are reduced at the maternal-fetal interface in a subset of women with idiopathic preterm labor/birth, which is accompanied by a concomitant increase in Tc17 cells. In mice, depletion of functional Tregs during late gestation induces preterm birth and adverse neonatal outcomes, which are rescued by the adoptive transfer of such cells. Treg depletion does not alter obstetrical parameters in the mother, yet it increases susceptibility to endotoxin-induced preterm birth. The mechanisms whereby depletion of Tregs induces adverse perinatal outcomes involve tissue-specific immune responses and mild systemic maternal inflammation, together with dysregulation of developmental and cellular processes in the placenta, in the absence of intra-amniotic inflammation. These findings provide mechanistic evidence supporting a role for Tregs in the pathophysiology of idiopathic preterm labor/birth and adverse neonatal outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
BET bromodomain inhibitors (BBDIs) are candidate therapeutic agents for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and other cancer types, but inherent and acquired resistance to BBDIs limits their potential clinical use. Using CRISPR and small-molecule inhibitor screens combined with comprehensive molecular profiling of BBDI response and resistance, we identified synthetic lethal interactions with BBDIs and genes that, when deleted, confer resistance. We observed synergy with regulators of cell cycle progression, YAP, AXL, and SRC signaling, and chemotherapeutic agents. We also uncovered functional similarities and differences among BRD2, BRD4, and BRD7. Although deletion of BRD2 enhances sensitivity to BBDIs, BRD7 loss leads to gain of TEAD-YAP chromatin binding and luminal features associated with BBDI resistance. Single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and cellular barcoding analysis of BBDI responses in sensitive and resistant cell lines highlight significant heterogeneity among samples and demonstrate that BBDI resistance can be pre-existing or acquired.

Abstract: Calcium is a ubiquitous intracellular second messenger, playing central roles in the regulation of several biological processes. Alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling are an important feature of tumor cells to acquire proliferative and survival advantages, which include structural and functional changes in storage capacity, channels, and pumps. Here, we investigated the differences in Ca2+ homeostasis in vemurafenib-responsive and non-responsive melanoma cells. Also, the expression of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and the impact of its inhibition were studied. For this, it was used B-RAFV600E and NRASQ61R-mutated human melanoma cells. The intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM decreased the viability of SK-MEL-147 but not of SK-MEL-19 and EGTA sensitized NRASQ61R-mutated cells to vemurafenib. These cells also presented a smaller response to thapsargin and ionomycin regarding the cytosolic Ca2+ levels in relation to SK-MEL-19, which was associated to an increased expression of NCX1, NO basal levels, and sensitivity to NCX inhibitors. These data highlight the differences between B-RAFV600E and NRASQ61R-mutated melanoma cells in response to Ca2+ stimuli and point to the potential combination of clinically used chemotherapeutic drugs, including vemurafenib, with NCX inhibitors as a new therapeutic strategy to the treatment of melanoma.

Abstract: Summary
Southeast Asia has been the hotbed for the development of drug-resistant malaria parasites, including those with resistance to artemisinin combination therapy. While mutations in the kelch propeller domain (K13 mutations) are associated with artemisinin resistance, a range of evidence suggests that other factors are critical for the establishment and subsequent transmission of resistance in the field. Here, we perform a quantitative analysis of DNA damage and repair in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and find a strong link between enhanced DNA damage repair and artemisinin resistance. This experimental observation is further supported when variations in seven known DNA repair genes are found in resistant parasites, with six of these mutations being associated with K13 mutations. Our data provide important insights on confounding factors that are important for the establishment and spread of artemisinin resistance and may explain why resistance has not yet arisen in Africa.

Abstract: Summary
Pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGG) are frequently driven by genetic alterations in the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/MAPK) pathway yet show unexplained variability in their clinical outcome. To address this, we characterized a cohort of >1,000 clinically annotated pLGG. Eighty-four percent of cases harbored a driver alteration, while those without an identified alteration also often exhibited upregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. pLGG could be broadly classified based on their alteration type. Rearrangement-driven tumors were diagnosed at a younger age, enriched for WHO grade I histology, infrequently progressed, and rarely resulted in death as compared with SNV-driven tumors. Further sub-classification of clinical-molecular correlates stratified pLGG into risk categories. These data highlight the biological and clinical differences between pLGG subtypes and opens avenues for future treatment refinement.

Abstract: In this study we performed the comprehensive pharmacological analysis of two stereoisomers of 4-chloro-meta-cresol (4CMC), a popular ryanodine receptor (RyR) agonist used in muscle research. Experiments investigating the Ca2+-releasing action of the isomers demonstrated that the most potent isomer was 4-chloro-orto-cresol (4COC) (EC50 = 55 ± 14 μM), although 3-chloro-para-cresol (3CPC) was more effective, as it was able to induce higher magnitude of Ca2+ flux from isolated terminal cisterna vesicles. Nevertheless, 3CPC stimulated the hydrolytic activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ATP-ase (SERCA) with an EC50 of 91 ± 17 μM, while 4COC affected SERCA only in the millimolar range (IC50 = 1370 ± 88 μM). IC50 of 4CMC for SERCA pump was 167 ± 8 μM, indicating that 4CMC is not a specific RyR agonist either, as it activated RyR in a similar concentration (EC50 = 121 ± 20 μM). Our data suggest that the use of 4COC might be more beneficial than 4CMC in experiments, when Ca2+ release should be triggered through RyRs without influencing SERCA activity.

Abstract: Recent advances in imaging technology and fluorescent probes have made it possible to gain information about the dynamics of subcellular processes at unprecedented spatiotemporal scales. Unfortunately, a lack of automated tools to efficiently process the resulting imaging data encoding fine details of the biological processes remains a major bottleneck in utilizing the full potential of these powerful experimental techniques. Here we present a computational tool, called PunctaSpecks, that can characterize fluorescence signals arising from a wide range of biological molecules under normal and pathological conditions. Among other things, the program can calculate the number, areas, life-times, and amplitudes of fluorescence signals arising from multiple sources, track diffusing fluorescence sources like moving mitochondria, and determine the overlap probability of two processes or organelles imaged using indicator dyes of different colors. We have tested PunctaSpecks on synthetic time-lapse movies containing mobile fluorescence objects of various sizes, mimicking the activity of biomolecules. The robustness of the software is tested by varying the level of noise along with random but known pattern of appearing, disappearing, and movement of these objects. Next, we use PunctaSpecks to characterize protein-protein interaction involved in store-operated Ca2+ entry through the formation and activation of plasma membrane-bound ORAI1 channel and endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound stromal interaction molecule (STIM), the evolution of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ signals from sub-micrometer size local events into global waves in human cortical neurons, and the activity of Alzheimer’s disease-associated β amyloid pores in the plasma membrane. The tool can also be used to study other dynamical processes imaged through fluorescence molecules. The open source algorithm allows for extending the program to analyze more than two types of biomolecules visualized using markers of different colors.

Abstract: Summary
To understand gene function, the encoding DNA or mRNA transcript can be manipulated and the consequences observed. However, these approaches do not have a direct effect on the protein product of the gene, which is either permanently abrogated or depleted at a rate defined by the half-life of the protein. We therefore developed a single-component system that could induce the rapid degradation of the specific endogenous protein itself. A construct combining the RING domain of ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 with a protein-specific camelid nanobody mediates target destruction by the ubiquitin proteasome system, a process we describe as antibody RING-mediated destruction (ARMeD). The technique is highly specific because we observed no off-target protein destruction. Furthermore, bacterially produced nanobody-RING fusion proteins electroporated into cells induce degradation of target within minutes. With increasing availability of protein-specific nanobodies, this method will allow rapid and specific degradation of a wide range of endogenous proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are believed to have more distinct vulnerabilities than the bulk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, but their rarity and the lack of universal markers for their prospective isolation hamper their study. We report that genetically clonal induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from an AML patient and characterized by exceptionally high engraftment potential give rise, upon hematopoietic differentiation, to a phenotypic hierarchy. Through fate-tracking experiments, xenotransplantation, and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify a cell fraction (iLSC) that can be isolated prospectively by means of adherent in vitro growth that resides on the apex of this hierarchy and fulfills the hallmark features of LSCs. Through integrative genomic studies of the iLSC transcriptome and chromatin landscape, we derive an LSC gene signature that predicts patient survival and uncovers a dependency of LSCs, across AML genotypes, on the RUNX1 transcription factor. These findings can empower efforts to therapeutically target AML LSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Acidic transcription activation domains (ADs) are encoded by a wide range of seemingly unrelated amino acid sequences, making it difficult to recognize features that promote their dynamic behavior, “fuzzy” interactions, and target specificity. We screened a large set of random 30-mer peptides for AD function in yeast and trained a deep neural network (ADpred) on the AD-positive and -negative sequences. ADpred identifies known acidic ADs within transcription factors and accurately predicts the consequences of mutations. Our work reveals that strong acidic ADs contain multiple clusters of hydrophobic residues near acidic side chains, explaining why ADs often have a biased amino acid composition. ADs likely use a binding mechanism similar to avidity where a minimum number of weak dynamic interactions are required between activator and target to generate biologically relevant affinity and in vivo function. This mechanism explains the basis for fuzzy binding observed between acidic ADs and targets.

Abstract: We have investigated the involvement of the pre-mRNA processing factor 4B (PRP4) kinase domain in mediating drug resistance. HCT116 cells were treated with curcumin, and apoptosis was assessed based on flow cytometry and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cells were then transfected with PRP4 or pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 8 (PRP8), and drug resistance was analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we deleted the kinase domain in PRP4 using GatewayTM technology. Curcumin induced cell death through the production of ROS and decreased the activation of survival signals, but PRP4 overexpression reversed the curcumin-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. PRP8 failed to reverse the curcumin-induced apoptosis in the HCT116 colon cancer cell line. In xenograft mouse model experiments, curcumin effectively reduced tumour size whereas PRP4 conferred resistance to curcumin, which was evident from increasing tumour size, while PRP8 failed to regulate the curcumin action. PRP4 overexpression altered the morphology, rearranged the actin cytoskeleton, triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and decreased the invasiveness of HCT116 cells. The loss of E-cadherin, a hallmark of EMT, was observed in HCT116 cells overexpressing PRP4. Moreover, we observed that the EMT-inducing potential of PRP4 was aborted after the deletion of its kinase domain. Collectively, our investigations suggest that the PRP4 kinase domain is responsible for promoting drug resistance to curcumin by inducing EMT. Further evaluation of PRP4-induced inhibition of cell death and PRP4 kinase domain interactions with various other proteins might lead to the development of novel approaches for overcoming drug resistance in patients with colon cancer.

Abstract: While debate continues over whether somatosensory information is transmitted via labeled line, population coding, frequency coding, or some combination therein, researchers have begun to address this question at the level of the primary afferent by using optical approaches that enable the assessment of neural activity in hundreds to even thousands of neurons simultaneously. However, with limited availability of tools to optically assess electrical activity in large populations of neurons, researchers have turned to genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) including GCaMP to enable the detection of increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations as a correlate for neuronal activity. One of the most widely used GECIs is GCaMP6, which is available in three different versions tuned for sensitivity (GCaMP6s), speed (GCaMP6f), or a balance of the two (GCaMP6m). In order to determine if these issues were unique to GCaMP6 itself, or if they were inherent to more than one generation of GCaMP, we also characterized jGCaMP7. In the present study, we sought to determine the utility of the three GCaMP6 isoforms to detect changes in activity in primary afferents at frequencies ranging from 0.1–30 Hz. Given the heterogeneity of sensory neurons, we also compared the performance of each GCaMP6 isoform in subpopulations of neurons defined by properties used to identify putative nociceptive afferents: cell body size, isolectin B4 (IB4) binding, and capsaicin sensitivity. Finally, we compared results generated with GCaMP6 with that generated from neurons expressing the next generation of GCaMP, jGCaMP7s and jGCaMP7f. A viral approach, with AAV9-CAG-GCaMP6s/m/f, was used to drive GECI expression in acutely dissociated rat trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons, and neural activity was driven by electrical field stimulation. Infection efficiency with the AAV serotype was high >95 %, and the impact of GCaMP6 expression in TG neurons over the period of study (<10 days) on the regulation of intracellular Ca2+, as assessed with fura-2, was minimal. Having confirmed that the field stimulation evoked Ca2+ transients were dependent on Ca2+ influx secondary to the activation of action potentials and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, we also confirmed that the signal-to-noise ratio for each of the isoforms was excellent, enabling detection of a single spike in>90% of neurons. However, the utility of the GCaMP6 isoforms to enable an assessment of the firing frequency let alone changes in firing frequency of each neuron was relatively limited and isoform specific: GCaMP6s and 6m had the lowest resolution, enabling detection of spikes at 3 Hz in 15% and 32% of neurons respectively, but it was possible to resolve discrete single spikes up to 10 Hz in 36% of GCaMP6f neurons. Unfortunately, using other parameters of the Ca2+ transient, such as magnitude of the transient or the rate of rise, did not improve the range over which these indicators could be used to assess changes in spike number or firing frequency. Furthermore, in the presence of ongoing neural activity, it was even more difficult to detect a change in firing frequency. The frequency response relationship for the increase in Ca2+ was highly heterogeneous among sensory neurons and was influenced by both the GCaMP6 isoform used to assess it, the timing between the delivery of stimulation trains (inter-burst interval), and afferent subpopulation. Notably, the same deficiencies were observed with jGCaMP7s and 7f in resolving the degree of activity as were present for the GCaMP6 isoforms. Together, these data suggest that while both GCaMP6 and jGCaMP7 are potentially useful tools in sensory neurons to determine the presence or absence of neural activity, the ability to discriminate changes in firing frequency ≥ 3 Hz is extremely limited. As a result, GECIs should probably not be used in sensory neurons to assess changes in activity within or between subpopulations of neurons.

Abstract: Summary
During mammalian meiotic prophase I, programmed DNA double-strand breaks are repaired by non-crossover or crossover events, the latter predominantly occurring via the class I crossover pathway and requiring the cyclin N-terminal domain-containing 1(CNTD1) protein. Using an epitope-tagged Cntd1 allele, we detect a short isoform of CNTD1 in vivo that lacks a predicted N-terminal cyclin domain and does not bind cyclin-dependent kinases. Instead, we find that the short-form CNTD1 variant associates with components of the replication factor C (RFC) machinery to facilitate crossover formation, and with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, CDC34, to regulate ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of the WEE1 kinase, thereby modulating cell-cycle progression. We propose that these interactions facilitate a role for CNTD1 as a stop-go regulator during prophase I, ensuring accurate and complete crossover formation before allowing metaphase progression and the first meiotic division.

Abstract: While the growth factors like insulin initiate a signaling cascade to induce conformational changes in the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), amino acids cause the complex to localize to the site of activation, the lysosome. The precise mechanism of how mTORC1 moves in and out of the lysosome is yet to be elucidated in detail. Here we report that microtubules and the motor protein KIF11 are required for the proper dissociation of mTORC1 from the lysosome upon amino acid scarcity. When microtubules are disrupted or KIF11 is knocked down, we observe that mTORC1 localizes to the lysosome even in the amino acid-starved situation where it should be dispersed in the cytosol, causing an elevated mTORC1 activity. Moreover, in the mechanistic perspective, we discover that mTORC1 interacts with KIF11 on the motor domain of KIF11, enabling the complex to move out of the lysosome along microtubules. Our results suggest not only a novel way of the regulation regarding amino acid availability for mTORC1, but also a new role of KIF11 and microtubules in mTOR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Importin-α adaptor proteins orchestrate dynamic nuclear transport processes involved in cellular homeostasis. Here, we show that importin-α3, one of the main NF-κB transporters, is the most abundantly expressed classical nuclear transport factor in the mammalian respiratory tract. Importin-α3 promoter activity is regulated by TNF-α-induced NF-κB in a concentration-dependent manner. High-level TNF-α-inducing highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses (HPAIVs) isolated from fatal human cases harboring human-type polymerase signatures (PB2 627K, 701N) significantly downregulate importin-α3 mRNA expression in primary lung cells. Importin-α3 depletion is restored upon back-mutating the HPAIV polymerase into an avian-type signature (PB2 627E, 701D) that can no longer induce high TNF-α levels. Importin-α3-deficient mice show reduced NF-κB-activated antiviral gene expression and increased influenza lethality. Thus, importin-α3 plays a key role in antiviral immunity against influenza. Lifting the bottleneck in importin-α3 availability in the lung might provide a new strategy to combat respiratory virus infections.

Abstract: Summary
Kinetochores are multi-protein machines that form dynamic attachments to microtubules and control chromosome segregation. High fidelity is ensured because kinetochores can monitor attachment status and tension, using this information to activate checkpoints and error-correction mechanisms. To explore how kinetochores achieve this, we used two- and three-color subpixel fluorescence localization to define how proteins from six major complexes (CCAN, MIS12, NDC80, KNL1, RZZ, and SKA) and the checkpoint proteins Bub1, Mad1, and Mad2 are organized in the human kinetochore. This reveals how the outer kinetochore has a high nematic order and is largely invariant to the loss of attachment or tension, except for two mechanical sensors. First, Knl1 unravels to relay tension, and second, NDC80 undergoes jackknifing and loss of nematic order under microtubule detachment, with only the latter wired up to the checkpoint signaling system. This provides insight into how kinetochores integrate mechanical signals to promote error-free chromosome segregation.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons face unique transport challenges. They need to deliver cargo over long axonal distances and to many presynaptic nerve terminals. Rab GTPases are master regulators of vesicular traffic, but essential presynaptic Rabs have not been identified. Here, we find that Rab6, a Golgi-derived GTPase for constitutive secretion, associates with mobile axonal cargo and localizes to nerve terminals. ELKS1 is a stationary presynaptic protein with Golgin homology that binds to Rab6. Knockout and rescue experiments for ELKS1 and Rab6 establish that ELKS1 captures Rab6 cargo. The ELKS1-Rab6-capturing mechanism can be transferred to mitochondria by mistargeting ELKS1 or Rab6 to them. We conclude that nerve terminals have repurposed mechanisms from constitutive exocytosis for their highly regulated secretion. By employing Golgin-like mechanisms with anchored ELKS extending its coiled-coils to capture Rab6 cargo, they have spatially separated cargo capture from fusion. ELKS complexes connect to active zones and may mediate vesicle progression toward release sites.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cells are characterized by unlimited proliferation and perturbed differentiation. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that tumor cells in medulloblastoma (MB) retain their capacity to differentiate in a similar way as their normal originating cells, cerebellar granule neuron precursors. Once they differentiate, MB cells permanently lose their proliferative capacity and tumorigenic potential. Differentiated MB cells highly express NeuroD1, a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and forced expression of NeuroD1 promotes the differentiation of MB cells. The expression of NeuroD1 in bulk MB cells is repressed by trimethylation of histone 3 lysine-27 (H3K27me3). Inhibition of the histone lysine methyltransferase EZH2 prevents H3K27 trimethylation, resulting in increased NeuroD1 expression and enhanced differentiation in MB cells, which consequently reduces tumor growth. These studies reveal the mechanisms underlying MB cell differentiation and provide rationales to treat MB (potentially other malignancies) by stimulating tumor cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Lineage tracing aims to identify the progeny of a defined population of dividing progenitor cells, a daunting task in the developing central nervous system where thousands of cell types are generated. In mice, lineage analysis has been accomplished using Cre recombinase to indelibly label a defined progenitor population and its progeny. However, the interpretation of historical recombination events is hampered by the fact that driver genes are often expressed in both progenitors and postmitotic cells. Genetically inducible approaches provide temporal specificity but are afflicted by mosaicism and toxicity. Here, we present PRISM, a progenitor-restricted intersectional fate mapping approach in which Flp recombinase expression is both dependent on Cre and restricted to neural progenitors, thus circumventing the aforementioned confounds. This tool can be used in conjunction with existing Cre lines making it broadly applicable. We applied PRISM to resolve two developmentally important, but contentious, lineages—Shh and Cux2.

Abstract: Summary
Cell growth is coupled to cell-cycle progression in mitotically proliferating mammalian cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. CyclinD-Cdk4/6 is known to phosphorylate RB to promote S-phase entry, but recent work suggests they have additional functions. We show here that CyclinD-Cdk4/6 activates mTORC1 by binding and phosphorylating TSC2 on Ser1217 and Ser1452. Pharmacological inhibition of Cdk4/6 leads to a rapid, TSC2-dependent reduction of mTORC1 activity in multiple human and mouse cell lines, including breast cancer cells. By simultaneously driving mTORC1 and E2F, CyclinD-Cdk4/6 couples cell growth to cell-cycle progression. Consistent with this, we see that mTORC1 activity is cell cycle dependent in proliferating neural stem cells of the adult rodent brain. We find that Cdk4/6 inhibition reduces cell proliferation partly via TSC2 and mTORC1. This is of clinical relevance, because Cdk4/6 inhibitors are used for breast cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
As current therapies benefit only a minority of cancer patients, additional therapeutic targets are needed. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have attracted attention for improving therapeutic responses, yet regulatory strategies remain elusive. Here, we show that the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA-C) acts as a molecular switch, inducing a pro-tumoral immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype within tumors. In human and murine breast cancer, overactivated PKA in TAMs creates a detrimental microenvironment for cancer progression by inducing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and macrophage-derived arginase 1 (ARG1) expression. Macrophages with genetic deletion of PKA-C are prone to be pro-inflammatory, suggesting a possible immunotherapeutic target. Delivery of liposomal PKA inhibitor facilitates tumor regression and abrogates pro-tumoral TAM functions in mice. The therapeutic effect of targeting PKA is pronounced when combined with αCTLA-4 antibody, increasing cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+GranzymeB+ T cells by about 60-fold. Our findings demonstrate critical roles of TAM PKA-C in tumor progression and suggest that targeting PKA-C efficiently augments cancer treatment responses.

Abstract: Summary
Myelofibrosis is a severe myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by increased numbers of abnormal bone marrow megakaryocytes that induce fibrosis, destroying the hematopoietic microenvironment. To determine the cellular and molecular basis for aberrant megakaryopoiesis in myelofibrosis, we performed single-cell transcriptome profiling of 135,929 CD34+ lineage− hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), single-cell proteomics, genomics, and functional assays. We identified a bias toward megakaryocyte differentiation apparent from early multipotent stem cells in myelofibrosis and associated aberrant molecular signatures. A sub-fraction of myelofibrosis megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs) are transcriptionally similar to healthy-donor MkPs, but the majority are disease specific, with distinct populations expressing fibrosis- and proliferation-associated genes. Mutant-clone HSPCs have increased expression of megakaryocyte-associated genes compared to wild-type HSPCs, and we provide early validation of G6B as a potential immunotherapy target. Our study paves the way for selective targeting of the myelofibrosis clone and illustrates the power of single-cell multi-omics to discover tumor-specific therapeutic targets and mediators of tissue fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master modulator of cellular growth, and its aberrant regulation is recurrently documented within breast cancer. While the small GTPase Rheb1 is the canonical activator of mTORC1, Rheb1-independent mechanisms of mTORC1 activation have also been reported but have not been fully understood. Employing multiple transgenic mouse models of breast cancer, we report that ablation of Rheb1 significantly impedes mammary tumorigenesis. In the absence of Rheb1, a block in tumor initiation can be overcome by multiple independent mutations in Mtor to allow Rheb1-independent reactivation of mTORC1. We further demonstrate that the mTOR kinase is indispensable for tumor initiation as the genetic ablation of mTOR abolishes mammary tumorigenesis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that mTORC1 activation is indispensable for mammary tumor initiation and that tumors acquire alternative mechanisms of mTORC1 activation.

Abstract: Summary
Algorithms that accurately predict gene structure from primary sequence alone were transformative for annotating the human genome. Can we also predict the expression levels of genes based solely on genome sequence? Here, we sought to apply deep convolutional neural networks toward that goal. Surprisingly, a model that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability explains 59% and 71% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, respectively. This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity. Looking forward, we propose cell-type-specific gene-expression predictions based solely on primary sequences as a grand challenge for the field.

Abstract: The constant exposure of ocular surface to external environment and then to several microbial agents is often related to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory eye disorders. In the present study α-Smooth Muscle Actin (α-SMA) and Langerin CD/207 expression and function was investigated in a rabbit corneal keratitis. The inflammation was induced by the secreted form of glycoprotein B (gB1s) of HSV-1, in an ex vivo rabbit corneal model. α-SMA is often used as a marker for myofibroblasts. In this study, for the first time, we show α-SMA positive corneal epithelial cells, during HSV-1 cornea inflammation, demonstrating a crucial role in wound healing, especially during remodeling phase. Furthermore, we show the presence of Dendritic Cells Langerin CD/207 positive, located mainly in the basal epithelial layer and in corneal stroma during the inflammatory processes. Our result validating the ex vivo organotypic rabbit corneal model, for the study about pathogenesis of HSV-1 ocular infection.

Abstract: Summary
UHRF1 is a key regulator in DNA methylation maintenance. It binds histone H3K9me2/3 and hemi-methylated DNA and recruits DNMT1 to DNA replication forks during S phase. However, the regulatory mechanism of hemi-methylated DNA binding activity of UHRF1 remains unknown. In this study, we reveal that acetylation of UHRF1 is regulated by PCAF and HDAC1. We show that UHRF1 acetylation at K490 attenuates its binding affinity to hemi-methylated DNA. We analyze genome-wide DNA methylation and gene-expression patterns using stable cell lines and discover that cells where the endogenous UHRF1 is replaced with an acetyl-mimetic (UHRF1 K490Q) mutant show deficiencies in inherited DNA methylation and show different gene-expression patterns in genes related to cell survival. These results reveal that precise regulation of UHRF1 acetylation is required to maintain DNA methylation during cell division and control cell survival.

Abstract: Summary
To better understand the health benefits of lifelong exercise in humans, we conduct global skeletal muscle transcriptomic analyses of long-term endurance- (9 men, 9 women) and strength-trained (7 men) humans compared with age-matched untrained controls (7 men, 8 women). Transcriptomic analysis, Gene Ontology, and genome-scale metabolic modeling demonstrate changes in pathways related to the prevention of metabolic diseases, particularly with endurance training. Our data also show prominent sex differences between controls and that these differences are reduced with endurance training. Additionally, we compare our data with studies examining muscle gene expression before and after a months-long training period in individuals with metabolic diseases. This analysis reveals that training shifts gene expression in individuals with impaired metabolism to become more similar to our endurance-trained group. Overall, our data provide an extensive examination of the accumulated transcriptional changes that occur with decades-long training and identify important “exercise-responsive” genes that could attenuate metabolic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Attenuated DNA repair leads to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. BRCA1/BARD1 are the best-known tumor suppressors that promote homology recombination (HR) and arrest cell cycle. However, it remains ambiguous whether and how their E3 ligase activity regulates HR. Here, we demonstrate that upon genotoxic stress, BRCA1 together with BARD1 catalyzes the K48 polyubiquitination on LARP7, a 7SK RNA binding protein known to control RNAPII pausing, and thereby degrades it through the 26S ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Depleting LARP7 suppresses the expression of CDK1 complex, arrests the cell at the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, and reduces BRCA2 phosphorylation, which thereby facilitates RAD51 recruitment to damaged DNA to enhance HR. Importantly, LARP7 depletion observed in breast cancer patients leads to chemoradiotherapy resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, this study unveils a mechanism by which BRCA1/BARD1 control HR and cell cycle, and highlights LARP7 as a potential target for cancer prevention and therapy.

Abstract: Summary
NF-κB is a transcription factor that activates super enhancers (SEs) and typical enhancers (TEs) and triggers threshold and graded gene expression, respectively. However, the mechanisms by which NF-κB selectively participates in these enhancers remain unclear. Here we show using mouse primary B lymphocytes that SE activity simultaneously associates with chromatin opening and enriched NF-κB binding, resulting in a higher fold change and threshold expression upon B cell receptor (BCR) activation. The higher fold change results from longer DNA, whereas the threshold response is explained by synergy in DNA-NF-κB binding and is supported by the coexistence of PU.1 and NF-κB in a SE before cell stimulation. This model indicates that the pre-existing NF-κB functions as a seed and triggers its processive binding upon BCR activation. Our mathematical modeling of the single-cell transcriptome reveals an additional role for SEs in divergent clonal responses in B cells.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a major health problem worldwide affecting millions of people and is a result of neurodegeneration in a small part of the brain known as substantia nigra pars compacta. Aberration in mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis plays, among several other factors, an important role for the neuronal loss in PD. Mitochondria are vital for cellular physiology, e.g. for ATP generation, and mitochondrial Ca2+ is a key player in cell functioning and survival. Mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis is maintained by a fine balance between the activities of proteins mediating the influx and efflux of Ca2+ across mitochondrial membranes. Malfunctioning of these proteins leading to Ca2+ overload promotes ROS generation, which induces cell death by triggering the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Till now PD remains incurable and the “gold standard” drug which can only delays the disease progression is l-Dopa from the 1960s and therefore, the situation warrants the search for novel targets for the treatment of the PD patients. In this review, we summarize the current views that suggest mitochondrial Ca2+ regulatory pathways are good candidates for the treatment of PD.

Abstract: Summary
Ovulation is triggered by the gonadotropin surge that induces the expression of two key genes, progesterone receptor (Pgr) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), in the granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles. Their gene products PGR and PTGS2 activate two separate pathways that are both essential for successful ovulation. Here, we show that the PGR plays an additional essential role: it attenuates ovulatory inflammation by diminishing the gonadotropin surge-induced Ptgs2 expression. PGR indirectly terminates Ptgs2 expression and PGE2 synthesis in granulosa cells by inhibiting the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor required for Ptgs2 expression. When the expression of PGR is ablated in granulosa cells, the ovary undergoes a hyperinflammatory condition manifested by excessive PGE2 synthesis, immune cell infiltration, oxidative damage, and neoplastic transformation of ovarian cells. The PGR-driven termination of PTGS2 expression may protect the ovary from ovulatory inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
β-glucan is a potent inducer of epigenetic and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells, a process called “trained immunity,” resulting in an enhanced host response against secondary infections. We investigate whether β-glucan exposure confers protection against pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. β-glucan induces trained immunity via histone modifications at gene promoters in human monocytes, which is accompanied by the enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines upon secondary Mtb challenge and inhibition of Mtb growth. Mice treated with β-glucan are significantly protected against pulmonary Mtb infection, which is associated with the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow and increased myelopoiesis. The protective signature of β-glucan is mediated via IL-1 signaling, as β-glucan shows no protection in mice lacking a functional IL-1 receptor (IL1R−/−). The administration of β-glucan may be used as a novel strategy in the treatment of mycobacterial infections and possibly as an adjuvant to improve anti-tuberculosis vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we show that β adrenergic signaling coordinately upregulates de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and thermogenesis in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT), and both effects are blocked in mice lacking the cAMP-generating G protein-coupled receptor Gs (Adipo-GsαKO) in adipocytes. However, UCP1 expression but not DNL activation requires rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1. Furthermore, β3-adrenergic agonist CL316243 readily upregulates thermogenic but not lipogenic genes in cultured adipocytes, indicating that additional regulators must operate on DNL in sWAT in vivo. We identify one such factor as thyroid hormone T3, which is elevated locally by adrenergic signaling. T3 administration to wild-type mice enhances both thermogenesis and DNL in sWAT. Mechanistically, T3 action on UCP1 expression in sWAT depends upon cAMP and is blocked in Adipo-GsαKO mice even as elevated DNL persists. Thus, T3 enhances sWAT thermogenesis by amplifying cAMP signaling, while its control of adipocyte DNL can be mediated independently of both cAMP and rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1.

Abstract: Human platelets use a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration to activate all stages of thrombus formation, however, how they are able to decode cytosolic Ca2+ signals to trigger each of these independently is unknown. Other cells create local Ca2+ signals to activate Ca2+-sensitive effectors specifically localised to these subcellular regions. However, no previous study has demonstrated that agonist-stimulated human platelets can generate a local cytosolic Ca2+ signal. Platelets possess a structure called the membrane complex (MC) where the main intracellular calcium store, the dense tubular system (DTS), is coupled tightly to an invaginated portion of the plasma membrane called the open canalicular system (OCS). Here we hypothesised that human platelets use a Ca2+ nanodomain created within the MC to control the earliest phases of platelet activation. Dimethyl-BAPTA-loaded human platelets were stimulated with thrombin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ to isolate a cytosolic Ca2+ nanodomain created by Ca2+ release from the DTS. In the absence of any detectable rise in global cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, thrombin stimulation triggered Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX)-dependent Ca2+ removal into the extracellular space, as well as Ca2+-dependent shape change in the absence of platelet aggregation. The NCX-mediated Ca2+ removal was dependent on the normal localisation of the DTS, and immunofluorescent staining of NCX3 demonstrated its localisation to the OCS, consistent with this Ca2+ nanodomain being formed within the MC. These results demonstrated that human platelets possess a functional Ca2+ nanodomain contained within the MC that can control shape change independently of platelet aggregation.

Abstract: Summary
Manipulating molecules that impact T cell receptor (TCR) or cytokine signaling, such as the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2), has significant potential for advancing T cell-based immunotherapies. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how PTPN2 impacts the activation, survival, and memory formation of T cells. We find that PTPN2 deficiency renders cells in vivo and in vitro less dependent on survival-promoting cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15. Remarkably, briefly ex vivo-activated PTPN2-deficient T cells accumulate in 3- to 11-fold higher numbers following transfer into unmanipulated, antigen-free mice. Moreover, the absence of PTPN2 augments the survival of short-lived effector T cells and allows them to robustly re-expand upon secondary challenge. Importantly, we find no evidence for impaired effector function or memory formation. Mechanistically, PTPN2 deficiency causes broad changes in the expression and phosphorylation of T cell expansion and survival-associated proteins. Altogether, our data underline the therapeutic potential of targeting PTPN2 in T cell-based therapies to augment the number and survival capacity of antigen-specific T cells.

Abstract: Summary
β-Hemoglobinopathies can trigger rapid production of red blood cells in a process known as stress erythropoiesis. Cellular stress prompts differentiating erythroid precursors to express high levels of fetal γ-globin. However, the mechanisms underlying γ-globin production during cellular stress are still poorly defined. Here, we use CRISPR-Cas genome editing to model the stress caused by reduced levels of adult β-globin. We find that decreased β-globin is sufficient to induce robust re-expression of γ-globin, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of differentiating isogenic erythroid precursors implicates ATF4 as a causal regulator of this response. ATF4 binds within the HBS1L-MYB intergenic enhancer and regulates expression of MYB, a known γ-globin regulator. Overall, the reduction of ATF4 upon β-globin knockout decreases the levels of MYB and BCL11A. Identification of ATF4 as a key regulator of globin compensation adds mechanistic insight to the poorly understood phenomenon of stress-induced globin compensation and could inform strategies to treat hemoglobinopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Although an increasing number of beneficial microbiome members are characterized for the human gut and vagina, beneficial microbes are underexplored for the human upper respiratory tract (URT). In this study, we demonstrate that taxa from the beneficial Lactobacillus genus complex are more prevalent in the healthy URT than in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Several URT-specific isolates are cultured, characterized, and further explored for their genetic and functional properties related to adaptation to the URT. Catalase genes are found in the identified lactobacilli, which is a unique feature within this mostly facultative anaerobic genus. Moreover, one of our isolated strains, Lactobacillus casei AMBR2, contains fimbriae that enable strong adherence to URT epithelium, inhibit the growth and virulence of several URT pathogens, and successfully colonize nasal epithelium of healthy volunteers. This study thus demonstrates that specific lactobacilli are adapted to the URT and could have a beneficial keystone function in this habitat.

Abstract: Summary
Flowering of many plant species depends on interactions between basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors and systemically transported florigen proteins. Members of the genus Arabidopsis contain two of these bZIPs, FD and FDP, which we show have largely complementary expression patterns in shoot apices before and during flowering. CRISPR-Cas9-induced null mutants for FDP flower slightly earlier than wild-type, whereas fd mutants are late flowering. Identical G-box sequences are enriched at FD and FDP binding sites, but only FD binds to genes involved in flowering and only fd alters their transcription. However, both proteins bind to genes involved in responses to the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA), which controls developmental and stress responses. Many of these genes are differentially expressed in both fd and fdp mutant seedlings, which also show reduced ABA sensitivity. Thus, florigen-interacting bZIPs have distinct functions in flowering dependent on their expression patterns and, at earlier stages in development, play common roles in phytohormone signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells, cells of the innate immune system, are found in a steady state poised to respond to activating stimuli. Once stimulated, they rapidly undergo dynamic changes in gene expression to adopt an activated phenotype capable of stimulating immune responses. We find that the microRNA miR-9 is upregulated in both bone marrow-derived DCs and conventional DC1s but not in conventional DC2s following stimulation. miR-9 expression in BMDCs and conventional DC1s promotes enhanced DC activation and function, including the ability to stimulate T cell activation and control tumor growth. We find that miR-9 regulated the expression of several negative regulators of transcription, including the transcriptional repressor Polycomb group factor 6 (Pcgf6). These findings demonstrate that miR-9 facilitates the transition of DCs from steady state to mature state by regulating the expression of several negative regulators of DC function in a cell-type-specific manner.

Abstract: The molecular mechanism underlying autophagy impairment in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is not yet clear. Based on the causative role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in RPE necrosis, this study examined whether PARP1 is involved in the autophagy impairment observed during dry AMD pathogenesis. We found that autophagy was downregulated following H2O2-induced PARP1 activation in ARPE-19 cells and olaparib, PARP1 inhibitor, preserved the autophagy process upon H2O2 exposure in ARPE-19 cells. These findings imply that PARP1 participates in the autophagy impairment upon oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibited autolysosome formation but did not affect autophagosome formation in H2O2-exposed ARPE-19 cells, demonstrating that PARP1 is responsible for impairment of late-stage autophagy in particular. Because PARP1 consumes NAD+ while exerting its catalytic activity, we investigated whether PARP1 impedes autophagy mediated by sirtuin1 (SIRT1), which uses NAD+ as its cofactor. A NAD+ precursor restored autophagy and protected mitochondria in ARPE-19 cells by preserving SIRT1 activity upon H2O2. Moreover, olaparib failed to restore autophagy in SIRT1-depleted ARPE-19 cells, indicating that PARP1 inhibits autophagy through SIRT1 inhibition. Next, we further examined whether PARP1-induced autophagy impairment occurs in the retinas of dry AMD model mice. Histological analyses revealed that olaparib treatment protected mouse retinas against sodium iodate (SI) insult, but not in retinas cotreated with SI and wortmannin, an autophagy inhibitor. Collectively, our data demonstrate that PARP1-dependent inhibition of SIRT1 activity impedes autophagic survival of RPE cells, leading to retinal degeneration during dry AMD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian embryogenesis proceeds in utero with the support of nutrients and gases from maternal tissues. However, the contribution of the mechanical environment provided by the uterus to embryogenesis remains unaddressed. Notably, how intrauterine pressures are produced, accurately adjusted, and exerted on embryos are completely unknown. Here, we find that Reichert’s membrane, a specialized basement membrane that wraps around the implanted mouse embryo, plays a crucial role as a shock absorber to protect embryos from intrauterine pressures. Notably, intrauterine pressures are produced by uterine smooth muscle contractions, showing the highest and most frequent periodic peaks just after implantation. Mechanistically, such pressures are adjusted within the sealed space between the embryo and uterus created by Reichert’s membrane and are involved in egg-cylinder morphogenesis as an important biomechanical environment in utero. Thus, we propose the buffer space sealed by Reichert’s membrane cushions and disperses intrauterine pressures exerted on embryos for egg-cylinder morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in both innate and adaptive immunity. Emerging evidence has demonstrated metabolic reprogramming during DC activation. However, how DC activation is linked with metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Here we show that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), the rate-limiting enzyme in the last step of glycolysis, is critical for LPS-induced DC activation. Upon DC activation, JNK signaling stimulated p300 association with PKM2 for the acetylation of lysine 433, a classic posttranslational modification critical for PKM2 destabilization and nuclear re-localization. Subsequently, nuclear PKM2 partnered with c-Rel to enhance Il12p35 expression, which is important for Th1 cell differentiation. Meanwhile, decreased enzymatic activity of PKM2 due to detetramerization facilitated glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis, helping DCs meet their need for biomacromolecules. Together, we provide evidence for metabolic control of DC activation and offer insights into aberrant immune responses due to dysregulated Th1 functions.

Abstract: Summary
Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells varies in specificity and efficiency. Stochastic, genetic, intracellular, and environmental factors affect maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation into early embryonic lineages. However, factors affecting variation in in vitro differentiation to defined cell types are not well understood. To address this, we focused on a well-established differentiation process to cerebral cortex neural progenitor cells and their neuronal progeny from human pluripotent stem cells. Analysis of 162 differentiation outcomes of 61 stem cell lines derived from 37 individuals showed that most variation occurs along gene expression axes reflecting dorsoventral and rostrocaudal spatial expression during in vivo brain development. Line-independent and line-dependent variations occur, with the latter driven largely by differences in endogenous Wnt signaling activity. Tuning Wnt signaling during a specific phase early in the differentiation process reduces variability, demonstrating that cell-line/genome-specific differentiation outcome biases can be corrected by controlling extracellular signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Short linear motifs (SLiMs) drive dynamic protein-protein interactions essential for signaling, but sequence degeneracy and low binding affinities make them difficult to identify. We harnessed unbiased systematic approaches for SLiM discovery to elucidate the regulatory network of calcineurin (CN)/PP2B, the Ca2+-activated phosphatase that recognizes LxVP and PxIxIT motifs. In vitro proteome-wide detection of CN-binding peptides, in vivo SLiM-dependent proximity labeling, and in silico modeling of motif determinants uncovered unanticipated CN interactors, including NOTCH1, which we establish as a CN substrate. Unexpectedly, CN shows SLiM-dependent proximity to centrosomal and nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins—structures where Ca2+ signaling is largely uncharacterized. CN dephosphorylates human and yeast NPC proteins and promotes accumulation of a nuclear transport reporter, suggesting conserved NPC regulation by CN. The CN network assembled here provides a resource to investigate Ca2+ and CN signaling and demonstrates synergy between experimental and computational methods, establishing a blueprint for examining SLiM-based networks.

Abstract: Summary
Set2 co-transcriptionally methylates lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36), producing mono-, di-, and trimethylation (H3K36me1/2/3). These modifications recruit or repel chromatin effector proteins important for transcriptional fidelity, mRNA splicing, and DNA repair. However, it was not known whether the different methylation states of H3K36 have distinct biological functions. Here, we use engineered forms of Set2 that produce different lysine methylation states to identify unique and shared functions for H3K36 modifications. Although H3K36me1/2 and H3K36me3 are functionally redundant in many SET2 deletion phenotypes, we found that H3K36me3 has a unique function related to Bur1 kinase activity and FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex function. Further, during nutrient stress, either H3K36me1/2 or H3K36me3 represses high levels of histone acetylation and cryptic transcription that arises from within genes. Our findings uncover the potential for the regulation of diverse chromatin functions by different H3K36 methylation states.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have revealed an essential role for embryonic cortical development in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the genetic basis and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we generate mutant human embryonic stem cell lines (Mut hESCs) carrying an NR2F1-R112K mutation that has been identified in a patient with ASD features and investigate their neurodevelopmental alterations. Mut hESCs overproduce ventral telencephalic neuron progenitors (ventral NPCs) and underproduce dorsal NPCs, causing the imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory neurons. These alterations can be mainly attributed to the aberrantly activated Hedgehog signaling pathway. Moreover, the corresponding Nr2f1 point-mutant mice display a similar excitatory/inhibitory neuron imbalance and abnormal behaviors. Antagonizing the increased inhibitory synaptic transmission partially alleviates their behavioral deficits. Together, our results suggest that the NR2F1-dependent imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory neuron differentiation caused by the activated Hedgehog pathway is one precursor of neurodevelopmental disorders and may enlighten the therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Extension of telomeres is a critical step in the immortalization of cancer cells. This complex reaction requires proper spatiotemporal coordination of telomerase and telomeres and remains poorly understood at the cellular level. To understand how cancer cells execute this process, we combine CRISPR genome editing and MS2 RNA tagging to image single molecules of telomerase RNA (hTR). Real-time dynamics and photoactivation experiments of hTR in Cajal bodies (CBs) reveal that hTERT controls the exit of hTR from CBs. Single-molecule tracking of hTR at telomeres shows that TPP1-mediated recruitment results in short telomere-telomerase scanning interactions, and then base pairing between hTR and telomere ssDNA promotes long interactions required for stable telomerase retention. Interestingly, POT1 OB-fold mutations that result in abnormally long telomeres in cancers act by enhancing this retention step. In summary, single-molecule imaging unveils the life cycle of telomerase RNA and provides a framework to reveal how cancer-associated mutations mechanistically drive defects in telomere homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is installed by the METTL3-METTL14 methyltransferase complex. This modification has critical regulatory roles in various biological processes. Here, we report that deletion of Mettl14 dramatically reduces mRNA m6A methylation in developing B cells and severely blocks B cell development in mice. Deletion of Mettl14 impairs interleukin-7 (IL-7)-induced pro-B cell proliferation and the large-pre-B-to-small-pre-B transition and causes dramatic abnormalities in gene expression programs important for B cell development. Suppression of a group of transcripts by cytoplasmic m6A reader YTHDF2 is critical to the IL-7-induced pro-B cell proliferation. In contrast, the block in the large-pre-B-to-small-pre-B transition is independent of YTHDF1 or YTHDF2 but is associated with a failure to properly upregulate key transcription factors regulating this transition. Our data highlight the important regulatory roles of the RNA m6A methylation and its reader proteins in early B cell development.

Abstract: Summary
The transmembrane sodium-calcium (Na-Ca) exchanger 1 (NCX1) regulates cytoplasmic Ca levels by facilitating electrogenic exchange of Ca for Na. Palmitoylation, the only reversible post-translational modification known to modulate NCX1 activity, controls NCX1 inactivation. Here, we show that palmitoylation of NCX1 modifies the structural arrangement of the NCX1 dimer and controls its affinity for lipid-ordered membrane domains. NCX1 palmitoylation occurs dynamically at the cell surface under the control of the enzymes zDHHC5 and APT1. We identify the position of the endogenous exchange inhibitory peptide (XIP) binding site within the NCX1 regulatory intracellular loop and demonstrate that palmitoylation controls the ability of XIP to bind this site. We also show that changes in NCX1 palmitoylation change cytosolic Ca. Our results thus demonstrate the broad molecular consequences of NCX1 palmitoylation and highlight a means to manipulate the inactivation of this ubiquitous ion transporter that could ameliorate pathologies linked to Ca overload via NCX1.

Abstract: Summary
Prostate cancers (PCs) with loss of the potent tumor suppressors TP53 and RB1 exhibit poor outcomes. TP53 and RB1 also influence cell plasticity and are frequently lost in PCs with neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. Therapeutic strategies that address these aggressive variant PCs are urgently needed. Using deep genomic profiling of 410 metastatic biopsies, we determine the relationships between combined TP53 and RB1 loss and PC phenotypes. Notably, 40% of TP53/RB1-deficient tumors are classified as AR-active adenocarcinomas, indicating that NE differentiation is not an obligate consequence of TP53/RB1 inactivation. A gene expression signature reflecting TP53/RB1 loss is associated with diminished responses to AR antagonists and reduced survival. These tumors exhibit high proliferation rates and evidence of elevated DNA repair processes. While tumor cells lacking TP53/RB1 are highly resistant to all single-agent therapeutics tested, the combination of PARP and ATR inhibition is found to produce significant responses, reflecting a clinically exploitable vulnerability resulting from replication stress.

Abstract: Summary
Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we examine the stromal compartment in murine melanoma and draining lymph nodes (LNs) at points across tumor development, providing data at http://www.teichlab.org/data/. Naive lymphocytes from LNs undergo activation and clonal expansion within the tumor, before PD1 and Lag3 expression, while tumor-associated myeloid cells promote the formation of a suppressive niche. We identify three temporally distinct stromal populations displaying unique functional signatures, conserved across mouse and human tumors. Whereas “immune” stromal cells are observed in early tumors, “contractile” cells become more prevalent at later time points. Complement component C3 is specifically expressed in the immune population. Its cleavage product C3a supports the recruitment of C3aR+ macrophages, and perturbation of C3a and C3aR disrupts immune infiltration, slowing tumor growth. Our results highlight the power of scRNA-seq to identify complex interplays and increase stromal diversity as a tumor develops, revealing that stromal cells acquire the capacity to modulate immune landscapes from early disease.

Abstract: Summary
The Tousled-like kinases 1 and 2 (TLK1/2) control histone deposition through the ASF1 histone chaperone and influence cell cycle progression and genome maintenance, yet the mechanisms underlying TLK-mediated genome stability remain uncertain. Here, we show that TLK loss results in severe chromatin decompaction and altered genome accessibility, particularly affecting heterochromatic regions. Failure to maintain heterochromatin increases spurious transcription of repetitive elements and induces features of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). TLK depletion culminates in a cGAS-STING-TBK1-mediated innate immune response that is independent of replication-stress signaling and attenuated by the depletion of factors required to produce extra-telomeric DNA. Analysis of human cancers reveals that chromosomal instability correlates with high TLK2 and low STING levels in many cohorts. Based on these findings, we propose that high TLK levels contribute to immune evasion in chromosomally unstable and ALT+ cancers.

Abstract: Mycobacterium chelonae is an environmental, non-tuberculous mycobacterial species, capable of causing infections in humans. Biofilm formation is a key strategy used by M. chelonae in colonising niches in the environment and in the host. We studied a water-air interface (pellicle) biofilm of M. chelonae using a wide array of approaches to outline the molecular structure and composition of the biofilm. Scanning electron micrographs showed that M. chelonae biofilms produced an extracellular matrix. Using a combination of biochemical analysis, Raman spectroscopy, and fluorescence microscopy, we showed the matrix to consist of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and eDNA. Glucose was the predominant sugar present in the biofilm matrix, and its relative abundance decreased in late (established) biofilms. RNA-seq analysis of the biofilms showed upregulation of genes involved in redox metabolism. Additionally, genes involved in mycolic acid, other lipid and glyoxylate metabolism were also upregulated in the early biofilms.

Abstract: Summary
Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) control key cellular processes by promoting ubiquitylation of a multitude of soluble cytosolic and nuclear proteins. Subsets of CRL complexes are recruited and activated locally at cellular membranes; however, few CRL functions and substrates at these distinct cellular compartments are known. Here, we use a proteomic screen to identify proteins that are ubiquitylated at cellular membranes and found that Lunapark, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-shaping protein localized to ER three-way junctions, is ubiquitylated by the CRL3KLHL12 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that Lunapark interacts with mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1), a central cellular regulator that coordinates growth and metabolism with environmental conditions. We show that mTORC1 binds Lunapark specifically at three-way junctions, and lysosomes, where mTORC1 is activated, make contact with three-way junctions where Lunapark resides. Inhibition of Lunapark ubiquitylation results in neurodevelopmental defects indicating that KLHL12-dependent ubiquitylation of Lunapark is required for normal growth and development.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of insoluble inclusions in the cytosol and nucleus is associated with impaired protein homeostasis and is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the absence of the autophagic machinery, nuclear protein aggregates require a solubilization step preceding degradation by the 26S proteasome. Using yeast, we identify a nuclear protein quality control pathway required for the clearance of protein aggregates. The nuclear J-domain protein Apj1 supports protein disaggregation together with Hsp70 but independent of the canonical disaggregase Hsp104. Disaggregation mediated by Apj1/Hsp70 promotes turnover rather than refolding. A loss of Apj1 activity uncouples disaggregation from proteasomal turnover, resulting in accumulation of toxic soluble protein species. Endogenous substrates of the Apj1/Hsp70 pathway include both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, which aggregate inside the nucleus upon proteotoxic stress. These findings demonstrate the coordinated activity of the Apj1/Hsp70 disaggregation system with the 26S proteasome in facilitating the clearance of toxic inclusions inside the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
Somatic stem cells expand massively during tissue regeneration, which might require control of cell fitness, allowing elimination of non-competitive, potentially harmful cells. How or if such cells are removed to restore organ function is not fully understood. Here, we show that a substantial fraction of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) undergo necroptosis because of epigenetic rewiring during chronic skeletal muscle regeneration, which is required for efficient regeneration of dystrophic muscles. Inhibition of necroptosis strongly enhances suppression of MuSC expansion in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Prevention of necroptosis in MuSCs of healthy muscles is mediated by the chromatin remodeler CHD4, which directly represses the necroptotic effector Ripk3, while CHD4-dependent Ripk3 repression is dramatically attenuated in dystrophic muscles. Loss of Ripk3 repression by inactivation of Chd4 causes massive necroptosis of MuSCs, abolishing regeneration. Our study demonstrates how programmed cell death in MuSCs is tightly controlled to achieve optimal tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) body is a phase-separated nuclear structure physically associated with chromatin, implying its crucial roles in genome functions. However, its role in transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. We developed APEX-mediated chromatin labeling and purification (ALaP) to identify the genomic regions proximal to PML bodies. We found that PML bodies associate with active regulatory regions across the genome and with ∼300 kb of the short arm of the Y chromosome (YS300) in mouse embryonic stem cells. The PML body association with YS300 is essential for the transcriptional activity of the neighboring Y-linked clustered genes. Mechanistically, PML bodies provide specific nuclear spaces that the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A cannot access, resulting in the steady maintenance of a hypo-methylated state at Y-linked gene promoters. Our study underscores a new mechanism for gene regulation in the 3D nuclear space and provides insights into the functional properties of nuclear structures for genome function.

Abstract: Male infertility is a global problem in modern society of which capacitating defects are a major cause. Previous studies have demonstrated that Ca2+ ionophore A23187 can make mouse sperm capable of fertilizing in vitro, which may aid in clinical treatment of capacitating defects. However, the detailed role and mechanism of Ca2+ in the capacitating process are still unclear especially how A23187 quickly renders sperm immotile and inhibits cAMP/PKA-mediated phosphorylation. We report that A23187 induces a Ca2+ flux in the mitochondria enriched sperm tail and excess Ca2+ inhibits key metabolic enzymes involved in acetyl-CoA biosynthesis, TCA cycle and electron transport chain pathways resulting in reduced ATP and overall energy production, however this flux does not destroy the structure of the sperm tail. Due to the decrease in ATP production, which is the main phosphate group donator and the power of sperm, the sperm is rendered immobile and PKA-mediated phosphorylation is inhibited. Our study proposed a possible mechanism through which A23187 reduces sperm motility and PKA-mediated phosphorylation from ATP generation, thus providing basic data for exploring the functional roles of Ca2+ in sperm in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear size plays pivotal roles in gene expression, embryo development, and disease. A central hypothesis in organisms ranging from yeast to vertebrates is that nuclear size scales to cell size. This implies that nuclei may reach steady-state sizes set by limiting cytoplasmic pools of size-regulating components. By monitoring nuclear dynamics in early sea urchin embryos, we found that nuclei undergo substantial growth in each interphase, reaching a maximal size prior to mitosis that declined steadily over the course of development. Manipulations of cytoplasmic volume through multiple chemical and physical means ruled out cell size as a major determinant of nuclear size and growth. Rather, our data suggest that the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum, accumulated through dynein activity, serves as a limiting membrane pool that sets nuclear surface growth rate. Partitioning of this local pool at each cell division modulates nuclear growth kinetics and dictates size scaling throughout early development.

Abstract: Summary
Tight coordination of gene expression in the developing cerebellum is crucial for establishment of neuronal circuits governing motor and cognitive function. However, transcriptional changes alone do not explain all of the switches underlying neuronal differentiation. Here we unveiled a widespread and highly dynamic splicing program that affects synaptic genes in cerebellar neurons. The motifs enriched in modulated exons implicated the splicing factor Sam68 as a regulator of this program. Sam68 controls splicing of exons with weak branchpoints by directly binding near the 3′ splice site and competing with U2AF recruitment. Ablation of Sam68 disrupts splicing regulation of synaptic genes associated with neurodevelopmental diseases and impairs synaptic connections and firing of Purkinje cells, resulting in motor coordination defects, ataxia, and abnormal social behavior. These findings uncover an unexpectedly dynamic splicing regulatory network that shapes the synapse in early life and establishes motor and cognitive circuitry in the developing cerebellum.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 infections are rapidly spreading around the globe. The rapid development of therapies is of major importance. However, our lack of understanding of the molecular processes and host cell signaling events underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection hinders therapy development. We use a SARS-CoV-2 infection system in permissible human cells to study signaling changes by phosphoproteomics. We identify viral protein phosphorylation and define phosphorylation-driven host cell signaling changes upon infection. Growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling and downstream pathways are activated. Drug-protein network analyses revealed GFR signaling as key pathways targetable by approved drugs. The inhibition of GFR downstream signaling by five compounds prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells, assessed by cytopathic effect, viral dsRNA production, and viral RNA release into the supernatant. This study describes host cell signaling events upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals GFR signaling as a central pathway essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication. It provides novel strategies for COVID-19 treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Generating robust CD4+ T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) responses is essential for protective vaccine-induced type 1 immunity. Here, we examine whether immunization formulation associated with enhanced vaccine efficacy promotes antigen targeting and cell recruitment into lymph node (LN) niches associated with optimal type 1 responses. Immunization with antigen and Toll-like receptor agonist emulsified in oil leads to an increased differentiation of IFNγ/TNF-α+ polyfunctional Th1 cells compared to an identical immunization in saline. Oil immunization results in a rapid delivery and persistence of antigen in interfollicular regions (IFRs) of the LN, whereas without oil, antigen is distributed in the medullary region. Following oil immunization, CXCL10-producing inflammatory monocytes accumulate in the IFR, which mobilizes antigen-specific CD4+ T cells into this niche. In this microenvironment, CD4+ T cells are advantageously positioned to encounter arriving IL-12-producing inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs). These data suggest that formulations delivering antigen to the LN IFR create an inflammatory niche that can improve vaccine efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
In higher eukaryotes, the mRNA sequence in the direct vicinity of the start codon, called the Kozak sequence (CRCCaugG, where R is a purine), is known to influence the rate of the initiation process. However, the molecular basis underlying its role remains poorly understood. Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of mammalian late-stage 48S initiation complexes (LS48S ICs) in the presence of two different native mRNA sequences, β-globin and histone 4, at overall resolution of 3 and 3.5 Å, respectively. Our high-resolution structures unravel key interactions from the mRNA to eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs): 1A, 2, 3, 18S rRNA, and several 40S ribosomal proteins. In addition, we are able to study the structural role of ABCE1 in the formation of native 48S ICs. Our results reveal a comprehensive map of ribosome/eIF-mRNA and ribosome/eIF-tRNA interactions and suggest the impact of mRNA sequence on the structure of the LS48S IC.

Abstract: Summary
Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are ubiquitous genetic elements in bacterial genomes, but their functions are controversial. Although they are frequently postulated to regulate cell growth following stress, few null phenotypes for TA systems have been reported. Here, we show that TA transcript levels can increase substantially in response to stress, but toxin is not liberated. We find that the growth of an Escherichia coli strain lacking ten TA systems encoding endoribonuclease toxins is not affected following exposure to six stresses that each trigger TA transcription. Additionally, using RNA sequencing, we find no evidence of mRNA cleavage following stress. Stress-induced transcription arises from antitoxin degradation and relief of transcriptional autoregulation. Importantly, although free antitoxin is readily degraded in vivo, antitoxin bound to toxin is protected from proteolysis, preventing release of active toxin. Thus, transcription is not a reliable marker of TA activity, and TA systems do not strongly promote survival following individual stresses.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathways protect cells from toxicity caused by incomplete protein products resulting from translation of damaged or problematic mRNAs. Extensive work in yeast has identified highly conserved mechanisms that lead to degradation of faulty mRNA and partially synthesized polypeptides. Here we used CRISPR-Cas9-based screening to search for additional RQC strategies in mammals. We found that failed translation leads to specific inhibition of translation initiation on that message. This negative feedback loop is mediated by two translation inhibitors, GIGYF2 and 4EHP. Model substrates and growth-based assays established that inhibition of additional rounds of translation acts in concert with known RQC pathways to prevent buildup of toxic proteins. Inability to block translation of faulty mRNAs and subsequent accumulation of partially synthesized polypeptides could explain the neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders observed in mice and humans with compromised GIGYF2 function.

Abstract: Summary
G protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) and PPARγ agonists each have insulin sensitizing effects. But whether these two pathways functionally interact and can be leveraged together to markedly improve insulin resistance has not been explored. Here, we show that treatment with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (Rosi) plus the GPR120 agonist Compound A leads to additive effects to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, but at lower doses of Rosi, thus avoiding its known side effects. Mechanistically, we show that GPR120 is a PPARγ target gene in adipocytes, while GPR120 augments PPARγ activity by inducing the endogenous ligand 15d-PGJ2 and by blocking ERK-mediated inhibition of PPARγ. Further, we used macrophage- (MKO) or adipocyte-specific GPR120 KO (AKO) mice to show that GRP120 has anti-inflammatory effects via macrophages while working with PPARγ in adipocytes to increase insulin sensitivity. These results raise the prospect of a safer way to increase insulin sensitization in the clinic.

Abstract: Apoptotic osteocytes were found in the hypoxic bone microenvironment in osteoporosis, osteotomy, orthodontic tooth movement and periodontitis, and played a key role in bone remolding and the differentiation of osteoclasts. Hypoxia inducible factor-1α(HIF-1α), as a transcription factor under hypoxic conditions, has been confirmed to participate in cell apoptosis. However, the effect of HIF-1α on osteocytes apoptosis and the osteocyte-mediated osteoclast formation remains elusive. Here, we hypothesized that HIF-1α was involved in osteocytes apoptosis. Our results showed that CoCl2 increased the MLO-Y4 cells apoptosis by upregulating the proapoptotic gene expression of caspase-3. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-1α decreased the phosphorylation by JNK and the activation of caspase-3 to inhibit the cell apoptosis in MLO-Y4. Furthermore, SP600125, an inhibitor of JNK, reversed CoCl2-induced the increased apoptosis of MLO-Y4 cells in term of reducing the expression of caspase-3. These findings revealed that HIF-1α served as a pro-apoptotic factor in the apoptosis of MLO-Y4 cells cultured with CoCl2, by activating the JNK/caspase-3 signaling pathway. Besides, the osteocyte-mediated osteoclastogenesis was reduced with the decline of the expression of HIF-1α and caspase-3 in MLO-Y4 cells. Our study provided an idea for a more comprehensive understanding of HIF-1α and the process of bone remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) play a pivotal role in determining cell states, yet our understanding of the causative relationship between TFs and cell states is limited. Here, we systematically examine the state changes of human pluripotent embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by the large-scale manipulation of single TFs. We establish 2,135 hESC lines, representing three clones each of 714 doxycycline (Dox)-inducible genes including 481 TFs, and obtain 26,998 microscopic cell images and 2,174 transcriptome datasets—RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or microarrays—48 h after the presence or absence of Dox. Interestingly, the expression of essentially all the genes, including genes located in heterochromatin regions, are perturbed by these TFs. TFs are also characterized by their ability to induce differentiation of hESCs into specific cell lineages. These analyses help to provide a way of classifying TFs and identifying specific sets of TFs for directing hESC differentiation into desired cell types.

Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fatal malignant tumor that is characterized by diffusive growth of tumor cells into the surrounding brain parenchyma. However, the diffusive nature of GBM and its relationship with the tumor microenvironment (TME) is still unknown. Here, we investigated the interactions of GBM with the surrounding microenvironment in orthotopic xenograft animal models using two human glioma cell lines, U87 and LN229. The GBM cells in our model showed different features on the aspects of cell growth rate during their development, dispersive nature of glioma tumor cells along blood vessels, and invasion into the brain parenchyma. Our results indicated that these differences in the two models are in part due to differences in the expression of CXCR4 and STAT3, both of which play an important role in tumor progression. In addition, the GBM shows considerable accumulation of resident microglia and peripheral macrophages, but polarizes differently into tumor-supporting cells. These results suggest that the intrinsic factors of GBM and their interaction with the TME determine the diffusive nature and probably the responsiveness to non-cancer cells in the TME.

Abstract: Summary
Centrosomes function in key cellular processes ranging from cell division to cellular signaling. Their dysfunction is linked to cancer and developmental disorders. Here, we identify CCDC57 as a pleiotropic regulator of centriole duplication, mitosis, and ciliogenesis. Combining proximity mapping with superresolution imaging, we show that CCDC57 localizes to the proximal end of centrioles and interacts with the microcephaly protein CEP63, centriolar satellite proteins, and microtubules. Loss of CCDC57 causes defects in centriole duplication and results in a failure to localize CEP63 and CEP152 to the centrosome. Additionally, CCDC57 depletion perturbs mitotic progression both in wild-type and centriole-less cells. Importantly, its centrosome-targeting region is required for its interaction with CEP63 and functions during centriole duplication and cilium assembly, whereas the microtubule-targeting region is required for its mitotic functions. Together, our results identify CCDC57 as a critical interface between centrosome and microtubule-mediated cellular processes that are deregulated in microcephaly.

Abstract: Summary
Trained immunity confers a sustained augmented response of innate immune cells to a secondary challenge, via a process dependent on metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming. Because of its previous associations with metabolic and transcriptional memory, as well as the importance of H3 histone lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) to innate immune memory, we hypothesize that the Set7 methyltransferase has an important role in trained immunity induced by β-glucan. Using pharmacological studies of human primary monocytes, we identify trained immunity-specific immunometabolic pathways regulated by Set7, including a previously unreported H3K4me1-dependent plasticity in the induction of oxidative phosphorylation. Recapitulation of β-glucan training in vivo additionally identifies Set7-dependent changes in gene expression previously associated with the modulation of myelopoiesis progenitors in trained immunity. By revealing Set7 as a key regulator of trained immunity, these findings provide mechanistic insight into sustained metabolic changes and underscore the importance of characterizing regulatory circuits of innate immune memory.

Abstract: Summary
Telomerase is an attractive target for anti-tumor therapy as it is almost universally expressed in cancer cells. Here, we show that treatment with a telomere-targeting drug, 6-thio-2′-deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG), leads to tumor regression through innate and adaptive immune-dependent responses in syngeneic and humanized mouse models of telomerase-expressing cancers. 6-thio-dG treatment causes telomere-associated DNA damages that are sensed by dendritic cells (DCs) and activates the host cytosolic DNA sensing STING/interferon I pathway, resulting in enhanced cross-priming capacity of DCs and tumor-specific CD8+ T cell activation. Moreover, 6-thio-dG overcomes resistance to checkpoint blockade in advanced cancer models. Our results unveil how telomere stress increases innate sensing and adaptive anti-tumor immunity and provide strong rationales for combining telomere-targeting therapy with immunotherapy.

Abstract: Wnt/β-Catenin signaling is required for the development and differentiation of cochlear hair cells. Total of 80 natural compounds derived from the FDA-approved Drug Library of Selleck were screened by T-cell factor Reporter Plasmid (TOP)-Flash assay to identify the activation of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling. The mouse cochlear hair cells (HEI-OC1) were treated with cisplatin with or without Guaiacin, and the relative expression of β-Catenin and TRIM33 were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blots. The viability of HEI-OC1 was assayed by MTT method, and mouse cochlear cultures were utilized to detect the Ex vivo survival of cochlear hair cells. Guaiacin was testified to have the most vigorous ability to promote Wnt/β-Catenin signaling among 80 compounds detected, and it can also improve the β-Catenin signaling in mouse cochlear hair cells with up-regulated β-Catenin protein expression, unchanged β-Catenin mRNA expression, and down-regulated TRIM33 expression. Guaiacin increased the viability of HEI-OC1 cells cultured with or without cisplatin, and such a protective effect was also testified in mouse cochlear cultures. Our data indicate that Guaiacin could increase Wnt/β-Catenin signaling by regulating TRIM33/β-Catenin axis, which contributes to the improved survival of cochlear hair cells.

Abstract: Summary
The asymmetric distribution of auxin leads to the bending growth of hypocotyls during gravitropic and phototropic responses, but the signaling events downstream of auxin remain unclear. Here, we identify many SAUR genes showing asymmetric expression in soybean hypocotyls during gravistimulation and then study their homologs in Arabidopsis. SAUR19 subfamily genes have asymmetric expression in Arabidopsis hypocotyls during gravitropic and phototropic responses, induced by the lateral redistribution of auxin. Both the mutation of SAUR19 subfamily genes and the ectopic expression of SAUR19 weaken these tropic responses, indicating the critical role of their asymmetric expression. The auxin-responsive transcription factor ARF7 may directly bind the SAUR19 promoter and activate SAUR19 expression asymmetrically in tropic responses. Taken together, our results reveal that a gravity- or light-triggered asymmetric auxin distribution induces the asymmetric expression of SAUR19 subfamily genes by ARF7 and ARF19 in the hypocotyls, which leads to bending growth during gravitropic and phototropic responses.

Abstract: The carapace from the Chinese soft-shelled turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) is used as a traditional Chinese medicine. Acid-soluble collagen (ASC) and pepsin-soluble collagen (PSC) from turtle carapace were isolated and characterized to screen novel collagen material in this study. Yields of 1.0% and 2.8% were obtained for ASC and PSC which contained glycine as the major amino acid and had high imino acid content. Both collagens had maximum ultraviolet absorption peaks of 220 nm. SDS-PAGE revealed that the structure of both collagens was similar, belonging to type I collagen. Relative viscosities of collagens were decreased as the temperature increased. Collagens showed minimum solubility at pH 8 and maximum solubility at a salt concentration of 3%. The denaturation temperature (Td) of PSC was higher whereas the melting temperature was lower than that of ASC. Both ASC and PSC appeared to be spongy like microstructure with fibrillar pores shown by scanning electron microscopy. The results suggest that collagens isolated from turtle carapace has high thermal stability with potential uses as new substitute for mammalian collagen in medicinal, food or biomaterial fields. However, their biological or pharmacological activities are needed to be further studied.

Abstract: Chloride fluxes through the calcium-gated chloride channel Anoctamin-1 (TMEM16A) control blood pressure, secretion of saliva, mucin, insulin, and melatonin, gastrointestinal motility, sperm capacitation and motility, and pain sensation. Calcium activates a myriad of regulatory proteins but how these proteins affect TMEM16A activity is unresolved. Here we show by co-immunoprecipitation that increasing intracellular calcium with ionomycin or by activating sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors, induces coupling of calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and prolyl isomerase FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) to TMEM16A in HEK-293 cells. Application of drugs that target either calcineurin (cyclosporine A) or FKBP12 (tacrolimus known as FK506 and sirolimus known as rapamycin) caused a decrease in TMEM16A activity. In addition, FK506 and BAPTA-AM prevented co-immunoprecipitation between FKBP12 and TMEM16A. FK506 rendered the channel insensitive to cyclosporine A without altering its apparent calcium sensitivity whereas zero intracellular calcium blocked the effect of FK506. Rapamycin decreased TMEM16A activity in cells pre-treated with cyclosporine A or FK506. These results suggest the formation of a TMEM16A-FKBP12-calcineurin complex that regulates channel function. We conclude that upon a cytosolic calcium increase the TMEM16A-FKPB12-calcineurin trimers are assembled. Such hetero-oligomerization enhances TMEM16A channel activity but is not mandatory for activation by calcium.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is an inevitable process that involves profound physiological changes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in various biological processes but are not systemically studied in aging. To provide an organism-wide lncRNA landscape during aging, we conduct comprehensive RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses across the mouse lifespan. Of the 1,675 aging-regulated lncRNAs (AR-lncRNAs) identified, the majority are connected to inflammation-related biological pathways. AR-lncRNAs exhibit high tissue specificity; conversely, those with higher tissue specificity are preferentially regulated during aging. White adipose tissue (WAT) displays the highest number of AR-lncRNAs and develops the most dynamic crosstalk between AR-lncRNA and AR-mRNA during aging. An adipose-enriched AR-lncRNA, lnc-adipoAR1, is negatively correlated with aging, and knocking it down inhibits adipogenesis, phenocopying the compromised adipogenic capacity of aged fat. Our works together reveal AR-lncRNAs as essential components in aging and suggest that although each tissue ages in a distinct manner, WAT is a leading contributor to aging-related health decline.

Abstract: Summary
Strand selection is a critical step in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. Although the dominant strand may change depending on cellular contexts, the molecular mechanism and physiological significance of such alternative strand selection (or “arm switching”) remain elusive. Here we find miR-324 to be one of the strongly regulated miRNAs by arm switching and identify the terminal uridylyl transferases TUT4 and TUT7 to be the key regulators. Uridylation of pre-miR-324 by TUT4/7 re-positions DICER on the pre-miRNA and shifts the cleavage site. This alternative processing produces a duplex with a different terminus from which the 3′ strand (3p) is selected instead of the 5′ strand (5p). In glioblastoma, the TUT4/7 and 3p levels are upregulated, whereas the 5p level is reduced. Manipulation of the strand ratio is sufficient to impair glioblastoma cell proliferation. This study uncovers a role of uridylation as a molecular switch in alternative strand selection and implicates its therapeutic potential.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) signaling is a hallmark of viral control and host protection. Here, we show that, in the hippocampus of healthy IFNAR-deficient mice, synapse number and synaptic plasticity, as well as spatial learning, are impaired. This is also the case for IFN-β-deficient animals. Moreover, antibody-mediated IFNAR blocking acutely interferes with neuronal plasticity, whereas a low-dose application of IFN-β has a positive effect on dendritic spine structure. Interfering with IFNAR signaling in different cell types shows a role for cognitive function and synaptic plasticity specifically mediated by astrocytes. Intriguingly, levels of the astrocytic glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) are reduced significantly upon IFN-β treatment and increase following inhibition of IFNAR signaling. These results indicate that, besides the prominent role for host defense, IFNAR is important for synaptic plasticity as well as cognitive function. Astrocytes are at the center stage of this so-far-unknown signaling cascade.

Abstract: Summary
Cmr-β is a type III-B CRISPR-Cas complex that, upon target RNA recognition, unleashes a multifaceted immune response against invading genetic elements, including single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage, cyclic oligoadenylate synthesis, and also a unique UA-specific single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) hydrolysis by the Cmr2 subunit. Here, we present the structure-function relationship of Cmr-β, unveiling how binding of the target RNA regulates the Cmr2 activities. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis revealed the unique subunit architecture of Cmr-β and captured the complex in different conformational stages of the immune response, including the non-cognate and cognate target-RNA-bound complexes. The binding of the target RNA induces a conformational change of Cmr2, which together with the complementation between the 5′ tag in the CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) and the 3′ antitag of the target RNA activate different configurations in a unique loop of the Cmr3 subunit, which acts as an allosteric sensor signaling the self- versus non-self-recognition. These findings highlight the diverse defense strategies of type III complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary nutrients shape complex interactions between hosts and their commensal gut bacteria, further promoting flexibility in host-microbiota associations that can drive nutritional symbiosis. However, it remains less clear if diet-dependent host signaling mechanisms also influence these associations. Using Drosophila, we show here that nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/Relish, an innate immune transcription factor emerging as a signaling node linking nutrient-immune-metabolic interactions, is vital to adapt gut microbiota species composition to host diet macronutrient composition. We find that Relish is required within midgut enterocytes to amplify host-Lactobacillus associations, an important bacterial mediator of nutritional symbiosis, and thus modulate microbiota composition in response to dietary adaptation. Relish limits diet-dependent transcriptional inducibility of the cap-dependent translation inhibitor 4E-BP/Thor to control microbiota composition. Furthermore, maintaining cap-dependent translation in response to dietary adaptation is critical to amplify host-Lactobacillus associations. These results highlight that NF-κB-dependent host signaling mechanisms, in coordination with host translation control, shape diet-microbiota interactions.

Endogenous DNA 3′ Blocks Are Vulnerabilities for BRCA1 and BRCA2 Deficiency and Are Reversed by the APE2 Nuclease,

Abstract: Summary
The APEX2 gene encodes APE2, a nuclease related to APE1, the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease acting in base excision repair. Loss of APE2 is lethal in cells with mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2, making APE2 a prime target for homologous recombination-defective cancers. However, because the function of APE2 in DNA repair is poorly understood, it is unclear why BRCA-deficient cells require APE2 for viability. Here we present the genetic interaction profiles of APE2, APE1, and TDP1 deficiency coupled to biochemical and structural dissection of APE2. We conclude that the main role of APE2 is to reverse blocked 3′ DNA ends, problematic lesions that preclude DNA synthesis. Our work also suggests that TOP1 processing of genomic ribonucleotides is the main source of 3′-blocking lesions relevant to APEX2-BRCA1/2 synthetic lethality. The exquisite sensitivity of BRCA-deficient cells to 3′ blocks indicates that they represent a tractable vulnerability in homologous recombination-deficient tumor cells.

We apply this system for systematically identifying not only pairwise but also three-way synergistic therapeutic target combinations and successfully validate double- and triple-combination regimens for suppression of cancer cell growth and protection against Parkinson’s disease-associated toxicity. This system overcomes the practical challenges of experimenting on a large number of high-order genetic and drug combinations and can be applied to uncover the rare synergistic interactions between druggable targets.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is a top public health concern, and a molecule that safely treats obesity is urgently needed. Disulfiram (known commercially as Antabuse), an FDA-approved treatment for chronic alcohol addiction, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and helps protect against certain types of cancer. Here, we show that in mice disulfiram treatment prevented body weight gain and abrogated the adverse impact of an obesogenic diet on insulin responsiveness while mitigating liver steatosis and pancreatic islet hypertrophy. Additionally, disulfiram treatment reversed established diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunctions in middle-aged mice. Reductions in feeding efficiency and increases in energy expenditure were associated with body weight regulation in response to long-term disulfiram treatment. Loss of fat tissue and an increase in liver fenestrations were also observed in rats on disulfiram. Given the potent anti-obesogenic effects in rodents, repurposing disulfiram in the clinic could represent a new strategy to treat obesity and its metabolic comorbidities.

Abstract: Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury is seen in a variety of clinical conditions, including hepatic thrombosis, systemic hypotension, and liver transplantation. Calcium (Ca2+) signaling mediates several pathophysiological processes in the liver, but it is not known whether and how intracellular Ca2+ channels are involved in the hepatocellular events secondary to ischemia-reperfusion. Using an animal model of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, we observed a progressive increase in expression of the type 3 isoform of the inositol trisphosphate receptor (ITPR3), an intracellular Ca2+ channel that is not normally expressed in healthy hepatocytes. ITPR3 expression was upregulated, at least in part, by a combination of demethylation of the ITPR3 promoter region and the increased transcriptional activity of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). Additionally, expression of pro-inflammatory interleukins and necrotic surface area were less pronounced in livers of control animals compared to liver-specific ITPR3 KO mice subjected to hepatic damage. Corroborating these findings, ITPR3 expression and activation of NFAT were observed in hepatocytes of liver biopsies from patients who underwent liver ischemia caused by thrombosis after organ transplant. Together, these results are consistent with the idea that ITPR3 expression in hepatocytes plays a protective role during hepatic injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic alterations in cancer cells can influence the immune system to favor tumor growth. In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, physiological interactions between B cells and the germinal center microenvironment are coopted to sustain cancer cell proliferation. We found that follicular lymphoma patients harbor a recurrent hotspot mutation targeting tyrosine 132 (Y132D) in cathepsin S (CTSS) that enhances protein activity. CTSS regulates antigen processing and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-mediated immune responses. Loss of CTSS activity reduces lymphoma growth by limiting communication with CD4+ T follicular helper cells while inducing antigen diversification and activation of CD8+ T cells. Overall, our results suggest that CTSS inhibition has non-redundant therapeutic potential to enhance anti-tumor immune responses in indolent and aggressive lymphomas.

Abstract: Summary
The type 2 cytokine-high asthma endotype (T2H) is characterized by IL-13-driven mucus obstruction of the airways. To further investigate this incompletely understood pathobiology, we characterize IL-13 effects on human airway epithelial cell cultures using single-cell RNA sequencing, finding that IL-13 generates a distinctive transcriptional state for each cell type. Specifically, we discover a mucus secretory program induced by IL-13 in all cell types which converts both mucus and defense secretory cells into a metaplastic state with emergent mucin production and secretion, while leading to ER stress and cell death in ciliated cells. The IL-13-remodeled epithelium secretes a pathologic, mucin-imbalanced, and innate immunity-depleted proteome that arrests mucociliary motion. Signatures of IL-13-induced cellular remodeling are mirrored by transcriptional signatures characteristic of the nasal airway epithelium within T2H versus T2-low asthmatic children. Our results reveal the epithelium-wide scope of T2H asthma and present candidate therapeutic targets for restoring normal epithelial function.

Abstract: Summary
Despite key roles in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome organization, the mechanism by which cohesin rings are loaded onto DNA is still unknown. Here we combine biochemical approaches and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize a cohesin loading intermediate in which DNA is locked between two gates that lead into the cohesin ring. Building on this structural framework, we design experiments to establish the order of events during cohesin loading. In an initial step, DNA traverses an N-terminal kleisin gate that is first opened upon ATP binding and then closed as the cohesin loader locks the DNA against the ATPase gate. ATP hydrolysis will lead to ATPase gate opening to complete DNA entry. Whether DNA loading is successful or results in loop extrusion might be dictated by a conserved kleisin N-terminal tail that guides the DNA through the kleisin gate. Our results establish the molecular basis for cohesin loading onto DNA.

Abstract: Summary
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are critically involved in hippocampal theta generation, but much less is known about the role of nicotinic AChRs (nAChRs). Here we provide evidence that α7 nAChRs expressed on interneurons, particularly those in oriens lacunosum moleculare (OLM), also regulate hippocampal theta generation. Local hippocampal infusion of a selective α7 nAChR antagonist significantly reduces hippocampal theta power and impairs Y-maze spontaneous alternation performance in freely moving mice. By knocking out receptors in different neuronal subpopulations, we find that α7 nAChRs expressed in OLM interneurons regulate theta generation. Our in vitro slice studies indicate that α7 nAChR activation increases OLM neuron activity that, in turn, enhances pyramidal cell excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Our study also suggests that mAChR activation promotes transient theta generation, while α7 nAChR activation facilitates future theta generation by similar stimulations, revealing a complex mechanism whereby cholinergic signaling modulates different aspects of hippocampal theta oscillations through different receptor subtypes.
