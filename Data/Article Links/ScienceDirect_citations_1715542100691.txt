Abstract: Summary
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, inactivating mutations in the insulin/IGF-1 receptor, DAF-2, result in a 2-fold increase in lifespan mediated by DAF-16, a FOXO-family transcription factor. Downstream protein activities that directly regulate longevity during impaired insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) are poorly characterized. Here, we use global cysteine-reactivity profiling to identify protein activity changes during impaired IIS. Upon confirming that cysteine reactivity is a good predictor of functionality in C. elegans, we profiled cysteine-reactivity changes between daf-2 and daf-16;daf-2 mutants, and identified 40 proteins that display a >2-fold change. Subsequent RNAi-mediated knockdown studies revealed that lbp-3 and K02D7.1 knockdown caused significant increases in lifespan and dauer formation. The proteins encoded by these two genes, LBP-3 and K02D7.1, are implicated in intracellular fatty acid transport and purine metabolism, respectively. These studies demonstrate that cysteine-reactivity profiling can be complementary to abundance-based transcriptomic and proteomic studies, serving to identify uncharacterized mediators of C. elegans longevity.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of prostate epithelial progenitor cells is important in prostate development and prostate diseases. Our previous study demonstrated a function of autocrine cholinergic signaling (ACS) in promoting prostate cancer growth and castration resistance. However, whether or not such ACS also plays a role in prostate development is unknown. Here, we report that ACS promoted the proliferation and inhibited the differentiation of prostate epithelial progenitor cells in organotypic cultures. These results were confirmed by ex vivo lineage tracing assays and in vivo renal capsule recombination assays. Moreover, we found that M3 cholinergic receptor (CHRM3) was upregulated in a large subset of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues compared with normal tissues. Activation of CHRM3 also promoted the proliferation of BPH cells. Together, our findings identify a role of ACS in maintaining prostate epithelial progenitor cells in the proliferating state, and blockade of ACS may have clinical implications for the management of BPH.

Abstract: Summary
The plasticity of pluripotent stem cells provides new possibilities for studying development, degeneration, and regeneration. Protocols for the differentiation of retinal organoids from embryonic stem cells have been developed, which either recapitulate complete eyecup morphogenesis or maximize photoreceptor genesis. Here, we have developed a protocol for the efficient generation of large, 3D-stratified retinal organoids that does not require evagination of optic-vesicle-like structures, which so far limited the organoid yield. Analysis of gene expression in individual organoids, cell birthdating, and interorganoid variation indicate efficient, reproducible, and temporally regulated retinogenesis. Comparative analysis of a transgenic reporter for PAX6, a master regulator of retinogenesis, shows expression in similar cell types in mouse in vivo, and in mouse and human retinal organoids. Early or late Notch signaling inhibition forces cell differentiation, generating organoids enriched with cone or rod photoreceptors, respectively, demonstrating the power of our improved organoid system for future research in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Smoothened belongs to the class of atypical G protein-coupled receptors and serves as the transducing molecule in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Hh proteins comprise a family of secreted, cholesterol-modified ligands, which act both as morphogens and as signaling molecules. Binding of Hh proteins to their direct receptor, the transmembrane protein Patched-1, relieves Smoothened from tonal inhibition by Patched-1 and causes the translocation of Smoothened into the cilium. Here, the Hh signaling cascade is initiated and results in transcriptional activation of Hh target genes such as gli1 or patched-1. This induces a plethora of physiological outcomes including normal embryonic development, but also cancer, which is the reason why scientists aim to develop strategies to manipulate as well as monitor Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling. The zebrafish has emerged as a valuable tool for the assessment of Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling. In this chapter we thus describe how Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling can be monitored and also quantified using zebrafish embryos.

Abstract: Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) grow slowly after cultivation from animals, however, after an extended period of cultivation, their growth accelerates. We found that SWAP-70 deficient MEFs failed to increase growth rates. They maintain normal growth rates and proliferation cycles for at least 5 years. Complementing SWAP-70 deficiency in one of these MEF clones, MEF1F2, by expressing human SWAP-70 resulted in fast growth of the cells after further cultivation for a long period. The resulting cells show a transformation phenotype, since they grow on top of each other and do not show contact inhibition. This phenotype was reverted when sanguinarine, a putative SWAP-70 inhibitor, was added. Two SWAP-70 expressing clones were examined in detail. Even after cell density became very high their cdc2 and NFκB were still activated suggesting that they do not stop growing. One of the clones formed colonies in soft agar and formed tumors in nude mice. Lately, one more clone became transformed being able to make colonies in soft agar. We maintain 4 human SWAP-70 expressing MEF1F2 cell lines. Three out of 4 clones exhibited transforming phenotypes. The mouse SWAP-70 gene also promoted transformation of MEFs. Taken together our data suggest that SWAP-70 is not a typical oncogene, but is required for spontaneous transformation of MEFs.

Keratocytes are induced to produce collagen type II: A new strategy for in vivo corneal matrix regeneration,

Abstract: The stroma, the middle layer of the cornea, is a connective tissue making up most of the corneal thickness. The stromal extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of highly organised lamellae which are made up of tightly packed fibrils primarily composed of collagens type I and V. This layer is interspersed with keratocytes, mesenchymal cells of neural crest origin. We have previously shown that adult corneal keratocytes exhibit phenotypic plasticity and can be induced into a neuronal phenotype. In the current study we evaluated the potential of keratocytes to produce collagen type II via phenotypic reprogramming with exogenous chondrogenic factors. The cornea presents a challenge to tissue engineers owing to its high level of organisation and the phenotypic instability of keratocytes. Traditional approaches based on a scar model do not support the engineering of functional stromal tissue. Type II collagen is not found in the adult cornea but is reported to be expressed during corneal development, raising the possibility of using such an approach to regenerate the corneal ECM. Keratocytes in culture and within intact normal and diseased tissue were induced to produce collagen type II upon treatment with transforming growth factor Beta3 (TGFβ3) and dexamethasone. In vivo treatment of rat corneas also resulted in collagen type II deposition and a threefold increase in corneal hardness and elasticity. Furthermore, the treatment of corneas and subsequent deposition of collagen type II did not cause opacity, fibrosis or scarring. The induction of keratocytes with specific exogenous factors and resulting deposition of type II collagen in the stroma can potentially be controlled by withdrawal of the factors. This might be a promising new approach for in vivo corneal regeneration strategies aimed at increasing corneal integrity in diseases associated with weakened ectatic corneal tissue such as keratoconus.

Abstract: Chemosensitization and enhanced delivery to solid tumor are widely explored strategies to augment the anticancer efficacy of existing chemotherapeutics agents. The aim of current research was to investigate the role of low dose Noscapine (Nos) in potentiating docetaxel cytotoxicity and enhancing tumor penetration of nanocarriers. The objectives are; (1) To evaluate the chemo-sensitizing effect of Nos in combination with docetaxel (DTX), and to elucidate the possible mechanism (2) To investigate the effect of low dose Nos on tumor stroma and enhancing nanocarrier uptake in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) bearing nude mice. Cytotoxicity and flow cytometry analysis of DTX in Nos (4µM) pre-treated MDA-MB-231 cells showed 3.0-fold increase in cell killing and 30% increase in number of late apoptotic cells, respectively. Stress transducer p38 phosphorylation was significantly upregulated with Nos exposure. DTX showed remarkable downregulation in expression of bcl-2, survivin and pAKT in Nos pre-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Nos pre-sensitization significantly (p<0.02) enhanced the anti-migration effect of DTX. In vivo studies in orthotopic TNBC tumor bearing mice showed marked reduction in tumor collagen-I levels and significantly (p<0.03) higher intra-tumoral uptake of coumarin-6 loaded PEGylated liposomes (7-fold) in Nos treated group. Chemo-sensitization and anti-fibrotic effect of Nos could be a promising approach to increase anticancer efficacy of DTX which can be used for other nanomedicinal products.

Abstract: In the nervous system, axons transmit information in the form of electrical impulses over long distances. The speed of impulse conduction is enhanced by myelin, a lipid-rich membrane that wraps around axons. Myelin also is required for the long-term health of axons by providing metabolic support. Accordingly, myelin deficiencies are implicated in a wide range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, intellectual disabilities, and neurodegenerative conditions. Central nervous system myelin is formed by glial cells called oligodendrocytes. During development, oligodendrocyte precursor cells migrate from their origins to their target axons, extend long membrane processes that wrap axons, and produce the proteins and lipids that provide myelin membrane with its unique characteristics. Myelination is a dynamic process that involves intricate interactions between multiple cell types. Therefore, an in vivo myelination model, such as the zebrafish, which allows for live observation of cell dynamics and cell-to-cell interactions, is well suited for investigating oligodendrocyte development. Zebrafish offer several advantages to investigating myelination, including the use of transgenic reporter lines, live imaging, forward genetic screens, chemical screens, and reverse genetic approaches. This chapter will describe how these tools and approaches have provided new insights into the regulatory mechanisms that guide myelination.

Abstract: Summary
A poor understanding of the mechanisms by which antibiotics traverse the outer membrane remains a considerable obstacle to the development of novel Gram-negative antibiotics. Herein, we demonstrate that the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli becomes susceptible to the narrow-spectrum antibiotic vancomycin during growth at low temperatures. Heterologous expression of an Enterococcus vanHBX vancomycin resistance cluster in E. coli confirmed that the mechanism of action was through inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. To understand the nature of vancomycin permeability, we screened for strains of E. coli that displayed resistance to vancomycin at low temperature. Surprisingly, we observed that mutations in outer membrane biosynthesis suppressed vancomycin activity. Subsequent chemical analysis of lipopolysaccharide from vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant strains confirmed that suppression was correlated with truncations in the core oligosaccharide of lipopolysaccharide. These unexpected observations challenge the current understanding of outer membrane permeability, and provide new chemical insights into the susceptibility of E. coli to glycopeptide antibiotics.

Abstract: This chapter presents a detailed methodology for somatic cell nuclear transfer—cloning of zebrafish. We aim to place the reader in a virtual lab experience to assist acquisition of the technical skills required for reproducing the published protocol. All materials, including catalog numbers for reagents and techniques for their preparation, are provided. Our protocols describe laser inactivation of egg chromosomes, the transfer of a cell through the oocyte micropyle, and spontaneous activation of the reconstructed embryo. High-quality eggs are the key to cloning success, and Chinook salmon ovarian fluid is indispensable for keeping eggs arrested at the metaphase of meiosis II. This protocol continues to be refined by our laboratory. However, naive investigators should be able to apply it in its present form to generate cloned zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
High mucosal and fecal concentrations of the antimicrobial siderophore-binding peptide Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) are observed in inflammatory bowel disease. However, Lcn2 function in chronic intestinal inflammation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Lcn2 protects from early-onset colitis and spontaneous emergence of right-sided colonic tumors resulting from IL-10 deficiency. Exacerbated inflammation in Lcn2–/–/Il10–/– mice is driven by IL-6, which also controls tumorigenesis. Lcn2–/–/Il10–/– mice exhibit profound alterations in gut microbial composition, which contributes to inflammation and tumorigenesis, as demonstrated by the transmissibility of the phenotype and protection conferred by antibiotics. Specifically, facultative pathogenic Alistipes spp. utilize enterobactin as iron source, bloom in Lcn2–/–/Il10–/– mice, and are sufficient to induce colitis and right-sided tumors when transferred into Il10–/– mice. Our results demonstrate that Lcn2 protects against intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis associated with alterations in the microbiota.

Abstract: Peripheral sensory organs and ganglia found in the vertebrate head arise during embryonic development from distinct ectodermal thickenings, called cranial sensory placodes (adenohypophyseal, olfactory, lens, trigeminal, epibranchial, and otic). A series of patterning events leads to the establishment of these placodes. Subsequently, these placodes undergo specific morphogenetic movements and cell-type specification in order to shape the final placodal derivatives and to produce differentiated cell types necessary for their function. In this chapter, we will focus on recent studies in the zebrafish that have advanced our understanding of cranial sensory placode development. We will summarize the signaling events and their molecular effectors guiding the formation of the so-called preplacodal region, and the subsequent subdivision of this region along the anteroposterior axis that gives rise to specific placode identities as well as those controlling morphogenesis and neurogenesis. Finally, we will highlight the approaches used in zebrafish that have been established to precisely label cell populations, to follow their development, and/or to characterize cell fates within a specific placode.

Abstract: Summary
The identification of breast cancer cell subpopulations featuring truly malignant stem cell qualities is a challenge due to the complexity of the disease and lack of general markers. By combining extensive single-cell gene expression profiling with three functional strategies for cancer stem cell enrichment including anchorage-independent culture, hypoxia, and analyses of low-proliferative, label-retaining cells derived from mammospheres, we identified distinct stem cell clusters in breast cancer. Estrogen receptor (ER)α+ tumors featured a clear hierarchical organization with switch-like and gradual transitions between different clusters, illustrating how breast cancer cells transfer between discrete differentiation states in a sequential manner. ERα− breast cancer showed less prominent clustering but shared a quiescent cancer stem cell pool with ERα+ cancer. The cellular organization model was supported by single-cell data from primary tumors. The findings allow us to understand the organization of breast cancers at the single-cell level, thereby permitting better identification and targeting of cancer stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
The cyanobacterial hepatotoxin microcystin is assembled at a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) complex. The enormous structural diversity of this peptide, which is also found in closely related strains, is the result of frequent recombination events and point mutations. Here, we have compared the in vitro activation profiles of related monospecific and multispecific modules that either strictly incorporate leucine or arginine or incorporate chemically diverse amino acids in parallel into microcystin. By analyzing di- and tri-domain proteins we have dissected the role of adenylation and condensation domains for substrate specificity. We have further analyzed the role of subdomains and provide evidence for an extended gatekeeping function for the condensation domains of multispecific modules. By reproducing natural point mutations, we could convert a monospecific module into a multispecific module. Our findings may inspire novel synthetic biology approaches and demonstrate how recombination platforms of NRPSs have developed in nature.

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that the clinical use of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is hampered by heterogeneity, poor neuronal yield and low survival rate. Recently, we reported that retrovirus-delivered human arginine decarboxylase (hADC) genes improve cell survival against oxidative insult in murine NPCs in vitro. This study investigates whether the induced expression of hADC gene in mNPCs induces any significant change in the cell fate commitment. The evaluation of induced hADC gene function was assessed by knockdown of hADC gene using specific siRNA. The hADC gene delivery triggered higher expression of N-CAM, cell adhesion molecule and MAP-2, neuronal marker. However, the hADC gene knockdown showed downregulation of N-CAM and MAP-2 expression suggesting that hADC gene delivery favors cell fate commitment of mNPCs towards neuronal lineage. Neurite outgrowth was significantly longer in the hADC infected cells. The neurotrophic signal, BDNF aided in the neuronal commitment, differentiation, and maturation of hADC-mNPCs through PI3K and ERK1/2 activation. The induction of neuron-like differentiation is believed to be regulated by the expression of GSK-3β and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that hADC gene delivery favors cell fate commitment of mNPCs towards neuronal lineage, bring new advances in the field of neurogenesis and cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we show that the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA1) is expressed by a defined population of type 1 stem cells and type 2a precursor cells in the adult mouse dentate gyrus. LPA1, in contrast to Nestin, also marks the quiescent stem cell population. Combining LPA1-GFP with EGFR and prominin-1 expression, we have enabled the prospective separation of both proliferative and non-proliferative precursor cell populations. Transcriptional profiling of the isolated proliferative precursor cells suggested immune mechanisms and cytokine signaling as molecular regulators of adult hippocampal precursor cell proliferation. In addition to LPA1 being a marker of this important stem cell population, we also show that the corresponding ligand LPA is directly involved in the regulation of adult hippocampal precursor cell proliferation and neurogenesis, an effect that can be attributed to LPA signaling via the AKT and MAPK pathways.

Abstract: Inflammasome NLRP3 plays a crucial role in the process of colitis and colitis­-associated colon cancer. Even though much is known regarding the NLRP3 inflammasome that regulates pro-inflammatory cytokine release in innate immune cells, the role of NLRP3 in non-immune cells is still unclear. In this study, we showed that NLRP3 was highly expressed in mesenchymal-like colon cancer cells (SW620), and was upregulated by tumor necrosis factors-α (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) respectively, during EMT in colon cancer epithelial cells HCT116 and HT29. Knockdown of NLRP3 retained epithelial spindle-like morphology of HCT116 and HT29 cells and reversed the mesenchymal characteristic of SW620 cells, indicated by the decreased expression of vimentin and MMP9 and increased expression of E-cadherin. In addition, knockdown of NLRP3 in colorectal carcinoma cells displayed diminished cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, during the EMT process induced by TNF-α or TGF-β1, the cleaved caspase-1 and ASC speck were not detected, indicating that NLRP3 functions in an inflammasome-independent way. Further studies demonstrated that NLRP3 protein expression was regulated by NF-κB signaling in TNF-α or TGF-β1-induced EMT, as verified by the NF-κB inhibitor Bay 11-7082. Moreover, NLRP3 knockdown reduced the expression of Snail1, indicating that NLRP3 may promote EMT through regulating Snail1. In summary, our results showed that the NLRP3 expression, not the inflammasome activation, was required for EMT in colorectal cancer cells.

Abstract: The discovery that the regenerative properties of bone marrow multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) could collaterally favor neoplastic progression has led to a great interest in the function of these cells in tumors. However, the effect of BM-MSCs on colonization, a rate-limiting step of the metastatic cascade, is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of BM-MSCs on metastatic outgrowth of B16-F10 melanoma cells. In in vitro experiments, direct co-culture assays demonstrated that BM-MSCs stimulated the proliferation of B16-F10 cells in a dose-dependent manner. For in vivo experiments, luciferase-expressing B16-F10 cells were injected through tail vein and mice were subsequently treated with four systemic injections of BM-MSCs. In vivo bioluminescent imaging during 16 days demonstrated that BM-MSCs enhanced the colonization of lungs by B16-F10 cells, which correlated with a 2-fold increase in the number of metastatic foci. Flow cytometry analysis of lungs demonstrated that although mice harboring B16-F10 metastases displayed more endothelial cells, CD4 T and CD8 T lymphocytes in the lungs in comparison to metastases-free mice, BM-MSCs did not alter the number of these cells. Interestingly, BM-MSCs inoculation resulted in a 2-fold increase in the number of CD11b+ myeloid cells in the lungs of melanoma-bearing animals, a cell population previously described to organize “premetastatic niches” in experimental models. These findings indicate that BM-MSCs provide support to B16-F10 cells to overcome the constraints that limit metastatic outgrowth and that these effects might involve the interplay between BM-MSCs, CD11b+ myeloid cells and tumor cells.

Abstract: This work aimed to characterize the uptake of folate and glucose by breast cancer cells and to study the effect of lactate upon the transport of these nutrients and upon cell viability, proliferation and migration capacity. Data obtained showed that: a) MCF7 cells uptake 3H-folic acid (3H-FA) at physiological but not at acidic pH; b) T47D cells accumulate 3H-FA and 14C-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (14C-5-MTHF) more efficiently at acidic than at physiological pH; c) 3H-deoxyglucose (3H-DG) uptake by T47D cells is sodium-independent, inhibited by cytochalasin B (CYT B) and stimulated by insulin. Regarding the effect of lactate, in T47D cells, acute (26min) and chronic (24h) exposure to lactic acid (LA) stimulated 3H-FA uptake. Acute exposure to LA also stimulated 3H-DG uptake and chronic exposure to LA significantly stimulated T47D cell migratory capacity. In conclusion, the transport of folates is strikingly different in two phenotypically similar breast cancer cell lines: MCF7 and T47D cells. Additionally, lactate seems to act as a signaling molecule which increases the uptake of nutrients and promotes the migration capacity of T47D cells.

Abstract: Cytokinesis in neural progenitors occurs with specialized constraints due to their highly polarized structure and the need for both symmetric and asymmetric divisions. They must produce proper numbers of progenitors, neurons, and glia in a precise order. Yet very few functional studies of cytokinesis have been done in the developing brain. To elucidate mechanisms of cytokinesis during brain development, we designed a novel method to study cytokinesis in whole mount “slabs” of embryonic mouse cerebral cortex. It takes advantage of cytokinesis occurring on the ventricular surface of the cortex and allows examination of cytokinesis across many cells in the context of an intact brain tissue. The cortical slabs can be fixed for immunohistochemistry or used in live imaging experiments. In particular, we investigated mutants of the Kinesin-6, Kif20b, which show defects in cytokinetic abscission and have small brains. Here, we describe how to dissect neocortex from embryonic cerebral hemispheres, immunostain the cortical slabs for cytokinetic midbodies and other structures, and image the apical surface. We show how to quantitatively analyze apical structures including midbody numbers, organization, and morphology. New images and analyses of Kif20bmagoo loss of function mutants are shown. Applying and adapting these types of analyses to other cytoskeletal proteins and mouse mutants will help advance our understanding on how the embryonic neuroepithelium generates neurons and builds the brain.

Abstract: Transcriptomic studies are important tools for understanding the development and function of the different cell types that make up complex tissues. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a valuable organism for modeling key aspects of vertebrate development, cell biology, and human disease. However, the small size of individual larvae and relative scarcity of certain cell types in zebrafish can hamper efforts to collect enough pure material for cell type-specific transcriptomic studies. Thus, there is a need in the zebrafish field for spatially and temporally resolved gene expression assays. This chapter will discuss the general principles behind the TU-tagging method to isolate cell type-specific RNAs and provide guidance in designing and executing TU-tagging experiments in zebrafish.

Abstract: The enteric nervous system (ENS) forms intimate connections with many other intestinal cell types, including immune cells and bacterial consortia resident in the intestinal lumen. In this review, we highlight contributions of the zebrafish model to understanding interactions among these cells. Zebrafish is a powerful model for forward genetic screens, several of which have uncovered genes previously unknown to be important for ENS development. More recently, zebrafish has emerged as a model for testing functions of genes identified in human patients or large-scale human susceptibility screens. In several cases, zebrafish studies have revealed mechanisms connecting intestinal symptoms with other, seemingly unrelated disease phenotypes. Importantly, chemical library screens in zebrafish have provided startling new insights into potential effects of common drugs on ENS development. A key feature of the zebrafish model is the ability to rear large numbers of animals germ free or in association with only specific bacterial species. Studies utilizing these approaches have demonstrated the importance of bacterial signals for normal intestinal development. These types of studies also show how luminal bacteria and the immune system can contribute to inflammatory processes that can feedback to influence ENS development. The excellent optical properties of zebrafish embryos and larvae, coupled with the ease of generating genetically marked cells of both the host and its resident bacteria, allow visualization of multiple intestinal cell types in living larvae and should promote a more in-depth understanding of intestinal cell interactions, especially interactions between other intestinal cell types and the ENS.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium species, the parasitic agents of malaria, invade erythrocytes to reproduce, resulting in erythrocyte loss. However, a greater loss is caused by the elimination of uninfected erythrocytes, sometimes long after infection has been cleared. Using a mouse model, we found that Plasmodium infection induces the generation of anti-self antibodies that bind to the surface of uninfected erythrocytes from infected, but not uninfected, mice. These antibodies recognize phosphatidylserine, which is exposed on the surface of a fraction of uninfected erythrocytes during malaria. We find that phosphatidylserine-exposing erythrocytes are reticulocytes expressing high levels of CD47, a “do-not-eat-me” signal, but the binding of anti-phosphatidylserine antibodies mediates their phagocytosis, contributing to anemia. In human patients with late postmalarial anemia, we found a strong inverse correlation between the levels of anti-phosphatidylserine antibodies and plasma hemoglobin, suggesting a similar role in humans. Inhibition of this pathway may be exploited for treating malarial anemia.

Abstract: Summary
Bone marrow niches for hematopoietic progenitor cells are not well defined despite their critical role in blood homeostasis. We previously found that cells expressing osteocalcin, a marker of mature osteolineage cells, regulate the production of thymic-seeding T lymphoid progenitors. Here, using a selective cell deletion strategy, we demonstrate that a subset of mesenchymal cells expressing osterix, a marker of bone precursors in the adult, serve to regulate the maturation of early B lymphoid precursors by promoting pro-B to pre-B cell transition through insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production. Loss of Osx+ cells or Osx-specific deletion of IGF-1 led to a failure of B cell maturation and the impaired adaptive immune response. These data highlight the notion that bone marrow is a composite of specialized niches formed by pairings of specific mesenchymal cells with parenchymal stem or lineage committed progenitor cells, thereby providing distinctive functional units to regulate hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Small non-coding RNAs have emerged as key modulators of viral infection. However, with the exception of hepatitis C virus, which requires the liver-specific microRNA (miRNA)-122, the interactions of RNA viruses with host miRNAs remain poorly characterized. Here, we used crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of the Argonaute (AGO) proteins to characterize strengths and specificities of miRNA interactions in the context of 15 different RNA virus infections, including several clinically relevant pathogens. Notably, replication of pestiviruses, a major threat to milk and meat industries, critically depended on the interaction of cellular miR-17 and let-7 with the viral 3′ UTR. Unlike canonical miRNA interactions, miR-17 and let-7 binding enhanced pestivirus translation and RNA stability. miR-17 sequestration by pestiviruses conferred reduced AGO binding and functional de-repression of cellular miR-17 targets, thereby altering the host transcriptome. These findings generalize the concept of RNA virus dependence on cellular miRNAs and connect virus-induced miRNA sequestration to host transcriptome regulation.

Abstract: Neural stem cells and progenitor cells (NPCs) are increasingly appreciated to hold great promise for regenerative medicine to treat CNS injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. However, evidence for effective stimulation of neuronal production from endogenous or transplanted NPCs for neuron replacement with small molecules remains limited. To identify novel chemical entities/targets for neurogenesis, we had established a NPC phenotypic screen assay and validated it using known small-molecule neurogenesis inducers. Through screening small molecule libraries with annotated targets, we identified BET bromodomain inhibition as a novel mechanism for enhancing neurogenesis. BET bromodomain proteins, Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4 were found to be downregulated in NPCs upon differentiation, while their levels remain unaltered in proliferating NPCs. Consistent with the pharmacological study using bromodomain selective inhibitor (+)-JQ-1, knockdown of each BET protein resulted in an increase in the number of neurons with simultaneous reduction in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Gene expression profiling analysis demonstrated that BET bromodomain inhibition induced a broad but specific transcription program enhancing directed differentiation of NPCs into neurons while suppressing cell cycle progression and gliogenesis. Together, these results highlight a crucial role of BET proteins as epigenetic regulators in NPC development and suggest a therapeutic potential of BET inhibitors in treating brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The host gut microbiota varies across species and individuals but is relatively stable over time within an individual. How the host selectively shapes the microbiota is largely unclear. Here, we show that fecal microRNA (miRNA)-mediated inter-species gene regulation facilitates host control of the gut microbiota. miRNAs are abundant in mouse and human fecal samples and present within extracellular vesicles. Cell-specific loss of the miRNA-processing enzyme, Dicer, identified intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and Hopx-positive cells as predominant fecal miRNA sources. These miRNAs can enter bacteria, such as F. nucleatum and E. coli, specifically regulate bacterial gene transcripts, and affect bacterial growth. IEC-miRNA-deficient (Dicer1ΔIEC) mice exhibit uncontrolled gut microbiota and exacerbated colitis, and WT fecal miRNA transplantation restores fecal microbes and ameliorates colitis. These findings identify both a physiologic role by which fecal miRNA shapes the gut microbiota and a potential strategy for manipulating the microbiome.

Abstract: Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive cancer, characterized by rapid progression, along with late metastasis and poor patient prognosis. It is resistant to many forms of standard anti-cancer treatment. In this study, we determined the effect of secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4), a Wnt pathway inhibitor, on cancer cell proliferation and metabolism using the JU77 mesothelioma cell line. Treatment with sFRP4 (250pg/ml) resulted in a significant reduction of cell proliferation. The addition of the Wnt activator Wnt3a (250pg/ml) or sFRP4 had no significant effect on ATP production and glucose utilisation in JU77 cells at both the 24 and 48h time points examined. We also examined their effect on Akt and Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) phosphorylation, which are both important components of Wnt signalling and glucose metabolism. We found that protein phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β varied over the 24h and 48h time points, with constitutive phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 (pAkt) decreasing to its most significant level when treated with Wnt3a+sFRP4 at the 24h time point. A significant reduction in the level of Cytochrome c oxidase was observed at the 48h time point, when sFRP4 and Wnt3a were added in combination. We conclude that sFRP4 may function, in part, to reduce/alter cancer cell metabolism, which may lead to sensitisation of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics, or even cell death.

Abstract: The present study was designed to assess the possible protective effects of Quercetin (QUER), a flavonoid with well-known pharmacological effects, against Dichlorvos (DDVP)-induced toxicity in vitro using HCT116 cells. The cytotoxicity was monitored by cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, anti-oxidant enzyme activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and DNA fragmentation. The apoptosis was assessed through the measurement of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and caspase activation. The results indicated that pretreatment of HCT116 cells with QUER, 2 h prior to DDVP exposure, significantly decreased the DDVP-induced cell death, inhibited the ROS generation, modulated the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced the MDA level. The reductions in mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation were also attenuated by QUER. These findings suggest that dietary QUER can protect HCT116 cells against DDVP-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from human urine-derived cells (hUCs) provides a convenient and non-invasive way to obtain patient-specific iPSCs. However, many isolated hUCs exhibit very poor proliferation and are difficult to reprogram. In this study, we optimized reprogramming approaches for hUCs with very poor proliferation. We report here that a compound cocktail containing cyclic pifithrin-a (a P53 inhibitor), A-83-01, CHIR99021, thiazovivin, NaB, and PD0325901 significantly improves the reprogramming efficiency (170-fold more) for hUCs. In addition, we showed that replacement of Matrigel with autologous hUC feeders can overcome the reprogramming failure due to the massive cell death that occurs during delivery of reprogramming factors. In summary, we describe improved approaches to enable iPSC generation from hUCs that were otherwise difficult to reprogram, a valuable asset for banking patient-specific iPSCs.

Abstract: The human NTERA2/D1 (NT2) cells generate postmitotic neurons (NT2N cells) upon retinoic acid (RA) treatment and are functionally integrated in the host tissue following grafting into the rodent and human brain, thus representing a promising source for neuronal replacement therapy. Yet the major limitations of this model are the lengthy differentiation procedure and its low efficiency, although recent studies suggest that the differentiation process can be shortened to less than 1week using nucleoside analogues. To explore whether short-term exposure of NT2 cells to the nucleoside analogue cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (AraC) could be a suitable method to efficiently generate mature neurons, we conducted a neurochemical and morphometric characterization of AraC-differentiated NT2N (AraC/NT2N) neurons and improved the differentiation efficiency by modifying the cell culture schedule. Moreover, we analyzed the neurotransmitter phenotypes of AraC/NT2N neurons. Cultures obtained by treatment with AraC were highly enriched in postmitotic neurons and essentially composed of dual glutamatergic/cholinergic neurons, which contrasts with the preferential GABAergic phenotype that we found after RA differentiation. Taken together, our results further reinforce the notion NT2 cells are a versatile source of neuronal phenotypes and provide a new encouraging platform for studying mechanisms of neuronal differentiation and for exploring neuronal replacement strategies.

Abstract: Zebrafish is an excellent genetic and developmental model for the study of vertebrate development and disease. Its ability to produce an abundance of transparent, externally developed embryos has facilitated large-scale genetic and chemical screens for the identification of critical genes and chemical factors that modulate developmental pathways. These studies can have profound implications for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of human diseases. Recent advancements in molecular and genomic studies have provided valuable tools and resources for comprehensive and high-resolution analysis of epigenomes during cell specification and lineage differentiation throughout development. In this chapter, we describe two simple methods to evaluate protein–DNA interaction and chromatin architecture in erythrocytes from adult zebrafish. These are chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq). These techniques, together with gene expression profiling, are useful for analyzing epigenomic regulation of cell specification, differentiation, and function during zebrafish development in both normal and disease models

Abstract: Radioligand binding assays provide sensitive and quantitative information about guanine nucleotide protein G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expression and affinity for a wide variety of ligands, making them essential for drug structure-activity studies and basic GPCR research. Three basic radioligand binding protocols, saturation, indirect (competition, displacement, or modulation), and kinetic binding assays, are used to assess GPCR expression (Bmax), equilibrium dissociation constants for radioligands (Kd) and nonradioactive ligands (Ki), association and dissociation rates, and to distinguish competitive and allosteric mechanisms of GPCR-ligand interactions. Nonspecific radioligand binding may be mitigated by appropriate choices of reaction conditions. Radioligand depletion (bound radioactivity >10% of total radioligand), which compromises accuracy of Kd and Ki measurements, can be limited by adjusting receptor concentration and appropriate radioligand choice. Accurate Kd and Ki values in saturation and indirect binding assays depend on binding equilibrium. Equilibration time for high-affinity ligands, with slow dissociation rates, may require much extended incubation times or increased incubation temperature.

Abstract: Summary
Pandemic influenza viruses modulate proinflammatory responses that can lead to immunopathogenesis. We present an extensive and systematic profiling of lipids, metabolites, and proteins in respiratory compartments of ferrets infected with either 1918 or 2009 human pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses. Integrative analysis of high-throughput omics data with virologic and histopathologic data uncovered relationships between host responses and phenotypic outcomes of viral infection. Proinflammatory lipid precursors in the trachea following 1918 infection correlated with severe tracheal lesions. Using an algorithm to infer cell quantity changes from gene expression data, we found enrichment of distinct T cell subpopulations in the trachea. There was also a predicted increase in inflammatory monocytes in the lung of 1918 virus-infected animals that was sustained throughout infection. This study presents a unique resource to the influenza research community and demonstrates the utility of an integrative systems approach for characterization of lipid metabolism alterations underlying respiratory responses to viruses.

Abstract: In order to identify the cellular factors involved in human melanogenesis, we carried out shRNA-mediated loss-of-function screening in conjunction with induction of melanogenesis by 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG) in human melanoma cells using biochemical and visual assays. Gene targets of the shRNAs (that caused loss of OAG-induced melanogenesis) and their pathways, as determined by bioinformatics, revealed involvement of proteins that regulate cell stress response, mitochondrial functions, proliferation, and apoptosis. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the mitochondrial stress chaperone mortalin is crucial for melanogenesis. Upregulation of mortalin was closely associated with melanogenesis in in vitro cell-based assays and clinical samples of keloids with hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, its knockdown resulted in compromised melanogenesis. The data proposed mortalin as an important protein that may be targeted to manipulate pigmentation for cosmetic and related disease therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
The promiscuous functions of proteins are an important reservoir of functional novelty in protein evolution, but the molecular basis for binding promiscuity remains elusive. We used ancestral protein reconstruction to experimentally characterize evolutionary intermediates in the functional expansion of the polar amino acid-binding protein family, which has evolved to bind a variety of amino acids with high affinity and specificity. High-resolution crystal structures of an ancestral arginine-binding protein in complex with l-arginine and l-glutamine show that the promiscuous binding of l-glutamine is enabled by multi-scale conformational plasticity, water-mediated interactions, and selection of an alternative conformational substate productive for l-glutamine binding. Evolution of specialized glutamine-binding proteins from this ancestral protein was achieved by displacement of water molecules from the protein-ligand interface, reducing the entropic penalty associated with the promiscuous interaction. These results provide a structural and thermodynamic basis for the co-option of a promiscuous interaction in the evolution of binding specificity.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium falciparum parasites in the merozoite stage invade human erythrocytes and cause malaria. Invasion requires multiple interactions between merozoite ligands and erythrocyte receptors. P. falciparum reticulocyte binding homolog 5 (PfRh5) forms a complex with the PfRh5-interacting protein (PfRipr) and Cysteine-rich protective antigen (CyRPA) and binds erythrocytes via the host receptor basigin. However, the specific role that PfRipr and CyRPA play during invasion is unclear. Using P. falciparum lines conditionally expressing PfRipr and CyRPA, we show that loss of PfRipr or CyRPA function blocks growth due to the inability of merozoites to invade erythrocytes. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that PfRipr, CyRPA, and PfRh5 colocalize at the junction between merozoites and erythrocytes during invasion. PfRipr, CyRPA, and PfRipr/CyRPA/PfRh5-basigin complex is required for triggering the Ca2+ release and establishing the tight junction. Together, these results establish that the PfRh5/PfRipr/CyRPA complex is essential in the sequential molecular events leading to parasite invasion of human erythrocytes.

Abstract: Increasing heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in aged and/or insulin-resistant animal models confers benefits to healthspan and lifespan. Heat application to increase core temperature induces HSPs in metabolically important tissues, and preliminary human and animal data suggest that heated hydrotherapy is an effective method to achieve increased HSPs. However, safety concerns exist, particularly in geriatric medicine where organ and cardiovascular disease commonly will preexist. We evaluated young vervet monkeys compared to old, insulin-resistant vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) in their core temperatures, glucose tolerance, muscle HSP70 level, and selected safety biomarkers after 10 sessions of hot water immersions administered twice weekly. Hot water immersion robustly induced the heat shock response in muscles. We observed that heat-treated old and young monkeys have significantly higher muscle HSP70 than control monkeys and treatment was without significant adverse effects on organ or cardiovascular health. Heat therapy improved pancreatic responses to glucose challenge and tended to normalize glucose excursions. A trend for worsened blood pressure and glucose values in the control monkeys and improved values in heat-treated monkeys were seen to support further investigation into the safety and efficacy of this intervention for metabolic syndrome or diabetes in young or old persons unable to exercise.

Abstract: Tumor cells rely on a continued exogenous nutrient supply in order to maintain a high proliferative activity. Although a strong dependence of some tumor types on exogenous arginine sources has been reported, the mechanisms of arginine sensing by tumor cells and the impact of changes in arginine availability on translation and cell cycle regulation are not fully understood. The results presented herein state that human colorectal carcinoma cells rapidly exhaust the internal arginine sources in the absence of exogenous arginine and repress global translation by activation of the GCN2-mediated pathway and inhibition of mTOR signaling. Tumor suppressor protein p53 activation and G1/G0 cell cycle arrest support cell survival upon prolonged arginine starvation. Cells with the mutant or deleted TP53 fail to stop cell cycle progression at defined cell cycle checkpoints which appears to be associated with reduced recovery after durable metabolic stress triggered by arginine withdrawal.

Abstract: Summary
Degenerative cartilage endplate (CEP) shows decreased chondrification and increased ossification. Cartilage endplate stem cells (CESCs), with the capacity for chondro-osteogenic differentiation, are responsible for CEP restoration. CEP is avascular and hypoxic, while the physiological hypoxia is disrupted in the degenerated CEP. Hypoxia promoted chondrogenesis but inhibited osteogenesis in CESCs. This tissue-specific differentiation fate of CESCs in response to hypoxia was physiologically significant with regard to CEP maintaining chondrification and refusing ossification. MIF, a downstream target of HIF1A, is involved in cartilage and bone metabolisms, although little is known about its regulatory role in differentiation. In CESCs, MIF was identified as a key point through which HIF1A regulated the chondro-osteogenic differentiation. Unexpectedly, unlike the traditionally recognized mode, increased nuclear-expressed MIF under hypoxia was identified to act as a transcriptional regulator by interacting with the promoter of SOX9 and RUNX2. This mode of HIF1A/MIF function may represent a target for CEP degeneration therapy.

Abstract: Ferritin is a sub-family of iron binding proteins that form multi-subunit nanotype iron storage structures and prevent oxidative stress induced apoptosis. Here we describe the identification and characterization of human ferritin, heavy polypeptide 1 (FTH1) as a suppressor of the pro-apoptotic murine Bax sequence in yeast. In addition we demonstrate that FTH1 is a general pro-survival sequence since it also prevents the cell death inducing effects of copper when heterologously expressed in yeast. Although ferritins are phylogenetically widely distributed and are present in most species of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya, ferritin is conspicuously absent in most fungal species including Saccharomyces cerevisiae. An in silico analysis of the yeast proteome lead to the identification of the 161 residue RGI1 (YER067W) encoded protein as a candidate for being a yeast ferritin. In addition to sharing 20% sequence identity with the 183 residue FTH1, RGI1 also has similar pro-survival properties as ferritin when overexpressed in yeast. Analysis of recombinant protein by SDS-PAGE and by electron microscopy revealed the expected formation of higher-order structures for FTH1 that was not observed with Rgi1p. Further analysis revealed that cells overexpressing RGI1 do not show increased resistance to iron toxicity and do not have enhanced capacity to store iron. In contrast, cells lacking RGI1 were found to be hypersensitive to the toxic effects of iron. Overall, our results suggest that Rgi1p is a novel pro-survival protein whose function is not related to ferritin but nevertheless it may have a role in regulating yeast sensitivity to iron stress.

Abstract: Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (ANGPTL8)/betatrophin, a newly identified protein, is primarily expressed in the liver and regulates the glucose metabolic transition during fasting and re-feeding in mice with or without insulin resistance. These findings strongly suggest that ANGPTL8/betatrophin could be a novel glucose-lowering candidate medicine for type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ANGPTL8/betatrophin regulates glucose metabolism are poorly understood in human. Two sub-clones of HepG2 cells, ANGPTL8/betatrophin knockouts and ANGPTL8/betatrophin over-expressors, were established using TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) and through stable transfection, respectively. Over-expression of ANGPTL8/betatrophin enhanced the insulin-stimulated activation of the Akt-GSK3β or Akt-FoxO1 pathway, no matter whether the cells were present with insulin resistance or not. In contrast, knockout of ANGPTL8/betatrophin did not affect the Akt-GSK3β or Akt-FoxO1 pathway unless the HepG2 cells were preset with insulin resistance. Our results suggest that ANGPTL8/betatrophin might play an important role in glucose metabolism in the context of insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. Skewed differentiation of BM-MSCs contributes to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Yet how BM-MSC lineage commitment is regulated remains unclear. We show that ablation of p38α in Prx1+ BM-MSCs produced osteoporotic phenotypes, growth plate defects, and increased bone marrow fat, secondary to biased BM-MSC differentiation from osteoblast/chondrocyte to adipocyte and increased osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. p38α regulates BM-MSC osteogenic commitment through TAK1-NF-κB signaling and osteoclastogenesis through osteoprotegerin (OPG) production by BM-MSCs. Estrogen activates p38α to maintain OPG expression in BM-MSCs to preserve the bone. Ablation of p38α in BM-MSCs positive for Dermo1, a later BM-MSC marker, only affected osteogenic differentiation. Thus, p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in Prx1+ BM-MSCs acts to preserve the bone by promoting osteogenic lineage commitment and sustaining OPG production. This study thus unravels previously unidentified roles for p38α MAPK in skeletal development and bone remodeling.

Abstract: Biomechanical insult contributes to many chronic pathological processes, yet the resulting influences on signal transduction mechanisms are poorly understood. The retina presents an excellent mechanotransduction model, as mechanical strain on sensitive astrocytes of the optic nerve head (ONH) is intimately linked to chronic tissue remodeling and excavation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and apoptotic cell death. However, the mechanism by which these effects are induced by biomechanical strain is unclear. We previously identified the small adapter protein, PEA-15 (phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes), through proteomic analyses of human ONH astrocytes subjected to pathologically relevant biomechanical insult. Under resting conditions PEA-15 is regulated through phosphorylation of two key serine residues to inhibit extrinsic apoptosis and ERK1/2 signaling. However, we surprisingly observed that biomechanical insult dramatically switches PEA-15 phosphorylation and function to uncouple its anti-apoptotic activity, and promote ERK1/2-dependent MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion. These results reveal a novel cell autonomous mechanism by which biomechanical strain rapidly modifies this signaling pathway to generate altered tissue injury responses.

Abstract: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest family of cell surface receptors, are involved in many physiological processes. They represent highly important therapeutic targets for drug discovery. Currently, there are numerous cell-based assays developed for the pharmacological profiling of GPCRs and the identification of novel agonists and antagonists. However, the development of new, faster, easier, and more cost-effective approaches to detect GPCR activity remains highly desirable. β-arrestin-dependent internalization has been demonstrated to be a common mechanism for most GPCRs. Here we describe a novel assay for quantitative analysis of GPCR internalization based on DnaE intein-mediated reconstitution of fragmented Renilla luciferase or Firefly luciferase when activated GPCRs interact with β-arrestin2 or Rab5. Further validation, using functionally divergent GPCRs, showed that EC50 values obtained for the known agonists and antagonists were in close agreement with the results of previous reports. This suggests that this assay is sensitive enough to permit quantification of GPCR internalization. Compared with conventional assays, this novel assay system is cost-effective, rapid, and easy to manipulate. These advantages may allow this assay to be used universally as a functional cell-based system for GPCR characterization and in the screening process of drug discovery.

Abstract: Several populations with stem cell characteristics have been identified in the mouse hair follicle, and some are characterized by specific subsets of surface markers. Here we investigate to what extend a multicolor panel of the four surface markers CD34, Sca-1, Integrin-α6 and Plet-1 is sufficient for separating previously described populations. We used global transcriptome profiling to characterize these, and we also performed transcriptome analysis of selected populations after two weeks of culturing. This has not been done before in a context of multiple populations. We identified eight populations of which two have not been described previously: A subset expressing integrin-α6 only and a subset expressing all markers but CD34. Both subsets are highly clonogenic. Transcriptome profiling also showed expression of Hspa2 in a population negative to all markers and immunostaining identified this population as inner root sheath keratinocytes. All cultured populations lost characteristics from the parent population and could not be separated based on the gene expression profile. Our data shows that flow cytometry using multicolor panels can identify further subsets of cells within the epidermis and also highlights a marked discrepancy in gene expression between directly isolated cells and tissue cultured cells.

Abstract: Septins are highly conserved cytoskeletal proteins involved in a variety of biological processes such as cell polarization and cytokinesis. In humans, functional defects in these proteins have been linked to cancer and neuronal diseases. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in studying the structure of septin subunits and the formation of defined heteromeric building blocks. These are assembled into higher-order structures at distinct subcellular sites. An important microscopic approach in studying septin assembly and dynamics is the use of septins tagged with fluorescent proteins. This revealed, eg, that septins form rings during cytokinesis and that septins build extended filaments partially colocalizing with actin cables and microtubules. Here, we describe extensive live cell imaging of septins in the model microorganism Ustilago maydis. We present techniques to study dynamic localization of protein and septin mRNA on shuttling endosomes as well as colocalization of proteins at these highly motile units. Moreover, FLIM-FRET experiments for analyzing local protein interactions are presented. Importantly, these imaging approaches transfer well to other fungal and animal model systems for in vivo analysis of septin dynamics.

Pleiotropic effects of antitumour alkylphospholipids on cholesterol transport and metabolism,

Abstract: Background
Alkylphospholipid (APL) analogs are a new class of membrane-directed synthetic compounds with a variety of biological actions and clinical applications. In particular, these agents are promising candidates in cancer treatment. We have demonstrated that after prolonged treatment APLs alter intracellular cholesterol traffic and metabolism in human tumor-cell lines, leading to an accumulation of cholesterol inside the cell. After further investigation concerning the mode of action of APLs, we have explored the influence of several APLs on novel aspects of cholesterol and lipoprotein homeostasis using hepatoma HepG2 cells and THP1-derived macrophages.
Methods
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis with a pathway-focused PCR array system was performed to measure relative changes in the mRNA expression of a number of genes related to cholesterol transport and metabolism. We compared the gene-expression profiles of HepG2 cells treated with miltefosine, edelfosine or perifosine for 6h and 24h with the profile of control cells. We also analysed particular genes of interest in both HepG2 and macrophage-like THP1 cells using specific PCR assays. Immunoblots were used to confirm protein-expression changes. Measurement of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux was determined using apoA1 as cholesterol acceptor.
Results
We found global changes in gene-expression patterns to maintain cholesterol homeostasis after exposure of cells to APLs. The pathways for cholesterol biosynthesis and LDL-cholesterol uptake were both transcriptionally upregulated by the three APLs assayed. Conversely, major pathways involved in the catabolism of cholesterol to bile acids and lipoprotein-associated cholesterol export were impaired after APL incubation, which may well contribute to the higher cell-cholesterol levels induced by these compounds.
Conclusion
Incubation of cells with different APLs stimulated cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake at the same time as it depressed common pathways for excess cholesterol removal in tumor cells, ultimately leading to altered cholesterol homeostasis.

Abstract: Biallelic mutations in ATM result in the neurodegenerative syndrome Ataxia-Telangiectasia, while ATM haploinsufficiency increases the risk of cancer and other diseases. Previous studies revealed low reprogramming efficiency from A-T and carrier fibroblasts, a barrier to iPS cell-based modeling and regeneration. Here, we tested the feasibility of employing circulating erythroid cells, a compartment no or minimally affected in A-T, for the generation of A-T and carrier iPS cells. Our results indicate that episomal expression of Yamanaka factors plus BCL-xL in erythroid cells results in highly efficient iPS cell production in feeder-free, xeno-free conditions. Moreover, A-T iPS cells generated with this protocol maintain long-term replicative potential, stable karyotypes, re-elongated telomeres and capability to differentiate along the neural lineage in vitro and to form teratomas in vivo. Finally, we find that haploinsufficiency for ATM does not limit reprogramming from human erythroid cells or in vivo teratoma formation in the mouse.

Abstract: Summary
There are currently no disease-modifying therapies for the neurodegenerative disorder Huntington's disease (HD). This study identified novel thiazole-containing inhibitors of the deacetylase sirtuin-2 (SIRT2) with neuroprotective activity in ex vivo brain slice and Drosophila models of HD. A systems biology approach revealed an additional SIRT2-independent property of the lead-compound, MIND4, as an inducer of cytoprotective NRF2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-derived factor 2) activity. Structure-activity relationship studies further identified a potent NRF2 activator (MIND4-17) lacking SIRT2 inhibitory activity. MIND compounds induced NRF2 activation responses in neuronal and non-neuronal cells and reduced production of reactive oxygen species and nitrogen intermediates. These drug-like thiazole-containing compounds represent an exciting opportunity for development of multi-targeted agents with potentially synergistic therapeutic benefits in HD and related disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of mosquito-borne RNA viruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV), is facilitated by genetically complex virus populations within hosts. Here, we determine whether WNV enzootic (Culex tarsalis, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Cx. pipiens) and bridge vectors (Aedes aegypti) have differential impacts on viral mutational diversity and fitness. During systemic mosquito infection, WNV faced stochastic reductions in genetic diversity that rapidly was recovered during intra-tissue population expansions. Interestingly, this intrahost selection and diversification was mosquito species dependent with Cx. tarsalis and Cx. quinquefasciatus exhibiting greater WNV divergence. However, recovered viral populations contained a preponderance of potentially deleterious mutations (i.e., high mutational load) and had lower relative fitness in avian cells compared to input virus. These findings demonstrate that the adaptive potential associated with mosquito transmission varies depending on the mosquito species and carries a significant fitness cost in vertebrates.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs which targets most protein-coding transcripts (mRNA) and destroy them. Thus miRNA controls the abundance of those specific proteins and impact on developmental, physiological and pathological processes. Dysregulation of miRNA function thus may lead to various clinicopathological complications, including breast cancer. Silencing of miR-152 gene due to promoter DNA methylation alter the expression pattern of several other genes. E-cadherin (CDH1) forms the core of adherent junctions between surrounding epithelial cells, link with actin cytoskeleton and affects cell signaling. CDH1 gene is down regulated by promoter DNA methylation during cancer progression. In this investigation, we attempt to elucidate the correlation of miR-152 and CDH1 function, as it is well known that the loss of CDH1 function is one of the major reasons for cancer metastasis and aggressiveness of spreading. For the first time we have shown that loss of CDH1 expression is directly proportional to the loss of miR-152 function in breast cancer cells. mRNA and protein expression profile of DNMT1 implicate that miR-152 targets DNMT1 mRNA and inhibits its protein expression. Tracing the molecular marks on DNA and histone 3 for understanding the mechanism of gene regulation by ChIP analyses leads to a paradoxical result that shows DNA methylation adjacent to active histone marking (enrichment of H3K4me3) silence miR-152 gene. Further experiments revealed that DNMT1 plays crucial role for regulation of miR-152 gene. When DNMT1 protein function is blocked miR-152 expression prevails and destroys the mRNA of DNMT1; this molecular regulatory mechanism is creating a cyclic feedback loop, which is now focused as DNMT1/miR-152 switch for on/off of DNMT1 target genes. We discovered modulation of CDH1 gene expression by DNMT1/miR-152 switches. We have demonstrated further that DNMT1 down regulation mediated upregulation of CDH1 (hereafter, DNMT1/CDH1 loop) in presence of ectopic-excess of miR-152 prevents migration of cancer cells. Our data provides novel insights into the regulation mechanism of miRNA and mRNA/protein coding genes and enhances the amplitude of cancer epigenome.

Abstract: The imprinted genes of primate embryonic stem cells (ESCs) often show altered DNA methylation. It is unknown whether these alterations emerge while deriving the ESCs. Here we studied the methylation patterns of two differentially methylated regions (DMRs), SNRPN and H19/IGF2 DMRs, during the derivation of monkey ESCs. We show that the SNRPN DMR is characteristically methylated at maternal alleles, whereas the H19/IGF2 DMR is globally highly methylated, with unusual methylation on the maternal alleles. These methylation patterns remain stable from the early stages of ESC derivation to late passages of monkey ESCs and following differentiation. Importantly, the methylation status of H19/IGF2 DMR and the expression levels of IGF2, H19, and DNMT3B mRNAs in early embryo-derived cells were correlated with their capacity to generate genuine ESC lines. Thus, we propose that these markers could be useful to predict the outcomes of establishing an ESC line in primates.

Abstract: Summary
The meibomian and sebaceous glands secrete lipids to prevent desiccation of the ocular surface and skin, respectively. Precisely how these holocrine tissues regenerate is not well understood. To address this, we characterized keratin 5+ (K5) label-retaining cells (LRCs) and the lineage tracing of keratin 14 (K14) progenitors in mouse meibomian glands. Using the tet-off H2B-GFP/K5tTA mouse, H2B-GFP fluorescence dilutes 2-fold with every division in K5+ cell nuclei after doxycycline administration. In 3D reconstructions generated over a >28-day doxycycline chase, we observed LRCs at the acinus entrance where K6+ ductal epithelium terminates. For lineage tracing, K14CreERT2-Confetti mice were injected intraperitoneally with tamoxifen and euthanized at 23 and 59 weeks later. Meibomian gland acini in these mice were either monochromatic or dual-colored, whereas the duct exhibited multiple colors. In conclusion, LRCs are likely to direct meibomian gland turnover and may exist as two distinct unipotent progenitors that renew ductal and acinar tissue separately.

Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) markedly induces cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we examined the role of the Ca2+ signaling in the NO-induced CM differentiation of mouse ES cells. We found that NO induced intracellular Ca2+ increases in ES cells in a dose-dependent manner, and application of IP3 pathway antagonists not only significantly inhibited this induced Ca2+ increase but also abolished NO-induced CM differentiation of ES cells. Subsequently, all 3 types of inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) in mouse ES cells were individually or triply knocked down. Interestingly, only knockdown of type 3 IP3R (IP3R3) or triple-knockdown of three types of IP3Rs significantly inhibited the NO-induced Ca2+ increases. Consistently, IP3R3 knockdown blocked the NO-induced CM differentiation of ES cells. CMs derived from IP3R3 knockdown ES cells also showed both structural and functional defects. In summary, our results indicate that the IP3R3-Ca2+ pathway is required for NO-induced CM differentiation of ES cells.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal transgene regulation by transgenic DNA recombinases is a central tool for reverse genetics in multicellular organisms, with excellent applications for misexpression and lineage tracing experiments. One of the most widespread technologies for this purpose is Cre recombinase-controlled lox site recombination that is attracting increasing interest in the zebrafish field. Tol2-mediated zebrafish transgenesis provides a stable platform to integrate lox cassette transgenes, while the amenability of the zebrafish embryo to drug treatments makes the model an ideal candidate for tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 experiments. In addition, advanced transgenesis technologies such as phiC31 or CRISPR-Cas9-based knock-ins are even further promoting zebrafish transgenesis for Cre/lox applications. In this chapter, we will first introduce the basics of Cre/lox methodology, CreERT2 regulation by tamoxifen, as well as the utility of Tol2 and other contemporary transgenesis techniques for Cre/lox experiments. We will then outline in detail practical experimental steps for efficient transgenesis toward the creation of single-insertion transgenes and will introduce protocols for 4-hydroxytamoxifen-mediated CreERT2 induction to perform spatiotemporal lox transgene regulation experiments in zebrafish embryos. Last, we will discuss advanced experimental applications of Cre/lox beyond traditional lineage tracing approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic cells emerge from hemogenic endothelium in the developing embryo. Mechanisms behind human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell development remain unclear. Using a human pluripotent stem cell differentiation model, we report that cyclic AMP (cAMP) induction dramatically increases HSC-like cell frequencies. We show that hematopoietic cell generation requires cAMP signaling through the Exchange proteins activated by cAMP (cAMP-Epac) axis; Epac signaling inhibition decreased both hemogenic and non-hemogenic endothelium, and abrogated hematopoietic cell generation. Furthermore, in hematopoietic progenitor and stem-like cells, cAMP induction mitigated oxidative stress, created a redox-state balance, and enhanced C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) expression, benefiting the maintenance of these primitive cells. Collectively, our study provides insights and mechanistic details on the previously unrecognized role of cAMP signaling in regulating human hematopoietic development. These findings advance the mechanistic understanding of hematopoietic development toward the development of transplantable human hematopoietic cells for therapeutic needs.

Abstract: The microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton plays an active role during different phases of neuronal development and is an essential structure for stable neuronal morphology. MTs determine axon formation, control polarized cargo trafficking, and regulate the dynamics of dendritic spines, the major sites of excitatory synaptic input. Defects in MT function have been linked to various neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and recent studies highlight neuronal MTs as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Thus, understanding MT dynamics and its regulation is of central importance to study many aspects of neuronal function. The dynamics of MT in neurons can be studied by visualizing fluorescently tagged MT plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs). Tracking of +TIP trajectories allows analyzing the speeds and directionality of MT growth in axons and dendrites. Numerous labs now use +TIP to track growing MTs in dissociated neuron cultures. This chapter provides detailed methods for live imaging of MT dynamics in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. We describe protocols for culturing and transducing organotypic slices and imaging MT dynamics by spinning disk confocal microscopy.

Abstract: Summary
While Cas9 nucleases permit rapid and efficient generation of gene-edited cell lines, the CRISPR-Cas9 system can introduce undesirable “on-target” mutations within the second allele of successfully modified cells via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). To address this, we fused the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) nuclease to a peptide derived from the human Geminin protein (SpCas9-Gem) to facilitate its degradation during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, when DNA repair by NHEJ predominates. We also use mRNA transfection to facilitate low and transient expression of modified and unmodified versions of Cas9. Although the frequency of homologous recombination was similar for SpCas9-Gem and SpCas9, we observed a marked reduction in the capacity for SpCas9-Gem to induce NHEJ-mediated indels at the target locus. Moreover, in contrast to native SpCas9, we demonstrate that transient SpCas9-Gem expression enables reliable generation of both knockin reporter cell lines and genetically repaired patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell lines free of unwanted mutations at the targeted locus.

Abstract: Summary
The development of antibodies against specific glycan epitopes poses a significant challenge due to difficulties obtaining desired glycans at sufficient quantity and purity, and the fact that glycans are usually weakly immunogenic. To address this challenge, we leveraged the potent immunostimulatory activity of bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to deliver designer glycan epitopes to the immune system. This approach involved heterologous expression of two clinically important glycans, namely polysialic acid (PSA) and Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T antigen) in hypervesiculating strains of non-pathogenic Escherichia coli. The resulting glycOMVs displayed structural mimics of PSA or T antigen on their surfaces, and induced high titers of glycan-specific IgG antibodies following immunization in mice. In the case of PSA glycOMVs, serum antibodies potently killed Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MenB), whose outer capsule is PSA, in a serum bactericidal assay. These findings demonstrate the potential of glycOMVs for inducing class-switched, humoral immune responses against glycan antigens.

Abstract: Human small heat shock protein HspB6 (Hsp20) was modified by metabolic α-dicarbonyl compound methylglyoxal (MGO). At low MGO/HspB6 molar ratio, Arg13, Arg14, Arg27, and Arg102 were the primary sites of MGO modification. At high MGO/HspB6 ratio, practically, all Arg and Lys residues of HspB6 were modified. Both mild and extensive MGO modification decreased susceptibility of HspB6 to trypsinolysis and prevented its heat-induced aggregation. Modification by MGO was accompanied by formation of small quantities of chemically crosslinked dimers and did not dramatically affect quaternary structure of HspB6. Mild modification by MGO did not affect whereas extensive modification decreased interaction of HspB6 with HspB1. Phosphorylation of HspB6 by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase was inhibited after mild modification and completely prevented after extensive modification by MGO. Chaperone-like activity of HspB6 measured with subfragment 1 of skeletal myosin was enhanced after MGO modifications. It is concluded that Arg residues located in the N-terminal domain of HspB6 are easily accessible to MGO modification and that even mild modification by MGO affects susceptibility to trypsinolysis, phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and chaperone-like activity of HspB6.

Abstract: The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase with critical implications in cell proliferation, migration, wound healing and the regulation of apoptosis. However, the EGFR has been shown to be hyper-expressed in a number of human malignancies. The MDA-MB-468 metastatic breast cell line is one example of this. This particular cell line hyper-expresses the EGFR and undergoes EGFR-mediated apoptosis in response to EGF ligand. The goal of this study was to identify the kinases that could be potential intermediates for the EGFR-mediated induction of apoptosis intracellularly. After identifying Cyclic GMP-dependent Protein Kinase G (PKG) as a plausible intermediate, we wanted to determine the temporal relationship of these two proteins in the induction of apoptosis. We observed a dose-dependent decrease in MDA-MB-468 cell viability, which was co-incident with increased PKG activity as measured by VASPSer239 phosphorylation. In addition, we observed a dose dependent decrease in cell viability, as well as an increase in apoptosis, in response to two different PKG agonists, 8-Bromo-cGMP and 8-pCPT-cGMP. MDA-MB-468 cells with reduced PKG activity had attenuated EGFR-mediated apoptosis. These findings indicate that PKG does not induce cell death via transphosphorylation of the EGFR. Instead, PKG activity occurs following EGFR activation. Together, these data indicate PKG as an intermediary in EGFR-mediated cell death, likely via apoptotic pathway.

Abstract: Primary cilia are cellular antennae that receive and transduce extracellular cues. These microtubule-rich structures are comprised of at least three distinct ciliary compartments: basal bodies, transition zone, and axoneme. Septins have been implicated in cilia function at the transition zone, but accumulating evidence suggests that they localize predominantly within the axoneme. Here, we describe three fixation conditions that preserve the substructure of primary cilia and demonstrate known ciliary proteins that localize to these distinct ciliary substructures. Finally, we show immunostaining and live microscopy methods to detect septins within the axoneme.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is an essential mediator of host defense against intracellular pathogens, including the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. However, prior T. gondii infection blocks IFN-γ-dependent gene transcription, despite the downstream transcriptional activator STAT1 being activated and bound to cognate nuclear promoters. We identify the parasite effector that blocks STAT1-dependent transcription and show it is associated with recruitment of the Mi-2 nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, a chromatin-modifying repressor. This secreted effector, toxoplasma inhibitor of STAT1-dependent transcription (TgIST), translocates to the host cell nucleus, where it recruits Mi-2/NuRD to STAT1-dependent promoters, resulting in altered chromatin and blocked transcription. TgIST is conserved across strains, underlying their shared ability to block IFN-γ-dependent transcription. TgIST deletion results in increased parasite clearance in IFN-γ-activated cells and reduced mouse virulence, which is restored in IFN-γ-receptor-deficient mice. These findings demonstrate the importance of both IFN-γ responses and the ability of pathogens to counteract these defenses.

Abstract: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of gram-negative pathogens expressed in the heart, is activated by several endogenous ligands associated with tissue injury in response to myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of TLR4 signaling in cardiomyocytes dysfunction following hypoxia (90min) using multiple methodologies such as knocking down TLR4 and small interfering RNA (siTLR4). Cardiomyocytes of C57Bl/6 mice (WT) subjected to hypoxic stress showed increased cardiac release of LDH, HMGB1, IκB, TNF-α and myocardial apoptotic and necrotic markers (BAX, PI) compared to TLR4 knock out mice (TLR4KO). Treating these cardiomyocytes with siRNA against TLR4 decreased the damage markers (LDH, IκB, TNF-α). TLR4 silencing during hypoxic stress resulted in the activation of the p-AKT and p-GSK3β (by ∼25%). The latter is an indicator that there is a reduction of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening following hypoxic myocardial induced injury leading to preserved mitochondrial membrane potential. Silencing TLR4 in cardiomyocytes improved cell survival following hypoxic injury through activation of the AKT/GSK3β pathway, reduced inflammatory and apoptotic signals. These findings suggest that TLR4 may serve as a potential target in the treatment of ischemic myocardial injury. Moreover, RNA interfering targeting TLR4 expression represents a therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Analyzing contractile force, the most important and best understood function of cardiomyocytes in vivo is not established in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM). This study describes the generation of 3D, strip-format, force-generating engineered heart tissues (EHT) from hiPSC-CM and their physiological and pharmacological properties. CM were differentiated from hiPSC by a growth factor-based three-stage protocol. EHTs were generated and analyzed histologically and functionally. HiPSC-CM in EHTs showed well-developed sarcomeric organization and alignment, and frequent mitochondria. Systematic contractility analysis (26 concentration-response curves) reveals that EHTs replicated canonical response to physiological and pharmacological regulators of inotropy, membrane- and calcium-clock mediators of pacemaking, modulators of ion-channel currents, and proarrhythmic compounds with unprecedented precision. The analysis demonstrates a high degree of similarity between hiPSC-CM in EHT format and native human heart tissue, indicating that human EHTs are useful for preclinical drug testing and disease modeling.

GRP75 upregulates clathrin-independent endocytosis through actin cytoskeleton reorganization mediated by the concurrent activation of Cdc42 and RhoA,

Abstract: Therapeutic macromolecules are internalized into the cell by either clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) or clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE). Although some chaperone proteins play an essential role in CME (e.g. Hsc70 in clathrin uncoating), relatively few of these proteins are functionally involved in CIE. We previously revealed a role for the mitochondrial chaperone protein GRP75 in heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-mediated, membrane raft-associated macromolecule endocytosis. However, the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. In this study, using a mitochondrial signal peptide-directed protein trafficking expression strategy, we demonstrate that wild-type GRP75 expression enhanced the uptakes of HSPG and CIE marker cholera toxin B subunit but impaired the uptake of CME marker transferrin. The endocytosis regulation function of GRP75 is largely mediated by its subcellular location in mitochondria and is essentially determined by its ATPase domain. Interestingly, the mitochondrial expression of GRP75 or its ATPase domain significantly stimulates increases in both RhoA and Cdc42 activation, remarkably induces stress fibers and enhances filopodia formation, which collectively results in the promotion of CIE, but the inhibition of CME. Furthermore, silencing of Cdc42 or RhoA impaired the ability of GRP75 overexpression to increase CIE. Therefore, these results suggest that endocytosis vesicle enrichment of GRP75 by mitochondria trafficking upregulates CIE through an actin cytoskeleton reorganization mechanism mediated by the concurrent activation of Cdc42 and RhoA. This finding provides novel insight into organelle-derived chaperone signaling and the regulation of different endocytosis pathways in cells.

Abstract: Myostatin, also known as growth differentiation factor 8, is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily that has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of the skeletal muscle mass. Indeed, while myostatin deletion or loss of function induces muscle hypertrophy, its overexpression or systemic administration causes muscle atrophy. Since myostatin blockade is effective in increasing skeletal muscle mass, myostatin inhibitors have been actively sought after. Decorin, a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family is a metalloprotein that was previously shown to bind and inactivate myostatin in a zinc-dependent manner. Furthermore, the myostatin-binding site has been shown to be located in the decorin N-terminal domain. In the present study, we investigated the anti-myostatin activity of short and soluble fragments of decorin. Our results indicate that the murine decorin peptides DCN48-71 and 42-65 are sufficient for inactivating myostatin in vitro. Moreover, we show that the interaction of mDCN48-71 to myostatin is strictly zinc-dependent. Binding of myostatin to activin type II receptor results in the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Addition of the decorin peptide 48-71 decreased in a dose-dependent manner the myostatin-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 demonstrating thereby that the peptide inhibits the activation of the Smad signaling pathway. Finally, we found that mDCN48-71 displays a specificity towards myostatin, since it does not inhibit other members of the transforming growth factor-beta family.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is a current global public health concern. The flavivirus envelope (E) glycoprotein is responsible for virus entry and represents a major target of neutralizing antibodies for other flaviviruses. Here, we report the structures of ZIKV E protein at 2.0 Å and in complex with a flavivirus broadly neutralizing murine antibody 2A10G6 at 3.0 Å. ZIKV-E resembles all the known flavivirus E structures but contains a unique, positively charged patch adjacent to the fusion loop region of the juxtaposed monomer, which may influence host attachment. The ZIKV-E-2A10G6 complex structure reveals antibody recognition of a highly conserved fusion loop. 2A10G6 binds to ZIKV-E with high affinity in vitro and neutralizes currently circulating ZIKV strains in vitro and in mice. The E protein fusion loop epitope represents a potential candidate for therapeutic antibodies against ZIKV.

Abstract: Functional studies in Drosophila have been key for establishing a role for the septin family of proteins in animal cell division and thus extending for the first time observations from the budding yeast to animal cells. Visualizing the distribution of specific septins in different Drosophila tissues and, in particular, in the Drosophila embryo, together with biochemical and mutant phenotype data, has contributed important advances to our understanding of animal septin biology, suggesting roles in processes other than in cytokinesis. Septin localization using immunofluorescence assays has been possible due to the generation of antibodies against different Drosophila septins. The recent availability of lines expressing fluorescent protein fusions of specific septins further promises to facilitate studies on septin dynamics. Here, we provide protocols for preparing early Drosophila embryos to visualize septins using immunofluorescence assays and live fluorescence microscopy. The genetic tractability of the Drosophila embryo together with its amenability to high-resolution fluorescence microscopy promises to provide novel insights into animal septin structure and function.

Abstract: Summary
The increasing threats of antibiotic resistance urge the need for developing new strategies against bacterial infections. Targeting eukaryotic-like Ser/Thr phosphatase Stp1-mediated virulence regulation represents a promising approach for combating staphylococcal infection yet to be explored. Here, we report the 2.32-Å resolution crystal structure of Stp1. Stp1 binds an unexpected fourth metal ion, which is important for Stp1's enzymatic activity as demonstrated by amino acid substitution studies. Inspired by the structural details of Stp1, we identified a potent and selective Stp1 inhibitor, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). Transcriptome analysis and biochemical studies supported Stp1 as the target of ATA inhibition within the pathogen, preventing upregulation of virulence genes. Notably, ATA did not affect in vitro growth of Staphylococcus aureus, while simultaneously attenuating staphylococcal virulence in mice. Our findings demonstrate that ATA is a potent anti-virulence compound against staphylococcal infection, laying the foundation for further developing new scaffolds for Stp1-targeted small molecules.

Abstract: The understanding of how biological membranes are organized and how they function has evolved. Instead of just serving as a medium in which certain proteins are found, portions of the lipid bilayer have been demonstrated to form specialized platforms that foster the assembly of signaling complexes by providing a microenvironment that is conducive for effective protein–protein interactions. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and relevant signaling molecules, including the heterotrimeric G proteins, key enzymes such as kinases and phosphatases, trafficking proteins, and secondary messengers, preferentially partition to these highly organized cell membrane microdomains, called lipid rafts. As such, lipid rafts are crucial for the trafficking and signaling of GPCRs. The study of GPCR biology in the context of lipid rafts involves the localization of the GPCR of interest in lipid rafts, at the basal state and upon receptor agonism, and the evaluation of the biological functions of the GPCR in appropriate cell lines. The lack of standardized methodology to study lipid rafts, in general, and of the workings of GPCRs in lipid rafts, in particular, and the inherent drawbacks of current methods have hampered the complete understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Newer methodologies that allow the study of GPCRs in their native form are needed. The use of complementary approaches that produce mutually supportive results appear to be the best way for drawing conclusions with regards to the distribution and activity of GPCRs in lipid rafts.

Abstract: Since their discovery, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute one of the most studied proteins leading to important discoveries and perspectives in terms of their biology and implication in physiology and pathophysiology. This is mostly linked to the remarkable advances in the development and application of the biophysical resonance energy transfer (RET)-based approaches, including bioluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (BRET and FRET, respectively). Indeed, BRET and FRET have been extensively applied to study different aspects of GPCR functioning such as their activation and regulation either statically or dynamically, in real-time and intact cells. Consequently, our view on GPCRs has considerably changed opening new challenges for the study of GPCRs in their native tissues in the aim to get more knowledge on how these receptors control the biological responses. Moreover, the technological aspect of this field of research promises further developments for robust and reliable new RET-based assays that may be compatible with high-throughput screening as well as drug discovery programs.

Abstract: Ectopic expression of lineage-specific transcription factors facilitates the conversion of mammalian somatic cells into dopaminergic (DA) neurons, which is a promising strategy for cell therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, this approach still has some drawbacks limiting its clinical application due to the potential risks of integrating vectors into the host genome. Therefore, it is critical to seek a more desired approach to generate DA neurons derived from mammalian somatic cells. Here, we report that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) can be efficiently converted into DA neurons by using small molecules along with specific growth factors. These neuron-like cells generate DA neuronal morphology, and acquire immunocytochemical and calcium imaging special for neuronal electrophysiological profile. More importantly, these converted cells can secrete dopamine, indicating that they are functionally similar to DA neurons. Taken together, our study might provide a promising cell source for treating PD by using chemical approach without introduction of exogenous transcription factors.

Abstract: Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in progression of pleural malignant mesothelioma. A significantly increased incidence of pleural mesothelioma has been attributed to exposure to fluoro-edenite, a fibrous amphibole extracted from a local stone quarry. In this study, we have investigated the expression of CD68-positive macrophages, tryptase-positive mast cells and CD31 positive areas, as expression of microvascular density, in lung tissue of sheeps exposed to fluoro-edenite fibers vs controls, by immunohistochemical, morphometric and Western blot analysis. The result have evidenced a significant increase in the expression of CD68-positive macrophages, tryptase-positive mast cells as well as a significant increase in microvascular density evaluated as CD31 positive areas in lung tissue of of sheeps exposed to fluoro-edenite fibers vs controls. These data confirmed the important role played by tumor microenvironment components, including macrophages and mast cells, in favour of angiogenesis in pleural mesothelioma induced by fluoro-edenite exposure.

Abstract: C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP3) is an adipokine with modulation effects on metabolism and inflammation. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) exerts multiple biological effects in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and energy imbalance is involved in vascular diseases. This study aimed to explore the effect of CTRP3 on energy production and its underlying mechanism in VSMCs. Our results indicated that exogenous CTRP3 increased ATP synthesis and the protein expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-related molecules, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC)-1α, sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), complex I, II, III, and V in cultured VSMCs. Depletion of endogenous CTRP3 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced ATP synthesis and the expression of those molecules. PGC-1α knockdown abrogated CTRP3-induced ATP production and OXPHOS-related protein expression. Furthermore, CTRP3 increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential level. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a reactive oxygen species scavenger, and cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, an uncoupler of OXPHOS, suppressed CTRP3-induced ROS production, PGC-1α expression and ATP synthesis. In conclusion, CTRP3 modulates mitochondrial energy production through targets of ROS and PGC-1α in VSMCs.

Abstract: Progenitor cells in the adult pancreas are potential sources of endocrine beta cells for treating type 1 diabetes. Previously, we identified tri-potent progenitor cells in the adult (2–4month-old) murine pancreas that were capable of self-renewal and differentiation into duct, acinar, and endocrine cells in vitro. These progenitor cells were named pancreatic colony-forming units (PCFUs). However, because PCFUs are a minor population in the pancreas (~1%) they are difficult to study. To enrich PCFUs, strategies using cell-surface marker analyses and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were developed. We found that CD133highCD71low cells, but not other cell populations, enriched PCFUs by up to 30 fold compared to the unsorted cells. CD133highCD71low cells generated primary, secondary, and subsequent colonies when serially re-plated in Matrigel-containing cultures, suggesting self-renewal abilities. In the presence of a laminin hydrogel, CD133highCD71low cells gave rise to colonies that contained duct, acinar, and Insulin+Glucagon+ double-hormonal endocrine cells. Colonies from the laminin hydrogel culture were implanted into diabetic mice, and five weeks later duct, acinar, and Insulin+Glucagon− cells were detected in the grafts, demonstrating tri-lineage differentiation potential of CD133highCD71low cells. These CD133highCD71low cells will enable future studies of putative adult pancreas stem cells in vivo.

Abstract: We present a simple and efficient method to knock down proteins specifically in Purkinje neurons (PN) present in mixed mouse primary cerebellar cultures. This method utilizes the introduction via nucleofection of a plasmid encoding a specific miRNA downstream of the L7/Pcp2 promoter, which drives PN-specific expression. As proof-of-principle, we used this plasmid to knock down the motor protein myosin Va, which is required for the targeting of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into PN spines. Consistent with effective knockdown, transfected PNs robustly phenocopied PNs from dilute-lethal (myosin Va-null) mice with regard to the ER targeting defect. Importantly, our plasmid-based approach is less challenging technically and more specific to PNs than several alternative methods (e.g., biolistic- and lentiviral-based introduction of siRNAs). We also present a number of improvements for generating mixed cerebellar cultures that shorten the procedure and improve the total yield of PNs, and of transfected PNs, considerably. Finally, we present a method to rescue cerebellar cultures that develop large cell aggregates, a common problem that otherwise precludes the further use of the culture.

Abstract: Summary
To cause disease, a microbial pathogen must adapt to the challenges of its host environment. The leading fungal pathogen Candida albicans colonizes nutrient-poor bodily niches, withstands attack from the immune system, and tolerates treatment with azole antifungals, often evolving resistance. To discover agents that block these adaptive strategies, we screened 300,000 compounds for inhibition of azole tolerance in a drug-resistant Candida isolate. We identified a novel indazole derivative that converts azoles from fungistatic to fungicidal drugs by selective inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome bc1. We synthesized 103 analogs to optimize potency (half maximal inhibitory concentration 0.4 μM) and fungal selectivity (28-fold over human). In addition to reducing azole resistance, targeting cytochrome bc1 prevents C. albicans from adapting to the nutrient-deprived macrophage phagosome and greatly curtails its virulence in mice. Inhibiting mitochondrial respiration and restricting metabolic flexibility with this synthetically tractable chemotype provides an attractive therapeutic strategy to limit both fungal virulence and drug resistance.

Abstract: Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) binds and activates FGF receptors, thereby regulating cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Human FGF1 gene 1B promoter (−540 to +31)-driven SV40 T antigen has been shown to result in tumorigenesis in the brains of transgenic mice. FGF1B promoter (−540 to +31)-driven green fluorescent protein (F1BGFP) has also been used in isolating neural stem cells (NSCs) with self-renewal and multipotency from developing and adult mouse brains. In this study, we provide six lines of evidence to demonstrate that FGF1/FGFR signaling is implicated in the expression of Aurora A (AurA) and the activation of its kinase domain (Thr288 phosphorylation) in the maintenance of glioblastoma (GBM) cells and NSCs. First, treatment of FGF1 increases AurA expression in human GBM cell lines. Second, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we observed that F1BGFP reporter facilitates the isolation of F1BGFP(+) GBM cells with higher expression levels of FGFR and AurA. Third, both FGFR inhibitor (SU5402) and AurA inhibitor (VX680) could down-regulate F1BGFP-dependent AurA activity. Fourth, inhibition of AurA activity by two different AurA inhibitors (VX680 and valproic acid) not only reduced neurosphere formation but also induced neuronal differentiation of F1BGFP(+) GBM cells. Fifth, flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that F1BGFP(+) GBM cells possessed different NSC cell surface markers. Finally, inhibition of AurA by VX680 reduced the neurosphere formation of different types of NSCs. Our results show that activation of AurA kinase through FGF1/FGFR signaling axis sustains the stem cell characteristics of GBM cells.
Implications
This study identified a novel mechanism for the malignancy of GBM, which could be a potential therapeutic target for GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) synthesize a vast variety of small molecules, including antibiotics, antitumors, and immunosuppressants. The NRPS condensation (C) domain catalyzes amide bond formation, the central chemical step in nonribosomal peptide synthesis. The catalytic mechanism and substrate determinants of the reaction are under debate. We developed chemical probes to structurally study the NRPS condensation reaction. These substrate analogs become covalently tethered to a cysteine introduced near the active site, to mimic covalent substrate delivery by carrier domains. They are competent substrates in the condensation reaction and behave similarly to native substrates. Co-crystal structures show C domain-substrate interactions, and suggest that the catalytic histidine's principle role is to position the α-amino group for nucleophilic attack. Structural insight provided by these co-complexes also allowed us to alter the substrate specificity profile of the reaction with a single point mutation.

Abstract: Reversible covalent histone modifications are known to influence spatiotemporal patterns of gene transcription during development. Here I review recent advances in the development and use of methods to analyze the distribution and functions of histone modifications in zebrafish chromatin. I discuss the roles of dynamic histone modification patterns at the promoters and enhancers of genes during the process of zygotic gene activation at blastula stages and the interplay between the molecular machinery responsible for histone modifications, chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation. Interactions are also described between developmentally regulated enhancer sequences and modified histones. A detailed method for chromatin immunoprecipitation using antibodies is provided, and I describe the use of high-throughput whole genome sequencing technology to generate DNA sequence data from chromatin immunoprecipitates. I also discuss computational approaches to integrating DNA sequence data obtained from chromatin immunoprecipitates with annotated reference genome sequences, transcriptome and methylome sequence data, transcription factor binding motif databases, and gene ontologies and describe the types of software tools currently available for visualizing the results.

Abstract: Summary
In animals, Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins are molecular adaptors that regulate innate and adaptive immunity, development, and abiotic stress responses. Although gene families encoding TRAF domain-containing proteins exhibit enriched diversity in higher plants, their biological roles are poorly defined. Here, we report the identification of two redundant TRAF proteins, Mutant, snc1-enhancing 13 (MUSE13) and MUSE14, that contribute to the turnover of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR) immune receptors SNC1 and RPS2. Loss of both MUSE13 and MUSE14 leads to enhanced pathogen resistance, NLR accumulation, and autoimmunity, while MUSE13 overexpression results in reduced NLR levels and activity. In planta, MUSE13 associates with SNC1, RPS2, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFCPR1. Taken together, we speculate that MUSE13 and MUSE14 associate with the SCF E3 ligase complex to form a plant-type TRAFasome, which modulates ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of NLR immune sensors to maintain their homeostasis.

Abstract: The ability of eukaryotes to adapt to an extreme range of temperatures is critically important for survival. Although adaptation to extreme high temperatures is well understood, reflecting the action of molecular chaperones, it is unclear whether these molecules play a role in survival at extremely low temperatures. The recent genome sequencing of the yeast Glaciozyma antarctica, isolated from Antarctic sea ice near Casey Station, provides an opportunity to investigate the role of molecular chaperones in adaptation to cold temperatures. We isolated a G. antarctica homologue of small heat shock protein 20 (HSP20), GaSGT1, and observed that the GaSGT1 mRNA expression in G. antarctica was markedly increased following culture exposure at low temperatures. Additionally, we demonstrated that GaSGT1 overexpression in Escherichia coli protected these bacteria from exposure to both high and low temperatures, which are lethal for growth. The recombinant GaSGT1 retained up to 60 % of its native luciferase activity after exposure to luciferase-denaturing temperatures. These results suggest that GaSGT1 promotes cell thermotolerance and employs molecular chaperone-like activity toward temperature assaults.

Abstract: This study aimed to identify the response of a salivary stress protein, extracellular heat shock protein (eHSP70), to intense exercise and to investigate the relationship between salivary eHSP70 and salivary immunoglobulin A (SIgA) levels in response to exercise. Sixteen healthy sedentary young males (means ± SD 23.8±1.5 years, 172.2±6.4 cm, 68.3±7.4 kg) performed 59 min of cycling exercise at 75 % VO2max. Saliva and whole blood samples were collected before (Pre), immediately after (Post), and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after completion of the exercise (1, 2, 3, and 4 h). The salivary eHSP70 and SIgA levels were measured by enzyme-linked imunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the secretion rates were computed by multiplying the concentration by the saliva flow rate. White blood cells were analyzed using an automated cell counter with a direct-current detection system. The salivary eHSP70 secretion rates were 1.11 ± 0.86, 1.51 ± 1.47, 1.57 ± 1.32, 2.21 ± 2.04, 3.36 ± 2.72, and 6.89±4.02 ng · min−1 at Pre, Post, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 h, respectively. The salivary eHSP70 secretion rate was significantly higher at 4 h than that at Pre, Post, 1, and 3 h (p < 0.05). The SIgA secretion rates were 26.9 ± 12.6, 20.3 ± 10.4, 19.6 ± 11.0, 21.8 ± 12.8, 21.5 ± 11.9, and 21.9±11.7 μg · min−1 at Pre, Post, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h, respectively. The salivary SIgA secretion rate was significantly lower between 1 and 4 h than that at Pre (p < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between salivary eHSP70 and SIgA in both concentration and secretion rates before exercise (p < 0.05). The absolute number of white blood cells significantly increased after exercise, with a maximum at 2 h (p < 0.05). The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased from 1 to 4 h when compared with that in the Pre samples (p < 0.05). The present study revealed that salivary eHSP70 significantly increased at 4 h after the 59 min of intense exercise in sedentary male subjects. Exercise stress can induce elevated salivary eHSP70 level and upregulate oral immune function partially.

Abstract: Summary
Endosomal entrapment is a severely limiting bottleneck in the delivery of biologics into cells. The compound dfTAT was recently found to circumvent this problem by mediating endosomal leakage efficiently and without toxicity. Herein, we report on the mechanism of endosomal escape of this cell-penetrating peptide. By modulating the trafficking of the peptide within the endocytic pathway, we identify late endosomes as the organelles rendered leaky by dfTAT. We establish that dfTAT binds bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid found in late endosomes, and that the peptide causes the fusion and leakage of bilayers containing BMP. Together, these data identify late endosomes as desirable gateways for cell penetration and BMP as a cellular factor that can be exploited for the development of future delivery agents.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are believed to be mediators of excessive microglial activation, yet the resources and mechanism are not fully understood. Here we stimulated murine microglial BV-2 cells and primary microglial cells with different inhibitors of electron transport chain (ETC), rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), antimycin A, and NaN3 to induce mitochondrial ROS production and we observed the role of mitochondrial ROS in microglial activation. Our results showed that ETC inhibitors resulted in significant changes in cell viability, microglial morphology, cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial ROS production in a dose-dependent manner in both primary cultural microglia and BV-2 cell lines. Moreover, ETC inhibitors, especially rotenone and antimycin A stimulated secretion of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) by microglia with marked activation of mitogen-activated proteinkinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which could be blocked by specific inhibitors of MAPK and NF-κB and mitochondrial antioxidants, Mito-TEMPO. Taken together, our results demonstrated that inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain in microglia led to production of mitochondrial ROS and therefore may activate MAPK/NF-кB dependent inflammatory cytokines release in microglia, which indicated that mitochondrial-derived ROS were contributed to microglial activation.

Abstract: Successful stem cell therapy after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is hindered by lack of engraftment of sufficient stem cells at the site of injury. We designed a novel technique to overcome this problem by assembling stem cell-microbubble complexes, named ‘StemBells’. StemBells were assembled through binding of dual-targeted microbubbles (~3μm) to adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) via a CD90 antibody. StemBells were targeted to the infarct area via an ICAM-1 antibody on the microbubbles. StemBells were characterized microscopically and by flow cytometry. The effect of ultrasound on directing StemBells towards the vessel wall was demonstrated in an in vitro flow model. In a rat AMI-reperfusion model, StemBells or ASCs were injected one week post-infarction. A pilot study demonstrated feasibility of intravenous StemBell injection, resulting in localization in ICAM-1-positive infarct area three hours post-injection. In a functional study five weeks after injection of StemBells cardiac function was significantly improved compared with controls, as monitored by 2D-echocardiography. This functional improvement neither coincided with a reduction in infarct size as determined by histochemical analysis, nor with a change in anti- and pro-inflammatory macrophages. In conclusion, the StemBell technique is a novel and feasible method, able to improve cardiac function post-AMI in rats.

Abstract: Acquired tamoxifen (TAM) resistance is a significant clinical problem in treating patients with estrogen receptor α (ERα)+ breast cancer. We reported that ERα increases nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), which regulates nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene transcription, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and NRF-1 knockdown stimulates apoptosis. Whether NRF-1 and target gene expression is altered in endocrine resistant breast cancer cells is unknown. We measured NRF-1and metabolic features in a cell model of progressive TAM-resistance. NRF-1 and its target mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) were higher in TAM-resistant LCC2 and LCC9 cells than TAM-sensitive MCF-7 cells. Using extracellular flux assays we observed that LCC1, LCC2, and LCC9 cells showed similar oxygen consumption rate (OCR), but lower mitochondrial reserve capacity which was correlated with lower Succinate Dehydrogenase Complex, Subunit B in LCC1 and LCC2 cells. Complex III activity was lower in LCC9 than MCF-7 cells. LCC1, LCC2, and LCC9 cells had higher basal extracellular acidification (ECAR), indicating higher aerobic glycolysis, relative to MCF-7 cells. Mitochondrial bioenergetic responses to estradiol and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were reduced in the endocrine-resistant cells compared to MCF-7 cells. These results suggest the acquisition of altered metabolic phenotypes in response to long term antiestrogen treatment may increase vulnerability to metabolic stress.

Abstract: Summary
A widely shared view reads that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (“MSCs”) are ubiquitous in human connective tissues, can be defined by a common in vitro phenotype, share a skeletogenic potential as assessed by in vitro differentiation assays, and coincide with ubiquitous pericytes. Using stringent in vivo differentiation assays and transcriptome analysis, we show that human cell populations from different anatomical sources, regarded as “MSCs” based on these criteria and assumptions, actually differ widely in their transcriptomic signature and in vivo differentiation potential. In contrast, they share the capacity to guide the assembly of functional microvessels in vivo, regardless of their anatomical source, or in situ identity as perivascular or circulating cells. This analysis reveals that muscle pericytes, which are not spontaneously osteochondrogenic as previously claimed, may indeed coincide with an ectopic perivascular subset of committed myogenic cells similar to satellite cells. Cord blood-derived stromal cells, on the other hand, display the unique capacity to form cartilage in vivo spontaneously, in addition to an assayable osteogenic capacity. These data suggest the need to revise current misconceptions on the origin and function of so-called “MSCs,” with important applicative implications. The data also support the view that rather than a uniform class of “MSCs,” different mesoderm derivatives include distinct classes of tissue-specific committed progenitors, possibly of different developmental origin.

Abstract: Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell and are an essential component of the innate immune system. A complete cataloguing of cell surface markers has not been undertaken for neutrophils isolated from circulation as well as healthy and inflamed tissues. To identify cell-surface markers specific to human neutrophils, we used high-throughput flow cytometry to screen neutrophil populations isolated from blood and oral rinses from healthy and chronic periodontitis patients against a panel of 374 known cluster of differentiation (CD) antibodies. This screen identified CD11b, CD16, and CD66b as markers that are consistently expressed on neutrophils independent of the cell location, level of activation and disease state. Cell sorting against CD11b, CD16 and CD66b allowed for the enrichment of mature neutrophils, yielding neutrophil populations with up to 99% purity. These findings suggest an ideal surface marker set for isolating mature neutrophils from humans. The screen also demonstrated that tissue neutrophils from chronically inflamed tissue display a unique surface marker set compared to tissue neutrophils present in healthy, non-inflamed tissues.

Abstract: Summary
We previously reported the generation of integration-free induced pluripotent stem cells from adult peripheral blood (PB) with an improved episomal vector (EV) system, which uses the spleen focus-forming virus U3 promoter and an extra factor BCL-XL (B). Here we show an ∼100-fold increase in efficiency by optimizing the vector combination. The two most critical factors are: (1) equimolar expression of OCT4 (O) and SOX2 (S), by using a 2A linker; (2) a higher and gradual increase in the MYC (M) to KLF4 (K) ratio during the course of reprogramming, by using two individual vectors to express M and K instead of one. The combination of EV plasmids (OS + M + K + B) is comparable with Sendai virus in reprogramming efficiency but at a fraction of the cost. The generated iPSCs are indistinguishable from those from our previous approach in pluripotency and phenotype. This improvement lays the foundation for broad applications of episomal vectors in PB reprogramming.

Abstract: Myogenesis is required for the development of skeletal muscle. Accumulating evidence indicates that the expression of several genes are upregulated during myogenesis and these genes play pivotal roles in myogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying myogenesis is not fully understood. In this study, we found that β-taxilin, which is specifically expressed in the skeletal muscle and heart tissues, was progressively expressed during differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes, prompting us to investigate the role of β-taxilin in myogenesis. In C2C12 cells, knockdown of β-taxilin impaired the fusion of myoblasts into myotubes, and decreased the diameter of myotubes. We also found that β-taxilin interacted with dysbindin, a coiled-coil-containing protein. Knockdown of dysbindin conversely promoted the fusion of myoblasts into myotubes and increased the diameter of myotubes in C2C12 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of dysbindin attenuated the inhibitory effect of β-taxilin depletion on myotube formation of C2C12 cells. These results demonstrate that β-taxilin participates in myogenesis through suppressing the function of dysbindin to inhibit the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes.

Abstract: The oligomeric molecular chaperone CCT is essential for the folding of the highly abundant protein actin, which in its native state forms actin filaments that generate the traction forces required for cell motility. In addition to folding proteins, CCT can provide a platform for protein complex assembly and binds actin filaments assembled in vitro. Some individual subunits of CCT, when monomeric, have been shown to be functionally active, and in particular, the CCTepsilon subunit is involved in the serum response factor pathway that controls actin transcription. Thus, there is a complex interplay between CCT and actin that extends beyond actin folding. CCT has recently been shown to bind gelsolin, an actin filament severing protein that increases actin dynamics by generating filament ends for further actin polymerization. However, the biological significance of the CCT:gelsolin interaction is unknown. Here, using a co-immunoprecipitation assay, we show that CCT binds directly to gelsolin in its calcium-activated, actin-severing conformation. Furthermore, using actin filaments retained from fixed and permeabilized cells, we demonstrate that CCT can inhibit the actin filament severing activity of gelsolin. As our work and that of others shows gelsolin is not folded by CCT, the CCT:gelsolin interaction represents a novel mode of binding where CCT may modulate protein activity. The data presented here reveal an additional level of interplay between CCT and actin mediated via gelsolin, suggesting that CCT may influence processes depending on gelsolin activity, such as cell motility.

Abstract: Summary
In human-to-mouse xenograft models, reconstitution of human hematopoiesis is usually B-lymphoid dominant. Here we show that the introduction of homozygous KitWv mutations into C57BL/6.Rag2nullIl2rgnull mice with NOD-Sirpa (BRGS) strongly promoted human multi-lineage reconstitution. After xenotransplantation of human CD34+CD38− cord blood cells, these newly generated C57BL/6.Rag2nullIl2rgnullNOD-Sirpa KitWv/Wv (BRGSKWv/Wv) mice showed significantly higher levels of human cell chimerism and long-term multi-lineage reconstitution compared with BRGS mice. Strikingly, this mouse displayed a robust reconstitution of human erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis with terminal maturation in the bone marrow. Furthermore, depletion of host macrophages by clodronate administration resulted in the presence of human erythrocytes and platelets in the circulation. Thus, attenuation of mouse KIT signaling greatly enhances the multi-lineage differentiation of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in mouse bone marrow, presumably by outcompeting mouse HSPCs to occupy suitable microenvironments. The BRGSKWv/Wv mouse model is a useful tool to study human multi-lineage hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Zebrafish embryonic cell cultures have many useful properties that make them complementary to intact embryos for a wide range of studies. Embryonic cell cultures allow for maintenance of transient cell populations, control of chemical and mechanical cues received by cells, and facile chemical screening. Zebrafish cells can be cultured in either heterogeneous or homogeneous cultures from a wide range of developmental time points. Here we describe two methods with particular applicability to chemical screening: a method for the culture of blastomeres for directed differentiation toward the myogenic lineage and a method for the culture of neural crest cells in heterogeneous cultures from early somitogenesis embryos.

Abstract: The β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) is a prototypical member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily of proteins and is one of the best-characterized GPCRs due to its role in several important physiological systems. Because of limited availability of high quality antibodies against GPCRs, much of the work done on β2AR took advantage of heterologous expression systems. Overexpressed proteins may overwhelm the cellular regulatory machinery leading potentially to responses distinct from the native protein. To address this issue we generated a stable cell line with a tetracycline-inducible β2AR tagged with a FLAG epitope, such that we are able to control the quantity of receptor produced. This allows us to induce a discrete pulse of FLAG-β2AR transcription and translation allowing us to follow the complete life cycle of the protein from synthesis as an immature protein to degradation. We show that such limited pulses of receptor expression lead to signaling phenotypes that more closely reflect endogenous signaling events.

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are capable of unlimited self-renewal and can generate nearly all cells in the body. Changes induced by different LSD1 activities on the regulation of hiPSC self-renewal and differentiation and the mechanism underlying such changes were determined. We used two different LSD1 inhibitors (phenelzine sulfate and tranylcypromine) and RNAi technique to inhibit LSD1 activity, and we obtained hiPSCs showing 71.3%, 53.28%, and 31.33% of the LSD1 activity in normal hiPSCs. The cells still maintained satisfactory self-renewal capacity when LSD1 activity was at 71.3%. The growth rate of hiPSCs decreased and cells differentiated when LSD1 activity was at approximately 53.28%. The hiPSCs were mainly arrested in the G0/G1 phase and simultaneously differentiated into endodermal tissue when LSD1 activity was at 31.33%. Teratoma experiments showed that the downregulation of LSD1 resulted in low teratoma volume. When LSD1 activity was below 50%, pluripotency of hiPSCs was impaired, and the teratomas mainly comprised endodermal and mesodermal tissues. This phenomenon was achieved by regulating the critical balance between histone methylation and demethylation at regulatory regions of several key pluripotent and developmental genes.

Abstract: The scaffold protein alpha-syntrophin (SNTA) regulates lipolysis indicating a role in lipid homeostasis. Adipocytes are the main lipid storage cells in the body, and here, the function of SNTA has been analyzed in 3T3-L1 cells. SNTA is expressed in preadipocytes and is induced early during adipogenesis. Knock-down of SNTA in preadipocytes increases their proliferation. Proteins which are induced during adipogenesis like adiponectin and caveolin-1, and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 are at normal levels in the mature cells differentiated from preadipocytes with low SNTA. This suggests that SNTA does neither affect differentiation nor inflammation. Expression of proteins with a role in cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis is unchanged. Consequently, basal and epinephrine induced lipolysis as well as insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 are normal. Importantly, adipocytes with low SNTA form smaller lipid droplets and store less triglycerides. Stearoyl-CoA reductase and MnSOD are reduced upon SNTA knock-down but do not contribute to lower lipid levels. Oleate uptake is even increased in cells with SNTA knock-down. In summary, current data show that SNTA is involved in the expansion of lipid droplets independent of adipogenesis. Enhanced preadipocyte proliferation and capacity to store surplus fatty acids may protect adipocytes with low SNTA from lipotoxicity in obesity.

Abstract: Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is the catalytic and limiting component of telomerase and also a transcription factor. It is critical to the integrity of the ends of linear chromosomes and to the regulation, extent and rate of cell cycle progression in multicellular eukaryotes. The level of hTERT expression is essential to a wide range of bodily functions and to avoidance of disease conditions, such as cancer, that are mediated in part by aberrant level and regulation of cell cycle proliferation. Value of a gene in regulation depends on its ability to both receive input from multiple sources and transmit signals to multiple effectors. The expression of hTERT and the progression of the cell cycle have been shown to be regulated by an extensive network of gene products and signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and TGF-β pathways. The PI3K inhibitor PX-866 and the competitive estrogen receptor ligand raloxifene have been shown to modify progression of those pathways and, in combination, to decrease proliferation of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We found that combinations of modulators of those pathways decreased not only hTERT transcription but also transcription of additional essential cell cycle regulators such as Cyclin D1. By evaluating known expression profile signatures for TGF-β pathway diversions, we confirmed additional genes such as heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB EGF) by which those pathways and their perturbations may also modify cell cycle progression.
