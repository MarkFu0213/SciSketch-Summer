Abstract: Summary
The enhancer landscape of pluripotent stem cells undergoes extensive reorganization during early mammalian development. The functions and mechanisms behind such reorganization, however, are unclear. Here, we show that the transcription factor GRHL2 is necessary and sufficient to activate an epithelial subset of enhancers as naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) transition into formative epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). Surprisingly, many GRHL2 target genes do not change in expression during the ESC-EpiLC transition. Instead, enhancers regulating these genes in ESCs diminish in activity in EpiLCs while GRHL2-dependent alternative enhancers become activated to maintain transcription. GRHL2 therefore assumes control over a subset of the naive network via enhancer switching to maintain expression of epithelial genes upon exit from naive pluripotency. These data evoke a model where the naive pluripotency network becomes partitioned into smaller, independent networks regulated by EpiLC-specific transcription factors, thereby priming cells for lineage specification.

Abstract: Summary
Despite widespread interest in using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in neurological disease modeling, a suitable model system to study human neuronal connectivity is lacking. Here, we report a comprehensive and efficient differentiation paradigm for hiPSCs that generate multiple CA3 pyramidal neuron subtypes as detected by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). This differentiation paradigm exhibits characteristics of neuronal network maturation, and rabies virus tracing revealed synaptic connections between stem cell-derived dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 neurons in vitro recapitulating the neuronal connectivity within the hippocampus. Because hippocampal dysfunction has been implicated in schizophrenia, we applied DG and CA3 differentiation paradigms to schizophrenia-patient-derived hiPSCs. We detected reduced activity in DG-CA3 co-culture and deficits in spontaneous and evoked activity in CA3 neurons from schizophrenia-patient-derived hiPSCs. Our approach offers critical insights into the network activity aspects of schizophrenia and may serve as a promising tool for modeling diseases with hippocampal vulnerability.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic changes causing brain size expansion in human evolution have remained elusive. Notch signaling is essential for radial glia stem cell proliferation and is a determinant of neuronal number in the mammalian cortex. We find that three paralogs of human-specific NOTCH2NL are highly expressed in radial glia. Functional analysis reveals that different alleles of NOTCH2NL have varying potencies to enhance Notch signaling by interacting directly with NOTCH receptors. Consistent with a role in Notch signaling, NOTCH2NL ectopic expression delays differentiation of neuronal progenitors, while deletion accelerates differentiation into cortical neurons. Furthermore, NOTCH2NL genes provide the breakpoints in 1q21.1 distal deletion/duplication syndrome, where duplications are associated with macrocephaly and autism and deletions with microcephaly and schizophrenia. Thus, the emergence of human-specific NOTCH2NL genes may have contributed to the rapid evolution of the larger human neocortex, accompanied by loss of genomic stability at the 1q21.1 locus and resulting recurrent neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Drosophila melanogaster has a rich repertoire of innate and learned behaviors. Its 100,000-neuron brain is a large but tractable target for comprehensive neural circuit mapping. Only electron microscopy (EM) enables complete, unbiased mapping of synaptic connectivity; however, the fly brain is too large for conventional EM. We developed a custom high-throughput EM platform and imaged the entire brain of an adult female fly at synaptic resolution. To validate the dataset, we traced brain-spanning circuitry involving the mushroom body (MB), which has been extensively studied for its role in learning. All inputs to Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the MB, were mapped, revealing a previously unknown cell type, postsynaptic partners of KC dendrites, and unexpected clustering of olfactory projection neurons. These reconstructions show that this freely available EM volume supports mapping of brain-spanning circuits, which will significantly accelerate Drosophila neuroscience.

Abstract: Summary
We examined how the immune microenvironment molds tumor evolution at different metastatic organs in a longitudinal dataset of colorectal cancer. Through multiplexed analyses, we showed that clonal evolution patterns during metastatic progression depend on the immune contexture at the metastatic site. Genetic evidence of neoantigen depletion was observed in the sites with high Immunoscore and spatial proximity between Ki67+ tumor cells and CD3+ cells. The immunoedited tumor clones were eliminated and did not recur, while progressing clones were immune privileged, despite the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Characterization of immune-privileged metastases revealed tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic mechanisms of escape. The lowest recurrence risk was associated with high Immunoscore, occurrence of immunoediting, and low tumor burden. We propose a parallel selection model of metastatic progression, where branched evolution could be traced back to immune-escaping clones. The findings could inform the understanding of cancer dissemination and the development of immunotherapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory disorders of the CNS are frequently accompanied by synaptic loss, which is thought to involve phagocytic microglia and complement components. However, the mechanisms accounting for aberrant synaptic connectivity in the context of CD8+ T cell-driven neuronal damage are poorly understood. Here, we profiled the neuronal translatome in a murine model of encephalitis caused by CD8+ T cells targeting antigenic neurons. Neuronal STAT1 signaling and downstream CCL2 expression were essential for apposition of phagocytes, ensuing synaptic loss and neurological disease. Analogous observations were made in the brains of Rasmussen’s encephalitis patients. In this devastating CD8+ T cell-driven autoimmune disease, neuronal STAT1 phosphorylation and CCL2 expression co-clustered with infiltrating CD8+ T cells as well as phagocytes. Taken together, our findings uncover an active role of neurons in coordinating phagocyte-mediated synaptic loss and highlight neuronal STAT1 and CCL2 as critical steps in this process that are amenable to pharmacological interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), are a growing public health concern. Systems-level analysis of how flaviviruses hijack cellular processes through virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) provides information about their replication and pathogenic mechanisms. We used affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to compare flavivirus-host interactions for two viruses (DENV and ZIKV) in two hosts (human and mosquito). Conserved virus-host PPIs revealed that the flavivirus NS5 protein suppresses interferon stimulated genes by inhibiting recruitment of the transcription complex PAF1C and that chemical modulation of SEC61 inhibits DENV and ZIKV replication in human and mosquito cells. Finally, we identified a ZIKV-specific interaction between NS4A and ANKLE2, a gene linked to hereditary microcephaly, and showed that ZIKV NS4A causes microcephaly in Drosophila in an ANKLE2-dependent manner. Thus, comparative flavivirus-host PPI mapping provides biological insights and, when coupled with in vivo models, can be used to unravel pathogenic mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
During corticogenesis, ventricular zone progenitors sequentially generate distinct subtypes of neurons, accounting for the diversity of neocortical cells and the circuits they form. While activity-dependent processes are critical for the differentiation and circuit assembly of postmitotic neurons, how bioelectrical processes affect nonexcitable cells, such as progenitors, remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal that, in the developing mouse neocortex, ventricular zone progenitors become more hyperpolarized as they generate successive subtypes of neurons. Experimental in vivo hyperpolarization shifted the transcriptional programs and division modes of these progenitors to a later developmental status, with precocious generation of intermediate progenitors and a forward shift in the laminar, molecular, morphological, and circuit features of their neuronal progeny. These effects occurred through inhibition of the Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway by hyperpolarization. Thus, during corticogenesis, bioelectric membrane properties are permissive for specific molecular pathways to coordinate the temporal progression of progenitor developmental programs and thus neocortical neuron diversity.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro cancer cultures, including three-dimensional organoids, typically contain exclusively neoplastic epithelium but require artificial reconstitution to recapitulate the tumor microenvironment (TME). The co-culture of primary tumor epithelia with endogenous, syngeneic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as a cohesive unit has been particularly elusive. Here, an air-liquid interface (ALI) method propagated patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from >100 human biopsies or mouse tumors in syngeneic immunocompetent hosts as tumor epithelia with native embedded immune cells (T, B, NK, macrophages). Robust droplet-based, single-cell simultaneous determination of gene expression and immune repertoire indicated that PDO TILs accurately preserved the original tumor T cell receptor (TCR) spectrum. Crucially, human and murine PDOs successfully modeled immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with anti-PD-1- and/or anti-PD-L1 expanding and activating tumor antigen-specific TILs and eliciting tumor cytotoxicity. Organoid-based propagation of primary tumor epithelium en bloc with endogenous immune stroma should enable immuno-oncology investigations within the TME and facilitate personalized immunotherapy testing.

Abstract: Summary
Cirmtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets ROR1, an oncoembryonic orphan receptor for Wnt5a found on cancer stem cells (CSCs). Aberrant expression of ROR1 is seen in many malignancies and has been linked to Rho-GTPase activation and cancer stem cell self-renewal. For patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), self-renewing, neoplastic B cells express ROR1 in 95% of cases. High-level leukemia cell expression of ROR1 is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. We conducted a phase 1 study involving 26 patients with progressive, relapsed, or refractory CLL. Patients received four biweekly infusions, with doses ranging from 0.015 to 20 mg/kg. Cirmtuzumab had a long plasma half-life and did not have dose-limiting toxicity. Inhibition of ROR1 signaling was observed, including decreased activation of RhoA and HS1. Transcriptome analyses showed that therapy inhibited CLL stemness gene expression signatures in vivo. Cirmtuzumab is safe and effective at inhibiting tumor cell ROR1 signaling in patients with CLL.

Abstract: Summary
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a largely incurable hematological malignancy, is derived from aberrant clonal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) that persist after conventional therapies. Defining the mechanisms underlying MDS HSPC maintenance is critical for developing MDS therapy. The deacetylase SIRT1 regulates stem cell proliferation, survival, and self-renewal by deacetylating downstream proteins. Here we show that SIRT1 protein levels were downregulated in MDS HSPCs. Genetic or pharmacological activation of SIRT1 inhibited MDS HSPC functions, whereas SIRT1 deficiency enhanced MDS HSPC self-renewal. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effects of SIRT1 were dependent on TET2, a safeguard against HSPC transformation. SIRT1 deacetylated TET2 at conserved lysine residues in its catalytic domain, enhancing TET2 activity. Our genome-wide analysis identified cancer-related genes regulated by the SIRT1/TET2 axis. SIRT1 activation also inhibited functions of MDS HSPCs from patients with TET2 heterozygous mutations. Altogether, our results indicate that restoring TET2 function through SIRT1 activation represents a promising means to target MDS HSPCs.

Abstract: Summary
Heterogeneity is a hallmark feature of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates. Following infection, naive T cells differentiate into various subsets of effector and memory T cells, which help to eliminate pathogens and maintain long-term immunity. The current model suggests there is a single lineage of naive T cells that give rise to different populations of effector and memory T cells depending on the type and amounts of stimulation they encounter during infection. Here, we have discovered that multiple sub-populations of cells exist in the naive CD8+ T cell pool that are distinguished by their developmental origin, unique transcriptional profiles, distinct chromatin landscapes, and different kinetics and phenotypes after microbial challenge. These data demonstrate that the naive CD8+ T cell pool is not as homogeneous as previously thought and offers a new framework for explaining the remarkable heterogeneity in the effector and memory T cell subsets that arise after infection.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) 1 and 2 are essential chromatin regulators of cell identity. PRC1, a dominant executer of Polycomb-mediated control, functions as multiple sub-complexes that possess catalytic-dependent H2AK119 mono-ubiquitination (H2AK119ub) and catalytic-independent activities. Here, we show that, despite its well-established repressor functions, PRC1 binds to both silent and active genes. Through in vivo loss-of-function studies, we show that global PRC1 function is essential for skin development and stem cell (SC) specification, whereas PRC1 catalytic activity is dispensable. Further dissection demonstrated that both canonical and non-canonical PRC1 complexes bind to repressed genes, marked by H2AK119ub and PRC2-mediated H3K27me3. Interestingly, loss of canonical PRC1, PRC1 catalytic activity, or PRC2 leads to expansion of mechanosensitive Merkel cells in neonatal skin. Non-canonical PRC1 complexes, however, also bind to and promote expression of genes critical for skin development and SC formation. Together, our findings highlight PRC1’s diverse roles in executing a precise developmental program.

Abstract: Summary
Many animals rely on vision to detect, locate, and track moving objects. In Drosophila courtship, males primarily use visual cues to orient toward and follow females and to select the ipsilateral wing for courtship song. Here, we show that the LC10 visual projection neurons convey essential visual information during courtship. Males with LC10 neurons silenced are unable to orient toward or maintain proximity to the female and do not predominantly use the ipsilateral wing when singing. LC10 neurons preferentially respond to small moving objects using an antagonistic motion-based center-surround mechanism. Unilateral activation of LC10 neurons recapitulates the orienting and ipsilateral wing extension normally elicited by females, and the potency with which LC10 induces wing extension is enhanced in a state of courtship arousal controlled by male-specific P1 neurons. These data suggest that LC10 is a major pathway relaying visual input to the courtship circuits in the male brain.

Abstract: Summary
Akt is a critical protein kinase that drives cancer proliferation, modulates metabolism, and is activated by C-terminal phosphorylation. The current structural model for Akt activation by C-terminal phosphorylation has centered on intramolecular interactions between the C-terminal tail and the N lobe of the kinase domain. Here, we employ expressed protein ligation to produce site-specifically phosphorylated forms of purified Akt1 that are well suited for mechanistic analysis. Using biochemical, crystallographic, and cellular approaches, we determine that pSer473-Akt activation is driven by an intramolecular interaction between the C-tail and the pleckstrin homology (PH)-kinase domain linker that relieves PH domain-mediated Akt1 autoinhibition. Moreover, dual phosphorylation at Ser477/Thr479 activates Akt1 through a different allosteric mechanism via an apparent activation loop interaction that reduces autoinhibition by the PH domain and weakens PIP3 affinity. These results provide a new framework for understanding how Akt is controlled in cell signaling and suggest distinct functions for differentially modified Akt forms.

Abstract: Summary
Resistance to chemotherapy plays a significant role in cancer mortality. To identify genetic units affecting sensitivity to cytarabine, the mainstay of treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we developed a comprehensive and integrated genome-wide platform based on a dual protein-coding and non-coding integrated CRISPRa screening (DICaS). Putative resistance genes were initially identified using pharmacogenetic data from 760 human pan-cancer cell lines. Subsequently, genome scale functional characterization of both coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes by CRISPR activation was performed. For lncRNA functional assessment, we developed a CRISPR activation of lncRNA (CaLR) strategy, targeting 14,701 lncRNA genes. Computational and functional analysis identified novel cell-cycle, survival/apoptosis, and cancer signaling genes. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of the GAS6-AS2 lncRNA, identified in our analysis, leads to hyperactivation of the GAS6/TAM pathway, a resistance mechanism in multiple cancers including AML. Thus, DICaS represents a novel and powerful approach to identify integrated coding and non-coding pathways of therapeutic relevance.

Abstract: Summary
Recent sequencing analyses have shed light on heterogeneous patterns of genomic aberrations in human gastric cancers (GCs). To explore how individual genetic events translate into cancer phenotypes, we established a biological library consisting of genetically engineered gastric organoids carrying various GC mutations and 37 patient-derived organoid lines, including rare genomically stable GCs. Phenotype analyses of GC organoids revealed divergent genetic and epigenetic routes to gain Wnt and R-spondin niche independency. An unbiased phenotype-based genetic screening identified a significant association between CDH1/TP53 compound mutations and the R-spondin independency that was functionally validated by CRISPR-based knockout. Xenografting of GC organoids further established the feasibility of Wnt-targeting therapy for Wnt-dependent GCs. Our results collectively demonstrate that multifaceted genetic abnormalities render human GCs independent of the stem cell niche and highlight the validity of the genotype-phenotype screening strategy in gaining deeper understanding of human cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Generally repressed by epigenetic mechanisms, retrotransposons represent around 40% of the murine genome. At the Agouti viable yellow (Avy) locus, an endogenous retrovirus (ERV) of the intracisternal A particle (IAP) class retrotransposed upstream of the agouti coat-color locus, providing an alternative promoter that is variably DNA methylated in genetically identical individuals. This results in variable expressivity of coat color that is inherited transgenerationally. Here, a systematic genome-wide screen identifies multiple C57BL/6J murine IAPs with Avy epigenetic properties. Each exhibits a stable methylation state within an individual but varies between individuals. Only in rare instances do they act as promoters controlling adjacent gene expression. Their methylation state is locus-specific within an individual, and their flanking regions are enriched for CTCF. Variably methylated IAPs are reprogrammed after fertilization and re-established as variable loci in the next generation, indicating reconstruction of metastable epigenetic states and challenging the generalizability of non-genetic inheritance at these regions.

Abstract: Summary
Although current immune-checkpoint therapy (ICT) mainly targets lymphoid cells, it is associated with a broader remodeling of the tumor micro-environment. Here, using complementary forms of high-dimensional profiling, we define differences across all hematopoietic cells from syngeneic mouse tumors during unrestrained tumor growth or effective ICT. Unbiased assessment of gene expression of tumor-infiltrating cells by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and longitudinal assessment of cellular protein expression by mass cytometry (CyTOF) revealed significant remodeling of both the lymphoid and myeloid intratumoral compartments. Surprisingly, we observed multiple subpopulations of monocytes/macrophages, distinguishable by the markers CD206, CX3CR1, CD1d, and iNOS, that change over time during ICT in a manner partially dependent on IFNγ. Our data support the hypothesis that this macrophage polarization/activation results from effects on circulatory monocytes and early macrophages entering tumors, rather than on pre-polarized mature intratumoral macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Mutation rates along the genome are highly variable and influenced by several chromatin features. Here, we addressed how nucleosomes, the most pervasive chromatin structure in eukaryotes, affect the generation of mutations. We discovered that within nucleosomes, the somatic mutation rate across several tumor cohorts exhibits a strong 10 base pair (bp) periodicity. This periodic pattern tracks the alternation of the DNA minor groove facing toward and away from the histones. The strength and phase of the mutation rate periodicity are determined by the mutational processes active in tumors. We uncovered similar periodic patterns in the genetic variation among human and Arabidopsis populations, also detectable in their divergence from close species, indicating that the same principles underlie germline and somatic mutation rates. We propose that differential DNA damage and repair processes dependent on the minor groove orientation in nucleosome-bound DNA contribute to the 10-bp periodicity in AT/CG content in eukaryotic genomes.

Abstract: Summary
Global profiling of protein expression through the cell cycle has revealed subsets of periodically expressed proteins. However, expression levels alone only give a partial view of the biochemical processes determining cellular events. Using a proteome-wide implementation of the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) to study specific cell-cycle phases, we uncover changes of interaction states for more than 750 proteins during the cell cycle. Notably, many protein complexes are modulated in specific cell-cycle phases, reflecting their roles in processes such as DNA replication, chromatin remodeling, transcription, translation, and disintegration of the nuclear envelope. Surprisingly, only small differences in the interaction states were seen between the G1 and the G2 phase, suggesting similar hardwiring of biochemical processes in these two phases. The present work reveals novel molecular details of the cell cycle and establishes proteome-wide CETSA as a new strategy to study modulation of protein-interaction states in intact cells.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV accessory protein Nef counteracts immune defenses by subverting coated vesicle pathways. The 3.7 Å cryo-EM structure of a closed trimer of the clathrin adaptor AP-1, the small GTPase Arf1, HIV-1 Nef, and the cytosolic tail of the restriction factor tetherin suggested a mechanism for inactivating tetherin by Golgi retention. The 4.3 Å structure of a mutant Nef-induced dimer of AP-1 showed how the closed trimer is regulated by the dileucine loop of Nef. HDX-MS and mutational analysis were used to show how cargo dynamics leads to alternative Arf1 trimerization, directing Nef targets to be either retained at the trans-Golgi or sorted to lysosomes. Phosphorylation of the NL4-3 M-Nef was shown to regulate AP-1 trimerization, explaining how O-Nefs lacking this phosphosite counteract tetherin but most M-Nefs do not. These observations show how the higher-order organization of a vesicular coat can be allosterically modulated to direct cargoes to distinct fates.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic social isolation causes severe psychological effects in humans, but their neural bases remain poorly understood. 2 weeks (but not 24 hr) of social isolation stress (SIS) caused multiple behavioral changes in mice and induced brain-wide upregulation of the neuropeptide tachykinin 2 (Tac2)/neurokinin B (NkB). Systemic administration of an Nk3R antagonist prevented virtually all of the behavioral effects of chronic SIS. Conversely, enhancing NkB expression and release phenocopied SIS in group-housed mice, promoting aggression and converting stimulus-locked defensive behaviors to persistent responses. Multiplexed analysis of Tac2/NkB function in multiple brain areas revealed dissociable, region-specific requirements for both the peptide and its receptor in different SIS-induced behavioral changes. Thus, Tac2 coordinates a pleiotropic brain state caused by SIS via a distributed mode of action. These data reveal the profound effects of prolonged social isolation on brain chemistry and function and suggest potential new therapeutic applications for Nk3R antagonists.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic cell fates are defined by transcription factors that are rapidly deployed, yet attempts to visualize these factors in vivo often fail because of slow fluorescent protein maturation. Here, we pioneer a protein tag, LlamaTag, which circumvents this maturation limit by binding mature fluorescent proteins, making it possible to visualize transcription factor concentration dynamics in live embryos. Implementing this approach in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we discovered stochastic bursts in the concentration of transcription factors that are correlated with bursts in transcription. We further used LlamaTags to show that the concentration of protein in a given nucleus heavily depends on transcription of that gene in neighboring nuclei; we speculate that this inter-nuclear signaling is an important mechanism for coordinating gene expression to delineate straight and sharp boundaries of gene expression. Thus, LlamaTags now make it possible to visualize the flow of information along the central dogma in live embryos.

Abstract: Summary
The development of complex in vitro hepatic systems and artificial liver devices has been hampered by the lack of reliable sources for relevant cell types, such as hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Here we report efficient differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into HSC-like cells (iPSC-HSCs). iPSC-HSCs closely resemble primary human HSCs at the transcriptional, cellular, and functional levels and possess a gene expression profile intermediate between that of quiescent and activated HSCs. Functional analyses revealed that iPSC-HSCs accumulate retinyl esters in lipid droplets and are activated in response to mediators of wound healing, similar to their in vivo counterparts. When maintained as 3D spheroids with HepaRG hepatocytes, iPSC-HSCs exhibit a quiescent phenotype but mount a fibrogenic response and secrete pro-collagen in response to known stimuli and hepatocyte toxicity. Thus, this protocol provides a robust in vitro system for studying HSC development, modeling liver fibrosis, and drug toxicity screening.

Abstract: Summary
The dorsal raphe (DR) constitutes a major serotonergic input to the forebrain and modulates diverse functions and brain states, including mood, anxiety, and sensory and motor functions. Most functional studies to date have treated DR serotonin neurons as a single population. Using viral-genetic methods, we found that subcortical- and cortical-projecting serotonin neurons have distinct cell-body distributions within the DR and differentially co-express a vesicular glutamate transporter. Further, amygdala- and frontal-cortex-projecting DR serotonin neurons have largely complementary whole-brain collateralization patterns, receive biased inputs from presynaptic partners, and exhibit opposite responses to aversive stimuli. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments suggest that amygdala-projecting DR serotonin neurons promote anxiety-like behavior, whereas frontal-cortex-projecting neurons promote active coping in the face of challenge. These results provide compelling evidence that the DR serotonin system contains parallel sub-systems that differ in input and output connectivity, physiological response properties, and behavioral functions.

Abstract: Summary
Detection of viruses by innate immune sensors induces protective antiviral immunity. The viral DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is necessary for detection of HIV by human dendritic cells and macrophages. However, synthesis of HIV DNA during infection is not sufficient for immune activation. The capsid protein, which associates with viral DNA, has a pivotal role in enabling cGAS-mediated immune activation. We now find that NONO is an essential sensor of the HIV capsid in the nucleus. NONO protein directly binds capsid with higher affinity for weakly pathogenic HIV-2 than highly pathogenic HIV-1. Upon infection, NONO is essential for cGAS activation by HIV and cGAS association with HIV DNA in the nucleus. NONO recognizes a conserved region in HIV capsid with limited tolerance for escape mutations. Detection of nuclear viral capsid by NONO to promote DNA sensing by cGAS reveals an innate strategy to achieve distinction of viruses from self in the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
The SET1/MLL family of histone methyltransferases is conserved in eukaryotes and regulates transcription by catalyzing histone H3K4 mono-, di-, and tri-methylation. These enzymes form a common five-subunit catalytic core whose assembly is critical for their basal and regulated enzymatic activities through unknown mechanisms. Here, we present the crystal structure of the intact yeast COMPASS histone methyltransferase catalytic module consisting of Swd1, Swd3, Bre2, Sdc1, and Set1. The complex is organized by Swd1, whose conserved C-terminal tail not only nucleates Swd3 and a Bre2-Sdc1 subcomplex, but also joins Set1 to construct a regulatory pocket next to the catalytic site. This inter-subunit pocket is targeted by a previously unrecognized enzyme-modulating motif in Swd3 and features a doorstop-style mechanism dictating substrate selectivity among SET1/MLL family members. By spatially mapping the functional components of COMPASS, our results provide a structural framework for understanding the multifaceted functions and regulation of the H3K4 methyltransferase family.

Abstract: Summary
The methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is carried out by an evolutionarily conserved family of methyltransferases referred to as complex of proteins associated with Set1 (COMPASS). The activity of the catalytic SET domain (su(var)3-9, enhancer-of-zeste, and trithorax) is endowed through forming a complex with a set of core proteins that are widely shared from yeast to humans. We obtained cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps of the yeast Set1/COMPASS core complex at overall 4.0- to 4.4-Å resolution, providing insights into its structural organization and conformational dynamics. The Cps50 C-terminal tail weaves within the complex to provide a central scaffold for assembly. The SET domain, snugly positioned at the junction of the Y-shaped complex, is extensively contacted by Cps60 (Bre2), Cps50 (Swd1), and Cps30 (Swd3). The mobile SET-I motif of the SET domain is engaged by Cps30, explaining its key role in COMPASS catalytic activity toward higher H3K4 methylation states.

Abstract: Summary
The organization of action into sequences underlies complex behaviors that are essential for organismal survival and reproduction. Despite extensive studies of innate sequences in relation to central pattern generators, how learned action sequences are controlled and whether they are organized as a chain or a hierarchy remain largely unknown. By training mice to perform heterogeneous action sequences, we demonstrate that striatal direct and indirect pathways preferentially encode different behavioral levels of sequence structure. State-dependent closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of the striatal direct pathway can selectively insert a single action element into the sequence without disrupting the overall sequence length. Optogenetic manipulation of the striatal indirect pathway completely removes the ongoing subsequence while leaving the following subsequence to be executed with the appropriate timing and length. These results suggest that learned action sequences are not organized in a serial but rather a hierarchical structure that is distinctly controlled by basal ganglia pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes are multi-subunit molecular machines that play vital roles in regulating genomic architecture and are frequently disrupted in human cancer and developmental disorders. To date, the modular organization and pathways of assembly of these chromatin regulators remain unknown, presenting a major barrier to structural and functional determination. Here, we elucidate the architecture and assembly pathway across three classes of mSWI/SNF complexes—canonical BRG1/BRM-associated factor (BAF), polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF), and newly defined ncBAF complexes—and define the requirement of each subunit for complex formation and stability. Using affinity purification of endogenous complexes from mammalian and Drosophila cells coupled with cross-linking mass spectrometry (CX-MS) and mutagenesis, we uncover three distinct and evolutionarily conserved modules, their organization, and the temporal incorporation of these modules into each complete mSWI/SNF complex class. Finally, we map human disease-associated mutations within subunits and modules, defining specific topological regions that are affected upon subunit perturbation.

Abstract: Summary
The super elongation complex (SEC) is required for robust and productive transcription through release of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with its P-TEFb module and promoting transcriptional processivity with its ELL2 subunit. Malfunction of SEC contributes to multiple human diseases including cancer. Here, we identify peptidomimetic lead compounds, KL-1 and its structural homolog KL-2, which disrupt the interaction between the SEC scaffolding protein AFF4 and P-TEFb, resulting in impaired release of Pol II from promoter-proximal pause sites and a reduced average rate of processive transcription elongation. SEC is required for induction of heat-shock genes and treating cells with KL-1 and KL-2 attenuates the heat-shock response from Drosophila to human. SEC inhibition downregulates MYC and MYC-dependent transcriptional programs in mammalian cells and delays tumor progression in a mouse xenograft model of MYC-driven cancer, indicating that small-molecule disruptors of SEC could be used for targeted therapy of MYC-induced cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular and mechanistic bases underlying endothelial regeneration of adult large vessels have proven challenging to study. Using a reproducible in vivo aortic endothelial injury model, we characterized cellular dynamics underlying the regenerative process through a combination of multi-color lineage tracing, parabiosis, and single-cell transcriptomics. We found that regeneration is a biphasic process driven by distinct populations arising from differentiated endothelial cells. The majority of cells immediately adjacent to the injury site re-enter the cell cycle during the initial damage response, with a second phase driven by a highly proliferative subpopulation. Endothelial regeneration requires activation of stress response genes including Atf3, and aged aortas compromised in their reparative capacity express less Atf3. Deletion of Atf3 reduced endothelial proliferation and compromised the regeneration. These findings provide important insights into cellular dynamics and mechanisms that drive responses to large vessel injury.

Abstract: Summary
Much of our understanding of chromosome segregation is based on cell culture systems. Here, we examine the importance of the tissue environment for chromosome segregation by comparing chromosome segregation fidelity across several primary cell types in native and nonnative contexts. We discover that epithelial cells have increased chromosome missegregation outside of their native tissues. Using organoid culture systems, we show that tissue architecture, specifically integrin function, is required for accurate chromosome segregation. We find that tissue architecture enhances the correction of merotelic microtubule-kinetochore attachments, and this is especially important for maintaining chromosome stability in the polyploid liver. We propose that disruption of tissue architecture could underlie the widespread chromosome instability across epithelial cancers. Moreover, our findings highlight the extent to which extracellular context can influence intrinsic cellular processes and the limitations of cell culture systems for studying cells that naturally function within a tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Many naturalistic behaviors are built from modular components that are expressed sequentially. Although striatal circuits have been implicated in action selection and implementation, the neural mechanisms that compose behavior in unrestrained animals are not well understood. Here, we record bulk and cellular neural activity in the direct and indirect pathways of dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as mice spontaneously express action sequences. These experiments reveal that DLS neurons systematically encode information about the identity and ordering of sub-second 3D behavioral motifs; this encoding is facilitated by fast-timescale decorrelations between the direct and indirect pathways. Furthermore, lesioning the DLS prevents appropriate sequence assembly during exploratory or odor-evoked behaviors. By characterizing naturalistic behavior at neural timescales, these experiments identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics built from complementary pathway dynamics, support a role for DLS in constructing meaningful behavioral sequences, and suggest models for how actions are sculpted over time.

Abstract: Summary
Defining mechanisms that maintain tissue stem cells during homeostasis, stress, and aging is important for improving tissue regeneration and repair and enhancing cancer therapies. Here, we show that Id1 is induced in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by cytokines that promote HSC proliferation and differentiation, suggesting that it functions in stress hematopoiesis. Genetic ablation of Id1 increases HSC self-renewal in serial bone marrow transplantation (BMT) assays, correlating with decreases in HSC proliferation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Id1−/− HSCs have a quiescent molecular signature and harbor less DNA damage than control HSCs. Cytokines produced in the hematopoietic microenvironment after γ-irradiation induce Id1 expression. Id1−/− HSCs display a blunted proliferative response to such cytokines and other inducers of chronic proliferation including genotoxic and inflammatory stress and aging, protecting them from chronic stress and exhaustion. Thus, targeting Id1 may be therapeutically useful for improving HSC survival and function during BMT, chronic stress, and aging.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is the canonical type I viral envelope glycoprotein and provides a template for the membrane-fusion mechanisms of numerous viruses. The current model of HA-mediated membrane fusion describes a static “spring-loaded” fusion domain (HA2) at neutral pH. Acidic pH triggers a singular irreversible conformational rearrangement in HA2 that fuses viral and cellular membranes. Here, using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET)-imaging, we directly visualized pH-triggered conformational changes of HA trimers on the viral surface. Our analyses reveal reversible exchange between the pre-fusion and two intermediate conformations of HA2. Acidification of pH and receptor binding shifts the dynamic equilibrium of HA2 in favor of forward progression along the membrane-fusion reaction coordinate. Interaction with the target membrane promotes irreversible transition of HA2 to the post-fusion state. The reversibility of HA2 conformation may protect against transition to the post-fusion state prior to arrival at the target membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Biological signaling networks use feedback control to dynamically adjust their operation in real time. Traditional static genetic methods such as gene knockouts or rescue experiments can often identify the existence of feedback interactions but are unable to determine what feedback dynamics are required. Here, we implement a new strategy, closed-loop optogenetic compensation (CLOC), to address this problem. Using a custom-built hardware and software infrastructure, CLOC monitors, in real time, the output of a pathway deleted for a feedback regulator. A minimal model uses these measurements to calculate and deliver—on the fly—an optogenetically enabled transcriptional input designed to compensate for the effects of the feedback deletion. Application of CLOC to the yeast pheromone response pathway revealed surprisingly distinct dynamic requirements for three well-studied feedback regulators. CLOC, a marriage of control theory and traditional genetics, presents a broadly applicable methodology for defining the dynamic function of biological feedback regulators.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell regulation and hierarchical organization of human skeletal progenitors remain largely unexplored. Here, we report the isolation of a self-renewing and multipotent human skeletal stem cell (hSSC) that generates progenitors of bone, cartilage, and stroma, but not fat. Self-renewing and multipotent hSSCs are present in fetal and adult bones and can also be derived from BMP2-treated human adipose stroma (B-HAS) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Gene expression analysis of individual hSSCs reveals overall similarity between hSSCs obtained from different sources and partially explains skewed differentiation toward cartilage in fetal and iPSC-derived hSSCs. hSSCs undergo local expansion in response to acute skeletal injury. In addition, hSSC-derived stroma can maintain human hematopoietic stem cells (hHSCs) in serum-free culture conditions. Finally, we combine gene expression and epigenetic data of mouse skeletal stem cells (mSSCs) and hSSCs to identify evolutionarily conserved and divergent pathways driving SSC-mediated skeletogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors regulate the molecular, morphological, and physiological characteristics of neurons and generate their impressive cell-type diversity. To gain insight into the general principles that govern how transcription factors regulate cell-type diversity, we used large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the extensive cellular diversity in the Drosophila optic lobes. We sequenced 55,000 single cells and assigned them to 52 clusters. We validated and annotated many clusters using RNA sequencing of FACS-sorted single-cell types and cluster-specific genes. To identify transcription factors responsible for inducing specific terminal differentiation features, we generated a “random forest” model, and we showed that the transcription factors Apterous and Traffic-jam are required in many but not all cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons, respectively. In fact, the same terminal characters often can be regulated by different transcription factors in different cell types, arguing for extensive phenotypic convergence. Our data provide a deep understanding of the developmental and functional specification of a complex brain structure.

Abstract: Summary
The intestinal epithelium is a highly structured tissue composed of repeating crypt-villus units. Enterocytes perform the diverse tasks of absorbing a wide range of nutrients while protecting the body from the harsh bacterium-rich environment. It is unknown whether these tasks are spatially zonated along the villus axis. Here, we extracted a large panel of landmark genes characterized by transcriptomics of laser capture microdissected villus segments and utilized it for single-cell spatial reconstruction, uncovering broad zonation of enterocyte function along the villus. We found that enterocytes at villus bottoms express an anti-bacterial gene program in a microbiome-dependent manner. They next shift to sequential expression of carbohydrates, peptides, and fat absorption machineries in distinct villus compartments. Finally, they induce a Cd73 immune-modulatory program at the villus tips. Our approach can be used to uncover zonation patterns in other organs when prior knowledge of landmark genes is lacking.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) conduct nucleocytoplasmic transport through an FG domain-controlled barrier. We now explore how surface-features of a mobile species determine its NPC passage rate. Negative charges and lysines impede passage. Hydrophobic residues, certain polar residues (Cys, His), and, surprisingly, charged arginines have striking translocation-promoting effects. Favorable cation-π interactions between arginines and FG-phenylalanines may explain this apparent paradox. Application of these principles to redesign the surface of GFP resulted in variants that show a wide span of transit rates, ranging from 35-fold slower than wild-type to ∼500 times faster, with the latter outpacing even naturally occurring nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). The structure of a fast and particularly FG-specific GFPNTR variant illustrates how NTRs can expose multiple regions for binding hydrophobic FG motifs while evading non-specific aggregation. Finally, we document that even for NTR-mediated transport, the surface-properties of the “passively carried” cargo can strikingly affect the translocation rate.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular reprogramming converts differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, this process is typically very inefficient, complicating mechanistic studies. We identified and molecularly characterized rare, early intermediates poised to reprogram with up to 95% efficiency, without perturbing additional genes or pathways, during iPSC generation from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Analysis of these cells uncovered transcription factors (e.g., Tfap2c and Bex2) that are important for reprogramming but dispensable for pluripotency maintenance. Additionally, we observed striking patterns of chromatin hyperaccessibility at pluripotency loci, which preceded gene expression in poised intermediates. Finally, inspection of these hyperaccessible regions revealed an early wave of DNA demethylation that is uncoupled from de novo methylation of somatic regions late in reprogramming. Our study underscores the importance of investigating rare intermediates poised to produce iPSCs, provides insights into reprogramming mechanisms, and offers a valuable resource for the dissection of transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics intrinsic to cell fate change.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogenesis generates mature male gametes and is critical for the proper transmission of genetic information between generations. However, the developmental landscapes of human spermatogenesis remain unknown. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis for 2,854 testicular cells from donors with normal spermatogenesis and 174 testicular cells from one nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) donor. A hierarchical model was established, which was characterized by the sequential and stepwise development of three spermatogonia subtypes, seven spermatocyte subtypes, and four spermatid subtypes. Further analysis identified several stage-specific marker genes of human germ cells, such as HMGA1, PIWIL4, TEX29, SCML1, and CCDC112. Moreover, we identified altered gene expression patterns in the testicular somatic cells of one NOA patient via scRNA-seq analysis, paving the way for further diagnosis of male infertility. Our work allows for the reconstruction of transcriptional programs inherent to sequential cell fate transition during human spermatogenesis and has implications for deciphering male-related reproductive disorders.

Abstract: Summary
In familial searching in forensic genetics, a query DNA profile is tested against a database to determine whether it represents a relative of a database entrant. We examine the potential for using linkage disequilibrium to identify pairs of profiles as belonging to relatives when the query and database rely on nonoverlapping genetic markers. Considering data on individuals genotyped with both microsatellites used in forensic applications and genome-wide SNPs, we find that ∼30%–32% of parent-offspring pairs and ∼35%–36% of sib pairs can be identified from the SNPs of one member of the pair and the microsatellites of the other. The method suggests the possibility of performing familial searches of microsatellite databases using query SNP profiles, or vice versa. It also reveals that privacy concerns arising from computations across multiple databases that share no genetic markers in common entail risks, not only for database entrants, but for their close relatives as well.

Abstract: Summary
A key aspect of genomic medicine is to make individualized clinical decisions from personal genomes. We developed a machine-learning framework to integrate personal genomes and electronic health record (EHR) data and used this framework to study abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a prevalent irreversible cardiovascular disease with unclear etiology. Performing whole-genome sequencing on AAA patients and controls, we demonstrated its predictive precision solely from personal genomes. By modeling personal genomes with EHRs, this framework quantitatively assessed the effectiveness of adjusting personal lifestyles given personal genome baselines, demonstrating its utility as a personal health management tool. We showed that this new framework agnostically identified genetic components involved in AAA, which were subsequently validated in human aortic tissues and in murine models. Our study presents a new framework for disease genome analysis, which can be used for both health management and understanding the biological architecture of complex diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The immune system is critical in modulating cancer progression, but knowledge of immune composition, phenotype, and interactions with tumor is limited. We used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF) to simultaneously quantify in situ expression of 36 proteins covering identity, function, and immune regulation at sub-cellular resolution in 41 triple-negative breast cancer patients. Multi-step processing, including deep-learning-based segmentation, revealed variability in the composition of tumor-immune populations across individuals, reconciled by overall immune infiltration and enriched co-occurrence of immune subpopulations and checkpoint expression. Spatial enrichment analysis showed immune mixed and compartmentalized tumors, coinciding with expression of PD1, PD-L1, and IDO in a cell-type- and location-specific manner. Ordered immune structures along the tumor-immune border were associated with compartmentalization and linked to survival. These data demonstrate organization in the tumor-immune microenvironment that is structured in cellular composition, spatial arrangement, and regulatory-protein expression and provide a framework to apply multiplexed imaging to immune oncology.

Abstract: Summary
Treatment of cancer has been revolutionized by immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Despite the high rate of response in advanced melanoma, the majority of patients succumb to disease. To identify factors associated with success or failure of checkpoint therapy, we profiled transcriptomes of 16,291 individual immune cells from 48 tumor samples of melanoma patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors. Two distinct states of CD8+ T cells were defined by clustering and associated with patient tumor regression or progression. A single transcription factor, TCF7, was visualized within CD8+ T cells in fixed tumor samples and predicted positive clinical outcome in an independent cohort of checkpoint-treated patients. We delineated the epigenetic landscape and clonality of these T cell states and demonstrated enhanced antitumor immunity by targeting novel combinations of factors in exhausted cells. Our study of immune cell transcriptomes from tumors demonstrates a strategy for identifying predictors, mechanisms, and targets for enhancing checkpoint immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical deep projection neurons (DPNs) are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Although recent findings emphasize post-mitotic programs in projection neuron fate selection, the establishment of primate DPN identity during layer formation is not well understood. The subplate lies underneath the developing cortex and is a post-mitotic compartment that is transiently and disproportionately enlarged in primates in the second trimester. The evolutionary significance of subplate expansion, the molecular identity of its neurons, and its contribution to primate corticogenesis remain open questions. By modeling subplate formation with human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we show that all classes of cortical DPNs can be specified from subplate neurons (SPNs). Post-mitotic WNT signaling regulates DPN class selection, and DPNs in the caudal fetal cortex appear to exclusively derive from SPNs. Our findings indicate that SPNs have evolved in primates as an important source of DPNs that contribute to cortical lamination prior to their known role in circuit formation.

Abstract: Summary
Neanderthals and modern humans interbred at least twice in the past 100,000 years. While there is evidence that most introgressed DNA segments from Neanderthals to modern humans were removed by purifying selection, less is known about the adaptive nature of introgressed sequences that were retained. We hypothesized that interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans led to (1) the exposure of each species to novel viruses and (2) the exchange of adaptive alleles that provided resistance against these viruses. Here, we find that long, frequent—and more likely adaptive—segments of Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans are enriched for proteins that interact with viruses (VIPs). We found that VIPs that interact specifically with RNA viruses were more likely to belong to introgressed segments in modern Europeans. Our results show that retained segments of Neanderthal ancestry can be used to detect ancient epidemics.

Abstract: Summary
CKIα ablation induces p53 activation, and CKIα degradation underlies the therapeutic effect of lenalidomide in a pre-leukemia syndrome. Here we describe the development of CKIα inhibitors, which co-target the transcriptional kinases CDK7 and CDK9, thereby augmenting CKIα-induced p53 activation and its anti-leukemic activity. Oncogene-driving super-enhancers (SEs) are highly sensitive to CDK7/9 inhibition. We identified multiple newly gained SEs in primary mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and demonstrate that the inhibitors abolish many SEs and preferentially suppress the transcription elongation of SE-driven oncogenes. We show that blocking CKIα together with CDK7 and/or CDK9 synergistically stabilize p53, deprive leukemia cells of survival and proliferation-maintaining SE-driven oncogenes, and induce apoptosis. Leukemia progenitors are selectively eliminated by the inhibitors, explaining their therapeutic efficacy with preserved hematopoiesis and leukemia cure potential; they eradicate leukemia in MLL-AF9 and Tet2−/−;Flt3ITD AML mouse models and in several patient-derived AML xenograft models, supporting their potential efficacy in curing human leukemia.

We identified a CAR containing the transmembrane domain of NKG2D, the 2B4 co-stimulatory domain, and the CD3ζ signaling domain to mediate strong antigen-specific NK cell signaling. NK cells derived from human iPSCs that express this CAR (NK-CAR-iPSC-NK cells) have a typical NK cell phenotype and demonstrate improved anti-tumor activity compared with T-CAR-expressing iPSC-derived NK cells (T-CAR-iPSC-NK cells) and non-CAR-expressing cells. In an ovarian cancer xenograft model, NK-CAR-iPSC-NK cells significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival compared with PB-NK cells, iPSC-NK cells, or T-CAR-iPSC-NK cells. Additionally, NK-CAR-iPSC-NK cells demonstrate in vivo activity similar to that of T-CAR-expressing T cells, although with less toxicity. These NK-CAR-iPSC-NK cells now provide standardized, targeted “off-the-shelf” lymphocytes for anti-cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
We tested the feasibility and safety of human-spinal-cord-derived neural stem cell (NSI-566) transplantation for the treatment of chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). In this clinical trial, four subjects with T2–T12 SCI received treatment consisting of removal of spinal instrumentation, laminectomy, and durotomy, followed by six midline bilateral stereotactic injections of NSI-566 cells. All subjects tolerated the procedure well and there have been no serious adverse events to date (18–27 months post-grafting). In two subjects, one to two levels of neurological improvement were detected using ISNCSCI motor and sensory scores. Our results support the safety of NSI-566 transplantation into the SCI site and early signs of potential efficacy in three of the subjects warrant further exploration of NSI-566 cells in dose escalation studies. Despite these encouraging secondary data, we emphasize that this safety trial lacks statistical power or a control group needed to evaluate functional changes resulting from cell grafting.

Abstract: Summary
The prostate cancer (PCa) risk-associated SNP rs11672691 is positively associated with aggressive disease at diagnosis. We showed that rs11672691 maps to the promoter of a short isoform of long noncoding RNA PCAT19 (PCAT19-short), which is in the third intron of the long isoform (PCAT19-long). The risk variant is associated with decreased and increased levels of PCAT19-short and PCAT19-long, respectively. Mechanistically, the risk SNP region is bifunctional with both promoter and enhancer activity. The risk variants of rs11672691 and its LD SNP rs887391 decrease binding of transcription factors NKX3.1 and YY1 to the promoter of PCAT19-short, resulting in weaker promoter but stronger enhancer activity that subsequently activates PCAT19-long. PCAT19-long interacts with HNRNPAB to activate a subset of cell-cycle genes associated with PCa progression, thereby promoting PCa tumor growth and metastasis. Taken together, these findings reveal a risk SNP-mediated promoter-enhancer switching mechanism underlying both initiation and progression of aggressive PCa.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is a major risk factor for both genetic and sporadic neurodegenerative disorders. However, it is unclear how aging interacts with genetic predispositions to promote neurodegeneration. Here, we investigate how partial loss of function of TBK1, a major genetic cause for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) comorbidity, leads to age-dependent neurodegeneration. We show that TBK1 is an endogenous inhibitor of RIPK1 and the embryonic lethality of Tbk1−/− mice is dependent on RIPK1 kinase activity. In aging human brains, another endogenous RIPK1 inhibitor, TAK1, exhibits a marked decrease in expression. We show that in Tbk1+/− mice, the reduced myeloid TAK1 expression promotes all the key hallmarks of ALS/FTD, including neuroinflammation, TDP-43 aggregation, axonal degeneration, neuronal loss, and behavior deficits, which are blocked upon inhibition of RIPK1. Thus, aging facilitates RIPK1 activation by reducing TAK1 expression, which cooperates with genetic risk factors to promote the onset of ALS/FTD.

Abstract: Summary
Epidemiological data suggest that early life exposures are key determinants of immune-mediated disease later in life. Young children are also particularly susceptible to infections, warranting more analyses of immune system development early in life. Such analyses mostly have been performed in mouse models or human cord blood samples, but these cannot account for the complex environmental exposures influencing human newborns after birth. Here, we performed longitudinal analyses in 100 newborn children, sampled up to 4 times during their first 3 months of life. From 100 μL of blood, we analyze the development of 58 immune cell populations by mass cytometry and 267 plasma proteins by immunoassays, uncovering drastic changes not predictable from cord blood measurements but following a stereotypic pattern. Preterm and term children differ at birth but converge onto a shared trajectory, seemingly driven by microbial interactions and hampered by early gut bacterial dysbiosis.

Abstract: Summary
We analyze whole-genome sequencing data from 141,431 Chinese women generated for non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). We use these data to characterize the population genetic structure and to investigate genetic associations with maternal and infectious traits. We show that the present day distribution of alleles is a function of both ancient migration and very recent population movements. We reveal novel phenotype-genotype associations, including several replicated associations with height and BMI, an association between maternal age and EMB, and between twin pregnancy and NRG1. Finally, we identify a unique pattern of circulating viral DNA in plasma with high prevalence of hepatitis B and other clinically relevant maternal infections. A GWAS for viral infections identifies an exceptionally strong association between integrated herpesvirus 6 and MOV10L1, which affects piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) processing and PIWI protein function. These findings demonstrate the great value and potential of accumulating NIPT data for worldwide medical and genetic analyses.

Abstract: Summary
Newborn mice emit signals that promote parenting from mothers and fathers but trigger aggressive responses from virgin males. Although pup-directed attacks by males require vomeronasal function, the specific infant cues that elicit this behavior are unknown. We developed a behavioral paradigm based on reconstituted pup cues and showed that discrete infant morphological features combined with salivary chemosignals elicit robust male aggression. Seven vomeronasal receptors were identified based on infant-mediated activity, and the involvement of two receptors, Vmn2r65 and Vmn2r88, in infant-directed aggression was demonstrated by genetic deletion. Using the activation of these receptors as readouts for biochemical fractionation, we isolated two pheromonal compounds, the submandibular gland protein C and hemoglobins. Unexpectedly, none of the identified vomeronasal receptors and associated cues were specific to pups. Thus, infant-mediated aggression by virgin males relies on the recognition of pup’s physical traits in addition to parental and infant chemical cues.

Abstract: Summary
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified rs11672691 at 19q13 associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we independently confirmed the finding in a cohort of 2,738 PCa patients and discovered the biological mechanism underlying this association. We found an association of the aggressive PCa-associated allele G of rs11672691 with elevated transcript levels of two biologically plausible candidate genes, PCAT19 and CEACAM21, implicated in PCa cell growth and tumor progression. Mechanistically, rs11672691 resides in an enhancer element and alters the binding site of HOXA2, a novel oncogenic transcription factor with prognostic potential in PCa. Remarkably, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated single-nucleotide editing showed the direct effect of rs11672691 on PCAT19 and CEACAM21 expression and PCa cellular aggressive phenotype. Clinical data demonstrated synergistic effects of rs11672691 genotype and PCAT19/CEACAM21 gene expression on PCa prognosis. These results provide a plausible mechanism for rs11672691 associated with aggressive PCa and thus lay the ground work for translating this finding to the clinic.

Abstract: Summary
Hedgehog protein signals mediate tissue patterning and maintenance by binding to and inactivating their common receptor Patched, a 12-transmembrane protein that otherwise would suppress the activity of the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened. Loss of Patched function, the most common cause of basal cell carcinoma, permits unregulated activation of Smoothened and of the Hedgehog pathway. A cryo-EM structure of the Patched protein reveals striking transmembrane domain similarities to prokaryotic RND transporters. A central hydrophobic conduit with cholesterol-like contents courses through the extracellular domain and resembles that used by other RND proteins to transport substrates, suggesting Patched activity in cholesterol transport. Cholesterol activity in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is reduced by PTCH1 expression but rapidly restored by Hedgehog stimulation, suggesting that PTCH1 regulates Smoothened by controlling cholesterol availability.

Abstract: Summary
Light exerts a range of powerful biological effects beyond image vision, including mood and learning regulation. While the source of photic information affecting mood and cognitive functions is well established, viz. intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), the central mediators are unknown. Here, we reveal that the direct effects of light on learning and mood utilize distinct ipRGC output streams. ipRGCs that project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) mediate the effects of light on learning, independently of the SCN’s pacemaker function. Mood regulation by light, on the other hand, requires an SCN-independent pathway linking ipRGCs to a previously unrecognized thalamic region, termed perihabenular nucleus (PHb). The PHb is integrated in a distinctive circuitry with mood-regulating centers and is both necessary and sufficient for driving the effects of light on affective behavior. Together, these results provide new insights into the neural basis required for light to influence mood and learning.

Abstract: Summary
Paneth cells are post-mitotic intestinal epithelial cells supporting the stem cell niche and mucosal immunity. Paneth cell pathologies are observed in various gastrointestinal diseases, but their plasticity and response to genomic and environmental challenges remain unclear. Using a knockin allele engineered at the mouse Lyz1 locus, we performed detailed Paneth cell-lineage tracing. Irradiation induced a subset of Paneth cells to proliferate and differentiate into villus epithelial cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that Paneth cells sorted from irradiated mice acquired a stem cell-like transcriptome; when cultured in vitro, these individual Paneth cells formed organoids. Irradiation activated Notch signaling, and forced expression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in Paneth cells, but not Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, induced their dedifferentiation. This study documents Paneth cell plasticity, particularly their ability to participate in epithelial replenishment following stem cell loss, adding to a growing body of knowledge detailing the molecular pathways controlling injury-induced regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancers are genetic elements that regulate spatiotemporal gene expression. Enhancer function requires transcription factor (TF) binding and correlates with histone modifications. However, the extent to which TF binding and histone modifications functionally define active enhancers remains unclear. Here, we combine chromatin immunoprecipitation with a massively parallel reporter assay (ChIP-STARR-seq) to identify functional enhancers in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) genome-wide in a quantitative unbiased manner. Although active enhancers associate with TFs, only a minority of regions marked by NANOG, OCT4, H3K27ac, and H3K4me1 function as enhancers, with activity markedly changing under naive versus primed culture conditions. We identify an enhancer set associated with functions extending to non-ESC-specific processes. Moreover, although transposable elements associate with putative enhancers, only some exhibit activity. Similarly, within super-enhancers, large tracts are non-functional, with activity restricted to small sub-domains. This catalog of validated enhancers provides a valuable resource for further functional dissection of the regulatory genome.

Abstract: Summary
Organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells are a potentially powerful tool for high-throughput screening (HTS), but the complexity of organoid cultures poses a significant challenge for miniaturization and automation. Here, we present a fully automated, HTS-compatible platform for enhanced differentiation and phenotyping of human kidney organoids. The entire 21-day protocol, from plating to differentiation to analysis, can be performed automatically by liquid-handling robots, or alternatively by manual pipetting. High-content imaging analysis reveals both dose-dependent and threshold effects during organoid differentiation. Immunofluorescence and single-cell RNA sequencing identify previously undetected parietal, interstitial, and partially differentiated compartments within organoids and define conditions that greatly expand the vascular endothelium. Chemical modulation of toxicity and disease phenotypes can be quantified for safety and efficacy prediction. Screening in gene-edited organoids in this system reveals an unexpected role for myosin in polycystic kidney disease. Organoids in HTS formats thus establish an attractive platform for multidimensional phenotypic screening.

Abstract: Summary
The mouse trachea is thought to contain two distinct stem cell compartments that contribute to airway repair—basal cells in the surface airway epithelium (SAE) and an unknown submucosal gland (SMG) cell type. Whether a lineage relationship exists between these two stem cell compartments remains unclear. Using lineage tracing of glandular myoepithelial cells (MECs), we demonstrate that MECs can give rise to seven cell types of the SAE and SMGs following severe airway injury. MECs progressively adopted a basal cell phenotype on the SAE and established lasting progenitors capable of further regeneration following reinjury. MECs activate Wnt-regulated transcription factors (Lef-1/TCF7) following injury and Lef-1 induction in cultured MECs promoted transition to a basal cell phenotype. Surprisingly, dose-dependent MEC conditional activation of Lef-1 in vivo promoted self-limited airway regeneration in the absence of injury. Thus, modulating the Lef-1 transcriptional program in MEC-derived progenitors may have regenerative medicine applications for lung diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Tools to understand how the spliceosome functions in vivo have lagged behind advances in the structural biology of the spliceosome. Here, methods are described to globally profile spliceosome-bound pre-mRNA, intermediates, and spliced mRNA at nucleotide resolution. These tools are applied to three yeast species that span 600 million years of evolution. The sensitivity of the approach enables the detection of canonical and non-canonical events, including interrupted, recursive, and nested splicing. This application of statistical modeling uncovers independent roles for the size and position of the intron and the number of introns per transcript in substrate progression through the two catalytic stages. These include species-specific inputs suggestive of spliceosome-transcriptome coevolution. Further investigations reveal the ATP-dependent discard of numerous endogenous substrates after spliceosome assembly in vivo and connect this discard to intron retention, a form of splicing regulation. Spliceosome profiling is a quantitative, generalizable global technology used to investigate an RNP central to eukaryotic gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins are required for synaptogenesis. The molecular mechanisms for coordinated synthesis of these proteins are not understood. Using forward genetic screens, we identified the conserved THO nuclear export complex (THOC) as an important regulator of presynapse development in C. elegans dopaminergic neurons. In THOC mutants, synaptic messenger RNAs are retained in the nucleus, resulting in dramatic decrease of synaptic protein expression, near complete loss of synapses, and compromised dopamine function. CRE binding protein (CREB) interacts with THOC to mark synaptic transcripts for efficient nuclear export. Deletion of Thoc5, a THOC subunit, in mouse dopaminergic neurons causes severe defects in synapse maintenance and subsequent neuronal death in the substantia nigra compacta. These cellular defects lead to abrogated dopamine release, ataxia, and animal death. Together, our results argue that nuclear export mechanisms can select specific mRNAs and be a rate-limiting step for neuronal differentiation and survival.

Abstract: Summary
Kidney organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells have great utility for investigating organogenesis and disease mechanisms and, potentially, as a replacement tissue source, but how closely organoids derived from current protocols replicate adult human kidney is undefined. We compared two directed differentiation protocols by single-cell transcriptomics of 83,130 cells from 65 organoids with single-cell transcriptomes of fetal and adult kidney cells. Both protocols generate a diverse range of kidney cells with differing ratios, but organoid-derived cell types are immature, and 10%–20% of cells are non-renal. Reconstructing lineage relationships by pseudotemporal ordering identified ligands, receptors, and transcription factor networks associated with fate decisions. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its cognate receptor NTRK2 were expressed in the neuronal lineage during organoid differentiation. Inhibiting this pathway improved organoid formation by reducing neurons by 90% without affecting kidney differentiation, highlighting the power of single-cell technologies to characterize and improve organoid differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short protein segments that can transport cargos into cells. Although CPPs are widely studied as potential drug delivery tools, their role in normal cell physiology is poorly understood. Early during infection, the L2 capsid protein of human papillomaviruses binds retromer, a cytoplasmic trafficking factor required for delivery of the incoming non-enveloped virus into the retrograde transport pathway. Here, we show that the C terminus of HPV L2 proteins contains a conserved cationic CPP that drives passage of a segment of the L2 protein through the endosomal membrane into the cytoplasm, where it binds retromer, thereby sorting the virus into the retrograde pathway for transport to the trans-Golgi network. These experiments define the cell-autonomous biological role of a CPP in its natural context and reveal how a luminal viral protein engages an essential cytoplasmic entry factor.

Abstract: Summary
Many community- and hospital-acquired bacterial infections are caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) predisposes humans to invasive infections that are difficult to eradicate. We designed a closed-loop gene network programming mammalian cells to autonomously detect and eliminate bacterial infections. The genetic circuit contains human Toll-like receptors as the bacterial sensor and a synthetic promoter driving reversible and adjustable expression of lysostaphin, a bacteriolytic enzyme highly lethal to S. aureus. Immunomimetic designer cells harboring this genetic circuit exhibited fast and robust sense-and-destroy kinetics against live staphylococci. When tested in a foreign-body infection model in mice, microencapsulated cell implants prevented planktonic MRSA infection and reduced MRSA biofilm formation by 91%. Notably, this system achieved a 100% cure rate of acute MRSA infections, whereas conventional vancomycin treatment failed. These results suggest that immunomimetic designer cells could offer a therapeutic approach for early detection, prevention, and cure of pathogenic infections in the post-antibiotic era.

Abstract: Summary
The acetyltransferases CBP and p300 are multifunctional transcriptional co-activators. Here, we combined quantitative proteomics with CBP/p300-specific catalytic inhibitors, bromodomain inhibitor, and gene knockout to reveal a comprehensive map of regulated acetylation sites and their dynamic turnover rates. CBP/p300 acetylates thousands of sites, including signature histone sites and a multitude of sites on signaling effectors and enhancer-associated transcriptional regulators. Time-resolved acetylome analyses identified a subset of CBP/p300-regulated sites with very rapid (<30 min) acetylation turnover, revealing a dynamic balance between acetylation and deacetylation. Quantification of acetylation, mRNA, and protein abundance after CBP/p300 inhibition reveals a kinetically competent network of gene expression that strictly depends on CBP/p300-catalyzed rapid acetylation. Collectively, our in-depth acetylome analyses reveal systems attributes of CBP/p300 targets, and the resource dataset provides a framework for investigating CBP/p300 functions and for understanding the impact of small-molecule inhibitors targeting its catalytic and bromodomain activities.

Abstract: Summary
Land plants evolved from charophytic algae, among which Charophyceae possess the most complex body plans. We present the genome of Chara braunii; comparison of the genome to those of land plants identified evolutionary novelties for plant terrestrialization and land plant heritage genes. C. braunii employs unique xylan synthases for cell wall biosynthesis, a phragmoplast (cell separation) mechanism similar to that of land plants, and many phytohormones. C. braunii plastids are controlled via land-plant-like retrograde signaling, and transcriptional regulation is more elaborate than in other algae. The morphological complexity of this organism may result from expanded gene families, with three cases of particular note: genes effecting tolerance to reactive oxygen species (ROS), LysM receptor-like kinases, and transcription factors (TFs). Transcriptomic analysis of sexual reproductive structures reveals intricate control by TFs, activity of the ROS gene network, and the ancestral use of plant-like storage and stress protection proteins in the zygote.

Abstract: Summary
More than 25 inherited human disorders are caused by the unstable expansion of repetitive DNA sequences termed short tandem repeats (STRs). A fundamental unresolved question is why some STRs are susceptible to pathologic expansion, whereas thousands of repeat tracts across the human genome are relatively stable. Here, we discover that nearly all disease-associated STRs (daSTRs) are located at boundaries demarcating 3D chromatin domains. We identify a subset of boundaries with markedly higher CpG island density compared to the rest of the genome. daSTRs specifically localize to ultra-high-density CpG island boundaries, suggesting they might be hotspots for epigenetic misregulation or topological disruption linked to STR expansion. Fragile X syndrome patients exhibit severe boundary disruption in a manner that correlates with local loss of CTCF occupancy and the degree of FMR1 silencing. Our data uncover higher-order chromatin architecture as a new dimension in understanding repeat expansion disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Replication origins, fragile sites, and rDNA have been implicated as sources of chromosomal instability. However, the defining genomic features of replication origins and fragile sites are among the least understood elements of eukaryote genomes. Here, we map sites of replication initiation and breakage in primary cells at high resolution. We find that replication initiates between transcribed genes within nucleosome-depleted structures established by long asymmetrical poly(dA:dT) tracts flanking the initiation site. Paradoxically, long (>20 bp) (dA:dT) tracts are also preferential sites of polar replication fork stalling and collapse within early-replicating fragile sites (ERFSs) and late-replicating common fragile sites (CFSs) and at the rDNA replication fork barrier. Poly(dA:dT) sequences are fragile because long single-strand poly(dA) stretches at the replication fork are unprotected by the replication protein A (RPA). We propose that the evolutionary expansion of poly(dA:dT) tracts in eukaryotic genomes promotes replication initiation, but at the cost of chromosome fragility.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the benefits of individual microbiota-derived molecules in host animals is important for understanding the symbiosis between humans and their microbiota. The bacteria-secreted enterobactin (Ent) is an iron scavenging siderophore with presumed negative effects on hosts. However, the high prevalence of Ent-producing commensal bacteria in the human gut raises the intriguing question regarding a potential host mechanism to beneficially use Ent. We discovered an unexpected and striking role of Ent in supporting growth and the labile iron pool in C. elegans. We show that Ent promotes mitochondrial iron uptake and does so, surprisingly, by binding to the ATP synthase α subunit, which acts inside of mitochondria and independently of ATP synthase. We also demonstrated the conservation of this mechanism in mammalian cells. This study reveals a distinct paradigm for the “iron tug of war” between commensal bacteria and their hosts and an important mechanism for mitochondrial iron uptake and homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The activator and composition of the NLRP6 inflammasome remain poorly understood. We find that lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a molecule produced by Gram-positive bacteria, binds and activates NLRP6. In response to cytosolic LTA or infection with Listeria monocytogenes, NLRP6 recruited caspase-11 and caspase-1 via the adaptor ASC. NLRP6 activation by LTA induced processing of caspase-11, which promoted caspase-1 activation and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)/IL-18 maturation in macrophages. Nlrp6−/− and Casp11−/− mice were less susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection, which was associated with reduced pathogen loads and impaired IL-18 production. Administration of IL-18 to Nlrp6−/− or Casp11−/− mice restored the susceptibility of mutant mice to L. monocytogenes infection. These results reveal a previously unrecognized innate immunity pathway triggered by cytosolic LTA that is sensed by NLRP6 and exacerbates systemic Gram-positive pathogen infection via the production of IL-18.

Abstract: Summary
The cell wall, a defining feature of plants, provides a rigid structure critical for bonding cells together. To overcome this physical constraint, plants must process cell wall linkages during growth and development. However, little is known about the mechanism guiding cell-cell detachment and cell wall remodeling. Here, we identify two neighboring cell types in Arabidopsis that coordinate their activities to control cell wall processing, thereby ensuring precise abscission to discard organs. One cell type produces a honeycomb structure of lignin, which acts as a mechanical “brace” to localize cell wall breakdown and spatially limit abscising cells. The second cell type undergoes transdifferentiation into epidermal cells, forming protective cuticle, demonstrating de novo specification of epidermal cells, previously thought to be restricted to embryogenesis. Loss of the lignin brace leads to inadequate cuticle formation, resulting in surface barrier defects and susceptible to infection. Together, we show how plants precisely accomplish abscission.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is linked to functional deterioration and hematological diseases. The hematopoietic system is maintained by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and dysfunction within the HSC compartment is thought to be a key mechanism underlying age-related hematopoietic perturbations. Using single-cell transplantation assays with five blood-lineage analysis, we previously identified myeloid-restricted repopulating progenitors (MyRPs) within the phenotypic HSC compartment in young mice. Here, we determined the age-related functional changes to the HSC compartment using over 400 single-cell transplantation assays. Notably, MyRP frequency increased dramatically with age, while multipotent HSCs expanded modestly within the bone marrow. We also identified a subset of functional cells that were myeloid restricted in primary recipients but displayed multipotent (five blood-lineage) output in secondary recipients. We have termed this cell type latent-HSCs, which appear exclusive to the aged HSC compartment. These results question the traditional dogma of HSC aging and our current approaches to assay and define HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is believed to underlie formation of biomolecular condensates, cellular compartments that concentrate macromolecules without surrounding membranes. Physical mechanisms that control condensate formation/dissolution are poorly understood. The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the importin karyopherin-β2/transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of karyopherin-β2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses reveal weak interactions of karyopherin-β2 with sequence elements and structural domains distributed throughout the entirety of FUS. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that most of these same regions also contribute to LLPS of FUS. The data lead to a model where high-affinity binding of karyopherin-β2 to the FUS PY-NLS tethers the proteins together, allowing multiple, distributed weak intermolecular contacts to disrupt FUS self-association, blocking LLPS. Karyopherin-β2 may act analogously to control condensates in diverse cellular contexts.

Abstract: Summary
As a critical step during innate response, the cytoplasmic β subunit (IFN-γR2) of interferon-γ receptor (IFN-γR) is induced and translocates to plasma membrane to join α subunit to form functional IFN-γR to mediate IFN-γ signaling. However, the mechanism driving membrane translocation and its significance remain largely unknown. We found, unexpectedly, that mice deficient in E-selectin, an endothelial cell-specific adhesion molecule, displayed impaired innate activation of macrophages upon Listeria monocytogenes infection yet had increased circulating IFN-γ. Inflammatory macrophages from E-selectin-deficient mice had less surface IFN-γR2 and impaired IFN-γ signaling. BTK elicited by extrinsic E-selectin engagement phosphorylates cytoplasmic IFN-γR2, facilitating EFhd2 binding and promoting IFN-γR2 trafficking from Golgi to cell membrane. Our findings demonstrate that membrane translocation of cytoplasmic IFN-γR2 is required to activate macrophage innate response against intracellular bacterial infection, identifying the assembly of functional cytokine receptors on cell membrane as an important layer in innate activation and cytokine signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Although chronic gastrointestinal dysmotility syndromes are a common worldwide health problem, underlying causes for these disorders are poorly understood. We show that flavivirus infection of enteric neurons leads to acute neuronal injury and cell death, inflammation, bowel dilation, and slowing of intestinal transit in mice. Flavivirus-primed CD8+ T cells promote these phenotypes, as their absence diminished enteric neuron injury and intestinal transit delays, and their adoptive transfer reestablished dysmotility after flavivirus infection. Remarkably, mice surviving acute flavivirus infection developed chronic gastrointestinal dysmotility that was exacerbated by immunization with an unrelated alphavirus vaccine or exposure to a non-infectious inflammatory stimulus. This model of chronic post-infectious gastrointestinal dysmotility in mice suggests that viral infections with tropism for enteric neurons and the ensuing immune response might contribute to the development of bowel motility disorders in humans. These results suggest an opportunity for unique approaches to diagnosis and therapy of gastrointestinal dysmotility syndromes.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) can be triggered in a cell-non-autonomous fashion across multiple tissues in response to mitochondrial dysfunction. The ability to communicate information about the presence of mitochondrial stress enables a global response that can ultimately better protect an organism from local mitochondrial challenges. We find that animals use retromer-dependent Wnt signaling to propagate mitochondrial stress signals from the nervous system to peripheral tissues. Specifically, the polyQ40-triggered activation of mitochondrial stress or reduction of cco-1 (complex IV subunit) in neurons of C. elegans results in the Wnt-dependent induction of cell-non-autonomous UPRmt in peripheral cells. Loss-of-function mutations of retromer complex components that are responsible for recycling the Wnt secretion-factor/MIG-14 prevent Wnt secretion and thereby suppress cell-non-autonomous UPRmt. Neuronal expression of the Wnt ligand/EGL-20 is sufficient to induce cell-non-autonomous UPRmt in a retromer complex-, Wnt signaling-, and serotonin-dependent manner, clearly implicating Wnt signaling as a strong candidate for the “mitokine” signal.

Abstract: Summary
How transcription affects genome 3D organization is not well understood. We found that during influenza A (IAV) infection, rampant transcription rapidly reorganizes host cell chromatin interactions. These changes occur at the ends of highly transcribed genes, where global inhibition of transcription termination by IAV NS1 protein causes readthrough transcription for hundreds of kilobases. In these readthrough regions, elongating RNA polymerase II disrupts chromatin interactions by inducing cohesin displacement from CTCF sites, leading to locus decompaction. Readthrough transcription into heterochromatin regions switches them from the inert (B) to the permissive (A) chromatin compartment and enables transcription factor binding. Data from non-viral transcription stimuli show that transcription similarly affects cohesin-mediated chromatin contacts within gene bodies. Conversely, inhibition of transcription elongation allows cohesin to accumulate at previously transcribed intragenic CTCF sites and to mediate chromatin looping and compaction. Our data indicate that transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II remodels genome 3D architecture.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into a 3-dimensional structure in the nucleus. Current methods for studying genome-wide structure are based on proximity ligation. However, this approach can fail to detect known structures, such as interactions with nuclear bodies, because these DNA regions can be too far apart to directly ligate. Accordingly, our overall understanding of genome organization remains incomplete. Here, we develop split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE), a method that enables genome-wide detection of higher-order interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known structures identified by proximity ligation and identify additional interactions occurring across larger distances, including two hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles. We show that a substantial fraction of the genome exhibits preferential organization relative to these nuclear bodies. Our results generate a global model whereby nuclear bodies act as inter-chromosomal hubs that shape the overall packaging of DNA in the nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
TCR-signaling strength generally correlates with peptide-MHC binding affinity; however, exceptions exist. We find high-affinity, yet non-stimulatory, interactions occur with high frequency in the human T cell repertoire. Here, we studied human TCRs that are refractory to activation by pMHC ligands despite robust binding. Analysis of 3D affinity, 2D dwell time, and crystal structures of stimulatory versus non-stimulatory TCR-pMHC interactions failed to account for their different signaling outcomes. Using yeast pMHC display, we identified peptide agonists of a formerly non-responsive TCR. Single-molecule force measurements demonstrated the emergence of catch bonds in the activating TCR-pMHC interactions, correlating with exclusion of CD45 from the TCR-APC contact site. Molecular dynamics simulations of TCR-pMHC disengagement distinguished agonist from non-agonist ligands based on the acquisition of catch bonds within the TCR-pMHC interface.

Abstract: Summary
The RIPK1-RIPK3 necrosome is an amyloid signaling complex that initiates TNF-induced necroptosis, serving in human immune defense, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. RIPK1 and RIPK3 associate through their RIP homotypic interaction motifs with consensus sequences IQIG (RIPK1) and VQVG (RIPK3). Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, we determined the high-resolution structure of the RIPK1-RIPK3 core. RIPK1 and RIPK3 alternately stack (RIPK1, RIPK3, RIPK1, RIPK3, etc.) to form heterotypic β sheets. Two such β sheets bind together along a compact hydrophobic interface featuring an unusual ladder of alternating Ser (from RIPK1) and Cys (from RIPK3). The crystal structure of a four-residue RIPK3 consensus sequence is consistent with the architecture determined by NMR. The RIPK1-RIPK3 core is the first detailed structure of a hetero-amyloid and provides a potential explanation for the specificity of hetero- over homo-amyloid formation and a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of signal transduction.

Abstract: Summary
The identity of tumor-initiating cells in many cancer types is unknown. Tumors often express genes associated with embryonic development, although the contributions of zygotic programs to tumor initiation and formation are poorly understood. Here, we show that regeneration-induced loss of quiescence in p53-deficient muscle stem cells (MuSCs) results in rhabdomyosarcoma formation with 100% penetrance. Genomic analyses of purified tumor cells revealed spontaneous and discrete oncogenic amplifications in MuSCs that drive tumorigenesis, including, but not limited to, the amplification of the cleavage-stage Dux transcription factor (TF) Duxbl. We further found that Dux factors drive an early embryonic gene signature that defines a molecular subtype across a broad range of human cancers. Duxbl initiates tumorigenesis by enforcing a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, and targeted inactivation of Duxbl specifically in Duxbl-expressing tumor cells abolishes their expansion. These findings reveal how regeneration and genomic instability can interact to activate zygotic genes that drive tumor initiation and growth.

Abstract: Summary
While mutations affecting protein-coding regions have been examined across many cancers, structural variants at the genome-wide level are still poorly defined. Through integrative deep whole-genome and -transcriptome analysis of 101 castration-resistant prostate cancer metastases (109X tumor/38X normal coverage), we identified structural variants altering critical regulators of tumorigenesis and progression not detectable by exome approaches. Notably, we observed amplification of an intergenic enhancer region 624 kb upstream of the androgen receptor (AR) in 81% of patients, correlating with increased AR expression. Tandem duplication hotspots also occur near MYC, in lncRNAs associated with post-translational MYC regulation. Classes of structural variations were linked to distinct DNA repair deficiencies, suggesting their etiology, including associations of CDK12 mutation with tandem duplications, TP53 inactivation with inverted rearrangements and chromothripsis, and BRCA2 inactivation with deletions. Together, these observations provide a comprehensive view of how structural variations affect critical regulators in metastatic prostate cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The assembly of phase-separated structures is thought to play an important role in development and disease, but little is known about the regulation and function of phase separation under physiological conditions. We showed that during C. elegans embryogenesis, PGL granules assemble via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and their size and biophysical properties determine their susceptibility to autophagic degradation. The receptor SEPA-1 promotes LLPS of PGL-1/-3, while the scaffold protein EPG-2 controls the size of PGL-1/-3 compartments and converts them into less dynamic gel-like structures. Under heat-stress conditions, mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of PGL-1/-3 is elevated and PGL-1/-3 undergo accelerated phase separation, forming PGL granules that are resistant to autophagic degradation. Significantly, accumulation of PGL granules is an adaptive response to maintain embryonic viability during heat stress. We revealed that mTORC1-mediated LLPS of PGL-1/-3 acts as a switch-like stress sensor, coupling phase separation to autophagic degradation and adaptation to stress during development.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic state of a cell is influenced by cell-extrinsic factors, including nutrient availability and growth factor signaling. Here, we present extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling as another fundamental node of cell-extrinsic metabolic regulation. Unbiased analysis of glycolytic drivers identified the hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor as being among the most highly correlated with glycolysis in cancer. Confirming a mechanistic link between the ECM component hyaluronan and metabolism, treatment of cells and xenografts with hyaluronidase triggers a robust increase in glycolysis. This is largely achieved through rapid receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated induction of the mRNA decay factor ZFP36, which targets TXNIP transcripts for degradation. Because TXNIP promotes internalization of the glucose transporter GLUT1, its acute decline enriches GLUT1 at the plasma membrane. Functionally, induction of glycolysis by hyaluronidase is required for concomitant acceleration of cell migration. This interconnection between ECM remodeling and metabolism is exhibited in dynamic tissue states, including tumorigenesis and embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The DNA-binding protein REST forms complexes with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to repress neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells. In differentiating neurons, REST is downregulated predominantly by transcriptional silencing. Here we report that post-transcriptional inactivation of REST by alternative splicing is required for hearing in humans and mice. We show that, in the mechanosensory hair cells of the mouse ear, regulated alternative splicing of a frameshift-causing exon into the Rest mRNA is essential for the derepression of many neuronal genes. Heterozygous deletion of this alternative exon of mouse Rest causes hair cell degeneration and deafness, and the HDAC inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) rescues the hearing of these mice. In humans, inhibition of the frameshifting splicing event by a novel REST variant is associated with dominantly inherited deafness. Our data reveal the necessity for alternative splicing-dependent regulation of REST in hair cells, and they identify a potential treatment for a group of hereditary deafness cases.

Abstract: Summary
The fluid-mosaic model posits a liquid-like plasma membrane, which can flow in response to tension gradients. It is widely assumed that membrane flow transmits local changes in membrane tension across the cell in milliseconds, mediating long-range signaling. Here, we show that propagation of membrane tension occurs quickly in cell-attached blebs but is largely suppressed in intact cells. The failure of tension to propagate in cells is explained by a fluid dynamical model that incorporates the flow resistance from cytoskeleton-bound transmembrane proteins. Perturbations to tension propagate diffusively, with a diffusion coefficient Dσ ∼0.024 μm2/s in HeLa cells. In primary endothelial cells, local increases in membrane tension lead only to local activation of mechanosensitive ion channels and to local vesicle fusion. Thus, membrane tension is not a mediator of long-range intracellular signaling, but local variations in tension mediate distinct processes in sub-cellular domains.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans and other nematodes have been thought to lack classical action potentials. Unexpectedly, we observe membrane potential spikes with defining characteristics of action potentials in C. elegans AWA olfactory neurons recorded under current-clamp conditions. Ion substitution experiments, mutant analysis, pharmacology, and modeling indicate that AWA fires calcium spikes, which are initiated by EGL-19 voltage-gated CaV1 calcium channels and terminated by SHK-1 Shaker-type potassium channels. AWA action potentials result in characteristic signals in calcium imaging experiments. These calcium signals are also observed when intact animals are exposed to odors, suggesting that natural odor stimuli induce AWA spiking. The stimuli that elicit action potentials match AWA’s specialized function in climbing odor gradients. Our results provide evidence that C. elegans neurons can encode information through regenerative all-or-none action potentials, expand the computational repertoire of its nervous system, and inform future modeling of its neural coding and network dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Reversible phase separation underpins the role of FUS in ribonucleoprotein granules and other membrane-free organelles and is, in part, driven by the intrinsically disordered low-complexity (LC) domain of FUS. Here, we report that cooperative cation-π interactions between tyrosines in the LC domain and arginines in structured C-terminal domains also contribute to phase separation. These interactions are modulated by post-translational arginine methylation, wherein arginine hypomethylation strongly promotes phase separation and gelation. Indeed, significant hypomethylation, which occurs in FUS-associated frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), induces FUS condensation into stable intermolecular β-sheet-rich hydrogels that disrupt RNP granule function and impair new protein synthesis in neuron terminals. We show that transportin acts as a physiological molecular chaperone of FUS in neuron terminals, reducing phase separation and gelation of methylated and hypomethylated FUS and rescuing protein synthesis. These results demonstrate how FUS condensation is physiologically regulated and how perturbations in these mechanisms can lead to disease.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian chromosomes are partitioned into A/B compartments and topologically associated domains (TADs). The inactive X (Xi) chromosome, however, adopts a distinct conformation without evident compartments or TADs. Here, through exploration of an architectural protein, structural-maintenance-of-chromosomes hinge domain containing 1 (SMCHD1), we probe how the Xi is reconfigured during X chromosome inactivation. A/B compartments are first fused into “S1” and “S2” compartments, coinciding with Xist spreading into gene-rich domains. SMCHD1 then binds S1/S2 compartments and merges them to create a compartment-less architecture. Contrary to current views, TADs remain on the Xi but in an attenuated state. Ablating SMCHD1 results in a persistent S1/S2 organization and strengthening of TADs. Furthermore, loss of SMCHD1 causes regional defects in Xist spreading and erosion of heterochromatic silencing. We present a stepwise model for Xi folding, where SMCHD1 attenuates a hidden layer of Xi architecture to facilitate Xist spreading.

Abstract: Summary
Acquired chromosomal DNA amplifications are features of many tumors. Although overexpression and stabilization of the histone H3 lysine 9/36 (H3K9/36) tri-demethylase KDM4A generates transient site-specific copy number gains (TSSGs), additional mechanisms directly controlling site-specific DNA copy gains are not well defined. In this study, we uncover a collection of H3K4-modifying chromatin regulators that function with H3K9 and H3K36 regulators to orchestrate TSSGs. Specifically, the H3K4 tri-demethylase KDM5A and specific COMPASS/KMT2 H3K4 methyltransferases modulate different TSSG loci through H3K4 methylation states and KDM4A recruitment. Furthermore, a distinct chromatin modifier network, MLL1-KDM4B-KDM5B, controls copy number regulation at a specific genomic locus in a KDM4A-independent manner. These pathways comprise an epigenetic addressing system for defining site-specific DNA rereplication and amplifications.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages protect the body from damage and disease by targeting antibody-opsonized cells for phagocytosis. Though antibodies can be raised against antigens with diverse structures, shapes, and sizes, it is unclear why some are more effective at triggering immune responses than others. Here, we define an antigen height threshold that regulates phagocytosis of both engineered and cancer-specific antigens by macrophages. Using a reconstituted model of antibody-opsonized target cells, we find that phagocytosis is dramatically impaired for antigens that position antibodies >10 nm from the target surface. Decreasing antigen height drives segregation of antibody-bound Fc receptors from the inhibitory phosphatase CD45 in an integrin-independent manner, triggering Fc receptor phosphorylation and promoting phagocytosis. Our work shows that close contact between macrophage and target is a requirement for efficient phagocytosis, suggesting that therapeutic antibodies should target short antigens in order to trigger Fc receptor activation through size-dependent physical segregation.

Abstract: Summary
During cell division, mitotic motors organize microtubules in the bipolar spindle into either polar arrays at the spindle poles or a “nematic” network of aligned microtubules at the spindle center. The reasons for the distinct self-organizing capacities of dynamic microtubules and different motors are not understood. Using in vitro reconstitution experiments and computer simulations, we show that the human mitotic motors kinesin-5 KIF11 and kinesin-14 HSET, despite opposite directionalities, can both organize dynamic microtubules into either polar or nematic networks. We show that in addition to the motor properties the natural asymmetry between microtubule plus- and minus-end growth critically contributes to the organizational potential of the motors. We identify two control parameters that capture system composition and kinetic properties and predict the outcome of microtubule network organization. These results elucidate a fundamental design principle of spindle bipolarity and establish general rules for active filament network organization.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages are highly heterogeneous tissue-resident immune cells that perform a variety of tissue-supportive functions. The current paradigm dictates that intestinal macrophages are continuously replaced by incoming monocytes that acquire a pro-inflammatory or tissue-protective signature. Here, we identify a self-maintaining population of macrophages that arise from both embryonic precursors and adult bone marrow-derived monocytes and persists throughout adulthood. Gene expression and imaging studies of self-maintaining macrophages revealed distinct transcriptional profiles that reflect their unique localization (i.e., closely positioned to blood vessels, submucosal and myenteric plexus, Paneth cells, and Peyer’s patches). Depletion of self-maintaining macrophages resulted in morphological abnormalities in the submucosal vasculature and loss of enteric neurons, leading to vascular leakage, impaired secretion, and reduced intestinal motility. These results provide critical insights in intestinal macrophage heterogeneity and demonstrate the strategic role of self-maintaining macrophages in gut homeostasis and intestinal physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Non-image-forming vision in mammals is mediated primarily by melanopsin-expressing, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). In mouse M1-ipRGCs, by far the best-studied subtype, melanopsin activates PLCβ4 (phospholipase C-β4) to open TRPC6,7 channels, mechanistically similar to phototransduction in fly rhabdomeric (microvillous) photoreceptors. We report here that, surprisingly, mouse M4-ipRGCs rely on a different and hitherto undescribed melanopsin-driven, ciliary phototransduction mechanism involving cyclic nucleotide as the second messenger and HCN channels rather than CNG channels as the ion channel for phototransduction. Even more surprisingly, within an individual mouse M2-ipRGC, this HCN-channel-dependent, ciliary phototransduction pathway operates in parallel with the TRPC6,7-dependent rhabdomeric pathway. These findings reveal a complex heterogeneity in phototransduction among ipRGCs and, more importantly, break a general dogma about segregation of the two phototransduction motifs, likely with strong evolutionary implications.
