Abstract: Activated CO2 adsorption sites are crucial for improving selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Co-catalysts incorporating rare or noble metals have previously been required to achieve high CO2 selectivity (SCO2); thus, noble-metal-free catalysts with high SCO2 are desirable but challenging to realize. We introduced S-scheme heterojunction using noble-metal-free TiO2/MoS2/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a strong redox ability showing SCO2 > 90%. This heterostructure improved CO2 conversion, to levels 3.1 times higher than that of the g-C3N4 alone and exhibited sufficient kinetic overpotential (0.18 eV) to produce significant amounts of CH4. When the proportion of g-C3N4 was optimized, the specified TiO2/MoS2/g-C3N4 achieved high SCO2 (~90%) due to its improved CO2 adsorption, in turn due to the improved specific surface area and pore size distribution attributable to amino (−NH2) groups of g-C3N4. We introduced, a novel, noble-metal-free TiO2/MoS2/g-C3N4 heterostructure that maximizes the number of CO2 adsorption sites and charge carriers separation through interconnected components, and thus increases SCO2.

Abstract: Objective/background
B-cell neoplasms are clonal tumors of B cells at various stages of maturation, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL), Burkitt lymphoma (BL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM), splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and hairy cell leukemia (HCL). In this study, we analyzed the frequency of MYD88 L265P mutation and its correlation with clinico-hematological profile in mature B-cell neoplasms.
Methods
A total of 110 consecutive cases of B-cell neoplasms showing peripheral blood and/or bone marrow infiltration were included. MYD88 L265P mutation was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of exon 5 of MYD88 gene, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
Results
Among the 110 cases, the major group was of CLL (54.5%, n = 60), followed by HCL. Other cases included MCL, LPL, DLBCL, SMZL, NMZL, FL, and BL. MYD88 L265P mutation was seen in 21 (19.1%) cases of B-cell neoplasm, whereas 89 (80.9%) cases were negative for MYD88 L265P mutation. It was most commonly seen in LPL/WM cases followed by HCL, SMZL, CLL, and MCL cases. No case of DLBCL, FL, and BL showed MYD88 L265P mutation. Statistically significant difference was seen for hemoglobin level in CLL cases, with MYD88 L265P mutated cases showing higher mean hemoglobin levels than MYD88 wild-type cases (p = .001). For other parameters, no statistically significant difference was noted between mutated and unmutated cases.
Conclusion
MYD88 L265P mutation is seen in various B-cell neoplasms; it is most commonly seen in LPL/WM cases but not specific for it.

Abstract: Sub-ambient radiative cooling has drawn abundant research interest, due to its great energy saving potential. However, the challenge of lacking suitable wind cover material seriously impedes its actual application. To address the challenge, the radiative cooling model with wind cover should be developed firstly. In this work, an accurate radiative cooling model considering the solar and mid-infrared transmissivity of wind cover is developed systematically. Subsequently, the radiative cooling experiments with the polyethylene film wind cover of different thickness are designed to validate the accuracy of the developed model. The experimental results demonstrate that wind cover has a significant impact on radiative cooling performance and the developed model has a high accuracy, with an average relative error of below 3%. Additionally, the developed model is used to investigate the radiative cooling performance in different areas. The modeling results indicate that radiative cooling has a great potential in arid areas. More significantly, feasible breakthrough route towards the rigid wind cover is discussed. The results indicate that the minimum target transmissivity of ultra-white glass and zinc selenide wind covers gradually improve with the increase of humidity. Our work provides a platform to address the challenge of lacking suitable wind cover and promotes the actual application of radiative cooling technology.

Abstract: Efficiency is an important factor in the utilization of solar energy. Direct absorption solar energy collectors (DASCs), a new generation collector of converting solar irradiation into heat directly by nanofluids, is regarded as a promising solution for capturing solar energy with high efficiency. Both good stability and high absorption ability are crucial for nanofluids to be an ideal working fluid of DASCs. In this work, we synthesize hyperstable Ti3C2Tx-H2O nanofluids as the working fluids of DASCs and investigate its photothermal conversion performance. The results show that the maximum conversion efficiency of thin-layer Ti3C2Tx nanofluids achieves 91.9% at a very low mass fraction of 0.02 wt%, which is higher than that of multi-layer Ti3C2Tx samples. Based on the experimental results, a simulation model is built to observe the radiation energy transformation in DASCs and results show that better photothermal performance of thin-layer MXene Ti3C2Tx stems from its stronger localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect. Besides, the coupling effect and the shape of Ti3C2Tx particles also play important roles in photothermal absorption and conversion. Based on our experimental and numerical results, the Ti3C2Tx-H2O nanofluids have great potential in solar energy harvesting.

Abstract: Ettringite-based thermochemical energy storage has been recommended to be used in buildings for thermal energy supply because of its low material cost (<1000 €/m3), low working temperature and high energy storage capacity. However, several physicochemical properties of ettringite were still not clear, such as reversible reaction enthalpies, thermodynamic equilibrium, and kinetics of the dehydration/hydration reactions. In this study, the dehydration of ettringite was experimentally confirmed as stepwise in TGA-DSC, Ett30.6 → Ett30 → Met 17.8 → Met11.7 → Met7.5, which is consistent with the inference according to the crystal structure. The thermodynamic equilibrium of the reversible reactions presented the impact of water activity on the stability of ettringite at controlled temperatures and water vapor partial pressures. The thermodynamic modeling based on experiment results is consistent with the extrapolated model from the literature. The rehydration enthalpy of ettringite has been confirmed about 1370 kJ/mol, which equals an energy density of 547 kWh/m3 under the operating conditions of 20 °C and 90% RH.

Abstract: Water scarcity is a big challenge especially for developing countries and desert areas like Saudi Arabia. Using solar energy for freshwater production is the way forward for future development of the water industry. The present study developed a new composite sensible heat storage tubes (CSHSTs) to improve the freshwater productivity of a tubular solar still activated by a parabolic concentrator solar tracking system. 12-CSHSTs were inserted inside the trough of the tubular solar still forming heterogeneous cavities for the saline water. Each CSHST consists of three main solid components (black painted aluminum tube, copper wire and silica sand). The experimental work was conducted under the climatic conditions of Ha'il city in Saudi Arabia. Results showed enhancements by 24.05% and 20.06% in the freshwater yield and thermal daily efficiency, respectively. The developed device produced 4.9 L/m2day with 13% lower freshwater production cost of $0.0087 per liter. Inserting the 12-CSHSTs inside the trough with the heterogeneous cavities increased the contact area with the saline water. This novel configuration enhanced significantly the heat transfer mechanism. The developed device showed higher performance compared to the previous studies in the literature.

Abstract: Fibrotic diseases account for more than 8 million deaths worldwide annually. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been shown to activate pyroptosis and promote the production of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, leading to fibrosis development. However, the role of dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1)-induced ROS production and pyroptosis in cardiac fibrosis remains largely unknown. Activin A was used to induce ROS and pyroptosis in cardiomyocytes. ROS level, pyroptosis, and cytokine production were detected using Active Oxygen Detection Kit, flow cytometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. Western blotting analysis was used to measure expression changes of proteins. DUOX1 was silenced or overexpressed to investigate its role in fibrosis. We found that activin A induced ROS production and pyroptosis in cardiomyocytes, which was blocked by the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Knockdown of DUOX1 reversed activin A-induced ROS production, pyroptosis, cytokine release, and the upregulation of proinflammatory proteins. Overexpression of DUOX1 resulted in opposite effects of knockdown DUOX1. Administration of an ROS scavenger blocked the effect of DUOX1 overexpression. Supplementation of IL-1β and IL-18 caused significant fibrosis in human cardiac fibroblasts (hCFs). The knockdown of DUOX1 protected cardiomyocytes against activin A-induced fibrosis via the inhibition of ROS, cytokine release, and pyroptosis.

Abstract: This study investigates experimentally the impact of droplets on the performance of solar photovoltaic (PV) cells due to dropwise condensation or rain falling on their cover. Dew formation occurs frequently in various climates including in semi-arid regions suitable to PV cell deployment. Then, droplets present on the cover of solar cells can negatively affect the cell power generation and efficiency due to optical effects. Here, semi-transparent glass covers were prepared without or with surface treatments and covered with acrylic droplets with contact angle ranging between 25° and 77° and surface area coverage between 19% and 49%. The current vs. voltage curves of commercial polycrystalline silicon solar cells with dry and droplet-covered glass covers were measured under simulated solar irradiation at incidence angle varying between 0° and 85°. For incident angles θi ≤ 30°, the droplets did not affect the performance of the PV cells. However, for incident angles θi > 30°, the presence of droplets caused the maximum power and energy conversion efficiency of the PV cells to decrease significantly, particularly for large droplet contact angle and/or surface area coverage. Such performance degradation was attributed to the fact that the incident light was back-scattered through the droplets instead of being trapped by total internal reflection at the cover/air interface before being eventually absorbed by the solar cell. The study also shows that the hourly energy production of PV cells can decrease significantly with dew formation, based on actual weather conditions. These results highlight the importance of selecting durable hydrophilic solar cell cover.

Apolipoprotein H drives hepatitis B surface antigen retention and endoplasmic reticulum stress during hepatitis B virus infection,

Abstract: Background
Apolipoprotein H (APOH), also known as beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI), is an acute phase protein in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and binds to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) with high-affinity. APOH expression is upregulated by HBV and the large surface protein (LHBs), but also elevated in HBV-related hepatoma cells. Previous studies show that intracellular retention of HBsAg induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a key driver of hepatocyte damage during chronic liver injury, but the mechanisms are unclear. We hypothesize that APOH mediates HBV-induced ER stress through increased retention of HBsAg.
Methods
VR-APOH-myc and VR-LHBs-flag plasmids were constructed by PCR using pcDNA3.1(-)-APOH or an HBV expression vector, respectively. APOH and ER stress markers were examined at protein and mRNA levels by Western Blot or RT-qPCR. HBsAg titer was assayed by ELISA. RNA-seq was performed to elucidate the transcriptional impact of APOH manipulation in HBV-producing cells (HepG2.2.15 cells).
Results
We found that HBV upregulates APOH expression in 293 T cells, and APOH overexpression subsequently inhibits secretion of HBsAg. Next, we show that LHBs overexpression in conjunction with APOH leads to ER stress in 293 T cells, as evidenced by production of the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), as well as increased splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). We further observed that loss of beta2-GPI reduced CHOP expression in HepG2.2.15 cells, while beta2-GPI overexpression enhanced CHOP production.
Conclusion
The interaction of beta2-GPI and HBV initiates ER stress through driving intracellular retention of HBsAg and activates the UPR.

Abstract: The aim of the paper was to enhance the mechanical properties and anti-permeability performance of microcapsules through shell modification to keep complete and stable structure during the manufacturing process. The effect of PVA adding dosage, modified methods and types of PVA on the performance of microcapsules was discussed in detail. When the PVA/MF ratio (0.04–0.25) was appropriate, the supercooling degree of microcapsules was reduced and thermal stability was improved to some extent. Furthermore, the modified method of adding PVA-1788 into microcapsules after curing probably formed the second protective encapsulation for RTPCMs, which contributed to obtaining MicroRTPCMs-2 with excellent mechanical properties and anti-permeability performance. Compared among the effects of various types of PVA modification on the performance of MicroRTPCMs, PVA with larger polymerization degree and higher alcoholysis degree can form modified resin with larger crosslinking degree, which was beneficial to generating more stable composite shell structure. Therefore, MicroRTPCMs1-2699 presented more outstanding mechanical properties and anti-permeability performance, satisfactory cycle stability and long-term reliability, as well as reversible thermochromic coloration and leakage-prevention performance. In the end, the main characteristic of RTPCMs was to in-situ observe the heat absorption, energy storage and heat release process of PCM cores, which would be great significance for the practical application of MicroRTPCMs in the fields of thermoregulated fibers, thermal energy storage textiles, heat energy transfers and energy-saving building materials.

Abstract: The concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) system has a high potential in increasing the power output, propelling further the concentration ratio generating excessive heat that significantly deteriorates the solar cell efficiency and reliability. To thoroughly exploit graphene as a pre-illumination cooling technique for a solar cell, we experimentally characterized screen printed graphene coating (GC) physicochemical characterizations to observe the attenuation of light across a wide wavelength range with different GC thicknesses on a low iron-glass. The thermal and electrical characterizations were further executed to observe the performance of GC on a concentrated CPV system. Based on these comprehensive experimental characterizations, the concept of utilizing graphene as a neutral density (ND) filter for focal spot CPV system is shown to reduce the device temperature significantly by 20% and 12% for GC6.3 (6.3 μm thickness) and GC2.2 (2.2 μm thickness) in comparison with the infrared filter, respectively. It has been observed that GC6.3 increased the cell efficiency by about 12% at 8 suns compared to the base case at 400 W/m2 producing 7 suns. It has been ascertained that the introduction of graphene as the ND filter component improved the solar cell efficiency instead of just reducing the geometrical concentration ratio. Further, even the most susceptible single-junction solar cell under a concentration ratio of ≈20 suns with no cooling aid has shown an excellent cell efficiency. Therefore, our approach envisages its application for non-CPV and high and ultrahigh CPV system incorporated with a triple-junction solar cell eliminate the use of external heat sinks or other cooling arrangements.

Abstract: Solar-driven water evaporation is emerging as a promising strategy to utilize solar energy for the desalination and water purification. In this work, two kinds of monoliths based on hypercrosslinked polymers (HCPs) nanotubes, which were synthesized using inexpensive and conventional chemicals, i.e. benzene and methylbenzene as building blocks via Friedel-Crafts reaction, have been created as photothermal materials through a superhydrophilic modification followed by the coating of polypyrrole as light absorption layer. The as-synthesized HCPs possess large specific surface area (up to 773 m2 g-1) and low apparent density (0.011 g cm-3), which endow them very low thermal conductivity (0.029 W m-1 k-1). After modification with sodium alginate and polypyrrole, the resulting HCPs (named as PPy-M-HCPs) show surface superhydrophilicity (water contact angle ~0°), stronger light absorption (ca. 95%) and better mechanical properties. Taking advantages of these unique physicochemical properties mentioned above, the PPy-M-HCPs exhibit outstanding light-to-heat conversion performance with a high solar conversion efficiency of ca. 87% achieved under 1 kW m-2 irradiation. In addition, the PPy-M-HCPs also show excellent salt-resistant performance, e.g. a high energy conversion efficiency of more than 85% obtained in 20 wt% NaCl solution, due to their loosely porous structure coupling with their superhydrophilic wettability. Based on the merits of simple fabrication process, excellent stability and high solar conversion efficiency, the PPy-M-HCPs may have great potentials as efficient photothermal materials for real applications.

Abstract: Herein we present a comprehensive study of composition dependent Neodymium (Nd3+) doped Titania (Nd-TiO2) as photoanodes for obtaining improved performances in different types of solar energy conversion devices, namely dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), quantum-dot (QD) sensitized solar cells (QDSC) and photo-electrochemical cells (PEC). An all-inclusive characterization of the optical, dielectric properties and morphological studies of Nd-TiO2 with different doping concentration are performed. The XPS and Urbach energy analysis corroborated further by the dielectric studies established the critical role of vacancies in the improved electrical properties of doped TiO2 in comparison with that of undoped TiO2. Superior performances on solar cells devices (DSSC and QDSC) and PEC water splitting devices using N719 dye and CdS-QD sensitized Nd-TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated and analyzed. Enhanced photo-conversion efficiencies of ≈30% for QDSC and ≈16% for DSSC were obtained with Nd (0.4 mol%)-TiO2 photoanodes in comparison with undoped TiO2 photoanodes. Similarly, the PEC water splitting of CdS (QDs) sensitization exhibited the photocurrent density of (1.8 mA-cm−2 at 1.23 V vs RHE), which is three times higher than undoped TiO2, while the N719 dye-sensitized photoanode exhibited the current density of (0.7 mA-cm−2 at 1.23 V vs RHE), which is two times higher than undoped TiO2. The results established that the optimized doping concentration of Nd (0.4 mol%)-TiO2 is universal for all classes of solar energy conversion devices.

Abstract: In this work application of inkjet printing of phosphorus inks as dopant source for fabrication of silicon solar cells with tunnel oxide passivating contacts (TOPCon) was demonstrated. Inkjet printing is of great importance for the formation of selectively doped TOPCon layers of industrial TOPCon cells to provide a low contact resistance, while creating the requirements for screen printing metallization. Rheological characterizations were carried out in order to determine the complex viscosity and elastic effects of the inks. Printing processes were developed and optimized accordingly, given the significant relevance of rheology in inkjet printing. It was realized that inkjet printing processes have a direct influence on the electrical properties of passivating contacts. Droplets with a diameter of below 35 μm and lines with sharp edges and width of down to 70 μm were obtained. Excellent passivation quality was achieved for inkjet-printed n-type poly-Si surfaces with an implied open-circuit voltage of iVoc = 733 mV and an implied fill factor of iFF = 86.4%. For n-type passivating contacts, doped by inks containing phosphorus, the junction characteristics were investigated using double-sided contacted silicon solar cells. With these cells, Voc = 703 mV, FF = 72 %, and conversion efficiency of η = 17.1 % were realized. For ion-implanted poly-Si surfaces, herein used as reference, η = 18.2 % was obtained, underlining the high potential of investigated inkjet printing processes.

Abstract: In this report, we demonstrate composite hydrogels obtained from BiVO4 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (BiVO4-rGO) for enhanced solar-driven steam generation and decontamination of polluted water. The BiVO4-rGO composite hydrogel is obtained via a facile yet effective hydrothermal reduction of graphene oxide with the presence of the BiVO4 nanoparticles. We show that with the composite hydrogel floating on the water surface, an evaporative rate of ~1.6 kg/m2 h and solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 87% under 1 sun illumination can be achieved, which can be attributed to the highly porous structures and the interfacial heating characteristics. Additionally, when simulated polluted water is used as the source water for the freshwater production, the BiVO4-rGO composite hydrogel also exhibits an outstanding photo-decontamination performance of the toxic organic dyes in the underlying source water, such as rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO). We anticipate that this multifunctional BiVO4-rGO hydrogel could be promising in the freshwater generation and decontamination of polluted water and will contribute to sustainable development.

Abstract: In this study, the effects of using different heat transfer fluids on the energy and exergy efficiencies of a new indirect solar cooker are experimentally investigated. The studied heat transfer fluids are thermal oil and three thermal oil-based nanofluids including SiO2-oil, TiO2-oil, and SiC-oil with 0.5 wt%. In this research, the performance of the solar collector and cooking unit, as the two main sections of the indirect solar cooker, is also evaluated from the energy and exergy viewpoints. Based on the results, using the nanofluids in the indirect solar cooker improves the energy and exergy outputs as well as the energy and exergy efficiencies compared to those of the system with thermal oil. Moreover, among the studied cases, the solar cooker with SiC-oil nanofluid has a superior performance. The results reveal that using SiC-oil nanofluid instead of thermal oil in the indirect solar cooker decreases the time taken to boil 2 L of water about 17 min (23.29%). The use of SiO2-oil, TiO2-oil, and SiC-oil nanofluids in the system enhances the overall energy efficiency of the solar cooker by 1.17, 3.54, and 4.27% points compared to that of thermal oil, respectively.

Abstract: Long-lived electrochromic devices (ECDs) with multilevel bistability based on a portable film-type polymer electrolyte (PFPE) were fabricated and their optical and electrical properties were characterized. WO3 and NiOx, deposited via a vacuum method, were used as electrochromic materials, and PFPEs were assembled in ECDs by a transfer method. The PFPEs were fabricated by inserting a polyvinyl acetal (PVA) based gel electrolyte between a light and a tight release films. The PFPE-based ECD operated reliably for at least 109,000 cycles and showed excellent bistability in multilevel open circuits. For 30 min after removing the applied operating voltage, the ECD maintained 90% and 99% of the original coloration and decoloration transmittance at 550 nm, respectively. The average coloration and decoloration consumed charge and efficiency over 109,000 operation cycles were 4.2 and −4.5 mC/cm2 and 81.4 and −74.8 cm2/C, respectively.

Abstract: Even though subclasses of macrophage have distinct roles during progression of infectious diseases, it remains poorly understood whether there is a subset-specific difference in drug responses. Here, we report that ABCG2 was expressed specifically in M2-like macrophages and that it controlled their efflux activities. Abcg2 expression is markedly induced during polarization of PMA-primed macrophages toward an M2 type. IL-4 and IL-13 induced Pparg expression through STAT6 and PPARγ in turn acted on the Abcg2 promoter for its transcription activation. Once polarized to M2-like macrophages, these cells had sustained PPARγ transcription activation of Abcg2 gene. Accordingly, interruption of this machinery by T0070907, an inverse agonist of PPARγ, was shown to be effective in Abcg2 downregulation and its efflux activity in M2-like macrophages. Taken together, our results implicate that ABCG2 of M2 macrophages may function as an important pump that plays a potential role in drug efflux and that T0070907 may be used to increase the efficacy of M2 macrophage-targeting drugs such as antibiotics.

Abstract: Electrospun phase change fiber (PCF) releases more than 85 wt% of organic solvents yet suffers from long-term thermal cycling-induced leakage. In this contribution, a novel PEG/PVA composite PCF was obtained by electrospinning their aqueous solution instead of using organic solvent in traditional method, which makes design of PCF towards green and cost-effective direction. Meanwhile, a simple surface crosslinking technology was applied to prevent leakage of PEG during the long-term service, and improve the thermal stability and tensile strength of the obtained crosslinked PCF (CPCF). The CPCF-50 shows the optimal morphological structure and exhibits the a relative high latent heat of 72.3 J/g. Owing to the confinement effect, CPCF exhibits robust thermal, chemical, and morphological stability with respect to 1000 thermal cycling. The CPCF also shows exceptional temperature regulation capability. The thermoregualting times of heating and freezing processes of CPCF-50 are 59.0% and 89.5% longer than those of the control and CPCF-0, respectively. Therefore, the eco-friendly and cost-effective prepared CPCF in this work, which exhibits relatively high latent heat and long-term reliability, paves a new way for the large-scale production of phase change fiber for thermal energy storage application.

Abstract: Surface texturing of a silicon solar cell is critical to provide surface antireflection and light trapping. The common texturing method based on KOH as an etchant with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as a wetting agent suffers two disadvantages: introducing metal contamination and low repeatability. To circumvent the limitation of the KOH-IPA method, we develop a new texturing regime by substituting TMAH for KOH, and a commercial surfactant RENA monoTEX for IPA. This TMAH-monoTEX method shows advantages of non-metal contamination, high reproducibility, short process time and small random pyramids. IBC solar cells fabricated with the TMAH-monoTEX texture achieved an efficiency of 25% with Jsc of 42.9 mA/cm2, Voc of 719 mV and FF of 81.1%.

Abstract: Antimony sulphide (Sb2S3) thin films have attracted considerable research interest as a photovoltaic absorber material owing to their suitable band gap, large absorption coefficient, and excellent photoelectronic properties. In this study, cadmium sulphide (CdS) films were doped with potassium, which increased their crystallinity and optical transmission. These films were then used as a buffer layer to increase the efficiency of Sb2S3 solar cells. Furthermore, the potassium diffused into the Sb2S3 film, which increased their crystallinity and light absorption and decreased its surface roughness. Dual-functional potassium doping helped improve all of the photoelectric parameters of the Sb2S3 solar cells. Specifically, the device efficiency increased from 4.57% to 6.53% (an increase of 42.89%), and a high current density of 15.29 mA cm−2 was achieved. These findings are expected to facilitate the further development of Sb2S3 thin-film solar cells for industrial applications.

Abstract: An effective encapsulation solution for flexible CIGS is urgently needed to ensure a competitive market entry of the technology. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility to effectively encapsulate module-level (10 × 10 cm2) CIGS/glass solar cells by employing a thin Al2O3 barrier layer grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). As determined by a direct methodology, 10 nm ALD-Al2O3 is proved to be sufficient in preventing electrical degradation of the Al:ZnO (AZO) window layer upon exposure to damp heat test (DHT) and equally effective to encapsulate 10 × 10 cm2 CIGS/glass mini-modules by efficient blockage of moisture ingress. CIGS mini-modules encapsulated by ALD-Al2O3 barrier layer retain an average of 80% and 72% of initial efficiency after 1000 and 2000 h of DHT, respectively. Whereas unencapsulated modules drop to an average of 67% (1000 h DHT) and 22% (2000 h DHT) of initial efficiency. Thanks to the presence of ALD-Al2O3 barrier layer, less electrical degradation occurred in AZO window layer and P3 interconnection; also less shunting paths appeared – both led to a lower FF drop in encapsulated CIGS mini-modules. However, an issue of Na migration out of the CIGS layer is observed, which negatively impacts the module stability during DHT.

Abstract: The present study investigates the triggering and acceleration of xylitol crystallization for its use as a short-term TES. The combined effect of seeding and the action of shear on xylitol crystallization at a supercooled temperature has been investigated by direct observations under shear (rheo-optical approach) and by rheometry. The initial seed is an agglomerate of crystals of xylitol. In addition to the more classical erosion and rupture mechanisms leading to the dispersion of crystals, shear has shown to induce the detachment of crystalline dust adhered to the initial seed into the supercooled xylitol. These crystal fragments then serve as sites for secondary nucleation and subsequent crystallization. Rheo-optical observations have allowed the determination of shear conditions to control the size of crystals by dispersion. A second part has been dedicated to the effect of shear on crystallization of xylitol by seeding by means of rheology. The measurements, although not reproducible, clearly show that seeding in presence of shear (for the investigated conditions) is very efficient to trigger and accelerate the crystallization of xylitol. Post-mortem DSC and XRPD analyses of the final crystallized seeded and sheared samples have not shown any effect on the xylitol crystallinity degree.

Abstract: Nanofluids based on molten salts have been recently studied thanks to the increase in some thermophysical properties compared to the base salt. Despite the interest shown in such material, information on its stability over time and viscosity is lacking, especially when Hitec is used as the base salt. This research evaluated for the first time at high temperature, the particle/agglomeration size, colloidal stability, as well as the rheological behavior of Hitec salt-based alumina nanofluids containing 0.5–1.5 wt% of alumina nanoparticles with a 13.6 nm nominal size. The results showed intermediate particle size and stability values, and that its nanofluid character (nanoparticles < 100 nm) remained after 1 h under static conditions and mechanical redispersion. The relation between the viscosity and temperature of pure Hitec followed the Guzmán-Andrade and Girifalco models and was compared to the correlations in the literature. Hitec and molten salt-based nanofluids (MSBNFs) with 0.5 wt% of Al2O3 displayed Newtonian behavior both with a rheological behavior index n = 1, while the other MSBNFs presented shear-thinning behavior with n = 0.827 and n = 0.743 for 1.0 and 1.5 wt% of Al2O3, respectively. This behavior is in accordance with the particle sizes analyzed using the Dynamic Light Scattering, the sample with the smallest initial size presented a Newtonian behavior compared to the other samples whose size was larger and therefore its behavior was shear-thinning. Finally, the experimental influence of the nanoparticle concentration on viscosity was compared to theoretical and empirical models. The Chandrasekar model was determined to provide the best experimental data fitting.

Abstract: In this contribution, we present an electron selective passivating contact metallised with a low temperature process to target front side applications in crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. In addition to an interfacial silicon oxide (SiOx) and an in-situ phosphorous doped micro-crystalline silicon (μc-Si(n)) layer, it comprises an ultra-thin indium tin oxide (ITO) layer of 15 nm for lateral conductivity and a hydrogen rich silicon nitride (SiNx:H) layer which serves as hydrogen (H) reservoir and as anti-reflection coating. We use one single thermal treatment for 30 min at 350 °C to sinter the screen-printed paste, to recover sputtering damage induced during ITO deposition, and to diffuse hydrogen from the SiNx:H layer towards the c-Si/SiOx interface where it passivates interfacial defects. Applied to symmetrically processed textured samples, we find implied open-circuit voltage (iVOC) > 728 mV for optimal ITO thickness of 15 nm and annealing temperatures of 350 °C. The developed stack was applied on the front textured side of co-annealed (800 °C) p-type c-Si solar cells in combination with a tunnel oxide hole selective passivating contact on the rear side. We demonstrate solar cells with fill factor (FF) up to 81.9% and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) up to 719 mV. With a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 38.6 mA/cm2, we obtain a final cell efficiency to 22.8%. We find that the annealing of the SiNx:H/ITO stack strongly increases the ITO free carrier density penalizing the solar cell spectral response at high wavelengths.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated reactive diffusion at the interface between a Cu back electrode and a ZnSnP2 absorber, at which ohmic behavior was previously confirmed by appropriate annealing. Cross-sectional observation of the Cu/ZnSnP2 interface revealed that Cu3P was formed along the ZnSnP2 surface after annealing. It was also found that Cu3P was epitaxially formed beside ZnSnP2 with a lattice-mismatch of less than 0.5% by electron diffraction around the Cu3P/ZnSnP2 interface and consideration of atomic arrangements, particularly the phosphorus sublattice, in both phosphides. In addition, photoelectron yield spectroscopy revealed that the work function of Cu3P and ionization potential of ZnSnP2 are both about 5.2 eV, suggesting that the potential barrier against hole transport is small at the Cu3P/ZnSnP2 interface. The formation of Cu3P at the interface leads to higher current density and no roll-over of J-V curves in ZnSnP2 solar cells. Consequently, the highest efficiency of ZnSnP2 solar cells of 3.87% was achieved by intentionally prepared Cu3P using sputtering. It is concluded that Cu3P is a promising back buffer material for ZnSnP2 solar cells due to the alignment with ZnSnP2 from the viewpoints of band and lattice structures.

Abstract: We explored the utility of ground-based highly accelerated life testing (HALT) on triple-junction coverglass interconnected cells (CICs) after exposure to Mars dust storm conditions. The CICs comprised the triple junction solar cells, a silicone encapsulant bonded to ceria-doped coverglass with an antireflection coating. These CICs were placed in an enclosure and sandblasted with Mars dust simulant to replicate dust impingement. We compared the apparatus properties with measured Martian dust storm parameters from Viking landers. We found that simulated Martian dust storms often result in increased reflectance and decreased absorption at visible wavelengths and subsequent reduced short circuit current (JSC). Reduction in the open circuit voltage (VOC) is observed in select cases, caused by structural damage after CIC fracture. We found that even if there is no observable VOC losses, minority carrier lifetime is reduced. The JSC tends to rebound upon cleaning, suggesting current losses are reversible and unrelated to permanent damage such as cell cracking and subsequent isolation of regions of the cell due to broken busbars. This observation indicates a quantifiable difference between recoverable and non-recoverable power loss, suggesting a permanent degradation could be determined. We compared experimental data to mined field data from the Mars Exploration Rover, Opportunity and extracted a degradation rate. We found exceptional agreement between the irreversible degradation in our laboratory experiments and 4.9 Martian years of mined field data, 9.7% and 9.4% respectively, demonstrating that the laboratory method well represents the physical reality of solar cells’ exposure to the Martian environment.

Abstract: Photon management is an efficient route to ameliorate optical issues for improving the efficiency of solar cells. On account of reflection loss and spectral mismatch for silicon solar cells, we herein firstly demonstrate a photon management of combining antireflection and luminescence down-shifting coatings to simultaneously suppress the reflection of incident light with nanoporous structure and improve the spectra response of silicon solar cells in short wavelength with in-situ fabricated perovskite quantum dots composite film. Antireflection film can be obtained by sacrificing CdxZn1-xSeyS1-y/ZnS quantum dots template in PDMS composite film, which can bring 9.7% improvement in photocurrent for amorphous silicon solar cells. By further combining perovskite quantum dots down-shifting luminescence coating, an absolute improvement of 1.05% in power conversion efficiency was achieved. The photon management combining the antireflection and luminescence down-shifting coatings could provide a low-cost, simple but effective way to address the optical issues and improve the device performance of optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Monoclinic VO2 (M) displays thermochromic properties based on its reversible metal-insulator transition. We studied the kinetics of the underlying structural phase transition (SPT) from monoclinic VO2 (M) to rutile VO2 (R) and vice versa both in powders and coatings, using isoconversional kinetic analysis based on datasets obtained through differential scanning calorimetry and UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometry. For VO2 powders, prepared via solution-phase reduction of V2O5 with oxalic acid and subsequent thermal anneal, we show that the activation energy |Ea| of the SPT is temperature dependent, and decreases with increasing difference between the material's temperature and the critical switching temperature T0. |Ea| for both VO2 (M) to VO2 (R) and VO2 (R) to VO2 (M) is similar, and ranges between 138 and 563 kJ mol−1, depending on the temperature of the material. This indicates that similar defects play a key role in both SPTs. Upon doping with tungsten, T0 was lowered from 66.93 °C (0 at. % W) to −28.38 °C (3.5 at. % W). |Ea|, however, remained in the same range. Nonetheless, at W concentrations above 2 at. % a significant asymmetry was observed with higher |Ea| for the switch from VO2 (R) to VO2 (M). The SPT of VO2 (M) in coatings proceeded 4 times slower. This may result from the immobilization of the VO2 domains on the substrate surface and within the coating network, making the SPT more difficult to progress. The findings of this study have important implications for the application of VO2 (M) in energy efficient thermochromic glazing.

Abstract: Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, CCN2) is a matricellular protein which plays key roles in normal mammalian development and in tissue homeostasis and repair. In pathological conditions, dysregulated CCN2 has been associated with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and tissue fibrosis. In this study, genetic manipulation of the CCN2 gene was employed to investigate the role of CCN2 expression in vitro and in experimentally-induced models of pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Knocking down CCN2 using siRNA reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers (fibronectin p < 0.01, collagen type I p < 0.05, α-SMA p < 0.0001, TIMP-1 p < 0.05 and IL-6 p < 0.05) in TGF-β-treated lung fibroblasts derived from systemic sclerosis patients. In vivo studies were performed in mice using a conditional gene deletion strategy targeting CCN2 in a fibroblast-specific and time-dependent manner in two models of lung disease. CCN2 deletion significantly reduced pulmonary interstitial scarring and fibrosis following bleomycin-instillation, as assessed by fibrotic scores (wildtype bleomycin 3.733 ± 0.2667 vs CCN2 knockout (KO) bleomycin 4.917 ± 0.3436, p < 0.05) and micro-CT. In the well-established chronic hypoxia/Sugen model of pulmonary hypertension, CCN2 gene deletion resulted in a significant decrease in pulmonary vessel remodelling, less right ventricular hypertrophy and a reduction in the haemodynamic measurements characteristic of PAH (RVSP and RV/LV + S were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in CCN2 KO compared to WT mice in hypoxic/SU5416 conditions). These results support a prominent role for CCN2 in pulmonary fibrosis and in vessel remodelling associated with PAH. Therefore, therapeutics aimed at blocking CCN2 function are likely to benefit several forms of severe lung disease.

Abstract: The present study investigated whether TGF-β1 promotes fibrotic changes in HK-2 cells through the Activin A and STAT3 signaling pathways in vitro. Bioinformatics analysis of microarray profiles (GSE20247 and GSE23338) and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis were performed to select hub genes. For the in vitro study, HK-2 cells were exposed to TGF-β1. The expression of Activin A and STAT3 was assayed, and the effect of Activin A and STAT3 expression on fibrosis was assessed (Collagen I and Fibronectin). The bioinformatics study revealed TGF-β1 and Activin A as hub genes. The in vitro study showed that Activin A expression was significantly increased after TGF-β1 incubation. Blocking Activin A attenuated TGF-β1-induced fibrosis. In addition, Activin A blockade attenuated TGF-β1-induced STAT3 signaling pathway activation and related fibrosis. More importantly, STAT3 inhibition by S3I-201 alleviated TGF-β1-induced fibrosis. Activin A promoted cellular fibrotic changes through the STAT3 signaling pathway. Attenuating Activin A expression to mediate the STAT3 signaling pathway might be a strategy for potent renal fibrosis treatment.

Abstract: A Janus solar evaporator with 2D water path has been built by covering the hydrophobic soot-coated cloth/hydrophilic cloth bilayer on hydrophobic polyethylene (PE)-wrapped cellulose aerogel. Such a unique structure not only minimizes the heat conduction loss compared to the typical flat Janus structure in the direct contact mode, but also has a much better salt-resisting ability than common hydrophilic solar evaporator with 2D water channel. By using candle soot (CS) as light harvester, the obtained solar evaporator (SE-CS) was demonstrated to strongly resist salt deposition and efficiently generate steam from 3.5 to 20 wt% NaCl solution under 1.0 sun illumination. Furthermore, SE-CS could be used to produce steam from methyl orange (MO) solution (0.01 M) and heavy metal solution (Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ with concentration of 1000 mg L−1). In addition to CS, kerosene soot (KS) could also promote the efficient steam generation from 3.5 wt% NaCl solution over the obtained solar evaporator (SE-KS) under 1.0 sun irradiation. This work paves the way for practical application of solar-driven evaporation in seawater desalination and wastewater purification.

Abstract: The concentrated solar energy which is one of the renewable energy sources, is examined in metal melting which requires high temperatures. The study is carried out for the first time in an environment where total solar radiation of 1394 kWh m−2-year and sunshine duration of 2132 h-year at the sea level in Trabzon province at 41° latitudes and 39° longitudes. In the present work, a single concentrator model of solar furnace system is presented. Parabolic dish with a diameter of 1.42 m was used for the first time with high reflection rate chromium nickel foil in the concentration of the solar rays. To store the concentrated solar beams, a metal melting furnace is designed, manufactured and tested. Total heat loss analysis of the furnace according to measured experimental values is performed for the designed solar furnace. The melting process of the aluminum metal was realized in the furnace. In the experiment, the efficiency of the system was calculated based on the measured temperatures and solar radiations. The system efficiency which consists of the parabolic solar concentrator and the solar furnace was found to be approximately 46% at the average focal temperature of 1023 K. In the melting process, the efficiency of the furnace is calculated as the ratio of stored energy to the absorbed solar energy on the surface. The total thermal efficiency 22% is calculated for the first time in the aluminum melting process and mass flow rate is 0,0667 g s−1 at this time.

Abstract: This study synthesized robust and sustainable microcapsules of NaNO3 salt for harnessing solar thermal energy. The NaNO3 salt was encapsulated into SiO2 shells without the use of surfactants using a sol-gel process. The effects of the concentrations of precursor and catalyst, along with the synthesis time duration, were investigated to determine the optimal synthesis protocol for the solid NaNO3@SiO2 microcapsules. The morphological characteristics, including the shell structures of the NaNO3@SiO2 microcapsules, were examined using scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the elemental analysis was performed using Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry to prove the existence of the core and shell materials in the synthesized microcapsules. In addition, based on the thermal properties of the synthesized microcapsules as measured experimentally using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the encapsulation ratio and encapsulation efficiency were evaluated quantitatively. A high encapsulation ratio (85.8%) and a high encapsulation efficiency (87.4%) were achieved under the optimal synthesis protocol suggested in this study. The heat storage capacity of the microcapsules was estimated as the temperature increased from 250 to 350 °C and compared to that of the solar salts. The outstanding thermal reliability and stability of the NaNO3@SiO2 microcapsules were determined based on repeated heating and cooling cycles in the DSC measurements. Additionally, their long-lasting heating capabilities (up to 12 h at 350 °C) were confirmed, providing options for their use in solar thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: In order to produce a step forward towards the monolithic integration of III-V and IV compounds in multijunction solar cells, a first assessment of SiGeSn deposition in a metal organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE) chamber also used for III-V growth has been carried out. The study brings insights on several aspects of the MOVPE SiGeSn growth in order to get a better control of SiGeSn composition and to obtain epitaxial layers with improved morphology. In particular, it is shown that the gas source Si2H6 is more influenced by the growth temperature compared to GeH4 and SnCl4, moreover, its competition with SnCl4 makes it difficult to incorporate Si in SiGeSn, as SnCl4 partial pressure is increased. SiGeSn morphology is shown to be strongly dependent on temperature, As carry-over and growth rate. A new growth model is introduced in order to explain the importance of the adatom bond lengths in inhibiting tin segregation when SiGeSn is grown at relatively high growth temperatures (>480 °C). In order to investigate the photovoltaic behaviour of SiGeSn, a single-junction GaAs/InGaP/SiGeSn/Ge functional device has been manufactured and characterized by external quantum efficiency (EQE) and current-voltage measurements. The experimental and the simulated EQE show the higher absorption coefficient of SiGeSn with respect to Ge, which allows using SiGeSn layers with a thickness three times lower than Ge to produce the same photovoltaic current.

Abstract: VO2 is a well-known thermochromic material that can be potentially applied as a coating on “smart” glazing systems. In this work VO2 thermochromic films, were grown by the rf sputtering technique on two different types of commercial glass substrates, namely fused silica and float glass, at the low deposition temperature of 300 °C. The optimum deposition conditions, in order to succeed the thermochromic monoclinic phase of VO2(M), were investigated and found to be subject to substrate and thickness. It was observed that on the float glass substrate, only films with thicknesses below 50 nm grown with 3% O2 in plasma exhibited a thermochromic behavior, displaying a critical transition temperature of TC = 46.1 °C, width of transmittance hysteresis loop at 2000 nm ΔTC = 9.1 °C, IR-switching ΔTrIR = 14.6%, integrated solar transmittance modulation ΔTrsol = 1.3% and integrated luminous transmittance at 25 °C equal to Trlum = 36.6%. In contrast, films deposited on fused silica glass demonstrated a thermochromic phase, for all thicknesses, when grown with 1% O2 in the plasma. These thermochromic films were characterized by much lower TC(<40 °C) and ΔTC<10 °C, along with significant thickness variations of the ΔTrIR, ΔTrsol and Trlum parameters. Finally, rapid thermal annealing (RTA) was used and found to enhance the thermochromic performance of films deposited on float glass, with thickness greater than 50 nm. These differences might be attributed to the different composition of each kind of glass, as well as to diffusion phenomena between film and substrate.

Abstract: A novel form-stable phase change material (FSPCM) based on ionic liquid/aluminum nitride/copolyamide composite were fabricated from electrospinning approach. The ionic liquid 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (IL) was chosen as phase change materials while nano aluminum nitride (AlN) and copolyamide 6/12 (CoPA) were chesen as additive and supporting matrix, respectively. The surface morphology and heat storage property had been systematically investigated by Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), respectively. Results showed that the diameter of the phase change fibers are 0.92–1.07 μm and was influenced by the IL and AlN content. With 57 wt% of IL and 5 wt% of AlN, the composite fiber achieved a fusion enthalpy of 86.4 J/g and the thermal conductivity was increased by 165.2% compared to that of IL/CoPA. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and thermal cycle test also indicated a good thermal stability and reusability of the composite fiber. Furthermore, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses indicated that new hydrogen bonds between IL and CoPA were formed in the composite and showed a significant effect on the thermal performance of the composite fibers. The electrospun composite fiber based on ionic liquids can be applied as form-stable phase change material in thermal energy storage and temperature regulation.

Abstract: Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) passivating contacts are promising technologies to promote the efficiency of silicon solar cells, due to their low carrier recombination and low contact resistivity. In this work, we present phosphorus spin-on doping as an alternative doping method to fabricate high performance poly-Si passivating contacts. The influences of thermal treatments and intrinsic amorphous Si thickness on poly-Si passivating contact quality were investigated. A high implied open-circuit voltage of above 730 mV together with a low contact resistivity below 4 mΩ⋅cm2 were obtained for 100 – 230 nm thick poly-Si layers after a thermal treatment at 975 °C for 60 min followed by a forming gas annealing. The promising results presented in this work imply that phosphorus spin-on doping can be an effective doping method alternative to conventional POCl3 diffusion.

Abstract: In this work, form-stable phase change composites (PCCs) with high thermal conductivity and adjustable thermal management capacity are prepared based on phase change microcapsules (SiO2@SA) and surface-modified boron nitride (m-BN). The phase change properties are successfully infused into PCCs through the incorporation of microcapsules and the thermal conductivity can be elevated up to 0.506 Wm-1K-1. Furthermore, the phase change enthalpies of PCCs can be facilely tailored from 3.74 J/g to 18.52 J/g by changing the loading fraction of microcapsule, enabling adjustable thermal energy storage and thermal management ability. PCCs are proved to possess outstanding long-term stability even after 500 cycles of charging-discharging. Besides, practical application of PCCs as thermal regulating materials is explored through a self-designed temperature control system. Finally, the PCCs exhibit good leakage proof property at 100 °C due to the shielding effect of SiO2 shell. These results show that this work offers a promising strategy for the development of advanced form-stable PCCs with good comprehensive properties.

Abstract: Prognostic factors associated with clinical outcomes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement are unknown. We retrospectively studied the characteristics and outcomes of 66 (18 pediatric and 48 adult) patients with CNS leukemia with ALL (n = 41) or AML (n = 25). The median age of patients at diagnosis of CNS leukemia was 30 (range, 1–69) years. Nearly two-third patients had CNS involvement at the initial diagnosis of leukemia. Complete remission of CNS leukemia was attained in 58 (88%) patients, and probability of overall survival at 36 months after the diagnosis of CNS leukemia was 43% for the entire cohort. We identified that achieving remission of systemic leukemia and having CNS leukemia diagnosed and treated before allogeneic transplantation were the factors associated with CNS leukemia remission. Prognostic factors associated with better overall survival in patients with CNS leukemia included pediatric age, diagnosis of CNS leukemia before receiving allogenic transplantation, achieving clearance of systemic or CNS leukemia, receiving no cranial radiation in conjunction with intrathecal chemotherapy (IT), and receiving IT consolidation after achieving remission of CNS leukemia. Our findings show that patients with CNS leukemia are at considerable risk of mortality. Awareness of modifiable prognostic factors such as avoidance of cranial radiation whenever possible and use of IT consolidation can result in improved outcomes in subset of patients with CNS leukemia.

Abstract: Solution-synthesized copper nanowires (CuNWs) have been proposed to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) as transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) due to the abundance of Cu and low production cost. However, there has to date been no way to simultaneously improve the transparency, conductivity, adhesiveness, chemical and thermal stabilities of CuNWs that critically limit their applications. In this work, we introduce a Sb doped SnO2 (ATO) covering layer to simultaneously improve the performances of CuNWs on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. The CuNWs form a random percolating network protected by ATO layer. The unique structural features of our ATO/CuNWs composite films allow for a novel TCE with outstanding conductivity (sheet resistance: 9.6 Ω/sq), high transmittance (>85% at 550 nm), strong adhesiveness, unprecedented excellent chemical and thermal stability, as well as flexibility, these performances are far superior to other CuNW based TCEs and comparable with the expensive silver NW based TCEs. Moreover, the composites show a good stability to resist long-term storage, flushing damage, and ultrasonication. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) using ATO/CuNWs based TCEs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.39%, which is higher than that of PSCs using ITO (5.87%), which illustrate a promising alternative to traditional TCEs for flexible electronic devices.

Abstract: We report the design, fabrication and outdoor characterization of a tandem luminescent solar concentrator/Si multi-junction photovoltaic module. Our tandem LSC/Si device consists of an InGaP LSC functioning as a top cell and a passivated contact Si bottom cell. The LSC comprises of an InGaP microcell array coupled to a polymer waveguide, loaded with CdSe/CdS core-shell quantum dot luminophores. The light trapping efficiency of the LSC waveguide is enhanced by encapsulation with photoluminescence trapping mirrors consisting of dielectric multilayer thin films. We demonstrate the performance of the LSC/Si device through a series of outdoor tests under various irradiance conditions conducted at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. We report the first outdoor testing data of an LSC/Si tandem module, displaying maintained performance across varied diffusivity conditions for the LSC component. Finally, we model the tandem module performance using a ray optic simulation-based multiphysics model and forecast a pathway for high efficiency tandem LSC/Si module performance.

Abstract: Background
Protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is an enzyme capable of converting arginine (positively charged residue) into citrulline (neutral residue). PAD4 is a promiscuous enzyme since it citrullinates various substrates, including small peptides, large proteins and itself. The effect of autocitrullination on PAD4 activity remains controversial and inconclusive. We hypothesized that PAD4 autocitrullination may influence the activity of PAD4 by indirectly altering its binding to substrate.
Methods
We employed mass spectrometry analysis to study the process of autocitrullination. The kinetics of citrullination of PAD4 and citrullinated PAD4 (citPAD4) towards substrates of different sizes (0.17–15.4 kDa), i.e. free arginine, a peptidyl substrate, and histone H3, were studied by colorimetric assay and Western blotting. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate structural dynamic and binding properties of PAD4/citPAD4 in the absence and presence of substrates.
Results
We observed that 23/27 arginine residues in PAD4 (85 %) can be citrullinated, including R372, R374 and R639 located near the substrate binding pocket. PAD4 and citPAD4 expressed comparable enzymatic activities towards different substrates. In agreement with experimental results, MD simulations indicated that autocitrullination does not change the shape of the substrate binding pocket and PAD4/citPAD4 exhibited comparable binding free energy with a H3-derived peptidyl substrate (6-TARKS-10).
Conclusion
While the effect of autocitrullination on PAD4 activity thus far remained unclear and controversial, here we have demonstrated that autocitrullination does not affect the activity of PAD4. Thus, the regulation of PAD4 activity is probably not controlled by autocitrullination but likely by other mechanisms that need further investigation.

Abstract: The origin of the hysteresis in the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is one of the most debated topics of recent years. Hysteretic effects are connected with the slow redistribution of ionic defects during the voltage sweep. Existing literature focuses on the potential screening due to accumulated ions, solely, while neglecting the possibility of charge trapping and subsequent recombination via ions. We investigate the role of cation-mediated recombination of ions using time-dependent drift–diffusion simulations in MAPbI3 PSCs. Slow-moving cations are considered as traps for the electrons. Trapped electrons can subsequently recombine non-radiatively with holes. We analyze the role of the cation-mediated trapping and its parameters (capture coefficient, cation energy, ion mobility) as well as the scan rate on the device performance. For shallow cation energies, a decrease in open-circuit voltage and slight enhancement in hysteresis is observed. Deep cation energies lead to a substantial deterioration of device performance and large hysteresis enhancement. The presented study emphasizes the importance of considering the interaction of ions with charge carriers beyond the simple electrostatic models to improve our understanding of PSCs.

Abstract: Tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) is a member of TIPE/TNFAIP8 family, has been involved in the development and progression of various human cancers. We hypothesized that TNFAIP8 promotes prostate cancer (PCa) progression via regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. Ectopic expression of TNFAIP8 increased PCa cell proliferation/migration/spheroid formation by enhancing cell metabolic activities. Mechanistically, TNFAIP8 activated the PI3K-AKT pathway and up-regulated PCa cell survival. TNFAIP8 was also found to regulate the expression of glucose metabolizing enzymes, enhancing glucose consumption, and endogenous ATP production. Treatment with a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), reduced TNFAIP8 mediated glucose consumption, ATP production, spheroid formation, and PCa cell migration. By maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, TNFAIP8 increased OXPHOS and glycolysis. Moreover, TNFAIP8 modulates the production of glycolytic metabolites in PCa cells. Collectively, our data suggest that TNFAIP8 exerts its oncogenic effects by enhancing glucose metabolism and by facilitating metabolic reprogramming in PCa cells. Therefore, TNFAIP8 may be a biomarker associated with prostate cancer and indicate a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Metal oxide charge carrier transporting materials have been incorporated in many ways in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because of their excellent chemical stability, wide band gaps, and reasonable mobilities. Herein, we report a low-temperature solution-processed intercalation method for introducing metal oxides displaying bipolar transporting capability into PSCs. We intercalated p-type nickel oxide (NiO) with cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) to function as hole and electron transport layers for inverted (p–i–n) and conventional planar (n–i–p) PSCs, respectively. When compared with the corresponding NiO-only hole transporting layer, the Cs2CO3-intercalated NiO layer displayed enhanced electron extraction without sacrificing its hole extraction capability. The power conversion efficiencies of the inverted and conventional planar PSCs reached as high as 12.08 and 13.98%, respectively. This approach not only realizes the bipolar extraction capacity of Cs2CO3-intercalated p-type metal oxides but also opens up a possible route for preparing interconnecting layers for tandem optoelectronics.

Relapse is the most common cause of treatment failure after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). No standard of care exists, and a wide range of treatments are used for post-alloHCT relapse. In the recent era, several novel therapies including targeted agents are available for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Methods
We reviewed outcomes after alloHCT relapse, with or without use of these newer agents for ALL, AML, and MDS. In total, 115 adults with relapsed or refractory ALL (n = 17), AML (n = 67), and MDS (n = 31) at median 5 (range, 1–64) months after their first alloHCT in 2010–2018 were included.
Results
Median follow-up was 19 (range, 6–80) months after relapse from alloHCT. Targeted agents were given to 29 (25%) patients. In multivariable analysis, use of targeted agent at any time point after relapse was not associated with survival. Matched unrelated (vs. matched sibling; hazard ratio [HR] 1.70; p = .027) or haploidentical donor grafts (vs. matched sibling; HR 2.69; p = .003), presence of grade II–IV acute graft-versus-host disease before relapse (HR 2.46; p < .001), and less than 12 months from HCT to relapse (<6 vs. > 12 months; HR 6.34; p < .001; 6–12 vs. > 12 months; HR 3.16; p = .005) were adverse prognostic factors for post-relapse survival.
Conclusion
Outcomes after alloHCT relapse remain poor regardless of the novel agent use. Innovative treatment strategies are needed to improve outcomes after relapse post-alloHCT.

Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the most common type of ischemic heart diseases with a high mortality rate. Although recent advances in medical cares and therapies have increased the patient’s outcomes, but, still there is no real and effective therapeutic modality for AMI. Hence, development of novel therapeutic strategies is under focus of investigations. MSCs-based therapy has been proposed for AMI, though its efficacy is controversial yet. It is believed that MSCs exert their healing effects via secretion of growth factors/cytokines. However, these cells produce a very minute amount of the factors under normal cultivation. Here, in an attempt to improve the potential therapeutic effect of MSCs-derived conditioned medium (CM) on AMI, we transfected the cells with a recombinant plasmid encoding Hif1α-3A (a mutant form of Hif1α stable under normoxic condition), so Hif1α expression and secretion into CM (MSCs-Hif1α-CM) could be up-regulated under normoxic condition. The therapeutic potential of the MSCs-Hif1α-3A-CM was investigated in a rat model of AMI and compared to the CM harvested from non-manipulated MSCs. Our results showed that the MSCs-Hif1α-3A-CM mitigated MI-induced tissues injury, decreased fibrosis, reduced apoptosis, and limited infarct area size. These findings propose a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of AMI. However, further preclinical and clinical investigations in this regard are still needed.

Abstract: Solar water splitting based on photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells has been intensively demonstrated to be promising for hydrogen energy, but it is usually difficult for one pure PEC system to achieve overall solar-driven water splitting. To solve this problem, integrating one PEC cell with one photovoltaic (PV) cell is widely employed, however, the preparation of an unabridged PV cell and the electrical connection between them are complicated. Herein, we directly synthesized hematite (α-Fe2O3) film on the as-prepared p+n-Si micro-pyramid arrays with the modifications of SnO2 interlayer and Co-Pi catalyst overlayer, and the turn-on potential achieved a substantial decrease, which is 0.34 V smaller than the Sn-doped hematite film grown on the FTO substrate (FTO/Sn@α-Fe2O3). The influences of interlayer, overlayer and α-Fe2O3 preparation conditions are systemically investigated. Besides, we comparatively studied the FTO/Sn@α-Fe2O3 photoanode in tandem with the complete p+n-Si micro-pyramid PV cell, and observed the turn-on potential as low as 0.32 V vs. RHE. The performance improvement is ascribed to a combination of the additional photovoltage from the embedded p+n-Si junction, the enhancement both in optical absorption and surface area of α-Fe2O3 film, and the promoted collection efficiency of photogenerated carriers from the interface and surface modifications. This work fills the gap of combining α-Fe2O3 photoanode and p+n-Si junction with the aim of overall solar-driven water splitting, and provides a new route to simplify the PEC/PV tandem system.

Abstract: Synthesis and characterization of high-chain diesters have been carried out to investigate their properties for thermal energy storage applications. The synthesized compounds include diesters of octanedioic acid (suberic acid) with 1-dodecanol (lauryl alcohol), 1-tetradecanol (myristyl alcohol) and 1-hexadecanol (palmityl alcohol). While FT-IR, elemental analysis and GC-MS have been intensively used for purity control and verification, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) are the main instruments for determination of the thermal properties. Properties such as phase change temperature, enthalpy, specific heat (Cp), thermal decomposition temperatures and thermal reliability of the diesters are presented in the paper. Based on the MS data, mass fragmentation fingerprints of the compounds are also presented for chemical characterization. DSC analyses indicate that melting onset temperatures range between 37 and 55 °C and they have phase change enthalpy above 195 kJ/kg. The evaluated chemical and thermal data approve that the investigated high-chain diesters can be utilized for thermal energy storage and they can be named as phase change material (PCM) based on their phase change properties and reliability.

Abstract: Despite the predominance of solar modules with bulk crystalline silicon solar cells as a result of their high photoconversion efficiency, long-lasting durability, and low cost per electrical watt, the competitive market has elevated the necessity of thinner silicon solar cells to further reduce direct material costs. However, the tabbing and stringing process using high melting temperature soldering in the conventional fabrication method of a silicon solar module is required to alternatingly interconnect adjacent silicon solar cells, which entails significant thermomechanical stress. The lifting up-and-down motions in the layup process of serially stringed silicon solar cells also lead to an unfavourable interfacial stress between metal ribbons and silicon solar cells. Consequently, a considerably poor yield of silicon solar modules with the unbearable breakage loss of thin silicon solar cells is ascribed to such processes. Herein, an innovative solution to interconnect thin silicon solar cells through virtually no thermomechanical stress is proposed by using encapsulants pre-attached with low melting temperature metal ribbons at 139 °C, which allow the interconnection of pre-laid silicon solar cells in the course of the vacuum lamination at 160 °C. The resulting silicon solar modules exhibit a photoconversion efficiency of 19.1 ± 0.1%, which represents 99.9 ± 0.6% of the benchmark photoconversion efficiency of conventional silicon solar modules. The presented layup-only modulization succeeds in fabricating silicon solar modules with 100 μm thin silicon solar cells and it is anticipated to curtail the breakage loss of thin silicon solar cells as well as elevate fabrication productivity by simplifying the fabrication steps of silicon solar modules.

Abstract: Interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells featuring passivated contacts are promising candidates to achieve record-efficiency single-junction silicon-based solar cells. However, they usually require processes that are not amenable for industrial mass production and involve great process complexity associated with patterning and alignment. In this work, we present a novel TOPCon tunnel-IBC solar cell architecture, minimizing the complexity of patterning and alignment. By adopting a local poly-Si(n+)/poly-Si(p+)/SiOx tunnel junction, this cell architecture only requires full-area deposition of various thin-film layers and is compatible with conventional fire-through screen printing. The cell architecture is realized by sequential laser patterning steps and hence no shadow masks are needed. As a critical building block, we develop a working poly-Si(n+)/(SiOx)/poly-Si(p+)/SiOx tunnel junction with implied open-circuit voltage of 727 mV and a tunnel resistivity of 0.52 Ω cm2. We also establish the required laser patterning and damage-removal processes. Finally, we demonstrate that both the electron-selective and hole-selective regions can be contacted by conventional high-temperature fire-through screen printing, hence being compatible with industrial solar cell processing. Using realistic input parameters measured on test samples, we demonstrate by computer simulation that the proposed TOPCon tunnel-IBC cells favour IBC geometry with small pitches up to the technological limit. Corresponding full device integration is currently ongoing.

Abstract: We investigated low energy nitrogen ion implantation into the SiNx/Si interfacial layer of silicon solar cells using various energies and fluences, followed by a thermal annealing process. The low energy implanted nitrogen ions penetrated into the SiNx antireflection layer and reached the Si emitter layer. However, ions could not pass through the Ag electrode contact layer and were unable to form the contact passivation layer. A low energy nitrogen ion implanted cell showed the formation of a rich nitrogen layer in the SiNx/Si interfacial area and an increase in electrical performance. With increasing nitrogen ion implantation energy, cells were damaged and suffered decreasing efficiency compared to a reference cell. Increasing the fluence of nitrogen ions also caused a decrease in cell efficiency. After a low temperature annealing process, the cell efficiency recovered almost to the pre-implantation point of the reference cells and showed a similar recovery in their photoreflectance and quantum efficiency. The low-energy nitrogen ion implantation showed the improved cell efficiency of 17.28% for the energy of 12 keV with a fluence of 1 × 1013 cm-2.

Abstract: Background
Cancer patients, particularly those on active anticancer treatment, are reportedly at a high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and death. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 whilst on anticancer treatment in a developing country.
Methods
This is a retrospective observational study of all adult cancer patients at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan, from March 15, 2020 to July 10, 2020, diagnosed with COVID-19 within 4 weeks of receiving anticancer treatment, where a purposive sampling was performed. Cancer patients who did not receive anticancer treatment and clinical or radiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without a positive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were excluded. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality after 30 days of COVID-19 test. Data was analyzed with SPSS version 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical parameters were computed using chi-square test, keeping p value < 0.05 as significant.
Results
A total of 201 cancer patients with COVID-19 were analyzed. The median age of patients was 45 (18–78) years. Mild symptoms were present in 162 (80.6%) patients, whereas severe symptoms were present in 39 (19.4%) patients. The risk of death was statistically significant (p < .05) amongst patients with age greater than 50 years, metastatic disease, and ongoing palliative anticancer treatment. Anticancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery) received within preceding 4 weeks had no statistically significant (p > .05) impact on mortality.
Conclusions
In cancer patients with COVID-19, mortality appears to be principally driven by age, advanced stage of the disease, and palliative intent of cancer treatment. We did not identify evidence that cancer patients on chemotherapy are at significant risk of mortality from COVID-19 correlating to those not on chemotherapy.

Abstract: This study was to develop stable phase change material (PCM)-water nano-emulsions with low supercooling and low viscosity using two-surfactant mixtures by the phase inversion temperature (PIT) method. The PCM agent n-hexadecane was mixed with Brij L4 as the primary surfactant and polyethylene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PE-b-PEG), Tween 60 or Tween 80 as a co-surfactant to form stable nano-emulsions. The results showed that the droplet size, viscosity and PIT point as well as the stability of PCM nano-emulsions were strongly dependent on the combination, mass ratio and total concentration of the two surfactants. In 25% (w/w) PCM nano-emulsions, an optimum formulation was the surfactant combination of Brij L4 and Tween 60 at 6:4 mass ratio, mixed with PCM at 11:20 mass ratio. The corresponding nano-emulsion had a high stability, a small droplet size of 60 nm and desirable Newtonian fluid behaviour with a relatively low viscosity of 50 mPa s. The addition of n-octacosane as a nucleating agent was effective to reduce the emulsion supercooling, though the supercooling degree was notably increased after multiple thermal cycles. The optimized 25% PCM nano-emulsion with 2% (w/w) n-octadecane showed an excellent stability over 120 days and 300 thermal cycles with a droplet size below 80 nm, a supercooling degree of ~5 °C and a latent heat of ~50 J/g, which was very promising for further development and application as a cooling storage medium.

Abstract: Defect passivation plays an important role in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a narrow bandgap conjugated polymer with hole mobility of 3.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 is utilized as a passivation agent in the fabrication of air-prepared PSCs. Theoretical calculations complemented by Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy (FTIR) demonstrate that N, S and O atoms in the polymer can behave as Lewis bases, which interact with Pb defects in the MAPbI3 films to passivate grain boundaries (GBs) and interface defects. These interactions synergistically promote an enhancement of the crystallinity and smoothness of the films. Solar cells fabricated with the polymer passivation layer exhibit average efficiencies of 18.7%–19.6% compared to an average of 16.7% for reference devices. Unencapsulated devices retained approximately 80% of their initial efficiency following 600 h of exposure in air, compared with ~30% for reference devices. The moisture stability of the devices was also dramatically improved owing to the long hydrophobic alkyl chains within the polymer. This study demonstrates that narrow bandgap materials with tailored functionality can dramatically improve the PCE and stability of PSCs and shed light on the design of the passivants that further improve film quality and device performance.

Abstract: In this study a recently developed physics-based model to describe the performance degradation of GaAs solar cells upon electron irradiation is applied to analyze the effects of proton irradiation. For this purpose GaAs solar cells with significantly different architectures are subjected to a range of proton irradiation fluences up to 5×1012 H+/cm2. The resulting J−V and EQE characteristics of the cells are measured and compared with the simulations from the model. The model requires individual degradation constants for the SRH lifetimes and the surface recombination velocities as an input. In this study these constants were obtained from the recently determined associated constants for electron irradiation using the particles non-ionizing energy loss (NIEL) values for conversion. The good fit between the simulated and experimentally obtained results demonstrate that this is a valid approach. Moreover, it suggests that the physics based model allows for a good prediction of GaAs cell performance under particle irradiation of any kind independent of the particular cell architecture as long as the layer thicknesses and doping levels are known. In addition the applied proton irradiation levels in this study were not found to induce additional Cu-related degradation in the investigated thin-film cells, indicating that the use of copper foil as a convenient carrier and rear contact does not require reconsideration for thin-film cells intended for space applications.

Abstract: Oil-in-oil phase change emulsions, composed of phase change materials (PCMs) dispersed in a continuous oily medium, have never been reported in the literature. The current study involves the formulation, stabilisation and characterisation of novel anhydrous emulsions of polyethylene glycol (PEG4000) as PCM in silicone oil. Emulsions with different dispersed phase concentrations were evaluated by analysing the viscous flow properties, optical microscopy and modulated differential scanning calorimetry. The results evidence that the emulsions can be pre-stabilised at 80 °C, under high shear conditions, by selecting an adequate silicone surfactant but undergo a severe destabilisation after a cooling and heating cycle. Nevertheless, a post-processing protocol (low shear agitation at 80 °C for 24 h) leads to thermal cycle resistant and storage stable non-aqueous dispersions. This process gives rise to a reduction of the shear-thinning character of the emulsion, shifts the melting and crystallization temperature of the PEG4000 to lower values and reduce its crystallinity. This is attributed to partial compatibility of the crystalline fraction of PEG4000 with other compounds of the emulsion.

Abstract: Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is encountered relatively commonly in the clinic and often results in long-term functional deficits. Research to develop methods to improve regeneration following nerve injury is ongoing. Numerous studies have shown that adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) promote the regeneration of peripheral nerve injury; however, the mechanism is unclear. Autophagy, a highly conserved intracellular process responsible for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and Schwann cells (SCs), play important roles in regeneration after PNI. In the present study, we explored the effect and mechanism of exosomes produced by adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC-Exos) on autophagy of SCs in PNI, as well as their effect on the regeneration of the nerve myelin sheath. The levels of autophagy and the expression of karyopherin subunit alpha 2 (Kpna2) in SCs increased markedly after the sciatic nerve was injured in SCs (SNI-SCs). The enhanced autophagy and the upregulated Kpna2 in SNI-SCs were inhibited after treatment with ADSC-Exos in vivo and in vitro. The effect of ADSC-Exos on inhibiting SC autophagy was blocked by overexpression of Kpna2 in SNI-SCs. Using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR, ADSC-Exos were demonstrated to contain a large amount of miRNA-26b, which was predicted to regulate Kpna2 on the TargetScan website. The effect of ADSC-Exos on inhibiting SCs autophagy was blocked after the silencing of miRNA-26b. Moreover, ADSC-Exos promoted the regeneration of the myelin sheath by inhibiting SC autophagy in rat SNI models. In conclusion, our results indicated that ADSC-Exos promote the regeneration of the myelin sheath by moderately reducing autophagy of injured SCs via miRNA-26b downregulation of Kpna2.

Abstract: The wet etching process that produces the textured surface consisting of pyramid structures has been a mature technology for mono-crystalline silicon (mono-Si) solar cells due to the advantages of its low fabrication cost as well as the excellent light trapping effect of such textured surface. Chemical additives such as hazardous solvents like isopropanol are commonly used to effectively assist the fabrication of pyramid structures in addition to the main alkali solution. In this paper, a novel additive that does not contain the hazardous solvents like isopropanol has been developed. The wet etching process using this additive can produce uniform pyramid structures on Si surface in just 7 min, which is at least 3 min shorter than the conventional wet etching process. The composition of this additive is systematically studied and analyzed in terms of the cell performance. We also compare the surface morphology, reflectivity, minority carrier lifetime, quantum efficiency and electroluminescence (EL) of the Si wafers with different textured surface produced by wet etching process using different additives. The results show that such novel additive contributes to the rapid formation of homogeneous small pyramid structures on the Si surface. The open circuit voltage, short circuit current density, fill factor and conversion efficiency of the corresponding passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) solar cells using such wet etching process are greatly improved, reaching 680 mV, 40.1 mA/cm2, 81.3% and 22.18%, respectively.

Abstract: Surface sulfurization is an effective way for CIGSe thin film to implement front graded bandgap. The controllable high S content with shallow diffusion depth into the film is key for the sulfurization. However, the degree of the sulfurization is closely related to the reaction temperature, thus it is difficult to control the diffusion depth of S into the CIGSe thin film effectively with high S content in such shallow depth. In this study, a pulsed sulfurization process is employed to realize a surface sulfurization as well as a high S content in a shallow diffusion depth of S into CIGSe at low substrate temperature, which provides an important way to fabricate double graded bandgap films prepared by post-selenization process. Structural analysis confirms the feasibility of the pulsed rapid thermal processing sulfurization. The device with surface sulfurization has the EA of N1 defects shifted to shallow position from 54 meV to 143 meV down to about 26 meV and 110 meV, respectively. The Voc, FF, and Jsc are improved obviously. Finally, the efficiency of CIGSSe thin film solar cell, based on the electrodeposition and selenization, increases by 20% with the improvement of Voc and FF.

Abstract: Molten salts are widely applied as heat transfer and thermal storage medium for solar thermal power. In order to research the effect of preparation conditions and the types of nanoparticles on the thermophysical properties of molten salt nanocomposite, different molten salt nanocomposites were developed by mixing the nitrates (Ca (NO3)2·4H2O–KNO3–NaNO3–NaNO2) with 1.0 wt% of SiO2, MgO, TiO2 and CuO nanoparticles using a microwave method, which was a new preparation process of molten salt nanocomposite based on high temperature mixing without water. The effect of different microwave heating temperature (250, 350 and 450 °C) and heating time (30, 60, 90 and 120 min) were experimentally studied. The melting point, latent heat and specific heat of the samples were analyzed by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The morphology was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results showed that the nanoparticles induced a decrease of the melting point of 0.1–2.4% while the latent heat decreased by 3.3–7.9%. Compared with other molten salt nanocomposites, the molten salt with the addition of SiO2 nanoparticles had the biggest increase in specific heat, which increased by 7.7% in solid state and 21.0% in liquid state after heating for 90 min at 250 °C. The total heat storage density could reach to 783.0 J/g between 30 and 500 °C, which was 13.3% higher than the base salt. In addition, according to the morphology of the samples, network nanostructures were observed in the molten salt nanocomposite doped with SiO2.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inﬂammatory disease, and it’s the leading cause of death worldwide. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been found to be associated with atherosclerosis. miR-520c-3p has been implicated in several types of cancer. However, little is known about the role of miR-520c-3p in atherosclerosis. In this study, we found that miR-520c-3p agomir decreased atherosclerotic plaque size, collagen content, the quantity of PCNA-positive cell and RelA/p65 expression of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the aortic valve of apoE−/− mice in vivo. The possible mechanisms of the protective effects of miR-520c-3p on atherosclerotic mice were then investigated in VSMCs. in vitro experiments showed that miR-520c-3p expressions were significantly reduced in human aortic vascular smooth muscle cell (HASMCs) treated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB). miR-520c-3p mimics repress PDGF-BB-mediated the proliferation, migration and decrease in the percentage of cells in G2/M phase, which was associated with downregulation of RelA/p65. Mechanistically, miRNA pull-down, luciferase reporter and mRNA stability assays confirmed miR-520c-3p mimics was able to directly target 3′-UTR of RelA/p65 mRNA and decreased half-life of RelA/p65 mRNA in HASMCs. Overexpression of RelA/p65 reversed the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by miR-520c-3p mimics in HASMCs. In conclusion, our findings suggest that miR-520c-3p inhibits PDGF-BB-mediated the proliferation and migration of HASMCs by targeting RelA/p65, which may provide potential therapeutic strategies in atherosclerosis treatment.

Abstract: In this paper, we reported a modified preparation process for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) films. For this process, Al2O3 capping layers were deposited on precursor films before selenization. It was found the capping layer can prevent the formation of separate CuxSe phase on top of the film and facilitate a homogeneous growth of the crystalline grains during selenization. Detailed characterizations revealed the reason: the Al2O3 capping layers can inhibit the incorporation of Se into the film in low-temperature region (below 350 °C). So the reaction between Se and Cu, which is thermodynamically preferential in this temperature region, can be prevented. As the disappearance of CuxSe, the traditional top-to-down crystallization mode was substituted by a homogeneous crystallization mode. Therefore, CZTSSe films with homogeneous crystallization properties were achieved. By using the capping layers, the efficiencies of the solar cells were improved. In particular, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the solar cell increased by ~18% by using the capping layers.

Abstract: BEAM conditioning regimen (carmustine [BCNU], etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) has been widely used for autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. However, BCNU-associated toxicities have prompted research to explore other options. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of bendamustine as an alternative to BCNU. We compared 71 patients who received either bendamustine (Benda-EAM group) or BCNU (BEAM group) conditioning. Considering previous reports of increased cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and mucositis, we adopted a lower bendamustine dose of 160 mg/m2/day administered for 2 days. There was no increase in nephrotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. Further, positive results were also obtained for neutrophil and platelet engraftment, appearing earlier in patients treated with Benda-EAM (10 vs. 14 days and 16 vs. 27 days, respectively). However, caution is warranted because an increased frequency of Grade 3 mucositis was observed in the Benda-EAM group (82.4% vs. 48%). This was accompanied by an increased need for parenteral nutrition. Despite the lower dose of bendamustine, the overall and progression-free survival rates were comparable between the Benda-EAM and BEAM groups. In conclusion, a lower dose of bendamustine may be an attractive alternative to BCNU as a tolerable treatment modality for patients with relapsed/refractory lymphoma.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell is an effective therapy in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphomas that, due to its unique toxicities, often requires escalation of care to the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin are serum inflammatory markers associated with onset and persistence of CAR T-cell-related toxicity.
Methods
We retrospectively analyzed 34 patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) who were divided into two groups: patients requiring admission to the ICU during initial hospitalization (n = 13, 38%) and those who did not (n = 21, 62%). Primary objective was to examine possible relationships between serum ferritin and/or CRP levels with the need for, and length of, ICU stay between these groups.
Results
All 13 patients admitted to the ICU developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 11 of them also developed neurotoxicity (NT). Of the 21 patients in the non-ICU group, 18 developed CRS and 5 patients developed NT. Grade of CRS and NT were higher in ICU versus non-ICU patients (p = .03 and .001, respectively). There was no correlation between CRP levels at time of ICU admission and length of ICU stay (correlation of 0.41, p = .17). Yet, there was an association between serum ferritin levels and length of ICU stay (R2 = 0.73) which did not reach statistical significance (correlation of 0.21, p = .49).
Conclusion
Notwithstanding the limitations of the small sample size, our study suggests that an elevated ferritin level at the time of escalation of medical care may be possibly indicative of anticipated prolonged ICU hospitalization in patients treated with axi-cel. A large multicenter study is certainly needed to confirm this observation.

Abstract: Power efficiency of Photovoltaic (PV) cell reduce due to the warm up under solar irradiation. Several passive and active cooling experimental investigations are implemented on a PV cell in this study to find out their impacts on the electrical and thermal performance of a PVT system. All experiments are performed in a solar simulator under a wide range (regular-concentrated) of solar radiation power (800–1700 W m−2). PCM is used as passive coolant system, whereas to overcome the malfunction of PCM, due its low thermal conductivity, PCM is infiltered in a special heat conductive foam (PS-CNT foam). Results revealed that PCM-composite can diminish the PV-cell temperature up to 6.8% and increase electrical effciciency up to 14.%. Separately, active cooling are examined by passing water with the range of 0.3–1 lit.min−1 through a cooling block mounted undre the PVT system. In the active cooling system, due to the efficient electrical power generation as well as harvesting thermal energy, the system performance is much higher than passive PVT systems. The best PVT system examined in this study is the PV-PCM-composite system which its energy efficiencies in the active cooling is 66.8–82.6%.

Abstract: The third generation of concentrating solar power (CSP) hybrid absorbers with enhanced solar absorptance and low thermal emittance (spectrally selective) is designed to have a high solar-to-thermal energy conversion efficiency, in spite of robust, long-term resistance to environmental loads. In this study, we report on the deposition, testing, and antioxidation properties of ultra-thin (1–3 nm) mono-, di-, and tri-layers of hybrid organic‒inorganic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) on Inconel 617. The latter is a well-known metal alloy, which is used as a CSP absorber material. Ultra-thin POSS layers were prepared by Langmuir‒Blodgett (LB) deposition. After deposition, the detailed signature characteristics of the POSS monolayer were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared reflection‒absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), and contact angle measurements. The XPS results with element concentration profiles reveal that the LB method enables the formation of a dense ultra-thin POSS coating on the Inconel surface, which eventually improves the antioxidation properties. To further test the corrosion resistance improvement of the developed coatings, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic tests were performed in 0.5 M NaCl solution. The as-obtained data were fitted with the corresponding equivalent circuit, which shows an increased charge transfer resistance (Rct) for coated samples. Tafel polarization plots show suppressed cathodic and anodic reaction rates for samples coated with ultra-thin POSS coatings. We envision that such coatings will have significant potential as a primer for spectrally selective absorber coatings for CSP technology.

Abstract: Electrochromic devices (ECDs) play an important role in smart window applications for blocking heat from sunlight. Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is one of the best candidates for making electrochromic films. Current manufacturing processes are, however, costly, have long processing time, and often use non-eco-friendly precursors. Here an alternative facile method integrating electro-exploding wire and spray coating techniques is demonstrated for applications in large size ECDs. The electro-exploding wire technique is used to synthesize WO3 nanomaterials (NMs) in deionized water. The varied size distribution of WO3 NMs is achieved by changing the exploding voltage. The NMs are characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The exploding voltage of 36 V is selected to generate WO3 NMs in a wide size distribution for making porous WO3 films. Subsequently, spray coating is used to disperse WO3 NM suspension on the ITO/glass substrate to form an electrochromic film. The films are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by cycle voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and chronocoulometry measurements in dilute sulfuric acid. The WO3 NM films prepared at a high exploding voltage and a high substrate temperature present a higher electrochemical stability. Considering porosity and electrochemical stability, WO3 NMs exploded at 36 V are used to prepare WO3 films on substrates heated at 300 °C. The electrochromic WO3 film can be operated for over 1000 cycles. We demonstrate an ECD with an area of 15 × 15 cm2 and propose a way to make large size ECDs with low cost and eco-friendly processes.

Abstract: The most concern of using nitrate salt mixtures in a concentrated solar power plant is their corrosion to the working pipes and containers. This paper studied the corrosion behavior of stainless steel 316 in a ternary nitrate salt mixture at three different conditions using static corrosion method. The mass losses of each sample were carefully measured. The instantaneous and average corrosion rates were predicted. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies with the corrosion products of the 316SS coupons after the test were investigated using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) combined with EDS (Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and XRD (X-ray Diffraction) analyses. The results showed that temperature is the main factor to affect the average corrosion rate, for example, 0.0032 mm/a at 300 °C and 0.016 mm/a at 500 °C during the test period. At 300 °C, adding 10 wt% EG can reduce the average corrosion rate by 20%. The cross-sectional morphologies revealed that the corrosion layer of 316SS coupon in the composite with 10 wt% EG was 1/3 thinner than that in pure salt mixture at 300 °C. That was because the CaCO3 phase formed by the reaction of Ca(NO3)2 and EG could work as a protective layer to prevent further corrosion to some extent.

Abstract: Passivating the contacts of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells (SC) with a poly-crystalline silicon (poly-Si) layer on top of a thin silicon oxide (SiOx) is currently sparking interest for reducing carrier recombination at the interface between the metal electrode and the c-Si substrate. However, due to the interrelation between different mechanisms at play, a comprehensive understanding of the surface passivation provided by the poly-Si/SiOx contact in the final SC has not been achieved yet. In the present work, we report on an original ex-situ doping process of the poly-Si layer through the deposition of a B-rich dielectric layer followed by an annealing step to diffuse B dopants in the layer. We propose an in-depth investigation of the passivation scheme of the resulting B-doped poly-Si/SiOx contact by first comparing the surface passivation provided by ex-situ doped and intrinsic poly-Si/SiOx contacts at different steps of the fabrication process. The excellent surface passivation properties obtained with the ex-situ doped poly-Si(B) contact (iVoc = 733 mV and J0 = 6.1 fA cm−2) attests to the good quality of this contact. We then propose further STEM, ECV and ToF-SIMS characterizations to assess: i) the evolution of the microstructure and B-doping profile through ex-situ doping and ii) the diffusion profile of hydrogen in the poly-Si contact. Our results show a gradual filling of the poly-Si layer with active B dopants with increasing annealing temperature (Ta), which strengthens the field-effect passivation and enables an iVoc increase after annealing up to 800 °C. We also observe a diffusion of O from the SiON:B doping layer to the interfacial SiOx layer during annealing, that likely enhances the passivation stability of our ex-situ doped poly-Si contact with increasing Ta. Finally, we conclude that the mechanism dominating the surface passivation changes during the fabrication process of the poly-Si/SiOx contact from field-effect passivation after annealing (performed for B-diffusion in the contact) to chemical passivation after following hydrogenation of the samples (performed by depositing a H-rich silicon nitride layer).

Abstract: Cullin 4B (CUL4B), encoding a scaffold protein in Cullin RING ubiquitin-ligase complexes (CRL4B), is overexpressed and serves as an oncogene in various solid tumors. However, the roles and the underlying mechanisms of CUL4B in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that CUL4B was significantly upregulated in RCC cells and clinical specimens, and its overexpression was correlated with poor survival of RCC patients. Knockdown of CUL4B resulted in the inhibition of proliferation, migration and invasion of RCC cells. Furthermore, we found that the expression of CUL4B is positively correlated with c-Met expression in RCC cells and tissues. Konckdown of c-Met or treatment with c-Met inhibitor, SU11274, could block the increase in cell proliferation, migration and invasion induced by CUL4B-overexpression. We also showed that CUL4B overexpression significantly accelerated xenograft tumor growth, and administration of SU11274 could also abrogate the accelerated tumor growth induced by CUL4B overexpression in vivo. These findings shed light on the contribution of CUL4B to tumorigenesis in RCC via activating c-Met signaling and its therapeutic implications in RCC patients.

Abstract: Due to the general price pressure PV modules experienced in the last decade, a variety of alternative polymer materials and new backsheet designs were developed and introduced into the market, amongst others also extruded backsheets based on polypropylene (PP). The production of co-extruded films represents a backward integration of backsheet manufacturers, allowing for easy material and design modifications regarding additive formulation, fillers and geometry. The main objective of this paper was to describe the influence of the special properties of PP-based backsheets on the performance and reliability of PV modules. The higher reflectance of the PP backsheet compared to a reference polyester (PET) based laminate led to an increase in power output between 1.5 and 2.5%. Test modules using PP and PET backsheets were exposed to 3000 h of damp heat testing. No changes in power output for either of the test modules was observed. However, the selective permeation properties of PP backsheets prevent humidity from entering the module (similarly to PET based backsheets) but allow for significantly higher diffusion of acetic acid out of the PV module. Therefore, in contrast to test modules using Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) encapsulants and PET backsheets, no silver grid corrosion was observed for modules using PP backsheets. Co-extruded backsheets based on PP show great potential to be a valid replacement of standard PET based backsheets in PV modules. On the one hand, the PP backsheet so far proved excellent stability, exhibiting no severe material degradation after extended exposure to temperature, humidity and irradiation. On the other hand, its improved functional properties (optical properties; selective permeability) lead to increased performance and improved long-term stability of the tested PV modules.

Abstract: Spectrally selective W/WAlSiN/SiON/SiO2 solar absorber coatings were sputter-deposited on stainless steel and silicon substrates. The optimized as-deposited sample exhibits a high solar absorptance of 0.955 and a low thermal emissivity of 0.10 at 82 °C. The coating exhibits a very low reflectance of 1.2% in the wavelength range of 0.5–1.5 μm in the solar spectrum. The spectral emissivity measurements at various operating temperatures and with varying emergence angles were investigated. Also, the impact of emissivity on the photothermal efficiency at different temperatures of the developed solar absorber coating was calculated. The calculated optical properties of the as-deposited sample exhibited low thermal emissivity of 0.157 (at 500 °C) and a high heliothermal efficiency of 89.5%. Angular reflectance measured at room temperature illustrates an insignificant change in the hemispherical and near normal emissivities of the samples. In addition to these studies, the ageing tests of the as-deposited samples at various operating temperatures were studied in detail. The thermal ageing tests of the samples in air and vacuum environments indicated excellent thermal stability at elevated temperatures, i.e., in air at 400 °C for 500 h, at 450 °C for 175 h and at 500 °C for 100 h, whereas, in a vacuum it was stable at 700 °C for 200 h. The top anti-reflection layers and the fine nano-multilayers of WAlSiN (W2N and AlSiN) prevent the inward diffusion of oxygen and thereby improve the overall thermal stability of the tandem absorber.

Abstract: An in-depth investigation of the BaO2/BaO redox couple for reversible solar thermochemical energy storage has been performed. Beyond improving the cyclability and energy storage density of the material, an additional objective of this work is to better understand inconsistencies in the literature surrounding this chemistry. Sintering of BaO2/BaO is a hindrance for practical high temperature energy storage. MgO-stabilized BaO-based materials were synthesized by co-precipitation methods and investigated for improving the longevity and reactivity of the redox materials. The effect of the calcination environment during synthesis on sample purity was evaluated. Energy storage capacity and stability of commercial BaO2 and BaO2 made by co-precipitation methods were compared over 25 consecutive redox cycles. The effect of different amounts of MgO was studied, and it was discovered that with increasing amounts of MgO, the stability and reactivity of BaO2 increases while the energy storage density decreases. 15 wt% MgO/BaO2 exhibits the greatest stable weight gain/loss with a value of 6.62% (estimated 338 kJ/kg). A BaO2/MgO sample with 33 wt% MgO shows good storage capacity with weight gain/loss at 5.65% (corresponds to approximately 290 kJ/kg) over 200 redox cycles.

The bandgap value and bandgap type of GaPSb alloy are determined on the whole Sb range, by combining experimental absorption measurements with tight binding (TB) theoretical calculations. The indirect (X-band) to direct (Γ-band) cross-over is found to occur at 30% Sb content. Especially, at a Sb content of 32%, the GaP1-xSbx alloy reaches the desired 1.7eV direct bandgap, enabling efficient sunlight absorption, that can be ideally combined with the Si 1.1 eV bandgap. Moreover, the band alignment of GaP1-xSbx alloys and Si with respect to water redox potential levels has been analyzed, which shows the GaPSb/Si association is an interesting combination both for the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. These results open new routes for the development of III-V/Si low-cost high-efficiency photoelectrochemical cells.

Abstract: As the electrical characteristics of silicon solar cells depend significantly on their temperature T of operation, it is vital to analyze and understand the contributions of the various cell properties in detail in order to optimize silicon solar cells for improved energy output in realistic operation conditions. Within a detailed electro-optical solar cell model, as used for numerical device simulation, accounting for full T-dependence of all cell properties has rarely been attempted to date. This is mainly due to the T-dependence of simulation input parameters not being well known or difficult to measure, resulting in unknown inaccuracy for T-dependent device simulations. This study improves previous T-dependent device models by including the T-dependence of injection-dependent bulk lifetime τbulk as well as lumped skin surface recombination parameter J0,skin, which are commonly assumed T-independent, for the “lumped skin” multidimensional device model employed by the software Quokka3. With this improved T-dependent device model, we present a comprehensive breakdown of a typical PERC cell's temperature sensitivity by each simulation input parameter. As figures of merit we simulate T-coefficients of IV-parameters, as well as energy yields. Overall, we find that the relative influence of the T-dependence of τbulk and J0,skin is rather small for our examples, clarifying that for modeling typical PERC cells neglecting of their T-dependence does not result in a substantial error. Nonetheless, T-dependency of the bulk material has been found to vary significantly. Also, there remains substantial uncertainty of actual T-dependence of recombination at contacts and lowly doped surfaces worth of further investigations.

Abstract: Phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase (LHPP), a histidine phosphatase, plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis as a tumor suppressor. Here, we investigate the effect of LHPP in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). We discovered that LHPP was downregulated in tumor tissues and low levels of LHPP predicted poor survival. LHPP inhibited ICC cell growth, cell invasion and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, LHPP deactivated transforming growth factor‑beta (TGFβ) signaling pathway, and low level LHPP upregulated the expression of TGFβ and phosphorylation of smad2/3. Moreover, inhibition of this pathway reversed the biofunction of LHPP. In summary, these findings demonstrated that LHPP suppressed ICC through inhibiting the activation of TGFβ/smad signaling. Our results indicated that LHPP is a potential therapeutic target in ICC.

Abstract: The design and synthesis of broad absorption electrochromic materials (ECMs) that modulate visible and near infrared light are important for energy-saving smart windows. Most studies on broad absorption ECMs have focused on transition metal oxides, organic polymers and small organic molecules based on triarylamines, while studies on viologen analogues are scarce. In the current study, two tetra-substituted viologen analogues 4,4′,4″,4‴-(benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrayl)- tetrakis(1-butylpyridin-1-ium) (BTTBP) and 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(4-(1-butyl-pyridin-4-yl)- phenyl)ethane (TBPPE) were prepared by introducing benzene and tetraphenylethylene with large conjugation degrees as parent moieties. Compared with the conventional viologen 1,1′-dibutyl-(4,4′-bipyridine)-1,1′-diium without a conjugated parent, BTTBP and TBPPE exhibited high electrochromic performance and broad absorption to the near infrared region. TBPPE in particular exhibited excellent broad absorption electrochromic behavior with high optical contrast (63% at 733 nm and 46% at 997 nm), distinct color change (pale yellow to yellow-green to black-green), good cycling stability (attenuation in optical contrast of 1% after 1000 cycles at 733 nm) and excellent coloration efficiency (251 cm2/C) in the near infrared region. These findings provide a strategy for designing high-performance cathode broad absorption ECMs and a promising candidate for energy-saving smart windows.

Abstract: The current challenge for the application of organic phase change materials is to compromise the conflicting influence of high thermal conductivity matrix content on the heat storage performance and thermal conductivity of phase change composites. Herein, we prepared graphene aerogel (GA) and GA-based paraffin phase change composite (GAP) by the widely reported hydrothermal method and studied the application potential of GA in GAP. The underlying mechanism of paraffin latent heat enhancement caused by GA was discussed from the perspective of the crystallization and phase change process of paraffin. X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry results showed that as the GA content increased, the paraffin in GAP had an increased crystallinity and exhibited increased latent heat. Activation energy of paraffin's phase change process calculated according to Kissinger model was effectively reduced when GA content was greater than 7.3 wt%, implying a considerable increase in the thermal response rate of GAP. In addition, in order to improve the thermal conductivity enhancement efficiency of GA, thermal conductivity of GAP was predicted by finite element numerical simulation. A good agreement was observed between the experimental and numerical results and some practical suggestions were made for the experimental preparation process.

Abstract: PCM emulsions represent a common type of fluid media for thermal energy storage (TES) systems. However, a major challenge for their application is to maintain a stable homogeneous fluid. Reduction of the droplet size is one of the most effective approaches for improving stability, such as the preparation of nano-emulsions. This work aims to develop stable PCM-water nano-emulsions prepared with n-hexadecane by manipulating the key emulsification factors, particularly the emulsifier combinations and process conditions. Two low-energy emulsification methods, phase inversion temperature (PIT) and emulsion inversion point (EIP), were applied to prepare the nano-emulsions, using Brij L4 as the emulsifier. Several important properties of the emulsions were evaluated including droplet size distribution, conductivity, and rheological characteristics and the stability of emulsions over extended periods and multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Moreover, the thermal performance for their potential application in TES systems were examined. Eventually, nano-emulsions with small and uniform droplets were obtained by both PIT and EIP methods with suitable emulsifier concentrations. The smallest droplet size (~60 nm) was attained with 11% emulsifier and 30% PCM by the PIT method, and the most stable emulsion attained with 15% of emulsifier and 30% of PCM. The PCM nano-emulsions behaved as a Newtonian liquid with a good fluidity and a superior stability over long-time storage and freezing-cycles. The degree of supercooling was reduced with the addtion of nano SiO2 as a nucleating agent. The findings from the study are useful for better understanding of the controlling factors and further development of stable and effective nano-emulsions.

Abstract: Background and aims
Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) is a key scavenger receptor in the control of macrophage uptake of oxidised low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL). CD36 expression levels are not down regulated by intracellular cholesterol but are upregulated by oxidised low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) leading to the formation of lipid loaded foam cells, a major constituent of atherosclerotic plaques. We have previous shown that CD36 is down regulated by 7,8-dihydroneopterin, an antioxidant generated by γ-interferon activated macrophages. How CD36 down regulation affects oxLDL induced cytotoxicity, CD36 oxLDL upregulation and foam cell formation is examined using human monocyte like U937 cell line as a model system of human macrophages.
Methods
Low density lipoprotein (LDL) was prepared by ultracentrifugation from human plasma and oxidised in copper chloride. CD36 levels in U937 cells were measured by western blot analysis. and lipid accumulation was measured by oil red-O staining and 7-ketocholesterol accumulation by high performance liquid chromatography. Cell viability was measured by flow cytometry analysis after propidium iodide staining.
Results
7,8-dihydroneopterin concentrations above 100 μM caused a concentration and time dependent decrease in cellular CD36 levels to 20 % of the untreated cells after 24 h. Upregulation of CD36 by oxLDL was inhibited by 7,8-dihydroneopterin treatment. The CD36 down regulation was associated with decrease in foam cell formation but not a reduction on oxLDL cytotoxicity.
Conclusions
7,8-dihydroneopterin down regulated CD36 in U937 cells, inhibiting foam cell formation but not oxLDL mediated cell death. 7,8-dihydroneopterin may modulate foam cell formation in atherosclerotic plaques.

Abstract: Strong band bending within crystalline silicon is important for improving carrier selectivity in the contact regions of silicon heterojunction solar cells. In this work, we compare the use of capacitance-voltage as an alternative to the surface photovoltage method for probing the built-in voltage associated with crystalline silicon band bending. The surface photovoltage technique is incapable of measuring structures with non-transparent contacts, while the capacitance-voltage technique shows saturation at high built-in voltages due to the formation of an inversion layer. The shift in built-in voltage and effect on open circuit voltage are demonstrated for variation across a range of amorphous Si p-doping levels. These experimental results are supported by simulation work, confirming the underlying band structure and carrier concentrations of photovoltaic Si heterojunctions and clarifying the limitations of capacitance measurements at high built-in voltages. Errors arising in capacitance-voltage measurements of these structures are explained and linked to deviations from the Mott-Schottky model approximations of a one-sided junction in full depletion.

Abstract: Stable function of hybrid electrochromic devices (ECDs) is achieved by the application of quasi-solid-state redox electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. For this purpose, a polymeric gel electrolyte based on an imidazolium ionic liquid (IL)-functionalized siloxane network is prepared. First, a sol-gel processable, bis end-capped trialkoxysilyl-functionalized imidazolium-based IL is synthesized. The characteristics of the IL enable solvolysis and condensation on both ends of the molecule. In this way, the crosslinked IL forms a firm and brittle gel, as confirmed by IR and 29Si NMR analyses. The addition of iodine for I−/I3− redox pair formation does not produce a gel with sufficiently high ionic conductivity for ECD assembly. To obtain a more conductive gel electrolyte with an ionic conductivity of the order of magnitude 10−3 S cm−1, a nonreactive, 1-methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide IL is added as the cosolvent. These redox electrolytes with different concentrations of iodine are tested in hybrid EC devices for ~11,000 cycles. All the devices reveal an increase in lightness with cycling, either for the bleached or colored states, which occur due to gradual transformation of I5− to I3− and I− species. In situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry is applied to gain insight into the ECDs during 1250 cycles of functioning and enables the various iodide species to be differentiated.

Abstract: Phase change materials are widely used as thermal capacitors in solar thermal systems. The phase change materials with carbon materials could directly absorb the solar energy and transfer to water for building heating, while are rarely reported. In this work, an Ethylene-Propylene-Diene Monomer based phase change material with expanded graphite is prepared. The photo-thermal performance of the phase change material is investigated with combined experimental and numerical method. The SiO2 aerogel is first used as the thermal insulator in the solar thermal systems with the high transmittance and low thermal conductivity. The effect of the phase change material height and tube passes number on the photo-thermal performance of the phase change materials are calculated. The results show that the new material has a tensile strength of 3.6 MPa, enthalpy of 126.8 J g−1，and thermal conductivity of 1.106 W m−1 K−1. The phase change material with SiO2 aerogel could resist heat lost on the surface. The phase change material has good photo-thermal performance in solar thermal systems, could heat more than 200 L of hot water at daytime.

Abstract: A novel spectrally selective coating was developed on stainless substrates using commercially available poly(ethylene-3,4-dioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate), (PEDOT:PSS) polymer for solar energy harvesting applications. An intrinsic (i.e., single) absorber layer concept was used to develop this coating. The as-prepared PEDOT:PSS dispersion was applied on substrates with thickness in the range of 0.1–5.8 μm using an automated spray deposition system, and the effect of thickness on the optical properties was studied in detail. The intrinsic properties of PEDOT:PSS resulted in high absorptance and low emittance, this was ascertained using glass, quartz and KBR pellets. With optimization of coating thickness, the reflectance edge shifted towards higher wavelength and near perfect absorption was obtained over a broad wavelength range leading to very high absorptance. The optimized PEDOT:PSS coating (approximately 5.8 μm thick) deposited on stainless steel substrates exhibited absorptance of 0.967 and emittance of 0.36.

Abstract: Radiative cooling (RC) of solar cells has received growing attention in recent years primarily due to its passive nature as compared to the other active cooling techniques. By using novel high emittance materials, the RC technique can also be integrated with a photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) system, to eventually improve the system's total efficiency (electrical and thermal output) during the day and provide additional cooling power at night. To quantify the effect of enhanced RC in a PVT system, this study investigated the performance of a regular glass encapsulated PVT module, and a spectrally modified module by using a polydimethylsiloxane coating on top of the glass layer to simulate enhanced RC. An experimentally validated simulation model was developed for performance comparison. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of varying input parameters on system output performance. Results show that during the day, solar cell operating temperature reduced by most 1.7 °C, and electrical efficiency and total exergy efficiency increased by 0.76% and 0.5%, respectively. As for nighttime, an additional 4–7 W/m2 cooling power can be obtained. Although some improvements, the potential gains achieved by integrating enhanced RC in PVT systems are not substantially large as compared to the regular glass encapsulation in commercial PVT modules, since glass naturally has a fairly high emittance in the atmospheric window.

Abstract: A Photo(catalytic) Fuel Cell based on a CdS/TiO2 photoanode and using ethanol as model fuel has been studied as an electric power source to charge a vanadium redox battery. The Photo Fuel Cell was tested under various current production conditions in terms of stability and power output capacity. The cell was functional and produced substantial electric power by consuming an organic fuel under simulated solar energy irradiation. However, it has been found that CdS sensitizer may undergo a self-oxidation process which is relatively fast when the current output is large but is much slower when the current production is low. The conditions for slow self-oxidation have thus been delimited and this allowed determining the conditions for charging the vanadium redox battery using electricity produced by the Photo Fuel Cell. These findings set the basis for production of sustainable electricity and for its storage in a vanadium redox battery.

Abstract: We have simulated a perovskite solar cell by developing a comprehensive mathematical model which incorporates drift-diffusion and heat transfer equations. This model incorporates all the heat transfer mechanisms, including the thermal power generation due to the tail state recombination and thermalization of charge carriers. Our model is validated by calculating the current-voltage characteristics of a PSC of the structure of Glass/PEDOT: PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC60BM/Al and finding it in very good agreement with the experimental results. The influence of grain boundary diameter on the operating temperature of the PSC is investigated in detail. It is found that by increasing the diameter of the grain boundaries, the operating temperature of the PSC decreases at higher voltages and the open circuit voltage increases slightly. The thermal power generated by the thermalization is found to play the dominant role in the operating temperature followed by the thermal power generated at the grain boundaries due to the highest tail state recombination in the region. This study is expected to provide a deeper understanding about different factors that influence the operating temperature of perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: A detailed understanding of charge-carrier behavior could provide new avenues to improve the performance of the solar cell by enhancing the active materials and electronic properties. In the present work, the transport mechanism of photogenerated carriers in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 or CIGS)-based solar cells is investigated by analysis of the temperature-dependent current density-voltage (J-V) curves obtained under various illumination (i.e., dark, AM 1.5G, 650 nm, and 405 nm). The results demonstrate that J-V curve distortion, termed the “roll-over” effect, is significantly correlated with the illumination wavelength and, more importantly, is strongly associated with the persistent characteristics of the CIGS solar cell. In addition, the nature of the photo-induced defects and their influence on the transport mechanism of the photogenerated carriers were investigated via deep level capacitance profiling (DLCP) and admittance spectroscopy (AS) under various illumination conditions. The photo-capacitance results indicate distinct spatial distributions and persistent behaviors depending upon the illumination wavelength. Based on the findings in this work, the origin of the non-ideal J-V behavior in the CIGS solar cell is explained, and the spatial defect distribution and illumination wavelength sensitivity are discussed.

Abstract: Microencapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs) are not only important thermal energy storage medium but can also be applied in harvesting and storage of solar thermal energy by using solar absorbent materials as the shell. In this study, high energy storage polyurea (PUA) microPCMs for photothermal storage were fabricated from a Pickering emulsion consisting of bio-derived and sustainable regenerated chitin (RCh) from shrimp shells as the emulsifier. Graphene oxide (GO) was used as the photon captor and paraffin wax as the phase change material (PCM). The chemical, physical and thermal properties of the resulting microPCMs were studied. Using 0.1% w/w RCh Pickering emulsifier and 0.1% w/w GO to modify the microPCM, a 92.3% encapsulation efficiency was achieved. The microPCM at a core/shell ratio of 9:1 stored up to 234.7 J/g heat energy, was leak proof, and thermally reliable over 100 heating and cooling cycles with efficient photothermal conversion up to 76.03% conversion efficiency. Therefore, this cost-effective green process can be embraced for fabrication of high-energy storage and reliable functional microPCMs.

Abstract: The electrical output characteristics of a three-terminal tandem solar cell with top and interdigitated back contacts were experimentally investigated under different external loading and current mismatch conditions. Regardless of the chosen loading topology (i.e., which terminal is common), the output power for the two sub-circuits of the three-terminal tandem added up to the same value. However, the current–voltage curve of one sub-circuit depended on the loading topology and biasing condition of the other sub-circuit, which can be explained by a simple equivalent circuit model. A negative current was observed for two topologies depending on the current mismatch between the top and bottom cells, which suggests power injection into one of the sub-circuits. This negative current did not appear for a third topology. These results indicate that the third topology is a useful way to maximise the power, especially under spectrum-varying conditions.

Abstract: A comparison study of ultrathin atomic layer deposited AlOx, wet-chemically oxidized SiOx, and their combination as the tunnel layer in TOPCon structure with both B-doped and P-doped poly-Si contact layers on n-type c-Si wafers was carried out. The passivation quality with the three types of tunnel layers was examined as a function of thickness and annealing temperature. Ideally, the high density of negative fixed charge in the AlOx is expected to provide a positive benefit on the passivation quality with p-type poly-Si as the contact layer, however, it is surprisingly observed that the AlOx and AlOx/SiOx do not yield a better passivation than the SiOx. Searching for the mechanisms behind, an interesting phenomenon is observed that the AlOx, especially the AlOx/SiOx bi-layer, significantly enhances B diffusion and suppresses P diffusion. It is also found a remarkable accumulation of B in the AlOx and AlOx/SiOx region, forming a reservoir for B diffusion. Furthermore, the free carrier assistant extrinsic diffusion is an additional factor for the enhanced B and retarded P diffusions by the AlOx/SiOx. The enhanced B diffusion causes extra Auger recombination as well as recombination through B–O pair defects and degrades the p-TOPCon passivation quality; additionally, a quantity of Al diffuse into the c-Si wafer could be another potential factor degrading passivation quality, because Al forms deep-level defects and induces a significant SRH recombination.

Abstract: Zn2+-based electrochromic is a newly born technology in recent years and has attracted the attention of most researchers due to its low cost and high safety. The design of high-performance Zn2+-based electrochromic devices, such as large light modulation and fast color change, is still a challenge. Here, we report the improvement of Zn2+-based electrochromic properties by morphology control, using common electrochromic material WO3 as the research model. The hexagonal WO3 films with shape of nanorods and nanoflakes were prepared by hydrothermal method, where the diameter of the nanorods and the thickness of the nanoflakes are almost the same. The electrochromic characterization of WO3 nanorods and nanoflakes at 550 nm showed that their modulation ranges were 72.4% and 61.0%, their coloration times were 3 and 9 s, their bleaching times were 2.2 and 7 s, and their coloration efficiencies were 67.6 and 53.8 cm2 C-1, respectively. Compared with WO3 nanoflakes, the excellent Zn2+-based electrochromic properties of WO3 nanorods show rapid electron transfer kinetics caused by large surface area. Furthermore, the prototype electrochromic devices with WO3 nanorods were fabricated, which showed good specific capacitance and excellent electrochromic performance. The fast and large optical modulation synchronous as well as good energy storage makes the electrochromic device become a potential intelligent power supply. This morphology dependent electrochromic work provides a new vision for the construction of high-performance Zn2+- based electrochromic devices.

Abstract: Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that can cause serious public health problems. The development of a safe and effective vaccine against T. gondii is urgently needed to prevent and control the spread of toxoplasmosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune responses induced by a pcGRA14 + pcROP13 vaccine cocktail in BALB/c mice. All groups were immunized intramuscularly three times at two-week intervals. The production of anti-Toxoplasma gondii lysate antigen (TLA) antibodies, lymphocyte proliferation, serum levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 cytokines and the survival time were monitored after vaccination and challenged with the virulent RH strain of T. gondii. The results showed that immunization with the pcGRA14 + pcROP13 DNA vaccine significantly increased the production of specific IgG antibodies and cytokines against toxoplasmosis. Interestingly, high levels of IgG2a and IFN-γ were found in animals vaccinated with DNA vaccine cocktail. Furthermore, immunized mice challenged with the RH strain of T. gondii showed prolonged survival time when compared to control groups (P <0.05). The present study demonstrates the potential of a DNA cocktail vaccine expressing pcGRA14 and pcROP13 in developing specific immune responses and providing effective protection against T. gondii infection.

Abstract: Passivating contacts are key enablers for high efficiency c-Si solar cells. Here, we present our latest advancement in terms of implementation and understanding in fired passivating contacts (FPC) used as rear p + passivating contact in p-type solar cells. We study three different layer configurations and show that the microstructural layer properties play a major role on the surface passivation and charge carrier transport. Upon optimization we demonstrate implied open circuit voltage of 722 mV corresponding to saturation current density of ~7 fA/cm2 and contact resistances below 10 mΩ cm2, when metallized with ITO/Ag. P-type c-Si solar cells employing a screen-printed P-diffused emitter co-fired with the FPC on the rear side with conversion efficiency up to 22.5% are demonstrated. Temperature-dependent measurements on test structures and solar cells reveal that tunneling is the main transport mechanism for FPC layers that crystallize during the firing process, whereas for more amorphous FPC layers, an additional component due to thermionic emission is also present. Finally, we present the efficiency potential of solar cells employing the developed FPC layer as hole selective rear side passivating contact.

Abstract: Thin film CdTe superstrate solar cells have been fabricated by sputtering starting from CdS/CdSe front layers deposited on transparent conductor coated glass. The performance of such devices is sensitive to the fabrication details including the temperature-time profile, which leads to CdSe/CdTe interdiffusion and formation of a CdTe1-xSex bandgap-graded absorber. Mapping spectroscopic ellipsometry (M-SE) has been applied to the CdS and CdSe thin films for process calibration, which involves determining the deposition rate in terms of effective thickness (volume/area) versus spatial position on the sample. The goal is to optimize the performance of the devices by correlating cell parameters with these two effective thicknesses. Intended variations in the thicknesses along with unintended spatial non-uniformities enable coarse and fine-scale optimization, respectively. Using these methods, the highest performance solar cells from the CdS/CdSe/CdTe structure are obtained with 13 nm CdS and 100 nm CdSe. An increase in the CdS thickness above 13 nm leads to a decrease in open-circuit voltage and fill-factor attributed to the formation of a CdSe1-zSz interdiffusion region with z approaching 0.5, where the alloy electronic properties are likely to suffer. Our results demonstrate that M-SE, exploited in conjunction with deposition non-uniformities, serve as a viable approach for process optimization of complex solar cell structures.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a treatment for benign and malignant hematological diseases. These aggressive treatments cause reduced levels of physical activity, decreased lung function, and worse quality of life. Alterations in pulmonary function tests before HSCT are associated with the risk of respiratory failure and early mortality. The objective of this study was to evaluate functional capacity and lung function before and after HSCT and identify the predictors of mortality after 2 years.
Methods
A prospective cohort study was carried out with individuals with oncohematological diseases. The evaluations were carried out in two moments during hospitalization and at hospital discharge. Follow-up was carried out after 48 months. Assessments were carried out on 34 adults, using spirometry, manovacuometry, 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Handgrip Strength Test, and 30-Second Chair Stand Test (30-s CST).
Results
There was a statistically significant reduction for the variables in forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume predicted in the 1st second, Tiffeneau index, handgrip strength, and distance covered (% predicted) on the 6MWT (p < .05). There was a significant difference in the 30-s CST when individuals were compared according to the type of transplant. We found that a 10% reduction in the values of maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) can predict an increased risk for mortality.
Conclusions
Individuals undergoing HSCT have reduced functional capacity, lung function, and muscle strength during the hospitalization phase. Reduction in the values of MIP increases the risk of nonrelapse mortality.

Abstract: Smart windows, capable of selective filtering of solar spectral radiation can help to significantly reduce the energy consumption by heating and cooling systems. However, robust and industry-standard designs of such windows, tunable for all-weather conditions, have been a challenge to date. In this work, we report on the design of ultra-thin electrotunable smart window ‘glasses’ using noble metals as well as their relatively-inexpensive alternatives. We adopt a lithography-free design approach using multilayer metallo-dielectric structure, that can dynamically control the intensity of transmitted solar radiation, depending upon the weather/climate condition. We make use of an electro-optic polymer as dielectric, which on applying voltage, changes the effective refractive index by virtue of electro-optic effect, allowing tunable filtering of visible and infrared radiation over a voltage range of −15 V to +15 V. Our theoretical results are in excellent agreement with those of full-wave simulations. Our design is robust, ultra-thin (60–100 nm thick), large-area compatible, polarization-independent, and angle-insensitive (up to 75 degrees). Aluminium oxynitride based glasses are suitable for designing military-grade, bulletproof, portable, and blast-resistant windows. The figure-of-merit calculations reveal that our relatively-inexpensive metals can outperform industry-standard commercial glasses as well as infrared-blocking plasmonic glasses, reported in the literature.
