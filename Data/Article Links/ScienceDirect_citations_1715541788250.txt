Abstract: Discharge of the intracellular Ca2+ stores activates Ca2+ entry through store-operated channels (SOCs). Since the recent identification of STIM1 and STIM2, as well as the Orai1 homologs, Orai2 and Orai3, the protein complexes involved in Ca2+ signaling needs re-evaluation in native cells. Using real time PCR combined with Western blotting we have found the expression of the three Orai isoforms, STIM1, STIM2 and different TRPCs in human platelets. Depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin, independently of changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, enhanced the formation of a signaling complex involving STIM1, STIM2, Orai1, Orai2 and TRPC1. Furthermore, platelet treatment with the dyacylglicerol analog 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) resulted in specific association of Orai3 with TRPC3. Treatment of platelets with arachidonic acid enhanced the association between Orai1 and Orai3 in human platelets and overexpression of Orai1 and Orai3 in HEK293 cells increased arachidonic acid-induced Ca2+ entry. These results indicate that Ca2+ store depletion results in the formation of exclusive signaling complexes involving STIM proteins, as well as Orai1, Orai2 and TRPC1, but not Orai3, which seems to be involved in non-capacitative Ca2+ influx in human platelets.

Abstract: Programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4) is a novel tumor suppressor, whose expression is frequently down-regulated in several types of cancers. In the present study, we demonstrated that Pdcd4 knockdown up-regulates MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP4K1) expression and increases phosphorylation of c-Jun. Over-expression of c-Myc in HEK293 cells increases the levels of MAP4K1, MAP4K1 promoter activity, and phospho-c-Jun. Mutation analysis showed that the c-Myc binding site at −536bp (relative to the initiation ATG) of map4k1 promoter responds to c-Myc regulation. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that c-Myc directly binds to map4k1 promoter at this site. Down-regulation of c-Myc reverses MAP4K1 expression and AP-1 activation in Pdcd4 knockdown cells. Moreover, over-expression of dominant negative Tcf4 decreases expression of c-Myc and MAP4K1, JNK activation, and AP-1 dependent transcription. Thus, activation of β-catenin/Tcf dependent transcription in Pdcd4 knockdown cells up-regulates MAP4K1 expression and AP-1 activity via c-Myc. The study presented here further reveals in detail the mechanism of how Pdcd4 inhibits tumor cell invasion and provides a functional connection between β-catenin/Tcf and AP-1 dependent transcription.

Abstract: β- and γ-secretase cleave the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to release the amyloidogenic β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). Aβ has been widely believed to initiate pathogenic cascades culminating in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiological functions of the AICD remain elusive. In this study, we found the AICD to strongly inhibit Wnt-induced transcriptional reporter activity, and to counteract Wnt-induced c-Myc expression. Loss of the AICD resulted in an increased responsiveness to Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription. Mechanically, the AICD was found to interact with glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and promote its kinase activity. The subsequent AICD-strengthened Axin–GSK3β complex potentiates β-catenin poly-ubiquitination. Functional studies in N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and primary neurons showed that the AICD facilitated neurite outgrowth. And AICD antagonised Wnt3a-suppressed growth arrest and neurite outgrowth in N2a and PC12 cells. Taken together, our results identify the AICD as a novel inhibitory factor of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway and suggest its regulatory role in neuronal cell proliferation and differentiation.

Abstract: The synthesis and characterization of C60 derivatives with different thiophene units, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-(2′-thienyl)ethyl ester (PCBTE), [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-(2′,2″-bithiophene-5′-yl)ethyl ester (PCBBTE), and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid 2-(2′,2″:5″,2″′-terthiophene-5′-yl)ethyl ester (PCBTTE), have been investigated as surfactants for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells comprised of P3HT and PCBM. We found that these surfactants could reduce the interfacial energy to prevent domain coarsening and macrophase separation in an active layer depending on their contents, in which PCBTTE was the most effective surfactant among the derivatives. The device performance was enhanced in presence of 5% PCBTTE with optimized devices showing a power conversion efficiency of 4.37% under AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) illumination. In the P3HT/PCBM/PCBTTE ternary blends, the highest absorption coefficient was observed at the surfactant ratio of 5%, which led to an improvement in the JSC values. Additionally, the introduction of PCBTTE as a surfactant not only enhanced the power conversion efficiency of the solar cells, but also reduced the PCBM aggregation upon annealing, resulting in a better thermal stability. The compatibilizing effect could also be confirmed by DSC measurement revealing the different selective miscibility of P3HT and those C60 derivatives with different thiophene units. These results indicated the superior compatibilizing effect of the PCBTTE for organic solar cell applications.

Abstract: For growth factors, cytokines, G-protein-coupled receptors and numerous other stimuli, the Src Family of kinases (SFK) play a central signaling role. SFKs also play an important role in pancreatic acinar cell function including metabolism, secretion, endocytosis, growth and cytoskeletal integrity, although the specific SFKs involved are not fully known. In the present study we used specific antibodies for the SFK, Yes, to determine its presence, activation by pancreatic secretagogues or growth factors, and interaction with cellular signaling cascades mediated by CCK in which Yes participates in to cause acinar cell responses. Yes was identified in acini and secretagogues known to activate phospholipase C (PLC) [CCK, carbachol, bombesin] as well as post-receptor stimulants activating PKC [TPA] or mobilizing cellular calcium [thapsigargin/calcium ionophore (A23187)] each activated Yes. Secretin, which activates adenylate cyclase did not stimulate Yes, nor did pancreatic growth factors. CCK activation of Yes required both high- and low-affinity CCK1-receptor states. TPA-/CCK-stimulated Yes activation was completely inhibited by thapsigargin and the PKC inhibitor, GF109203X. CCK/TPA stimulated the association of Yes with focal adhesion kinases (Pyk2, FAK) and its autophosphorylated forms (pY397FAK, pY402Pyk2). Moreover, CCK/TPA stimulated Yes interacted with a number of other signaling proteins, including Shc, PKD, p130Cas, PI3K and PTEN. This study demonstrates that in rat pancreatic acini, the SFK member Yes is expressed and activated by CCK and other gastrointestinal hormones/neurotransmitters. Because its activation results in the direct activation of many cellular signaling cascades that have been shown to mediate CCK's effect in acinar cell function our results suggest that it is one of the important pancreatic SFKs mediating these effects.

Neutrophils augment LPS-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling in human lung epithelial cells,

Abstract: Background
The role of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in pulmonary host defense is well recognized. The influence of a pre-existing inflammation driven by neutrophils (neutrophilic inflammation) on the airway epithelial response toward pro-inflammatory exogenous triggers, however, is still poorly addressed. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of neutrophils on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells. Additionally, underlying signaling pathways are examined.
Methods
Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were co-incubated with human peripheral blood neutrophils or bone-marrow derived neutrophils from either C57BL/6J wild type or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase deficient (p47phox−/−) mice. Upon stimulation with LPS, interleukin (IL)-8 production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were measured. Additionally, activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 and nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathways was analyzed.
Results
Our studies show that the presence of neutrophils synergistically increases LPS-induced IL-8 and ROS production by BEAS-2B cells without inducing cytotoxicity. The observed IL-8 response to endotoxin increases in proportion to time, LPS-concentration and the number of neutrophils present. Moreover, this synergistic IL-8 production strongly correlated with the chemotactic properties of the co-incubations and significantly depended on a functional neutrophilic NADPH oxidase. The presence of neutrophils also augments LPS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and IκBα as well as NF-κB RelA DNA binding activity in BEAS-2B cells.
Conclusions
Our results indicate that the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS toward lung epithelial cells are amplified during a pre-existing neutrophilic inflammation. These findings support the concept that patients suffering from pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation are more susceptible toward exogenous pro-inflammatory triggers.

Abstract: Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is a major M-phase kinase which requires the binding to a regulatory protein, Cyclin B, to be active. CDK1/Cyclin B complex is called M-phase promoting factor (MPF) for its key role in controlling both meiotic and mitotic M-phase of the cell cycle. CDK1 inactivation is necessary for oocyte activation and initiation of embryo development. This complex process requires both Cyclin B polyubiquitination and proteosomal degradation via the ubiquitin-conjugation pathway, followed by the dephosphorylation of the monomeric CDK1 on Thr161. Previous proteomic analyses revealed a number of CDK1-associated proteins in human HeLa cells. It is, however, unknown whether specific partners are involved in CDK1 inactivation upon M-phase exit. To better understand CDK1 regulation during MII-arrest and oocyte activation, we immunoprecipitated (IPed) CDK1 together with its associated proteins from M-phase-arrested and M-phase-exiting Xenopus laevis oocytes. A mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed a number of new putative CDK1 partners. Most importantly, the composition of the CDK1-associated complex changed rapidly during M-phase exit. Additionally, an analysis of CDK1 complexes precipitated with beads covered with p9 protein, a fission yeast suc1 homologue well known for its high affinity for CDKs, was performed to identify the most abundant proteins associated with CDK1. The screen was auto-validated by identification of: (i) two forms of CDK1: Cdc2A and B, (ii) a set of Cyclins B with clearly diminishing number of peptides identified upon M-phase exit, (iii) a number of known CDK1 substrates (e.g. peroxiredoxine) and partners (e.g. HSPA8, a member of the HSP70 family) both in IP and in p9 precipitated pellets. In IP samples we also identified chaperones, which can modulate CDK1 three-dimensional structure, as well as calcineurin, a protein necessary for successful oocyte activation. These results shed a new light on CDK1 regulation via a dynamic change in the composition of the protein complex upon M-phase exit and the oocyte to embryo transition.

Abstract: In this work, we use different encapsulations to protect vacuum-evaporated small molecule organic solar cells with a simple p-i-i-stack for lifetime studies. Our devices use ZnPc and C60 as active materials. Lifetimes (T50) in a range from 300h for un-encapsulated devices to 4000h for glass-encapsulated have been observed. We use a model to distinguish between the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of the barrier and an additional WVTR of the aluminum top electrode. For all observed devices a loss of 50% of initial efficiency is observed when 10mgm−2 water entered the device. The losses are related to a reduction of short circuit current density only, whereas open circuit voltage and fill factor remains unaffected. We relate this to an interaction of the water molecules with C60.

Abstract: Null mutations in the pea3 allele compromise the capacity of mammary tumors to metastasize in MMTV-Neu/ErbB2/HER2 transgenic mice, indicating a motility defect in PEA3-null cells. Cellular and biochemical analyses of established PEA3-null fibroblasts show impaired motility and aberrant localization of adhesion proteins in spreading cells. Our results show that PEA3−/− cells express normal levels of key adhesion components, but that spreading PEA3-null cells fail to activate c-src and to downregulate phospho-FAK(Y397), suggesting that focal adhesion signaling is impaired. Supporting this, biochemical analysis revealed that adhesion complex-associated proteins such as p130Cas failed to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and dissociated from the adhesion complex with delayed kinetics. Overall our data show that the motility defects observed in PEA3-null cells are due to altered adhesion signaling.

Abstract: Dynamic ubiquitination impacts on the degradation of proteins by the proteasome as well as on their effects as signalling factors. Of the many cellular responses that are regulated by changes in ubiquitination, apoptosis has garnered special attention. We have found that USP2a and USP2c, two isoforms of the ubiquitin-specific protease USP2, cause cell death upon ectopic expression. We show that both USP2 isoforms can control the ubiquitination status of many proteins but from a panel of potential targets only the protein level of RIP1 was increased by these enzymes. This effect is responsible for the activity of USP2a and USP2c to cause cell death. Both enzymes likewise de-ubiquitinate TRAF2, a ubiquitin-ligase in the TNFR1 complex. Whilst this and the similar sub‐cellular localisations of both enzyme isoforms indicate a substantial overlap of activities, inactivation by RNAi revealed that only the knock-down of USP2c resulted in apoptosis, whilst targeting USP2a did not have any consequence on the cells' survival. Consequently, we focussed our studies on USP2a and found that TRAF2 inhibits USP2a's effect on K48- but not on K63-linked ubiquitin chains. Hence, the ratio between USP2a and TRAF2 protein levels determines the cells' sensitivity to cell death.

Abstract: Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a key-cytokine in osteoarthritis, impairs TGFβ signaling through TβRII down-regulation by increasing its degradation. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism that controls TßRII fate in IL-1ß treated cells. Chondrocytes were treated with IL-1ß in the presence of different inhibitors. TßRII and Cav-1 expression were assayed by Western blot and RT-PCR. We showed that IL-1ß-induced degradation of TßRII is dependent on proteasome and on its internalization in caveolae. In addition, IL-1ß enhances Cav-1 expression, a major constituent of lipid raft. In conclusion, we enlighten a new mechanism by which IL-1ß antagonizes TGFß pathway and propose a model of TßRII turnover regulation upon IL-1ß treatment.

Abstract: An electrochromic switchable mirror can be switched between reflective and transparent states by applying voltage. This device can potentially be applied in new energy-saving windows because its reflective state can effectively control incoming solar radiation. We previously evaluated the effects of environmental factors such as temperature and humidity on the optical switching properties of the device using a thermostat/humidistat bath to realize its practical applications. In this work, we focused on the effect of relative humidity in the atmosphere on the properties of the device. When the device was stored at 50°C and 80% relative humidity (RH) for 15 days, its surface became much rougher (Ra=23.2nm) as a result of the degradation of the Mg4Ni thin film on the surface. The degraded device showed no optical switching properties. On the other hand, when the device was stored at 50°C and 30% RH for 15 days, its surface was barely degraded and the device showed clear optical switching properties. These results suggest that not high temperature but rather high relative humidity in the atmosphere strongly affect the properties of the device, resulting in surface degradation. A protective coating layer using a fluorocarbon polymer was also developed to prevent the degradation of the device in the environment.

Abstract: Here in we present a study of the influence of Boron concentration upon the growth, and structural properties of hydrogenated nano and microcrystalline silicon thin films. The films were deposited in a RF plasma reactor using a mixture of silane and diborane as reactive gas, both highly diluted in hydrogen. The Boron concentration in the reactive gas was modified from 0 to 100ppm. Increased concentration of Boron induces a change in the amorphous–crystalline transition, showing an increase in the crystal volume fraction (Xc) of the samples with concentrations from 0–75ppm; whereas, there is a decrease of this parameter for the Boron concentration at 100ppm. This fact is related to amorphization of the material for higher doping concentrations. A grain type with columnar structure embedded in an amorphous matrix was observed via electron microscopy micrographs and SEM images. A correlation between morphological properties and defects in the material at the grain boundaries of the columnar grains were also studied.

Abstract: Prostacyclin and its I prostanoid receptor, the IP, play central roles in hemostasis and in re-endothelialization in response to vascular injury. Herein, intestinal and kidney enriched PDZ protein (IKEPP) was identified as an interactant of the human (h) IP mediated through binding of PDZ domain 1 (PDZD1) and, to a lesser extent, PDZD2 of IKEPP to a carboxyl-terminal Class I ‘PDZ ligand’ within the hIP. While the interaction is constitutive, agonist-activation of the hIP leads to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK) A and PKC‐phosphorylation of IKEPP, coinciding with its increased interaction with the hIP. Ectopic expression of IKEPP increases functional expression of the hIP, enhancing its ligand binding and agonist-induced cAMP generation. Originally thought to be restricted to renal and gastrointestinal tissues, herein, IKEPP was also found to be expressed in vascular endothelial cells where it co-localizes and complexes with the hIP. Furthermore, siRNA-disruption of IKEPP expression impaired hIP-induced endothelial cell migration and in vitro angiogenesis, revealing the functional importance of the IKEPP:IP interaction within the vascular endothelium. Identification of IKEPP as a functional interactant of the IP reveals novel mechanistic insights into the role of these proteins within the vasculature and, potentially, in other systems where they are co-expressed.

Abstract: We have studied microcrystalline silicon films (μc-Si:H:F) deposited by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) at low temperature (∼200°C) from SiF4, H2 and Ar gas mixtures. We found that the H2/SiF4 ratio plays an important role on the crystalline fraction of the films, specifically on the films grain size, deduced from UV–vis spectroscopic ellipsometry. We observed that higher crystallinity (and larger fraction of large-grains) in the films provides a higher absorption on the infrared (IR) region, which is of particular interest for tandem solar cells. PIN solar cells were fabricated with intrinsic μc-Si:H:F films of different crystallinity (and different fraction of large grains) in order to observe their effect on the solar cells IR absorption and on the cells performance characteristics.

Abstract: The wxAMPS program is an update of the popular solar cell simulation tool AMPS (Analysis of Microelectronic and Photonic Structures). The user interface of wxAMPS uses a cross-platform library and provides quick data entry and improved visualization. Beyond the original AMPS kernel, wxAMPS incorporates two tunneling models and a new algorithm combining the Newton and Gummel methods. The incorporation of a trap-assisted tunneling model makes more precise simulation of multi-junction solar cells possible. The combined Newton and Gummel method solutions improve stability of the code and permit both tunneling models to function well within the algorithm. Based on the option for an unlimited number of layers in the simulation, modeling graded solar cells can be implemented easily in wxAMPS.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is one of the leading gynecological malignancies in women. We have recently shown that seminal plasma (SP) can regulate the inflammatory cyclooxygenase-prostaglandin pathway and enhance the growth of cervical epithelial tumours in vivo by promoting cellular proliferation and alteration of vascular function. This study investigated the molecular mechanism whereby SP regulates vascular function using an in vitro model system of HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that SP rapidly enhanced the expression of the angiogenic chemokines, interleukin (IL)-8 and growth regulated oncogene alpha (GRO) in HeLa cells in a time-dependent manner. We investigated the molecular mechanism of SP-mediated regulation of IL-8 and GRO using a panel of chemical inhibitors of cell signalling. We found that treatment of HeLa cells with SP elevated expression of IL-8 and GRO by transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and induction of cyclooxygenase enzymes and nuclear factor kappa B. We investigated the impact of IL-8 and GRO, released from HeLa cells after treatment with SP, on vascular function using a co-culture model system of conditioned medium (CM) from HeLa cells, treated with or without SP, and HUVECs. We found that CM from HeLa cells induced the arrangement of endothelial cells into a network of tube-like structures via the CXCR2 receptor on HUVECs. Taken together our data outline a molecular mechanism whereby SP can alter vascular function in cervical cancers via the pro-angiogenic chemokines, IL-8 and GRO.

Abstract: Blood vessel formation depends on the highly coordinated actions of a variety of angiogenic regulators. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) are both potent and essential proangiogenic factors with complementary roles in vascular development and function. Whereas VEGF is required for the formation of the initial vascular plexus, Ang-1 contributes to the stabilization and maturation of growing blood vessels. Here, we provide evidence of a novel microRNA (miRNA)-dependent molecular mechanism of Ang-1 signalling modulation aimed at stabilizing adult vasculature. MiRNAs are short non-coding RNA molecules that post-trascriptionally regulate gene expression by translational suppression or in some instances by cleavage of the respective mRNA target. Our data indicate that endothelial cells of mature vessels express high levels of miR-126, which primarily targets phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 2 (p85β). Down-regulation of miR-126 and over-expression of p85β in endothelial cells inhibit the biological functions of Ang-1. Additionally, knockdown of miR-126 in zebrafish resulted in vascular remodelling and maturation defects, reminiscent of the Ang-1 loss-of-function phenotype. Our findings suggest that miR-126-mediated phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulation, not only fine-tunes VEGF-signaling, but it strongly enhances the activities of Ang-1 on vessel stabilization and maturation.

Abstract: The intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) is based on a novel photovoltaic concept and has a limiting efficiency of 63.2%, which compares favorably with the 40.7% efficiency of a conventional, single junction solar cell. It is characterized by a material hosting a collection of energy levels within its bandgap, allowing the cell to exploit photons with sub-bandgap energies in a two-step absorption process, thus improving the utilization of the solar spectrum. However, these intermediate levels are often regarded as an inherent source of supplementary recombination, although this harmful effect can in theory be counteracted by the use of concentrated light. We present here a novel, low-temperature characterization technique using concentrated light that reveals how the initially enhanced recombination in the IBSC is reduced so that its open-circuit voltage is completely recovered and reaches that of a conventional solar cell.

Abstract: The role of iron in oxidative injury in the nervous system has been extensively described. However, little is known about the role of lipid signal transduction in neurodegeneration processes triggered by iron overload. The purpose of this work was to characterize the regulation and the crosstalk between phosphatidylcholine (PC)-derived diacylglycerol (DAG) and cannonical signaling pathways during iron-induced oxidative stress in cerebral cortex synaptic endings (Syn) obtained from adult (4months old) and aged (28months old) rats. DAG production was increased in Syn exposed to iron. This rise in DAG formation was due to phospholipase D1 (PLD1) and PLD2 activations. In adult rats, PKD1, ERK1/2 and PKCα/βII activations were PLD1 and PLD2 dependent. In contrast, in senile rats, DAG formation catalyzed by PLDs did not participate in PKD1, ERK1/2 and PKCα/βII regulations, but it was dependent on ERK and PKC activities. Iron-induced oxidative stress promoted an increased localization of PLD1 in membrane rafts, whereas PLD2 was excluded from these domains and appeared to be involved in glutamate transporter function. Our results show a differential regulation and synaptic function of DAG generated by PLDs during iron-induced oxidative stress as a consequence of aging.

Abstract: Dysregulated growth and motility of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) play important role in obstructive vascular diseases. We previously reported that gene transfer of thymidine phosphorylase (TP) into rat VSMC inhibits cell proliferation and attenuates balloon injury induced neointimal hyperplasia; however, the mechanism remains unclear. The current study identified a signaling pathway that mediates effect of TP inhibited VSMC proliferation with a TP activity-dependent manner. Rat VSMC overexpressing human TP gene (C2) or control empty vector (PC) were used. Serum stimulation induced constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine705 in C2 cell but not in PC, which was independent of JAK2 signaling pathway. Inhibition of Src family kinases activity inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in C2 cells. Lyn activity was higher in C2 cell than in PC. SiRNA based gene knockdown of Lyn significantly decreased serum induced STAT3 phosphorylation in C2 and dramatically increased proliferation of this cell, suggesting that Lyn plays a pivotal role in TP inhibited VSMC proliferation. Unphosphorylated STAT3 (U-STAT3) expression was significantly increased in C2 cells, which may be due to the increased STAT3 transcription. Gene transfection of mouse wild‐type or Y705F mutant STAT3 into PC cell or mouse primary cultured VSMC significantly reduced proliferation of these cells, suggesting that overexpression of U-STAT3 inhibits VSMC proliferation. We conclude that Lyn mediates TP induced STAT3 activation, which subsequently contributes to upregulate expression of U-STAT3. The U-STAT3 plays a critical role in inhibiting VSMC proliferation.

Abstract: Connexin-43 (Cx43) is a membrane phosphoprotein that mediates direct inter-cellular communication by forming gap junctions. In this way Cx43 can influence gene expression, differentiation and growth. Its role in adipogenesis, however, is poorly understood. In this study, we established that Cx43 becomes highly phosphorylated in early adipocyte differentiation and translocates to the plasma membrane from the endoplasmic reticulum. As preadipocytes differentiate, Cx43 phosphorylation declines, the protein is displaced from the plasma membrane, and total cellular levels are reduced via proteosomal degradation. Notably, we show that inhibiting Cx43 degradation or constitutively over-expressing Cx43 blocks adipocyte differentiation. These data reveal that transient activation of Cx43 via phosphorylation followed by its degradation is vital for preadipocyte differentiation and maturation of functional adipocytes.

Abstract: Nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) thin films were prepared by reactive sputtering using H2O as a reactive gas, and the electrochromic (EC) properties of these thin films were investigated in alkaline, neutral, and acidic aqueous electrolyte solutions. A stable EC cycling of up to 100 cycles was obtained for the NiOOH thin films in electrolyte solutions with a wide pH range of 4.1–13.5. However, the EC cycling degraded drastically after several tens of cycles in an electrolyte with pH=2.0. In the stable pH region, the NiOOH films exhibited a large transmittance change from approximately 30–90%, although the response speed slowed with decreasing pH of the electrolytes.

Abstract: Selenoprotein W (SelW) contains a highly reactive selenocysteine (Sec; U) in the CXXU motif corresponding to the CXXC motif in thioredoxin (Trx) and thus it appears to be involved in regulating the cellular redox state. Recent reports on the interaction between SelW and 14-3-3 suggest that SelW may be redox dependently involved in the cell cycle. However, the precise function of SelW has not yet been elucidated. Here, we show that SelW is involved in the G2–M transition, especially in the recovery from G2 arrest after deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. Knockdown of SelW significantly accumulated phosphorylated cyclin‐dependent kinase (Cdk1), which eventually led to a delay in recovery from G2 arrest. We also found that inactive Cdk1 is caused by the sustained inactivation of CDC25B, which removes the inhibitory phosphate from Cdk1. Our observation from this study reveals that SelW activated CDC25B by promoting the dissociation of 14-3-3 from CDC25B through the reduction of the intramolecular disulfide bond during recovery. We suggest that SelW plays an important role in the recovery from G2 arrest by determining the dissociation of 14-3-3 from CDC25B in a redox-dependent manner.

Abstract: Sulforaphane (SFN) is a compound derived from cruciferous plants. Its anticancer properties have been demonstrated both, in cancer cell lines as well as tumors in animal models. It has been shown that SFN inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, autophagy, and sensitizes cancer cells to therapies. As induction of catabolic processes is often related to perturbation in protein synthesis we aimed to investigate the impact of SFN on this process in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. In the present study we show that SFN inhibits protein synthesis in PC-3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner which is accompanied by a decreased phosphorylation of mTOR substrates. Translation inhibition is independent of mitochondria‐derived ROS as it is observed in PC-3 derivatives devoid of functional mitochondrial respiratory chain (Rho0 cells). Although SFN affects mitochondria and slightly decreases glycolysis, the ATP level is maintained on the level characteristic for control cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis might be a protective response of prostate cancer cells to save energy. However, translation inhibition contributes to the death of PC-3 cells due to decreased level of a short-lived protein, survivin. Overexpression of this anti-apoptotic factor protects PC-3 cells against SFN cytotoxicity. Protein synthesis inhibition by SFN is not restricted to prostate cancer cells as we observed similar effect in SKBR-3 breast cancer cell line.

Abstract: Vanadium oxide nanocrystalline films were prepared by spin-coating from vanadium (V) oxoisopropoxide sol and thermally treated at 150°C, in order to deposit them on PET–ITO substrates. The sols were made from either isopropanol or its mixture with n-butanol, both exhibiting similar rheological behaviour and a viscosity of the order of magnitude of 10−3Pas. A cross-hatch test revealed the excellent adhesion of these films on the ITO surface and delamination occurred preferentially at the ITO–plastic interface when the films were subjected to deliberate bending. The electrochemical and optical properties of the vanadium oxide films were analysed using in-situ UV–vis absorbance spectroelectrochemistry. The response was correspondingly lower than with films deposited on FTO-glass. Ex-situ IR reflection–absorption spectroscopy showed that vanadyl V–OA and superimposed bridging V–OB–V and 3V–OC bands appear at lower frequencies compared to crystalline V2O5, due to the hydrated nanocrystalline structure. An intercalation induced red-shift of the vanadyl mode and the disappearance of the superimposed V–OB–V and 3V–OC bands, but the spectrum was restored to the initial situation after deintercalation. The modulation of polaron absorption that extends from the near to mid-IR spectral region up to 2000cm−1 was not visible due to transfer of the films from electrochemical cell to the IR spectrometer. The electrochromic properties of the vanadium oxide films deposited on PET–ITO substrate were tested in a liquid electrolyte-based cell with an electrochromically active PEDOT film and 1M LiClO4/propylene carbonate electrolyte.

Abstract: Control of the nanoscale morphology or microstructure of the active layer in hybrid solar cells is critical to ensure the high device performance. Here, a novel electron-donor material, liquid-crystalline polythiophene containing a cyano-biphenyl mesogenic pendant, poly[3-(6-(4-cynaobiphenyloxy)-hexyl) thiophene] (P3HbpT), was rationally designed and synthesized. The spontaneous orientation of cyano-biphenyl mesogen endowed the P3HbpT with a well ordered morphology and facilitated the homogeneous dispersion of ZnO nanoparticles in the composites. The P3HbpT/ZnO composite films exhibited a red-shift absorption (12nm), the lower LUMO and more ordered domains after undergoing annealing at liquid crystal (LC) states temperature (175°C), which indicated that the spontaneous assembly behavior of the liquid-crystalline polythiophene could induce the ZnO nanoparticles to form nano-dispersing structure with highly oriented channel layers upon heating at liquid crystalline states. Furthermore, the hybrid bulk-heterojunction devices based on P3HbpT/ZnO active layer have been constructed. Without extensive optimization, the devices undergoing annealing at LC state yielded a Voc of 0.83V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.61%, showing a significantly increased Jsc and FF with respect to the un-annealed counterpart.

Abstract: Envenoming with brown spiders (Loxosceles genus) is common throughout the world. Cutaneous symptoms following spider bite accidents include dermonecrosis, erythema, itching and pain. In some cases, accidents can cause hypersensibility or even allergic reactions. These responses could be associated with histaminergic events, such as an increase in vascular permeability and vasodilatation. A protein that may be related to the effects of spider venom was identified from a previously obtained cDNA library of the L. intermedia venom gland. The amino acid sequence of this protein is homologous to proteins from the TCTP (translationally-controlled tumor protein) family, which are extracellular histamine-releasing factors (HRF) that are associated with the allergic reactions to parasites. Herein, we described the cloning, heterologous expression, purification and functional characterization of a novel member of the TCTP family from the Loxosceles intermedia venom gland. This recombinant protein, named LiRecTCTP, causes edema, enhances vascular permeability and is likely related to the inflammatory activity of the venom. Moreover, LiRecTCTP presents an immunological relationship with mammalian TCTPs.

Abstract: Loss-of-function DJ-1 mutations have been linked to autosomal recessive early-onset Parikinsonism. However, the putative function of DJ-1 is not completely understood. Previous studies indicate that DJ-1 overexpression results in upregulation of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene. The mechanism by which DJ-1 affects tyrosine hydroxylase expression remains elusive. In the present study, we show that DJ-1 overexpression induces ERK1/2 activation, along with increased tyrosine hydroxylase expression. The L166P DJ-1 mutant, which has been identified as being responsible for familial Parkinsonism, did not have this effect. Moreover, suppression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by the pharmacological inhibitor U0126 partially abolished the regulating effect of DJ-1 on tyrosine hydroxylase. Nurr1, a transcriptional factor for tyrosine hydroxylase, can be phosphorylated by ERK1/2 and translocate to the nucleus, where it is activated. Thus, we measured nuclear translocation of Nurr1. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting revealed that Nurr1 translocated to the nucleus and was activated by overexpression of wild-type DJ-1, but not of its L166P mutant. Knockdown of Nurr1 gene expression abolished the effect on tyrosine hydroxylase induced by DJ-1. Taken together, these data suggest that DJ-1 upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase expression by activating its transcription factor Nurr1 via the ERK1/2 pathway.

Abstract: We have generated mouse transgenic lineages for C3G (tgC3G) and C3GΔCat (tgC3GΔCat, C3G mutant lacking the GEF domain), where the transgenes are expressed under the control of the megakaryocyte and platelet specific PF4 (platelet factor 4) gene promoter. Transgenic platelet activity has been analyzed through in vivo and in vitro approaches, including bleeding time, aggregation assays and flow cytometry. Both transgenes are expressed (RNA and protein) in purified platelets and megakaryocytes and do not modify the number of platelets in peripheral blood. Transgenic C3G animals showed bleeding times significantly shorter than control animals, while tgC3GΔCat mice presented a remarkable bleeding diathesis as compared to their control siblings. Accordingly, platelets from tgC3G mice showed stronger activation in response to platelet agonists such as thrombin, PMA, ADP or collagen than control platelets, while those from tgC3GΔCat animals had a lower response. In addition, we present data indicating that C3G is a mediator in the PKC pathway leading to Rap1 activation. Remarkably, a significant percentage of tgC3G mice presented a higher level of neutrophils than their control siblings. These results indicate that C3G plays an important role in platelet clotting through a mechanism involving its GEF activity and suggest that it might be also involved in neutrophil development.

Abstract: Covalent conjugation of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to proteins is a highly dynamic and reversible process. Cells maintain a fine-tuned balance between SUMO conjugation and deconjugation. In response to stress stimuli such as heat shock, this balance is altered resulting in a dramatic increase in the levels of SUMO conjugates. Whether this reflects an activation of the conjugation cascade, a decrease in the activity of SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs), or both, remains unknown. Here, we show that from the five human SENPs detected in HeLa cells (SENP1/2/3/6/7) the activities of all but one (SENP6) were largely diminished after 30min of heat shock. The decreased activity is not due to changes in their steady-state levels. Rather, in vitro experiments suggest that these SENPs are intrinsically heat-sensitive, a property most likely emerging from their catalytic domains. Heat shock inactivation seems to be a specific property of SENPs because numerous members of the related deubiquitinase family of cysteine proteases are not affected by this stress condition. Overall, our results suggest that SENPs are particularly sensitive to heat shock, a property that may be important for the adaptation of cells to this stress condition.

Abstract: The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) plays an essential role in double-strand break repair by initially recognizing and binding to DNA breaks. Here, we show that DNA-PKcs interacts with the regulatory γ1 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a heterotrimeric enzyme that has been proposed to function as a “fuel gauge” to monitor changes in the energy status of cells and is controlled by the upstream kinases LKB1 and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK). In co-immunoprecipitation analyses, DNA-PKcs and AMPKγ1 interacted physically in DNA-PKcs-proficient M059K cells but not in DNA-PKcs-deficient M059J cells. Glucose deprivation-stimulated phosphorylation of AMPKα on Thr172 and of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK, is substantially reduced in M059J cells compared with M059K cells. The inhibition or down-regulation of DNA-PKcs by the DNA-PKcs inhibitors, wortmannin and Nu7441, or by DNA-PKcs siRNA caused a marked reduction in AMPK phosphorylation, AMPK activity, and ACC phosphorylation in response to glucose depletion in M059K, WI38, and IMR90 cells. In addition, DNA–DNA-PKcs−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited decreased AMPK activation in response to glucose-free conditions. Furthermore, the knockdown of DNA-PKcs led to the suppression of AMPK (Thr172) phosphorylation in LKB1-deficient HeLa cells under glucose deprivation. Taken together, these findings support the positive regulation of AMPK activation by DNA-PKcs under glucose-deprived conditions in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Endocytosis is pivotal for uptake of fibrinogen from plasma into megakaryocytes and platelet α-granules. Due to the complex adaptor and cargo contents in endocytic vehicles, the underlying mechanism of fibrinogen uptake is not yet completely elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether the endocytic adaptor protein Disabled-2 (DAB2) mediates fibrinogen uptake in an adaptor-specific manner. By employing primary megakaryocytes and megakaryocytic differentiating human leukemic K562 cells as the study models, we found that fibrinogen uptake is associated with the expression of integrin αIIbβ3 and DAB2 and is mediated through clathrin-dependent manner. Accordingly, constitutive and inducible knockdown of DAB2 by small interfering RNA reduced fibrinogen uptake for 53.2±9.8% and 59.0±10.7%, respectively. Culturing the cells in hypertonic solution or in the presence of clathrin inhibitor chlorpromazine abrogated clathrin-dependent endocytosis and diminished the uptake of fibrinogen. Consistent with these findings, 72.2±0.2% of cellular DAB2 was colocalized with clathrin, whereas 56.4±4.1% and 54.6±2.0% of the internalized fibrinogen were colocalized with clathrin and DAB2, respectively. To delineate whether DAB2 mediates fibrinogen uptake in an adaptor-specific manner, K562 stable cell lines with knockdown of the adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) or double knockdown of AP-2/DAB2 were established. The AP-2 knockdown cells elicited normal fibrinogen uptake activity but the uptake of collagen was diminished. In addition, collagen uptake was further reduced in DAB2/AP-2 knockdown cells. These findings thereby define an adaptor-specific mechanism in the control of fibrinogen uptake and implicate that DAB2 is the key adaptor in the clathrin-associated endocytic complexes to mediate fibrinogen internalization.

Abstract: Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1), a member of the BI-1 family of integral membrane proteins, was originally identified as an inhibitor of stress-induced cell death in mammalian cells. Previous studies have shown that the withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) results in differentiation of the majority of mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells into various cell lineages, while some ES cells die within 3days. Thus, to investigate the function of BI-1 in ES cell survival and neuronal differentiation, we generated mES cell lines that overexpress BI-1 or a carboxy-terminal BI-1ΔC mutant. Overexpression of BI-1 in mES cells significantly increased cell viability and resistance to apoptosis induced by LIF withdrawal, while the control vector or BI-1ΔC-overexpressing mES cells had no effect. Moreover, overexpression of BI-1 produced significant inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway in response to LIF withdrawal, while activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK pathway was increased. Interestingly, we found that BI-1-overexpressing cells showed higher expression levels of neuroectodermal markers (Otx1, Lmx1b, En1, Pax2, Wnt1, Sox1, and Nestin) and greater neuronal differentiation efficiency than control or BI-1ΔC-overexpressing mES cells did. Considering these findings, our results indicated that BI-1-modulated MAPK activity plays a key role in protecting mES cells from LIF-withdrawal-induced apoptosis and in promoting their differentiation toward neuronal lineages.

Abstract: An innovative concept of solution type photovoltaic electrochromic (PV-EC) device has been developed. The device includes a semi-transparent silicon thin-film solar cell (Si-TFSC) substrate, an electrochromic solution, and a transparent non-conductive substrate, wherein the electrochromic solution is located between the transparent non-conductive substrate and the Si-TFSC substrate. The solution type PV-EC device has at least the following advantages: (1) the electrodes in the PV-EC device are planarly distributed in the whole semi-transparent Si-TFSC substrate to create a uniform electric field, which makes large area PV-EC module application feasible; (2) since the PV-EC device can be driven with low voltage and low current, the demand for photopotential and photocurrent produced by the Si-TFSCs is lowered and thus the thickness of an intrinsic layer in each of the Si-TFSCs can be thinned, which increases the transmittance of the device, and (3) the electrical power generated by the PV-EC module can be controlled by an additional output switch layout coupled with the Si-TFSC. When illuminated by sunlight, a portion of electronic current produced by a Si-TFSC is converted into ionic current to cause color changing of the PV-EC device, while the monolithically integrated Si-TFSC module generates electricity to a connected load. In view of photoelectric conversion and optical modulation properties, the PV-EC device can both function as solar cell module and as self-powered smart glass, which has great advantages in green energy application.

Abstract: Neuroblastoma Differentiation Marker 29 (NDM29) is a RNA polymerase (pol) III-transcribed non-coding (nc) RNA whose synthesis drives neuroblastoma (NB) cell differentiation to a nonmalignant neuron-like phenotype. Since in this process a complex pattern of molecular changes is associated to plasma membrane protein repertoire we hypothesized that the expression of NDM29 might influence also key players of neurodegenerative pathways. In this work we show that the NDM29-dependent cell maturation induces amyloid precursor protein (APP) synthesis, leading to the increase of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) secretion and the concomitant increment of Aβ x-42/Aβ x-40 ratio. We also demonstrate that the expression of NDM29 RNA, and the consequent increase of Aβ formation, can be promoted by inflammatory stimuli (and repressed by anti-inflammatory drugs). Moreover, NDM29 expression was detected in normal human brains although an abnormal increased synthesis of this ncRNA is induced in patients affected by neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the complex of events triggered by NDM29 expression induces a condition that favors the formation of Aβ peptides in the extracellular space, as it may occur in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In addition, these data unexpectedly show that a pol III-dependent small RNA can act as key regulator of brain physiology and/or pathology suggesting that a better knowledge of this portion of the human transcriptome might provide hints for neurodegeneration studies.

Abstract: We have fabricated solar cells with layers of co-sputtered silicon and silicon dioxide. The diode structures were fabricated by sputtering alternating layers of SiO2 and silicon rich oxide onto quartz substrates with in-situ boron, for p-type, and phosphorus, for n-type, doping. After crystallization at 1100°C, isolated Si-nanocrystals are formed. The thin film layers containing these crystals act as n-type or p-type semiconductors as determined from CV measurements on MOS structures. The dark and illuminated I–Vs of the fabricated diodes show a rectifying behavior with an open circuit voltage of 492mV under a simulated 1.5AMD illumination. A circuit model is proposed to explain the observed I–V characteristics.

Abstract: The regulation and maintenance of the paracellular transport in renal tubular epithelia is vital for kidney functions. Combination of the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporine A (CsA) and sirolimus (SRL) exerts powerful immunosuppression, but also causes nephrotoxicity. We have previously shown that CsA and SRL elevate transepithelial resistance (TER) in kidney tubular cells partly through MEK/ERK1/2. In this work we examined the hypothesis that the RhoA pathway may also be mediating effects of CsA and SRL. We show that CsA and the CsA/SRL combination activated RhoA, induced cofilin phosphorylation and promoted stress fiber generation. The Rho kinase (ROK) inhibitor, Y27632, prevented CsA and CsA/SRL-induced cofilin phosphorylation and actin remodelling, reduced the TER increase and prevented the rise in claudin-7 levels caused by the drugs. Expression of the exchange factor GEF-H1/lfc was elevated in cells treated with CsA and CsA/SRL. GEF-H1 silencing inhibited RhoA activation by ≈50%, and potently reduced cofilin phosphorylation and stress fiber formation induced by CsA and CsA/SRL. However, GEF-H1 downregulation did not prevent the TER change. Thus the Rho/Rho kinase pathway was involved in mediating CsA and CsA/SRL-induced cytoskeleton rearrangement and TER changes via claudin-7 expression. Our data however point to differential regulation of Rho activation involved in central cytoskeleton remodelling, that is GEF-H1-dependent and junctional permeability that does not require GEF-H1.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to identify the role of phospholipase D (PLD) isozymes in Bcl-2 expression. Overexpression of PLD1 or PLD2 increased Bcl-2 expression and phosphatidic acid (PA), the product of PLDs, also upregulated Bcl-2 expression. Treatment with PA activated the phospholipase A2 (PLA2)/Gi/ERK1/2, RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK)/p38 MAPK, and Rac1/p38 MAPK pathways. PA-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was attenuated by a PLA2 inhibitor (mepacrine) and, a Gi protein inhibitor (pertussis toxin, PTX). On the other hand, p38 MAPK phosphorylation was attenuated by a dominant negative Rac1 and a specific Rho-kinase inhibitor (Y-27632). These results suggest that PLA2/Gi acts at the upstream of ERK1/2, while Rac1 and RhoA/ROCK act upstream of p38 MAPK. We next, tried to determine which transcription factor is involved in PLD-related Bcl-2 expression. When signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activity was blocked by a STAT3 specific siRNA, PA-induced Bcl-2 expression was remarkably decreased, suggesting that STAT3 is an essential transcription factor linking PLD to Bcl-2 upregulation. Taken together, these findings indicate that PLD acts as an important regulator in Bcl-2 expression by activating STAT3 involving the phosphorylation of Ser727 through the PLA2/Gi/ERK1/2, RhoA/ROCK/p38 MAPK, and Rac1/p38 MAPK pathways.

Abstract: Substrate ubiquitylation is a reversible process critical to cellular homeostasis that is often dysregulated in many human pathologies including cancer and neurodegeneration. Elucidating the mechanistic details of this pathway could unlock a large store of information useful to the design of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Proteomic approaches to the questions at hand have generally utilized mass spectrometry (MS), which has been successful in identifying both ubiquitylation substrates and profiling pan-cellular chain linkages, but is generally unable to connect the two. Interacting partners of the deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) have also been reported by MS, although substrates of catalytically competent DUBs generally cannot be. Where they have been used towards the study of ubiquitylation, protein microarrays have usually functioned as platforms for the identification of substrates for specific E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here, we report on the first use of protein microarrays to identify substrates of DUBs, and in so doing demonstrate the first example of microarray proteomics involving multiple (i.e., distinct, sequential and opposing) enzymatic activities. This technique demonstrates the selectivity of DUBs for both substrate and type (mono- versus poly-) of ubiquitylation. This work shows that the vast majority of DUBs are monoubiquitylated in vitro, and are incapable of removing this modification from themselves. This work also underscores the critical role of utilizing both ubiquitin chains and substrates when attempting to characterize DUBs. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Ubiquitin Drug Discovery and Diagnostics.

Abstract: Cardiac fibrosis is marked by increased deposition of extracellular matrix components including fibrillar collagens, leading to impaired cardiac contractility and function. We recently demonstrated that the transcription factor scleraxis is expressed in collagen-producing cardiac fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, is up-regulated in the collagen-rich scar following myocardial infarction and is sufficient to transactivate the human collagen 1α2 (COL1A2) gene, suggesting a central role in fibrosis. Here we describe the mechanism of scleraxis-mediated regulation of the COL1A2 promoter. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation in primary human cardiac fibroblasts in combination with luciferase assays, we demonstrate that two E box sequences within the proximal COL1A2 promoter are required for scleraxis-mediated transactivation. Expression of scleraxis itself was induced by receptor Smad3, an effector of the pro-fibrotic growth factor TGF-β1, and attenuated by inhibitory Smad7. TGF-β1 augmented the effect of scleraxis on COL1A2 transactivation, an effect which was due to synergy between scleraxis and Smad3. Mutation of the COL1A2 Smad-binding element significantly attenuated the ability of scleraxis to transactivate the promoter, while mutation of the scleraxis-interacting E boxes attenuated the effect of Smad3, suggesting that these factors form a common signaling complex at the promoter. COL1A2 promoter transactivation and Col1α2 gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts were completely abrogated by a scleraxis basic domain deletion mutant in a dominant negative fashion, blocking the ability of TGF-β1 to activate collagen synthesis and suggesting that scleraxis–DNA interaction is absolutely required for this process. Scleraxis thus appears to play a key role in the transcriptional regulation of type I collagen synthesis.

Abstract: Poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) tethered polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS-PSS) was synthesized and used as star-like dopant for the preparation of core–shell polyaniline/POSS-PSS (PANI/POSS-PSS) nanoparticles. The prepared aqueous emulsion shows good processibility and high stability. The electrochemical characteristics and electrochromic properties of PANI/POSS-PSS were studied. In comparison with polyaniline (PANI) doped with linear PSS dopant, the star-like POSS-PSS dopant renders PANI/POSS-PSS-based electrochromic device higher optical contrast and faster switching speed owing to the faster ion transportation resulting from the porous morphology of PANI/POSS-PSS.

Abstract: The T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase is expressed as two splice variants — TC45, a nuclear protein, and TC48, which is localized predominantly in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum). Yeast two-hybrid screening revealed direct interaction of TC48 with Syntaxin17, a SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein localized predominantly in the ER and to some extent in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. Syntaxin 17 did not interact with TC45. C-terminal 40 amino acids of TC48 were sufficient for interaction with syntaxin 17. Overexpressed syntaxin 17 was phosphorylated at tyrosine upon pervanadate treatment (a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor/tyrosine kinase activator) of COS-1 cells. Mutational analysis identified Tyr156 in the cytoplasmic domain as the major site of phosphorylation. Endogenous syntaxin 17 was phosphorylated by pervanadate treatment in CHO and MIN6 cells but was not phosphorylated in a variety of other cell lines tested. c-Abl was identified as one of the kinases, which phosphorylates syntaxin 17 in MIN6 cells. Phosphorylation of endogenous and overexpressed syntaxin 17 was reduced in the presence of IGF receptor and EGF receptor kinase inhibitors. Serum depletion reduced pervanadate-induced phosphorylation of endogenous syntaxin 17. TC48 coexpression reduced phosphorylation of syntaxin 17 by pervanadate and purified TC48 directly dephosphorylated syntaxin 17. β-COP dispersal by overexpressed syntaxin 17 was reduced after pervanadate-induced phosphorylation. A phospho-mimicking mutant (Y156E) of syntaxin 17 showed reduced interaction with COPI vesicles. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of syntaxin 17 is likely to have a role in regulating syntaxin 17 dependent membrane trafficking in the early secretory pathway.

Abstract: A critical risk factor in colorectal carcinogenesis and tumor therapy is the resistance to the apoptotic effects of different compounds from the intestinal lumen, among them butyrate (main regulator of colonic epithelium homeostasis). Insensitivity to butyrate-induced apoptosis yields resistance to other agents, as bile acids or chemotherapy drugs, allowing the selective growth of malignant cell subpopulations. Here we analyze bile acid-induced apoptosis in a butyrate-resistant human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (BCS-TC2.BR2) to determine the mechanisms that underlay the resistance to these agents in comparison with their parental butyrate-sensitive BCS-TC2 cells. This study demonstrates that DCA and CDCA still induce apoptosis in butyrate-resistant cells through increased ROS production by activation of membrane-associated enzymes and subsequent triggering of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Although this mechanism is similar to that described in butyrate-sensitive cells, cell viability is significantly higher in resistant cells. Moreover, butyrate-resistant cells show higher Bcl‐2 levels that confer resistance to bile acid-induced apoptosis sequestering Bax and avoiding Bax-dependent pore formation in the mitochondria. We have confirmed that this resistance is reverted using the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-263, thus demonstrating that the lower sensitivity of butyrate-resistant cells to the apoptotic effects of bile acids is mainly due to increased Bcl-2 levels.

Abstract: Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a hypophysiotropic neurohormone, participates in the regulation of pleiotropic functions. The recent discovery of intracellular PACAP receptors in the brain and the testis as well as the physico-chemical characteristics of PACAP, i.e. extended α-helix containing basic residues, prompted us to evaluate the propensity of PACAP to cross the plasma membrane in a receptor-independent manner. Using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we demonstrated the ability of FITC-conjugated PACAP to efficiently penetrate into the internal cell compartment by direct translocation and endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits and macropinocytosis. Our study also revealed that, once inside the cells, PACAP38 is not entirely degraded by intracellular enzymes and that a significant amount of intact PACAP38 is also able to exit cells. Moreover, using binding assay on rat nuclear fractions from various tissues, PACAP nuclear receptors were identified. We also found that PACAP stimulates calcium release in rat testis nuclei. Interestingly, PACAP27 and PACAP38 but not VIP were able to upregulate de novo DNA synthesis in testis nuclei and that this effect was abolished by PACAP(6–38). These results support the presence of PAC1 receptors at the nuclear membrane and raise questions about their role in the biological activity of the peptide. These findings contribute to the characterization of PACAP as an intracrine factor and suggest that these intracellular PAC1 binding sites, probably associated with specific biological activities, should be taken into account during the development of PACAP-based drugs.

Abstract: Clear renal cell carcinoma (cRCC) is an aggressive and fatal neoplasm. The present work was undertaken to investigate the antiproliferative potential of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) exposure on non-tumoral (HK2) and tumoral (A498, cRCC) human proximal tubular epithelial cell lines. Reverse transcription and semiquantitative PCR was used at the VIP mRNA level whereas enzyme immunoanalysis was performed at the protein level. Both renal cell lines expressed VIP as well as VIP/pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (VPAC) receptors whereas only HK2 cells expressed formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL-1). Receptors were functional, as shown by VIP stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Treatment with 0.1μM VIP (24h) inhibited proliferation of A498 but not HK2 cells as based on a reduction in the incorporation of [3H]-thymidine and BrdU (5′‐Br‐2′‐deoxyuridine), PCNA (proliferating‐cell nuclear antigen) expression and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) expression and activation. VPAC1-receptor participation was established using JV-1-53 antagonist and siRNA transfection. Growth-inhibitory response to VIP was related to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC)/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) signaling systems as shown by studies on adenylate cyclase stimulation, and using the EPAC-specific compound 8CPT-2Me-cAMP and specific kinase inhibitors such as H89, wortmannin and PD98059. The efficacy of VIP on the prevention of tumor progression was confirmed in vivo using xenografted athymic mouse. These actions support a potential role of this peptide and its agonists in new therapies for cRCC.

Abstract: Leukotriene B4, an arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediator, is a known proinflammatory agent that has a direct effect upon neutrophil physiology, inducing reactive oxygen species generation by the NADPH oxidase complex and impairing neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis, which in turn may corroborate to the onset of chronic inflammation. Despite those facts, a direct link between inhibition of neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis and NADPH oxidase activation by leukotriene B4 has not been addressed so far. In this study, we aim to elucidate the putative role of NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species in leukotriene B4-induced anti-apoptotic effect. Our results indicate that NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species are critical to leukotriene B4 pro-survival effect on neutrophils. This effect also relies on redox modulation of nuclear factor kappaB signaling pathway. We have also observed that LTB4-induced Bad degradation and mitochondrial stability require NADPH oxidase activity. All together, our results strongly suggest that LTB4-induced anti-apoptotic effect in neutrophils occurs in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner. We do believe that a better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis may contribute to the development of more successful strategies to control chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Abstract: Caspase-8 (CASP8) is a cysteine protease that plays a pivotal role in the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway via death receptors. The kinetics, dynamics, and selectivity with which the pathway transmits apoptotic signals to downstream molecules upon CASP8 activation are not fully understood. We have developed a system for using high-sensitivity FRET-based biosensors to monitor the protease activity of CASP8 and its downstream effector, caspase-3, in living single cells. Using this system, we systematically investigated the caspase cascade by regulating the magnitude of extrinsic signals received by the cell. Furthermore, we determined the molar concentration of five caspases and Bid required for hierarchical transmission of apoptotic signals in a HeLa cell. Based on these quantitative experimental data, we validated a mathematical model suitable for estimation of the kinetics and dynamics of caspases, which predicts the minimal concentration of CASP8 required to act as an initiator. Consequently, we found that less than 1% of the total CASP8 proteins are sufficient to set the apoptotic program in motion if activated. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the precise cascade of CASP8-mediated apoptotic signals through the extrinsic pathway.

Abstract: A novel electron-withdrawing group 5-(2,6-dimethyl-4H-pyran-4-ylidene)-1,3-diethyl-2-thioxo-dihydropyrimidine-4,6(1H,5H)-dione (PD) was designed and synthesized according to Knoevenagel condensation. On this basis, a small molecule 8TPDC8 with oligothiophene as electron-donating unit and PD as electron-accepting unit was designed and synthesized. UV–vis absorption spectrum displayed that 8TPDC8 possesses a relatively broad absorption range (from 300 to 900nm). The cyclic voltammetry investigation displayed that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of 8TPDC8 was −5.28eV, which promised good air stability and high open circuit voltage (Voc) for photovoltaic application. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices were fabricated with 8TPDC8 as the donor material and (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the acceptor material. A power conversion efficiency of 1.28% has been obtained under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100mW/cm2.

Abstract: Cancer cells exhibit an endogenous constitutive oxidative stress higher than that of normal cells, which renders tumours vulnerable to further reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) can mitigate oxidative stress by increasing the influx of protons into the mitochondrial matrix and reducing electron leakage and mitochondrial superoxide generation. Here, we demonstrate that chemical uncouplers or UCP2 over-expression strongly decrease mitochondrial superoxide induction by the anticancer drug gemcitabine (GEM) and protect cancer cells from GEM-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we show that GEM IC50 values well correlate with the endogenous level of UCP2 mRNA, suggesting a critical role for mitochondrial uncoupling in GEM resistance. Interestingly, GEM treatment stimulates UCP2 mRNA expression suggesting that mitochondrial uncoupling could have a role also in the acquired resistance to GEM. Conversely, UCP2 inhibition by genipin or UCP2 mRNA silencing strongly enhances GEM-induced mitochondrial superoxide generation and apoptosis, synergistically inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. These events are significantly reduced by the addition of the radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine or MnSOD over-expression, demonstrating a critical role of the oxidative stress. Normal primary fibroblasts are much less sensitive to GEM/genipin combination. Our results demonstrate for the first time that UCP2 has a role in cancer cell resistance to GEM supporting the development of an anti-cancer therapy based on UCP2 inhibition associated to GEM treatment.

Abstract: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cAMP/pKA pathway plays a major role in metabolism, stress resistance and proliferation control. cAMP is produced by adenylate cyclase, which is activated both by Gpr1/Gpa2 system and Ras proteins, regulated by Cdc25/Sdc25 guanine exchange factors and Ira GTPase activator proteins. Recently, both Ras2 and Cdc25 RasGEF were reported to localize not only in plasma membrane but also in internal membranes. Here, the subcellular localization of Ras signaling complex proteins was investigated both by fluorescent tagging and by biochemical cell membrane fractionation on sucrose gradients. Although a consistent minor fraction of Ras signaling complex components was found in plasma membrane during exponential growth on glucose, Cdc25 appears to localize mainly on ER membranes, while Ira2 and Cyr1 are also significantly present on mitochondria. Moreover, PKA Tpk1 catalytic subunit overexpression induces Ira2 protein to move from mitochondria to ER membranes. These data confirm the hypothesis that different branches of Ras signaling pathways could involve different subcellular compartments, and that relocalization of Ras signaling complex components is subject to PKA control.

Abstract: A series of porphyrins and N-confused porphyrins have been prepared in which the peripheral groups on the porphyrins are kept constant and the porphyrinoids differ only in their electronic nature. The materials have been blended into the active layer of MEH-PPV:PCBM bulk heterojunction solar cells and the performance of the cells is reported and discussed. All of the added porphyrinoids contribute to the photocurrent of the resultant solar cells and result in a broadening of the spectral response of the cells in accordance with the absorption spectra of the porphyrinoid. The efficiency of these devices is shown to correlate strongly with the ionisation potential (IP), and thus highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, of the added porphyrinoid. We argue that the relative energy of the HOMO levels of the porphyrinoids and the hole transporting polymer in these devices, coupled with the poor charge mobilities of N-confused porphyrins combine to generate porphyrinoid-based hole traps in these devices. This increases recombination within these devices, lowering both the devices' charge densities and open circuit voltages and resulting in reduced cell efficiencies. We show that varying the porphyrinoid added, by metallation or N-alkylation of the N-confused porphyrin, allows us to systematically change the IP of the species and directly affect the power conversion efficiency of the resultant device. The implications of this work for optimising the performance of ternary blend bulk heterojunction solar cells are discussed.

Abstract: In the thyroid, cAMP controls both thyroid growth and function. Gain-of-function mutations in the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) lead to constitutive cAMP formation and are a major cause of autonomous thyroid adenomas. The impact of activating TSHR mutations on the signal transduction network of the thyrocyte is not fully understood. To gain more insights into constitutive TSHR signaling, rat thyrocytes (FRTL-5 cells) with stable expression of three activating TSHR mutants (mutTSHR: A623I, L629F and Del613-621), which differ in their functional characteristics in vitro, were analyzed by a quantitative proteomic approach and compared to the wild-type TSHR (WT-TSHR). This study revealed (1) differences in the expression of Rab proteins suggesting an increased TSHR internalization in mutTSHR but not in the WT-TSHR; (2) differential stimulation of PI3K/Akt signaling in mutTSHR vs. WT-TSHR cells, (3) activation of Epac, impairing short-time Akt phosphorylation in both, mutTSHR and WT-TSHR cells. Based on the analysis of global changes in protein expression patterns, our findings underline the complexity of gain-of-function TSHR signaling in thyrocytes, which extends beyond pure cAMP and/or IP formation. Moreover, evidence for augmented endocytosis in the mutTSHR, adds to a new concept of TSHR signaling in thyroid autonomy. Further studies are required to clarify whether the observed differences in Rab, PI3K and Epac signaling may contribute to differences in the phenotypic presentation, i.e. stimulation of function and growth of thyroid autonomy in vivo.

Abstract: Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to apoptosis, aging, cancer, and a number of neurodegenerative and muscular disorders. The interplay between mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria ensuring mitochondrial quality control. An open question is what role mitochondrial fission plays in the removal of mitochondria after mild and transient oxidative stress; conditions reported to result in moderately elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels comparable to physical activity. Here we show that applying such conditions led to fragmentation of mitochondria and induction of mitophagy in mouse and human cells. These conditions increased ROS levels only slightly and neither triggered cell death nor led to a detectable induction of non-selective autophagy. Starvation led to hyperfusion of mitochondria, to high ROS levels, and to the induction of both non-selective autophagy and to a lesser extent to mitophagy. We conclude that moderate levels of ROS specifically trigger mitophagy but are insufficient to trigger non-selective autophagy. Expression of a dominant-negative variant of the fission factor DRP1 blocked mitophagy induction by mild oxidative stress as well as by starvation. Taken together, we demonstrate that in mammalian cells under mild oxidative stress a DRP1-dependent type of mitophagy is triggered while a concomitant induction of non-selective autophagy was not observed. We propose that these mild oxidative conditions resembling well physiological situations are thus very helpful for studying the molecular pathways governing the selective removal of dysfunctional mitochondria.

ERK1/2-dependent bestrophin-3 expression prevents ER-stress-induced cell death in renal epithelial cells by reducing CHOP,

Abstract: Upon endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induction, cells endeavor to survive by engaging the adaptive stress response known as the unfolded protein response or by removing aggregated proteins via autophagy. Chronic ER stress culminates in apoptotic cell death, which involves induction of pro-apoptotic CHOP. Here, we show that bestrophin-3 (Best-3), a protein previously associated with Ca2+-activated Cl− channel activity, is upregulated by the ER stressors, thapsigargin (TG), tunicamycin (TUN) and the toxic metal Cd2+. In cultured rat kidney proximal tubule cells, ER stress, CHOP and cell death were induced after 6h by Cd2+ (25μM), TG (3μM) and TUN (6μM), were associated with increased cytosolic Ca2+ and downstream formation of reactive oxygen species and attenuated by the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (10μM), the antioxidant α-tocopherol (100μM), or overexpression of catalase (CAT). Immunofluorescence staining showed Best-3 expression in the plasma membrane, nuclei and intracellular compartments, though not in the ER, in cultured cells and rat kidney cortex sections. Best-3 mRNA was augmented by ER stress and signaled through increased Ca2+, oxidative stress and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, because it was attenuated by α-tocopherol, CAT expression, BAPTA-AM, calmodulin kinase inhibitor calmidazolium (40μM), ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (10μM), and ERK1/2 RNAi. Knockdown of Best-3 resulted in decreased cell number consequentially of cell death, as determined by nuclear staining and PARP-1 cleavage. Furthermore, reduced ER stress-cell death by Best-3 overexpression is attributed to diminished CHOP. Since Best-3 overexpression did not affect upstream signaling pathways, we hypothesize that Best-3 possibly interferes with CHOP transcription. From our novel observations, we conclude that ERK1/2-dependent Best-3 activation regulates cell fate decisions during ER stress by suppressing CHOP induction and death.

Abstract: Heterotrimeric G proteins (Gα, Gβ, Gγ) play important roles in signal transduction among various eukaryotic species. G proteins transmit signals by regulating the activities of effector proteins, but only a few Gβ-interacting effectors have been identified in plants. Here we show by a yeast two-hybrid screen that a putative myristoylated 2C-type protein phosphatase, PP2C52, is an Arabidopsis Gβ (AGB1)-interacting partner. The interaction between AGB1 and PP2C52 was confirmed by an in vitro pull-down assay and a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. PP2C52 transcripts were detected in many tissues. PP2C52 was localized to the plasma membrane and a mutation in the putative myristoylation site of PP2C52 disrupted its plasma membrane localization. Our results suggest that PP2C52 interacts with AGB1 on the plasma membrane and transmits signals via dephosphorylation of other proteins.

Abstract: Light-induced plating (LIP) can be used to form self-aligned metal contacts to selective-emitter silicon solar cells. Although LIP of metal contacts is attractively simple, it is difficult to directly measure parameters, such as the average plating current density, which are required if the plating chemistry is to be optimised. In this paper we describe the use of inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry techniques to characterise LIP of laser-doped selective-emitter silicon solar cells. The average plating current density and the effect of different anode and cathode configurations on the aluminium dissolution from the rear surfaces of the solar cells were evaluated. The quality of LIP nickel layers was also characterised using ICP measurements for various critical parameters in the cell design, such as the conductivity of the laser-doped grooves and the lateral resistance of the emitter.

Abstract: Bim is a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family that enables the death of T-cells. Partial rescue of cytokine-deprived T-cells occurs when Bim and the receptor for the T-cell growth factor, interleukin-7, are deleted, implicating Bim as a possible target of interleukin-7-mediated signaling. Alternative splicing yields three major isoforms: BimEL, BimL and BimS. To study the effect of Bim deficiency and define the function of the major isoforms, Bim-containing and Bim-deficient T-cells, dependent on interleukin-7 for growth, were used. Loss of total Bim in interleukin-7-deprived T-cells resulted in delayed apoptosis. However, loss of Bim also impeded the later degradative phase of autophagy. p62, an autophagy-adaptor protein which is normally degraded, accumulated in Bim deficient cells. To explain this, BimL was found to support acidification of lysosomes that later may associate with autophagic vesicles. Key findings showed that inhibition of lysosomal acidification accelerated death upon interleukin-7 withdrawal only in Bim-containing T-cells. intereukin-7 dependent T-cells lacking Bim were less sensitive to inhibition of lysosomal acidification. BimL co-immunoprecipitated with dynein and Lamp1-containing vesicles, indicating BimL could be an adaptor for dynein to facilitate loading of lysosomes. In Bim deficient T-cells, lysosome-tracking probes revealed vesicles of less acidic pH. Over-expression of BimL restored acidic vesicles in Bim deficient T-cells, while other isoforms, BimEL and BimS, promoted intrinsic cell death. These results reveal a novel role for BimL in lysosomal positioning that may be required for the formation of degradative autolysosomes.

Abstract: Inactivation of S. cerevisiae β-karyopherin Msn5 causes hypersensitivity to the overexpression of mitotic cyclin Clb2 and aggravates growth defects of many mutant strains in mitotic exit, suggesting a connection between Msn5 and mitotic exit. We determined that Msn5 controlled subcellular localization of the mitotic exit transcription factor Swi5, since it was required for Swi5 nuclear export. Msn5 physically interacted with the N-terminal end of Swi5. Inactivation of Msn5 caused a severe reduction in cellular levels of Swi5 protein. This effect occurred by a post-transcriptional mechanism, since SWI5 mRNA levels were not affected. The reduced amount of Swi5 in msn5 mutant cells was not due to an increased protein degradation rate, but to a defect in Swi5 synthesis. Despite the change in localization and protein level, Swi5-regulated transcription was not defective in the msn5 mutant strain. However, a high level of Swi5 was toxic in the absence of Msn5. This deleterious effect was eliminated when Swi5 nuclear import was abrogated, suggesting that nuclear export by Msn5 is important for cell physiology, because it prevents toxic Swi5 nuclear accumulation.

Abstract: A study of comparison of the electrical and optical characteristics of silicon solar cells (SC) with a layer of silicon oxide (SiO2) deposited by SILOX, and silicon solar cells covered with a silicon rich oxide (SRO) film obtained by LPCVD containing silicon nanoparticles (Si-nps) was made. To increase the density of nanoparticles and thus improve the red photoluminescence, the SRO films were annealed at 1100°C. Photoluminescence spectra and atomic force microscopy measurements of the silicon rich oxide films are presented and discussed, as well as current–voltage curves and spectral response of the fabricated solar cells. Measurement of the open circuit voltage and short circuit current of the SC under UV light illumination was realized. The results demonstrate that the red luminescence of these films with silicon nanoparticles, produces large enhancement of current and voltage, with improved performance in the UV range.

Abstract: We demonstrate high response organic ultraviolet photodetectors utilizing 1,3,5-tris(3-methylphenyl-phenylamino)-triphenylamine (m-MTDATA) and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BPhen), which act as electron donor (D) and acceptor (A), respectively. The optimized device exhibits a peak photocurrent of 2.46mA/cm2 at −12V under an illumination of 365nm ultraviolet light irradiation with an intensity of 2.82mW/cm2, corresponding to a response of 872mA/W. The high response is attributed to large energy offset, efficient electron transfer from m-MTDATA to BPhen and high charge carrier mobilities of D and A.

Abstract: The ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Rad6B is overexpressed in breast cancer and induces β-catenin transcriptional activation and stabilization via K63-linked polyubiquitination. Here we identify β-catenin and Rad6B interacting regions, identify potential Rad6B ubiquitination sites in β-catenin, and characterize their breast cancer tissue expression. β-catenin and Rad6B colocalize in breast carcinoma and coimmunoprecipitate from MDA-MB-231 cells. Pull-down assays using GST-β-catenin and His-Rad6B deletion mutants identified amino acids 131–181 and 50–116, respectively, as necessary for their interaction. Ubiquitination assays using β-catenin deletion mutants mapped Rad6B-induced ubiquitination within β-catenin 181–422 encompassing Armadillo repeats 2–7. Lysine to arginine mutations within repeats 5–7 identified K394 as the major Rad6B ubiquitination site in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed by Rad6B ubiquitination of a β-catenin peptide encompassing K394. Ubiquitination of wild type- but not K394R-β-catenin was decreased by Rad6B silencing. Compared to wild type-, K312R-, K335R-, K345R-, or K354R-β-catenin, K394R mutation caused ~50% drop in TOP/Flash activity in Wnt-silent MCF-7 cells. Consistent with these data, expression of Rad6B, itself a β-catenin/TCF transcriptional target, was also reduced in K394R-β-catenin transfected cells. Steady-state K394R-β-catenin levels are decreased compared to wild type-β-catenin. The decreased expression is not due to proteasomal degradation as treatment with MG132 failed to rescue its levels. Lymph node-positive breast carcinomas express higher levels of Rad6 protein and Rad6 activity, and K63-linked ubiquitinated β-catenin than reduction mammoplasties. These data suggest that K394 is a novel site of β-catenin ubiquitination that may be important for the stability and activity of β-catenin in breast cancer.

Abstract: We report a fast-switching negative photoelectrochromic cell composed of a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode and Prussian blue counter electrode sandwiching a LiI electrolyte. The cell can be bleached under illumination with shorted TiO2 and Prussian blue electrodes, and re-colored by applying an appropriate external voltage. The photo-bleaching and electric-coloring processes are fast and reversible. A maximum absorbance modulation of 0.44 recorded at 700nm is obtained between bleached and colored states for the cell when the PB film's thickness is 452nm. Illuminated under different levels of light intensity or durations of time, the shorted cell shows adjustable optical absorption from 470 to 840nm. The in-situ transmittance response depicts that the photo-bleaching response is 6.2s for 70% transmittance change under 100mW/cm2 illumination in short circuit configuration, and the re-coloration time is about 600ms under 2V bias recorded at 780nm, with an electrochromic coloration efficiency of 103.4cm2/C. The cell shows a good reversible stability and can be potentially applied in erasable displays.

Abstract: Protein kinase C (PKC) signaling regulates osteoblast differentiation, but little is known about its downstream effectors. We examined the effect of modulating PKC activity on osteogenic transcription factors and found that the protein level of Msx2 is affected. Msx2 is induced by osteogenic signals such as BMPs and it plays critical roles in bone formation and osteoblast differentiation. Here, we examined the role of PKC signaling in regulating the function of Msx2. We found that the inhibition of PKC signaling enhances osteogenic differentiation in BMP2-stimulated C2C12 cells. Treatment with inhibitors of PKC activity or overexpression of kinase-defective (KD), dominant-negative mutant PKC isoforms strongly reduced the level of Msx2 protein. Several PKC isoforms (α, β, δ, and ζ) interacted with Msx2, and PKCβ phosphorylated Msx2 at Thr135 and Thr141. Msx2 repressed the transcriptional activity of the osteogenic transcription factor Runx2, and this repression was relieved by inhibition of PKC activity or overexpression of the KD mutant PKC isoforms. In addition, PKC prolonged the half-life of Msx2 protein. These results suggest that PKC signaling modulates osteoblast differentiation, at least in part, through the regulation of Msx2.

Abstract: Quinoxaline-based π-conjugated donor polymers with different substituent groups (phenyl, p-fluorophenyl, p-methoxyphenyl, methyl, or hydrogen) on the quinoxaline unit were synthesized and characterized, focusing on the effects of these substituent groups on the performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-based polymer solar cells fabricated with phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) as an acceptor. Polymers with phenyl groups or p-methoxyphenyl groups showed nanometer-scale phase separation or uniform morphology in BHJ film, together with high field effect transistor (FET) hole mobility. On the other hand, polymers with methyl or hydrogen and a polymer with fluorine exhibited micrometer-scale domains in BHJ and low hole mobility. It is suggested that the mostly steric hindrance of the substituents regulate the polymer's aggregation properties and compatibility with [70]PCBM, which probably affects the hole transport properties and BHJ morphologies. We also investigated the effects of substituent groups on highest occupied molecular orbital energy level and optical band gap of the polymers.

Abstract: A study of the effect of hydrogen annealing on antireflection and surface passivation properties of sol–gel derived aluminum rich zinc oxide (AZO) films coated on silicon wafers has been done in 300–600°C temperature range. The minority carrier lifetime in silicon wafers coated with AZO films was measured using microwave photoconductive decay (μ-PCD) technique. After annealing of AZO coated silicon wafer in hydrogen ambient for 30min between 400 and 600°C the effective minority carrier lifetime τeff improved above the initial value of ∼16μs and attained a maximal value of ∼71μs for annealing at 500°C. It may be that above 400°C the molecular hydrogen gets dissociated into atomic hydrogen in presence of Al induced defects at the AZO coated silicon surface and passivates them by formation of Si–H–Al complex. The annealing in air in the same temperature range did not affect the lifetime. AZO films annealed at 500°C in hydrogen or air show high transmittance in 400–1200nm wavelength range and are suitable as AR coatings for silicon solar cells. We have applied a hydrogen annealed AZO antireflection coating on n+ front surface and an equally thick hydrogen annealed AZO coating on the p-back surface of an n+-p multi crystalline silicon solar cell. The observed improvement in Jsc, Voc values of the cell established that while AZO film on front acted as a good AR coating the AZO film on the back surface passivated the back surface effectively.

Abstract: Currently, there is significant interest in the field of diet–gene interactions and the mechanisms by which food compounds regulate gene expression to modify cancer susceptibility. From a nutrition perspective, two key components potentially exert cancer chemopreventive effects: isothiocyanates (ITCs), present in cruciferous vegetables, and selenium (Se) which, as selenocysteine, is an integral part of selenoproteins. However, the role of these compounds in the expression of key selenoenzymes once the cancer process has been initiated still needs elucidation. Therefore, this investigation examined the effect of two forms of selenium, selenium-methylselenocysteine and sodium selenite, both individually and in combination with two ITCs, sulforaphane or iberin, on the expression of the two selenoenzymes, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) and gastrointestinal glutathione peroxidase (GPx2), which are targets of ITCs, in Caco-2 cells. Co-treatment with both ITCs and Se induced expression of TrxR1 and GPx2 more than either compound alone. Moreover, pre-treatment of cells with ITC+Se enhanced cytoprotection against H2O2-induced cell death through a ROS-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, a single and double knockdown of TrxR1 and/or GPx2 suggested that both selenoproteins were responsible for protecting against H2O2-induced cell death. Together, these data shed new light on the mechanism of interactions between ITC and Se in which translational expression of the enhanced transcripts by the former is dependent on an adequate Se supply, resulting in a cooperative antioxidant protective effect against cell death.

Abstract: Telomerase is mainly active in human tumor cells, which provides an opportunity for a therapeutic window on telomerase targeting. We sought to evaluate the potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer. Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells. After only 1week of imetelstat treatment, a reduction of colony formation ability of esophageal cancer cells was observed. Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths. Short-term imetelstat treatment also increased γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci staining in the esophageal cancer cell lines indicating a possible induction of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). We also found that pre-treatment with imetelstat led to increased number and size of 53BP1 foci after ionizing radiation. The increase of 53BP1 foci number was especially pronounced during the first 1h of repair whereas the increase of foci size was prominent later on. This study supports the potential of imetelstat as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of esophageal cancer.

Abstract: Brown adipocytes play an important role in regulating energy balance, and there is a good correlation between obesity and the amount of brown adipose tissue. Although the molecular mechanism of white adipocyte differentiation has been well characterized, brown adipogenesis has not been studied extensively. Moreover, extracellular factors that regulate brown adipogenic differentiation are not fully understood. Here, we assessed the mechanism of the regulatory action of myostatin in brown adipogenic differentiation using primary brown preadipocytes. Our results clearly showed that differentiation of brown adipocytes was significantly inhibited by myostatin treatment. In addition, myostatin-induced suppression of brown adipogenesis was observed during the early phase of differentiation. Myostatin induced the phosphorylation of Smad3, which led to increased β-catenin stabilization. These effects were blocked by treatment with a Smad3 inhibitor. Expression of brown adipocyte-related genes, such as PPAR-γ, UCP-1, PGC-1α, and PRDM16, were dramatically down-regulated by treatment with myostatin, and further down-regulated by co-treatment with a β-catenin activator. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that myostatin is a potent negative regulator of brown adipogenic differentiation by modulation of Smad3-induced β-catenin stabilization. Our findings suggest that myostatin could be used as an extracellular factor in the control of brown adipocyte differentiation.

Abstract: We demonstrate semitransparent inverted polymer solar cells with highly transparent anodes. The structure of the anode is molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)/silver (Ag)/vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). The inner MoO3 layer is introduced as a buffer layer to improve holes collection, while the outer V2O5 layer served as a light coupling layer to enhance optical transmittance of the photovoltaic device. The maximum transmittance of 90% from 400nm to 700nm is obtained when the thickness of V2O5 is 40nm. When the thickness of V2O5 is 40nm, under AM1.5G illumination of 100mW/cm2 illuminated from ITO side (bottom), the Jsc is 5.01mA/cm2, the Voc is 0.591V, the FF is 61.8%, and the PCE is 1.83%; from MoO3/Ag/V2O5 side (top), the Jsc is 4.28mA/cm2, the Voc is 0.585V, the FF is 61.9%, and the PCE is 1.55%. The trend of the optical electric field distribution is highly consistent with the Jsc, which is dependent on the thickness of the V2O5 top capping layer.

Abstract: How a committed cell can be reverted to an undifferentiated state is a central question in stem cell biology. This process, called dedifferentiation, is likely to be important for replacing stem cells as they age or get damaged. Tremendous progress has been made in understanding this fundamental process, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the aberrant activation of Ras-ERK MAPK signaling promotes cellular dedifferentiation in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline. To activate signaling, we removed two negative regulators, the PUF-8 RNA-binding protein and LIP-1 dual specificity phosphatase. The removal of both of these two regulators caused secondary spermatocytes to dedifferentiate and begin mitotic divisions. Interestingly, reduction of Ras-ERK MAPK signaling, either by mutation or chemical inhibition, blocked the initiation of dedifferentiation. By RNAi screening, we identified RSKN-1/P90RSK as a downstream effector of MPK-1/ERK that is critical for dedifferentiation: rskn-1 RNAi suppressed spermatocyte dedifferentiation and instead induced meiotic divisions. These regulators are broadly conserved, suggesting that similar molecular circuitry may control cellular dedifferentiation in other organisms, including humans.

Abstract: Abro1 (Abraxas brother 1), also known as KIAA0157, is a scaffold protein that recruits various polypeptides to assemble the BRISC (BRCC36 isopeptide) deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) complex. The BRISC enzyme has a Lys63-linked deubiquitinating activity and is comprised of four known subunits: MERIT40 (mediator of Rap80 interactions and targeting 40kDa), BRE (brain and reproductive organ-expressed), BRCC36 (BRCA1/BRCA2-containing complex, subunit 3) and Abro1. We have previously shown that Abro1 has a cytoprotective role that involves the BRISC DUB complex acting on specific Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated substrates. In this report we identify three members of the AP-1 (activating protein-1) family, the ATF4, ATF5 (activating transcription factor) and JunD proteins, as specific interactors of Abro1. The function of ATF4–Abro1 interaction was investigated under normal conditions as well as under cellular stress. Abro1 is predominantly cytoplasmic, but during cellular stress it enters the nucleus and co-localizes with ATF4. Furthermore, this interaction with ATF4 is necessary and essential for the cytoprotective function of Abro1 following oxidative stress. The ability of Abro1 to specifically interact with a number of transcription factors suggests a new mechanism of regulation of the BRISC DUB complex. This regulation involves the participation of at least three known members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors.

Abstract: Neuroglobin is a member of the globin superfamily expressed in vertebrate brain and retina. The protein is thought to be involved in neuronal protection from hypoxia or oxidative stress and could represent a key element of Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Our aim was to determine whether neuroglobin could be directly associated with mitochondrial metabolism and integrity. We identified three different forms of neuroglobin in the retina, varying in their apparent molecular masses; all forms are abundant in mitochondrial fractions. This indicates that a significant fraction of the protein localizes within the organelle either in the matrix or in the matrix side of the inner membrane. Since neuroglobin was especially abundant in the ganglion cell layer, we transduced retinal ganglion cells with an anti-neuroglobin short hairpin RNA using in vivo electroporation. Neuroglobin knockdown leads to reduced activities of respiratory chain complexes I and III, degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, and impairment of visual function. The deleterious effect on cell survival was confirmed in primary retinal ganglion cells subjected to inhibition of neuroglobin expression. Hence, neuroglobin should be considered as a novel mitochondrial protein involved in respiratory chain function which is essential for retinal ganglion cell integrity.

Abstract: The transcriptional activator β-catenin is a key mediator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. β-catenin itself does not bind DNA but functions via interaction with T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid-enhancing factor (LEF) transcription factors. Thus, in the case of active Wnt signaling, β-catenin, in cooperation with TCF/LEF proteins family, activates the expression of a wide variety of genes. To date, the list of established β-catenin interacting targets is far from complete. In this study, we aimed to establish the interaction between β-catenin and transcription factors that might affect TCF activity. We took advantage of EMSA, using TCF as a probe, to screen oligonucleotides known to bind specific transcription factors that might dislodge or antagonize β-catenin/TCF binding. We found that Sox9 and KLF4 antagonize β-catenin/TCF binding in HEK293, A549, SW480, and T47D cells. This inhibition of TCF binding was concentration-dependent and correlated to the in vitro TCF-luciferase functional assays. Overexpression of Sox9 and KLF4 transcription factors in cancer cells shows a concentration-dependent reduction of TCF-luciferase as well as the TCF-binding activities. In addition, we demonstrated that both Sox9 and KLF4 interact with β-catenin in an immunoprecipitation assay and reduce its binding to TCF4. Together, these results demonstrate that Sox9 and KLF4 transcription factors antagonize β-catenin/TCF in cancer cells.

Abstract: XAB1/Gpn1 is a GTPase that associates with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) in a GTP-dependent manner. Although XAB1/Gpn1 is essential for nuclear accumulation of RNAPII, the underlying mechanism is not known. A XAB1/Gpn1-EYFP fluorescent protein, like endogenous XAB1/Gpn1, localized to the cytoplasm but it rapidly accumulated in the cell nucleus in the presence of leptomycin B, a chemical inhibitor of the nuclear transport receptor Crm1. Crm1 recognizes short peptides in substrate proteins called nuclear export sequences (NES). Here, we employed site-directed mutagenesis and fluorescence microscopy to assess the functionality of all six putative NESs in XAB1/Gpn1. Mutating five of the six putative NESs did not alter the cytoplasmic localization of XAB1/Gpn1-EYFP. However, a V302A/L304A double mutant XAB1/Gpn1-EYFP protein was clearly accumulated in the cell nucleus, indicating the disruption of a functional NES. This functional XAB1/Gpn1 NES displays all features present in most common and potent NESs, including, in addition to Φ1–Φ4, a critical fifth hydrophobic amino acid Φ0. Therefore, in human Gpn1 this NES spans amino acids 292-LERLRKDMGSVAL-304. XAB1/Gpn1 NES is remarkably conserved during evolution. XAB1/Gpn1 NES was sufficient for nuclear export activity, as it caused a complete exclusion of EYFP from the cell nucleus. Molecular modeling of XAB1/Gpn1 provided a mechanistic reason for NES selection, as functionality correlated with accessibility, and it also suggested a mechanism for NES inhibition by intramolecular masking. In conclusion, we have identified a highly active, evolutionarily conserved NES in XAB1/Gpn1 that is critical for nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and steady-state cytoplasmic localization of XAB1/Gpn1.

Abstract: A photoelectrochromic device (PECD), with no need for an external power source, is studied under open and short-circuit conditions with light illumination. In this report, the conductive polymer, poly(3,3-diethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno-[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine) (PProDOT-Et2), plays two roles, namely, as the electrochromic thin layer for electrochrome and the counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). An organic photosensitive dye, FL dye1, is adsorbed on a TiO2 electrode for providing the photocurrent. The electrolyte containing LiClO4, Br−/Br3− redox couple, succinonitrile, and poly-(vinylidenefluoride-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) dissolved in propylene carbonate (PC) is proposed as the gel electrolyte for the PECD. When the volume ratio of PVDF-HFP to succinonitrile is 6:2, the DSSC part provides a photocurrent density of 0.164mAcm−2, a photovoltage of 0.75V, a fill factor of 0.48, with a solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of 0.059% to drive the electrochromic reaction. This solar-to-electric power is sufficient for observing the electrochromism of PProDOT-Et2, due to its high coloration efficiency. Moreover, when succinonitrile is added to the PVDF-HFP/PC electrolyte, the nucleus size of PVDF-HFP in the composite was reduced. This is because the effective space available for the primary nucleation in the composite was reduced, thus suppressing the crystallization and increasing the ionic conductivity and the diffusivity of the electrolyte. This results in a shorter bleaching time (20–35s) of the PECD compared with the devices using succinonitrile (177s) or PVDF-HFP (126s) alone. In this case, the transmittance can be changed reversibly from 46% (bleached) to 15% (darkened) at 590nm.

Abstract: We investigated the effect of counter electrode reaction on the coloration properties of phthalate-based electrochromic (EC) cells using various counter materials. Although the coloration characteristics of dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) cells were improved using a counter material of ferrocene, an organic-based counter material could not endure the overload because of the high reduction potential of DMT. On the other hand, a DMT cell using an inorganic counter material showed good long-term switching stability. As a result, we achieved good switching stability over 5000 cycles for the phthalate-based EC cell with NiO as the counter material.

Abstract: A method of measurement of diffusion length L in p type c-Si wafers based on the lateral collection of minority carriers is reported. In this method, wafer requires a p–p+ junction on entire back surface and an n+–p interface on a part of the front surface leaving the rest part as bare for illumination. A photo-current Isc is generated when a rectangular area of a part of the bare front surface in the vicinity of the n+–p interface is illuminated with a laser beam. The magnitude of Isc varies with the normal distance d between the electron collecting n+–p interface and the nearest edge of the illuminated region. The slope Φ of the normalized Isc vs. d curve is used to determine a parameter sinh−1θ, which has a linear relation with d. The reciprocal of the slope of sinh−1θ vs. d curve in the linear region gives the diffusion length L. The value of L is less susceptible to error due to the effect of Sf of bare silicon surface if the linear region of sinh−1θ vs. d curve lies in the region of smaller d values. The present method has an advantage over the other methods in that it does not depend on the intensity of the illumination and absorption coefficient of Si. Additionally, method has no limitation in terms of wafer thickness to diffusion length ratio and is applicable to all practical L values.

Abstract: The vertical distribution of blended components in the active layer of a bulk heterojunction solar cell composed of poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl] (PDTS-BTD) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was studied using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) depth profile. We found that the vertical profile of the PDTS-BTD:PC71BM thin films varies, with a PC71BM rich region near the bottom surface and a polymer rich on the top surface. This suggests that the inverted device geometry may be superior to the conventional device geometry for the fabrication of efficient polymer solar cells. Significant enhancement in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of an inverted polymer solar cell was observed compared to the conventional cell. The enhancement in device performance is attributed to the efficient charge extraction due to the exploitation of vertical morphology of the active layer using the inverted device geometry.

Abstract: Purinergic signaling cascade includes the release of endogenous ATP and other agonists by chemical and mechanical stimuli, modulation of diverse cellular functions and subsequent ectoenzymatic inactivation. Basal release of extracellular purines and its physiological relevance remain controversial. Here we employed a combination of enzyme-coupled approaches for simultaneous bioluminescent (ATP, ADP, PPi) and fluorometric (AMP, adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine) measurements of ATP and its metabolites without additional manipulations or derivatization of sampled biological fluids. By using these sensing techniques, extracellular purines were determined in various cells and tissues both at resting and pro-inflammatory conditions. The results obtained revealed the ability of endothelial, lymphoid and tumor cells to maintain extracellular ATP, ADP and adenosine at certain characteristic nanomolar levels. By quantifying the amounts of endogenously released and/or exogenously applied purines and their metabolites, these sensing techniques may be applied for evaluating purine-converting pathways on the cell surfaces and also for ex vivo analysis of purine homeostasis in the intact tissues. Furthermore, we provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying tumorigenic effects of ATP by demonstrating the ability of metastatic prostate carcinoma PC3 and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells to maintain PPi, which derives from extracellular ATP in the course of nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase reaction. Collectively, the results imply a complex pattern of nucleotide turnover where extracellular ATP, ADP and adenosine are maintained at steady-state levels via counterbalanced release and inactivation of ATP and other purines, and further suggest the importance of basal agonist release for continuous activation and/or desensitization of purinergic receptors.

Abstract: Background
Several important functions for a successful spermatogenesis are dependent on Sertoli cells (SCs). Besides their unique characteristics as support cells, they produce essential cofactors and metabolites, and are responsible for nurturing the developing germ cells. The continuous production of lipids, phospholipids and proteins by germ cells must require high amounts of metabolic precursors. Thus, we hypothesized that hSCs could produce acetate in a hormonally-regulated manner.
Methods
hSC-enriched primary cultures were maintained in the absence of insulin or in the presence of 17β-estradiol (E2) or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Acetate production was determined by 1H-NMR. mRNA gene expression levels of Acetyl CoA hydrolase (ACoA Hyd) and Acetyl CoA synthase (ACoA Synt) were determined by RT-PCR.
Results
hSCs produced high amounts of acetate suggesting that this metabolite should play a key role on the progression of spermatogenesis, namely as a metabolic precursor for the synthesis of cellular constituents. In addition, acetate metabolism proved to be under strict hormonal regulation. In the presence of E2 or DHT, hSCs produced different amounts of acetate. While E2 treatment increased acetate production, increasing ACoA Hyd gene transcript levels, DHT-treated cells showed decreased acetate production, differently modulating the ratio ACoA Hyd/ACoA Synt. Surprisingly, insulin-deprivation completely suppressed acetate production/export and significantly decreased the ACoA Hyd gene transcript levels.
General significance
Taken together, these results suggest that, although hSCs are primarily described as lactate producers, the elevated production of acetate deserves special attention, in order to clarify the mechanisms behind its hormonal regulation and its role on a successful spermatogenesis.

Abstract: The optical switching properties of switchable mirrors based on alloys of magnesium and alkaline-earth metals, such as Ca, Sr, and Ba, were studied systematically using a gasochromic method. All prepared switchable mirrors showed excellent switchable mirror properties, and high visible transmittance and color neutral appearance in their transparent states. The achromatic properties with high visible transmittance may be because the hydrides of these alloys show grayish neutral color appearance.

Abstract: We report the surface passivation studies made on p-type single-crystalline silicon wafers using ethanolic solution of iodine and bromine. Minority carrier lifetime (τeff) is measured by the microwave photoconductance decay (μ-PCD) method and using a Sinton's lifetime tester. Measurements are carried out at different molar concentrations of iodine–ethanol (I–E) and bromine–ethanol (B–E) solutions to optimize the process parameters. It is found that good passivation (±5% of measured maximum lifetime) could be achieved for certain ranges of concentration, which in the case of I–E and B–E are 0.07–0.12M and 0.05–0.07M, respectively. The effect of pre-conditioning steps on surface passivation (silicon surfaces with and without native oxide) is investigated. It is shown that the quality of surface passivation can be improved by an optimized wet-chemical pre-conditioning treatment. The effect of bias light and passivation time is also studied. I–E solution provides better passivation than B–E solution in terms of τeff whereas B–E solution passivation exhibits better stability in comparison with I–E solution. The τeff measured by the Sinton method (WCT-120) and using a Semilab system (μ-PCD, WT-2000) are comparable if injection levels are matched.

Abstract: Two-pore channels (TPCs) are NAADP-sensitive receptor channels that conduct Ca2+ efflux from the intracellular stores. Discharge of the internal Ca2+ pools results in the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE); however, the role of TPCs in the modulation of SOCE remains unexplored. Mammalian cells express three TPCs: TPC1, TPC2 and TPC3, a pseudogene in humans. Here we report that MEG01 and HEK293 cells endogenously express TPC1 and TPC2. Silencing TPC2 expression results in attenuation of the rate and extent of thapsigargin (TG)-evoked SOCE both in MEG01 and HEK293 cells, without having any effect on the ability of cells to accumulate Ca2+ into the TG-sensitive stores. Similarly, silencing of native TPC2 expression reduced thrombin-induced Ca2+ entry in MEG01 cells. In contrast, silencing of TPC1 expression was without effect either on TG or thrombin-stimulated Ca2+ entry both in MEG01 and HEK293 cells. Biotinylation analysis revealed that TPC1 and TPC2 are expressed in internal membranes. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that endogenously expressed TPC2, but not TPC1, associates with STIM1 and Orai1, but not with TRPC1, in MEG01 cells with depleted intracellular Ca2+ stores, but not in resting cells. These results provide strong evidence for the modulation of SOCE by TPC2 involving de novo association between TPC2 and STIM1, as well as Orai1, in human cells.

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that the macrophage scavenger receptor class A (SR-A, aka, CD204) plays a role in the induction of innate immune and inflammatory responses. We investigated whether SR-A will cooperate with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in response to TLR ligand stimulation. Macrophages (J774/a) were treated with Pam2CSK4, (TLR2 ligand), Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) (TLR3 ligand), and Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (TLR4 ligand) for 15min in the presence or absence of fucoidan (the SR-A ligand). The levels of phosphorylated IκBα (p-IκBα) were examined by Western blot. We observed that Poly I:C and LPS alone, but not Pam2CSK4 or fucoidan increased the levels of p-IκBα. However, LPS-induced increases in p-IκBα levels were further enhanced when presence of the fucoidan. Immunoprecipitation and double fluorescent staining showed that LPS stimulation promotes SR-A association with TLR4 in the presence of fucoidan. To further confirm our observation, we isolated peritoneal macrophages from SR-A deficient (SR-A−/−), TLR4−/− and wild type (WT) mice, respectively. The peritoneal macrophages were treated with LPS for 15min in the presence and absence of fucoidan. We observed that LPS-stimulated TNFα and IL-1β production was further enhanced in the WT macrophages, but did not in either TLR4−/− or SR-A−/− macrophages, when fucoidan was present. Similarly, in the presence of fucoidan, LPS-induced IκBα phosphorylation, NF-κB binding activity, and association between TLR4 and SR-A were significantly enhanced in WT macrophages compared with LPS stimulation alone. The data suggests that SR-A is needed for LPS-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages.

Abstract: Nur77, Nurr1 and NOR-1 form the NR4A subfamily of the nuclear receptor superfamily and have been shown to regulate various biological processes among which are cell survival and differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation and metabolism. These nuclear receptors have been proposed to act in a ligand-independent manner and we aim to gain insight in the regulation of NR4A activity. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 as a novel binding partner of NR4As, which was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Pin1 enhances the transcriptional activity of all three NR4A nuclear receptors and increases protein stability of Nur77 through inhibition of its ubiquitination. Enhanced transcriptional activity of NR4As requires the WW-domain of Pin1 that interacts with the N-terminal transactivation domain and the DNA-binding domain of Nur77. Most remarkably, this enhanced activity is independent of Pin1 isomerase activity. A systematic mutation analysis of all 17 Ser/Thr-Pro-motifs in Nur77 revealed that Pin1 enhances protein stability of Nur77 in an isomerase-dependent manner by acting on phosphorylated Nur77 involving protein kinase CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the Ser152-Pro153 motif in Nur77. Given the role of Nur77 in vascular disease and metabolism, this novel regulation mechanism provides perspectives to manipulate Nur77 activity to attenuate these processes.

Abstract: Trans fats are not a homogeneous group of molecules and less is known about the cellular effects of individual members of the group. Vaccenic acid (VA) and elaidic acid (EA) are the predominant trans monoenes in ruminant fats and vegetable oil, respectively. Here, we investigated the mechanism of cell death induced by VA and EA on primary rat ventricular myofibroblasts (rVF). The MTT assay demonstrated that both VA and EA (200μM, 0–72h) reduced cell viability in rVF (P<0.001). The FACS assay confirmed that both VA and EA induced apoptosis in rVF, and this was concomitant with elevation in cleaved caspase-9, -3 and -7, but not caspase-8. VA and EA decreased the expression ratio of Bcl2:Bax, induced Bax translocation to mitochondria and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ). BAX and BAX/BAK silencing in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) inhibited VA and EA-induced cell death compared to the corresponding wild type cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that VA and EA also induced macroautophagosome formation in rVF, and immunoblot analysis confirmed the induction of several autophagy markers: LC3-β lipidation, Atg5–12 accumulation, and increased beclin-1. Finally, deletion of autophagy genes, ATG3 and ATG5 significantly inhibited VA and EA-induced cell death (P<0.001). Our findings show for the first time that trans fat acid (TFA) induces simultaneous apoptosis and autophagy in rVF. Furthermore, TFA-induced autophagy is required for this pro-apoptotic effect. Further studies to address the effect of TFA on the heart may reveal significant translational value for prevention of TFA-linked heart disease.

Abstract: Hydrated ZrO2 thin films were prepared by reactive sputtering in H2O atmosphere at different substrate temperatures. The crystal structure, chemical bonding state, film density, refractive index, surface morphology and ion conductivity of the films were investigated. The intensity of the absorbance peaks due to hydrogen bonded OH groups increased and the film density decreased with decreasing substrate temperature. Correspondingly, the ion conductivity increased with decreasing substrate temperature and a maximum ion conductivity of 6×10−6S/m was obtained for the film deposited at the lowest substrate temperature of −30°C. We considered that the addition of H2O in the reactive gas and substrate cooling were very effective in increasing the H2O content and decreasing film density, which resulted in the high proton conductivity of the films.

Abstract: In this work, small molecule organic photovoltaic cells based on copper phthalocyanine (CuPc)/C60 hetrojunction were fabricated. To have a good band structure matching between the work function of the anode and the highest occupied molecular orbital of the organic material the introduction of a buffer layer is necessary. Efficiency of devices shows a strong improvement when the metal oxides such as molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and tungsten oxide (WO3) were used as buffer layer between the ITO anode and active layer. The effect of MoO3 and WO3 thickness on the performance of the photovoltaic devices was investigated and compared. The thickness of each buffer layer was optimized to have better hole transport. Also the devices' performance was analyzed based on the surface roughness of bare ITO, and ITO, which covered with WO3 and MoO3. It was found that the anode buffer layer thickness is a very important factor in controlling the electrical characteristics of the organic photovoltaic devices. It is shown that the best results are obtained with a 4nm MoO3.

Abstract: Retinoid-inducible gene 1 (RIG1), also called tazarotene-induced gene 3, belongs to the HREV107 gene family, which contains five members in humans. RIG1 is expressed in high levels in well-differentiated tissues, but its expression is decreased in cancer tissues and cancer cell lines. We found RIG1 to be highly expressed in testicular cells. When RIG1 was expressed in NT2/D1 testicular cancer cells, neither cell death nor cell viability was affected. However, RIG1 significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in NT2/D1 cells. We found that prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) interacted with RIG1 using yeast two-hybrid screens. Further, we found PTGDS to be co-localized with RIG1 in NT2/D1 testis cells. In RIG1-expressing cells, elevated levels of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), cAMP, and SRY-related high-mobility group box 9 (SOX9) were observed. This indicated that RIG1 can enhance PTGDS activity. Silencing of PTGDS expression significantly decreased RIG1-mediated cAMP and PGD2 production. Furthermore, silencing of PTGDS or SOX9 alleviated RIG1-mediated suppression of migration and invasion. These results suggest that RIG1 will suppress cell migration/invasion through the PGD2 signaling pathway. In conclusion, RIG1 can interact with PTGDS to enhance its function and to further suppress NT2/D1 cell migration and invasion. Our study suggests that RIG1-PGD2 signaling might play an important role in cancer cell suppression in the testis.

Abstract: Pristine polysilane containing only Si and H is considered as a potential precursor material that allows the solution-based deposition of hydrogenated amorphous Si (a-Si:H) thin-films reducing manufacturing cost of Si thin-film photovoltaic devices. This study explored three different synthetic routes including Würtz-type reductive coupling reaction, hydrogenation of Si anionic compound, and the dehydrocoupling reaction in order to realize the soluble polysilane molecules. While Würtz-type reaction of diiodosilane presented us a direct synthetic scheme for hydrogenated polysilane, the results indicated that an extremely controlled air-free system for the synthesis and sample handling would be necessary to prevent the formation of siloxane bonds from the spontaneous reaction between silane-based molecules and water in the air. While the hydrogenation of CaSi2 and the dehydrocoupling reaction of phenylsilane provided more stable forms of polysilane, dissolution of the polysilane from CaSi2 in dichlorobenzene was not successful possibly due to its layered structure succeeded from CaSi2 and the removal of the phenyl groups from the synthesized polyphenylsilane remains as a challenge to realize the polysilane precursor necessary for the solution-based thin-film process of a-Si:H.

Abstract: In this study, we employed carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-modified polyaniline (PANI-CNTs) electrochromic (EC) thin film as the anodically coloring electrode and CNTs-modified poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT-CNTs) EC thin film as the cathodically coloring electrode. The electrochemically deposited PANI-CNTs film shows a transmittance change (ΔT) of 41.4% and a coloration efficiency (η) of 302cm2C−1 at 700nm. The PANI-CNTs film was assembled in a complementary electrochromic device (ECD) with the PEDOT-CNTs film, which exhibits a ΔT of 58.5% and a coloration efficiency of 562cm2C−1 at 630nm. The CNTs-modified ECD achieved a high η value of 836cm2C−1 at 650nm and maintained a ΔT value of 35%, as compared to an η value of 285cm2C−1 and a similar ΔT value (35%) at 570nm for a complementary PANI-PEDOT ECD without employing CNTs on both electrodes. No decay was noticed in both coloration efficiency and transmittance change after switching for 500 cycles.

Abstract: The type II diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) contain several functional domains such as a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, two C1 domains and a sterile α-motif (SAM) domain. It was previously revealed that DGKδ contributes to hyperglycemia-induced peripheral insulin resistance and thereby exacerbate the severity of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, a high extracellular concentration of glucose activated DGKδ in skeletal muscle cells, which was followed by a reduction in the intracellular diacylglycerol levels and the inactivation of protein kinase Cα, the enzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates the insulin receptor. However, the intracellular behavior of DGKδ upon high glucose stimulation remains unclear. In this study, we found that DGKδ1, but not a splice variant DGKδ2 or the other type II DGKη1/2, translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in human embryonic kidney HEK293 and mouse myoblast C2C12 cells within 5min in response to high glucose levels. The translocation was inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 and GDC-0941, suggesting that the event is regulated via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Moreover, we revealed that the PH and C1 domains are responsible for the plasma membrane translocation and that the SAM domain negatively regulates the translocation. These results indicate that DGKδ1 is the sole type II DGK isoform that responds rapidly and dynamically to high glucose levels.

Abstract: Glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells depends on mitochondrial activation. In the organelle, glucose-derived pyruvate is metabolised along the oxidative and anaplerotic pathway to generate downstream signals leading to insulin granule exocytosis. Entry into the oxidative pathway is catalysed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and controlled in part by phosphorylation of the PDH E1α subunit blocking enzyme activity. We find that glucose but not other nutrient secretagogues induce PDH E1α phosphorylation in INS-1E cells and rat islets. INS-1E cells and primary β-cells express pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 1, 2 and 3, which mediate the observed phosphorylation. In INS-1E cells, suppression of the two main isoforms, PDK1 and PDK3, almost completely prevented PDH E1α phosphorylation. Under basal glucose conditions, phosphorylation was barely detectable and therefore the enzyme almost fully active (90% of maximal). During glucose stimulation, PDH is only partially inhibited (to 78% of maximal). Preventing PDH phosphorylation in situ after suppression of PDK1, 2 and 3 neither enhanced pyruvate oxidation nor insulin secretion. In conclusion, although glucose stimulates E1α phosphorylation and therefore inhibits PDH activity, this control mechanism by itself does not alter metabolism-secretion coupling in INS-1E clonal β-cells.

Abstract: Mutations in the mitochondrial DNA can lead to the development of mitochondrial diseases such as Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers (MERRF) or Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes (MELAS). We first show that human 143B-derived cybrid cells harboring either the A8344G (MERRF) or the A3243G (MELAS) mutation, are more prone to undergo apoptosis then their wild-type counterpart, when challenged with various apoptotic inducers such as staurosporine, etoposide and TRAIL. In addition, investigating the mechanisms underlying A8344G cybrid cells hypersensitivity to staurosporine-induced cell death, we found that staurosporine treatment activates caspases independently of cytochrome c release in both wild-type and mutated cells. Caspases are activated, at least partly, through the activation of calcium-dependent calpain proteases, a pathway that is more strongly activated in mutated cybrid cells than in wild-type cells exposed to staurosporine. These results suggest that calcium homeostasis perturbation induced by mitochondrial dysfunction could predispose cells to apoptosis, a process that could take part into the progressive cell degeneration observed in MERRF syndrome, and more generally in mitochondrial diseases.

Abstract: Posttranslational modification of proteins by lysine acetylation regulates many biological processes ranging from signal transduction to chromatin compaction. Here we identify the acetyl-transferases CBP/p300, Tip60 and PCAF as new substrates for the ubiquitin E3 ligases SIAH1 and SIAH2. While CBP/p300 can undergo ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation by SIAH1 and SIAH2, the two other acetyl-transferases are exclusively degraded by SIAH2. Accordingly, SIAH-deficient cells show enhanced protein acetylation, thus revealing SIAH proteins as indirect regulators of the cellular acetylation status. Functional experiments show that Tip60/PCAF-mediated acetylation of the tumor suppressor p53 is antagonized by the p53 target gene SIAH2 which mediates ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of both acetyl-transferases and consequently diminishes p53 acetylation and transcriptional activity. The p53 kinase HIPK2 mediates hierarchical phosphorylation of SIAH2 at 5 sites, which further boosts its activity as a ubiquitin E3 ligase for several substrates and therefore dampens the late p53 response.

Abstract: This work presents a quantitative analysis on the relationship between the composition of PECVD silicon oxynitride and surface passivation on float zone silicon wafers with planar non-diffused surfaces using FTIR spectroscopy. Implied open circuit voltages of approximately 740mV are demonstrated on both n-type and p-type substrates, with associated 1-sun effective minority carrier lifetimes of 1.8ms and 1.1ms respectively. Improvements in the implied open circuit voltage of up to 80mV upon thermal annealing are presented for films with Si–H peak wavenumbers >2200cm−1 and are attributed to increasing oxygen incorporation.

Abstract: The ubiquitin proteasome pathway controls the cellular degradation of ~80–90% of the proteome in a highly regulated manner. In this pathway, E3 ligases are responsible for the conjugation of ubiquitin to protein substrates which can lead to their destruction by the 26S proteasome. Aberrant E3 ligases have been implicated in several diseases and are widely recognized as attractive targets for drug discovery. As researchers continue to characterize E3 ligases, additional associations with various disease states are being exposed. The availability of assays that allow rapid analysis of E3 ligase activity is paramount to both biochemical studies and drug discovery efforts aimed at E3 ligases. To address this need, we have developed a homogenous assay for monitoring ubiquitin chain formation using Tandem Ubiquitin Binding Entities (TUBEs). TUBEs bind selectively to polyubiquitin chains versus mono-ubiquitin thus enabling the detection of polyubiquitin chains in the presence of mono-ubiquitin. This assay reports on the proximity between the protein substrate and TUBEs as a result of polyubiquitin chain formation by an E3 ligase. This homogenous assay is a step forward in streamlining an approach for characterizing and quantitating E3 ligase activity in a rapid and cost effective manner. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Ubiquitin Drug Discovery and Diagnostics.

Abstract: New nickel oxide thin films with a micro-scale thickness and porous structure were fabricated using a sol–gel method in a mixed solvent containing N,N-dimethylaminoethanol (dmaeH) and distilled water at a 1:1 ratio. After annealing, the deposited film transformed to a well oriented, porous nickel oxide thin film. This nickel oxide thin film showed enhanced charge capacity and greater optical transmittance changes in a lithium-based electrolyte, and may be applied to WO3/Li+-based electrolyte/NiO electrochromic devices requiring long cycles.
