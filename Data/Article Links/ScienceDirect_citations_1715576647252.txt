Abstract: The present molecular investigations of Organizer phenomena show a remarkable connection to the earlier classical embryological studies that used transplantation as a method for making mechanistic models of induction. One of the most prominent of these connections is the dual gradient model for anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral polarity. This paper will discuss some of the history of how transplantation experiments provided data that could be interpreted in terms of two gradients of biologically active materials. It will highlight how the attempts to discover the elusive Induktionsstoffen gave rise to the double gradient model of Sulo Toivonen and Lauri Saxén in the 1950s and 1960s. This paper will also document how this research into the identity of these molecules gave rise to the developmental genetics that eventually would find the molecules responsible for primary embryonic induction.

Abstract: Summary
The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system is intricately organized, with respiratory complexes forming super-assembled quaternary structures whose assembly mechanisms and physiological roles remain under investigation. Cox7a2l, also known as Scaf1, facilitates complex III and complex IV (CIII-CIV) super-assembly, enhancing energetic efficiency in various species. We examined the role of Cox7a1, another Cox7a family member, in supercomplex assembly and muscle physiology. Zebrafish lacking Cox7a1 exhibited reduced CIV2 formation, metabolic alterations, and non-pathological muscle performance decline. Additionally, cox7a1−/− hearts displayed a pro-regenerative metabolic profile, impacting cardiac regenerative response. The distinct phenotypic effects of cox7a1−/− and cox7a2l−/− underscore the diverse metabolic and physiological consequences of impaired supercomplex formation, emphasizing the significance of Cox7a1 in muscle maturation within the OXPHOS system.

Abstract: Postnatal bone growth primarily relies on chondrocyte proliferation and osteogenic differentiation within the growth plate (GP) via endochondral ossification. Despite its importance, the GP is vulnerable to injuries, affecting 15–30 % of bone fractures. These injuries may lead to growth discrepancies, influence bone length and shape, and negatively affecting the patient's quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the molecular and cellular physiological and pathophysiological regeneration following sustained growth plate injury (GPI) in an ex vivo rat femur organotypic culture (OTC) model. Specifically, focusing on postnatal endochondral ossification process. 300 μm thick ex vivo bone cultures with a 2 mm long horizontal GPI was utilized. After 15 days of cultivation, gene expression analysis, histological and immunohistochemistry staining's were conducted to analyze key markers of endochondral ossification. In our OTCs we observed a significant increase in Sox9 expression due to GPI at day 15. The Ihh-PTHrP feedback loop was affected, favoring chondrocyte proliferation and maturation. Ihh levels increased significantly on day 7 and day 15, while PTHrP was downregulated on day 7. GPI had no impact on osteoclast number and activity, but gene expression analysis indicated OTCs' efforts to inhibit osteoclast differentiation and activation, thereby reducing bone resorption. In conclusion, our study provides novel insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying postnatal bone growth and regeneration following growth plate injury (GPI). We demonstrate that chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation play pivotal roles in the regeneration process, with the Ihh-PTHrP feedback loop modulating these processes. Importantly, our ex vivo rat femur organotypic culture model allows for the detailed investigation of these processes, providing a valuable tool for future research in the field of skeletal biology and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
TMEM16 proteins, also known as anoctamins, are a family of ten membrane proteins with various tissue expression and subcellular localization. TMEM16A (anoctamin 1) is a plasma membrane protein that acts as a calcium-activated chloride channel. It is expressed in many types of epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and some neurons. In airway epithelial cells, TMEM16A expression is particularly enhanced by inflammatory stimuli that also promote goblet cell metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion. Therefore, pharmacological modulation of TMEM16A could be beneficial to improve mucociliary clearance in chronic obstructive respiratory diseases. However, the correct approach to modulate TMEM16A activity (activation or inhibition) is still debated. Pharmacological inhibitors of TMEM16A could also be useful as anti-hypertensive agents given the TMEM16A role in smooth muscle contraction. In contrast to TMEM16A, TMEM16F (anoctamin 6) behaves as a calcium-activated phospholipid scramblase, responsible for the externalization of phosphatidylserine on cell surface. Inhibitors of TMEM16F could be useful as anti-coagulants and anti-viral agents. The role of other anoctamins as therapeutic targets is still unclear since their physiological role is still to be defined.

Abstract: Summary
To identify novel susceptibility genes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we performed a rare-variant association study in Chinese populations consisting of 2,750 cases and 4,153 controls. We identified four HCC-associated genes, including NRDE2, RANBP17, RTEL1, and STEAP3. Using NRDE2 (index rs199890497 [p.N377I], p = 1.19 × 10−9) as an exemplary candidate, we demonstrated that it promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair and suppresses HCC. Mechanistically, NRDE2 binds to the subunits of casein kinase 2 (CK2) and facilitates the assembly and activity of the CK2 holoenzyme. This NRDE2-mediated enhancement of CK2 activity increases the phosphorylation of MDC1 and then facilitates the HR repair. These functions are eliminated almost completely by the NRDE2-p.N377I variant, which sensitizes the HCC cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, especially when combined with chemotherapy. Collectively, our findings highlight the relevance of the rare variants to genetic susceptibility to HCC, which would be helpful for the precise treatment of this malignancy.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian brain can store and retrieve memories of related events as distinct memories and remember common features of those experiences. How it computes this function remains elusive. Here, we show in rats that recent memories of two closely timed auditory fear events share overlapping neuronal ensembles in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and are functionally linked. However, remote memories have reduced neuronal overlap and are functionally independent. The activity of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons in the BLA plays a crucial role in forming separate remote memories. Chemogenetic blockade of PV preserves individual remote memories but prevents their segregation, resulting in reciprocal associations. The hippocampus drives this process through specific excitatory connections with BLA GABAergic interneurons. These findings provide insights into the neuronal mechanisms that minimize the overlap between distinct remote memories and enable the retrieval of related memories separately.

Abstract: The effect of interleukin-38 (IL-38), a recently identified member of the IL-1 family with potential applications in various inflammation-related conditions, on ER stress has not been explored. Furthermore, its role in obesity-associated tendinopathy has not been investigated. In this study, human primary tenocytes were treated with palmitate (200 or 400 μM) and palmitate plus IL-38 (0–50 ng/mL) for 24 h. Western blotting was used to assess ER stress and tendinopathogenic markers in tenocytes. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining was used to evaluate autophagosomes. Apoptosis was determined by cell viability assays, caspase 3 activity assays and TUNEL assays. Cell migration was evaluated by a cell scratch assay. Small interfering (si) RNA transfection was used for target gene silencing. Treatment of tenocytes with IL-38 attenuated apoptosis, restored the balance between MMPs and TIMP-1, and alleviated ER stress under palmitate conditions. IL-38 treatment enhanced AMPK phosphorylation and promoted the expression of autophagy markers related to LC3 conversion, p62 degradation, and autophagosome formation in cultured tenocytes. The effects of IL-38 on ER stress, apoptosis, and MMP-9, MMP-13, and TIMP-1 expression in palmitate-treated tenocytes were abrogated by AMPK siRNA or 3-methyladenine (3MA). These results suggest that IL-38 alleviates ER stress through the AMPK/autophagy pathway, thereby reducing apoptosis and preventing extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation in tenocytes under hyperlipidemic conditions. This study provides a promising therapeutic avenue for treating obesity-related tendinopathy using an endogenous compound such as IL-38.

Abstract: Summary
Memory recall and guidance are essential for motor skill acquisition. Like humans learning to speak, male zebra finches learn to sing by first memorizing and then matching their vocalization to the tutor’s song (TS) during specific developmental periods. Yet, the neuroanatomical substrate supporting auditory-memory-guided sensorimotor learning has remained elusive. Here, using a whole-brain connectome analysis with activity-dependent viral expression, we identified a transient projection into the motor region, HVC, from neuronal ensembles responding to TS in the auditory forebrain, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), in juveniles. Virally induced cell death of the juvenile, but not adult, TS-responsive NCM neurons impaired song learning. Moreover, isolation, which delays closure of the sensory, but not the motor, learning period, did not affect the decrease of projections into the HVC from the NCM TS-responsive neurons after the song learning period. Taken together, our results suggest that dynamic axonal pruning may regulate timely auditory-memory-guided vocal learning during development.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the SRCAP gene are among the genetic alterations identified in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that Srcap+/− mice manifest deficits in social novelty response, as well as increased repetitive behaviors, anxiety, and impairments in learning and memory. Notably, a reduction in parvalbumin-positive neurons is observed in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and dentate gyrus (DG) of these mice. Through RNA sequencing, we identify dysregulation in 27 ASD-related genes in Srcap+/− mice. Specifically, we find that Srcap regulates expression of Satb2 via H2A.z in the promoter. Therapeutic intervention via retro-orbital injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-Satb2 in neonatal Srcap+/− mice leads to amelioration of the neurodevelopmental and ASD-like abnormalities. Furthermore, the expression of Satb2 only in the RSC of adolescent mice rectifies social novelty impairments. These results underscore the pivotal role of Srcap in neurodevelopment, by regulating Satb2, providing valuable insights for the pathophysiology of ASD.

Abstract: Summary
Skin damage requires efficient immune cell responses to restore organ function. Epidermal-resident immune cells known as Langerhans cells use dendritic protrusions to surveil the skin microenvironment, which contains keratinocytes and peripheral axons. The mechanisms governing Langerhans cell dendrite dynamics and responses to tissue damage are poorly understood. Using skin explants from adult zebrafish, we show that Langerhans cells maintain normal surveillance following axonal degeneration and use their dendrites to engulf small axonal debris. By contrast, a ramified-to-rounded shape transition accommodates the engulfment of larger keratinocyte debris. We find that Langerhans cell dendrites are populated with actin and sensitive to a broad-spectrum actin inhibitor. We show that Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition leads to elongated dendrites, perturbed clearance of large debris, and reduced Langerhans cell migration to epidermal wounds. Our work describes the dynamics of Langerhans cells and involvement of the ROCK pathway in immune cell responses.

Abstract: Summary
The ch12q13 locus is among the most significant childhood obesity loci identified in genome-wide association studies. This locus resides in a non-coding region within FAIM2; thus, the underlying causal variant(s) presumably influence disease susceptibility via cis-regulation. We implicated rs7132908 as a putative causal variant by leveraging our in-house 3D genomic data and public domain datasets. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we observed allele-specific cis-regulatory activity of the immediate region harboring rs7132908. We generated isogenic human embryonic stem cell lines homozygous for either rs7132908 allele to assess changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility throughout a differentiation to hypothalamic neurons, a key cell type known to regulate feeding behavior. The rs7132908 obesity risk allele influenced expression of FAIM2 and other genes and decreased the proportion of neurons produced by differentiation. We have functionally validated rs7132908 as a causal obesity variant that temporally regulates nearby effector genes and influences neurodevelopment and survival.

Abstract: Summary
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) play crucial roles in mediating allergic inflammation. Recent studies also indicate their involvement in regulating tumor immunity. The tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1) inactivating mutations are associated with a variety of human cancers; however, the role of LKB1 in ILC2 function and ILC2-mediated tumor immunity remains unknown. Here, we show that ablation of LKB1 in ILC2s results in an exhausted-like phenotype, which promotes the development of lung melanoma metastasis. Mechanistically, LKB1 deficiency leads to a marked increase in the expression of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) in ILC2s through the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cell pathway. Blockade of PD-1 can restore the effector functions of LKB1-deficient ILC2s, leading to enhanced antitumor immune responses in vivo. Together, our results reveal that LKB1 acts to restrain the exhausted state of ILC2 to maintain immune homeostasis and antitumor immunity.

Abstract: Stem cell-mediated tissue regeneration is a promising strategy for repairing tissue defects and functional reconstruction in periodontitis, a common disease that leads to the loss of alveolar bone and teeth. However, stem cell apoptosis, widely observed during tissue regeneration, impairs its efficiency. Therefore, the regulation of stem cell apoptosis is critical for improving regeneration efficiency. The LIM homeobox 8 gene LHX8, belongs to the LIM homeobox family, which was involved in tooth morphogenesis. Here, we found that LHX8 was significantly expressed in dental pulp. LHX8 knockdown significantly increased dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells (DPSCs) apoptosis, as confirmed by RT-PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, LHX8 overexpression inhibited apoptosis and enhanced the osteo/odontogenic differentiation potential of hDPSCs in vitro. Furthermore, LHX8-overexpression could enhance the periodontal tissue regeneration efficiency of hDPSCs in mice with periodontitis. In conclusion, the present study indicates that LHX8 inhibits stem cell apoptosis and promotes functional tissue formation in stem cell-based tissue regeneration engineering, suggesting a new therapeutic target to increase the efficacy of periodontal tissue regeneration.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Follicular maturation arrest is a prevalent endocrine disorder characterized by hormonal imbalance, ovarian dysfunction, and metabolic disturbances leading to Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Tanshinone IIA (TIIA), a bioactive compound derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has shown promising therapeutic potential in various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However, its effects on reproductive health and gynecological disorders, particularly PCOS, remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of TIIA on ovarian function. Using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying TIIA's pharmacological impact on ovarian function, follicular development, and androgen receptor signaling. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed that TIIA interacts with the human androgen receptor (HAR), modulating its activity and downstream signaling pathways. Our results demonstrate that TIIA treatment alleviates PCOS-like symptoms in a zebrafish model, including improved follicular development, lowered GSI index, improved antioxidant status (SOD, CAT), decreased LDH levels, and enhanced AChE levels by regulating Tox3 and Dennd1a pathway. Our findings suggest that TIIA may hold promise as a novel therapeutic agent for the management of PCOS or ovulation induction.

Abstract: Summary
Plant pathogens manipulate host development, facilitating colonization and proliferation. Ralstonia solanacearum is a soil-borne bacterial pathogen that penetrates roots and colonizes plants through the vascular system, causing wilting and death. Here, we find that RipAC, an effector protein from R. solanacearum, alters root development in Arabidopsis, promoting the formation of lateral roots and root hairs. RipAC interacts with CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA)-INTERACTIVE PROTEIN 1 (CSI1), which regulates the activity of CESA complexes at the plasma membrane. RipAC disrupts CESA-CSI1 interaction, leading to a reduction in cellulose content, root developmental alterations, and a promotion of bacterial pathogenicity. We find that CSI1 also associates with the receptor kinase FERONIA, forming a complex that negatively regulates immunity in roots; this interaction, however, is not affected by RipAC. Our work reveals a bacterial virulence strategy that selectively affects the activities of a host target, promoting anatomical alterations that facilitate infection without causing activation of immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial genome transcribes 13 mRNAs coding for well-known proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. We demonstrate here that cytochrome b (CYTB), the only mitochondrial-DNA-encoded transcript among complex III, also encodes an unrecognized 187-amino-acid-long protein, CYTB-187AA, using the standard genetic code of cytosolic ribosomes rather than the mitochondrial genetic code. After validating the existence of this mtDNA-encoded protein arising from cytosolic translation (mPACT) using mass spectrometry and antibodies, we show that CYTB-187AA is mainly localized in the mitochondrial matrix and promotes the pluripotent state in primed-to-naive transition by interacting with solute carrier family 25 member 3 (SLC25A3) to modulate ATP production. We further generated a transgenic knockin mouse model of CYTB-187AA silencing and found that reduction of CYTB-187AA impairs females’ fertility by decreasing the number of ovarian follicles. For the first time, we uncovered the novel mPACT pattern of a mitochondrial mRNA and demonstrated the physiological function of this 14th protein encoded by mtDNA.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogens target vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) to inhibit lysosomal acidification or lysosomal fusion, causing lysosomal dysfunction. However, it remains unknown whether cells can detect dysfunctional lysosomes and initiate an immune response. In this study, we discover that dysfunction of lysosomes caused by inactivation of V-ATPase enhances innate immunity against bacterial infections. We find that lysosomal V-ATPase interacts with DVE-1, whose nuclear localization serves as a proxy for the induction of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). The inactivation of V-ATPase promotes the nuclear localization of DVE-1, activating UPRmt and inducing downstream immune response genes. Furthermore, pathogen resistance conferred by inactivation of V-ATPase requires dve-1 and its downstream immune effectors. Interestingly, animals grow slower after vha RNAi, suggesting that the vha-RNAi-induced immune response costs the most energy through activation of DVE-1, which trades off with growth. This study reveals how dysfunctional lysosomes can trigger an immune response, emphasizing the importance of conserving energy during immune defense.

Abstract: Summary
Approximately 1 in 4 people worldwide have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, there are currently no medications to treat this condition. This study investigated the role of adiposity-associated orphan G protein-coupled receptor 75 (GPR75) in liver lipid accumulation. We profiled Gpr75 expression and report that it is most abundant in the brain. Next, we generated the first single-cell-level analysis of Gpr75 and identified a subpopulation co-expressed with key appetite-regulating hypothalamic neurons. CRISPR-Cas9-deleted Gpr75 mice fed a palatable western diet high in fat adjusted caloric intake to remain in energy balance, thereby preventing NAFLD. Consistent with mouse results, analysis of whole-exome sequencing data from 428,719 individuals (UK Biobank) revealed that variants in GPR75 are associated with a reduced likelihood of hepatic steatosis. Here, we provide a significant advance in understanding of the expression and function of GPR75, demonstrating that it is a promising pharmaceutical target for NAFLD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The MUC2 mucin protects the colonic epithelium by a two-layered mucus with an inner attached bacteria-free layer and an outer layer harboring commensal bacteria. CysD domains are 100 amino-acid-long sequences containing 10 cysteines that separate highly O-glycosylated proline, threonine, serine (PTS) regions in mucins. The structure of the second CysD, CysD2, of MUC2 is now solved by nuclear magnetic resonance. CysD2 shows a stable stalk region predicted to be partly covered by adjacent O-glycans attached to neighboring PTS sequences, whereas the CysD2 tip with three flexible loops is suggested to be well exposed. It shows transient dimer interactions at acidic pH, weakened at physiological pH. This transient interaction can be stabilized in vitro and in vivo by transglutaminase 3-catalyzed isopeptide bonds, preferring a specific glutamine residue on one flexible loop. This covalent dimer is modeled suggesting that CysD domains act as connecting hubs for covalent stabilization of mucins to form a protective mucus.

Abstract: Summary
Seed size is controlled not only by intrinsic genetic factors but also by external environmental signals. Here, we report a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) gene for seed size and weight on chromosome 1 (SSW1) in Arabidopsis, and we found SSW1 acts maternally to positively regulate seed size. Natural variation in SSW1 contains three types of alleles. The SSW1Cvi allele produces larger seeds with more amino acid and storage protein contents than the SSW1Ler allele. SSW1Cvi displays higher capacity for amino acid transport than SSW1Ler due to the differences in transport efficiency. Under low nitrogen supply, the SSW1Cvi allele exhibits increased seed yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Locations of natural variation alleles of SSW1 are associated with local soil nitrogen contents, suggesting that SSW1 might contribute to geographical adaptation in Arabidopsis. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism that coordinates seed growth and NUE, suggesting a potential target for improving seed yield and NUE in crops.

Abstract: Summary
Scanning and initiation are critical steps in translation. Here, we utilized translation complex profiling (TCP-seq) to investigate 48S organization and eIF4G1-eIF1 inhibition impact. We provide global views of scanning and leaky scanning, uncovering a central role of eIF4G1-eIF1 in their regulation. We confirm AUG context importance, with non-leaky genes featuring a Kozak context and cytosine at positions −1 and +5. Capturing 48S complexes associated with eIF1, eIF4G1, eIF3, and eIF2 through selective TCP-seq revealed that the eIF3-scanning ribosome is highly vulnerable to eIF4G1-eIF1 inhibition, and eIF1 tends to dissociate upon AUG recognition. Initiation-site footprint analysis revealed a class spanning −12 to +18/19 from the AUG, representing the entire 48S and enriched with eIF2, eIF1, and eIF4G1, indicative of early initiation. Another eIF3-dependent class extends up to +26 and exhibits reduced eIF2 and eIF4G1 association, suggesting a late/alternative initiation complex. Our analysis provides an overview of scanning, initiation, and evidence for conformational rearrangements in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Placental ischemia, resulting from inadequate remodeling of uterine spiral arteries, is a factor in the development of preeclampsia. However, the effect of endothelial progenitor cells that play a role in the vascular injury-repair program is largely unexplored during remodeling. Here, we observe that preeclampsia-afflicted uterine spiral arteries transition to a synthetic phenotype in vascular smooth muscle cells and characterize the regulatory axis in endothelial progenitor cells during remodeling in human decidua basalis. Excessive sEng, secreted by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-deficient endothelial progenitor cells through the inhibition of HO-1, damages residual endothelium and leads to the accumulation of extracellular matrix produced by vascular smooth muscle cells during remodeling, which is further confirmed by animal models. Collectively, our findings suggest that the impaired functionality of endothelial progenitor cells contributes to the narrowing of remodeled uterine spiral arteries, leading to reduced utero-placental perfusion. This mechanism holds promise in elucidating the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.

Abstract: Summary
Knowing the genes involved in quantitative traits provides an entry point to understanding the biological bases of behavior, but there are very few examples where the pathway from genetic locus to behavioral change is known. To explore the role of specific genes in fear behavior, we mapped three fear-related traits, tested fourteen genes at six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by quantitative complementation, and identified six genes. Four genes, Lamp, Ptprd, Nptx2, and Sh3gl, have known roles in synapse function; the fifth, Psip1, was not previously implicated in behavior; and the sixth is a long non-coding RNA, 4933413L06Rik, of unknown function. Variation in transcriptome and epigenetic modalities occurred preferentially in excitatory neurons, suggesting that genetic variation is more permissible in excitatory than inhibitory neuronal circuits. Our results relieve a bottleneck in using genetic mapping of QTLs to uncover biology underlying behavior and prompt a reconsideration of expected relationships between genetic and functional variation.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria have diverse functions critical to whole-body metabolic homeostasis. Endurance training alters mitochondrial activity, but systematic characterization of these adaptations is lacking. Here, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium mapped the temporal, multi-omic changes in mitochondrial analytes across 19 tissues in male and female rats trained for 1, 2, 4, or 8 weeks. Training elicited substantial changes in the adrenal gland, brown adipose, colon, heart, and skeletal muscle. The colon showed non-linear response dynamics, whereas mitochondrial pathways were downregulated in brown adipose and adrenal tissues. Protein acetylation increased in the liver, with a shift in lipid metabolism, whereas oxidative proteins increased in striated muscles. Exercise-upregulated networks were downregulated in human diabetes and cirrhosis. Knockdown of the central network protein 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 10 (HSD17B10) elevated oxygen consumption, indicative of metabolic stress. We provide a multi-omic, multi-tissue, temporal atlas of the mitochondrial response to exercise training and identify candidates linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome displays genetic differences among populations, and characterization of the genomic landscape of the gut microbiome in China remains limited. Here, we present the Chinese Gut Microbial Reference (CGMR) set, comprising 101,060 high-quality metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) of 3,707 nonredundant species from 3,234 fecal samples across primarily rural Chinese locations, 1,376 live isolates mainly from lactic acid bacteria, and 987 novel species relative to worldwide databases. We observed region-specific coexisting MAGs and MAGs with probiotic and cardiometabolic functionalities. Preliminary mouse experiments suggest a probiotic effect of two Faecalibacillus intestinalis isolates in alleviating constipation, cardiometabolic influences of three Bacteroides fragilis_A isolates in obesity, and isolates from the genera Parabacteroides and Lactobacillus in host lipid metabolism. Our study expands the current microbial genomes with paired isolates and demonstrates potential host effects, contributing to the mechanistic understanding of host-microbe interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Although natural killer (NK) cells are recognized for their modulation of immune responses, the mechanisms by which human NK cells mediate immune regulation are unclear. Here, we report that expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DP, a ligand for the activating NK cell receptor NKp44, is significantly upregulated on CD8+ effector T cells, in particular in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)+ individuals. HLA-DP+ CD8+ T cells expressing NKp44-binding HLA-DP antigens activate NKp44+ NK cells, while HLA-DP+ CD8+ T cells not expressing NKp44-binding HLA-DP antigens do not. In line with this, frequencies of HLA-DP+ CD8+ T cells are increased in individuals not encoding for NKp44-binding HLA-DP haplotypes, and contain hyper-expanded CD8+ T cell clones, compared to individuals expressing NKp44-binding HLA-DP molecules. These findings identify a molecular interaction facilitating the HLA-DP haplotype-specific editing of HLA-DP+ CD8+ T cell effector populations by NKp44+ NK cells and preventing the generation of hyper-expanded T cell clones, which have been suggested to have increased potential for autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
Post-translational modifications of proteins (PTMs) introduce an extra layer of complexity to cellular regulation. Although phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues is well-known as PTMs, lysine is, in fact, the most heavily modified amino acid, with over 30 types of PTMs on lysine having been characterized. One of the most recently discovered PTMs on lysine residues is polyphosphorylation, which sees linear chains of inorganic polyphosphates (polyP) attached to lysine residues. The labile nature of phosphoramidate bonds raises the question of whether this modification is covalent in nature. Here, we used buffers with very high ionic strength, which would disrupt any non-covalent interactions, and confirmed that lysine polyphosphorylation occurs covalently on proteins containing PASK domains (polyacidic, serine-, and lysine-rich), such as the budding yeast protein nuclear signal recognition 1 (Nsr1) and the mammalian protein nucleolin. This Matters Arising Response paper addresses the Neville et al. (2024) Matters Arising paper, published concurrently in Molecular Cell.

Abstract: Liver fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) as a wound healing process. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HpSCs) are the major producer of the ECM and play a central role in liver fibrogenesis. It has been widely accepted that elimination of activated HpSCs or reversion to a quiescent state can be a feasible strategy for resolving the disease, further highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. Calreticulin (CRT) is a molecular chaperone that normally resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), important in protein folding and trafficking through the secretory pathway. CRT also plays a critical role in calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis, with its Ca2+ storage capacity. In the current study, we aimed to demonstrate its function in directing HpSC activation. In a mouse liver injury model, CRT was up-regulated in HpSCs. In cellular experiments, we further showed that this activation was through modulating the canonical TGF-β signaling. As down-regulation of CRT in HpSCs elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels through a form of Ca2+ influx, named store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), we examined whether moderating SOCE affected TGF-β signaling. Interestingly, blocking SOCE had little effect on TGF-β-induced gene expression. In contrast, inhibition of ER Ca2+ release using the inositol trisphosphate receptor inhibitor 2-APB increased TGF-β signaling. Treatment with 2-APB did not alter SOCE but decreased intracellular Ca2+ at the basal level. Indeed, adjusting Ca2+ concentrations by EGTA or BAPTA-AM chelation further enhanced TGF-β-induced signaling. Our results suggest a crucial role of CRT in the liver fibrogenic process through modulating Ca2+ concentrations and TGF-β signaling in HpSCs, which may provide new information and help advance the current discoveries for liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Activating mutations in PIK3CA are frequently found in estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, and the combination of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor alpelisib with anti-ER inhibitors is approved for therapy. We have previously demonstrated that the PI3K pathway regulates ER activity through phosphorylation of the chromatin modifier KMT2D. Here, we discovered a methylation site on KMT2D, at K1330 directly adjacent to S1331, catalyzed by the lysine methyltransferase SMYD2. SMYD2 loss attenuates alpelisib-induced KMT2D chromatin binding and alpelisib-mediated changes in gene expression, including ER-dependent transcription. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of SMYD2 sensitizes breast cancer cells, patient-derived organoids, and tumors to PI3K/AKT inhibition and endocrine therapy in part through KMT2D K1330 methylation. Together, our findings uncover a regulatory crosstalk between post-translational modifications that fine-tunes KMT2D function at the chromatin. This provides a rationale for the use of SMYD2 inhibitors in combination with PI3Kα/AKT inhibitors in the treatment of ER+/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The developing peripheral nervous and immune systems are functionally distinct from those of adults. These systems are vulnerable to early-life injury, which influences outcomes related to nociception following subsequent injury later in life (i.e., “neonatal nociceptive priming”). The underpinnings of this phenomenon are unclear, although previous work indicates that macrophages are trained by inflammation and injury. Our findings show that macrophages are both necessary and partially sufficient to drive neonatal nociceptive priming, possibly due to a long-lasting remodeling in chromatin structure. The p75 neurotrophic factor receptor is an important effector in regulating neonatal nociceptive priming through modulation of the inflammatory profile of rodent and human macrophages. This “pain memory” is long lasting in females and can be transferred to a naive host to alter sex-specific pain-related behaviors. This study reveals a mechanism by which acute, neonatal post-surgical pain drives a peripheral immune-related predisposition to persistent pain following a subsequent injury.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions mediate Ca2+ flux across neuronal membranes. The properties of these membrane contact sites are defined by their lipid content, but little attention has been given to glycosphingolipids (GSLs). Here, we show that GM1-ganglioside, an abundant GSL in neuronal membranes, is integral to ER-PM junctions; it interacts with synaptic proteins/receptors and regulates Ca2+ signaling. In a model of the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease, GM1-gangliosidosis, pathogenic accumulation of GM1 at ER-PM junctions due to β-galactosidase deficiency drastically alters neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis. Mechanistically, we show that GM1 interacts with the phosphorylated N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) Ca2+ channel, thereby increasing Ca2+ flux, activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, and increasing the number of synaptic spines without increasing synaptic connectivity. Thus, GM1 clustering at ER-PM junctions alters synaptic plasticity and worsens the generalized neuronal cell death characteristic of GM1-gangliosidosis.

Abstract: Summary
Sympathetic innervation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) controls mammalian adaptative thermogenesis. However, the cellular and molecular underpinnings contributing to BAT innervation remain poorly defined. Here, we show that smooth muscle cells (SMCs) support BAT growth, lipid utilization, and thermogenic plasticity. Moreover, we find that BAT SMCs express and control the bioavailability of Cxcl12. SMC deletion of Cxcl12 fosters brown adipocyte lipid accumulation, reduces energy expenditure, and increases susceptibility to diet-induced metabolic dysfunction. Mechanistically, we find that Cxcl12 stimulates CD301+ macrophage recruitment and supports sympathetic neuronal maintenance. Administering recombinant Cxcl12 to obese mice or leptin-deficient (Ob/Ob) mice is sufficient to boost macrophage presence and drive sympathetic innervation to restore BAT morphology and thermogenic responses. Altogether, our data reveal an SMC chemokine-dependent pathway linking immunological infiltration and sympathetic innervation as a rheostat for BAT maintenance and thermogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Perivascular collagen deposition by activated fibroblasts promotes vascular stiffening and drives cardiovascular diseases such as pulmonary hypertension (PH). Whether and how vascular fibroblasts rewire their metabolism to sustain collagen biosynthesis remains unknown. Here, we found that inflammation, hypoxia, and mechanical stress converge on activating the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (WWTR1) in pulmonary arterial adventitial fibroblasts (PAAFs). Consequently, YAP and TAZ drive glutamine and serine catabolism to sustain proline and glycine anabolism and promote collagen biosynthesis. Pharmacologic or dietary intervention on proline and glycine anabolic demand decreases vascular stiffening and improves cardiovascular function in PH rodent models. By identifying the limiting metabolic pathways for vascular collagen biosynthesis, our findings provide guidance for incorporating metabolic and dietary interventions for treating cardiopulmonary vascular disease.

Abstract: Summary
The cellular source of positive signals that reinvigorate T cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) for the therapeutic efficacy of programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade has not been clearly defined. We now show that Batf3-lineage dendritic cells (DCs) are essential in this process. Flow cytometric analysis, gene-targeted mice, and blocking antibody studies revealed that 4-1BBL is a major positive co-stimulatory signal provided by these DCs within the TME that translates to CD8+ T cell functional reinvigoration and tumor regression. Immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics on human tumor samples revealed clustering of Batf3+ DCs and CD8+ T cells, which correlates with anti-PD-1 efficacy. In addition, proximity to Batf3+ DCs within the TME is associated with CD8+ T cell transcriptional states linked to anti-PD-1 response. Our results demonstrate that Batf3+ DCs within the TME are critical for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade efficacy and indicate a major role for the 4-1BB/4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) axis during this process.

Abstract: Summary
Shifts in the magnitude and nature of gut microbial metabolites have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the host receptors that sense and respond to these metabolites are largely unknown. Here, we develop a systems biology framework that integrates machine learning and multi-omics to identify molecular relationships of gut microbial metabolites with non-olfactory G-protein-coupled receptors (termed the “GPCRome”). We evaluate 1.09 million metabolite-protein pairs connecting 408 human GPCRs and 335 gut microbial metabolites. Using genetics-derived Mendelian randomization and integrative analyses of human brain transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, we identify orphan GPCRs (i.e., GPR84) as potential drug targets in AD and that triacanthine experimentally activates GPR84. We demonstrate that phenethylamine and agmatine significantly reduce tau hyperphosphorylation (p-tau181 and p-tau205) in AD patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. This study demonstrates a systems biology framework to uncover the GPCR targets of human gut microbiota in AD and other complex diseases if broadly applied.

Abstract: Summary
The sensory cortex receives synaptic inputs from both first-order and higher-order thalamic nuclei. First-order inputs relay simple stimulus properties from the periphery, whereas higher-order inputs relay more complex response properties, provide contextual feedback, and modulate plasticity. Here, we reveal that a cortical neuron’s higher-order input is determined by the type of progenitor from which it is derived during embryonic development. Within layer 4 (L4) of the mouse primary somatosensory cortex, neurons derived from intermediate progenitors receive stronger higher-order thalamic input and exhibit greater higher-order sensory responses. These effects result from differences in dendritic morphology and levels of the transcription factor Lhx2, which are specified by the L4 neuron’s progenitor type. When this mechanism is disrupted, cortical circuits exhibit altered higher-order responses and sensory-evoked plasticity. Therefore, by following distinct trajectories, progenitor types generate diversity in thalamocortical circuitry and may provide a general mechanism for differentially routing information through the cortex.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are primary defenders against cancer precursors, but cancer cells can persist by evading immune surveillance. To investigate the genetic mechanisms underlying this evasion, we perform a genome-wide CRISPR screen using B lymphoblastoid cells. SPPL3, a peptidase that cleaves glycosyltransferases in the Golgi, emerges as a top hit facilitating evasion from NK cytotoxicity. SPPL3-deleted cells accumulate glycosyltransferases and complex N-glycans, disrupting not only binding of ligands to NK receptors but also binding of rituximab, a CD20 antibody approved for treating B cell cancers. Notably, inhibiting N-glycan maturation restores receptor binding and sensitivity to NK cells. A secondary CRISPR screen in SPPL3-deficient cells identifies B3GNT2, a transferase-mediating poly-LacNAc extension, as crucial for resistance. Mass spectrometry confirms enrichment of N-glycans bearing poly-LacNAc upon SPPL3 loss. Collectively, our study shows the essential role of SPPL3 and poly-LacNAc in cancer immune evasion, suggesting a promising target for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) supports production of 11-cis-retinaldehyde and its delivery to photoreceptors. It is found in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Müller glia (MG), but the relative functional importance of these two cellular pools is debated. Here, we report RPE- and MG-specific CRALBP knockout (KO) mice and examine their photoreceptor and visual cycle function. Bulk visual chromophore regeneration in RPE-KO mice is 15-fold slower than in controls, accounting for their delayed rod dark adaptation and protection against retinal phototoxicity, whereas MG-KO mice have normal bulk visual chromophore regeneration and retinal light damage susceptibility. Cone pigment regeneration is significantly impaired in RPE-KO mice but mildly affected in MG-KO mice, disclosing an unexpectedly strong reliance of cone photoreceptors on the RPE-based visual cycle. These data reveal a dominant role for RPE-CRALBP in supporting rod and cone function and highlight the importance of RPE cell targeting for CRALBP gene therapies.

Abstract: Summary
TP53-mutant blood cancers remain a clinical challenge. BH3-mimetic drugs inhibit BCL-2 pro-survival proteins, inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Despite acting downstream of p53, functional p53 is required for maximal cancer cell killing by BH3-mimetics through an unknown mechanism. Here, we report p53 is activated following BH3-mimetic induced mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to BH3-only protein induction and thereby potentiating the pro-apoptotic signal. TP53-deficient lymphomas lack this feedforward loop, providing opportunities for survival and disease relapse after BH3-mimetic treatment. The therapeutic barrier imposed by defects in TP53 can be overcome by direct activation of the cGAS/STING pathway, which promotes apoptosis of blood cancer cells through p53-independent BH3-only protein upregulation. Combining clinically relevant STING agonists with BH3-mimetic drugs efficiently kills TRP53/TP53-mutant mouse B lymphoma, human NK/T lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia cells. This represents a promising therapy regime that can be fast-tracked to tackle TP53-mutant blood cancers in the clinic.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb (Pc) group proteins are transcriptional regulators with key roles in development, cell identity, and differentiation. Pc-bound chromatin regions form repressive domains that interact in 3D to assemble repressive nuclear compartments. Here, we use multiplexed chromatin imaging to investigate whether Pc compartments involve the clustering of multiple Pc domains during Drosophila development. Notably, 3D proximity between Pc targets is rare and involves predominantly pairwise interactions. These 3D proximities are particularly enhanced in segments where Pc genes are co-repressed. In addition, segment-specific expression of Hox Pc targets leads to their spatial segregation from Pc-repressed genes. Finally, non-Hox Pc targets are more proximal in regions where they are co-expressed. These results indicate that long-range Pc interactions are temporally and spatially regulated during differentiation and development but do not induce frequent clustering of multiple distant Pc genes.

Abstract: TRPV2 voltage-insensitive, calcium-permeable ion channels play important roles in cancer progression, immune response, and neuronal development. Despite TRPV2’s physiological impact, underlying endogenous proteins mediating TRPV2 responses and affected signaling pathways remain elusive. Using quantitative peroxidase-catalyzed (APEX2) proximity proteomics we uncover dynamic changes in the TRPV2-proximal proteome and identify calcium signaling and cell adhesion factors recruited to the molecular channel neighborhood in response to activation. Quantitative TRPV2 proximity proteomics further revealed activation-induced enrichment of protein clusters with biological functions in neural and cellular projection. We demonstrate a functional connection between TRPV2 and the neural immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecules NCAM and L1CAM. NCAM and L1CAM stimulation robustly induces TRPV2 [Ca2+]I flux in neuronal PC12 cells and this TRPV2-specific [Ca2+]I flux requires activation of the protein kinase PKCα. TRPV2 expression directly impacts neurite lengths that are modulated by NCAM or L1CAM stimulation. Hence, TRPV2’s calcium signaling plays a previously undescribed, yet vital role in cell adhesion, and TRPV2 calcium flux and neurite development are intricately linked via NCAM and L1CAM cell adhesion proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Interneurons (INs), specifically those in disinhibitory circuits like somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-INs, are strongly modulated by the behavioral context. Yet, the mechanisms by which these INs are recruited during active states and whether their activity is consistent across sensory cortices remain unclear. We now report that in mice, locomotor activity strongly recruits SST-INs in the primary somatosensory (S1) but not the visual (V1) cortex. This diverse engagement of SST-INs cannot be explained by differences in VIP-IN function but is absent in the presence of visual input, suggesting the involvement of feedforward sensory pathways. Accordingly, inactivating the somatosensory thalamus, but not decreasing VIP-IN activity, significantly reduces the modulation of SST-INs by locomotion. Model simulations suggest that the differences in SST-INs across behavioral states can be explained by varying ratios of VIP- and thalamus-driven activity. By integrating feedforward activity with neuromodulation, SST-INs are anticipated to be crucial for adapting sensory processing to behavioral states.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene are associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Loss of PTEN leads to hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which functions in two distinct protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The downstream signaling mechanisms that contribute to PTEN mutant phenotypes are not well delineated. Here, we show that pluripotent stem cell-derived PTEN mutant human neurons, neural precursors, and cortical organoids recapitulate disease-relevant phenotypes, including hypertrophy, electrical hyperactivity, enhanced proliferation, and structural overgrowth. PTEN loss leads to simultaneous hyperactivation of mTORC1 and mTORC2. We dissect the contribution of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by generating double mutants of PTEN and RPTOR or RICTOR, respectively. Our results reveal that the synergistic hyperactivation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 is essential for the PTEN mutant human neural phenotypes. Together, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie PTEN-related neural disorders and highlight novel therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
The efficacy of immunotherapy against colorectal cancer (CRC) is impaired by insufficient immune cell recruitment into the tumor microenvironment. Our study shows that targeting circDNA2v, a circular RNA commonly overexpressed in CRC, can be exploited to elicit cytotoxic T cell recruitment. circDNA2v functions through binding to IGF2BP3, preventing its ubiquitination, and prolonging the IGF2BP3 half-life, which in turn sustains mRNA levels of the protooncogene c-Myc. Targeting circDNA2v by gene silencing downregulates c-Myc to concordantly induce tumor cell senescence and the release of proinflammatory mediators. Production of CXCL10 and interleukin-9 by CRC cells is elicited through JAK-STAT1 signaling, in turn promoting the chemotactic and cytolytic activities of CD8+ T cells. Clinical evidence associates increased circDNA2v expression in CRC tissues with reductions in CD8+ T cell infiltration and worse outcomes. The regulatory relationship between circDNA2v, cellular senescence, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes thus provides a rational approach for improving immunotherapy in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Women are more vulnerable to stress and have a higher likelihood of developing mood disorders. The serotonin (5HT) system has been highly implicated in stress response and mood regulation. However, sex-dependent mechanisms underlying serotonergic regulation of stress vulnerability remain poorly understood. Here, we report that adult hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) of the Ascl1 lineage (Ascl1-NSCs) in female mice express functional 5HT1A receptors (5HT1ARs), and selective deletion of 5HT1ARs in Ascl1-NSCs decreases the Ascl1-NSC pool only in females. Mechanistically, 5HT1AR deletion in Ascl1-NSCs of females leads to 5HT-induced depolarization mediated by upregulation of 5HT7Rs. Furthermore, repeated restraint stress (RRS) impairs Ascl1-NSC maintenance through a 5HT1AR-mediated mechanism. By contrast, Ascl1-NSCs in males express 5HT7R receptors (5HT7Rs) that are downregulated by RRS, thus maintaining the Ascl1-NSC pool. These findings suggest that sex-specific expression of distinct 5HTRs and their differential interactions with stress may underlie sex differences in stress vulnerability.

Abstract: Summary
Glucocorticoids have been used for decades to treat lymphomas without an established mechanism of action. Using functional genomic, proteomic, and chemical screens, we discover that glucocorticoids inhibit oncogenic signaling by the B cell receptor (BCR), a recurrent feature of aggressive B cell malignancies, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma. Glucocorticoids induce the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to directly transactivate genes encoding negative regulators of BCR stability (LAPTM5; KLHL14) and the PI3 kinase pathway (INPP5D; DDIT4). GR directly represses transcription of CSK, a kinase that limits the activity of BCR-proximal Src-family kinases. CSK inhibition attenuates the constitutive BCR signaling of lymphomas by hyperactivating Src-family kinases, triggering their ubiquitination and degradation. With the knowledge that glucocorticoids disable oncogenic BCR signaling, they can now be deployed rationally to treat BCR-dependent aggressive lymphomas and used to construct mechanistically sound combination regimens with inhibitors of BTK, PI3 kinase, BCL2, and CSK.

Abstract: Summary
Cytidine acetylation (ac4C) of RNA is a post-transcriptional modification catalyzed by Nat10. Recently, an approach termed RedaC:T was employed to map ac4C in human mRNA, relying on detection of C>T mutations in WT but not in Nat10-KO cells. RedaC:T suggested widespread ac4C presence. Here, we reanalyze RedaC:T data. We find that mismatch signatures are not reproducible, as C>T mismatches are nearly exclusively present in only one of two biological replicates. Furthermore, all mismatch types—not only C>T—are highly enriched in WT samples, inconsistent with an acetylation signature. We demonstrate that the originally observed enrichment in mutations in one of the WT samples is due to its low complexity, resulting in the technical amplification of all classes of mismatch counts. Removal of duplicate reads abolishes the skewed mismatch patterns. These analyses account for the irreproducible mismatch patterns across samples while failing to find evidence for acetylation of RedaC:T sites.

Abstract: Summary
The maintenance of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells underlies the efficacy of vaccines and immunotherapies. Pathways contributing to CD8+ T cell loss are not completely understood. Uncovering the pathways underlying the limited persistence of CD8+ T cells would be of significant benefit for developing novel strategies of promoting T cell persistence. Here, we demonstrate that murine CD8+ T cells experience endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress following activation and that the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) adapter Sel1L is induced in activated CD8+ T cells. Sel1L loss limits CD8+ T cell function and memory formation following acute viral infection. Mechanistically, Sel1L is required for optimal bioenergetics and c-Myc expression. Finally, we demonstrate that human CD8+ T cells experience ER stress upon activation and that ER stress is negatively associated with improved T cell functionality in T cell-redirecting therapies. Together, these results demonstrate that ER stress and ERAD are important regulators of T cell function and persistence.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in sound-evoked responses in the auditory cortex (ACtx) occur during learning, but how learning alters neural responses in different ACtx subregions and changes their interactions is unclear. To address these questions, we developed an automated training and widefield imaging system to longitudinally track the neural activity of all mouse ACtx subregions during a tone discrimination task. We find that responses in primary ACtx are highly informative of learned stimuli and behavioral outcomes throughout training. In contrast, representations of behavioral outcomes in the dorsal posterior auditory field, learned stimuli in the dorsal anterior auditory field, and inter-regional correlations between primary and higher-order areas are enhanced with training. Moreover, ACtx response changes vary between stimuli, and such differences display lag synchronization with the learning rate. These results indicate that learning alters functional connections between ACtx subregions, inducing region-specific modulations by propagating behavioral information from primary to higher-order areas.

Abstract: Summary
Insulin-PI3K signaling controls insulin secretion. Understanding this feedback mechanism is crucial for comprehending how insulin functions. However, the role of adipocyte insulin-PI3K signaling in controlling insulin secretion in vivo remains unclear. Using adipocyte-specific PI3Kα knockout mice (PI3KαAdQ) and a panel of isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors, we show that PI3Kα and PI3Kβ activities are functionally redundant in adipocyte insulin signaling. PI3Kβ-selective inhibitors have no effect on adipocyte AKT phosphorylation in control mice but blunt it in adipocytes of PI3KαAdQ mice, demonstrating adipocyte-selective pharmacological PI3K inhibition in the latter. Acute adipocyte-selective PI3K inhibition increases serum free fatty acid (FFA) and potently induces insulin secretion. We name this phenomenon the adipoincretin effect. The adipoincretin effect operates in fasted mice with increasing FFA and decreasing glycemia, indicating that it is not primarily a control system for blood glucose. This feedback control system defines the rates of adipose tissue lipolysis and chiefly controls basal insulin secretion during fasting.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis (5-year survival rate of 30.5% in the United States). Designing cell therapies to target AML is challenging because no single tumor-associated antigen (TAA) is highly expressed on all cancer subpopulations. Furthermore, TAAs are also expressed on healthy cells, leading to toxicity risk. To address these targeting challenges, we engineer natural killer (NK) cells with a multi-input gene circuit consisting of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) controlled by OR and NOT logic gates. The OR gate kills a range of AML cells from leukemic stem cells to blasts using a bivalent CAR targeting FLT3 and/or CD33. The NOT gate protects healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) using an inhibitory CAR targeting endomucin, a protective antigen unique to healthy HSCs. NK cells with the combined OR-NOT gene circuit kill multiple AML subtypes and protect primary HSCs, and the circuit also works in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Photoperiod sensitivity is crucial for soybean flowering, adaptation, and yield. In soybean, photoperiod sensitivity centers around the evening complex (EC) that regulates the transcriptional level of the core transcription factor E1, thereby regulating flowering. However, little is known about the regulation of the activity of EC. Our study identifies how E2/GIGANTEA (GI) and its homologs modulate photoperiod sensitivity through interactions with the EC. During long days, E2 interacts with the blue-light receptor flavin-binding, kelch repeat, F box 1 (FKF1), leading to the degradation of J/ELF3, an EC component. EC also suppresses E2 expression by binding to its promoter. This interplay forms a photoperiod regulatory loop, maintaining sensitivity to photoperiod. Disruption of this loop leads to losing sensitivity, affecting soybean’s adaptability and yield. Understanding this loop’s dynamics is vital for molecular breeding to reduce soybean’s photoperiod sensitivity and develop cultivars with better adaptability and higher yields, potentially leading to the creation of photoperiod-insensitive varieties for broader agricultural applications.

Abstract: Summary
Alterations of bases in DNA constitute a major source of genomic instability. It is believed that base alterations trigger base excision repair (BER), generating DNA repair intermediates interfering with DNA replication. Here, we show that genomic uracil, a common type of base alteration, induces DNA replication stress (RS) without being processed by BER. In the absence of uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG), genomic uracil accumulates to high levels, DNA replication forks slow down, and PrimPol-mediated repriming is enhanced, generating single-stranded gaps in nascent DNA. ATR inhibition in UNG-deficient cells blocks the repair of uracil-induced gaps, increasing replication fork collapse and cell death. Notably, a subset of cancer cells upregulates UNG2 to suppress genomic uracil and limit RS, and these cancer cells are hypersensitive to co-treatment with ATR inhibitors and drugs increasing genomic uracil. These results reveal unprocessed genomic uracil as an unexpected source of RS and a targetable vulnerability of cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cis-regulatory elements control transcription levels, temporal dynamics, and cell-cell variation or transcriptional noise. However, the combination of regulatory features that control these different attributes is not fully understood. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq during an estrogen treatment time course and machine learning to identify predictors of expression timing and noise. We found that genes with multiple active enhancers exhibit faster temporal responses. We verified this finding by showing that manipulation of enhancer activity changes the temporal response of estrogen target genes. Analysis of transcriptional noise uncovered a relationship between promoter and enhancer activity, with active promoters associated with low noise and active enhancers linked to high noise. Finally, we observed that co-expression across single cells is an emergent property associated with chromatin looping, timing, and noise. Overall, our results indicate a fundamental tradeoff between a gene’s ability to quickly respond to incoming signals and maintain low variation across cells.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) carries a dismal prognosis due to therapeutic resistance. We show that PDAC cells undergo global epigenetic reprogramming to acquire chemoresistance, a process that is driven at least in part by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). Genetic or pharmacological PRMT1 inhibition impairs adaptive epigenetic reprogramming and delays acquired resistance to gemcitabine and other common chemo drugs. Mechanistically, gemcitabine treatment induces translocation of PRMT1 into the nucleus, where its enzymatic activity limits the assembly of chromatin-bound MAFF/BACH1 transcriptional complexes. Cut&Tag chromatin profiling of H3K27Ac, MAFF, and BACH1 suggests a pivotal role for MAFF/BACH1 in global epigenetic response to gemcitabine, which is confirmed by genetically silencing MAFF. PRMT1 and MAFF/BACH1 signature genes identified by Cut&Tag analysis distinguish gemcitabine-resistant from gemcitabine-sensitive patient-derived xenografts of PDAC, supporting the PRMT1-MAFF/BACH1 epigenetic regulatory axis as a potential therapeutic avenue for improving the efficacy and durability of chemotherapies in patients of PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
Atg8 paralogs, consisting of LC3A/B/C and GBRP/GBRPL1/GATE16, function in canonical autophagy; however, their function is controversial because of functional redundancy. In innate immunity, xenophagy and non-canonical single membranous autophagy called “conjugation of Atg8s to single membranes” (CASM) eliminate bacteria in various cells. Previously, we reported that intracellular Streptococcus pneumoniae can induce unique hierarchical autophagy comprised of CASM induction, shedding, and subsequent xenophagy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes and the biological significance of transient CASM induction remain unknown. Herein, we profile the relationship between Atg8s, autophagy receptors, poly-ubiquitin, and Atg4 paralogs during pneumococcal infection to understand the driving principles of hierarchical autophagy and find that GATE16 and GBRP sequentially play a pivotal role in CASM shedding and subsequent xenophagy induction, respectively, and LC3A and GBRPL1 are involved in CASM/xenophagy induction. Moreover, we reveal ingenious bacterial tactics to gain intracellular survival niches by manipulating CASM-xenophagy progression by generating intracellular pneumococci-derived H2O2.

Abstract: Summary
Many multi-spanning membrane proteins contain poorly hydrophobic transmembrane domains (pTMDs) protected from phospholipid in mature structure. Nascent pTMDs are difficult for translocon to recognize and insert. How pTMDs are discerned and packed into mature, muti-spanning configuration remains unclear. Here, we report that pTMD elicits a post-translational topogenesis pathway for its recognition and integration. Using six-spanning protein adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2) and cultured human cells as models, we show that ABCG2’s pTMD2 can pass through translocon into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, yielding an intermediate with inserted yet mis-oriented downstream TMDs. After translation, the intermediate recruits P5A-ATPase ATP13A1, which facilitates TMD re-orientation, allowing further folding and the integration of the remaining lumen-exposed pTMD2. Depleting ATP13A1 or disrupting pTMD-characteristic residues arrests intermediates with mis-oriented and exposed TMDs. Our results explain how a “difficult” pTMD is co-translationally skipped for insertion and post-translationally buried into the final correct structure at the late folding stage to avoid excessive lipid exposure.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza A virus subtype H2N2, which caused the 1957 influenza pandemic, remains a global threat. A recent phase 1 clinical trial investigating a ferritin nanoparticle vaccine displaying H2 hemagglutinin (HA) in H2-naive and H2-exposed adults enabled us to perform comprehensive structural and biochemical characterization of immune memory on the breadth and diversity of the polyclonal serum antibody response elicited. We temporally map the epitopes targeted by serum antibodies after vaccine prime and boost, revealing that previous H2 exposure results in higher responses to the variable HA head domain. In contrast, initial responses in H2-naive participants are dominated by antibodies targeting conserved epitopes. We use cryoelectron microscopy and monoclonal B cell isolation to describe the molecular details of cross-reactive antibodies targeting conserved epitopes on the HA head, including the receptor-binding site and a new site of vulnerability deemed the medial junction. Our findings accentuate the impact of pre-existing influenza exposure on serum antibody responses post-vaccination.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase α (PI3Kα) is a heterodimer of p110α catalytic and p85 adaptor subunits that is activated by agonist-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinases. Although p85α recruits p110α to activated receptors on membranes, p85α loss, which occurs commonly in cancer, paradoxically promotes agonist-stimulated PI3K/Akt signaling. p110α localizes to microtubules via microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4), facilitating its interaction with activated receptor kinases on endosomes to initiate PI3K/Akt signaling. Here, we demonstrate that in response to agonist stimulation and p85α knockdown, the residual p110α, coupled predominantly to p85β, exhibits enhanced recruitment with receptor tyrosine kinases to endosomes. Moreover, the p110α C2 domain binds PI3-phosphate, and this interaction is also required to recruit p110α to endosomes and for PI3K/Akt signaling. Stable knockdown of p85α, which mimics the reduced p85α levels observed in cancer, enhances cell growth and tumorsphere formation, and these effects are abrogated by MAP4 or p85β knockdown, underscoring their role in the tumor-promoting activity of p85α loss.

Abstract: Summary
Butterfly wings display a diversity of cell types, including large polyploid scale cells, yet the molecular basis of such diversity is poorly understood. To explore scale cell diversity at a transcriptomic level, we employ single-cell RNA sequencing of ∼5,200 large cells (>6 μm) from 22.5- to 25-h male pupal forewings of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Using unsupervised clustering, followed by in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and CRISPR-Cas9 editing of candidate genes, we annotate various cell types on the wing. We identify genes marking non-innervated scale cells, pheromone-producing glandular cells, and innervated sensory cell types. We show that senseless, a zinc-finger transcription factor, and HR38, a hormone receptor, determine the identity, size, and color of different scale cell types and are important regulators of scale cell differentiation. This dataset and the identification of various wing cell-type markers provide a foundation to compare and explore scale cell-type diversification across arthropod species.

Abstract: Summary
Optimal activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein is crucial for host defenses against pathogens and avoiding detrimental effects. Various post-translational modifications control STING activity. However, the function of interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 modification (ISGylation) in controlling STING stability and activation is unclear. Here, we show that the E3 ISGylation ligases HECT domain- and RCC1-like domain-containing proteins (HERCs; HERC5 in humans and HERC6 in mice) facilitate STING activation by mediating ISGylation of STING at K150, preventing its K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation. Concordantly, Herc6 deficiency suppresses herpes simplex virus 1 infection-induced type I IFN responses and facilitates viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 protein papain-like protease cleaves HERC5-mediated ISGylation of STING, suppressing host antiviral responses. These data identify a mechanism by which HERCs-mediated ISGylation controls STING stability and activation and uncover the correlations and interactions of ISGylation and ubiquitination during STING activation.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of O-GlcNAcylation has emerged as a potential biomarker for several diseases, particularly cancer. The role of OGT (O-GlcNAc transferase) in maintaining O-GlcNAc homeostasis has been extensively studied; nevertheless, the regulation of OGA (O-GlcNAcase) in cancer remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that the multifunctional protein RBM14 is a regulator of cellular O-GlcNAcylation. By investigating the correlation between elevated O-GlcNAcylation and increased RBM14 expression in lung cancer cells, we discovered that RBM14 promotes ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of OGA, ultimately mediating cellular O-GlcNAcylation levels. In addition, RBM14 itself is O-GlcNAcylated at serine 521, regulating its interaction with the E3 ligase TRIM33, consequently affecting OGA protein stability. Moreover, we demonstrated that mutation of serine 521 to alanine abrogated the oncogenic properties of RBM14. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism for the regulation of OGA and suggest a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancers with dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal endosomal and lysosomal abnormalities are among the early changes observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) before plaques appear. However, it is unclear whether distinct endolysosomal defects are temporally organized and how altered γ-secretase function or amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism contribute to these changes. Inhibiting γ-secretase chronically, in mouse embryonic fibroblast and hippocampal neurons, led to a gradual endolysosomal collapse initiated by decreased lysosomal calcium and increased cholesterol, causing downstream defects in endosomal recycling and maturation. This endolysosomal demise is γ-secretase dependent, requires membrane-tethered APP cytoplasmic domains, and is rescued by APP depletion. APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) localized to late endosome/lysosome-endoplasmic reticulum contacts; an excess of APP-CTFs herein reduced lysosomal Ca2+ refilling from the endoplasmic reticulum, promoting cholesterol accretion. Tonic regulation by APP-CTFs provides a mechanistic explanation for their cellular toxicity: failure to timely degrade APP-CTFs sustains downstream signaling, instigating lysosomal dyshomeostasis, as observed in prodromal AD. This is the opposite of substrates such as Notch, which require intramembrane proteolysis to initiate signaling.

Abstract: Summary
In mice, skin-resident type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) exhibit some ILC3-like characteristics. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we observed lower expression of the ILC2 master regulator GATA3 specifically in cutaneous ILC2s (cILC2s) compared with canonical ILC2s, in line with its functionally divergent role in transcriptional control in cILC2s. Decreased levels of GATA3 enabled the expansion of RORγt fate-mapped (RORγtfm+) cILC2s after postnatal days, displaying certain similarities to ILC3s. Single-cell trajectory analysis showed a sequential promotion of the RORγtfm+ cILC2 divergency by RORγt and GATA3. Notably, during hair follicle recycling, these RORγtfm+ cILC2s accumulated around the hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) region to facilitate the process. Mechanistically, we found that GATA3-mediated integrin α3β1 upregulation on RORγtfm+ cILC2s was required for their positioning around the DP. Overall, our study demonstrates a distinct regulatory role of GATA3 in cILC2s, particularly in promoting the divergence of RORγtfm+ cILC2s to facilitate hair follicle recycling.

Abstract: Sepsis-induced acute lung injury is a common and severe complication of sepsis, for which effective treatments are currently lacking. Previous studies have demonstrated the influence of wogonin in treating acute lung injury (ALI). However, its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. To delve deeper into the mechanisms underlying wogonin's impacts in sepsis-induced acute lung injury, we established a mouse sepsis model through cecal ligation and puncture and conducted further cell experiments using lipopolysaccharide-treated MH-S and MLE-12 cells to explore wogonin's potential mechanisms of action in treating ALI. Our results revealed that wogonin significantly increased the survival rate of mice, alleviated pulmonary pathological damage and inflammatory cell infiltration, and activated the SIRT1-FOXO1 pathway. Additionally, wogonin suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory factors by M1 macrophages and induced the activation of M2 anti-inflammatory factors. Further in vitro studies confirmed that wogonin effectively inhibited M1 macrophage polarization through the activation of the SIRT1-FOXO1 pathway, thereby mitigating lung pathological changes caused by ALI. In summary, our study demonstrated that wogonin regulated macrophage M1/M2 polarization through the activation of the SIRT1-FOXO1 pathway, thereby attenuating the inflammatory response and improving pulmonary pathological changes induced by sepsis-induced ALI. This discovery provided a solid mechanistic foundation for the therapeutic use of wogonin in sepsis-induced ALI, shedding new light on potential strategies for the treatment of sepsis-induced ALI.

Abstract: Summary
Photomorphogenesis is a light-dependent plant growth and development program. As the core regulator of photomorphogenesis, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) is affected by dynamic changes in its transcriptional activity and protein stability; however, little is known about the mediators of these processes. Here, we identified PHOTOREGULATORY PROTEIN KINASE 1 (PPK1), which interacts with and phosphorylates HY5 in Arabidopsis, as one such mediator. The phosphorylation of HY5 by PPK1 is essential to establish high-affinity binding with B-BOX PROTEIN 24 (BBX24) and CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), which inhibit the transcriptional activity and promote the degradation of HY5, respectively. As such, PPKs regulate not only the binding of HY5 to its target genes under light conditions but also HY5 degradation when plants are transferred from light to dark. Our data identify a PPK-mediated phospho-code on HY5 that integrates the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of HY5 to precisely control plant photomorphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
To better understand inter-individual variation in sensitivity of DNA methylation (DNAm) to immune activity, we characterized effects of inflammatory stimuli on primary monocyte DNAm (n = 190). We find that monocyte DNAm is site-dependently sensitive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), with LPS-induced demethylation occurring following hydroxymethylation. We identify 7,359 high-confidence immune-modulated CpGs (imCpGs) that differ in genomic localization and transcription factor usage according to whether they represent a gain or loss in DNAm. Demethylated imCpGs are profoundly enriched for enhancers and colocalize to genes enriched for disease associations, especially cancer. DNAm is age associated, and we find that 24-h LPS exposure triggers approximately 6 months of gain in epigenetic age, directly linking epigenetic aging with innate immune activity. By integrating LPS-induced changes in DNAm with genetic variation, we identify 234 imCpGs under local genetic control. Exploring shared causal loci between LPS-induced DNAm responses and human disease traits highlights examples of disease-associated loci that modulate imCpG formation.

Abstract: A vasculature network supplies blood to feather buds in the developing skin. Does the vasculature network during early skin development form by sequential sprouting from the central vasculature or does local vasculogenesis occur first that then connect with the central vascular tree? Using transgenic Japanese quail Tg(TIE1p.H2B-eYFP), we observe that vascular progenitor cells appear after feather primordia formation. The vasculature then radiates out from each bud and connects with primordial vessels from neighboring buds. Later they connect with the central vasculature. Epithelial-mesenchymal recombination shows local vasculature is patterned by the epithelium, which expresses FGF2 and VEGF. Perturbing noggin expression leads to abnormal vascularization. To study endothelial origin, we compare transcriptomes of TIE1p.H2B-eYFP+ cells collected from the skin and aorta. Endothelial cells from the skin more closely resemble skin dermal cells than those from the aorta. The results show developing chicken skin vasculature is assembled by (1) physiological vasculogenesis from the peripheral tissue, and (2) subsequently connects with the central vasculature. The work implies mesenchymal plasticity and convergent differentiation play significant roles in development, and such processes may be re-activated during adult regeneration.
Summary statement
We show the vasculature network in the chicken skin is assembled using existing feather buds as the template, and endothelia are derived from local bud dermis and central vasculature.

Abstract: Summary
The locomotor role of dopaminergic neurons is traditionally attributed to their ascending projections to the basal ganglia, which project to the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). In addition, descending dopaminergic projections to the MLR are present from basal vertebrates to mammals. However, the neurons targeted in the MLR and their behavioral role are unknown in mammals. Here, we identify genetically defined MLR cells that express D1 or D2 receptors and control different motor behaviors in mice. In the cuneiform nucleus, D1-expressing neurons promote locomotion, while D2-expressing neurons stop locomotion. In the pedunculopontine nucleus, D1-expressing neurons promote locomotion, while D2-expressing neurons evoke ipsilateral turns. Using RNAscope, we show that MLR dopamine-sensitive neurons comprise a combination of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons, suggesting that different neurotransmitter-based cell types work together to control distinct behavioral modules. Altogether, our study uncovers behaviorally relevant cell types in the mammalian MLR based on the expression of dopaminergic receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable hematological malignancy demanding innovative therapeutic strategies. Targeting MYC, the notorious yet traditionally undruggable oncogene, presents an appealing avenue. Here, using a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identify the WNK lysine-deficient protein kinase 1 (WNK1) as a regulator of MYC expression in MM cells. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of WNK1 reduces MYC expression and, further, disrupts the MYC-dependent transcriptional program. Mechanistically, WNK1 inhibition attenuates the activity of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) enhancer, thus reducing MYC transcription when this locus is translocated near the MYC locus. WNK1 inhibition profoundly impacts MM cell behaviors, leading to growth inhibition, cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. Importantly, the WNK inhibitor WNK463 inhibits MM growth in primary patient samples as well as xenograft mouse models and exhibits synergistic effects with various anti-MM compounds. Collectively, our study uncovers WNK1 as a potential therapeutic target in MM.

Abstract: Summary
Implantable electrode arrays are powerful tools for directly interrogating neural circuitry in the brain, but implementing this technology in the spinal cord in behaving animals has been challenging due to the spinal cord’s significant motion with respect to the vertebral column during behavior. Consequently, the individual and ensemble activity of spinal neurons processing motor commands remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that custom ultraflexible 1-μm-thick polyimide nanoelectronic threads can conduct laminar recordings of many neuronal units within the lumbar spinal cord of unrestrained, freely moving mice. The extracellular action potentials have high signal-to-noise ratio, exhibit well-isolated feature clusters, and reveal diverse patterns of activity during locomotion. Furthermore, chronic recordings demonstrate the stable tracking of single units and their functional tuning over multiple days. This technology provides a path for elucidating how spinal circuits compute motor actions.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer progression is a complex process involving interactions that unfold across molecular, cellular, and tissue scales. These multiscale interactions have been difficult to measure and to simulate. Here, we integrated CODEX multiplexed tissue imaging with multiscale modeling software to model key action points that influence the outcome of T cell therapies with cancer. The initial phenotype of therapeutic T cells influences the ability of T cells to convert tumor cells to an inflammatory, anti-proliferative phenotype. This T cell phenotype could be preserved by structural reprogramming to facilitate continual tumor phenotype conversion and killing. One takeaway is that controlling the rate of cancer phenotype conversion is critical for control of tumor growth. The results suggest new design criteria and patient selection metrics for T cell therapies, call for a rethinking of T cell therapeutic implementation, and provide a foundation for synergistically integrating multiplexed imaging data with multiscale modeling of the cancer-immune interface. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors (TFs) are important mediators of aberrant transcriptional programs in cancer cells. In this study, we focus on TF activity (TFa) as a biomarker for cell-line-selective anti-proliferative effects, in that high TFa predicts sensitivity to loss of function of a given gene (i.e., genetic dependencies [GDs]). Our linear-regression-based framework identifies 3,047 pan-cancer and 3,952 cancer-type-specific candidate TFa-GD associations from cell line data, which are then cross-examined for impact on survival in patient cohorts. One of the most prominent biomarkers is TEAD1 activity, whose associations with its predicted GDs are validated through experimental evidence as proof of concept. Overall, these TFa-GD associations represent an attractive resource for identifying innovative, biomarker-driven hypotheses for drug discovery programs in oncology.

Abstract: Summary
The fine control of synaptic function requires robust trans-synaptic molecular interactions. However, it remains poorly understood how trans-synaptic bridges change to reflect the functional states of the synapse. Here, we develop optical tools to visualize in firing synapses the molecular behavior of two trans-synaptic proteins, LGI1 and ADAM23, and find that neuronal activity acutely rearranges their abundance at the synaptic cleft. Surprisingly, synaptic LGI1 is primarily not secreted, as described elsewhere, but exo- and endocytosed through its interaction with ADAM23. Activity-driven translocation of LGI1 facilitates the formation of trans-synaptic connections proportionally to the history of activity of the synapse, adjusting excitatory transmission to synaptic firing rates. Accordingly, we find that patient-derived autoantibodies against LGI1 reduce its surface fraction and cause increased glutamate release. Our findings suggest that LGI1 abundance at the synaptic cleft can be acutely remodeled and serves as a critical control point for synaptic function.

Abstract: Summary
We describe a strategy that combines histologic and molecular mapping that permits interrogation of the chronology of changes associated with cancer development on a whole-organ scale. Using this approach, we present the sequence of alterations around RB1 in the development of bladder cancer. We show that RB1 is not involved in initial expansion of the preneoplastic clone. Instead, we found a set of contiguous genes that we term “forerunner” genes whose silencing is associated with the development of plaque-like field effects initiating carcinogenesis. Specifically, we identified five candidate forerunner genes (ITM2B, LPAR6, MLNR, CAB39L, and ARL11) mapping near RB1. Two of these genes, LPAR6 and CAB39L, are preferentially downregulated in the luminal and basal subtypes of bladder cancer, respectively. Their loss of function dysregulates urothelial differentiation, sensitizing the urothelium to N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine-induced cancers, which recapitulate the luminal and basal subtypes of human bladder cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Cells have robust wound repair systems to prevent further damage or infection and to quickly restore cell cortex integrity when exposed to mechanical and chemical stress. Actomyosin ring formation and contraction at the wound edge are major events during closure of the plasma membrane and underlying cytoskeleton during cell wound repair. Here, we show that all five Drosophila Septins are required for efficient cell wound repair. Based on their different recruitment patterns and knockdown/mutant phenotypes, two distinct Septin complexes, Sep1/Sep2/Pnut and Sep4/Sep5/Pnut, are assembled to regulate actin ring assembly, contraction, and remodeling during the repair process. Intriguingly, we find that these two Septin complexes have different F-actin bending activities. In addition, we find that Anillin regulates the recruitment of only one of two Septin complexes upon wounding. Our results demonstrate that two functionally distinct Septin complexes work side by side to discretely regulate actomyosin ring dynamics during cell wound repair.

Abstract: Summary
During cell fate transitions, cells remodel their transcriptome, chromatin, and epigenome; however, it has been difficult to determine the temporal dynamics and cause-effect relationship between these changes at the single-cell level. Here, we employ the heterokaryon-mediated reprogramming system as a single-cell model to dissect key temporal events during early stages of pluripotency conversion using super-resolution imaging. We reveal that, following heterokaryon formation, the somatic nucleus undergoes global chromatin decompaction and removal of repressive histone modifications H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 without acquisition of active modifications H3K4me3 and H3K9ac. The pluripotency gene OCT4 (POU5F1) shows nascent and mature RNA transcription within the first 24 h after cell fusion without requiring an initial open chromatin configuration at its locus. NANOG, conversely, has significant nascent RNA transcription only at 48 h after cell fusion but, strikingly, exhibits genomic reopening early on. These findings suggest that the temporal relationship between chromatin compaction and gene activation during cellular reprogramming is gene context dependent.

Abstract: Summary
Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) after fertilization enables the maternal-to-zygotic transition. However, the global view of ZGA, particularly at initiation, is incompletely understood. Here, we develop a method to capture and sequence newly synthesized RNA in early mouse embryos, providing a view of transcriptional reprogramming during ZGA. Our data demonstrate that major ZGA gene activation begins earlier than previously thought. Furthermore, we identify a set of genes activated during minor ZGA, the promoters of which show enrichment of the Obox factor motif, and find that Obox3 or Obox5 overexpression in mouse embryonic stem cells activates ZGA genes. Notably, the expression of Obox factors is severely impaired in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos, and restoration of Obox3 expression corrects the ZGA profile and greatly improves SCNT embryo development. Hence, our study reveals dynamic transcriptional reprogramming during ZGA and underscores the crucial role of Obox3 in facilitating totipotency acquisition.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor MYCN amplification is seen in high-risk neuroblastoma, yet direct targeting of this oncogenic transcription factor has been challenging. Here, we take advantage of the dependence of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells on increased protein synthesis to inhibit the activity of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A1 (eIF4A1) using an amidino-rocaglate, CMLD012824. Consistent with the role of this RNA helicase in resolving structural barriers in 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs), CMLD012824 increased eIF4A1 affinity for polypurine-rich 5′ UTRs, including that of the MYCN and associated transcripts with critical roles in cell proliferation. CMLD012824-mediated clamping of eIF4A1 spanned the full lengths of mRNAs, while translational inhibition was mediated through 5′ UTR binding in a cap-dependent and -independent manner. Finally, CMLD012824 led to growth inhibition in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma models without generalized toxicity. Our studies highlight the key role of eIF4A1 in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of disrupting its function.

Abstract: Summary
Embryos, originating from fertilized eggs, undergo continuous cell division and differentiation, accompanied by dramatic changes in transcription, translation, and metabolism. Chromatin regulators, including transcription factors (TFs), play indispensable roles in regulating these processes. Recently, the trophoblast regulator TFAP2C was identified as crucial in initiating early cell fate decisions. However, Tfap2c transcripts persist in both the inner cell mass and trophectoderm of blastocysts, prompting inquiry into Tfap2c’s function in post-lineage establishment. In this study, we delineate the dynamics of TFAP2C during the mouse peri-implantation stage and elucidate its collaboration with the key lineage regulators CDX2 and NANOG. Importantly, we propose that de novo formation of H3K9me3 in the extraembryonic ectoderm during implantation antagonizes TFAP2C binding to crucial developmental genes, thereby maintaining its lineage identity. Together, these results highlight the plasticity of the chromatin environment in designating the genomic binding of highly adaptable lineage-specific TFs and regulating embryonic cell fates.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome complex is an essential innate immune signaling mechanism. To reveal how human NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation are controlled, in particular by components of the ubiquitin system, proximity labeling, affinity purification, and RNAi screening approaches were performed. Our study provides an intricate time-resolved molecular map of different phases of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Also, we show that ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 1 (UCH-L1) interacts with the NACHT domain of NLRP3. Downregulation of UCH-L1 decreases pro-interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels. UCH-L1 chemical inhibition with small molecules interfered with NLRP3 puncta formation and ASC oligomerization, leading to altered IL-1β cleavage and secretion, particularly in microglia cells, which exhibited elevated UCH-L1 expression as compared to monocytes/macrophages. Altogether, we profiled NLRP3 inflammasome activation dynamics and highlight UCH-L1 as an important modulator of NLRP3-mediated IL-1β production, suggesting that a pharmacological inhibitor of UCH-L1 may decrease inflammation-associated pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
The relevance of biopterin metabolism in resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy remains unknown. We demonstrate that the deficiency of quinoid dihydropteridine reductase (QDPR), a critical enzyme regulating biopterin metabolism, causes metabolite dihydrobiopterin (BH2) accumulation and decreases the ratio of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) to BH2 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs). The reduced BH4/BH2 ratio leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and a decrease in the distribution of H3K27me3 at CXCL1 promoter. Consequently, myeloid-derived suppressor cells are recruited to tumor microenvironment via CXCR2 causing resistance to ICB therapy. We discovered that BH4 supplementation is capable to restore the BH4/BH2 ratio, enhance anti-tumor immunity, and overcome ICB resistance in QDPR-deficient PDACs. Tumors with lower QDPR expression show decreased responsiveness to ICB therapy. These findings offer a novel strategy for selecting patient and combining therapies to improve the effectiveness of ICB therapy in PDAC.

Abstract: Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) poses a serious threat to human health and is responsible for respiratory disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and skin disorders. 3-Bromo-4,5- dihydroxybenzaldehyde (3-BDB), abundant in marine red algae, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-diabetic activities. In this study, we investigated the protective mechanisms of 3-BDB against PM2.5-induced cell cycle arrest and autophagy in human keratinocytes. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, intracellular Ca2+ level, and autophagy activation were tested. 3-BDB was found to restore cell proliferation and viability which were reduced by PM2.5. Furthermore, 3-BDB reduced PM2.5-induced ROS levels, DNA damage, and attenuated cell cycle arrest. Moreover, 3-BDB ameliorated the PM2.5-induced increases in cellular Ca2+ level and autophagy activation. While PM2.5 treatment reduced cell growth and viability, these were restored by the treatment with the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 or 3-BDB. The findings indicate that 3-BDB ameliorates skin cell death caused by PM2.5 via inhibiting cell cycle arrest and autophagy. Hence, 3-BDB can be exploited as a preventive/therapeutic agent for PM2.5-induced skin impairment.

Abstract: Summary
Innovative methods to retrieve proteins associated with actively replicating DNA have provided a glimpse into the molecular dynamics of replication fork stalling. We report that a combination of density-based replisome enrichment by isolating proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND2) and label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (iPOND2-DRIPPER) substantially increases both replication factor yields and the dynamic range of protein quantification. Replication protein abundance in retrieved nascent DNA is elevated up to 300-fold over post-replicative controls, and recruitment of replication stress factors upon fork stalling is observed at similar levels. The increased sensitivity of iPOND2-DRIPPER permits direct measurement of ubiquitination events without intervening retrieval of diglycine tryptic fragments of ubiquitin. Using this approach, we find that stalled replisomes stimulate the recruitment of a diverse cohort of DNA repair factors, including those associated with poly-K63-ubiquitination. Finally, we uncover the temporally controlled association of stalled replisomes with nuclear pore complex components and nuclear cytoskeleton networks.

Abstract: Background
Allicin regulates macrophage autophagy and senescence, and inhibits hepatoma cell growth. This study investigated the mechanism by which allicin inhibits the growth of hepatoma cells.
Methods
Hepa1–6 mouse hepatoma cells were subcutaneously injected into C57BL/6 J mice to construct a tumor transplantation model. Macrophages were cultured with the supernatant of hepatoma cells to construct a cell model. The levels of mRNA and proteins and the level of Sestrin2 ubiquitination were measured by RTqPCR, immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The levels of autophagy-related factors and the activity of senescence-associated β-galactosidase were determined by kits, and protein stability was detected by cycloheximide (CHX) tracking.
Results
Data analysis of clinical samples revealed that RBX1 was highly expressed in tumor tissues, while Sestrin2 was expressed at low levels in tumor tissues. Allicin can promote the expression of the autophagy-related proteins LC3 and Beclin-1 in tumor macrophages and inhibit the expression of the aging-related proteins p16 and p21, thus promoting autophagy in macrophages and inhibiting cell senescence. Moreover, allicin can inhibit the expression of RBX1, thereby reducing the ubiquitination of Sestrin2, enhancing the stability of Sestrin2, activating autophagy in tumor macrophages and inhibiting senescence. In addition, allicin treatment inhibited the proliferation and migration of hepatoma carcinoma cells cocultured with macrophages and significantly improved the development of liver cancer in mice.
Conclusion
Allicin can affect the autophagy of macrophages and restrain the growth of hepatoma cells by regulating the ubiquitination of Sestrin2.

Abstract: Summary
DNA polymerase θ (Polθ) plays a central role in a DNA double-strand break repair pathway termed theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). TMEJ functions by pairing short-sequence “microhomologies” (MHs) in single-stranded DNA at each end of a break and subsequently initiating DNA synthesis. It is not known how the Polθ helicase domain (HD) and polymerase domain (PD) operate to bring together MHs and facilitate repair. To resolve these transient processes in real time, we utilized in vitro single-molecule FRET approaches and biochemical analyses. We find that the Polθ-HD mediates the initial capture of two ssDNA strands, bringing them in close proximity. The Polθ-PD binds and stabilizes pre-annealed MHs to form a synaptic complex (SC) and initiate repair synthesis. Individual synthesis reactions show that Polθ is inherently non-processive, accounting for complex mutational patterns during TMEJ. Binding of Polθ-PD to stem-loop-forming sequences can substantially limit synapsis, depending on the available dNTPs and sequence context.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and the development of liver fibrosis are not fully understood. Here, we show that deletion of a nuclear seven transmembrane protein, TM7SF3, accelerates HSC activation in liver organoids, primary human HSCs, and in vivo in metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) mice, leading to activation of the fibrogenic program and HSC proliferation. Thus, TM7SF3 knockdown promotes alternative splicing of the Hippo pathway transcription factor, TEAD1, by inhibiting the splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNPU). This results in the exclusion of the inhibitory exon 5, generating a more active form of TEAD1 and triggering HSC activation. Furthermore, inhibiting TEAD1 alternative splicing with a specific antisense oligomer (ASO) deactivates HSCs in vitro and reduces MASH diet-induced liver fibrosis. In conclusion, by inhibiting TEAD1 alternative splicing, TM7SF3 plays a pivotal role in mitigating HSC activation and the progression of MASH-related fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
The role and molecular mechanisms of intermittent fasting (IF) in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and its transition to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unknown. Here, we identified that an IF 5:2 regimen prevents NASH development as well as ameliorates established NASH and fibrosis without affecting total calorie intake. Furthermore, the IF 5:2 regimen blunted NASH-HCC transition when applied therapeutically. The timing, length, and number of fasting cycles as well as the type of NASH diet were critical parameters determining the benefits of fasting. Combined proteome, transcriptome, and metabolome analyses identified that peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and glucocorticoid-signaling-induced PCK1 act co-operatively as hepatic executors of the fasting response. In line with this, PPARα targets and PCK1 were reduced in human NASH. Notably, only fasting initiated during the active phase of mice robustly induced glucocorticoid signaling and free-fatty-acid-induced PPARα signaling. However, hepatocyte-specific glucocorticoid receptor deletion only partially abrogated the hepatic fasting response. In contrast, the combined knockdown of Ppara and Pck1 in vivo abolished the beneficial outcomes of fasting against inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, overexpression of Pck1 alone or together with Ppara in vivo lowered hepatic triglycerides and steatosis. Our data support the notion that the IF 5:2 regimen is a promising intervention against NASH and subsequent liver cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine crotonylation has attracted widespread attention in recent years. However, little is known about bacterial crotonylation, particularly crotonyltransferase and decrotonylase, and its effects on antibiotic resistance. Our study demonstrates the ubiquitous presence of crotonylation in E. coli, which promotes bacterial resistance to polymyxin. We identify the crotonyltransferase YjgM and its regulatory pathways in E. coli with a focus on crotonylation. Further studies show that YjgM upregulates the crotonylation of the substrate protein PmrA, thereby boosting PmrA’s affinity for binding to the promoter of eptA, which, in turn, promotes EptA expression and confers polymyxin resistance in E. coli. Additionally, we discover that PmrA’s crucial crotonylation site and functional site is Lys 164. These significant discoveries highlight the role of crotonylation in bacterial drug resistance and offer a fresh perspective on creating antibacterial compounds.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of muscle mass is a feature of chronic illness and aging. Here, we report that skeletal muscle-specific thrombospondin-1 transgenic mice (Thbs1 Tg) have profound muscle atrophy with age-dependent decreases in exercise capacity and premature lethality. Mechanistically, Thbs1 activates transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-Smad2/3 signaling, which also induces activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) expression that together modulates the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to facilitate muscle atrophy. Indeed, myofiber-specific inhibition of TGFβ-receptor signaling represses the induction of ATF4, normalizes ALP and UPS, and partially restores muscle mass in Thbs1 Tg mice. Similarly, myofiber-specific deletion of Smad2 and Smad3 or the Atf4 gene antagonizes Thbs1-induced muscle atrophy. More importantly, Thbs1−/− mice show significantly reduced levels of denervation- and caloric restriction-mediated muscle atrophy, along with blunted TGFβ-Smad3-ATF4 signaling. Thus, Thbs1-mediated TGFβ-Smad3-ATF4 signaling in skeletal muscle regulates tissue rarefaction, suggesting a target for atrophy-based muscle diseases and sarcopenia with aging.

Abstract: Summary
For an organ to maintain correct architecture and function, its diverse cellular components must coordinate their size and shape. Although cell-intrinsic mechanisms driving homotypic cell-cell coordination are known, it is unclear how cell shape is regulated across heterotypic cells. We find that epithelial cells maintain the shape of neighboring sense-organ glia-neuron units in adult Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Hsp co-chaperone UNC-23/BAG2 prevents epithelial cell shape from deforming, and its loss causes head epithelia to stretch aberrantly during animal movement. In the sense-organ glia, amphid sheath (AMsh), this causes progressive fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-dependent disruption of the glial apical cytoskeleton. Resultant glial cell shape alteration causes concomitant shape change in glia-associated neuron endings. Epithelial UNC-23 maintenance of glia-neuron shape is specific both spatially, within a defined anatomical zone, and temporally, in a developmentally critical period. As all molecular components uncovered are broadly conserved across central and peripheral nervous systems, we posit that epithelia may similarly regulate glia-neuron architecture cross-species.

Abstract: Summary
In bony fishes, patterning of the vertebral column, or spine, is guided by a metameric blueprint established in the notochord sheath. Notochord segmentation begins days after somitogenesis concludes and can occur in its absence. However, somite patterning defects lead to imprecise notochord segmentation, suggesting that these processes are linked. Here, we identify that interactions between the notochord and the axial musculature ensure precise spatiotemporal segmentation of the zebrafish spine. We demonstrate that myoseptum-notochord linkages drive notochord segment initiation by locally deforming the notochord extracellular matrix and recruiting focal adhesion machinery at these contact points. Irregular somite patterning alters this mechanical signaling, causing non-sequential and dysmorphic notochord segmentation, leading to altered spine development. Using a model that captures myoseptum-notochord interactions, we find that a fixed spatial interval is critical for driving sequential segment initiation. Thus, mechanical coupling of axial tissues facilitates spatiotemporal spine patterning.

Abstract: While understanding the genetic underpinnings of osteogenesis has far-reaching implications for skeletal diseases and evolution, a comprehensive characterization of the osteoblastic regulatory landscape in non-mammalian vertebrates is still lacking. Here, we compared the ATAC-Seq profile of Xenopus tropicalis (Xt) osteoblasts to a variety of non mineralizing control tissues, and identified osteoblast-specific nucleosome free regions (NFRs) at 527 promoters and 6747 distal regions. Sequence analyses, Gene Ontology, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq against four key histone marks confirmed that the distal regions correspond to bona fide osteogenic transcriptional enhancers exhibiting a shared regulatory logic with mammals. We report 425 regulatory regions conserved with human and globally associated to skeletogenic genes. Of these, 35 regions have been shown to impact human skeletal phenotypes by GWAS, including one trps1 enhancer and the runx2 promoter, two genes which are respectively involved in trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type I and cleidocranial dysplasia. Intriguingly, 60 osteoblastic NFRs also align to the genome of the elephant shark, a species lacking osteoblasts and bone tissue. To tackle this paradox, we chose to focus on dlx5 because its conserved promoter, known to integrate regulatory inputs during mammalian osteogenesis, harbours an osteoblast-specific NFR in both frog and human. Hence, we show that dlx5 is expressed in Xt and elephant shark odontoblasts, supporting a common cellular and genetic origin of bone and dentine. Taken together, our work (i) unravels the Xt osteogenic regulatory landscape, (ii) illustrates how cross-species comparisons harvest data relevant to human biology and (iii) reveals that a set of genes including bnc2, dlx5, ebf3, mir199a, nfia, runx2 and zfhx4 drove the development of a primitive form of mineralized skeletal tissue deep in the vertebrate lineage.

Abstract: Summary
Zebrafish have a lifelong cardiac regenerative ability after damage, whereas mammals lose this capacity during early postnatal development. This study investigated whether the declining expression of growth factors during postnatal mammalian development contributes to the decrease of cardiomyocyte regenerative potential. Besides confirming the proliferative ability of neuregulin 1 (NRG1), interleukin (IL)1b, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL), insulin growth factor (IGF)2, and IL6, we identified other potential pro-regenerative factors, with BMP7 exhibiting the most pronounced efficacy. Bmp7 knockdown in neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes and loss-of-function in adult zebrafish during cardiac regeneration reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation, indicating that Bmp7 is crucial in the regenerative stages of mouse and zebrafish hearts. Conversely, bmp7 overexpression in regenerating zebrafish or administration at post-mitotic juvenile and adult mouse stages, in vitro and in vivo following myocardial infarction, enhanced cardiomyocyte cycling. Mechanistically, BMP7 stimulated proliferation through BMPR1A/ACVR1 and ACVR2A/BMPR2 receptors and downstream SMAD5, ERK, and AKT signaling. Overall, BMP7 administration is a promising strategy for heart regeneration.

Abstract: The soft epidermis of mammals derives from the accumulation of keratohyaline granules in the granular layer, before maturing into corneocytes. Main proteins accumulated in the granular layer are pro-filaggrin and filaggrin that determine keratin clumping and later moisturization of the stratum corneum that remains flexible. This soft epidermis allows the high sensitivity of mammalian skin. Presence and thickness of the stratum granulosum varies among different species of mammals and even between different body regions of the same animal, from discontinuous to multilayered. These variations are evident using antibodies for filaggrin, a large protein that share common epitopes among placentals. Here we have utilized filaggrin antibodies (8959 and 466) and an acidic keratin antibody (AK2) for labeling placental, marsupial and monotreme epidermis. AK2 labeling appears mainly to detect K24 keratin, and less likely other acidic keratins. Immunoreactivity for filaggrin is absent in platypus, discontinuous in Echidna and in the tested marsupials. In placentals, it is inconstantly or hardly detected in the thin epidermis of bat, rodents, and lagomorphs with a narrow, mono-stratified and/or discontinuous granular layer. In contrast, where the granular layer is continuous or even stratified, both filaggrin and AK2 antibodies decorate granular cells. The ultrastructural analysis using the AK2 antibody on human epidermis reveals that a weak labeling is associated with keratohyalin granules and filamentous keratins of transitional keratinocytes and corneocytes. This observation suggests that basophilic filaggrin interacts with acidic keratins like K24 and determines keratin condensation into corneocytes of the stratum corneum.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) recapitulate numerous disease and drug response phenotypes, but cell immaturity may limit their accuracy and fidelity as a model system. Cell culture medium modification is a common method for enhancing maturation, yet prior studies have used complex media with little understanding of individual component contribution, which may compromise long-term hiPSC-CM viability. Here, we developed high-throughput methods to measure hiPSC-CM maturation, determined factors that enhanced viability, and then systematically assessed the contribution of individual maturation medium components. We developed a medium that is compatible with extended culture. We discovered that hiPSC-CM maturation can be sub-specified into electrophysiological/EC coupling, metabolism, and gene expression and that induction of these attributes is largely independent. In this work, we establish a defined baseline for future studies of cardiomyocyte maturation. Furthermore, we provide a selection of medium formulae, optimized for distinct applications and priorities, that promote measurable attributes of maturation.

Abstract: Summary
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), strategically positioned throughout the body, undergo population declines over time. A solution to counteract this problem is timely mobilization of multipotential progenitors from the bone marrow. It remains unknown what triggers the mobilization of bone marrow ILC progenitors (ILCPs). We report that ILCPs are regulated by the circadian clock to emigrate and generate mature ILCs in the periphery. We found that circadian-clock-defective ILCPs fail to normally emigrate and generate ILCs. We identified circadian-clock-controlled endocrine and cytokine cues that, respectively, regulate the retention and emigration of ILCPs at distinct times of each day. Activation of the stress-hormone-sensing glucocorticoid receptor upregulates CXCR4 on ILCPs for their retention in the bone marrow, while the interleukin-18 (IL-18) and RORα signals upregulate S1PR1 on ILCPs for their mobilization to the periphery. Our findings establish important roles of circadian signals for the homeostatic efflux of bone marrow (BM) ILCPs.

Abstract: Summary
Astrocytes play vital roles in blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintenance, yet how they support BBB integrity under normal or pathological conditions remains poorly defined. Recent evidence suggests that ion homeostasis is a cellular mechanism important for BBB integrity. In the current study, we investigated the function of an astrocyte-specific pH regulator, Slc4a4, in BBB maintenance and repair. We show that astrocytic Slc4a4 is required for normal astrocyte morphological complexity and BBB function. Multi-omics analyses identified increased astrocytic secretion of CCL2 coupled with dysregulated arginine-NO metabolism after Slc4a4 deletion. Using a model of ischemic stroke, we found that loss of Slc4a4 exacerbates BBB disruption, which was rescued by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the CCL2-CCR2 pathway in vivo. Together, our study identifies the astrocytic Slc4a4-CCL2 and endothelial CCR2 axis as a mechanism controlling BBB integrity and repair, while providing insights for a therapeutic approach against BBB-related CNS disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Recent findings show that effective integration of novel information in the brain requires coordinated processes of homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity. In this work, we hypothesize that activity-dependent remodeling of the peri-synaptic extracellular matrix (ECM) contributes to these processes. We show that clusters of the peri-synaptic ECM, recognized by CS56 antibody, emerge in response to sensory stimuli, showing temporal and spatial coincidence with dendritic spine plasticity. Using CS56 co-immunoprecipitation of synaptosomal proteins, we identify several molecules involved in Ca2+ signaling, vesicle cycling, and AMPA-receptor exocytosis, thus suggesting a role in long-term potentiation (LTP). Finally, we show that, in the CA1 hippocampal region, the attenuation of CS56 glycoepitopes, through the depletion of versican as one of its main carriers, impairs LTP and object location memory in mice. These findings show that activity-dependent remodeling of the peri-synaptic ECM regulates the induction and consolidation of LTP, contributing to hippocampal-dependent memory.

The traditional view of hematopoiesis is that myeloid cells derive from a common myeloid progenitor (CMP), whereas all lymphoid cell populations, including B, T, and natural killer (NK) cells and possibly plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), arise from a common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). In Max41 transgenic mice, nearly all B cells seem to be diverted into the granulocyte lineage. Here, we show that these mice have an excess of myeloid progenitors, but their CLP compartment is ablated, and they have few pDCs. Nevertheless, T cell and NK cell development proceeds relatively normally. These hematopoietic abnormalities result from aberrant expression of Gata6 due to serendipitous insertion of the transgene enhancer (Eμ) in its proximity. Gata6 mis-expression in Max41 transgenic progenitors promoted the gene-regulatory networks that drive myelopoiesis through increasing expression of key transcription factors, including PU.1 and C/EBPa. Thus, mis-expression of a single key regulator like GATA6 can dramatically re-program multiple aspects of hematopoiesis.
