Abstract: The ChlR1 DNA helicase, encoded by DDX11 gene, which is responsible for Warsaw breakage syndrome (WABS), has a role in sister-chromatid cohesion. In this study, we show that human ChlR1 deficient cells exhibit abnormal heterochromatin organization. While constitutive heterochromatin is discretely localized at perinuclear and perinucleolar regions in control HeLa cells, ChlR1-depleted cells showed dispersed localization of constitutive heterochromatin accompanied by disrupted centromere clustering. Cells isolated from Ddx11−/− embryos also exhibited diffuse localization of centromeres and heterochromatin foci. Similar abnormalities were found in HeLa cells depleted of combinations of HP1α and HP1β. Immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed a decreased level of HP1α at pericentric regions in ChlR1-depleted cells. Trimethyl-histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9-me3) was also modestly decreased at pericentric sequences. The abnormality in pericentric heterochromatin was further supported by decreased DNA methylation within major satellite repeats of Ddx11−/− embryos. Furthermore, micrococcal nuclease (MNase) assay revealed a decreased chromatin density at the telomeres. These data suggest that in addition to a role in sister-chromatid cohesion, ChlR1 is also involved in the proper formation of heterochromatin, which in turn contributes to global nuclear organization and pleiotropic effects.

Abstract: Oxidative stress causes damage at the cellular level and activates a number of signaling pathways. Earlier, we have demonstrated that pollutant-related oxidative stress upregulates heat-shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90α) against stress insult in hepatocytes of Mugil cephalus living in a polluted estuary. However, the impact of pollution-induced HSP90α upregulation on stress tolerance is not clear. Here we propose that the effect of stress resistance depends on the ability of HSP90α to modulate the signaling pathways involving proteins such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase 1/2, signal transducers and activators of transcription, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, protein kinase B, nuclear factor-kappa binding, Ets-like protein 1, and B cell lymphoma-2. In order to investigate this, the activation of HSP90α-associated signaling molecules was examined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The relationship between the protein expression patterns was identified by Spearman’s rank correlation analysis. The signaling proteins exhibited differential modulation as revealed from their expression patterns in pollutant-exposed fish hepatocytes, in comparison with the control fish hepatocytes. The results suggested that in spite of the prevalence of oxidative stress in pollutant-exposed fish hepatocytes, the stress-mediated induction of HSP90α enabled the hepatocytes to become stress tolerant and to survive by modulating the actions of key proteins and kinases in the signal transduction pathways.

Abstract: Tight junctions are the most apical component of the junctional complex critical for epithelial cell barrier and polarity functions. Although its disruption is well documented during cancer progression such as epithelial–mesenchymal transition, molecular mechanisms by which tight junction integral membrane protein claudins affect this process remain largely unknown. In this report, we found that claudin-7 was normally expressed in bronchial epithelial cells of human lungs but was either downregulated or disrupted in its distribution pattern in lung cancer. To investigate the function of claudin-7 in lung cancer cells, we transfected claudin-7 cDNA into NCI-H1299, a human lung carcinoma cell line that has no detectable claudin-7 expression. We found that claudin-7 expressing cells showed a reduced response to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) treatment, were less motile, and formed fewer foot processes than the control cells did. In addition, cells transfected with claudin-7 dramatically decreased their invasive ability after HGF treatment. These effects were mediated through the MAPK signaling pathway since the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 was significantly lower in claudin-7 transfected cells than in control cells. PD98059, a selective inhibitor of ERK/MAPK pathway, was able to block the motile effect. Claudin-7 formed stable complexes with claudin-1 and -3 and was able to recruit them to the cell-cell junction area in claudin-7 transfected cells. When control and claudin-7 transfected cells were inoculated into nude mice, claudin-7 expressing cells produced smaller tumors than the control cells. Taken together, our study demonstrates that claudin-7 inhibits cell migration and invasion through ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in response to growth factor stimulation in human lung cancer cells.

Abstract: The compartmental nature of eukaryotic cells requires sophisticated mechanisms of protein sorting. Prosaposin, the precursor of four sphingolipid activator proteins, is transported from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to lysosomes as a partially glycosylated (65kDa) protein with high-mannose/hybrid oligosaccharides. Prosaposin is also found in the extracellular space where it is secreted as a fully glycosylated (70kDa) protein composed of complex glycans. Although the trafficking of prosaposin to lysosomes is known to be mediated by sortilin, the mechanism of secretion of this protein is still unknown. In this study, we report that prosaposin may covalently aggregate into oligomers. Our results demonstrate that while prosaposin oligomers are secreted into the extracellular space, monomeric prosaposin remains inside the cell bound to sortilin. We also found that deletion of the C-terminus of prosaposin, previously shown to block its lysosomal transport, did not abolish its oligomerization and secretion. On the other hand, elimination of the N-terminus and of each saposin domain inhibited its oligomerization and resulted in its retention as a fully glycosylated protein. In conclusion, we are reporting for the first time that oligomerization of prosaposin is crucial for its entry into the secretory pathway.

Abstract: The directed migration of cells towards chemical stimuli incorporates simultaneous changes in both the concentration of a chemotactic agent and its concentration gradient, each of which may influence cell migratory response. In this study, we utilized a microfluidic system to examine the interactions between epidermal growth factor (EGF) concentration and EGF gradient in stimulating the chemotaxis of connective tissue-derived fibroblast cells. Cells seeded within microfluidic devices were exposed to concentration gradients established by EGF concentrations that matched or exceeded those required for maximum chemotactic responses seen in transfilter migration assays. The migration of individual cells within the device was measured optically after steady-state gradients had been experimentally established. Results illustrate that motility was maximal at EGF concentration gradients between .01- and 0.1-ng/(mL.mm) for all concentrations used. In contrast, the number of motile cells continually increased with increasing gradient steepness for all concentrations examined. Microfluidics-based experiments exposed cells to minute changes in EGF concentration and gradient that were in line with the acute EGFR phosphorylation measured. Correlation of experimental data with established mathematical models illustrated that the fibroblasts studied exhibit an unreported chemosensitivity to minute changes in EGF concentration, similar to that reported for highly motile cells, such as macrophages. Our results demonstrate that shallow chemotactic gradients, while previously unexplored, are necessary to induce the rate of directed cellular migration and the number of motile cells in the connective tissue-derived cells examined.

Abstract: Summary
Segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are noncultivable commensals inhabiting the gut of various vertebrate species and have been shown to induce Th17 cells in mice. We present the complete genome sequences of both rat and mouse SFB isolated from SFB-monocolonized hosts. The rat and mouse SFB genomes each harbor a single circular chromosome of 1.52 and 1.59 Mb encoding 1346 and 1420 protein-coding genes, respectively. The overall nucleotide identity between the two genomes is 86%, and the substitution rate was estimated to be similar to that of the free-living E. coli. SFB genomes encode typical genes for anaerobic fermentation and spore and flagella formation, but lack most of the amino acid biosynthesis enzymes, reminiscent of pathogenic Clostridia, exhibiting large dependency on the host. However, SFB lack most of the clostridial virulence-related genes. Comparative analysis with clostridial genomes suggested possible mechanisms for host responses and specific adaptations in the intestine.

Abstract: The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii is exposed to a variety of physiological conditions while propagating in an infected organism. The mechanisms by which Toxoplasma overcomes these dramatic changes in its environment are not known. In yeast and plants, ion detoxification and osmotic regulation are controlled by vacuolar compartments. A novel compartment named the plant-like vacuole or vacuolar compartment (PLV/VAC) has recently been described in T.gondii, which could potentially protect extracellular tachyzoites against salt and other ionic stresses. Here, we report the molecular characterization of the vacuolar type Na+/H+ exchanger in T. gondii, TgNHE3, and its co-localization with the PLV/VAC proton-pyrophosphatase (TgVP1). We have created a TgNHE3 knockout strain, which is more sensitive to hyperosmotic shock and toxic levels of sodium, possesses a higher intracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]i, and exhibits a reduced host invasion efficiency. The defect in invasion correlates with a measurable reduction in the secretion of the adhesin TgMIC2. Overall, our results suggest that the PLV/VAC has functions analogous to those of the vacuolar compartments of plants and yeasts, providing the parasite with a mechanism to resist ionic fluctuations and, potentially, regulate protein trafficking.

Abstract: In the human thymus, AIRE (autoimmune regulator) gene is expressed in a very limited type of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and no cognate cell lines are available, hence the molecular analysis of AIRE gene function has been difficult. To improve this situation, we attempted to isolate Aire-expressing cells and established three cell lines (Aire+TEC1, Aire+TEC2, Aire+DC) from the abnormally enlarged thymus, which was developed in the transgenic mice expressing SV40 T-antigen driven by the mouse Aire gene promoter. When these Aire+ cell lines were co-cultured with fresh thymocytes, they adhered to the majority of thymocytes and induced apoptosis as if negative selection of T-cells in the thymus is occurring in vitro. Further analysis revealed that these Aire+ cell lines are derived from mTECs and exhibit characteristic natures of “antigen presenting cells” including several distinct abilities: to express a variety of peripheral tissue-specific antigens, to produce immunoproteasome and immunological synapse, and to express some of TNFSFs (tumor necrosis factor super families). Thus, the newly established Aire+ cell lines will be invaluable for the further detailed analysis of AIRE gene function in the central tolerance of immunity and autoimmune disease.

Abstract: Cytokinesis in mammalian cells requires actin assembly at the equatorial region. Although functions of RhoA in this process have been well established, additional mechanisms are likely involved. We have examined if Cdc42 is involved in actin assembly during cytokinesis. Depletion of Cdc42 had no apparent effects on the duration of cytokinesis, while overexpression of constitutively active Cdc42 (CACdc42) caused cytokinesis failure in normal rat kidney epithelial cells. Cells depleted of Cdc42 displayed abnormal cell morphology and caused a failure of tight accumulation of actin and RhoA at the equator. In contrast, in cells overexpressing CACdc42, actin formed abnormal bundles and RhoA was largely eliminated from the equator. Our results suggest that accurate regulation of Cdc42 activity is crucial for proper equatorial actin assembly and RhoA localization during cytokinesis. Notably, our observations also suggest that tight actin concentration is not essential for cytokinesis in adherent mammalian cells.

Abstract: To better understand the physiological capability of cold-stenothermal organisms to survive high-temperature stress, we analyzed the thermotolerance limits and the expression level of hsp70 genes under temperature stress in the alpine midge Pseudodiamesa branickii (Diptera Chironomidae). A lethal temperature (LT100) of 36°C and a lethal temperature 50% (LT50) of 32.2°C were found for the cold-stenothermal larvae after short-term shocks (1 h). Additional experiments revealed that the duration of the exposure negatively influenced survival, whereas a prior exposure to a less severe high temperature generated an increase in survival. To investigate the molecular basis of this high thermotolerance, the expression of the hsp70 gene family was surveyed via semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis in treated larvae. The constitutive (hsc70) and inducible (hsp70) forms were both analyzed. Larvae of P. branickii showed a significant up-regulation of inducible hsp70 gene with increasing temperatures and an over-expression of both hsp70 and hsc70 by increasing the time of exposure. Different from that was shown in many cold-stenothermal Antarctic organisms, P. branickii was able to activate hsp70 genes transcription (equal to heat shock response) in response to thermal stress. Finally, the unclear relationship between hsp70 expression and survival led us to surmise that genes other than hsp70 and other processes apart from the biochemical processes might generate the high thermaltolerance of P. branickii larvae. These results and future high-throughput studies at both the transcriptome and proteome level will improve our ability to predict the future geographic distribution of this species within the context of global warming.

Abstract: Summary
In response to virus infection, type I interferons (IFNs) induce several genes, most of whose functions are largely unknown. Here, we show that the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein, TRIM79α, is an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) product that specifically targets tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a Flavivirus that causes encephalitides in humans. TRIM79α restricts TBEV replication by mediating lysosome-dependent degradation of the flavivirus NS5 protein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase essential for virus replication. NS5 degradation was specific to tick-borne flaviviruses, as TRIM79α did not recognize NS5 from West Nile virus (WNV) or inhibit WNV replication. In the absence of TRIM79α, IFN-β was less effective in inhibiting tick-borne flavivirus infection of mouse macrophages, highlighting the importance of a single virus-specific ISG in establishing an antiviral state. The specificity of TRIM79α for TBEV reveals a remarkable ability of the innate IFN response to discriminate between closely related flaviviruses.

Abstract: Hes6 is a member of the hairy-enhancer-of-split family of transcription factors that regulate proliferating cell fate in development and is known to be expressed in developing muscle. Here we investigate its function in myogenesis in vitro. We show that Hes6 is a direct transcriptional target of the myogenic transcription factors MyoD and Myf5, indicating that it is integral to the myogenic transcriptional program. The localization of Hes6 protein changes during differentiation, becoming predominantly nuclear. Knockdown of Hes6 mRNA levels by siRNA has no effect on cell cycle exit or induction of myosin heavy chain expression in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts, but F-actin filament formation is disrupted and both cell motility and myoblast fusion are reduced. The knockdown phenotype is rescued by expression of Hes6 cDNA resistant to siRNA. These results define a novel role for Hes6 in actin cytoskeletal dynamics in post mitotic myoblasts.

Abstract: Mitochondrial DNA depleted (ρ0) human skin fibroblasts (HSF) with suppressed oxidative phosphorylation were characterized by significant changes in the expression of 2100 nuclear genes, encoding numerous protein classes, in NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways, and by decreased activity of mitochondrial death pathway, compared to the parental ρ+ HSF. In contrast, the extrinsic TRAIL/TRAIL-Receptor mediated death pathway remained highly active, and exogenous TRAIL in a combination with cycloheximide (CHX) induced higher levels of apoptosis in ρ0 cells compared to ρ+ HSF. Global gene expression analysis using microarray and qRT-PCR demonstrated that mRNA expression levels of many growth factors and their adaptor proteins (FGF13, HGF, IGFBP4, IGFBP6, and IGFL2), cytokines (IL6, ΙL17Β, ΙL18, ΙL19, and ΙL28Β) and cytokine receptors (IL1R1, IL21R, and IL31RA) were substantially decreased after mitochondrial DNA depletion. Some of these genes were targets of NF-κB and STAT3, and their protein products could regulate the STAT3 signaling pathway. Alpha-irradiation further induced expression of several NF-κB/STAT3 target genes, including IL1A, IL1B, IL6, PTGS2/COX2 and MMP12, in ρ+ HSF, but this response was substantially decreased in ρ0 HSF. Suppression of the IKK–NF-κB pathway by the small molecular inhibitor BMS-345541 and of the JAK2–STAT3 pathway by AG490 dramatically increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the control and irradiated ρ+ HSF. Inhibitory antibodies against IL6, the main activator of JAK2–STAT3 pathway, added into the cell media, also increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HSF, especially after alpha-irradiation. Collectively, our results indicated that NF-κB activation was partially lost in ρ0 HSF resulting in downregulation of the basal or radiation-induced expression of numerous NF-κB targets, further suppressing IL6–JAK2–STAT3 that in concert with NF-κB regulated protection against TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain occurs in animal and plant immune receptors. In the animal Toll-like receptors, homodimerization of the intracellular TIR domain is required for initiation of signaling cascades leading to innate immunity. By contrast, the role of the TIR domain in cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) plant immune resistance proteins is poorly understood. L6 is a TIR-NB-LRR resistance protein from flax (Linum usitatissimum) that confers resistance to the flax rust phytopathogenic fungus (Melampsora lini). We determine the crystal structure of the L6 TIR domain and show that, although dispensable for pathogenic effector protein recognition, the TIR domain alone is both necessary and sufficient for L6 immune signaling. We demonstrate that the L6 TIR domain self-associates, most likely forming a homodimer. Analysis of the structure combined with site-directed mutagenesis suggests that self-association is a requirement for immune signaling and reveals distinct surface regions involved in self-association, signaling, and autoregulation.

Abstract: In contrast to normal prostatic cells, the transcriptional repressor Inducible cAMP Early Repressor (ICER) is undetected in the nuclei of prostate cancer cells. The molecular mechanisms for ICER abnormal expression in prostate cancer cells remained largely unknown. In this report data is presented demonstrating that ICER is phosphorylated by the mitotic kinase cdk1. Phosphorylation of ICER on a discrete residue targeted ICER to be monoubiquitinated. Different from unphosphorylated, phosphorylated and polyubiquitinated ICER, monoubiquitinated ICER was found to be cytosolic. Taken together, these results hinted on a mechanism for the observed abnormal subcellular localization of ICER in human prostate tumors.

Abstract: We have previously shown that mitochondrial protein synthesis regulates myoblast differentiation, partly through the control of c-Myc expression, a cellular oncogene regulating myogenin expression and myoblast withdrawal from the cell cycle. In this study we provide evidence of the involvement of Calcineurin in this regulation. In C2C12 myoblasts, inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis by chloramphenicol decreases Calcineurin expression. Conversely, stimulation of this process by overexpressing the T3 mitochondrial receptor (p43) increases Calcineurin expression. Moreover, expression of a constitutively active Calcineurin (ΔCN) stimulates myoblast differentiation, whereas a Calcineurin antisense has the opposite effect. Lastly, ΔCN expression or stimulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis specifically increases slow myosin heavy chain expression. In conclusion, these data clearly suggest that, partly via Calcineurin expression, mitochondrial protein synthesis is involved in muscle development through the control of myoblast differentiation and probably the acquisition of the contractile and metabolic phenotype of muscle fibres.

Abstract: Angiogenesis is regulated by both soluble growth factors and cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). While cell adhesion via integrins has been shown to be required for angiogenesis, the effects of quantitative changes in cell adhesion and spreading against the ECM remain less clear. Here, we show that angiogenic sprouting in natural and engineered three-dimensional matrices exhibited a biphasic response, with peak sprouting when adhesion to the matrix was limited to intermediate levels. Examining changes in global gene expression to determine a genetic basis for this response, we demonstrate a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced upregulation of genes associated with vascular invasion and remodeling when cell adhesion was limited, whereas cells on highly adhesive surfaces upregulated genes associated with proliferation. To explore a mechanistic basis for this effect, we turned to focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a central player in adhesion signaling previously implicated in angiogenesis, and its homologue, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2). While FAK signaling had some impact, our results suggested that Pyk2 can regulate both gene expression and endothelial sprouting through its enhanced activation by VEGF in limited adhesion contexts. We also demonstrate decreased sprouting of tissue explants from Pyk2-null mice as compared to wild type mice as further confirmation of the role of Pyk2 in angiogenic sprouting. These results suggest a surprising finding that limited cell adhesion can enhance endothelial responsiveness to VEGF and demonstrate a novel role for Pyk2 in the adhesive regulation of angiogenesis.

Abstract: Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and mutations in the HSPD1 gene, encoding the mitochondrial Hsp60 chaperone, are the causative factors of two neurodegenerative diseases, hereditary spastic paraplegia and MitChap60 disease. In cooperation with Hsp10, Hsp60 forms a barrel-shaped complex, which encloses unfolded polypeptides and provides an environment facilitating folding. We have generated an Hsp60 variant with a mutation (Asp423Ala) in the ATPase domain and established a stable human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell line allowing tetracycline-controlled expression of this mutant variant. We monitored expression of the Hsp60–Asp423Ala variant protein following induction and examined its effects on cellular properties. We showed that the folding of mitochondrial-targeted green fluorescent protein, a well-known substrate protein of Hsp60, was consistently impaired in cells expressing Hsp60–Asp423Ala. The level of the Hsp60–Asp423Ala variant protein increased over time upon induction, cell proliferation stopped after 48-h induction and mitochondrial membrane potential decreased in a time-dependent manner. In summary, we have established a stable cell line with controllable expression of an Hsp60 variant, which allows detailed studies of different degrees of Hsp60 deficiency.

Abstract: The translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) displays growth-promoting and antiapoptotic properties. To gain information on the role of TCTP in cancer disease, we studied the modulation of TCTP and cell survival under stress conditions on tumor cell lines of different origins. When cancer cells were exposed to a mild oxidative stress, such low doses of Arsenic trioxide (ATO) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), up-regulation of TCTP was observed in cells survived to the treatment. Differently, a strong oxidative hit provided by ATO combined with glutathione (GSH) depletion or condition of glucose deprivation caused a down-modulation of TCTP followed by cell death. Clones with a forced expression of TCTP or with silenced TCTP were obtained from the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. The sensitivity to oxidative stress was strongly enhanced in down-modulated TCTP cells while decreasing in cells with high levels of TCTP. Together these results indicate that TCTP is a survival factor that protects cancer cells from oxidative stress-induced cell-death. We propose TCTP as a “stress hallmark” that may be exploited as a therapeutic target to decrease the resistance of cancer cells to anticancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis thrives within macrophages by residing in phagosomes and preventing them from maturing and fusing with lysosomes. A parallel transcriptional survey of intracellular mycobacteria and their host macrophages revealed signatures of heavy metal poisoning. In particular, mycobacterial genes encoding heavy metal efflux P-type ATPases CtpC, CtpG, and CtpV, and host cell metallothioneins and zinc exporter ZnT1, were induced during infection. Consistent with this pattern of gene modulation, we observed a burst of free zinc inside macrophages, and intraphagosomal zinc accumulation within a few hours postinfection. Zinc exposure led to rapid CtpC induction, and ctpC deficiency caused zinc retention within the mycobacterial cytoplasm, leading to impaired intracellular growth of the bacilli. Thus, the use of P1-type ATPases represents a M. tuberculosis strategy to neutralize the toxic effects of zinc in macrophages. We propose that heavy metal toxicity and its counteraction might represent yet another chapter in the host-microbe arms race.

Abstract: The role of individual protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms in the regulation of p53-mediated apoptosis is still uncertain. Using yeast cells co-expressing the human wild-type p53 and a single mammalian PKCα, δ, ε or ζ, we showed a differential regulation of p53-mediated apoptosis by these PKC isoforms. Whereas PKCα and ζ had no effect on p53 activity, PKCδ and ε stimulated a p53-mediated mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, using pifithrin-α and -μ, selective inhibitors of p53 transcriptional activity and mitochondrial p53 translocation, respectively, we showed the activation of a transcription-dependent and -independent p53-mediated apoptosis by PKCδ and ε. The activation of mitochondrial p53 translocation by PKCδ and ε was further confirmed by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Together, this work reveals the conservation in yeast of functional transcription-dependent and -independent p53 apoptotic mechanisms. Furthermore, it gives mechanistic insights about the regulation of p53-mediated apoptosis by PKCδ and ε through modulation of p53 transcriptional activity and of its translocation to mitochondria. Finally, it underscores a major role of PKCδ and ε as positive regulators of p53-mediated apoptosis, and therefore as promising therapeutic targets in cancer.

Abstract: Adipose tissue contains various cells such as infiltrated monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells, preadipocytes, and adipocytes. Adipocytes have an endocrine function by secreting adipokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, leptin, and adiponectin. Dysregulation of adipokines in adipose tissues leads to a chronic low-grade inflammation which could result in atherosclerosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. A sustained inflammatory state, which is characterized by prolonged persistence of macrophages and neutrophils, is found in diabetic wounds. In addition, subcutaneous adipocytes are enormously increased in amount clinically in type 2 diabetes. However, the function of subcutaneous adipocytes, which play an important role in injured tissue subjected to hypoxia, has not been well characterized in vitro due to the difficulty of maintaining mature adipocytes in culture using conventional methods because of their buoyancy. In this study, we established a novel in vitro culture method of mature adipocytes by enclosing them in a hyaluronan (HA) based hydrogel to study their role in response to stress such as hypoxia. BrdU labeling and Ki67 immunostaining experiments showed that hydrogel enclosed mature adipocytes proliferate in vitro. Both mRNA and protein expression analyses for hypoxia regulated genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), showed that mature adipocytes of wild type mice respond to hypoxia. In contrast, mature adipocytes of diabetic db/db and TallyHo mice did not efficiently respond to hypoxia. Our studies suggest that mature adipocytes are functionally active cells, and their abnormal function to hypoxia can be one of underlining mechanisms in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
CREB3L1/OASIS is a cellular transcription factor synthesized as a membrane-bound precursor and activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis in response to stimuli like ER stress. Comparing gene expression between Huh7 subclones that are permissive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication versus the nonpermissive parental Huh7 cells, we identified CREB3L1 as a host factor that inhibits proliferation of virus-infected cells. Upon infection with diverse DNA and RNA viruses, including murine γ-herpesvirus 68, HCV, West Nile virus (WNV), and Sendai virus, CREB3L1 was proteolytically cleaved, allowing its NH2 terminus to enter the nucleus and induce multiple genes encoding inhibitors of the cell cycle to block cell proliferation. Consistent with this, we observed a necessity for CREB3L1 expression to be silenced in proliferating cells that harbor replicons of HCV or WNV. Our results indicate that CREB3L1 may play an important role in limiting virus spread by inhibiting proliferation of virus-infected cells.

Abstract: The migration of vascular endothelial cells plays a critical role in a variety of vascular physiological and pathological processes, such as embryonic development, angiogenesis, wound healing, re-endothelialization, and vascular remodeling. This study clarified the role and mechanism of a new vascular homeostasis regulator, Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG), in the migration of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). A wound healing assay and transwell migration model showed that upregulation of CREG expression induced HUVEC migration and it was positively correlated with the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. Furthermore, wild type integrin-linked kinase reversed the poor mobility of CREG knock-down HUVECs; in contrast, kinase-dead integrin-linked kinase weakened the migration of HUVECs. We also studied the effect of CREG on HUVEC migration by the addition of an mTOR inhibitor, recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor165, neutralizing antibody of vascular endothelial growth factor165 and AKT siRNA, and we concluded that CREG induces endothelial cell migration by activating the integrin-linked kinase/AKT/mTOR/VEGF165 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The cuticle and epidermis of Caenorhabditis elegans provide the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Upon invasion by the fungal pathogen Drechmeria coniospora, C. elegans responds by upregulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the epidermis via activation of at least two pathways, a neuroendocrine TGF-β pathway and a p38 MAPK pathway. Here, we identify the sodium-neurotransmitter symporter SNF-12, a member of the solute carrier family (SLC6), as being essential for both these immune signaling pathways. We also identify the STAT transcription factor-like protein STA-2 as a direct physical interactor of SNF-12 and show that the two proteins function together to regulate AMP gene expression in the epidermis. Both SNF-12 and STA-2 act cell autonomously and specifically in the epidermis to govern the transcriptional response to fungal infection. These findings reveal an unorthodox mode of regulation for a STAT factor and highlight the molecular plasticity of innate immune signaling.

Abstract: The MUC6 mucin has a critical protective function in the normal stomach, pancreas and duodenum and is aberrantly expressed during the progression of some gastrointestinal cancers. Our aim was to determine whether MUC6 contributes to the etiology or progression of pancreatic cancer and elucidate the molecular basis of its involvement. Expression of MUC6 glycoprotein was examined in pancreatic cancer tissues by immunofluorescence and loss of MUC6 was observed. Next, to determine whether MUC6 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis by altering cell adhesion and invasion, recombinant MUC6 cDNA and separate MUC6 N-terminal and C-terminal domains were transfected into pancreatic, colorectal and breast cancer cell lines. The recombinant N- and C-terminal proteins were each seen to oligomerize under non-reducing conditions. Overexpression of both domains of the MUC6 glycoprotein significantly inhibited cell adhesion to matrix proteins (collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin and laminin) in LS 180 but not in PANC-1 cells. Moreover, the N- and C-terminal domains of MUC6 inhibited invasion of both LS 180 and PANC-1 cells by 40% and 70%, respectively, in comparison with controls. These results suggest that MUC6 may inhibit invasion of tumor cells through the basement membrane of the pancreatic duct and slow the development of infiltrating carcinoma.

Abstract: Besides in vivo models, co-cultures systems making use of Rat dorsal root ganglion explants/Schwann cells (SC) are widely used to essentially study myelination in vitro. In the case of animal models of demyelinating diseases, it is expected to reproduce a pathological process; conversely the co-cultures are primarily developed to study the myelination process and in the aim to use them to replace animals in experiences of myelin destruction or functional disturbances. We describe (in terms of protein expression kinetic) a new in vitro model of sensory neurons/SC co-cultures presenting the following advantages: both sensory neurons and SC originate from the same individual; sensory neurons and SC being dissociated, they can be co-cultured in monolayer, allowing an easier microscope observation; the co-culture can be maintained in a serum-free medium for at less three months, allowing kinetic studies of myelin formation both at a molecular and cellular level. Optimizing culture conditions permits to use 96-well culture plates; image analyses conducted with an automatic image analyzer allows rapid, accurate and quantitative expression of results. Finally, this system was proved by measuring the apparition of myelin protein to mimic in vitro the physiological process of in vivo myelination.

Abstract: Components of the mRNA processing body (P-body) regulate critical steps in mRNA storage, transport, translation and degradation. At the core of the P-body is the decapping complex, which removes the 5′ cap from de-adenylated mRNAs and mediates an irreversible step in mRNA degradation. The assembly of P-bodies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster has been previously described. Less is known about the assembly of mammalian P-bodies. To investigate the interactions that occur between components of mammalian P-bodies, we developed a fluorescence-based, two-hybrid assay system. The assay depends on the ability of one P-body component, fused to an exogenous nuclear localization sequence (NLS), to recruit other P-body components to the nucleus. The assay was used to investigate interactions between P-body components Ge-1, DCP2, DCP1, EDC3, RAP55, and RCK. The results of this study show that the modified two-hybrid assay can be used to identify protein interactions that occur in a macromolecular complex. The assay can also be used to efficiently detect protein interaction domains. The results provide important insights into mammalian P-body assembly and demonstrate similarities, and critical differences, between P-body assembly in mammalian cells compared with that of other species.

Abstract: The remodeling of extracellular matrix is a crucial mechanism in tendon development and the proliferation of fibroblasts is a key factor in this process. The purpose of this study was to further elucidate the role of TIEG1 in mediating important tenocyte properties throughout the aging process. Wildtype and TIEG1 knockout tenocytes adhesion, spreading and proliferation were characterized on different substrates (fibronectin, collagen type I, gelatin and laminin) and the expression levels of various genes known to be involved with tendon development were analyzed by RT-PCR. The experiments revealed age-dependent and substrate-dependent properties for both wildtype and TIEG1 knockout tenocytes. Taken together, our results indicate an important role for TIEG1 in regulating tenocytes adhesion, spreading, and proliferation throughout the aging process. Understanding the basic mechanisms of TIEG1 in tenocytes may provide valuable information for treating multiple tendon disorders.

Abstract: Due to their adjuvant effect and their ability to chaperone tumor-associated peptides, heat shock proteins constitute a potent alarm signal for the immune system and can lead to activation of anti-tumor T-cell immunity. Radiofrequency ablation has been reported to induce heat shock protein expression especially that of heat shock protein 70 in sublethally damaged tumor cells. In this study, we evaluated the release of heat shock protein 70 into the serum of cancer-bearing patients directly after radiofrequency ablation. Sera of 22 patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of primary and secondary malignancies of the liver, kidney, and lung, as well as control sera of 20 patients undergoing diagnostic liver biopsy were analyzed using a manufactured heat shock protein 70 ELISA. A significant increase in serum levels of heat shock protein 70 was detectable in the patient cohort 1 day after radiofrequency ablation. More than a twofold increase was observed in nine out of 22 patients, which tended to correlate with favorable clinical outcome. No patient of the control group revealed a comparable increase. Radiofrequency ablation can lead to a release of heat shock protein 70 into the serum, which is transiently detectable 1 day after treatment. Elevated heat shock protein 70 serum levels may constitute a biomarker for favorable clinical outcome.

Abstract: Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) is involved in the regulation of lipid-mediated signal transduction through the metabolism of a second messenger diacylglycerol. Of the DGK family, DGKζ, which contains a nuclear localization signal, localizes mainly to the nucleus but translocates to the cytoplasm under pathological conditions. However, the detailed mechanism of translocation and its functional significance remain unclear. To elucidate these issues, we used a proteomic approach to search for protein targets that interact with DGKζ. Results show that nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) 1-like 1 (NAP1L1) and NAP1-like 4 (NAP1L4) are identified as novel DGKζ binding partners. NAP1Ls constitutively shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in transfected HEK293 cells. The molecular interaction of DGKζ and NAP1Ls prohibits nuclear import of DGKζ because binding of NAP1Ls to DGKζ blocks import carrier proteins, Qip1 and NPI1, to interact with DGKζ, leading to cytoplasmic tethering of DGKζ. In addition, overexpression of NAP1Ls exerts a protective effect against doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that NAP1Ls are involved in a novel molecular basis for the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of DGKζ and provide a clue to examine functional significance of its translocation under pathological conditions.

Abstract: Small G protein superfamily consists of more than 150 members, and is classified into six families: the Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, Ran, and RGK families. They regulate a wide variety of cell functions such as cell proliferation/differentiation, cytoskeletal reorganization, vesicle trafficking, nucleocytoplasmic transport and microtubule organization. The small G proteins have also been shown to regulate cell death/survival and cell shape. In this study, we compared the role of representative members of the six families of small G proteins in cell migration and cell death/survival, two cellular phenotypes that are associated with inflammation, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. Our results show that small G proteins of the six families differentially regulate cell death and cell cycle distribution. In particular, our results indicate that Rho family of small G proteins is antiapoptotic. Ras, Rho, and Ran families promoted cell migration. There was no significant correlation between the cell death- and cell migration-regulating activities of the small G proteins. Nevertheless, RalA was not only cytoprotective against multiple chemotherapeutic drugs, but also promigratory inducing stress fiber formation, which was accompanied by the activation of Akt and Erk pathways. Our study provides a framework for further systematic investigation of small G proteins in the perspectives of cell death/survival and motility in inflammation and cancer.

Abstract: Endocytosis and transport of bovine liver β-glucuronidase to lysosomes in human fibroblasts are mediated by two receptors: the well-characterized cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (IGF-II/Man6PR) and an IGF-II/Man6PR-independent receptor, which recognizes a Ser-Trp*-Ser sequence present on the ligand. The latter receptor was detergent extracted from bovine liver membranes and purified. LC/ESI–MS/MS analysis revealed that this endocytic receptor was annexin VI (AnxA6). Several approaches were used to confirm this finding. First, the binding of bovine β-glucuronidase to the purified receptor from bovine liver membranes and His-tagged recombinant human AnxA6 protein was confirmed using ligand-blotting assays. Second, western blot analysis using antibodies raised against IGF-II/Man6PR-independent receptor as well as commercial antibodies against AnxA6 confirmed that the receptor and AnxA6 were indeed the same protein. Third, double immunofluorescence experiments in human fibroblasts confirmed a complete colocalization of the bovine β-glucuronidase and the AnxA6 receptor on the plasma membrane. Lastly, two cell lines were stably transfected with a plasmid containing the cDNA for human AnxA6. In both transfected cell lines, an increase in cell surface AnxA6 and in mannose 6-phosphate-independent endocytosis of bovine β-glucuronidase was detected. These results indicate that AnxA6 is a novel receptor that mediates the endocytosis of the bovine β-glucuronidase.

Abstract: Over the past decade, evidence continues to mount showing that N-cadherin is a critical protein in cancer progression and metastasis. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of N-cadherin in human prostate cancer tissue specimens and cell lines. Enhanced expression of N-cadherin was observed in both the malignant and bone-metastasized prostate tissue specimens compared to the healthy prostate tissues. Consistent with the tissue array data, N-cadherin was highly expressed in PC3, but not in Du145 and LNCaP human prostate cell lines. Based on cell to cell binding assay, we found that N-cadherin expression facilitates homotypic interaction between human prostate cancer cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC). Human angiogenesis antibody array and in vitro angiogenesis assay showed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of N-cadherin reduced the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which played a potential role in stimulating capillary network formation of HMEC. Additionally, culture supernatant of Du145 cells transfected with full-length N-cadherin expressing plasmid showed increased MCP-1 expression and chemoattractant ability compared to normal Du145 cells. Further, we noticed that blocking PI3K activity inhibited N-cadherin mediated MCP-1 expression. Our data demonstrated that N-cadherin in prostate cancer cell mediates cell–cell adhesion and regulates MCP-1 expression via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Abstract: Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are promising candidates for cell-based therapy of neurodegenerative diseases; however, safety concerns must be addressed through transplantation studies in large animal models, such as the pig. The aim of this study was to derive NPCs from porcine blastocysts and evaluate their in-vitro differentiation potential. Epiblasts were manually isolated from expanded hatched blastocysts and cultured on MEF feeder cells. Outgrowth colonies were passaged to MS5 cells and rosettes were further passaged to Matrigel-coated dishes containing bFGF and EGF. Three NPC lines were established which showed expression of SOX2, NESTIN and VIMENTIN. One line was characterised in more detail, retaining a normal karyotype and proliferating for more than three months in culture. Following differentiation, TUJI was significantly up-regulated in protocol 2 (RA and SHH; 58% positive cells) as were NF and TH. In contrast, MBP was significantly up-regulated in protocol 3 (FGF8 and SHH; 63% positive cells), whereas, GFAP was significantly up-regulated in protocols 1–4 (33%, 25%, 43% and 22%). The present study provides the first report of a porcine blastocyst-derived NPC line capable of differentiating into both neurons and glia, which may be of paramount importance for future transplantation studies in large animal models of neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Preliminary data showed that α1-adrenergic antagonists induce apoptosis and a switch towards megakaryocytic differentiation in human erythroleukemia cells. To test the hypothesis whether survival and differentiation of erythroleukemia cells are under control of α1-adrenergic signalling, we examined α1-adrenoceptor expression of erythroleukemia cells and compared the in vitro effects of α-adrenergic antagonists with those of agonists. We discovered that α1-adrenergic agonists suppress both erythroid differentiation and growth of erythroleukemia cells concomitant with lipofuscin accumulation, autophagy and necrotic cell death. α1-adrenergic agonists also inhibit the in vitro growth of physiologic hematopoietic progenitors obtained from umbilical cord blood with high selectivity for the erythroid lineage. Interestingly, the observed effects could not be related to α1-adrenoceptors, even though agonists and antagonists displayed opposing effects regarding cellular growth and differentiation of erythroleukemia cells. Our data suggest that the effects of α1-adrenergic drugs are related to a non-adrenoceptor binding site, controlling the fate of erythroid progenitor cells towards differentiation and cell death. Since the observed effects are not mediated through adrenoceptors, the physiologic relevance of our data remains unclear, so far. Nevertheless, the identification of the still unknown binding site(s) might disclose new insights into regulation of erythroid differentiation and cell death.

Abstract: The novel tight junction protein marvelD3 contains a conserved MARVEL (MAL and related proteins for vesicle trafficking and membrane link) domain like occludin and tricellulin. However, little is yet known about the detailed role and regulation of marvelD3 in normal epithelial cells and cancer cells, including pancreatic cancer. In the present study, we investigated marvelD3 expression in well and poorly differentiated human pancreatic cancer cell lines and normal pancreatic duct epithelial cells in which the hTERT gene was introduced into human pancreatic duct epithelial cells in primary culture, and the changes of marvelD3 during Snail-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) under hypoxia, TGF-β treatment and knockdown of FOXA2 in well differentiated pancreatic cancer HPAC cells. MarvelD3 was transcriptionally downregulated in poorly differentiated pancreatic cancer cells and during Snail-induced EMT of pancreatic cancer cells in which Snail was highly expressed and the fence function downregulated, whereas it was maintained in well differentiated human pancreatic cancer cells and normal pancreatic duct epithelial cells. Depletion of marvelD3 by siRNAs in HPAC cells resulted in downregulation of barrier functions indicated as a decrease in transepithelial electric resistance and an increase of permeability to fluorescent dextran tracers, whereas it did not affect fence function of tight junctions. In conclusion, marvelD3 is transcriptionally downregulated in Snail-induced EMT during the progression for the pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: The study of in vitro morphogenesis is fundamental to understanding neoplasia since the dysregulation of morphogenic pathways that create multi-cellular organisms is a common hallmark of oncogenesis. The in vitro culture of human breast epithelial cells on reconstituted basement membranes recapitulate some features of in vivo breast development, including the formation of a three-dimensional structure termed an acinus. Importantly, the capacity to disrupt in vitro acinar morphogenesis is a common property of human breast oncogenes. In this report, we find that phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KIIIβ), a lipid kinase that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) to PI(4)P, disrupts in vitro mammary acinar formation. The PI4KIIIβ protein localizes to the basal surface of acini created by human MCF10A cells and ectopic expression of PI4KIIIβ induces multi-acinar devlopment. Furthermore, expression of an oncogenic PI4KIIIβ activator, eEF1A2 (eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha 2), phenocopies the PI4KIIIβ multi-acinar phenotype. Ectopic expression of PI4KIIIβ or eEF1A2 alters the localization of PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2 within acini, indicating the importance of these lipids in acinar development. Our work shows that PI4KIIIβ, eEF1A2 and PI(4)P likely play an important role in mammary neoplasia and acinar development.

Abstract: Iron is essential in cellular proliferation and survival based on its crucial roles in DNA and ATP synthesis. Tumor cells proliferate rapidly even in patients with low serum iron, although their actual mechanisms are not well known. To elucidate molecular mechanisms of efficient tumor progression under the hypoferric condition, we studied the roles of six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate family member 3 (STEAP3), which was reported to facilitate iron uptake. Using Raji cells with low STEAP3 mRNA expression, human STEAP3-overexpressing cells were established. The impact of STEAP3 expression was analyzed about the amount of iron storage, the survival under hypoferric conditions in vitro and the growth of tumor in vivo. STEAP3 overexpression increased ferritin, an indicator of iron storage, in STEAP3-overexpressing Raji cells. STEAP3 gave Raji cells the resistance to iron deprivation-induced apoptosis. These STEAP3-overexpressing Raji cells preserved efficient growth even in hypoferric mice, while parental Raji cells grew less rapidly. In addition, iron deficiency enhanced STEAP3 mRNA expression in tumor cells. Furthermore, human colorectal cancer tissues exhibited more STEAP3 mRNA expression and iron storage compared with normal colon mucosa. These findings indicate that STEAP3 maintains iron storage in human malignant cells and tumor proliferation under the hypoferric condition.

Abstract: Summary
Selective autophagy of bacterial pathogens represents a host innate immune mechanism. Selective autophagy has been characterized on the basis of distinct cargo receptors but the mechanisms by which different cargo receptors are targeted for autophagic degradation remain unclear. In this study we identified a highly conserved Tectonin domain-containing protein, Tecpr1, as an Atg5 binding partner that colocalized with Atg5 at Shigella-containing phagophores. Tecpr1 activity is necessary for efficient autophagic targeting of bacteria, but has no effect on rapamycin- or starvation-induced canonical autophagy. Tecpr1 interacts with WIPI-2, a yeast Atg18 homolog and PI(3)P-interacting protein required for phagophore formation, and they colocalize to phagophores. Although Tecpr1-deficient mice appear normal, Tecpr1-deficient MEFs were defective for selective autophagy and supported increased intracellular multiplication of Shigella. Further, depolarized mitochondria and misfolded protein aggregates accumulated in the Tecpr1-knockout MEFs. Thus, we identify a Tecpr1-dependent pathway as important in targeting bacterial pathogens for selective autophagy.

Abstract: ORP7 is a member of oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family, the function of which has remained obscure. In this study, we identified by yeast two-hybrid screening an interaction partner of ORP7, GATE-16, which (i) regulates Golgi SNARE of 28kDa (GS28) function and stability, and (ii) plays a role in autophagosome biogenesis. The interaction was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in living cells. The interacting regions were delineated within aa 1–142 of ORP7 and aa 30–117 of GATE-16. ORP7 knock-down in 293A cells resulted in a 40% increase of GS28 protein while ORP7 overexpression had the opposite effect (25% decrease of GS28). We show evidence that the regulation of GS28 by ORP7 does not occur at the level of transcription, but involves degradation of GS28 on proteasomes. Truncated ORP7 that lacks the GATE-16 binding region failed to affect GS28 stability, evidencing for specificity of the observed effect. Similar to ORP7 overexpression, treatment of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) resulted in GS28 destabilization, which was potentiated by excess ORP7 and inhibited by ORP7 silencing. Overexpression of ORP7 led in most cells to formation of vacuolar structures positive for RFP-LC3, thus representing autophagic elements. Also GATE-16 was found in the vacuolar ORP7-positive elements, suggesting that excess ORP7 increases entrapment of GATE-16 in autophagosomes. Taken together, our results suggest that ORP7 negatively regulates GS28 protein stability via sequestration of GATE-16, and may mediate the effect of 25-OH on GS28 and Golgi function.

Abstract: Our previous study showed that pretreatment with 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF) led to protection against hypoxic injury via a p-ERK-mediated pathway in vitro. Whether the protection of 5-HMF against hypoxia is effective in vivo is unknown. The present study is aimed to verify the role of 5-HMF in acute hypobaric hypoxia using Kunming mice as an in vivo model and further investigate the underlying mechanisms. Mice pretreated with or without 5-HMF for 1 h were exposed to acute hypobaric hypoxic condition for 6 h and then the survival time, the survival rate, the permeability of blood–brain barrier (BBB), the histological analysis in hippocampus and cortex, and the phosphorylation level of mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK, JNK, and p38) were investigated. The results showed that 5-HMF significantly increased the survival time and the survival rate of mice. Accordingly, pretreatment with 5-HMF markedly attenuated acute hypobaric hypoxia-induced permeability of BBB (P < 0.01). In addition, the cellular damage extent of the hippocampus and the cortex induced by hypoxia for 6 h was also attenuated by pretreatment with 5-HMF, especially in the hippocampus CA1 region. Furthermore, the activation of ERK rather than JNK and p38 was involved in the protection of 5-HMF against acute hypobaric hypoxia. In summary, 5-HMF enhanced the survival capability of mice and decreased acute hypoxic damage to the brain, which may be associated with the effects on BBB and p-ERK.

Abstract: Summary
During natural transmission, bunyaviruses are introduced into the skin through arthropod bites, and dermal dendritic cells (DCs) are the first to encounter incoming viruses. DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin highly expressed on the surface of dermal DCs. We found that several arthropod-borne phleboviruses (Bunyaviridae), including Rift Valley fever and Uukuniemi viruses, exploit DC-SIGN to infect DCs and other DC-SIGN-expressing cells. DC-SIGN binds the virus directly via interactions with high-mannose N-glycans on the viral glycoproteins and is required for virus internalization and infection. In live cells, virus-induced clustering of cell surface DC-SIGN could be visualized. An endocytosis-defective mutant of DC-SIGN was unable to mediate virus uptake, indicating that DC-SIGN is an authentic receptor required for both attachment and endocytosis. After internalization, viruses separated from DC-SIGN and underwent trafficking to late endosomes. Our study provides real-time visualization of virus-receptor interactions on the cell surface and establishes DC-SIGN as a phlebovirus entry receptor.

Abstract: The extracellular matrix (ECM) contains important cues for tissue homeostasis and morphogenesis. The matricellular protein tenascin-C (TN-C) is overexpressed in remodeling tissues and cancer. In the present work, we studied the effect of different ECM—which exhibited a significant diversity in their TN-C content—in endothelial survival, proliferation and tubulogenic differentiation: autologous (endothelial) ECM devoid of TN-C, but bearing large amounts of FN; fibroblast ECM, bearing both high TN-C and FN contents; and finally, glioma-derived matrices, usually poor in FN, but very rich in TN-C. HUVECs initially adhered to the immobilized matrix produced by U373 MG glioma cells, but significantly detached and died by anoikis (50 to 80%) after 24h, as compared with cells incubated with endothelial and fibroblast matrices. Surviving endothelial cells (20 to 50%) became up to 6-fold more proliferative and formed 74–97% less tube-like structures in vitro than cells grown on non-tumoral matrices. An antibody against the EGF-like repeats of tenascin-C (TN-C) partially rescued cells from the tubulogenic defect, indicating that this molecule is responsible for the selection of highly proliferative and tubulogenic defective endothelial cells. Interestingly, by using defined substrata, in conditions that mimic glioma and normal cell ECM composition, we observed that fibronectin (FN) modulates the TN-C-induced selection of endothelial cells. Our data show that TN-C is able to modulate endothelial branching morphogenesis in vitro and, since it is prevalent in matrices of injured and tumor tissues, also suggest a role for this protein in vascular morphogenesis, in these physiological contexts.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are regarded as a promising source of cell-based therapy for heart injury. In fact, less than 30% of MSCs contribute to cardiomyocytes differentiation, and the isolation procedure and biological characteristics of this population of cells remain unknown. Here we isolate and investigate the biological characteristics of this subpopulation of MSCs. Twenty four MSC clones were randomly selected using single-cell monoclonal technology. After induced with 5-azacytidine, eight clones displayed cardiomyocyte-like morphologies, and highly (over 90%) expressed cardiac-specific markers cTnT and α-actin, and displayed transient outward K+ current (Ito), inwardly rectifying K+ current (IK1) and delayed rectifier K+ current (IKDR), which were typical of cardiomocytes. Other clones merely showed Ito current, and the current densities were different from those of cardiomyocytes. In contrast to the other clones, before induced with 5-azacytidine, the eight clones expressed early cardiac markers GATA4 and NKX2.5, but not cTnT, α-actin, CD44 and CD90, and had no potentials for adiopogenesis, osteogenesis or chondrogenesis after induction. Our data suggest that the subgroup of MSCs that contributes to cardiomyocytes differentiation is cardiac progenitor cells. Moreover, we show the preliminary purification of this population of cells with a high potential for cardiomyocytes differentiation using single-cell monoclonal technology.

Abstract: The stigmoid body (STB) is a cytoplasmic inclusion containing huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1), and HAP1/STB formation is induced by transfection of the HAP1 gene into cultured cells. In the present study, we examined the intracellular colocalization of HAP1/STBs with steroid hormone receptors (SHRs), including the androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptor, in COS-7 cells cotransfected with HAP1 and each receptor. We found that C-terminal ligand-binding domains of all SHRs had potential for colocalization with HAP1/STBs, whereas only AR and GR were clearly colocalized with HAP1/STBs when each full-length SHR was coexpressed with HAP1. In addition, it appeared that HAP1/STBs did not disrupt GR and AR functions because the receptors on HAP1/STBs maintained nuclear translocation activity in response to their specific ligands. When the cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor, GR and AR localized outside HAP1/STBs translocated into the nucleus, whereas the receptors colocalized with HAP1/STBs persisted in their colocalization even after treatment with their ligands. Therefore, HAP1/STBs may be involved in cytoplasmic modifications of the nuclear translocation of GR and AR in a ubiquitin–proteasome system.

Abstract: Intestinal celiac disease (CD) is triggered by peptic-tryptic digest of gluten, known as Frazer's Fraction (FF), in genetically predisposed individuals. Here, we investigate the immediate effects of FF on the actin cytoskeleton and the subsequent trafficking of actin-dependent and actin-independent proteins in COS-1 cells. Morphological alterations in the actin filaments were revealed concomitant with a drastic reduction in immunoprecipitated actin from cells incubated with FF. These alterations elicit impaired protein trafficking of intestinal sucrase–isomaltase, a glycoprotein that follows an actin-dependent vesicular transport to the cell surface. However, the actin-independent transport of intestinal lactase phlorizin hydrolase remains unaffected. Moreover, the morphological alteration in actin is induced by direct interaction of this protein with gliadin peptides carrying the QQQPFP epitope revealed by co-immunoprecipitation utilizing a monoclonal anti-gliadin antibody. Finally, stimulation of cells with FF directly influences the binding of actin to Arp2. Altogether, our data demonstrate that FF directly interacts with actin and alters the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton thus leading to an impaired trafficking of intestinal proteins that depend on an intact actin network. This direct interaction could be related to the endocytic segregation of gliadin peptides as well as the delayed endocytic vesicle trafficking and maturation in gliadin-positive intestinal epithelial cells and opens new insights into the pathogenesis of CD.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are typically cultured on fibroblast feeder cells or in fibroblast conditioned medium supplemented with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2, also known as bFGF). FGF signaling appears to be important for hESC self-renewal and is required to enable the culture of hESCs in an undifferentiated state. In this study, we generated a transgenic fibroblast feeder line stably expressing a secretable FGF4 signal peptide tagged hFGF2 (4SP-hFGF2). The expression of this transgene functionally replaced the requirement for exogenous FGF2 when using these cells as feeders for the maintenance of hESCs. Under these conditions, hESCs maintained the typical marker of pluripotency assessed after long term culture, while still retaining the capacity for differentiation to all three germ layers. This transgene could be applied to mass produce 4SP-hFGF2 protein, serving to be an economical and effective strategy for culturing pluripotent stem cells as feeder cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cell migration and invasion require the coordinated regulation of cytoskeletal architectural changes by signaling factors, including the actin-binding protein cortactin. Bacterial and viral pathogens subvert these signaling factors to promote their uptake, spread and dissemination. We show that the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (Hp) targets cortactin by two independent processes leading to its tyrosine dephosphorylation and serine phosphorylation to regulate cell scattering and elongation. The phosphorylation status of cortactin dictates its subcellular localization and signaling partners. Upon infection, cortactin was found to interact with and stimulate the kinase activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). This interaction required the SH3 domain and phosphorylation of cortactin at serine 405 and a proline-rich sequence in FAK. Using Hp as a model, this study unravels a previously unrecognized FAK activation pathway. We propose that Hp targets cortactin to protect the gastric epithelium from excessive cell lifting and ensure sustained infection in the stomach.

Abstract: Summary
Sequence variation of antigenic proteins allows pathogens to evade antibody attack. The variable protein commonly includes a hypervariable region (HVR), which represents a key target for antibodies and is therefore predicted to be immunodominant. To understand the mechanism(s) of antibody evasion, we analyzed the clinically important HVR-containing M proteins of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. Antibodies elicited by M proteins were directed almost exclusively against the C-terminal part and not against the N-terminal HVR. Similar results were obtained for mice and humans with invasive S. pyogenes infection. Nevertheless, only anti-HVR antibodies protected efficiently against infection, as shown by passive immunizations. The HVR fused to an unrelated protein elicited no antibodies, implying that it is inherently weakly immunogenic. These data indicate that the M protein HVR evades antibody attack not only through antigenic variation but also by weak immunogenicity, a paradoxical observation that may apply to other HVR-containing proteins.

Abstract: Lymphatic vessels guide interstitial fluid, modulate immune responses by regulating leukocyte and antigen trafficking to lymph nodes, and in a cancer setting enable tumor cells to track to regional lymph nodes. The aim of the study was to determine whether primary murine lymphatic endothelial cells (mLECs) show conserved vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathways with human LECs (hLECs). LECs were successfully isolated from murine dermis and prostate. Similar to hLECs, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family ligands activated MAPK and pAkt intracellular signaling pathways in mLECs. We describe a robust protocol for isolation of mLECs which, by harnessing the power of transgenic and knockout mouse models, will be a useful tool to study how LEC phenotype contributes to alterations in lymphatic vessel formation and function.

Abstract: Objectives
Our purpose was to investigate the role of the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway in the regulation of ciliary beat frequency (CBF) in mouse nasal and tracheal epithelial cells.
Methods
We studied the effects of the NO donor l-arginine (L-Arg) and specific inhibitors of the NO signaling pathway on CBF of both nasal and tracheal epithelial cells by using high-speed digital microscopy. We also examined eNOS, sGC β, PKG I and acetylated α tubulin expression in native mouse nasal and tracheal epithelium using immunohistochemical methods.
Results
L-Arg significantly increased CBF of cultured nasal and tracheal epithelial cells, and the effects were blocked by pretreatment with NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a NOS inhibitor, with LY-83583, a sGC inhibitor, or with KT-5823, a PKG inhibitor. Positive immunostaining for NO signaling molecules including eNOS, sGC β and PKG I was observed in either nasal or tracheal ciliated epithelium.
Conclusion
NO plays a role in regulating CBF of mouse respiratory epithelial cells via a eNOS–NO–sGC β–cGMP–PKG I pathway.

Abstract: Grp94 is the main endoplasmic reticulum-resident heat shock protein (HSP) that besides chaperoning native proteins, displays important modulatory effects on both the innate and adaptive immune response. Since the knowledge of a direct influence of Grp94 on the humoral response is lacking, in this work we tested the effect of Grp94 on Ig secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of five normal volunteers. The concentration of Ig secreted in the medium after incubation of 15 days was found increased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of Grp94, used at the final concentrations of 10 and 100 ng/ml. However, by measuring the Ig secretion at different incubation times, it was apparent that maximal percent stimulation by Grp94 occurred at 7 days, decreasing thereafter. In addition, the pattern of Ig secretion in time significantly differed in the presence of Grp94 with respect to that of control PBMCs. Grp94 also stimulated in a dose-dependent manner the PBMC proliferation, an effect that preceded the Ig secretion and was accompanied by morphological changes of cells similar to those induced by the pokeweed mitogen. Effects of Grp94 on PBMCs were mediated by an intense activation of the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway and by an increased expression of HSP90. Results indicate that Grp94 can activate the humoral response by a cytokine-like, cell-mediated mechanism that leads to an accelerated process of B cell maturation and differentiation.

Abstract: Notch signaling involves the proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane Notch receptor after binding to its transmembrane ligands. Jagged-1 also undergoes proteolytic cleavage by gamma-secretase and releases an intracellular fragment. In this study, we have demonstrated that the Jagged-1 intracellular domain (JICD) inhibits Notch1 signaling via a reduction in the protein stability of the Notch1 intracellular domain (Notch1-IC). The formation of the Notch1-IC-RBP-Jk-Mastermind complex is prevented in the presence of JICD, via a physical interaction. Furthermore, JICD accelerates the protein degradation of Notch1-IC via Fbw7-dependent proteasomal pathway. These results indicate that JICD functions as a negative regulator in Notch1 signaling via the promotion of Notch1-IC degradation.

Abstract: B-cell activating factor (BAFF) plays a role in the generation and the maintenance of mature B cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased BAFF expression through the activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent signal transduction. Here, we investigated the mechanism of action on mouse BAFF (mBAFF) expression by cAMP production in Raw264.7 mouse macrophages. mBAFF expression was increased by the treatment with a cAMP analogue, dibutyryl-cAMP which is the activator of protein kinase A (PKA), cAMP effector protein. PKA activation was measured by the phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) on serine 133 (S133). cAMP production and CREB (S133) phosphorylation were augmented by LPS-stimulation. While mBAFF promoter activity was enhanced by the co-transfection with pS6-RSV-CREB, it was reduced by siRNA-CREB. PKA inhibitor, H-89, reduced CREB (S133) phosphorylation and mBAFF expression in control and LPS-stimulated macrophages. Another principal cAMP effector protein is cAMP-responsive guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Epac), a Rap GDP exchange factor. Epac was activated by the treatment with 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (CPT), Epac activator, as judged by the measurement of Rap1 activation. Basal level of mBAFF expression was increased by CPT treatment. LPS-stimulated mBAFF expression was also slightly enhanced by co-treatment with CPT. In addition, dibutyryl-cAMP and CPT enhanced mBAFF expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). With these data, it suggests that the activation of PKA and cAMP/Epac1/Rap1 pathways could be required for basal mBAFF expression, as well as being up-regulated in the TLR4-induced mBAFF expression.

Abstract: Thiazolidinediones, specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) ligands, used in type-2 diabetes therapy, show favourable effects in several cancer cells. In this study we demonstrate that the growth of H295R and SW13 adrenocortical cancer cells is inhibited by rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinediones member, even though the mechanisms underlying this effect appeared to be cell-specific. Treatment with GW9662, a selective PPAR-γ-inhibitor, showed that rosiglitazone acts through both PPAR-γ-dependent and -independent mechanisms in H295R, while in SW13 cells the effect seems to be independent of PPAR-γ. H295R cells treated with rosiglitazone undergo an autophagic process, leading to morphological changes detectable by electron microscopy and an increased expression of specific proteins such as AMPKα and beclin-1. The autophagy seems to be independent of PPAR-γ activation and could be related to an increase in oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen species production with the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, triggered by rosiglitazone. In SW13 cells, flow cytometry analysis showed an arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle with a decrease of cyclin E and cdk2 activity, following the administration of rosiglitazone. Our data show the potential role of rosiglitazone in the therapeutic approach to adrenocortical carcinoma and indicate the molecular mechanisms at the base of its antiproliferative effects, which appear to be manifold and cell-specific in adrenocortical cancer lines.

Abstract: Ku, the heterodimer of Ku70 and Ku80, plays an essential role in the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway, i.e., non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Two isoforms of Ku80 encoded by the same genes, namely, Ku80 and KARP-1 are expressed and function in primate cells, but not in rodent cells. Ku80 works as a heterodimer with Ku70. However, it is not yet clear whether KARP-1 forms a heterodimer with Ku70 and works as a heterodimer. Although KARP-1 appears to work in NHEJ, its physiological role remains unclear. In this study, we established and characterized EGFP-KARP-1-expressing xrs-6 cell lines, EGFP-KARP-1/xrs-6. We found that nuclear localization signal (NLS) of KARP-1 is localized in the C-terminal region. Our data showed that KARP-1 localizes within the nucleus in NLS-dependent and NLS-independent manner and forms a heterodimer with Ku70, and stabilizes Ku70. On the other hand, EGFP-KARP-1 could not perfectly complement the radiosensitivity and DSB repair activity of Ku80-deficient xrs-6 cells. Furthermore, KARP-1 could not accumulate at DSBs faster than Ku80, although EGFP-KARP-1 accumulates at DSBs. Our data demonstrate that the function of KARP-1 could not perfectly replace that of Ku80 in DSB repair, although KARP-1 has some biochemical properties, which resemble those of Ku80, and works as a heterodimer with Ku70. On the other hand, the number of EGFP-KARP-1-expressing xrs-6 cells showing pan-nuclear γ-H2AX staining significantly increases following X-irradiation, suggesting that KARP-1 may have a novel role in DSB response.

Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that a proapoptotic cyclic peptide CIGB-300, formerly known as P15-Tat delivered into the cells by the cell-penetrating peptide Tat, was able to abrogate the CK2-mediated phosphorylation and induce tumor regression when injected directly into solid tumors in mice or by systemic administration. In this work, we studied the role of CIGB-300 on the main events that take place in angiogenesis. At non-cytotoxic doses, CIGB-300 was able to inhibit adhesion, migration, and tubular network formation induced by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) growing upon Matrigel in vitro. Likewise, we evaluated the cellular penetration and localization into the HUVEC cells of CIGB-300. Our results confirmed a quick cellular penetration and a cytoplasmic accumulation in the early minutes of incubation and a translocation into the nuclei beginning at 12h of treatment, with a strong presence in the perinuclear area. A microarray analysis was used to determine the genes affected by the treatment. We observed that CIGB-300 significantly decreased four genes strongly associated with tubulogenesis, growth, and differentiation of endothelial cells. The CIGB-300 was tested in vivo on chicken embryo chorioallantoic membranes (CAM), and a large number of newly formed blood vessels were significantly regressed. The results suggested that CIGB-300 has a potential as an antiangiogenic treatment. The mechanism of action may be associated with partial inhibition of VEGF and Notch pathways.

Abstract: Cellular response to hypoxia plays an important role in both circulatory and pulmonary diseases and cancer. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are major transcription factors regulating the response to hypoxia. The α-subunits of HIFs are hydroxylated by members of the prolyl-4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) family, PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3, in an oxygen-dependent manner. Here, we report on the identification of ATF4 as a protein interacting with PHD1 as well as PHD3, but not with PHD2. The central region of ATF4 including the Zipper II domain, ODD domain and β-TrCP recognition motif were involved in the interaction with PHD1. Coexistence of PHD1 stabilized ATF4, as opposed to the destabilization of ATF4 by PHD3. Moreover, coexpression of ATF4 destabilized PHD3, whereas PHD1 stability was not affected by the presence of ATF4. Mutations to alanine of proline residues in ATF4 that satisfied hydroxylation consensus by PHDs did not affect binding activity of ATF4 to PHD1 and PHD3. Furthermore, in vitro prolyl hydroxylation assay clearly indicated that ATF4 did not serve as a substrate of both PHD1 and PHD3. Coexpression of PHD1 or PHD3 with ATF4 repressed the transcriptional activity of ATF4. These results suggest that PHD1 and PHD3 control the transactivation activity of ATF4.

Abstract: In keratinocytes the human Bag-1 gene produces three different protein isoforms from a single messenger RNA, BAG-1L, BAG-1M and BAG-1S. In this study we questioned whether BAG-1L or the shorter isoforms would promote keratinocyte differentiation in organotypic cultures of HaCaT. HaCaT parental and vector cells showed stratification, but terminal differentiation was not complete. Cultures overexpressing BAG-1L isoform-specifically were of increased thickness, demonstrated pronounced expression of basal cytokeratin 5 and β1-integrin, suprabasal involucrin, cytokeratin 1 and plasma membrane-localised filaggrin, and a marked keratinized layer of cells at the surface. We were unable to overexpress BAG-1S and BAG-1M isoform-specifically. Overexpression of BAG-1M gave rise to organotypic cultures intermediate in differentiation to controls and those overexpressing BAG-1L. Cells overexpressing BAG-1S also exhibited elevated endogenous BAG-1. These produced slow growing cultures with high levels of basal cytokeratin 5, but little involucrin or cytokeratin 1. Suprabasal β1-integrin and Ki67 positive cells indicated defective stratification. The results suggest that BAG-1L potentiates epidermal differentiation, but disruption in the relative balance of isoforms towards overexpression of BAG-1S can lead to defective tissue patterning. Hence, a delicate balance of BAG-1 isoforms may be required to regulate normal epidermal stratification and differentiation, with important implications for aberrant differentiation in cancer.

Abstract: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are multifunctional signaling molecules that have gained increasing interest in cancer research. To obtain a systematic view on BMP signaling in pancreatic cancer we first determined the mRNA expression levels of seven BMP ligands (BMP2–BMP8) and six BMP specific receptors in pancreatic cancer cell lines and normal pancreatic tissue. BMP receptor expression was seen in all cancer and normal samples. Low expression levels of BMP5 and BMP8 were detected in cancer cells compared to the normal samples, whereas BMP4 expression was elevated in 25% of the cases. The impact of BMP4 and BMP5 signaling on cell phenotype was then evaluated in five pancreatic cancer cell lines. Both ligands suppressed the growth of three cell lines (up to 79% decrease in BMP4-treated PANC-1 cells), mainly due to cell cycle changes. BMP4 and BMP5 concurrently increased cell migration and invasion (maximally a 10.8-fold increase in invaded BMP4-treated PANC-1 cells). The phenotypic changes were typically associated with the activation of the canonical SMAD pathway, although such activation was not observed in the PANC-1 cells. Taken together, BMP4 and BMP5 simultaneously inhibit the growth and promote migration and invasion of the same pancreatic cells and thus exhibit a biphasic role with both detrimental and beneficial functions in pancreatic cancer progression.

Abstract: Research into muscle atrophy and hypertrophy is hampered by limitations of the available experimental models. Interpretation of in vivo experiments is confounded by the complexity of the environment while in vitro models are subject to the marked disparities between cultured myotubes and the mature myofibres of living tissues. Here we develop a method (PhAct) based on ex vivo maintenance of the isolated myofibre as a model of disuse atrophy, using standard microscopy equipment and widely available analysis software, to measure f-actin content per myofibre and per nucleus over two weeks of ex vivo maintenance. We characterize the 35% per week atrophy of the isolated myofibre in terms of early changes in gene expression and investigate the effects on loss of muscle mass of modulatory agents, including Myostatin and Follistatin. By tracing the incorporation of a nucleotide analogue we show that the observed atrophy is not associated with loss or replacement of myonuclei. Such a completely controlled investigation can be conducted with the myofibres of a single muscle. With this novel method we can distinguish those features and mechanisms of atrophy and hypertrophy that are intrinsic to the muscle fibre from those that include activities of other tissues and systemic agents.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammasomes are cytoplasmic sensors of foreign molecules, including pathogens, and function to induce caspase-1 activation and IL-1β cytokine maturation. Whether such a mechanism exists in the nucleus and is effective against nuclear replicating pathogens is unknown. Nuclear replicating herpesvirus KSHV is associated with Kaposi Sarcoma, an angioproliferative tumor characterized by an inflammatory microenvironment including IL-1β. We demonstrate that during KSHV infection of endothelial cells, interferon gamma-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) interacts with the adaptor molecule ASC and procaspase-1 to form a functional inflammasome. This complex was initially detected in the nucleus and subsequently in the perinuclear area. KSHV gene expression and/or latent KSHV genome is required for inflammasome activation and IFI16 colocalizes with the KSHV genome in the infected cell nucleus. Caspase-1 activation by KSHV was reduced by IFI16 and ASC silencing. Our studies reveal IFI16 as a nuclear pathogen sensor and demonstrate that the inflammasome also functions in the nucleus.

Abstract: Chronic repeated exposure to hyperthermia in humans results in heat acclimation (HA), an adaptive process that is attained in humans by repeated exposure to hyperthermia and is characterized by improved heat elimination and increased exercise capacity, and acquired thermal tolerance (ATT), a cellular response characterized by increased baseline heat shock protein (HSP) expression and blunting of the acute increase in HSP expression stimulated by re-exposure to thermal stress. Epidemiologic studies in military personnel operating in hot environments and elite athletes suggest that repeated exposure to hyperthermia may also exert long-term health effects. Animal models demonstrate that coincident exposure to mild hyperthermia or prior exposure to severe hyperthermia can profoundly affect the course of experimental infection and injury, but these models do not represent HA. In this study, we demonstrate that CD-1 mice continuously exposed to mild hyperthermia (ambient temperature ~37°C causing ~2°C increase in core temperature) for 5 days and then exposed to a thermal stress (42°C ambient temperature for 40 min) exhibited some of the salient features of human HA, including (1) slower warming during thermal stress and more rapid cooling during recovery and (2) increased activity during thermal stress, as well as some of the features of ATT, including (1) increased baseline expression of HSP72 and HSP90 in lung, heart, spleen, liver, and brain; and (2) blunted incremental increase in HSP72 expression following acute thermal stress. This study suggests that continuous 5-day exposure of CD-1 mice to mild hyperthermia induces a state that resembles the physiologic and cellular responses of human HA. This model may be useful for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of HA and its consequences on host responsiveness to subsequent stresses.

Abstract: TNFα stimulation triggers both cell death and survival programs. Since dysregulated apoptosis or cell growth can cause inflammatory diseases, cancer, or autoimmune disorders, it is important to understand the molecular mechanism of controlling cell death and survival by TNFR downstream signaling molecules. In this study, we used normal diploid cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), to mimic the general TNFα-resistant phenomenon seen under physiological conditions. We elucidated the TNFα-induced death signaling complexes in TNF α-resistant WT MEFs and TNFα-sensitive MEFs that were cFLIP-, RelA-, TRAF2- or RIP1-deficient. Consistent with TNFα-mediated killing, we detected TNFα-induced high molecular weight complexes containing caspase-8 and FADD by gel filtration in the deficient MEFs, especially in those devoid of cFLIP. In addition to the presence of caspase-8-FADD in the TNFα-induced-death complex in the deficient MEFs, we also detected an intermediate protein complex containing RIP1, TRAF2 and caspase-8. Moreover, we demonstrated a correlation between TNFα-sensitivity and death-inducing complex ability in two transformed cell lines, E1A- and Ras- transformed MEFs and PDGF-B-transformed NIH-3T3 cells with PDGF-B signaling inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571. Taken together, our results suggest the involvement of cFLIP-, RelA-, RIP1-, or TRAF2-related mechanisms for preventing FADD-caspase-8 interaction in wild-type MEFs.

Abstract: It is unclear how bone cells at different sites detect mechanical loading and how site-specific mechanotransduction affects bone homeostasis. To differentiate the anabolic mechanical responses of mandibular cells from those of calvarial and long bone cells, we isolated osteoblasts from C57B6J mouse bones, cultured them for 1week, and subjected them to therapeutic low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS). While the expression of the marker proteins of osteoblasts and osteocytes such as alkaline phosphatase and FGF23, as well as Wnt1 and β-catenin, was equally upregulated, the expression of mandibular osteoblast messages related to bone remodeling and apoptosis differed from that of messages of other osteoblasts, in that the messages encoding the pro-remodeling protein RANKL and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were markedly upregulated from the very low baseline levels. Blockage of the PI3K and α5β1 integrin pathways showed that the mandibular osteoblast required mechanotransduction downstream of α5β1 integrin to upregulate expression of the proteins β-catenin, p-Akt, Bcl-2, and RANKL. Mandibular osteoblasts thus must be mechanically loaded to preserve their capability to promote remodeling and to insure osteoblast survival, both of which maintain intact mandibular bone tissue. In contrast, calvarial Bcl-2 is fully expressed, together with ILK and phosphorylated mTOR, in the absence of LIPUS. The antibody blocking α5β1 integrin suppressed both the baseline expression of all calvarial proteins examined and the LIPUS-induced expression of all mandibular proteins examined. These findings indicate that the cellular environment, in addition to the tridermic origin, determines site-specific bone homeostasis through the remodeling and survival of osteoblastic cells. Differentiated cells of the osteoblastic lineage at different sites transmit signals through transmembrane integrins such as α5β1 integrin in mandibular osteoblasts, whose signaling may play a major role in controlling bone homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
European and North American strains of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii belong to three distinct clonal lineages, type I, type II, and type III, which differ in virulence. Understanding the basis of Toxoplasma strain differences and how secreted effectors work to achieve chronic infection is a major goal of current research. Here we show that type I and III infected macrophages, a cell type required for host immunity to Toxoplasma, are alternatively activated, while type II infected macrophages are classically activated. The Toxoplasma rhoptry kinase ROP16, which activates STAT6, is responsible for alternative activation. The Toxoplasma dense granule protein GRA15, which activates NF-κB, promotes classical activation by type II parasites. These effectors antagonistically regulate many of the same genes, and mice infected with type II parasites expressing type I ROP16 are protected against Toxoplasma-induced ileitis. Thus, polymorphisms in determinants that modulate macrophage activation influence the ability of Toxoplasma to establish a chronic infection.

Abstract: This study reveals that it is possible to obtain a specific cell response towards low-fouling carboxymethyl dextran (CMD) surfaces bearing the RGD adhesive peptide in fibrin. To avoid cell sedimentation on surfaces observed in traditional cell culture systems, CMD surfaces bearing RGD were vertically embedded in fibrin containing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and their effect over cells was investigated. Compared to the CMD surfaces and to CMD layers bearing the negative control RGE, RGD coatings promoted cell adhesion, induced focal contact formation indicated by co-localization of vinculin and actin fibers, and presented a significant effect over HUVEC net growth during the first 24h of the culture, as revealed by Ki67 staining and cell counting. The intracellular localization of caveolin-1 combined with the expression of beta 1 integrins was investigated and the orientation of HUVEC towards and on the RGD surfaces was studied. When compared to the negative controls, HUVEC responded to the RGD surface in fibrin resulting in acceleration of morphological changes. RGD surfaces supported fibrin degradation by HUVEC as revealed by fluorescent fibrin experiments as well as multi-cellular structure formation, vacuolation and lumen formation.

Abstract: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer with a continuously growing incidence worldwide and is usually resistant to chemotherapy agents, which is due in part to a strong resistance to apoptosis. The resistance mechanisms are complex and melanoma cells may have diverse possibilities for regulating apoptosis to generate apoptotic deficiencies. In this study, we investigated the relationship between melanogenesis and resistance to apoptosis induced by ursolic acid, a natural chemopreventive agent, in B16-F0 melanoma cells. We demonstrated that cells undergoing apoptosis are able to delay their own death. It appeared that tyrosinase and TRP-1 up-regulation in apoptotic cells and the subsequent production of melanin were clearly implicated in an apoptosis resistance mechanism; while TRP-2, a well known mediator of melanoma resistance to cell death, was repressed. Our results confirm the difficulty of treating melanomas, since, even undergoing apoptosis, cells are nevertheless able to trigger a resistance mechanism to delay death.

Abstract: Summary
Pathogens adapt to the host environment by altering their patterns of gene expression. Microarray-based and genetic techniques used to characterize bacterial gene expression during infection are limited in their ability to comprehensively and simultaneously monitor genome-wide transcription. We used massively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques to quantitatively catalog the transcriptome of the cholera pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, derived from two animal models of infection. Transcripts elevated in infected rabbits and mice relative to laboratory media derive from the major known V. cholerae virulence factors and also from genes and small RNAs not previously linked to virulence. The RNA-seq data was coupled with metabolite analysis of cecal fluid from infected rabbits to yield insights into the host environment encountered by the pathogen and the mechanisms controlling pathogen gene expression. RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis of pathogens during infection produces a robust, sensitive, and accessible data set for evaluation of regulatory responses driving pathogenesis.

Abstract: CIN85 has been demonstrated to interact with a number of proteins involved in endocytosis and intracellular sorting. However, the exact functional role of CIN85 in endocytosis remains unclear. We have investigated whether CIN85 plays a role in EGF-induced EGF receptor (EGFR) internalization, as previously suggested, or whether CIN85 is rather involved in endosomal sorting of the EGFR. When over-expressing a dominant negative interfering CIN85 mutant consisting of three SH3 domains only, we found that internalization of EGF was inhibited. However, when knocking down CIN85 by RNAi, the EGF–EGFR uptake appeared similar to in control cells. Furthermore, in CIN85 depleted cells, EGF-induced ubiquitination of the EGFR was decreased, and degradation of EGF–EGFR complexes was delayed. Our data further demonstrated that depletion of CIN85 increased the recycling of EGF, suggesting that CIN85 plays a role in endosomal sorting of the ubiquitinated EGFR. Our data also demonstrated that CIN85 was constitutively associated with Hrs, and this strengthens the hypothesis of a functional role of CIN85 in endosomal EGFR sorting.

Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including collagen and growth factors, are greatly increased in tissue fibrosis and mainly secreted by fibroblasts. We previously demonstrated that muscle-derived fibroblasts from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients have a profibrotic phenotype, that includes significantly reduced expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease 3 (TIMP-3) compared to control. Since TIMP-3 induces apoptosis in various cell types, we hypothesized increased resistance of DMD fibroblasts to apoptosis. To address this, we evaluated apoptotic nuclei, caspase 3, caspase 3 substrate expression, and migration and adhesion properties of muscle-derived fibroblasts, after applying different apoptosis-inducing treatments. We found that DMD fibroblasts were less susceptible to cell death, more adhesive, and had greater tendency to migrate than control fibroblasts — findings further supported by alterations in FAK and ERK/MAPK expression. Resistance to apoptosis and greater adhesion are likely to contribute to muscle fibrosis so a pharmacological treatment that targets dysregulated pathways involved in cell detachment apoptosis (anoikis) may limit the progressive fibrotic remodeling characteristic of DMD.

Abstract: Summary
Several pathogenic bacteria utilize type III secretion systems (TTSS) to deliver into host cells bacterial virulence proteins with the capacity to modulate a variety of cellular pathways. Once delivered into host cells, the accurate targeting of bacterial effectors to specific locations is critical for their proper function. However, little is known about the mechanisms these virulence effectors use to reach their subcellular destination. Here we show that the Salmonella TTSS effector proteins SspH2 and SseI are localized to the plasma membrane of host cells, a process dependent on S-palmitoylation of a conserved cysteine residue within their N-terminal domains. We also show that effector protein lipidation is mediated by a specific subset of host-cell palmitoyltransferases and that lipidation is critical for effector function. This study describes a remarkable mechanism by which a pathogen exploits host-cell machinery to properly target its virulence factors.

Abstract: Summary
Salmonella stimulates host cell invasion using virulence effectors translocated by the pathogen's type-three secretion system (T3SS). These factors manipulate host signaling pathways, primarily driven by Rho family GTPases, which culminates in Arp2/3 complex-dependent activation of host actin nucleation to mediate the uptake of Salmonella into host cells. However, recent data argue for the existence of additional mechanisms that cooperate in T3SS-dependent Salmonella invasion. We identify a myosin II-mediated mechanism, operating independent of but complementary to the Arp2/3-dependent pathway, as contributing to Salmonella invasion into nonphagocytic cells. We also establish that the T3SS effector SopB constitutes an important regulator of this Rho/Rho kinase and myosin II-dependent invasion pathway. Thus, Salmonella enters nonphagocytic cells by manipulating the two core machineries of actin-based motility in the host: Arp2/3 complex-driven actin polymerization and actomyosin-mediated contractility.

Abstract: Effective numerical expansion of dopaminergic precursors might overcome the limited availability of transplantable cells in replacement strategies for Parkinson's disease. Here we investigated the effect of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) and FGF8 on expansion and dopaminergic differentiation of rat embryonic ventral mesencephalic neuroblasts cultured at high (20%) and low (3%) oxygen tension. More cells incorporated bromodeoxyuridine in cultures expanded at low as compared to high oxygen tension, and after 6days of differentiation there were significantly more neuronal cells in low than in high oxygen cultures. Low oxygen during FGF2-mediated expansion resulted also in a significant increase in tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-ir) dopaminergic neurons as compared to high oxygen tension, but no corresponding effect was observed for dopamine release into the culture medium. However, switching FGF2-expanded cultures from low to high oxygen tension during the last two days of differentiation significantly enhanced dopamine release and intracellular dopamine levels as compared to all other treatment groups. In addition, the short-term exposure to high oxygen enhanced in situ assessed TH enzyme activity, which may explain the elevated dopamine levels. Our findings demonstrate that modulation of oxygen tension is a recognizable factor for in vitro expansion and dopaminergic differentiation of rat embryonic midbrain precursor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Viral particle binding to plasma membrane receptors elicits virus motions, recruits signaling proteins, and triggers membrane bending and fission, finally resulting in endocytic virus uptake. Here we analyze how human adenovirus engages its receptor coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (CAR) and coreceptor αv integrin to move on the plasma membrane. Virus binding to CAR through fiber knobs gave rise to diffusive motions and actomyosin-2-dependent drifts, while integrin-targeted viruses were spatially more confined. Diffusions, drifts, and confined motions were specifically observed with viral particles that were subsequently internalized. CAR-mediated drifts together with integrin binding supported fiber shedding from adenovirus particles, leading to exposure of the membrane-lytic internal virion protein VI and enhanced viral escape from endosomes. Our results show that adenovirus uncoating is initiated at the plasma membrane by CAR drifting motion and binding to immobile integrins.

Abstract: Variants of unknown significance (VUS) complicate the assignment of risk to new DNA sequence variants found in at-risk populations. This study focused on the poorly studied linker region of the cancer-associated BRCA2 protein encoded by exons twelve through fourteen of BRCA2. To develop a new method to characterize VUS in this region of BRCA2, we first chose to study 4 reported VUS occurring on evolutionarily conserved residues within the linker region. To determine if these VUS represent neutral changes or if they impact the function of the BRCA2 protein, we stably transfected expression plasmids encoding wild-type or each mutant peptide into T47D breast cancer cells, which are wild-type for BRCA2. Four mutant peptide expressing cell lines and a wild-type linker region expressing cell line next were studied by challenging transfected cell lines with the DNA crosslinking compound cisplatin (10μM) for 5days. Expression of the wild-type linker region and certain mutant linker peptides (N2452D and I2285V) decreased apoptosis (as demonstrated by cell death detection assay) in transfected cell lines, indicating that the linker region peptide directly or indirectly affects the DNA damage repair pathway. By determining the cell survival and assaying the apoptotic index of treated cell lines, one could potentially use this screen to determine that a particular VUS has a functional impact on BRCA2 function, and hence is of functional significance. We conclude that this method is useful for screening the effect of linker region VUS on BRCA2 function, and to identify mutations for further testing. We also conclude that mutations in the linker region may have heretofore unappreciated roles in BRCA2 function.

Abstract: The majority of breast cancer cases ultimately become unresponsive to endocrine therapies, and this progression of breast cancer from hormone-responsive to hormone-independent represents an area in need of further research. Additionally, hormone-independent carcinomas are characterized as being more aggressive and metastatic, key features of more advanced disease. Having previously shown the ability of the stromal-cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1)–CXCR4 signaling axis to promote primary tumorigenesis and hormone independence by overexpressing CXCR4 in MCF-7 cells, in this study we further examined the role of SDF-1/CXCR4 in the endogenously CXCR4-positive, estrogen receptor α (ER-α)-positive breast carcinoma cell line, MDA–MB-361. In addition to regulating estrogen-induced and hormone-independent tumor growth, CXCR4 signaling stimulated the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, evidenced by decreased CDH1 expression following SDF-1 treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of CXCR4 with the small molecule inhibitor AMD3100 induced CDH1 gene expression and inhibited CDH2 gene expression in MDA–MB-361 cells. Further, exogenous SDF-1 treatment induced ER-α-phosphorylation in both MDA–MB-361 and MCF-7–CXCR4 cells, demonstrating ligand-independent activation of ER-α through CXCR4 crosstalk. qPCR microRNA array analyses of the MDA–MB-361 and MCF-7–CXCR4 cell lines revealed changes in microRNA expression profiles induced by SDF-1, consistent with a more advanced disease phenotype and further supporting our hypothesis that the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling axis drives ER-α-positive breast cancer cells to a hormone independent and more aggressive phenotype. In this first demonstration of SDF-1–CXCR4-induced microRNAs in breast cancer, we suggest that this signaling axis may promote tumorigenesis via microRNA regulation. These findings represent future potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of hormone-independent and endocrine-resistant breast cancer.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are known to protect cells from several stressors. Nucleotide changes in the flanking regions [5′- and 3′-untranslated region (UTR)] of Hsp gene might affect inducibility, degree of expression, or stability of Hsp70 mRNA. The present study aimed to investigate the association between inducible Hsp70.1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and heat shock (HS) response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in dairy cows. Four hundred forty-six Italian Holstein cows were genotyped for four Hsp70.1 SNPs: g895 C/- and g1128 G/T in 5′-UTR, and g2154 G/A and g64 G/T in 3′-UTR. Genetic polymorphisms in 3′-UTR of bovine Hsp70.1 gene resulted monomorphic. Distribution of alleles of the nucleotide sequence polymorphism within the 5′-UTR of the bovine Hsp70.1 gene were 81.2% and 18.8% for C and -, respectively, and 77.8% and 22.2% for G and T, respectively. Among the 446 genotyped animals, a group of cows balanced for days in milk and parity was selected to be representative of the following genotypes: CC (n = 8), C- (n = 7), and -- (n = 7) and GG (n = 8), GT (n = 11), and TT (n = 3) in 5′-UTR. PBMC were isolated from blood samples and heated at 43°C in thermal bath for 1 h and then incubated at 39°C in atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h (recovery times). Cell viability was determined by XTT assay. Gene and protein expression of Hsp70.1 was determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and by ELISA assay, respectively. For the two SNPs detected, one allele was the most frequent (C, 66.8% and G, 56.8%). Genotypes -- and TG showed higher (P < 0.05) viability compared with CC and GG, respectively. Genotypes C- and TT had intermediate viability. Gene expression of Hsp70.1 showed higher (P < 0.001) levels in -- and TG genotype compared with their counterparts. Genotypes -- and TG showed the higher level of inducible Hsp70.1 protein in respect to C-, TT and CC, GG. In conclusion, exposure to HS differently affected cell viability and gene and protein expression of Hsp70.1 in the selected genotypes. These results indicate that the presence of SNPs (C/- and G/T) in the 5′-UTR region of inducible Hsp70.1 ameliorates HS response and tolerance to heat of bovine PBMC. These mutation sites may be useful as molecular genetic markers to assist selection for heat tolerance.

Abstract: The α9β1 integrin is a multifunctional receptor that interacts with a variety of ligands including vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, tenascin-C, and osteopontin. A 2.3-kb truncated form of α9 integrin subunit cDNA was identified by searching the Medline database. This splice variant, which we called the short form of α9 integrin (SFα9), encodes a 632-aa isoform lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and its authentic expression was verified by PCR and Western blotting. SFα9 is expressed on the cell surface but cannot bind ligand in the absence of the full-length α9 subunit. Over-expression of SFα9 in cells expressing full-length α9 promotes α9-dependent cell adhesion. This promoting effect of SFα9 requires the authentic cytoplasmic domain of the co-expressed full-length α9 subunit. Thus, SFα9 is a novel functional modulator of α9β1 integrin by inside-out signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Leishmania parasites infect macrophages, cells normally involved in innate defense against pathogens. Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major cause severe or mild disease, respectively, consistent with each parasite's ability to survive within activated macrophages. The mechanisms underlying increased virulence of L. amazonensis are mostly unknown. We show that L. amazonensis promotes its own survival by inducing expression of CD200, an immunoregulatory molecule that inhibits macrophage activation. L. amazonensis does not form typical nonhealing lesions in CD200−/− mice and cannot replicate in CD200−/− macrophages, an effect reversed by exogenous administration of soluble CD200-Fc. The less virulent L. major does not induce CD200 expression and forms small, self-healing lesions in both wild-type and CD200−/− mice. Notably, CD200-Fc injection transforms the course of L. major infection to one resembling L. amazonensis, with large, nonhealing lesions. CD200-dependent iNOS inhibition allows parasite growth in macrophages, identifying a mechanism for the increased virulence of L. amazonensis.

Abstract: Alexander disease is a primary genetic disorder of astrocyte caused by dominant mutations in the astrocyte-specific intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). While most of the disease-causing mutations described to date have been found in the conserved α-helical rod domain, some mutations are found in the C-terminal non-α-helical tail domain. Here, we compare five different mutations (N386I, S393I, S398F, S398Y and D417M14X) located in the C-terminal domain of GFAP on filament assembly properties in vitro and in transiently transfected cultured cells. All the mutations disrupted in vitro filament assembly. The mutations also affected the solubility and promoted filament aggregation of GFAP in transiently transfected MCF7, SW13 and U343MG cells. This correlated with the activation of the p38 stress-activated protein kinase and an increased association with the small heat shock protein (sHSP) chaperone, αB-crystallin. Of the mutants studied, D417M14X GFAP caused the most significant effects both upon filament assembly in vitro and in transiently transfected cells. This mutant also caused extensive filament aggregation coinciding with the sequestration of αB-crystallin and HSP27 as well as inhibition of the proteosome and activation of p38 kinase. Associated with these changes were an activation of caspase 3 and a significant decrease in astrocyte viability. We conclude that some mutations in the C-terminus of GFAP correlate with caspase 3 cleavage and the loss of cell viability, suggesting that these could be contributory factors in the development of Alexander disease.

Abstract: In mammals, the existence of cytosine methylation on non-CpG sequences is controversial. Here, we adapted a LuminoMetric-based Assay (LUMA) to determine global non-CpG methylation levels in rodent and human tissues. We observed that <1% cytosines in non-CpG motifs were methylated in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, whereas 7–13% cytosines in non-CpG motifs were methylated in mouse tissues or embryonic fibroblasts. Analysis of cytosine methylation in human, rat, and mouse tissues by bisulfite sequencing revealed non-CpG methylation levels up to 7.5% of all non-CpG cytosines. These levels dropped to 1.5% when a second round of PCR was performed prior to bisulfite sequencing, providing an explanation for the common underestimation of non-CpG methylation levels. Collectively, our results provide evidence that non-CpG methylation exists at substantial levels in mammals.

Abstract: Ku70 and Ku80 play an essential role in the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway, i.e., nonhomologous DNA-end-joining (NHEJ). No accumulation mechanisms of Ku70 at DSBs have been clarified in detail, although the accumulation mechanism of Ku70 at DSBs plays key roles in regulating the NHEJ activity. Here, we show the essential domains for the accumulation and function of Ku70 at DSBs in living lung epithelial cells. Our results showed that EGFP-Ku70 accumulation at DSBs began immediately after irradiation. Our findings demonstrate that three domains of Ku70, i.e., the α/β, DNA-binding, and Ku80-binding domains, but not the SAP domain, are necessary for the accumulation at or recognition of DSBs in the early stage after irradiation. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the leucine at amino acid 385 of Ku70 in the Ku80-binding domain, but not the three target amino acids for acetylation in the DNA-binding domain, is involved in the localization and accumulation of Ku70 at DSBs. Furthermore, accumulations of XRCC4 and XLF, but not that of Artemis, at DSBs are dependent on the presence of Ku70. These findings suggest that Artemis can work in not only the Ku-dependent repair process, but also the Ku-independent process at DSBs in living epithelial cells.

Abstract: TRAIL resistance in many cancer cells is one of the major problems in TRAIL-based cancer therapy. Thus, the agents that can sensitize the tumor cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis are strictly needed for the improvement of anti-cancer effect of TRAIL. Acrolein is a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, which has been involved in pulmonary, cardiac and neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated whether acrolein, an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, can potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human renal cancer cells. The combined treatment with acrolein and TRAIL significantly induced apoptosis, and stimulated of caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation, and cleavage of PARP. We found that acrolein down-regulated the protein level of Bcl-2 and Bcl-2 overexpression inhibited the cell death induced by the combined treatment with acrolein and TRAIL. In addition, acrolein up-regulated C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and TRAIL death receptor 5 (DR5) and down-regulation of CHOP or DR5 expression using the respective small interfering RNA significantly attenuated the apoptosis induced by acrolein plus TRAIL. Interestingly, pretreatment with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), inhibited not only CHOP and DR5 up-regulation but also the cell death induced by acrolein plus TRAIL. Taken together, our results demonstrated that acrolein enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Caki cells through down-regulation of Bcl-2 and ROS dependent up-regulation of DR5.

Abstract: Hypoxia has been shown to be one of the major events involved in EPO expression. Accordingly, EPO might be expressed by cerebral neoplastic cells, especially in glioblastoma, known to be highly hypoxic tumours. The expression of EPOR has been described in glioma cells. However, data from the literature remain descriptive and controversial. On the basis of an endogenous source of EPO in the brain, we have focused on a potential role of EPOR in brain tumour growth. In the present study, with complementary approaches to target EPO/EPOR signalling, we demonstrate the presence of a functional EPO/EPOR system on glioma cells leading to the activation of the ERK pathway. This EPO/EPOR system is involved in glioma cell proliferation in vitro. In vivo, we show that the down-regulation of EPOR expression on glioma cells reduces tumour growth and enhances animal survival. Our results support the hypothesis that EPOR signalling in tumour cells is involved in the control of glioma growth.

Abstract: Co-ordination of cytoskeletal networks and their dynamics is an essential feature of cell migration and cancer cell invasion. Plectin is a large cytolinker protein that influences tissue integrity, organisation of actin and intermediate filaments, and cell migration. Alternatively spliced plectin isoforms are targeted to different subcellular locations. Here, we show that plectin ablation by siRNA impaired migration, invasion and adhesion of SW480 colon carcinoma cells. A previously less well characterised plectin isoform, plectin-1k, co-localised with epithelial integrins, N-WASP, cortactin, and dynamin in podosome-like adhesions in invasive SW480 colon carcinoma cells. Transfection of alternative plectin N-terminal constructs demonstrated that the first exons of isoforms 1k, 1 and 1d can target the actin-binding domain of plectin to podosome-like adhesions. Finally, Plectin-1k N-terminus rescued adhesion site formation in plectin knock-down cells. Thus, plectin participates in actin assembly and invasiveness in carcinoma cells in an isoform-specific manner.

Abstract: Summary
Sleeping sickness is characterized by waves of the extracellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei in host blood, with infections continuing for months or years until inevitable host death. These waves reflect the dynamic conflict between the outgrowth of a succession of parasite antigenic variants and their control by the host immune system. Although a contributor to these dynamics is the density-dependent differentiation from proliferative “slender forms” to transmissible “stumpy forms,” an absence of markers discriminating stumpy forms has prevented accurate parameterization of this component. Here, we exploit the stumpy-specific PAD1 marker, which functionally defines transmission competence, to quantitatively monitor stumpy formation during chronic infections. This allows reconstruction of the temporal events early in infection. Mathematical modeling of these data describes the parameters controlling trypanosome within-host dynamics and provides strong support for a quorum-sensing-like mechanism. Our data reveal the dominance of transmission stages throughout infection, a consequence being austere use of the parasite's antigen repertoire.

Abstract: We have previously demonstrated that CD34+ cells isolated from fetal mouse muscles are an interesting source of myogenic progenitors. In the present work, we pinpoint the tissue location of these CD34+ cells using cell surface and phenotype markers. In order to identify the myogenic population, we next purified different CD34+ subsets, determined their expression of relevant lineage-related genes, and analyzed their differentiation capacities in vitro and in vivo. The CD34+ population comprised a CD31+/CD45− cell subset exhibiting endothelial characteristics and only capable of forming microvessels in vivo. The CD34+/CD31−/CD45−/Sca1+ subpopulation, which is restricted to the muscle epimysium, displayed adipogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. CD34+/CD31−/CD45−/Sca1− cells, localized in the muscle interstitium, transcribed myogenic genes, but did not display the characteristics of adult satellite cells. These cells were distinct from pericytes and fibroblasts. They were myogenic in vitro, and efficiently contributed to skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo, although their myogenic potential was lower than that of the unfractionated CD34+ cell population. Our results indicate that angiogenic and adipogenic cells grafted with myogenic cells enhance their contribution to myogenic regeneration, highlighting the fundamental role of the microenvironment on the fate of transplanted cells.

Abstract: Lamins A and C are nuclear intermediate filament proteins expressed in most differentiated somatic cells. Previous data suggested that prelamin A, the lamin A precursor, accumulates in some lipodystrophy syndromes caused by mutations in the lamin A/C gene, and binds and inactivates the sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1). Here we show that, in vitro, the tail regions of prelamin A, lamin A and lamin C bind a polypeptide of SREBP1. Such interactions also occur in HeLa cells, since expression of lamin tail regions impedes nucleolar accumulation of the SREBP1 polypeptide fused to a nucleolar localization signal sequence. In addition, the tail regions of A-type lamin variants that occur in Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy of (R482W) and Hutchison Gilford progeria syndrome (∆607–656) bind to the SREBP1 polypeptide in vitro, and the corresponding FLAG-tagged full-length lamin variants co-immunoprecipitate the SREBP1 polypeptide in cells. Overexpression of wild-type A-type lamins and variants favors SREBP1 polypeptide localization at the intranuclear periphery, suggesting its sequestration. Our data support the hypothesis that variation of A-type lamin protein level and spatial organization, in particular due to disease-linked mutations, influences the sequestration of SREBP1 at the nuclear envelope and thus contributes to the regulation of SREBP1 function.

Abstract: The present studies aimed to understand the interrelationships between stress, hormones and heat shock proteins (HSPs) in the ovary. We examined (1) whether HSP70.2, HSP72 and HSP105/110 can be produced and accumulated in porcine ovarian tissue, (2) whether these HSPs could be indicators of stress, i.e. whether two kinds of stress (high temperatures and malnutrition/serum deprivation) can affect them, and (3) whether some hormonal regulators of ovarian functions (insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, leptin and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)) can affect these HSPs and response of ovaries to HSP-related stress. We analysed the expression of HSP70.2, HSP72 and HSP105/110 mRNA (by using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) in porcine ovarian granulosa cells, as well as the accumulation of HSP70 protein (by using sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis–Western) in either whole ovarian follicles and granulose cells cultured at normal (37.5°C) or high (41.5°C) temperature, with and without serum and with and without IGF-I, leptin and FSH. Expression of mRNA for HSP70.2, HSP72 and HSP105/110 in ovarian granulosa cells and accumulation of HSP70 protein in whole ovarian follicles and granulosa cells were demonstrated. In all the groups, addition of either IGF-I, leptin and FSH reduced the expression of HSP70.2, HSP72 and HSP105/110 mRNA. Both high temperature, serum deprivation and their combination resulted in increase in mRNAs for all three analysed HSPs. Additions of either IGF-I, leptin and FSH prevented the stimulatory effect of both high temperature and serum deprivation on the transcription of HSP70.2, HSP72 and HSP105/110. In contrast, high temperature reduced accumulation of peptide HSP70 in both ovarian follicles and granulosa cell. Serum deprivation promoted accumulation of HSP70 in granulosa cells, but not in ovarian follicles. Addition of IGF-I, leptin and FSH was able to alter accumulation of HSP70 in both follicles and granulosa cells. The present observations suggest (1) that HSPs can be synthesised in ovarian follicular granulosa cells; (2) that hormones (IGF-I, leptin and FSH) can inhibit, whilst stressors (both high temperature and malnutrition/serum deprivation) can stimulate transcription of HSP70.2, HSP72 and HSP105/110 genes, whilst heat stress, but not malnutrition, can promote depletion of HSP70 in ovarian cells, and (3) that hormones (IGF-I, leptin and FSH) can prevent stress-related changes in HSPs. The application of HSPs as indicators and mediators of stress and hormones on ovarian functions, as well as use of hormones and HSPs as anti-stressor molecules, are discussed.

Abstract: Glucagon levels are elevated in diabetes and some liver diseases. Increased glucagon secretion leads to abnormal stimulation of glucagon receptors (GRs) and consequent elevated glucose production in the liver. Blocking glucagon receptor signaling has been proposed as a potential treatment option for diabetes and other conditions associated with hyperglycemia. Elucidating mechanisms of GR desensitization and downregulation may help identify new drug targets besides GR itself. The present study explores the mechanisms of GR internalization and the role of PKCα, GPCR kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins therein. We have reported previously that PKCα mediates GR phosphorylation and desensitization. While the PKC agonist, PMA, did not affect GR internalization when tested alone, it increased glucagon-mediated GR internalization by 25–40% in GR-expressing HEK-293 cells (HEK-GR cells). In both primary hepatocytes and HEK-GR cells, glucagon treatment recruited PKCα to the plasma membrane where it colocalized with GR. We also observed that overexpression of GRK2, GRK3, or GRK5 enhanced GR internalization. In addition, we found that GR utilizes both clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis in HEK-GR cells. Glucagon triggered translocation of both β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 from the cytosol to the perimembrane region, and overexpression of β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 increased GR internalization. Furthermore, both β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 colocalized with GR and with Cav-1, suggesting the possible involvement of these arrestins in GR internalization.

Abstract: c-Abl tyrosine kinase, which is ubiquitously expressed, has three nuclear localization signals and one nuclear export signal and can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. c-Abl plays important roles in cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis. Recently, we developed a pixel imaging method for quantitating the level of chromatin structural changes and showed that nuclear Src-family tyrosine kinases are involved in chromatin structural changes upon growth factor stimulation. Using this method, we show here that nuclear c-Abl induces chromatin structural changes in a manner dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity. Expression of nuclear-targeted c-Abl drastically increases the levels of chromatin structural changes, compared with that of c-Abl. Intriguingly, nuclear-targeted c-Abl induces heterochromatic profiles of histone methylation and acetylation, including hypoacetylation of histone H4 acetylated on lysine 16 (H4K16Ac). The level of heterochromatic histone modifications correlates with that of chromatin structural changes. Adriamycin-induced DNA damage stimulates translocation of c-Abl into the nucleus and induces chromatin structural changes together with H4K16 hypoacetylation. Treatment with trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, blocks chromatin structural changes but not nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation by c-Abl. These results suggest that nuclear c-Abl plays an important role in chromatin dynamics through nuclear tyrosine phosphorylation-induced heterochromatic histone modifications.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins such as gp96 are immunogenic and are widely used as vaccines in immunotherapy of cancers. The present study focuses on the use of peptide mimotopes as immunotherapeutic vaccines for prostate cancer. To this end, we developed a 15-mer gp96 peptide mimotope specifically reactive to MAT-LyLu gp96–peptide complex using combinatorial single-chain antibody and peptide phage display library. The immunogenicity of the synthesized gp96 mimotope was analyzed initially in normal BALB/c mice in combination with various adjuvants such as complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), aluminum salts (ALUM), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and liposome, of which CFA served as a positive control. The antibody response was determined and found that the gp96 mimotope with ALUM showed a significant increase in antibody titer, followed by GM-CSF and liposomes. Further, the T cell (CD4+ and CD8+) populations from splenocytes, as well as IgG isotypes, interleukin-4, and interleukin-5 of gp96 mimotope with ALUM-immunized animals, were analyzed. The results suggest that the gp96 mimotope may elicit a potent and effective antitumor antibody response. Further, the study identifies ALUM and GM-CSF as adjuvant options to drive an appropriate protective immune response as these adjuvants have prior use in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Alphaviruses, including several emerging human pathogens, are a large family of mosquito-borne viruses with Sindbis virus being a prototypical member of the genus. The host factor requirements and receptors for entry of this class of viruses remain obscure. Using a Drosophila system, we identified the divalent metal ion transporter natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP) as a host cell surface molecule required for Sindbis virus binding and entry into Drosophila cells. Consequently, flies mutant for dNRAMP were protected from virus infection. NRAMP2, the ubiquitously expressed vertebrate homolog, mediated binding and infection of Sindbis virus into mammalian cells, and murine cells deficient for NRAMP2 were nonpermissive to infection. Alphavirus glycoprotein chimeras demonstrated that the requirement for NRAMP2 is at the level of Sindbis virus entry. Given the conserved structure of alphavirus glycoproteins, and the widespread use of transporters for viral entry, other alphaviruses may use conserved multipass membrane proteins for infection.

Abstract: The LAMMER kinases are conserved through evolution. They play vital roles in cell growth/differentiation, development, and metabolism. One of the best known functions of the kinases in animal cells is the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Kic1 is the LAMMER kinase in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Despite the reported pleiotropic effects of kic1+ deletion/overexpression on various cellular processes the involvement of Kic1 in splicing remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that Kic1 not only is required for efficient splicing but also affects mRNA export, providing evidence for the conserved roles of LAMMER kinases in the unicellular context of fission yeast. Consistent with the hypothesis of its direct participation in multiple steps of pre-mRNA processing, Kic1 is predominantly present in the nucleus during interphase. In addition, the kinase activity of Kic1 plays a role in modulating its own cellular partitioning. Interestingly, Kic1 expression oscillates in a cell cycle-dependent manner and the peak level coincides with mitosis and cytokinesis, revealing a potential mechanism for controlling the kinase activity during the cell cycle. The novel information about the in vivo functions and regulation of Kic1 offers insights into the conserved biological roles fundamental to LAMMER kinases in eukaryotes.

Abstract: Activation and migration of resident stellate cells (HSCs) within the hepatic space of Disse play an important role in hepatic fibrosis, which accounts for the increased numbers of activated HSCs in areas of inflammation during hepatic fibrosis. Currently, microRNAs have been found to play essential roles in HSC differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, fat accumulation and collagen production. However, little is known about microRNA mediated HSC activation and migration. In this study, the miRNA expression profiles of quiescent HSCs, partially activated HSCs and fully activated HSCs were compared in pairs. Gene ontology (GO) and GO-Map network analysis indicated that the activation of HSCs was regulated by microRNAs. Among them miR-335 was confirmed to be significantly reduced during HSC activation by qRT-PCR, and restoring expression of miR-335 inhibited HSC migration and reduced α-SMA and collagen type I. Previous study revealed that tenascin-C (TNC), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein involved in cell migration, might be a target of miR-335. Therefore, we further studied the TNC expression in miR-335 over-expressed HSCs. Our data showed that exogenous TNC could enhance HSC migration in vitro and miR-335 restoration resulted in a significant inhibition of TNC expression. These results demonstrated that miR-335 restoration inhibited HSC migration, at least in part, via downregulating the TNC expression.

Abstract: Stem cell therapy is a promising tool to improve outcome after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but needs to be optimized since results from clinical applications remain ambiguous. A potent source of stem cells is the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue (SVF), which contains high numbers of adipose derived stem cells (ASC). We hypothesized that: 1) intravenous injection can be used to apply stem cells to the heart. 2) Uncultured SVF cells are easier and safer when cultured ASCs. 3) Transplantation after the acute inflammation period of AMI is favorable over early injection. For this, AMI was induced in rats by 40min of coronary occlusion. One or seven days after AMI, rats were intravenously injected with vehicle, 5×106 uncultured rat SVF cells or 1×106 rat ASCs. Rats were analyzed 35days after AMI. Intravenous delivery of both fresh SVF cells and cultured ASCs 7days after AMI significantly reduced infarct size compared to vehicle. Similar numbers of stem cells were found in the heart, after treatment with fresh SVF cells and cultured ASCs. Importantly, no adverse effects were found after injection of SVF cells. Using cultured ASCs, however, 3 animals had shortness of breath, and one animal died during injection. In contrast to application at 7days post AMI, injection of SVF cells 1day post AMI resulted in a small but non-significant infarct reduction (p=0.35). Taken together, intravenous injection of uncultured SVF cells subsequent to the acute inflammation period, is a promising stem cell therapy for AMI.

Abstract: SPIN90 is an F-actin binding protein thought to play important roles in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. It is known that SPIN90 is expressed during the early stages of neuronal development, but details of its localization and function in growth cones have not been fully investigated. Our immunocytochemical data show that SPIN90 is enriched throughout growth cones and neuronal shafts in young hippocampal neurons. We also found that its localization correlates with and depends upon the presence of F-actin. Detailed observation of primary cultures of hippocampal neurons revealed that SPIN90 knockout reduces both growth cone areas and in the numbers of filopodia, as compared to wild-type neurons. In addition, total neurite length, the combined lengths of the longest (axonal) and shorter (dendritic) neurites, was smaller in SPIN90 knockout neurons than wild-type neurons. Finally, Cdc42 activity was down-regulated in SPIN90 knockout neurons. Taken together, our findings suggest that SPIN90 plays critical roles in controlling growth cone dynamics and neurite outgrowth.
