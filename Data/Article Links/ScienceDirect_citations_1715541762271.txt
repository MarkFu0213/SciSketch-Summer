Abstract: Summary
During embryonic cell cycles, B-cyclin-CDKs function as the core component of an autonomous oscillator. Current models for the cell-cycle oscillator in nonembryonic cells are slightly more complex, incorporating multiple G1, S phase, and mitotic cyclin-CDK complexes. However, periodic events persist in yeast cells lacking all S phase and mitotic B-cyclin genes, challenging the assertion that cyclin-CDK complexes are essential for oscillations. These and other results led to the proposal that a network of sequentially activated transcription factors functions as an underlying cell-cycle oscillator. Here we examine the individual contributions of a transcription factor network and cyclin-CDKs to the maintenance of cell-cycle oscillations. Our findings suggest that while cyclin-CDKs are not required for oscillations, they do contribute to oscillation robustness. A model emerges in which cyclin expression (thereby, CDK activity) is entrained to an autonomous transcriptional oscillator. CDKs then modulate oscillator function and serve as effectors of the oscillator.

Abstract: Estrogen induces oocytes development and vitellogenesis in crustacean by interacting with estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes. In the present study, we detect for the first time the ERα in oocytes and follicle cells and hepatopancreas cells of mysis by immunohistochemistry using a specific ERα antibody. ERα was mainly localized in the nuclei of oocytes and follicle cells, while mainly detected in nuclei of oogonia (OG), previtellogenic oocyte (PR) and endogenous vitellogenic oocyte (EN) at previtellogenic and early vitellogenic stage (I–early III). Follicle cells in all stages of ovary (all vitellogenic stages) showed strong ERα positive reaction, and they were able to gradually move to oocytes during the development of oocytes. In addition, ERα was also localized in the nuclei and cytoplasm of four hepatopancreas cells (including E-, R-, F- and B-cell) in all ovary stages. These findings suggest, for the first time to our knowledge, that there could be a close link between oogenesis, follicle cells, hepatopancreas cells and endocrine regulation, and estrogens might be involved in the regulation of oocytes at early ovarian stage in mysis.

Abstract: Summary
During development, directional cell division is a major mechanism for establishing the orientation of tissue growth. Drosophila neuroblasts undergo asymmetric divisions perpendicular to the overlying epithelium to produce descendant neurons on the opposite side, thereby orienting initial neural tissue growth. However, the mechanism remains elusive. We provide genetic evidence that extrinsic GPCR signaling determines the orientation of cortical polarity underlying asymmetric divisions of neuroblasts relative to the epithelium. The GPCR Tre1 activates the G protein oα subunit in neuroblasts by interacting with the epithelium to recruit Pins, which regulates spindle orientation. Because Pins associates with the Par-complex via Inscuteable, Tre1 consequently recruits the polarity complex to orthogonally orient the polarity axis to the epithelium. Given the universal role of the Par complex in cellular polarization, we propose that the GPCR-Pins system is a comprehensive mechanism controlling tissue polarity by orienting polarized stem cells and their divisions.

Abstract: Summary
The prostate epithelial lineage hierarchy and the cellular origin for prostate cancer remain inadequately defined. Using a lineage-tracing approach, we show that adult rodent prostate basal and luminal cells are independently self-sustained in vivo. Disrupting the tumor suppressor Pten in either lineage led to prostate cancer initiation. However, the cellular composition and onset dynamics of the resulting tumors are distinctive. Prostate luminal cells are more responsive to Pten null-induced mitogenic signaling. In contrast, basal cells are resistant to direct transformation. Instead, loss of Pten activity induces the capability of basal cells to differentiate into transformation-competent luminal cells. Our study suggests that deregulation of epithelial differentiation is a critical step for the initiation of prostate cancers of basal cell origin.

Abstract: Summary
Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification has emerged as an important regulatory mechanism during embryonic development. However, it is not known whether SUMOylation plays a role in the development of the immune system. Here, we show that SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) is essential for the development of early T and B cells. STAT5, a key regulator of lymphoid development, is modified by SUMO-2 and is specifically regulated by SENP1. In the absence of SENP1, SUMO-2 modified STAT5 accumulates in early lymphoid precursors, resulting in a block in its acetylation and subsequent signaling. These results demonstrate a crucial role of SENP1 in the regulation of STAT5 activation during early lymphoid development.

Abstract: The molecular machinery underlying action potential-evoked, synchronous neurotransmitter release, has been intensely studied. It was presumed that two other forms of exocytosis, delayed (asynchronous) and spontaneous transmission, were mediated by the same voltage-activated Ca2+ channels (VACCs), intracellular Ca2+ sensors and vesicle pools. However, a recent explosion in the study of spontaneous and asynchronous release has shown these presumptions to be incorrect. Furthermore, the finding that different forms of synaptic transmission may mediate distinct physiological functions emphasizes the importance of identifying the mechanisms by which Ca2+ regulates spontaneous and asynchronous release. In this article, we will briefly summarize new and published data on the role of Ca2+ in regulating spontaneous and asynchronous release at a number of different synapses. We will discuss how an increase of extracellular [Ca2+] increases spontaneous and asynchronous release, show that VACCs are involved at only some synapses, and identify regulatory roles for other ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors. In particular, we will focus on two novel pathways that play important roles in the regulation of non-synchronous release at two exemplary synapses: one modulated by the Ca2+-sensing receptor and the other by transient receptor potential cation channel sub-family V member 1.

Abstract: Summary
Constitutive NF-κB activation has causative roles in adult T cell leukemia (ATL) caused by HTLV-1 and other cancers. Here, we report a pathway involving Polycomb-mediated miRNA silencing and NF-κB activation. We determine the miRNA signatures and reveal miR-31 loss in primary ATL cells. MiR-31 negatively regulates the noncanonical NF-κB pathway by targeting NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK). Loss of miR-31 therefore triggers oncogenic signaling. In ATL cells, miR-31 level is epigenetically regulated, and aberrant upregulation of Polycomb proteins contribute to miR-31 downregulation in an epigenetic fashion, leading to activation of NF-κB and apoptosis resistance. Furthermore, this emerging circuit operates in other cancers and receptor-initiated NF-κB cascade. Our findings provide a perspective involving the epigenetic program, inflammatory responses, and oncogenic signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophil recruitment to inflammation sites purportedly depends on sequential waves of chemoattractants. Current models propose that leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a secondary chemoattractant secreted by neutrophils in response to primary chemoattractants such as formyl peptides, is important in initiating the inflammation process. In this study we demonstrate that LTB4 plays a central role in neutrophil activation and migration to formyl peptides. We show that LTB4 production dramatically amplifies formyl peptide-mediated neutrophil polarization and chemotaxis by regulating specific signaling pathways acting upstream of actin polymerization and MyoII phosphorylation. Importantly, by analyzing the migration of neutrophils isolated from wild-type mice and mice lacking the formyl peptide receptor 1, we demonstrate that LTB4 acts as a signal to relay information from cell to cell over long distances. Together, our findings imply that LTB4 is a signal-relay molecule that exquisitely regulates neutrophil chemotaxis to formyl peptides, which are produced at the core of inflammation sites.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 and the cytosolic E3 ligase Parkin can cause Parkinson's disease. Damaged mitochondria accumulate PINK1 on the outer membrane where, dependent on kinase activity, it recruits and activates Parkin to induce mitophagy, potentially maintaining organelle fidelity. How PINK1 recruits Parkin is unknown. We show that endogenous PINK1 forms a 700 kDa complex with the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) selectively on depolarized mitochondria whereas PINK1 ectopically targeted to the outer membrane retains association with TOM on polarized mitochondria. Inducibly targeting PINK1 to peroxisomes or lysosomes, which lack a TOM complex, recruits Parkin and activates ubiquitin ligase activity on the respective organelles. Once there, Parkin induces organelle selective autophagy of peroxisomes but not lysosomes. We propose that the association of PINK1 with the TOM complex allows rapid reimport of PINK1 to rescue repolarized mitochondria from mitophagy, and discount mitochondrial-specific factors for Parkin translocation and activation.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to debilitating cognitive deficits. Recent evidence demonstrates that glutamate receptors are dysregulated by amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) oligomers, resulting in disruption of glutamatergic synaptic transmission which parallels early cognitive deficits. Although it is well accepted that neuronal death in AD is related to disturbed intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) homeostasis, little is known about the contribution of NMDARs containing GluN2A or GluN2B subunits on Aβ-induced Ca2+i rise and neuronal dysfunction. Thus, the main goal of this work was to evaluate the role of NMDAR subunits in dysregulation of Ca2+i homeostasis induced by Aβ 1–42 preparation containing both oligomers (in higher percentage) and monomers in rat cerebral cortical neurons. The involvement of NMDARs was evaluated by pharmacological inhibition with MK-801 or the selective GluN2A and GLUN2B subunit antagonists NVP-AAM077 and ifenprodil, respectively. We show that Aβ, like NMDA, increase Ca2+i levels mainly through activation of NMDARs containing GluN2B subunits. Conversely, GluN2A-NMDARs antagonism potentiates Ca2+i rise induced by a high concentration of Aβ (1μM), suggesting that GluN2A and GluN2B subunits have opposite roles in regulating Ca2+i homeostasis. Moreover, Aβ modulate NMDA-induced responses and vice versa. Indeed, pre-exposure to Aβ (1μM) decrease NMDA-evoked Ca2+I rise and pre-exposure to NMDA decrease Aβ response. Interestingly, simultaneous addition of Aβ and NMDA potentiate Ca2+I levels, this effect being regulated by GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in opposite manners. This study contributes to the understanding of the molecular basis of early AD pathogenesis, by exploring the role of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in the mechanism of Aβ toxicity in AD.

Abstract: Summary
The association of type 2 diabetes with elevated plasma triglyceride (TG) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and intrahepatic lipid accumulation represents a pathophysiological enigma and an unmet therapeutic challenge. Here, we uncover a link between insulin action through FoxO1, bile acid (BA) composition, and altered lipid homeostasis that brings new insight to this longstanding conundrum. FoxO1 ablation brings about two signature lipid abnormalities of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, elevated liver and plasma TG. These changes are associated with deficiency of 12α-hydroxylated BAs and their synthetic enzyme, Cyp8b1, that hinders the TG-lowering effects of the BA receptor, Fxr. Accordingly, pharmacological activation of Fxr with GW4064 overcomes the BA imbalance, restoring hepatic and plasma TG levels of FoxO1-deficient mice to normal levels. We propose that generation of 12α-hydroxylated products of BA metabolism represents a signaling mechanism linking hepatic lipid abnormalities with type 2 diabetes, and a treatment target for this condition.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factor recruitment to genomic sites of action is primarily due to direct protein:DNA interactions. The subsequent recruitment of coregulatory complexes leads to either transcriptional activation or repression. In contrast to this canonical scheme, some transcription factors, such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), behave as transcriptional repressors when recruited to target genes through protein tethering. We have investigated the genome-wide prevalence of tethering between GR and Stat3 and found nonreciprocal interactions, namely that GR tethering to DNA-bound Stat3 results in transcriptional repression, whereas Stat3 tethering to GR results in synergism. Further, other schemes of GR and Stat3 corecruitment to regulatory modules result in transcriptional synergism, including neighboring and composite binding sites. The results indicate extensive transcriptional interactions between Stat3 and GR; further, they provide a genome-wide assessment of transcriptional regulation by tethering and a molecular basis for integration of signals mediated by GR and Stats in health and disease.

Abstract: Regulated exocytosis is a process that strongly depends on the formation and stability of the fusion pore. It was indicated experimentally and theoretically that narrow and highly curved fusion pore may be stabilized by accumulation of anisotropic membrane components possessing orientational ordering. On the other hand, narrow fusion pore may also undergo repetitive opening and closing, disruption in the so called kiss and run process or become completely opened in the process of full fusion of the vesicle with the membrane. In this paper we attempt to elucidate the subtle interplay between the stabilizing and destabilizing processes in the fusion neck. A possible physical mechanism which may lead to disruption of the stable fusion pore or complete fusion of the vesicle with the membrane is discussed. It is indicated that topologically driven defects of the in-plane orientational membrane ordering in the region of the fusion pore may disrupt the fusion. Alternatively, it may facilitate repetitive opening and closing of the fusion pore or induce full fusion of the vesicle with the target membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Immune cells are somewhat unique in that activation responses can alter quantitative phenotypes upwards of 100,000-fold. To date little is known about the metabolic adaptations necessary to mount such dramatic phenotypic shifts. Screening for novel regulators of macrophage activation, we found nonprotein kinases of glucose metabolism among the most enriched classes of candidate immune modulators. We find that one of these, the carbohydrate kinase-like protein CARKL, is rapidly downregulated in vitro and in vivo upon LPS stimulation in both mice and humans. Interestingly, CARKL catalyzes an orphan reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway, refocusing cellular metabolism to a high-redox state upon physiological or artificial downregulation. We find that CARKL-dependent metabolic reprogramming is required for proper M1- and M2-like macrophage polarization and uncover a rate-limiting requirement for appropriate glucose flux in macrophage polarization.

Abstract: Summary
Germline mutations in LKB1 (STK11) are associated with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which includes aberrant mucocutaneous pigmentation, and somatic LKB1 mutations occur in 10% of cutaneous melanoma. By somatically inactivating Lkb1 with K-Ras activation (±p53 loss) in murine melanocytes, we observed variably pigmented and highly metastatic melanoma with 100% penetrance. LKB1 deficiency resulted in increased phosphorylation of the SRC family kinase (SFK) YES, increased expression of WNT target genes, and expansion of a CD24+ cell population, which showed increased metastatic behavior in vitro and in vivo relative to isogenic CD24− cells. These results suggest that LKB1 inactivation in the context of RAS activation facilitates metastasis by inducing an SFK-dependent expansion of a prometastatic, CD24+ tumor subpopulation.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway controls tissue growth and organ size in species ranging from Drosophila to mammals and is deregulated in a wide range of human cancers. The core pathway consists of the Hpo/Warts (Wts) kinase cassette that phosphorylates and inactivates the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Here, we report that Echinoid (Ed), an immunoglobulin domain-containing cell adhesion molecule, acts as an upstream regulator of the Hpo pathway. Loss of Ed compromises Yki phosphorylation, resulting in elevated Yki activity that increases Hpo target gene expression and drives tissue overgrowth. Ed physically interacts with and stabilizes the Hpo-binding partner Salvador (Sav) at adherens junctions. Ed/Sav interaction is promoted by cell-cell contact and requires dimerization of Ed cytoplasmic domain. Overexpression of Sav or dimerized Ed cytoplasmic domain suppressed loss-of-Ed phenotypes. We propose that Ed may link cell-cell contact to Hpo signaling through binding and stabilizing Sav, thus modulating the Hpo kinase activity.

Abstract: Summary
Members of the β-karyopherin family mediate nuclear import of ribosomal proteins and export of ribosomal subunits, both required for ribosome biogenesis. We report that transcription of the β-karyopherin genes importin 7 (IPO7) and exportin 1 (XPO1), and several additional nuclear import receptors, is regulated positively by c-Myc and negatively by p53. Partial IPO7 depletion triggers p53 activation and p53-dependent growth arrest. Activation of p53 by IPO7 knockdown has distinct features of ribosomal biogenesis stress, with increased binding of Mdm2 to ribosomal proteins L5 and L11 (RPL5 and RPL11). Furthermore, p53 activation is dependent on RPL5 and RPL11. Of note, IPO7 and XPO1 are frequently overexpressed in cancer. Altogether, we propose that c-Myc and p53 counter each other in the regulation of elements within the nuclear transport machinery, thereby exerting opposing effects on the rate of ribosome biogenesis. Perturbation of this balance may play a significant role in promoting cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The repression of transcription, through the concerted actions of tissue specific DNA binding proteins, Polycomb repressor complexes, and DNA methylation, is essential for maintaining stem cell pluripotency and for cell fate specification in development. In this report, we show that recruitment of the co-repressor protein Grg4 to a Pax DNA-binding site displaces the adaptor protein PTIP and a histone H3K4me complex. Grg4 recruits the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 to chromatin resulting in symmetric H4R3 dimethylation. PRMT5 is essential for recruiting Polycomb proteins, in a Pax2/Grg4 dependent manner, which results in H3K27 methylation. These data define the early epigenetic events in response to Pax/Grg mediated gene repression and demonstrate that a single DNA binding protein can recruit either an activator or a repressor complex depending on the availability of Grg4. These data suggest a model for understanding the initiation of Groucho/Grg/TLE mediated gene silencing.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular pathways are established and maintained by stochastic interactions of highly mobile molecules. The nucleolus plays a central role in the regulation of these molecular networks by capturing and immobilizing proteins. Here, we report a function for noncoding RNA (ncRNA) in the regulation of protein dynamics of key cellular factors, including VHL, Hsp70 and MDM2/PML. Stimuli-specific loci of the nucleolar intergenic spacer produce ncRNA capable of capturing and immobilizing proteins that encode a discrete peptidic code referred to as the nucleolar detention sequence (NoDS). Disruption of the NoDS/intergenic RNA interaction enables proteins to evade nucleolar sequestration and retain their dynamic profiles. Mislocalization of intergenic ncRNA triggers protein immobilization outside of the nucleolus, demonstrating that these ncRNA species can operate independently from the nucleolar architecture. We propose a model whereby protein immobilization by ncRNA is a posttranslational regulatory mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Tumorigenesis is caused by an uncontrolled cell cycle and the altered expression of many genes. Here, we report a gene CREPT that is preferentially expressed in diverse human tumors. Overexpression of CREPT accelerates tumor growth, whereas depletion of CREPT demonstrates a reversed effect. CREPT regulates cyclin D1 expression by binding to its promoter, enhancing its transcription both in vivo and in vitro, and interacting with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Interestingly, CREPT promotes the formation of a chromatin loop and prevents RNAPII from reading through the 3′ end termination site of the gene. Our findings reveal a mechanism where CREPT increases cyclin D1 transcription during tumorigenesis, through enhancing the recruitment of RNAPII to the promoter region, possibly, as well as chromatin looping.

Abstract: Relative to mammals, the neuroendocrine control of pituitary growth hormone (GH) secretion and synthesis in teleost fish involves numerous stimulatory and inhibitory regulators, many of which are delivered to the somatotrophs via direct innervation. Among teleosts, how multifactorial regulation of somatotroph functions are mediated at the level of post-receptor signalling is best characterized in goldfish. Supplemented with recent findings, this review focuses on the known intracellular signal transduction mechanisms mediating the ligand- and function-specific actions in multifactorial control of GH release and synthesis, as well as basal GH secretion, in goldfish somatotrophs. These include membrane voltage-sensitive ion channels, Na+/H+ antiport, Ca2+ signalling, multiple pharmacologically distinct intracellular Ca2+ stores, cAMP/PKA, PKC, nitric oxide, cGMP, MEK/ERK and PI3K. Signalling pathways mediating the major neuroendocrine regulators of mammalian somatotrophs, as well as those in other major teleost study model systems are also briefly highlighted. Interestingly, unlike mammals, spontaneous action potential firings are not observed in goldfish somatotrophs in culture. Furthermore, three goldfish brain somatostatin forms directly affect pituitary GH secretion via ligand-specific actions on membrane ion channels and intracellular Ca2+ levels, as well as exert isoform-specific action on basal and stimulated GH mRNA expression, suggesting the importance of somatostatins other than somatostatin-14.

Abstract: Summary
In most olfactory systems studied to date, neurons that express the same odorant receptor (Or) gene are scattered across sensory epithelia, intermingled with neurons that express different Or genes. In Drosophila, olfactory sensilla that express the same Or gene are dispersed on the antenna and the maxillary palp. Here we show that Or identity is specified in a spatially stereotyped pattern by the cell-autonomous activity of the transcriptional regulators Engrailed and Dachshund. Olfactory sensilla then become highly motile and disperse beneath the epidermis. Thus, positional information and cell motility underlie the dispersed patterns of Drosophila Or gene expression.

Abstract: Phosphatidylserine (PS) is usually confined to the inner leaflet of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane. It may become externalised in various conditions, however, notably in RBCs from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) where exposed PS may contribute to anaemic and ischaemic complications. PS externalisation requires both inhibition of the aminophospholipid translocase (or flippase) and activation of the scramblase. Both may follow from elevation of intracellular Ca2+. Flippase inhibition occurs at low [Ca2+]i, about 1μM, but [Ca2+]i required for scrambling is reported to be much higher (around 100μM). In this work, FITC-labelled lactadherin and FACS were used to measure externalised PS, with [Ca2+]i altered using bromo-A23187 and EGTA/Ca2+ mixtures. Two components of Ca2+-induced scrambling were apparent, of high (EC50 1.8±0.3μM) and low (306±123μM) affinity, in RBCs from normal individuals and the commonest SCD genotypes, HbSS and HbSC. The high affinity component was lost in the presence of unphysiologically high [Mg2+] but was unaffected by high K+ (90mM) or vanadate (1mM). The high affinity component accounted for PS scrambling in ≥2/3rd RBCs. It is likely to be most significant in vivo and may be involved in the pathophysiology of SCD or other conditions involving eryptosis.

Abstract: Epigenetic methylation change is a major process that occurs during cancer development. Even though many tumor-related genes have been identified based on their relationship between methylation and expression, few studies have been conducted to investigate the relevant biological pathways involved in these changes. To identify essential pathways likely to be affected by methylation in breast cancer, we examined a pool of genes in which expression was upregulated after induction of demethylation by 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine (Aza) in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Genome-wide demethylation was confirmed by monitoring the demethylation of a previously known gene, SULT1A1. Overall, 210 and 213 genes were found to be upregulated and downregulated (fold change > 2), respectively, in common in cells treated with 5 and 10 μM of Aza. Network analysis of these 423 genes with altered expression patterns identified the involvement of a cancer related network of genes that were heavily regulated by TNF-α in breast tumorigenesis. Our results suggest that epigenetic dysregulation of cellular processes relevant to TNF-α-dependent apoptosis may be intimately involved in tumorigenesis in MCF-7 cells.

Abstract: Normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts exhibit growth-dependent changes in electrophysiological properties and intracellular calcium dynamics. The transition from a quiescent state to a density-arrested state results in altered calcium entry characteristics. This coincides with modulation of the expression of the genes encoding the calcium channels Trpc1, Trpc6 and Orai1, and of the intracellular calcium sensor Stim1. In the present study we have used gene selective short hairpin (sh) RNAs against these various genes to investigate their role in (a) capacitative store-operated calcium entry (SOCE); (b) non-capacitative OAG-induced receptor-operated calcium entry (ROCE); and (c) prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α)-induced Ca2+-oscillations in NRK fibroblasts. Intracellular calcium measurements revealed that knockdown of the genes encoding Trpc1, Orai1 and Stim1 each caused a significant reduction of SOCE in NRK cells, whereas knockdown of the gene encoding Trpc6 reduced only the OAG-induced ROCE. Furthermore, our data show that knockdown of the genes encoding Trpc1, Orai1 and Stim1, but not Trpc6, substantially reduced the frequency (up to 60%) of PGF2α-induced Ca2+ oscillations in NRK cells. These results indicate that in NRK cells distinct calcium channels control the processes of SOCE, ROCE and PGF2α-induced Ca2+ oscillations.

Abstract: Summary
Bim is a proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member. In response to death stimuli, Bim dissociates from the dynein light chain 1 (DYNLL1/LC8), where it is inactive, and can then initiate Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. We found that Bim depletion increases autophagosome synthesis in cells and in vivo, and this effect is inhibited by overexpression of cell death-deficient Bim. Bim inhibits autophagy by interacting with Beclin 1, an autophagy regulator, and this interaction is facilitated by LC8. Bim bridges the Beclin 1-LC8 interaction and thereby inhibits autophagy by mislocalizing Beclin 1 to the dynein motor complex. Starvation, an autophagic stimulus, induces Bim phosphorylation, which abrogates LC8 binding to Bim, leading to dissociation of Bim and Beclin 1. Our data suggest that Bim switches locations between apoptosis-inactive/autophagy-inhibitory and apoptosis-active/autophagy-permissive sites.

Abstract: Summary
Transient receptor potential melastatin-like 7 (TRPM7) is a channel protein that also contains a regulatory serine-threonine kinase domain. Here, we find that Trpm7−/− T cells are deficient in Fas-receptor-induced apoptosis and that TRPM7 channel activity participates in the apoptotic process and is regulated by caspase-dependent cleavage. This function of TRPM7 is dependent on its function as a channel, but not as a kinase. TRPM7 is cleaved by caspases at D1510, disassociating the carboxy-terminal kinase domain from the pore without disrupting the phosphotransferase activity of the released kinase but substantially increasing TRPM7 ion channel activity. Furthermore, we show that TRPM7 regulates endocytic compartmentalization of the Fas receptor after receptor stimulation, an important process for apoptotic signaling through Fas receptors. These findings raise the possibility that other members of the TRP channel superfamily are also regulated by caspase-mediated cleavage, with wide-ranging implications for cell death and differentiation.

Abstract: The process of neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals is a target for a wide array of presynaptic toxins produced by various species, from humble bacteria to arthropods to vertebrate animals. Unlike other toxins, most presynaptic neurotoxins do not kill cells but simply inhibit or activate synaptic transmission. In this review, we describe two types of presynaptic neurotoxins: clostridial toxins and latrotoxins, which are, respectively, the most potent blockers and stimulators of neurotransmitter release. These toxins have been instrumental in defining presynaptic functions and are now widely used in research and medicine. Here, we would like to analyse the diversity of these toxins and demonstrate how the knowledge of their structures and mechanisms of action can help us to design better tools for research and medical applications. We will look at natural and synthetic variations of these exquisite molecular machines, highlighting recent advances in our understanding of presynaptic toxins and questions that remain to be answered. If we can decipher how a given biomolecule is modified by nature to target different species, we will be able to design new variants that carry only desired characteristics to achieve specific therapeutic, agricultural or research goals. Indeed, a number of research groups have already initiated a quest to harness the power of natural toxins with the aim of making them more specifically targeted and safer for future research and medical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Resveratrol induces mitochondrial biogenesis and protects against metabolic decline, but whether SIRT1 mediates these benefits is the subject of debate. To circumvent the developmental defects of germline SIRT1 knockouts, we have developed an inducible system that permits whole-body deletion of SIRT1 in adult mice. Mice treated with a moderate dose of resveratrol showed increased mitochondrial biogenesis and function, AMPK activation, and increased NAD+ levels in skeletal muscle, whereas SIRT1 knockouts displayed none of these benefits. A mouse overexpressing SIRT1 mimicked these effects. A high dose of resveratrol activated AMPK in a SIRT1-independent manner, demonstrating that resveratrol dosage is a critical factor. Importantly, at both doses of resveratrol no improvements in mitochondrial function were observed in animals lacking SIRT1. Together these data indicate that SIRT1 plays an essential role in the ability of moderate doses of resveratrol to stimulate AMPK and improve mitochondrial function both in vitro and in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
PRAS40 has recently been identified as a protein that couples insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) to TORC1 activation in cell culture; however, the physiological function of PRAS40 is not known. In this study, we investigate flies lacking PRAS40. Surprisingly, we find both biochemically and genetically that PRAS40 couples IIS to TORC1 activation in a tissue-specific manner, regulating TORC1 activity in ovaries but not in other tissues of the animal. PRAS40 thereby regulates fertility but not growth of the fly, allowing distinct physiological functions of TORC1 to be uncoupled. We also show that the main function of PRAS40 in vivo is to regulate TORC1 activity, and not to act as a downstream target and effector of TORC1. Finally, this work sheds some light on the question of whether TORC1 activity is coupled to IIS in vivo.

Abstract: Neurotensin, a tridecapeptide localized in the gut to discrete enteroendocrine cells of the small bowel mucosa, is a hormone that plays an important role in gastrointestinal secretion, growth, and motility. Neurotensin has inhibitory and excitatory effects on peristaltic activity and produces contractile and relaxant responses in intestinal smooth muscle. Our objective in this study is to investigate the effects of neurotensin in small intestinal interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and elucidate the mechanism. To determine the electrophysiological effects of neurotensin on ICC, wholecell patch clamp recordings were performed in cultured ICC from the small intestine. Exposure to neurotensin depolarized the membrane of pacemaker cells and produced tonic inward pacemaker currents. Only neurotensin receptor1 was identified when RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry were performed with mRNA isolated from small intestinal ICC and c-Kit positive cells. Neurotensin-induced tonic inward pacemaker currents were blocked by external Na+-free solution and in the presence of flufenamic acid, an inhibitor of non-selective cation channels. Furthermore, neurotensin-induced action is blocked either by treatment with U73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, or thapsigargin, a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor in ICC. We found that neurotensin increased spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ oscillations as seen with fluo4/AM recording. These results suggest that neurotensin modulates pacemaker currents via the activation of non-selective cation channels by intracellular Ca2+-release through neurotensin receptor1.

Abstract: Summary
Collective cell migration requires maintenance of adhesive contacts between adjacent cells, coordination of polarized cell protrusions, and generation of propulsive traction forces. We demonstrate that mechanical force applied locally to C-cadherins on single Xenopus mesendoderm cells is sufficient to induce polarized cell protrusion and persistent migration typical of individual cells within a collectively migrating tissue. Local tension on cadherin adhesions induces reorganization of the keratin intermediate filament network toward these stressed sites. Plakoglobin, a member of the catenin family, is localized to cadherin adhesions under tension and is required for both mechanoresponsive cell behavior and assembly of the keratin cytoskeleton at the rear of these cells. Local tugging forces on cadherins occur in vivo through interactions with neighboring cells, and these forces result in coordinate changes in cell protrusive behavior. Thus, cadherin-dependent force-inducible regulation of cell polarity in single mesendoderm cells represents an emergent property of the intact tissue.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor cylindromatosis (CYLD) inhibits the NFκB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation pathways by deubiquitinating upstream regulatory factors. Here we show that liver-specific disruption of CYLD triggers hepatocyte cell death in the periportal area via spontaneous and chronic activation of TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). This is followed by hepatic stellate cell and Kupffer cell activation, which promotes progressive fibrosis, inflammation, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production, and expansion of hepatocyte apoptosis toward the central veins. At later stages, compensatory proliferation results in the development of cancer foci featuring re-expression of oncofetal hepatic and stem cell-specific genes. The results demonstrate that, in the liver, CYLD acts as an important regulator of hepatocyte homeostasis, protecting cells from spontaneous apoptosis by preventing uncontrolled TAK1 and JNK activation.

Abstract: Summary
Sprouting angiogenesis, crucial for the development of new blood vessels, is a prime example of collective migration in which endothelial cells migrate as a group joined via cadherin-containing adherens junctions (AJ). The actomyosin apparatus is connected to AJ and generates contractile forces, which, depending on their strength and duration, increase or decrease cell cohesion. Thus, appropriate spatiotemporal control of junctional myosin is critical, but the mechanisms underlying it are incompletely understood. We show that Raf-1 is an essential component of this regulatory network and that its ablation impairs endothelial cell cohesion, sprouting, and tumor-induced angiogenesis. Mechanistically, Raf-1 is recruited to VE-cadherin complexes by a mechanism involving the small G protein Rap1 and is required to bring the Rho effector Rok-α to nascent AJs. This Raf-1-mediated fine tuning of Rok-α signaling allows the activation of junctional myosin and the timely maturation of AJ essential for maintaining cell cohesion during sprouting angiogenesis.

Abstract: Bradykinin (BK) is involved in bone resorption in chronic inflammatory diseases. During bone formation, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) plays an important role in the regulation of Ca2+. In osteoblasts, 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulates transmembrane influx of Ca2+ through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCCs). Voltage sensitive Ca2+ channels serve as crucial mediators of membrane excitability and many Ca2+-dependent functions, including bone growth, regulation of proliferation, enzyme activity and gene expression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of BK and 1,25(OH)2D3 on VSCC currents carried by Ba2+ (IBa). Application of 1,25(OH)2D3 facilitated IBa in a voltage-dependent manner. Pretreatment with SQ22536 (an adenylate cyclase inhibitor) attenuated 1,25(OH)2D3-induced facilitation of IBa. Bradykinin and BK1 receptor agonist [Lys-des-Arg9]-BK also facilitated IBa. After 24h or 7days exposure to BK, that is, under chronic inflammatory conditions, application of 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited IBa. In addition, pretreatment with PD98,059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, attenuated 1,25(OH)2D3-induced inhibition of IBa. These results indicate that, under normal conditions, 1,25(OH)2D3 acts with adenylate cyclase to facilitate VSCCs, whereas under chronic inflammatory conditions it acts with MAPK to inhibit VSCCs in pre-osteoblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Adaptation under similar selective pressure often leads to comparable phenotypes. A longstanding question is whether such phenotypic repeatability entails similar (parallelism) or different genotypic changes (convergence). To better understand this, we characterized mutations that optimized expression of a plasmid-borne metabolic pathway during laboratory evolution of a bacterium. Expressing these pathway genes was essential for growth but came with substantial costs. Starting from overexpression, replicate populations founded by this bacterium all evolved to reduce expression. Despite this phenotypic repetitiveness, the underlying mutational spectrum was highly diverse. Analysis of these plasmid mutations identified three distinct means to modulate gene expression: (1) reducing the gene copy number, (2) lowering transcript stability, and (3) integration of the pathway-bearing plasmid into the host genome. Our study revealed diverse molecular changes beneath convergence to a simple phenotype. This complex genotype-phenotype mapping presents a challenge to inferring genetic evolution based solely on phenotypic changes.

Abstract: Here we examine the potential coupling between the synthesis of secretory proteins and the sensitivity of exocytosis to the concentration of free Ca2+ in the cytosol ([Ca2+]i) in plant cell. We therefore monitor in tobacco protoplasts the excursion of the membrane capacitance in response to an elevation of [Ca2+]i as a measure for exocytotic activity. The data show that a ramp like elevation of [Ca2+]i generates in protoplasts from wild type plants and from transgenic plants, which overexpress the secreted α-amylase, an exocytotic burst with an initial steep and a subsequent slow phase. The largest capacitive burst is obtained in α-amylase producing plants and the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i evoked Cm excursion is a function of the amylase synthesis of the plants. The data support a model according to which plant cells have at least two serial [Ca2+]i sensitive processes in the final steps of their exocytotic pathway. The overproduction of a secreted cargo does not affect the kinetics of this process but the number of vesicles in pools upstream of the [Ca2+]i sensitive steps.

We establish a critical link between stress-induced JNK activation, mitofusin 2, which is an essential component of the mitochondrial outer membrane fusion apparatus, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). JNK phosphorylation of mitofusin 2 in response to cellular stress leads to recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Huwe1/Mule/ARF-BP1/HectH9/E3Histone/Lasu1 to mitofusin 2, with the BH3 domain of Huwe1 implicated in this interaction. This results in ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of mitofusin 2, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and enhanced apoptotic cell death. The stability of a nonphosphorylatable mitofusin 2 mutant is unaffected by stress and protective against apoptosis. Conversely, a mitofusin 2 phosphomimic is more rapidly degraded without cellular stress. These findings demonstrate how proximal signaling events can influence both mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis through phosphorylation-stimulated degradation of the mitochondrial fusion machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem (hES) cells activate a rapid apoptotic response after DNA damage but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. A critical mediator of apoptosis is Bax, which is reported to become active and translocate to the mitochondria only after apoptotic stimuli. Here we show that undifferentiated hES cells constitutively maintain Bax in its active conformation. Surprisingly, active Bax was maintained at the Golgi rather than at the mitochondria, thus allowing hES cells to effectively minimize the risks associated with having preactivated Bax. After DNA damage, active Bax rapidly translocated to the mitochondria by a p53-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, upon differentiation, Bax was no longer active, and cells were not acutely sensitive to DNA damage. Thus, maintenance of Bax in its active form is a unique mechanism that can prime hES cells for rapid death, likely to prevent the propagation of mutations during the early critical stages of embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
The chemical identity and integrity of the genome is challenged by the incorporation of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) in place of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) during replication. Misincorporation is limited by the selectivity of DNA replicases. We show that accumulation of ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) in the genome causes replication stress and has toxic consequences, particularly in the absence of RNase H1 and RNase H2, which remove rNMPs. We demonstrate that postreplication repair (PRR) pathways—MMS2-dependent template switch and Pol ζ-dependent bypass—are crucial for tolerating the presence of rNMPs in the chromosomes; indeed, we show that Pol ζ efficiently replicates over 1–4 rNMPs. Moreover, cells lacking RNase H accumulate mono- and polyubiquitylated PCNA and have a constitutively activated PRR. Our findings describe a crucial function for RNase H1, RNase H2, template switch, and translesion DNA synthesis in overcoming rNTPs misincorporated during DNA replication, and may be relevant for the pathogenesis of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Inappropriate homologous recombination (HR) causes genomic instability and cancer. In yeast, the UvrD family helicase Srs2 is recruited to sites of DNA replication by SUMO-modified PCNA, where it acts to restrict HR by disassembling toxic RAD51 nucleofilaments. How human cells control recombination at replication forks is unknown. Here, we report that the protein PARI, containing a UvrD-like helicase domain, is a PCNA-interacting partner required for preservation of genome stability in human and DT40 chicken cells. Using cell-based and biochemical assays, we show that PARI restricts unscheduled recombination by interfering with the formation of RAD51-DNA HR structures. Finally, we show that PARI knockdown suppresses the genomic instability of Fanconi Anemia/BRCA pathway-deficient cells. Thus, we propose that PARI is a long sought-after factor that suppresses inappropriate recombination events at mammalian replication forks.

Abstract: Summary
The cell types of the plant root are first specified early during embryogenesis and are maintained throughout plant life. Auxin plays an essential role in embryonic root initiation, in part through the action of the ARF5/MP transcription factor and its auxin-labile inhibitor IAA12/BDL. MP and BDL function in embryonic cells but promote auxin transport to adjacent extraembryonic suspensor cells, including the quiescent center precursor (hypophysis). Here we show that a cell-autonomous auxin response within this cell is required for root meristem initiation. ARF9 and redundant ARFs, and their inhibitor IAA10, act in suspensor cells to mediate hypophysis specification and, surprisingly, also to prevent transformation to embryo identity. ARF misexpression, and analysis of the short suspensor mutant, demonstrates that lineage-specific expression of these ARFs is required for normal embryo development. These results imply the existence of a prepattern for a cell-type-specific auxin response that underlies the auxin-dependent specification of embryonic cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Proinflammatory cytokine TNFα plays critical roles in promoting malignant cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis in many cancers. However, the mechanism of TNFα-mediated tumor development remains unclear. Here, we show that IKKα, an important downstream kinase of TNFα, interacts with and phosphorylates FOXA2 at S107/S111, thereby suppressing FOXA2 transactivation activity and leading to decreased NUMB expression, and further activates the downstream NOTCH pathway and promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Moreover, we found that levels of IKKα, pFOXA2 (S107/111), and activated NOTCH1 were significantly higher in hepatocellular carcinoma tumors than in normal liver tissues and that pFOXA2 (S107/111) expression was positively correlated with IKKα and activated NOTCH1 expression in tumor tissues. Therefore, dysregulation of NUMB-mediated suppression of NOTCH1 by TNFα/IKKα-associated FOXA2 inhibition likely contributes to inflammation-mediated cancer pathogenesis. Here, we report a TNFα/IKKα/FOXA2/NUMB/NOTCH1 pathway that is critical for inflammation-mediated tumorigenesis and may provide a target for clinical intervention in human cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most common inherited muscular dystrophies. The causative gene remains controversial and the mechanism of pathophysiology unknown. Here we identify genes associated with germline and early stem cell development as targets of the DUX4 transcription factor, a leading candidate gene for FSHD. The genes regulated by DUX4 are reliably detected in FSHD muscle but not in controls, providing direct support for the model that misexpression of DUX4 is a causal factor for FSHD. Additionally, we show that DUX4 binds and activates LTR elements from a class of MaLR endogenous primate retrotransposons and suppresses the innate immune response to viral infection, at least in part through the activation of DEFB103, a human defensin that can inhibit muscle differentiation. These findings suggest specific mechanisms of FSHD pathology and identify candidate biomarkers for disease diagnosis and progression.

Abstract: Summary
The timing of commitment and cell-cycle exit within progenitor populations during neurogenesis is a fundamental decision that impacts both the number and identity of neurons produced during development. We show here that microRNA-9 plays a key role in this process through the direct inhibition of targets with antagonistic functions. Across the ventricular zone of the developing zebrafish hindbrain, miR-9 expression occurs at a range of commitment stages. Abrogating miR-9 function transiently delays cell-cycle exit, leading to the increased generation of late-born neuronal populations. Target protection analyses in vivo identify the progenitor-promoting genes her6 and zic5 and the cell-cycle exit-promoting gene elavl3/HuC as sequential targets of miR-9 as neurogenesis proceeds. We propose that miR-9 activity generates an ambivalent progenitor state poised to respond to both progenitor maintenance and commitment cues, which may be necessary to adjust neuronal production to local extrinsic signals during late embryogenesis.

Abstract: Available methods to measure mitochondrial [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]M) include both targeted proteins and fluorescent dyes. Targeted proteins usually report much higher [Ca2+]M values than fluorescent dyes, up to two orders of magnitude. However, we show here that the low-Ca2+-affinity dye rhod-5N provides [Ca2+]M values similar to those reported by targeted aequorin, suggesting that the discrepancies are mainly due to the higher Ca2+-affinity of the fluorescent dyes used. We find rhod-5N has an apparent in situ intramitochondrial Kd around 0.5mM. Addition of Ca2+ buffers containing between 4.5 and 10μM [Ca2+] to permeabilized cells loaded with rhod-5N induced increases in calibrated [Ca2+]M up to the 100μM–1mM range, which were dependent on mitochondrial membrane potential. Ca2+ release from mitochondria was largely dependent on [Na+]. We have then used rhod-5N loaded cells to investigate the [Ca2+]M response to agonist stimulation at the single-cell and subcellular level. The [Ca2+]M peaks induced by histamine varied by nearly 10-fold among different cells, with a mean about 25μM. In the presence of the Ca2+ uniporter stimulator kaempferol, the [Ca2+]M peaks induced by histamine were also highly variable, and the mean [Ca2+]M peak was 3-fold higher. Simultaneous measurement of cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] peaks showed little correlation among the heights of the peaks in both compartments. Studying the [Ca2+]M peaks at the subcellular level, we found significant heterogeneities among regions in the same cell. In particular, the [Ca2+]M increase in mitochondrial regions close to the nucleus was more than double that of mitochondrial regions far from the nucleus.

Abstract: The present study shows the localization of epidermal and dermal proteins produced in lizard skin cultivated in vitro. Cells from the skin have been cultured for up to one month to detect the expression of keratins, actin, vimentin and extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan, elastin and collagen I). Keratinocytes and dermal cells weakly immunoreact for Pan-Cytokeratin but not with the K17-antibody at the beginning of the cell culture when numerous keratin bundles are present in keratinocyte cytoplasm. The dense keratin network disappears after 7–12 days in culture, and K17 becomes detectable in both keratinocytes and mesenchymal cells isolated from the dermis. While most epidermal cells are lost after 2 weeks of in vitro cultivation dermal cells proliferate and form a pellicle of variable thickness made of 3–8 cell layers. The fibroblasts of this dermal equivalent produces an extracellular matrix containing chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan, collagen I, elastic fibers and fibronectin, explaining the attachment of the pellicle to the substratum. The study indicates that after improving keratinocyte survival a skin equivalent for lizard epidermis would be feasible as a useful tool to analyze the influence of the dermis on the process of epidermal differentiation and the control of the shedding cycle in squamates.

Abstract: The mouse cortical collecting duct (CCD) M-1 cells were grown to confluency on coverslips to assess the interaction between TRPV4 and Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated strong expression of TRPV4, along with the CCD marker, aquaporin-2, and the Ca2+-activated K+ channels, the small conductance SK3 (KCa2.3) channel and large conductance BKα channel (KCa1.1). TRPV4 overexpression studies demonstrated little physical dependency of the K+ channels on TRPV4. However, activation of TRPV4 by hypotonic swelling (or GSK1016790A, a selective agonist) or inhibition by the selective antagonist, HC-067047, demonstrated a strong dependency of SK3 and BK-α activation on TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx. Selective inhibition of BK-α channel (Iberiotoxin) or SK3 channel (apamin), thereby depolarizing the cells, further revealed a significant dependency of TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx on activation of both K+ channels. It is concluded that a synergistic cross-talk exists between the TRPV4 channel and SK3 and BK-α channels to provide a tight functional regulation between the channel groups. This cross-talk may be progressive in nature where the initial TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx would first activate the highly Ca2+-sensitive SK3 channel which, in turn, would lead to enhanced Ca2+ influx and activation of the less Ca2+-sensitive BK channel.

Abstract: Voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels are transmembrane proteins that form Ca2+-selective pores gated by depolarization and are essential regulators of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. By providing a pathway for rapid Ca2+ influx, CaV channels couple membrane depolarization to a wide array of cellular responses including neurotransmission, muscle contraction and gene expression. CaV channels fall into two major classes, low voltage-activated (LVA) and high voltage-activated (HVA). The ion-conducting pathway of HVA channels is the α1 subunit, which typically contains associated β and α2δ ancillary subunits that regulate the properties of the channel. Although it is widely acknowledged that α2δ-1 is post-translationally cleaved into an extracellular α2 polypeptide and a membrane-anchored δ protein that remain covalently linked by disulfide bonds, to date the contribution of different cysteine (Cys) residues to the formation of disulfide bridges between these proteins has not been investigated. In the present report, by predicting disulfide connectivity with bioinformatics, molecular modeling and protein biochemistry experiments we have identified two Cys residues involved in the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond of critical importance for the structure and function of the α2δ-1 subunit. Site directed-mutagenesis of Cys404 (located in the von Willebrand factor-A region of α2) and Cys1047 (in the extracellular domain of δ) prevented the association of the α2 and δ peptides upon proteolysis, suggesting that the mature protein is linked by a single intermolecular disulfide bridge. Furthermore, co-expression of mutant forms of α2δ-1 Cys404Ser and Cys1047Ser with recombinant neuronal N-type (CaV2.2α1/β3) channels, showed decreased whole-cell patch-clamp currents indicating that the disulfide bond between these residues is required for α2δ-1 function.

Abstract: Endocrine pituitary cells express numerous voltage-gated Na+, Ca2+, K+, and Cl− channels and several ligand-gated channels, and they fire action potentials spontaneously. Depending on the cell type, this electrical activity can generate localized or global Ca2+ signals, the latter reaching the threshold for stimulus–secretion coupling. These cells also express numerous G-protein-coupled receptors, which can stimulate or silence electrical activity and Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and hormone release. Receptors positively coupled to the adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway stimulate electrical activity with cAMP, which activates hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-regulated channels directly, or by cAMP-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylation of K+, Na+, Ca2+, and/or non-selective cation-conducting channels. Receptors that are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase signaling pathways inhibit spontaneous electrical activity and accompanied Ca2+ transients predominantly through the activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels and the inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The Ca2+-mobilizing receptors activate inositol trisphosphate-gated Ca2+ channels in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to Ca2+ release in an oscillatory or non-oscillatory manner, depending on the cell type. This Ca2+ release causes a cell type-specific modulation of electrical activity and intracellular Ca2+ handling.

Abstract: The fluo family of indicators is frequently used in studying Ca2+ physiology; however, choosing which fluo indicator to use is not obvious. Indicator properties are typically determined in well-defined aqueous solutions. Inside cells, however, the properties can change markedly. We have characterized each of three fluo variants (fluo-2MA, fluo-3 and fluo-4) in two forms—the acetoxymethyl (AM) ester and the K+ salt. We loaded indicators into rat ventricular myocytes and used confocal microscopy to monitor depolarization-induced fluorescence changes and fractional shortening. Myocytes loaded with the indicator AM esters showed significantly different Ca2+ transients and fractional shortening kinetics. Loading the K+ salts via whole-cell patch-pipette eliminated differences between fluo-3 and fluo-4, but not fluo-2MA. Cells loaded with different indicator AM esters showed different staining patterns—suggesting differential loading into organelles. Ca2+ dissociation constants (Kd,Ca), measured in protein-rich buffers mimicking the cytosol were significantly higher than values determined in simple buffers. This increase in Kd,Ca (decrease in Ca2+ affinity) was greatest for fluo-3 and fluo-4, and least for fluo-2MA. We conclude that the structurally-similar fluo variants differ with respect to cellular loading, subcellular compartmentalization, and intracellular Ca2+ affinity. Therefore, judicious choice of fluo indicator and loading procedure is advisable when designing experiments.

Abstract: In oxygen sensing carotid glomus (type 1) cells, the hypoxia-triggered depolarization can be mimicked by mitochondrial inhibitors. We examined the possibility that, other than causing glomus cell depolarization, mitochondrial inhibition can regulate transmitter release via changes in Ca2+ dynamics. Under whole-cell voltage clamp conditions, application of the mitochondrial inhibitors, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or cyanide caused a dramatic slowing in the decay of the depolarization-triggered Ca2+ signal in glomus cells. In contrast, inhibition of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) pump or sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump had much smaller effects. Consistent with the notion that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is the dominant mechanism in cytosolic Ca2+ removal, inhibition of the mitochondrial uniporter with ruthenium red slowed the decay of the depolarization-triggered Ca2+ signal. Hypoxia also slowed cytosolic Ca2+ removal, suggesting a partial impairment of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Using membrane capacitance measurement, we found that the increase in the duration of the depolarization-triggered Ca2+ signal after mitochondrial inhibition was associated with an enhancement of the exocytotic response. The role of mitochondria in the regulation of Ca2+ signal and transmitter release from glomus cells highlights the importance of mitochondria in hypoxic chemotransduction in the carotid bodies.

Abstract: The ultrastructural organization of the spermatozoon of a cryptogonimid digenean, Aphallus tubarium, a parasite of Dentex dentex, is described. The spermatozoon possesses the elements found in other digeneans: two axonemes with 9+“1” pattern, a mitochondrion, a nucleus, cortical microtubules, external ornamentation and spine-like bodies. However, the mitochondrion appears as a cord with a bulge; this characteristic has never been described in other studied cryptogonimid and in other digeneans except in one lepocreadiid, Holorchis micracanthum. Likewise, the presence of a thin cytoplasm termination in the anterior part of the spermatozoon has never been pointed out in the cryptogonimids.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) has long been known to remove DNA lesions induced by chemical carcinogens, and the molecular mechanism has been partially elucidated. Here we demonstrate that in Schizosaccharomyces pombe a DNA recognition protein, alkyltransferase-like 1 (Atl1), can play a pivotal role in selecting a specific NER pathway, depending on the nature of the DNA modification. The relative ease of dissociation of Atl1 from DNA containing small O6-alkylguanines allows accurate completion of global genome repair (GGR), whereas strong Atl1 binding to bulky O6-alkylguanines blocks GGR, stalls the transcription machinery, and diverts the damage to transcription-coupled repair. Our findings redraw the initial stages of the NER process in those organisms that express an alkyltransferase-like gene and raise the question of whether or not O6-alkylguanine lesions that are poor substrates for the alkyltransferase proteins in higher eukaryotes might, by analogy, signal such lesions for repair by NER.

Abstract: Summary
The deubiquitylation enzyme USP7/HAUSP plays a major role in regulating genome stability and cancer prevention by controlling the key proteins involved in the DNA damage response. Despite this important role in controlling other proteins, USP7 itself has not been recognized as a target for regulation. Here, we report that USP7 regulation plays a central role in DNA damage signal transmission. We find that stabilization of Mdm2, and correspondingly p53 downregulation in unstressed cells, is accomplished by a specific isoform of USP7 (USP7S), which is phosphorylated at serine 18 by the protein kinase CK2. Phosphorylation stabilizes USP7S and thus contributes to Mdm2 stabilization and downregulation of p53. After ionizing radiation, dephosphorylation of USP7S by the ATM-dependent protein phosphatase PPM1G leads to USP7S downregulation, followed by Mdm2 downregulation and accumulation of p53. Our findings provide a quantitative transmission mechanism of the DNA damage signal to coordinate a p53-dependent DNA damage response.

Abstract: Summary
The connection between cancer and inflammation is widely recognized, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We report here that TIPE2 provides a molecular bridge from inflammation to cancer by targeting the Ras signaling pathway. TIPE2 binds the Ras-interacting domain of the RalGDS family of proteins, which are essential effectors of activated Ras. This binding prevented Ras from forming an active complex, thereby inhibiting the activation of the downstream signaling molecules Ral and AKT. Consequently, TIPE2 deficiency led to heightened activation of Ral and AKT, resistance to cell death, increased migration, and dysregulation of exocyst complex formation. Conversely, TIPE2 overexpression induced cell death and significantly inhibited Ras-induced tumorigenesis in mice. Importantly, TIPE2 expression was either completely lost or significantly downregulated in human hepatic cancer. Thus, TIPE2 is an inhibitor of both inflammation and cancer, and a potential drug target for inflammatory and neoplastic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Early leaf growth is sustained by cell proliferation and subsequent cell expansion that initiates at the leaf tip and proceeds in a basipetal direction. Using detailed kinematic and gene expression studies to map these stages during early development of the third leaf of Arabidopsis thaliana, we showed that the cell-cycle arrest front did not progress gradually down the leaf, but rather was established and abolished abruptly. Interestingly, leaf greening and stomatal patterning followed a similar basipetal pattern, but proliferative pavement cell and formative meristemoid divisions were uncoordinated in respect to onset and persistence. Genes differentially expressed during the transition from cell proliferation to expansion were enriched in genes involved in cell cycle, photosynthesis, and chloroplast retrograde signaling. Proliferating primordia treated with norflurazon, a chemical inhibitor of retrograde signaling, showed inhibited onset of cell expansion. Hence, differentiation of the photosynthetic machinery is important for regulating the exit from proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Expression of the mannose receptor (MRC1/CD206) identifies macrophage subtypes, such as alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) and M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which are endowed with tissue-remodeling, proangiogenic, and protumoral activity. However, the significance of MRC1 expression for TAM's protumoral activity is unclear. Here, we describe and characterize miR-511-3p, an intronic microRNA (miRNA) encoded by both mouse and human MRC1 genes. By using sensitive miRNA reporter vectors, we demonstrate robust expression and bioactivity of miR-511-3p in MRC1+ AAMs and TAMs. Unexpectedly, enforced expression of miR-511-3p tuned down the protumoral gene signature of MRC1+ TAMs and inhibited tumor growth. Our findings suggest that transcriptional activation of Mrc1 in TAMs evokes a genetic program orchestrated by miR-511-3p, which limits rather than enhances their protumoral functions. Besides uncovering a role for MRC1 as gatekeeper of TAM's protumoral genetic programs, these observations suggest that endogenous miRNAs may operate to establish thresholds for inflammatory cell activation in tumors.

Role of Actin Cytoskeleton in Brassinosteroid Signaling and in Its Integration with the Auxin Response in Plants,

Abstract: Summary
In plants, developmental programs and tropisms are modulated by the phytohormone auxin. Auxin reconfigures the actin cytoskeleton, which controls polar localization of auxin transporters such as PIN2 and thus determines cell-type-specific responses. In conjunction with a second growth-promoting phytohormone, brassinosteroid (BR), auxin synergistically enhances growth and gene transcription. We show that BR alters actin configuration and PIN2 localization in a manner similar to that of auxin. We describe a BR constitutive-response mutant that bears an allele of the ACTIN2 gene and shows altered actin configuration, PIN2 delocalization, and a broad array of phenotypes that recapitulate BR-treated plants. Moreover, we show that actin filament reconfiguration is sufficient to activate BR signaling, which leads to an enhanced auxin response. Our results demonstrate that the actin cytoskeleton functions as an integration node for the BR signaling pathway and auxin responsiveness.

Abstract: The melastatin transient receptor potential (TRP) channel, TRPM4, is a critical regulator of smooth muscle membrane potential and arterial tone. Activation of the channel is Ca2+-dependent, but prolonged exposures to high global Ca2+ causes rapid inactivation under conventional whole-cell patch clamp conditions. Using amphotericin B perforated whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, which minimally disrupts cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics, we recently showed that Ca2+ released from 1,2,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3R) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) activates TRPM4 channels, producing sustained transient inward cation currents (TICCs). Thus, Ca2+-dependent inactivation of TRPM4 may not be inherent to the channel itself but rather is a result of the recording conditions. We hypothesized that under conventional whole-cell configurations, loss of intrinsic cytosolic Ca2+ buffering following cell dialysis contributes to inactivation of TRPM4 channels. With the inclusion of the Ca2+ buffers ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA, 10mM) or bis-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA, 0.1mM) in the pipette solution, we mimic endogenous Ca2+ buffering and record novel, sustained whole-cell TICC activity from freshly-isolated cerebral artery myocytes. Biophysical properties of TICCs recorded under perforated and whole-cell patch clamp were nearly identical. Furthermore, whole-cell TICC activity was reduced by the selective TRPM4 inhibitor, 9-phenanthrol, and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of TRPM4. When a higher concentration (10mM) of BAPTA was included in the pipette solution, TICC activity was disrupted, suggesting that TRPM4 channels on the plasma membrane and IP3R on the SR are closely opposed but not physically coupled, and that endogenous Ca2+ buffer proteins play a critical role in maintaining TRPM4 channel activity in native cerebral artery smooth muscle cells.

Abstract: Summary
Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycogen catabolism and plays a key role in maintaining cellular and organismal glucose homeostasis. GP is the first protein whose function was discovered to be regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation, which is controlled by phosphorylase kinase (PhK) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Here we report that lysine acetylation negatively regulates GP activity by both inhibiting enzyme activity directly and promoting dephosphorylation. Acetylation of GP Lys470 enhances its interaction with the PP1 substrate-targeting subunit, GL, and PP1, thereby promoting GP dephosphorylation and inactivation. We show that GP acetylation is stimulated by glucose and insulin and inhibited by glucagon. Our results provide molecular insights into the intricate regulation of the classical GP and a functional crosstalk between protein acetylation and phosphorylation.

Abstract: Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 (TRPM3) is a widely expressed calcium-permeable non-selective cation channel that is stimulated by high concentrations of nifedipine or by physiological steroids that include pregnenolone sulphate. Here we sought to identify steroids that inhibit TRPM3. Channel activity was studied using calcium-measurement and patch-clamp techniques. Progesterone (0.01–10μM) suppressed TRPM3 activity evoked by pregnenolone sulphate. Progesterone metabolites and 17β-oestradiol were also inhibitory but the effects were relatively small. Dihydrotestosterone was an inhibitor at concentrations higher than 1μM. Corticosteroids lacked effect. Overlay assays indicated that pregnenolone sulphate, progesterone and dihydrotestosterone bound to TRPM3. In contrast to dihydrotestosterone, progesterone inhibited nifedipine-evoked TRPM3 activity or activity in the absence of an exogenous activator, suggesting a pregnenolone sulphate-independent mechanism of action. Dihydrotestosterone, like a non-steroid look-alike compound, acted as a competitive antagonist at the pregnenolone sulphate binding site. Progesterone inhibited endogenous TRPM3 in vascular smooth muscle cells. Relevance of TRPM3 or the progesterone effect to ovarian cells, which have been suggested to express TRPM3, was not identified. The data further define a chemical framework for competition with pregnenolone sulphate at TRPM3 and expand knowledge of steroid interactions with TRPM3, suggesting direct steroid binding and pregnenolone sulphate-independent inhibition by progesterone.

Abstract: Secretory granules of pancreatic β-cells contain high concentrations of Ca2+ ions that are co-released with insulin in the extracellular milieu upon activation of exocytosis. As a consequence, an increase in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]ext) in the microenvironment immediately surrounding β-cells should be expected following the exocytotic event. Using Ca2+-selective microelectrodes we show here that both high glucose and non-nutrient insulinotropic agents elicit a reversible increase of [Ca2+]ext within rat insulinoma (INS-1E) β-cells pseudoislets. The glucose-induced increases in [Ca2+]ext are blocked by pretreatment with different Ca2+ channel blockers. Physiological agonists acting as positive or negative modulators of the insulin secretion and drugs known to intersect the secretory machinery at different levels also induce [Ca2+]ext changes as predicted on the basis of their described action on insulin secretion. Finally, the glucose-induced [Ca2+]ext increase is strongly inhibited after disruption of the actin web, indicating that the dynamic [Ca2+]ext changes recorded in INS-1E pseudoislets by Ca2+-selective microelectrodes occur mainly as a consequence of exocytosis of Ca2+-rich granules. In conclusion, our data directly demonstrate that the extracellular spaces surrounding β-cells constitute a restricted domain where Ca2+ is co-released during insulin exocytosis, creating the basis for an autocrine/paracrine cell-to-cell communication system via extracellular Ca2+ sensors.

Abstract: The organization, morphological characteristics, and synaptic structure of photoreceptors in the adult zebrafish retina were studied using light and electron microscopy. Adult photoreceptors show a typical ordered tier arrangement with rods easily distinguished from cones based on outer segment (OS) morphology. Both rods and cones contain mitochondria within the inner segments (IS), including the large, electron-dense megamitochondria previously described (Kim et al.) Four major ultrastructural differences were observed between zebrafish rods and cones: (1) the membranes of cone lamellar disks showed a wider variety of relationships to the plasma membrane than those of rods, (2) cone pedicles typically had multiple synaptic ribbons, while rod spherules had 1–2 ribbons, (3) synaptic ribbons in rod spherules were ∼2 times longer than ribbons in cone pedicles, and (4) rod spherules had a more electron-dense cytoplasm than cone pedicles. Examination of photoreceptor terminals identified four synaptic relationships at cone pedicles: (1) invaginating contacts postsynaptic to cone ribbons forming dyad, triad, and quadrad synapses, (2) presumed gap junctions connecting adjacent postsynaptic processes invaginating into cone terminals, (3) basal junctions away from synaptic ribbons, and (4) gap junctions between adjacent photoreceptor terminals. More vitread and slightly farther removed from photoreceptor terminals, extracellular microtubule-like structures were identified in association with presumed horizontal cell processes in the OPL. These findings, the first to document the ultrastructure of the distal retina in adult zebrafish, indicate that zebrafish photoreceptors have many characteristics similar to other species, further supporting the use of zebrafish as a model for the vertebrate visual system.

Abstract: Aquaporins (AQPs), notably AQP-1 and AQP-9, may contribute to reabsorption of fluid and solute across the epididymis. Ethanol is related to be a toxicant affecting directly or indirectly the epididymis and the sperm motility. This study examined the expression of AQP-1 and AQP-9 in adult epididymis of the UChA and UChB 10% (v/v) ethanol-preferring rats, focusing the ethanol-induced hormonal disturbances upon the regulation of these AQPs. Chronic ethanol intake significantly decreased body weight, while UChA and UChB rats displayed a marked loss of epididymal weights. Both ethanol-consuming animals had a severe reduction of testosterone levels, whereas LH and 17β-estradiol were unchanged. Throughout the epididymis, a strong reaction to AQP-1 was observed in myoid and endothelial cells of the UChB ethanol-preferring rats, differently from a moderate intensity in the initial segment of the UChA rats. In addition, AQP-9 showed a strong immunoreaction in the apical membrane of principal cells at initial segment. In cauda epididymis, the level of AQP-9 was reduced along the microvillus projections in both UChA and UChB rats compared to controls. We conclude that chronic ethanol consumption modulates the androgen levels, thereby modifying the expression pattern of AQP-1 and 9 in the epididymis.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrient sensing and metabolic reprogramming are crucial for metazoan cell aging and tumor growth. Here, we identify metabolic and regulatory parallels between a layered, multicellular yeast colony and a tumor-affected organism. During development, a yeast colony stratifies into U and L cells occupying the upper and lower colony regions, respectively. U cells activate a unique metabolism controlled by the glutamine-induced TOR pathway, amino acid-sensing systems (SPS and Gcn4p) and signaling from mitochondria with lowered respiration. These systems jointly modulate U cell physiology, which adapts to nutrient limitations and utilize the nutrients released from L cells. Stress-resistant U cells share metabolic pathways and other similar characteristics with tumor cells, including the ability to proliferate. L cells behave similarly to stressed and starving cells, which activate degradative mechanisms to provide nutrients to U cells. Our data suggest a nutrient flow between both cell types, resembling the Cori cycle and glutamine-NH4+ shuttle between tumor and healthy metazoan cells.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) maintain high genomic plasticity, which is essential for their capacity to enter diverse differentiation pathways. Posttranscriptional modifications of chromatin histones play a pivotal role in maintaining this plasticity. We now report that one such modification, monoubiquitylation of histone H2B on lysine 120 (H2Bub1), catalyzed by the E3 ligase RNF20, increases during ESC differentiation and is required for efficient execution of this process. This increase is particularly important for the transcriptional induction of relatively long genes during ESC differentiation. Furthermore, we identify the deubiquitinase USP44 as a negative regulator of H2B ubiquitylation, whose downregulation during ESC differentiation contributes to the increase in H2Bub1. Our findings suggest that optimal ESC differentiation requires dynamic changes in H2B ubiquitylation patterns, which must occur in a timely and well-coordinated manner.

Abstract: Summary
A substantial amount of organismal complexity is thought to be encoded by enhancers which specify the location, timing, and levels of gene expression. In mammals there are more enhancers than promoters which are distributed both between and within genes. Here we show that activated, intragenic enhancers frequently act as alternative tissue-specific promoters producing a class of abundant, spliced, multiexonic poly(A)+ RNAs (meRNAs) which reflect the host gene's structure. meRNAs make a substantial and unanticipated contribution to the complexity of the transcriptome, appearing as alternative isoforms of the host gene. The low protein-coding potential of meRNAs suggests that many meRNAs may be byproducts of enhancer activation or underlie as-yet-unidentified RNA-encoded functions. Distinguishing between meRNAs and mRNAs will transform our interpretation of dynamic changes in transcription both at the level of individual genes and of the genome as a whole.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) leads to the dissociation of heterotrimeric G-proteins into Gα and Gβγ subunits, which go on to regulate various effectors involved in a panoply of cellular responses. During chemotaxis, Gβγ subunits regulate actin assembly and migration, but the protein(s) linking Gβγ to the actin cytoskeleton remains unknown. Here, we identified a Gβγ effector, ElmoE in Dictyostelium, and demonstrated that it is required for GPCR-mediated chemotaxis. Remarkably, ElmoE associates with Gβγ and Dock-like proteins to activate the small GTPase Rac, in a GPCR-dependent manner, and also associates with Arp2/3 complex and F-actin. Thus, ElmoE serves as a link between chemoattractant GPCRs, G-proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. The pathway, consisting of GPCR, Gβγ, Elmo/Dock, Rac, and Arp2/3, spatially guides the growth of dendritic actin networks in pseudopods of eukaryotic cells during chemotaxis.

Daam2 Is Required for Dorsal Patterning via Modulation of Canonical Wnt Signaling in the Developing Spinal Cord,

Abstract: Summary
The Daam family of proteins consists of Daam1 and Daam2. Although Daam1 participates in noncanonical Wnt signaling during gastrulation, Daam2 function remains completely uncharacterized. Here we describe the role of Daam2 in canonical Wnt signal transduction during spinal cord development. Loss-of-function studies revealed that Daam2 is required for dorsal progenitor identities and canonical Wnt signaling. These phenotypes are rescued by β-catenin, demonstrating that Daam2 functions in dorsal patterning through the canonical Wnt pathway. Complementary gain-of-function studies demonstrate that Daam2 amplifies Wnt signaling by potentiating ligand activation. Biochemical examination found that Daam2 association with Dvl3 is required for Wnt activity and dorsal patterning. Moreover, Daam2 stabilizes Dvl3/Axin2 binding, resulting in enhanced intracellular assembly of Dvl3/Axin2 complexes. These studies demonstrate that Daam2 modulates the formation of Wnt receptor complexes, revealing new insight into the functional diversity of Daam proteins and how canonical Wnt signaling contributes to pattern formation in the developing spinal cord.

Abstract: Summary
Pol II(G) is a distinct form of RNA polymerase II that contains the tightly associated Gdown1 polypeptide (encoded by POLR2M). Unlike Pol II, Pol II(G) is highly dependent upon Mediator for robust activator-dependent transcription in a biochemically defined in vitro system. Here, in vitro studies show that Gdown1 competes with TFIIF for binding to the RPB1 and RPB5 subunits of Pol II, thereby inhibiting an essential function of TFIIF in preinitiation complex assembly, but also that Mediator can actually facilitate Pol II(G) binding to the promoter prior to subsequent Mediator functions. Complementary ChIP and RNAi analyses reveal that Pol II(G) is recruited to promoter regions of subsets of actively transcribed genes, where it appears to restrict transcription. These and other results suggest that Pol II(G) may act to modulate some genes while simultaneously, as a poised (noninitiated) polymerase, setting the stage for Mediator-dependent enhancement of their activity.

Abstract: Summary
Most human genes are loaded with promoter-proximally paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) molecules that are poised for release into productive elongation by P-TEFb. We present evidence that Gdown1, the product of the POLR2M gene that renders Pol II responsive to Mediator, is involved in Pol II elongation control. During in vitro transcription, Gdown1 specifically blocked elongation stimulation by TFIIF, inhibited the termination activity of TTF2, and influenced pausing factors NELF and DSIF, but did not affect the function of TFIIS or the mRNA capping enzyme. Without P-TEFb, Gdown1 led to the production of stably paused polymerases in the presence of nuclear extract. Supporting these mechanistic insights, ChIP-Seq demonstrated that Gdown1 mapped over essentially all poised polymerases across the human genome. Our results establish that Gdown1 stabilizes poised polymerases while maintaining their responsiveness to P-TEFb and suggest that Mediator overcomes a Gdown1-mediated block of initiation by allowing TFIIF function.

Abstract: Summary
Lymphatic metastasis is facilitated by lymphangiogenic growth factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D that are secreted by some primary tumors. We identified regulation of PGDH, the key enzyme in prostaglandin catabolism, in endothelial cells of collecting lymphatics, as a key molecular change during VEGF-D-driven tumor spread. The VEGF-D-dependent regulation of the prostaglandin pathway was supported by the finding that collecting lymphatic vessel dilation and subsequent metastasis were affected by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), known inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis. Our data suggest a control point for cancer metastasis within the collecting lymphatic endothelium, which links VEGF-D/VEGFR-2/VEGFR-3 and the prostaglandin pathways. Collecting lymphatics therefore play an active and important role in metastasis and may provide a therapeutic target to restrict tumor spread.

Abstract: Agrobacterium tumefaciens is widely utilized for delivering a foreign gene into a plant’s genome. We found the bacterial transposon Tn5393 in transgenic rice plants. Analysis of the flanking sequences of the transferred-DNA (T-DNA) identified that a portion of the Tn5393 sequence was present immediately next to the end of the T-DNA. Because this transposon was present in A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404, but not in EHA105 and GV3101, our findings indicated that Tn5393 was transferred from LBA4404 into the rice genome during the transformation process. We also noted that another bacterial transposon, Tn5563, is present in transgenic plants. Analyses of 331 transgenic lines revealed that 26.0% carried Tn5393 and 2.1% contained Tn5563. In most of the lines, an intact transposon was integrated into the T-DNA and transferred to the rice chromosome. More than one copy of T-DNA was introduced into the plants, often at a single locus. This resulted in T-DNA repeats of normal and transposon-carrying T-DNA that generated deletions of a portion of the T-DNA, joining the T-DNA end to the bacterial transposon. Based on these data, we suggest that one should carefully select the appropriate Agrobacterium strain to avoid undesirable transformation of such sequences.

Abstract: Summary
Caveolin-1 is a major structural component of raft structures within the plasma membrane and has been implicated as a regulator of cellular signal transduction with prominent expression in adipocytes. Here, we embarked on a comprehensive characterization of the metabolic pathways dysregulated in caveolin-1 null mice. We found that these mice display decreased circulating levels of total and high molecular weight adiponectin and a reduced ability to change substrate use in response to feeding/fasting conditions. Caveolin-1 null mice are extremely lean but retain muscle mass despite lipodystrophy and massive metabolic dysfunction. Hepatic gluconeogenesis is chronically elevated, while hepatic steatosis is reduced. Our data suggest that the complex phenotype of the caveolin-1 null mouse is caused by altered metabolic and mitochondrial function in adipose tissue with a subsequent compensatory response driven mostly by the liver. This mouse model highlights the central contributions of adipose tissue for system-wide preservation of metabolic flexibility.

Abstract: Summary
The concept of “metabolic inflexibility” was first introduced to describe the failure of insulin-resistant human subjects to appropriately adjust mitochondrial fuel selection in response to nutritional cues. This phenomenon has since gained increasing recognition as a core component of the metabolic syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we identify an essential role for the mitochondrial matrix enzyme, carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT), in regulating substrate switching and glucose tolerance. By converting acetyl-CoA to its membrane permeant acetylcarnitine ester, CrAT regulates mitochondrial and intracellular carbon trafficking. Studies in muscle-specific Crat knockout mice, primary human skeletal myocytes, and human subjects undergoing L-carnitine supplementation support a model wherein CrAT combats nutrient stress, promotes metabolic flexibility, and enhances insulin action by permitting mitochondrial efflux of excess acetyl moieties that otherwise inhibit key regulatory enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase. These findings offer therapeutically relevant insights into the molecular basis of metabolic inflexibility.

Abstract: In most eukaryotic cells, microtubules and filamentous actin (F-actin) provide tracks on which intracellular organelles move using molecular motors. Here we report that cytoplasmic movement of both mitochondria and lysosomes is slowed by F-actin meshwork formation in pancreatic duct epithelial cells (PDEC). Mitochondria and lysosomes were labeled with fluorescent Mitotracker Red CMXRos and Lysotracker Red DND-99, respectively, and their movements were monitored using epi-fluorescence and confocal microscopy. Mitochondria and lysosomes moving actively at rest stopped rapidly within several seconds after an intracellular Ca2+ rise induced by activation of P2Y2 purinergic receptors. The ‘freezing’ of the organelles was inhibited by blocking the Ca2+ rise or by pretreatment with latrunculin B, an inhibitor of F-actin formation. Indeed, this freezing effect on the organelles was accompanied by the formation of F-actin in the whole cytoplasm as stained with Alexa 488-phalloidin in fixed PDEC. For real-time monitoring of F-actin formation in live cells, we expressed sGFP-fimbrin actin binding domain2 (fABD2) in PDEC. Rapid recruitment of the fluorescent probe near the nucleus and lysosomes suggested dense F-actin formation around intracellular structures. The development of F-actin paralleled that of organelle freezing. We conclude that rapid Ca2+-dependent F-actin formation physically restrains intracellular organelles and reduces their mobility non-selectively in PDEC.

Abstract: Summary
Alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate is a signature of cell division in metazoan cells, yet the mechanisms controlling this process remain ambiguous. Here we use a combination of quantitative live-cell imaging and reconstituted dynamic microtubule assays to investigate the molecular control of mitotic centromere movements. We establish that Kif18A (kinesin-8) attenuates centromere movement by directly promoting microtubule pausing in a concentration-dependent manner. This activity provides the dominant mechanism for restricting centromere movement to the spindle midzone. Furthermore, polar ejection forces spatially confine chromosomes via position-dependent regulation of kinetochore tension and centromere switch rates. We demonstrate that polar ejection forces are antagonistically modulated by chromokinesins. These pushing forces depend on Kid (kinesin-10) activity and are antagonized by Kif4A (kinesin-4), which functions to directly suppress microtubule growth. These data support a model in which Kif18A and polar ejection forces synergistically promote centromere alignment via spatial control of kinetochore-microtubule dynamics.

Abstract: The initial part of the ejaculatory duct of Orchesella villosa contains a “valve” and a “sorter” avoiding respectively the reflow and allowing the separation of the secretion for the spermatophore stalk from the sperm fluid. For most of its length, the ejaculatory duct lumen is divided into two parts: in the dorsal part the sperm fluid flows while in the ventral district the secretion for the stalk occurs. Laterally, on both sides of the duct, longitudinal muscle fibers are present. The epithelium of the dorsal region consists of two types of long secretory cells; the most peculiar of them are those provided with extracellular cisterns flowing directly into the duct lumen as it occurs in 1st type of epidermal cells. These cells could be involved in the control of the viscosity of the sperm fluid. The second type of cells produce a secretion probably involved in the formation of the outer coat of the apical sperm droplet. The ventral epithelium consists of short cells contributing to the enrichment of the secretion for the spermatophore stalk and perhaps also to the viscosity of the secretion flowing in the lumen. In the distal part of the ejaculatory duct, the ventral district is provided with a thick layer of muscle fibers and with 3+3 cuticular laminae dividing the lumen into a series of slits through which the secretion of the stalk is squeezed out into filaments. This organization allows the twisting and hardening of these filaments. A drop of sperm fluid is laid on top of the long and rigid spermatophore stalk.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations are typically perceived as random, independent events. We describe here nonrandom clustered mutations in yeast and in human cancers. Genome sequencing of yeast grown under chronic alkylation damage identified mutation clusters that extend up to 200 kb. A predominance of “strand-coordinated” changes of either cytosines or guanines in the same strand, mutation patterns, and genetic controls indicated that simultaneous mutations were generated by base alkylation in abnormally long single-strand DNA (ssDNA) formed at double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication forks. Significantly, we found mutation clusters with analogous features in sequenced human cancers. Strand-coordinated clusters of mutated cytosines or guanines often resided near chromosome rearrangement breakpoints and were highly enriched with a motif targeted by APOBEC family cytosine-deaminases, which strongly prefer ssDNA. These data indicate that hypermutation via multiple simultaneous changes in randomly formed ssDNA is a general phenomenon that may be an important mechanism producing rapid genetic variation.

Abstract: Summary
The prokaryotic clusters of regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system utilizes genomically encoded CRISPR RNA (crRNA), derived from invading viruses and incorporated into ribonucleoprotein complexes with CRISPR-associated (CAS) proteins, to target and degrade viral DNA or RNA on subsequent infection. RNA is targeted by the CMR complex. In Sulfolobus solfataricus, this complex is composed of seven CAS protein subunits (Cmr1-7) and carries a diverse “payload” of targeting crRNA. The crystal structure of Cmr7 and low-resolution structure of the complex are presented. S. solfataricus CMR cleaves RNA targets in an endonucleolytic reaction at UA dinucleotides. This activity is dependent on the 8 nt repeat-derived 5′ sequence in the crRNA, but not on the presence of a protospacer-associated motif (PAM) in the target. Both target and guide RNAs can be cleaved, although a single molecule of guide RNA can support the degradation of multiple targets.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark established by the combined actions of methylation and demethylation reactions. Plants use a base excision repair pathway for active DNA demethylation. After 5-methylcytosine removal, the Arabidopsis DNA glycosylase/lyase ROS1 incises the DNA backbone and part of the product has a single-nucleotide gap flanked by 3′- and 5′-phosphate termini. Here we show that the DNA phosphatase ZDP removes the blocking 3′ phosphate, allowing subsequent DNA polymerization and ligation steps needed to complete the repair reactions. ZDP and ROS1 interact in vitro and colocalize in vivo in nucleoplasmic foci. Extracts from zdp mutant plants are unable to complete DNA demethylation in vitro, and the mutations cause DNA hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of a reporter gene. Genome-wide methylation analysis in zdp mutant plants identified hundreds of hypermethylated endogenous loci. Our results show that ZDP functions downstream of ROS1 in one branch of the active DNA demethylation pathway.

Abstract: Cnu is a small 71-amino acid protein that complexes with H-NS and binds to a specific sequence in the replication origin of the E. coli chromosome. To understand the mechanism of interaction between Cnu and H-NS, we used bacterial genetics to select and analyze Cnu variants that cannot complex with H-NS. Out of 2,000 colonies, 40 Cnu variants were identified. Most variants (82.5%) had a single mutation, but a few variants (17.5%) had double amino acid changes. An in vitro assay was used to identify Cnu variants that were truly defective in H-NS binding. The changes in these defective variants occurred exclusively at charged amino acids (Asp, Glu, or Lys) on the surface of the protein. We propose that the attractive force that governs the Cnu-H-NS interaction is an ionic bond, unlike the hydrophobic interaction that is the major attractive force in most proteins.

Abstract: Glucose stimulation induces expression of the transcription factors Egr-1 and c-Jun as well as phosphorylation of CREB and c-Jun in insulinoma cells. The activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding sites within the c-Jun promoter, the serum response elements (SREs) within the Egr-1 promoter, and cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) function as glucose responsive element. Glucose-induced transcriptional regulation was attenuated by inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels, or chelating cytoplasmic Ca2+. It has been proposed that a rise in nuclear Ca2+ is required for CREB-mediated transcription of CRE-regulated genes, while elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels trigger an upregulation of SRE-containing genes. Here, we show that a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ is required for AP-1, CRE, and SRE mediated transcription in glucose-stimulated insulinoma cells. Buffering Ca2+ in the nucleus or the endoplasmic reticulum had no inhibitory effect upon transcription. However, overexpression of the mitochondrial protein Fis-1 or inhibition of the GTPase Drp-1 impaired glucose-stimulated gene transcription in insulinoma cells, suggesting that the mitochondria play an important role in regulating Ca2+ mediated gene transcription. The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase functions as an essential link connecting glucose stimulation, the rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+, and enhanced transcription in insulinoma cells.

Abstract: Summary
Knowledge of oncogenic mutations can inspire therapeutic strategies that are synthetically lethal, affecting cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Lenalidomide is an active agent in the activated B cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), but its mechanism of action is unknown. Lenalidomide kills ABC DLBCL cells by augmenting interferon β (IFNβ) production, owing to the oncogenic MYD88 mutations in these lymphomas. In a cereblon-dependent fashion, lenalidomide downregulates IRF4 and SPIB, transcription factors that together prevent IFNβ production by repressing IRF7 and amplify prosurvival NF-κB signaling by transactivating CARD11. Blockade of B cell receptor signaling using the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib also downregulates IRF4 and consequently synergizes with lenalidomide in killing ABC DLBCLs, suggesting attractive therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Ascorbic acid (AA) and β-glycerophosphate (βG) are considered in vitro osteogenic factors important to the differentiation of osteoblastic progenitor and dental pulp cells into mineralized tissue-forming cells. So, the present study investigated in vitro if these mineralizing inducible factors (AA and βG) could influence differentiation of human gingival fibroblasts when compared with human pulp cells and osteogenic cells derived from rat calvaria cultured. The expression of osteopontin (OPN) and osteoadherin (OSAD) was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry as well as Western-blotting. In addition, the main ultrastructural aspects were also investigated. No mineralized matrix formation occurred on gingival fibroblasts induced with AA+βG. On these cells, no expression of OPN and OSAD was observed when compared with pulp cells, pulp cells induced with AA+βG as well as osteogenic cells. Ultrastructure analysis additionally showed that gingival fibroblasts exhibited typical fibroblast morphology with no nodule formation. The present findings showed that AA and βG could not promote a mineralized cell differentiation of human gingival fibroblasts and confirm that human dental pulp cells, as the osteogenic cells, are capable to form a mineralized extracellular.

Abstract: Summary
Gradients of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induce single endothelial cells to become leading tip cells of emerging angiogenic sprouts. Tip cells then suppress tip-cell features in adjacent stalk cells via Dll4/Notch-mediated lateral inhibition. We report here that Smad1/Smad5-mediated BMP signaling synergizes with Notch signaling during selection of tip and stalk cells. Endothelium-specific inactivation of Smad1/Smad5 in mouse embryos results in impaired Dll4/Notch signaling and increased numbers of tip-cell-like cells at the expense of stalk cells. Smad1/5 downregulation in cultured endothelial cells reduced the expression of several target genes of Notch and of other stalk-cell-enriched transcripts (Hes1, Hey1, Jagged1, VEGFR1, and Id1-3). Moreover, Id proteins act as competence factors for stalk cells and form complexes with Hes1, which augment Hes1 levels in the endothelium. Our findings provide in vivo evidence for a regulatory loop between BMP/TGFβ-Smad1/5 and Notch signaling that orchestrates tip- versus stalk-cell selection and vessel plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Olfactory stimuli are detected by over 1,000 odorant receptors in mice, with each receptor being mapped to specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. The trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are a small family of evolutionarily conserved olfactory receptors whose contribution to olfaction remains enigmatic. Here, we show that a majority of the TAARs are mapped to a discrete subset of glomeruli in the dorsal olfactory bulb of the mouse. This TAAR projection is distinct from the previously described class I and class II domains, and is formed by a sensory neuron population that is restricted to express TAAR genes prior to choice. We also show that the dorsal TAAR glomeruli are selectively activated by amines at low concentrations. Our data uncover a hard-wired, parallel input stream in the main olfactory pathway that is specialized for the detection of volatile amines.

Abstract: Summary
Adult skeletal muscles adapt their fiber size to workload. We show that serum response factor (Srf) is required for satellite cell-mediated hypertrophic muscle growth. Deletion of Srf from myofibers and not satellite cells blunts overload-induced hypertrophy, and impairs satellite cell proliferation and recruitment to pre-existing fibers. We reveal a gene network in which Srf within myofibers modulates interleukin-6 and cyclooxygenase-2/interleukin-4 expressions and therefore exerts a paracrine control of satellite cell functions. In Srf-deleted muscles, in vivo overexpression of interleukin-6 is sufficient to restore satellite cell proliferation but not satellite cell fusion and overall growth. In contrast cyclooxygenase-2/interleukin-4 overexpression rescue satellite cell recruitment and muscle growth without affecting satellite cell proliferation, identifying altered fusion as the limiting cellular event. These findings unravel a role for Srf in the translation of mechanical cues applied to myofibers into paracrine signals, which in turn will modulate satellite cell functions and support muscle growth.

Abstract: Aiming to better understand folliculogenesis, this study evaluated cell death and proliferation of ovarian cells, besides cathepsin-D expression in Prochilodus argenteus captured in two sites of the São Francisco River downstream from the Três Marias Dam, Brazil. In the site immediately following the Dam (S1), low levels of dissolved oxygen were registered in the rainy period. The water temperature was higher in the São Francisco River immediately after the confluence with the Abaeté River (S2), regardless of the period. In S1, the ovaries showed smaller oocytes, high caspase-3 enzymatic activity and apoptosis, lower cells in proliferation and GSI, as well as a lesser quantity of cathepsin-D when compared to females captured from S2. Regarding relative frequency of ovarian structures, in the dry period, only oogonia and perinucleolar oocytes were found in fish ovaries from both sites. On the other hand, in the rainy period, the relative frequency of oogonia and perinucleolar oocytes decreased and the vitellogenic oocytes increased in S2. Postovulatory follicles were observed only in S2, whereas atretic follicles occurred at a higher frequency in S1. Our results showed that apoptosis, cell proliferation and cathepsina-D evaluation can be used as biomarkers of environmental impact.

Abstract: The DJ-1 superfamily (DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI superfamily) is distributed across all three kingdoms of life. These proteins are involved in a highly diverse range of cellular functions, including chaperone and protease activity. DJ-1 proteins usually form dimers or hexamers in vivo and show at least four different binding orientations via distinct interface patches. Abnormal oligomerization of human DJ-1 is related to neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease, suggesting important functional roles of quaternary structures. However, the quaternary structures of the DJ-1 superfamily have not been extensively studied. Here, we focus on the diverse oligomerization modes among the DJ-1 superfamily proteins and investigate the functional roles of quaternary structures both computationally and experimentally. The oligomerization modes are classified into 4 types (DJ-1, YhbO, Hsp, and YDR types) depending on the distinct interface patches (I-IV) upon dimerization. A unique, rotated interface via patch I is reported, which may potentially be related to higher order oligomerization. In general, the groups based on sequence similarity are consistent with the quaternary structural classes, but their biochemical functions cannot be directly inferred using sequence information alone. The observed phyletic pattern suggests the dynamic nature of quaternary structures in the course of evolution. The amino acid residues at the interfaces tend to show lower mutation rates than those of non-interfacial surfaces.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation activates the ATM kinase, which subsequently stabilizes and activates the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Although phosphorylation of p53 by ATM was found previously to modulate p53 levels and transcriptional activities in vivo, it does not appear to be a major regulator of p53 stability. We have utilized mice bearing altered Mdm2 alleles to demonstrate that ATM phosphorylation of Mdm2 serine 394 is required for robust p53 stabilization and activation after DNA damage. In addition, we demonstrate that dephosphorylation of Mdm2 Ser394 regulates attenuation of the p53-mediated response to DNA damage. Therefore, the phosphorylation status of Mdm2 Ser394 governs p53 protein levels and functions in cells undergoing DNA damage.

Abstract: Rap1 is rapidly and transiently activated in response to chemoattractant stimulation and helps establish cell polarity by locally modulating cytoskeletons. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which Rap1 controls actin cytoskeletal reorganization in Dictyostelium and found that Rap1 interacts with RacGEFI in vitro and stimulates Factin polymerization at the sites where Rap1 is activated upon chemoattractant stimulation. Live cell imaging using GFP-coronin, a reporter for F-actin, demonstrates that cells expressing constitutively active Rap1 (Rap1CA) exhibit a high level of F-actin uniformly distributed at the cortex including the posterior and lateral sides of the chemotaxing cell. Examination of the localization of a PH-domain containing PIP3 reporter, PhdA-GFP, and the activation of Akt/Pkb and other Ras proteins in Rap1CA cells reveals that activated Rap1 has no effect on the production of PIP3 or the activation of Akt/Pkb and Ras proteins in response to chemoattractant stimulation. Rac family proteins are crucial regulators in actin cytoskeletal reorganization. In vitro binding assay using truncated RacGEFI proteins shows that Rap1 interacts with the DH domain of RacGEFI. Taken together, these results suggest that Rapl-mediated F-actin polymerization probably occurs through the Rac signaling pathway by directly binding to RacGEFI.

Abstract: To identify specific biomarkers generated upon exposure of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells to carcinogens, 2-DE and MALDI-TOF MS analysis were conducted using the cellular proteome of L5178Y cells that had been treated with the known carcinogens, 1,2-dibromoethane and O- nitrotoluene and the noncarcinogens, emodin and D-mannitol. Eight protein spots that showed a greater than 1.5-fold increase or decrease in intensity following carcinogen treatment compared with treatment with noncarcinogens were selected. Of the identified proteins, we focused on the candidate biomarker ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), the expression of which was specifically increased in response to treatment with the carcinogens. The expression level of EBP50 was determined by western analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-EBP50 antibody. Further, the expression level of EBP50 was increased in cells treated with seven additional carcinogens, verifying that EBP50 could serve as a specific biomarker for carcinogens.

Abstract: Summary
The collapse of thymic stromal cell microenvironment with age and resultant inability of the thymus to produce naive T cells contributes to lower immune-surveillance in the elderly. Here we show that age-related increase in ‘lipotoxic danger signals’ such as free cholesterol (FC) and ceramides, leads to thymic caspase-1 activation via the Nlrp3 inflammasome. Elimination of Nlrp3 and Asc, a critical adaptor required for inflammasome assembly, reduces age-related thymic atrophy and results in an increase in cortical thymic epithelial cells, T cell progenitors and maintenance of T cell repertoire diversity. Using a mouse model of irradiation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), we show that deletion of the Nlrp3 inflammasome accelerates T cell reconstitution and immune recovery in middle-aged animals. Collectively, these data demonstrate that lowering inflammasome-dependent caspase-1 activation increases thymic lymphopoiesis and suggest that Nlrp3 inflammasome inhibitors may aid the re-establishment of a diverse T cell repertoire in middle-aged or elderly patients undergoing HSCT.

Abstract: Summary
α-helical integral membrane proteins critically depend on the correct insertion of their transmembrane α helices into the lipid bilayer for proper folding, yet a surprisingly large fraction of the transmembrane α helices in multispanning integral membrane proteins are not sufficiently hydrophobic to insert into the target membrane by themselves. How can such marginally hydrophobic segments nevertheless form transmembrane helices in the folded structure? Here, we show that a transmembrane helix with a strong orientational preference (Ncyt-Clum or Nlum-Ccyt) can both increase and decrease the hydrophobicity threshold for membrane insertion of a neighboring, marginally hydrophobic helix. This effect helps explain the “missing hydrophobicity” in polytopic membrane proteins.

Abstract: The secretion of adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) from corticotropes is a key component in the endocrine response to stress. The resting potential of corticotropes is set by the basal activities of TWIK-related K+ (TREK)-1 channel. Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), the major ACTH secretagogue, closes the background TREK-1 channels via the cAMP-dependent pathway, resulting in depolarization and a sustained rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i). By contrast, arginine vasopressin and norepinephrine evoke Ca2+ release from the inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive store, resulting in the activation of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels and hyperpolarization. Following [Ca2+]i rise, cytosolic Ca2+ is taken into the mitochondria via the uniporter. Mitochondrial inhibition slows the decay of the Ca2+ signal and enhances the depolarization-triggered exocytotic response. Both voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activation and intracellular Ca2+ release generate spatial Ca2+ gradients near the exocytic sites such that the local [Ca2+] is ∼3-fold higher than the average [Ca2+]i. The stimulation of mitochondrial metabolism during the agonist-induced Ca2+ signal and the robust endocytosis following stimulated exocytosis enable corticotropes to maintain sustained secretion during the diurnal ACTH surge. Arachidonic acid (AA) which is generated during CRH stimulation activates TREK-1 channels and causes hyperpolarization. Thus, corticotropes may regulate ACTH release via an autocrine feedback mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
The altered metabolism of tumors has been considered a target for anticancer therapy. However, the relationship between distinct tumor-initiating lesions and anomalies of tumor metabolism in vivo has not been addressed. We report that MYC-induced mouse liver tumors significantly increase both glucose and glutamine catabolism, whereas MET-induced liver tumors use glucose to produce glutamine. Increased glutamine catabolism in MYC-induced liver tumors is associated with decreased levels of glutamine synthetase (Glul) and the switch from Gls2 to Gls1 glutaminase. In contrast to liver tumors, MYC-induced lung tumors display increased expression of both Glul and Gls1 and accumulate glutamine. We also show that inhibition of Gls1 kills cells that overexpress MYC and catabolize glutamine. Our results suggest that the metabolic profiles of tumors are likely to depend on both the genotype and tissue of origin and have implications regarding the design of therapies targeting tumor metabolism.

Abstract: The hypothalamic-neurohypophysial system (HNS) controls diuresis and parturition through the release of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT). These neuropeptides are chiefly synthesized in hypothalamic magnocellular somata in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and are released into the blood stream from terminals in the neurohypophysis. These HNS neurons develop specific electrical activity (bursts) in response to various physiological stimuli. The release of AVP and OT at the level of neurohypophysis is directly linked not only to their different burst patterns, but is also regulated by the activity of a number of voltage-dependent channels present in the HNS nerve terminals and by feedback modulators. We found that there is a different complement of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) in the two types of HNS terminals: L, N, and Q in vasopressinergic terminals vs. L, N, and R in oxytocinergic terminals. These channels, however, do not have sufficiently distinct properties to explain the differences in release efficacy of the specific burst patterns. However, feedback by both opioids and ATP specifically modulate different types of VGCC and hence the amount of AVP and/or OT being released. Opioid receptors have been identified in both AVP and OT terminals. In OT terminals, μ-receptor agonists inhibit all VGCC (particularly R-type), whereas, they induce a limited block of L-, and P/Q-type channels, coupled to an unusual potentiation of the N-type Ca2+ current in the AVP terminals. In contrast, the N-type Ca2+ current can be inhibited by adenosine via A1 receptors leading to the decreased release of both AVP and OT. Furthermore, ATP evokes an inactivating Ca2+/Na+-current in HNS terminals able to potentiate AVP release through the activation of P2X2, P2X3, P2X4 and P2X7 receptors. In OT terminals, however, only the latter receptor type is probably present. We conclude by proposing a model that can explain how purinergic and/or opioid feedback modulation during bursts can mediate differences in the control of neurohypophysial AVP vs. OT release.

Sarcalumenin plays a critical role in age-related cardiac dysfunction due to decreases in SERCA2a expression and activity,

Abstract: Impaired Ca2+ reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) underlies a primary pathogenesis of heart failure in the aging heart. Sarcalumenin (SAR), a Ca2+-binding glycoprotein located in the longitudinal SR, regulates Ca2+ reuptake by interacting with SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). Here we found that the expression levels of both SAR and SERCA2 proteins were significantly downregulated in senescent wild-type mice (18-month old) and that downregulation of SAR protein preceded downregulation of SERCA2 protein. The downregulation of SERCA2 protein was greater in senescent SARKO mice than in age-matched senescent wild-type mice, which was at least in part due to progressive degradation of SERCA2 protein in SARKO mice. Senescent SARKO mice exhibited typical findings of heart failure such as increased sympathetic activity, impaired exercise tolerance, and upregulation of biomarkers of cardiac stress. Consequently, cardiac function was progressively decreased in senescent SARKO. We also found that the expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes such as x-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) were significantly increased in senescent SARKO mice, indicating that senescent SARKO mice exhibited ER stress. Thus we uncovered the important role of SAR in maintaining Ca2+ transport activity of SERCA2a and cardiac function in the senescent population.
