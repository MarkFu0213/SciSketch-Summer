Abstract: Summary
Many metabolism-related genes undergo alternative splicing to generate circular RNAs, but their functions remain poorly understood. Here we report that circPRKAA1, a circular RNA (circRNA) derived from the α1 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), fulfills a fundamental role in maintaining lipid homeostasis. circPRKAA1 expression facilitates fatty acid synthesis and promotes lipid storage through two coordinated functions. First, circPRKAA1 promotes a tetrameric complex between the Ku80/Ku70 heterodimer and the mature form of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (mSREBP-1) to enhance the stability of mSREBP-1. Second, circPRKAA1 selectively binds to the promoters of the ACC1, ACLY, SCD1, and FASN genes to recruit mSREBP-1, upregulating their transcription and increasing fatty acid synthesis to promote cancer growth. circPRKAA1 biogenesis is negatively regulated by AMPK activity, with lower AMPK activation in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue frequently associated with elevated circPRKAA1 expression. This work identifies circPRKAA1 as an integral element of AMPK-regulated reprogramming of lipid metabolism in cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
De novo beige adipocyte biogenesis involves the proliferation of progenitor cells in white adipose tissue (WAT); however, what regulates this process remains unclear. Here, we report that in mouse models but also in human tissues, WAT lipolysis-derived linoleic acid triggers beige progenitor cell proliferation following cold acclimation, β3-adrenoceptor activation, and burn injury. A subset of adipocyte progenitors, as marked by cell surface markers PDGFRα or Sca1 and CD81, harbored cristae-rich mitochondria and actively imported linoleic acid via a fatty acid transporter CD36. Linoleic acid not only was oxidized as fuel in the mitochondria but also was utilized for the synthesis of arachidonic acid-derived signaling entities such as prostaglandin D2. Oral supplementation of linoleic acid was sufficient to stimulate beige progenitor cell proliferation, even under thermoneutral conditions, in a CD36-dependent manner. Together, this study provides mechanistic insights into how diverse pathophysiological stimuli, such as cold and burn injury, promote de novo beige fat biogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
AKT is a central signaling protein kinase that plays a role in the regulation of cellular survival metabolism and cell growth, as well as in pathologies such as diabetes and cancer. Human AKT consists of three isoforms (AKT1–3) that may fulfill different functions. Here, we report that distinct subcellular localization of the isoforms directly influences their activity and function. AKT1 is localized primarily in the cytoplasm, AKT2 in the nucleus, and AKT3 in the nucleus or nuclear envelope. None of the isoforms actively translocates into the nucleus upon stimulation. Interestingly, AKT3 at the nuclear envelope is constitutively phosphorylated, enabling a constant phosphorylation of TSC2 at this location. Knockdown of AKT3 induces moderate attenuation of cell proliferation of breast cancer cells. We suggest that in addition to the stimulation-induced activation of the lysosomal/cytoplasmic AKT1-TSC2 pathway, a subpopulation of TSC2 is constitutively inactivated by AKT3 at the nuclear envelope of transformed cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cell lineage specification is accomplished by a concerted action of chromatin remodeling and tissue-specific transcription factors. However, the mechanisms that induce and maintain appropriate lineage-specific gene expression remain elusive. Here, we used an unbiased proteomics approach to characterize chromatin regulators that mediate the induction of neuronal cell fate. We found that Tip60 acetyltransferase is essential to establish neuronal cell identity partly via acetylation of the histone variant H2A.Z. Despite its tight correlation with gene expression and active chromatin, loss of H2A.Z acetylation had little effect on chromatin accessibility or transcription. Instead, loss of Tip60 and acetyl-H2A.Z interfered with H3K4me3 deposition and activation of a unique subset of silent, lineage-restricted genes characterized by a bivalent chromatin configuration at their promoters. Altogether, our results illuminate the mechanisms underlying bivalent chromatin activation and reveal that H2A.Z acetylation regulates neuronal fate specification by establishing epigenetic competence for bivalent gene activation and cell lineage transition.

Abstract: Summary
MYC is dysregulated in >50% of cancers, but direct targeting of MYC has been clinically unsuccessful. Targeting downstream MYC effector pathways represents an attractive alternative. MYC regulates alternative mRNA splicing, but the mechanistic links between MYC and the splicing machinery in cancer remain underexplored. Here, we identify a network of co-expressed splicing factors (SF-modules) in MYC-active breast tumors. Of these, one is a pan-cancer SF-module correlating with MYC activity across 33 tumor types. In mammary cell models, MYC activation leads to co-upregulation of pan-cancer module SFs and to changes in >4,000 splicing events. In breast cancer organoids, co-overexpression of the pan-cancer SF-module induces MYC-regulated splicing events and increases organoid size and invasiveness, while knockdown decreases organoid size. Finally, we uncover a MYC-activity pan-cancer splicing signature correlating with survival across tumor types. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms of MYC-regulated splicing and for the development of therapeutics for MYC-driven tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Steady-state extramedullary hematopoiesis during adulthood is an emerging field of great interest. The meninges contain both innate and adaptive immune cells, which provide immunosurveillance of the central nervous system (CNS). Hematopoietic progenitors that give rise to meningeal immune cells remain elusive. Here, we report that steady-state meninges of adult mice host hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as defined by long-term, efficient, multi-lineage reconstitution and self-renewal capacity in the meninges, blood, spleen, and bone marrow of sublethally irradiated adult recipients. HSCs lodge in the meninges after birth with local expression of pro-hematopoietic niche factors. Meningeal HSCs are locally maintained in homeostasis and get replenished from the blood only when the resident pool is reduced. With a tissue-specific expression profile, meningeal HSCs can provide the CNS with a constant supply of leukocytes more adapted to local microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Efflux is a common mechanism of resistance to antibiotics. We show that efflux itself promotes accumulation of antibiotic-resistance mutations (ARMs). This phenomenon was initially discovered in a bacterial swarm where the linked phenotypes of high efflux and high mutation frequencies spatially segregated to the edge, driven there by motility. We have uncovered and validated a global regulatory network connecting high efflux to downregulation of specific DNA-repair pathways even in non-swarming states. The efflux-DNA repair link was corroborated in a clinical “resistome” database: genomes with mutations that increase efflux exhibit a significant increase in ARMs. Accordingly, efflux inhibitors decreased evolvability to antibiotic resistance. Swarms also revealed how bacterial populations serve as a reservoir of ARMs even in the absence of antibiotic selection pressure. High efflux at the edge births mutants that, despite compromised fitness, survive there because of reduced competition. This finding is relevant to biofilms where efflux activity is high.

Abstract: Summary
CD74 is receptor for the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF binding to CD74 induces a signaling cascade resulting in the release of its cytosolic intracellular domain (CD74-ICD) that serves as a transcriptional regulator in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. In the current study, we investigated the transcriptional and regulatory function of CD74-ICD in normal B cells. We show that following activation, CD74-ICD forms a complex in the cytosol with transcription factors, like PAX5, and binds the chromatin at a significantly higher number of sites compared with its binding in CLL cells. The expression of a major portion of these bound genes is shut down in the malignant cells. The CD74-ICD:PAX5 complex binds the promoter areas of a tumor-suppressor gene, DMTF1, and downregulates its expression through inhibition of transcription. These findings can help identify novel therapeutic pathways that are regulated during oncogenic transformation and are targets for future treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Polymerase theta (POLθ) is an error-prone DNA polymerase whose loss is synthetically lethal in cancer cells bearing breast cancer susceptibility proteins 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) mutations. To investigate the basis of this genetic interaction, we utilized a small-molecule inhibitor targeting the POLθ polymerase domain. We found that POLθ processes single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps that emerge in the absence of BRCA1, thus promoting unperturbed replication fork progression and survival of BRCA1 mutant cells. A genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen uncovered suppressors of the functional interaction between POLθ and BRCA1, including NBN, a component of the MRN complex, and cell-cycle regulators such as CDK6. While the MRN complex nucleolytically processes ssDNA gaps, CDK6 promotes cell-cycle progression, thereby exacerbating replication stress, a feature of BRCA1-deficient cells that lack POLθ activity. Thus, ssDNA gap formation, modulated by cell-cycle regulators and MRN complex activity, underlies the synthetic lethality between POLθ and BRCA1, an important insight for clinical trials with POLθ inhibitors.

Neuronal-epithelial cross-talk drives acinar specification via NRG1-ERBB3-mTORC2 signaling,

Abstract: Summary
Acinar cells are the principal secretory units of multiple exocrine organs. A single-cell, layered, lumenized acinus forms from a large cohort of epithelial progenitors that must initiate and coordinate three cellular programs of acinar specification, namely, lineage progression, secretion, and polarization. Despite this well-known outcome, the mechanism(s) that regulate these complex programs are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that neuronal-epithelial cross-talk drives acinar specification through neuregulin (NRG1)-ERBB3-mTORC2 signaling. Using single-cell and global RNA sequencing of developing murine salivary glands, we identified NRG1-ERBB3 to precisely overlap with acinar specification during gland development. Genetic deletion of Erbb3 prevented cell lineage progression and the establishment of lumenized, secretory acini. Conversely, NRG1 treatment of isolated epithelia was sufficient to recapitulate the development of secretory acini. Mechanistically, we found that NRG1-ERBB3 regulates each developmental program through an mTORC2 signaling pathway. Thus, we reveal that a neuronal-epithelial (NRG1/ERBB3/mTORC2) mechanism orchestrates the creation of functional acini.

Abstract: Summary
Tendon injuries heal via a scar-mediated response, and there are no biological approaches to promote more regenerative healing. Mouse flexor tendons heal through the formation of spatially distinct tissue areas: a highly aligned tissue bridge between the native tendon stubs that is enriched for adult Scleraxis-lineage cells and a disorganized outer shell associated with peri-tendinous scar formation. However, the specific molecular programs that underpin these spatially distinct tissue profiles are poorly defined. In the present study, we combine lineage tracing of adult Scleraxis-lineage cells with spatial transcriptomic profiling to define the overarching molecular programs that govern tendon healing and cell-fate decisions. Pseudotime analysis identified three fibroblast trajectories (synthetic, fibrotic, and reactive) and key transcription factors regulating these fate-switching decisions, including the progression of adult Scleraxis-lineage cells through the reactive trajectory. Collectively, this resource defines the molecular mechanisms that coordinate the temporo-spatial healing phenotype, which can be leveraged to inform therapeutic candidate selection.

Abstract: Summary
SHH subgroup medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) is one of the most common malignant pediatric tumors that arises in the cerebellum. Previously, we showed that RNA m6A methylation participates in regulation of cerebellar development. Here we investigate whether dysregulated m6A methylation contributes to tumorigenesis of SHH-MB. We show that high expression of m6A methyltransferase METTL3 associates with worse survival in the patients with SHH-MB. A large number of hypermethylated transcripts are identified in SHH-MB tumor cells by m6A-seq. We find that METTL3 promotes tumor progression via activating Sonic hedgehog signaling. Mechanistically, METTL3 methylates PTCH1 and GLI2 RNAs and further regulates their RNA stability and translation. Importantly, targeting METTL3 by depleting METTL3 expression or treatment with its catalytic inhibitor STM2457 restrains tumor progression. Collectively, this study shows a critical function for METTL3 and m6A methylation in SHH-MB, indicative of a potential role of METTL3 as therapeutic target in SHH-MB.

Abstract: Summary
The presence of BRAFV600E in colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with a higher chance of distant metastasis. Oxidative stress in disseminated tumor cells limits metastatic capacity. To study the relationship between BRAFV600E, sensitivity to oxidative stress, and metastatic capacity in CRC, we use patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and tissue samples. BRAFV600E tumors and PDOs express high levels of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. Deletion of GCL in BRAFV600E PDOs strongly reduces their capacity to form distant liver and lung metastases but does not affect peritoneal metastasis outgrowth. Vice versa, the glutathione precursor N-acetyl-cysteine promotes organ-site-specific metastasis in the liver and the lungs but not in the peritoneum. BRAFV600E confers resistance to pharmacologically induced oxidative stress in vitro, which is partially overcome by treatment with the BRAF-inhibitor vemurafenib. We conclude that GCL-driven glutathione synthesis protects BRAFV600E-expressing tumors from oxidative stress during distant metastasis to the liver and the lungs.

Abstract: Summary
Adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) play key roles in a diversity of physiologies. A hallmark of aGPCR activation is the removal of the inhibitory GAIN domain and the dipping of the cleaved stalk peptide into the ligand-binding pocket of receptors; however, the detailed mechanism remains obscure. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of ADGRL3 in complex with Gq, Gs, Gi, and G12. The structures reveal unique ligand-engaging mode, distinctive activation conformation, and key mechanisms of aGPCR activation. The structures also reveal the uncharted structural information of GPCR/G12 coupling. A comparison of Gq, Gs, Gi, and G12 engagements with ADGRL3 reveals the key determinant of G-protein coupling on the far end of αH5 of Gα. A detailed analysis of the engagements allows us to design mutations that specifically enhance one pathway over others. Taken together, our study lays the groundwork for understanding aGPCR activation and G-protein-coupling selectivity.

Abstract: Summary
POLθ promotes repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) resulting from collapsed forks in homologous recombination (HR) defective tumors. Inactivation of POLθ results in synthetic lethality with the loss of HR genes BRCA1/2, which induces under-replicated DNA accumulation. However, it is unclear whether POLθ-dependent DNA replication prevents HR-deficiency-associated lethality. Here, we isolated Xenopus laevis POLθ and showed that it processes stalled Okazaki fragments, directly visualized by electron microscopy, thereby suppressing ssDNA gaps accumulating on lagging strands in the absence of RAD51 and preventing fork reversal. Inhibition of POLθ DNA polymerase activity leaves fork gaps unprotected, enabling their cleavage by the MRE11-NBS1-CtIP endonuclease, which produces broken forks with asymmetric single-ended DSBs, hampering BRCA2-defective cell survival. These results reveal a POLθ-dependent genome protection function preventing stalled forks rupture and highlight possible resistance mechanisms to POLθ inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with Crohn’s disease (CD), but its impact on host-microbe interaction in disease pathogenesis is not well defined. Functional deficiency in the protein disulfide isomerase anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) has been linked with CD and leads to epithelial cell ER stress and ileocolitis in mice and humans. Here, we show that ileal expression of AGR2 correlates with mucosal Enterobactericeae abundance in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and that Agr2 deletion leads to ER-stress-dependent expansion of mucosal-associated adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), which drives Th17 cell ileocolitis in mice. Mechanistically, our data reveal that AIEC-induced epithelial cell ER stress triggers CD103+ dendritic cell production of interleukin-23 (IL-23) and that IL-23R is required for ileocolitis in Agr2−/− mice. Overall, these data reveal a specific and reciprocal interaction of the expansion of the CD pathobiont AIEC with ER-stress-associated ileocolitis and highlight a distinct cellular mechanism for IL-23-dependent ileocolitis.

Abstract: Although asthma is a common chronic airway disease that responds well to anti-inflammatory agents, some patients with asthma are unresponsive to conventional treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have therapeutic potential for the treatment of inflammatory diseases owing to their immunomodulatory properties. However, the target cells of MSCs are not yet clearly known. This study aimed to determine the effect of human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (hUC-MSCs) on asthmatic lungs by modulating innate immune cells and effector T cells using a murine asthmatic model. Intravenously administered hUC-MSCs reduced airway resistance, mucus production, and inflammation in the murine asthma model. hUC-MSCs attenuated not only T helper (Th) 2 cells and Th17 cells but also augmented regulatory T cells (Tregs). As for innate lymphoid cells (ILC), hUC-MSCs effectively suppressed ILC2s by downregulating master regulators of ILC2s, such as Gata3 and Tcf7. Finally, regarding lung macrophages, hUC-MSCs reduced the total number of macrophages, particularly the proportion of the enhanced monocyte-derived macrophage population. In a closer examination of monocyte-derived macrophages, hUC-MSCs reduced the M2a and M2c populations. In conclusion, hUC-MSCs can be considered as a potential anti-asthmatic treatment given their therapeutic effect on the asthmatic airway inflammation in a murine asthma model by modulating innate immune cells, such as ILC2s, M2a, and M2c macrophages, as well as affecting Tregs and effector T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Epileptic networks are characterized as having two states, seizures or more prolonged interictal periods. However, cellular mechanisms underlying the contribution of interictal periods to ictal events remain unclear. Here, we use an activity-dependent labeling technique combined with genetically encoded effectors to characterize and manipulate neuronal ensembles recruited by focal seizures (FS-Ens) and interictal periods (IP-Ens) in piriform cortex, a region that plays a key role in seizure generation. Ca2+ activities and histological evidence reveal a disjointed correlation between the two ensembles during FS dynamics. Optogenetic activation of FS-Ens promotes further seizure development, while IP-Ens protects against it. Interestingly, both ensembles are functionally involved in generalized seizures (GS) due to circuit rearrangement. IP-Ens bidirectionally modulates FS but not GS by controlling coherence with hippocampus. This study indicates that the interictal state may represent a seizure-preventing environment, and the interictal-activated ensemble may serve as a potential therapeutic target for epilepsy.

Abstract: Summary
Many human diseases are caused by mutations in nuclear envelope (NE) proteins. How protein homeostasis and disease etiology are interconnected at the NE is poorly understood. Specifically, the identity of local ubiquitin ligases that facilitate ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent NE protein turnover is presently unknown. Here, we employ a short-lived, Lamin B receptor disease variant as a model substrate in a genetic screen to uncover key elements of NE protein turnover. We identify the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) Ube2G2 and Ube2D3, the membrane-resident ubiquitin ligases (E3s) RNF5 and HRD1, and the poorly understood protein TMEM33. RNF5, but not HRD1, requires TMEM33 both for efficient biosynthesis and function. Once synthesized, RNF5 responds dynamically to increased substrate levels at the NE by departing from the endoplasmic reticulum, where HRD1 remains confined. Thus, mammalian protein quality control machinery partitions between distinct cellular compartments to address locally changing substrate loads, establishing a robust cellular quality control system.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleolar surveillance pathway monitors nucleolar integrity and responds to nucleolar stress by mediating binding of ribosomal proteins to MDM2, resulting in p53 accumulation. Inappropriate pathway activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of ribosomopathies, while drugs selectively activating the pathway are in trials for cancer. Despite this, the molecular mechanism(s) regulating this process are poorly understood. Using genome-wide loss-of-function screens, we demonstrate the ribosome biogenesis axis as the most potent class of genes whose disruption stabilizes p53. Mechanistically, we identify genes critical for regulation of this pathway, including HEATR3. By selectively disabling the nucleolar surveillance pathway, we demonstrate that it is essential for the ability of all nuclear-acting stresses, including DNA damage, to induce p53 accumulation. Our data support a paradigm whereby the nucleolar surveillance pathway is the central integrator of stresses that regulate nuclear p53 abundance, ensuring that ribosome biogenesis is hardwired to cellular proliferative capacity.

Abstract: Summary
During pandemics, individuals exhibit differences in risk and clinical outcomes. Here, we developed single-cell high-throughput human in vitro susceptibility testing (scHi-HOST), a method for rapidly identifying genetic variants that confer resistance and susceptibility. We applied this method to influenza A virus (IAV), the cause of four pandemics since the start of the 20th century. scHi-HOST leverages single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to simultaneously assign genetic identity to cells in mixed infections of cell lines of European, African, and Asian origin, reveal associated genetic variants for viral burden, and identify expression quantitative trait loci. Integration of scHi-HOST with human challenge and experimental validation demonstrated that a missense variant in endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1; rs27895) increased IAV burden in cells and human volunteers. rs27895 exhibits population differentiation, likely contributing to greater permissivity of cells from African populations to IAV. scHi-HOST is a broadly applicable method and resource for decoding infectious-disease genetics.

Abstract: Summary
The primary cilium, a microtubule-based sensory organelle, undergoes cycles of assembly and disassembly that govern the cell cycle progression critical to cell proliferation and differentiation. Although cilia assembly has been studied extensively, the molecular mechanisms underlying cilia disassembly are less well understood. Here, we uncover a γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC)-dependent pathway that promotes cilia disassembly and thereby prevents cilia formation. We further demonstrate that Kif2A, a kinesin motor that bears microtubule-depolymerizing activity, is recruited to the cilium basal body in a γ-TuRC-dependent manner. Our mechanistic analyses show that γ-TuRC specifically recruits Kif2A via the GCP2 subunit and its binding partner Mzt2. Hence, despite the long-standing view that γ-TuRC acts mainly as a microtubule template, we illustrate that its functional heterogeneity at the basal body facilitates both microtubule nucleation and Kif2A recruitment-mediated regulation of ciliogenesis, ensuring cell cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism is related to tumorigenesis. However, the underlying mechanism and specific contexts in which BCAAs affect tumor progression remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that BCAA catabolism is activated in liver cancer cells without glutamine. Enhanced BCAA catabolism leads to BCAA-derived carbon and nitrogen flow toward nucleotide synthesis, stimulating cell-cycle progression and promoting cell survival. Mechanistically, O-GlcNAcylation increases under glutamine-deprivation conditions and stabilizes the PPM1K protein, leading to dephosphorylation of BCKDHA and enhanced decomposition of BCAAs. Dephosphorylation of BCKDHA and high expression of PPM1K promote tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo and are closely related to the poor prognosis of clinical patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Inhibition of BCAA and glutamine metabolism can further retard HCC growth in vivo. These results not only elucidate a mechanism by which BCAA catabolism affects tumorigenesis but also identify pBCKDHA and PPM1K as potential therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms underlying spontaneous locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. Using adult zebrafish with complete SCI, we show that V2a interneurons regrow their axon to bridge the lesioned spinal segments in a subclass-specific and chronological order. Early after SCI, reestablishment of a unitary high-rhythm locomotor circuit is driven merely by axon-regrown fast V2a interneurons. Later, the reestablished intraspinal de novo circuit is organized into a modular design by axon-regrown fast and slow V2a interneurons rostral to the lesion, selectively driving caudal fast V2a/motor neurons and slow V2a/motor neurons, respectively. This orderly circuitry reestablishment determines the stepwise restoration of locomotor repertoire and recapitulates developmental processes. This progress can be interrupted by ablation of calretinin, a fast module-related protein, and accelerated by physical training. These findings suggest that promotion of axon regrowth of propriospinal V2a interneurons and establishment of de novo intraspinal circuits underpin the effectiveness of physical training in patients after SCI.

Abstract: Summary
24 h whole-body substrate metabolism and the circadian clock within skeletal muscle are both compromised upon metabolic disease in humans. Here, we assessed the 24 h muscle metabolome by serial muscle sampling performed under 24 h real-life conditions in young, healthy (YH) men versus older, metabolically compromised (OMC) men. We find that metabolites associated with the initial steps of glycolysis and hexosamine biosynthesis are higher in OMC men around the clock, whereas metabolites associated with glutamine-alpha-ketoglutarate, ketone, and redox metabolism are lower in OMC men. The night period shows the largest number of differently expressed metabolites. Both groups demonstrate 24 h rhythmicity in half of the metabolome, but rhythmic metabolites only partially overlap. Specific metabolites are only rhythmic in YH men (adenosine), phase shifted in OMC men (cis-aconitate, flavin adenine dinucleotide [FAD], and uridine diphosphate [UDP]), or have a reduced 24 h amplitude in OMC men (hydroxybutyrate and hippuric acid). Our data highlight the plasticity of the skeletal muscle metabolome over 24 h and large divergence across the metabolic health spectrum.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial dysfunction, a hallmark of aging, has been associated with the onset of aging phenotypes and age-related diseases. Here, we report that impaired mitochondrial function is associated with increased glutamine catabolism in senescent human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and myofibroblasts derived from patients suffering from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Increased glutaminase (GLS1) activity accompanied by loss of urea transporter SLC14A1 induces urea accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. Conversely, blocking GLS1 activity restores mitochondrial function and leads to amelioration of aging hallmarks. Interestingly, GLS1 expression is regulated through the JNK pathway, as demonstrated by chemical and genetic inhibition. In agreement with our in vitro findings, tissues isolated from aged or progeria mice display increased urea accumulation and GLS1 activity, concomitant with declined mitochondrial function. Inhibition of glutaminolysis in progeria mice improves mitochondrial respiratory chain activity, suggesting that targeting glutaminolysis may be a promising strategy for restoring age-associated loss of mitochondrial function.

Abstract: Summary
A complete understanding of the genetic determinants underlying mammalian physiology and disease is limited by the capacity for high-throughput genetic dissection in the living organism. Genome-wide CRISPR screening is a powerful method for uncovering the genetic regulation of cellular processes, but the need to stably deliver single guide RNAs to millions of cells has largely restricted its implementation to ex vivo systems. There thus remains a need for accessible high-throughput functional genomics in vivo. Here, we establish genome-wide screening in the liver of a single mouse and use this approach to uncover regulation of hepatocyte fitness. We uncover pathways not identified in cell culture screens, underscoring the power of genetic dissection in the organism. The approach we developed is accessible, scalable, and adaptable to diverse phenotypes and applications. We have hereby established a foundation for high-throughput functional genomics in a living mammal, enabling comprehensive investigation of physiology and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome biogenesis takes place in the nucleolus, a nuclear membrane-less organelle. Although well studied, it remains unknown how nascent ribosomal subunits separate from the central chromatin compartment and move to the outer granular component, where maturation occurs. We find that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe nucleophosmin-like protein Fkbp39 localizes to rDNA sites encoding the 60S subunit rRNA, and this localization contributes to its specific association with nascent 60S subunits. Fkbp39 dissociates from chromatin to bind nascent 60S subunits, causing the latter to partition away from chromatin and from nascent 40S subunits through liquid-liquid phase separation. In vivo, Fkbp39 binding directs the translocation of nascent 60S subunits toward the nucleophosmin-rich granular component. This process increases the efficiency of 60S subunit assembly, facilitating the incorporation of 60S RNA domain III. Thus, chromatin localization determines the specificity of nucleophosmin in sorting nascent ribosomal subunits and coordinates their movement into specialized assembly compartments within the nucleolus.

Abstract: Summary
The lack of T cell infiltrates is a major obstacle to effective immunotherapy in cancer. Conversely, the formation of tumor-associated tertiary-lymphoid-like structures (TA-TLLSs), which are the local site of humoral and cellular immune responses against cancers, is associated with good prognosis, and they have recently been detected in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-responding patients. However, how these lymphoid aggregates develop remains poorly understood. By employing single-cell transcriptomics, endothelial fate mapping, and functional multiplex immune profiling, we demonstrate that antiangiogenic immune-modulating therapies evoke transdifferentiation of postcapillary venules into inflamed high-endothelial venules (HEVs) via lymphotoxin/lymphotoxin beta receptor (LT/LTβR) signaling. In turn, tumor HEVs boost intratumoral lymphocyte influx and foster permissive lymphocyte niches for PD1− and PD1+TCF1+ CD8 T cell progenitors that differentiate into GrzB+PD1+ CD8 T effector cells. Tumor-HEVs require continuous CD8 and NK cell-derived signals revealing that tumor HEV maintenance is actively sculpted by the adaptive immune system through a feed-forward loop.

Abstract: This study mainly analyzed the relationship between nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ1)/Smad under high glucose environment and its influence on wound healing. Fibroblast NIH-3T3 was used to analyze the effect of high concentration glucose (20 nmol/mL) on cell viability, migration ability, inflammation level and NF-κB pathway. Pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) was used to inhibit NF-κB for rescue experiments. Diabetic mice were used to construct wound healing models. Recombinant TGF-β1 was used to promote wound healing in diabetic mice. FSL-1 was applied to activate NF-κB to verify the mechanism. High glucose inhibited cell viability and migration ability, promoted the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, induced the activation of NF-κB pathway in fibroblasts. Inhibition of NF-κB not only blocked the decrease in cell viability and migration ability induced by high glucose, but also relieved the release of inflammatory factors. TGF-β1 activated the TGF-β1/Smad pathway and promoted wound healing in diabetic mice. Activating the NF-κB pathway not only inhibited the activation of the TGF-β1/Smad pathway, but also alleviated the promoting effect of TGF-β1 on wound healing. In a high glucose environment, the activation of NF-κB may inhibit the function of fibroblasts by inhibiting the TGF-β1/Smad pathway, resulting in poor wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
Precise organ size control is fundamental for all metazoans, but how organ size is controlled in a three-dimensional (3D) way remains largely unexplored at the molecular level. Here, we screen and identify Drosophila Ptp61F as a pivotal regulator of organ size that integrates the Hippo pathway, TOR pathway, and actomyosin machinery. Pathologically, Ptp61F loss synergizes with RasV12 to induce tumorigenesis. Physiologically, Ptp61F depletion increases body size and drives neoplastic intestinal tumor formation and stem cell proliferation. Ptp61F also regulates cell contractility and myosin activation and controls 3D cell shape by reducing cell height and horizontal cell size. Mechanistically, Ptp61F forms a complex with Expanded (Ex) and increases endosomal localization of Ex and Yki. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PTPN2, the conserved human ortholog of Ptp61F, can functionally substitute for Ptp61F in Drosophila. Our work defines Ptp61F as an essential determinant that controls 3D organ size under both physiological and pathological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-type-specific gene regulatory programs are essential for cell differentiation and function. In animal neurons, the highly conserved ELAV/Hu family of proteins promotes alternative splicing and polyadenylation of mRNA precursors to create unique neuronal transcript isoforms. Here, we assess transcriptome profiles and neurogenesis success in Drosophila models engineered to express differing levels of ELAV activity in the course of development. We show that the ELAV-mediated establishment of a subset of neuronal mRNA isoforms at the onset of neuron differentiation constitutes a developmental bottleneck that cannot be overcome later by the nuclear activation of the paralog found in neurons (FNE). Loss of ELAV function outside of that critical time window results in neurological defects. We find that FNE, when activated early enough, can restore ELAV-dependent neuronal mRNA isoforms and fully rescue development. Our findings demonstrate the essential role of robust cellular strategies to maintain ELAV activity and intact neuronal signatures in neurogenesis and neuronal function.

Abstract: Summary
Collective cell movements drive normal development and metastasis. Drosophila border cells move as a cluster of 6–10 cells, where the role of the Rac GTPase in migration was first established. In border cells, as in most migratory cells, Rac stimulates leading-edge protrusion. Upstream Rac regulators in leaders have been identified; however, the regulation and function of Rac in follower border cells is unknown. Here, we show that all border cells require Rac, which promotes follower-cell motility and is important for cluster compactness and movement. We identify a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Cdep, which also regulates follower-cell movement and cluster cohesion. Scribble, Discs large, and Lethal giant larvae localize Cdep basolaterally and share phenotypes with Cdep. Relocalization of Cdep::GFP partially rescues Scribble knockdown, suggesting that Cdep is a major downstream effector of basolateral proteins. Thus, a Scrib/Cdep/Rac pathway promotes cell crawling and coordinated, collective migration in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Disorganization of the basic contractile unit of muscle cells, i.e., the sarcomeres, leads to suboptimal force generation and is a hallmark of muscle atrophy. Here, we demonstrate that the nuclear role of SENP7 deSUMOylase is pivotal for sarcomere organization. SENP7 expression is temporally upregulated in mature muscle cells and directly regulates transcription of the myosin heavy chain (MyHC-IId) gene. We identify SENP7-dependent deSUMOylation of flightless-1 (Fli-I) as a signal for Fli-I association with scaffold attachment factor b1 (Safb1). SENP7 deficiency leads to higher Fli-I SUMOylation and lower chromatin residency of Safb1, thus generating transcriptionally incompetent chromatin conformation on MyHC-IId. Consequently, lower expression of MyHC-IId causes sarcomere disorganization and disrupted muscle cell contraction. Remarkably, cachexia signaling impedes the SENP7-governed transcriptional program, leading to muscle atrophy, with profound loss of motor protein MyHC-IId. We propose a SENP7-driven distinct transcription program as paramount for muscle cell function, which was found targeted in cachexia.

Abstract: Summary
The endosomal-lysosomal system is a series of organelles in the endocytic pathway that executes trafficking and degradation of proteins and lipids and mediates the internalization of nutrients and growth factors to ensure cell survival, growth, and differentiation. Here, we reveal regulatory, non-proteolytic ubiquitin signals in this complex system that are controlled by the enigmatic deubiquitinase USP32. Knockout (KO) of USP32 in primary hTERT-RPE1 cells results among others in hyperubiquitination of the Ragulator complex subunit LAMTOR1. Accumulation of LAMTOR1 ubiquitination impairs its interaction with the vacuolar H+-ATPase, reduces Ragulator function, and ultimately limits mTORC1 recruitment. Consistently, in USP32 KO cells, less mTOR kinase localizes to lysosomes, mTORC1 activity is decreased, and autophagy is induced. Furthermore, we demonstrate that depletion of USP32 homolog CYK-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans results in mTOR inhibition and autophagy induction. In summary, we identify a control mechanism of the mTORC1 activation cascade at lysosomes via USP32-regulated LAMTOR1 ubiquitination.

Abstract: Summary
Platinum (Pt) compounds such as oxaliplatin are among the most commonly prescribed anti-cancer drugs. Despite their considerable clinical impact, the molecular basis of platinum cytotoxicity and cancer specificity remain unclear. Here we show that oxaliplatin, a backbone for the treatment of colorectal cancer, causes liquid-liquid demixing of nucleoli at clinically relevant concentrations. Our data suggest that this biophysical defect leads to cell-cycle arrest, shutdown of Pol I-mediated transcription, and ultimately cell death. We propose that instead of targeting a single molecule, oxaliplatin preferentially partitions into nucleoli, where it modifies nucleolar RNA and proteins. This mechanism provides a general approach for drugging the increasing number of cellular processes linked to biomolecular condensates.

Abstract: Summary
In both humans and mice, repair of acute kidney injury is worse in males than in females. Here, we provide evidence that this sexual dimorphism results from sex differences in ferroptosis, an iron-dependent, lipid-peroxidation-driven regulated cell death. Using genetic and single-cell transcriptomic approaches in mice, we report that female sex confers striking protection against ferroptosis, which was experimentally induced in proximal tubular (PT) cells by deleting glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4). Single-cell transcriptomic analyses further identify the NFE2-related factor 2 (NRF2) antioxidant protective pathway as a female resilience mechanism against ferroptosis. Genetic inhibition and pharmacological activation studies show that NRF2 controls PT cell fate and plasticity by regulating ferroptosis. Importantly, pharmacological NRF2 activation protects male PT cells from ferroptosis and improves cellular plasticity as in females. Our data highlight NRF2 as a potential therapeutic target to prevent failed renal repair after acute kidney injury in both sexes by modulating cellular plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
The age-related loss of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is at the heart of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, finding ways to preserve proteome integrity in aged cells may be a powerful way to promote long-term health. Here, we show that reducing the activity of a highly conserved mitochondrial outer membrane protein, MTCH-1/MTCH2, suppresses age-related proteostasis collapse in Caenorhabditis elegans without disrupting development, growth, or reproduction. Loss of MTCH-1 does not influence proteostasis capacity in aged tissues through previously described pathways but instead operates by reducing CED-4 levels. This results in the sequestration of HSP-90 by inactive CED-3, which in turn leads to an increase in HSF-1 activity, transcriptional remodeling of the proteostasis network, and maintenance of proteostasis capacity with age. Together, our findings reveal a role for programmed cell death factors in determining proteome health and suggest that inhibiting MTCH-1 activity in adulthood may safeguard the aging proteome and suppress age-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) can eliminate HIV-1-infected cells via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and were identified as a correlate of protection in the RV144 vaccine trial. Fc-mediated effector functions of nnAbs were recently shown to alter the course of HIV-1 infection in vivo using a vpu-defective virus. Since Vpu is known to downregulate cell-surface CD4, which triggers conformational changes in the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env), we ask whether the lack of Vpu expression was linked to the observed nnAbs activity. We find that restoring Vpu expression greatly reduces nnAb recognition of infected cells, rendering them resistant to ADCC. Moreover, administration of nnAbs in humanized mice reduces viral loads only in animals infected with a vpu-defective but not with a wild-type virus. CD4-mimetics administration, known to “open” Env and expose nnAb epitopes, renders wild-type viruses sensitive to nnAbs Fc-effector functions. This work highlights the importance of Vpu-mediated evasion of humoral responses.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammatory monocytes (iMOs) and B cells are the main targets of the poxvirus ectromelia virus (ECTV) in the lymph nodes of mice and play distinct roles in surviving the infection. Infected and bystander iMOs control ECTV’s systemic spread, preventing early death, while B cells make antibodies that eliminate ECTV. Our work demonstrates that within an infected animal that survives ECTV infection, intrinsic and bystander infection of iMOs and B cells differentially control the transcription of genes important for immune cell function and, perhaps, cell identity. Bystander cells upregulate metabolism, antigen presentation, and interferon-stimulated genes. Infected cells downregulate many cell-type-specific genes and upregulate transcripts typical of non-immune cells. Bystander (Bys) and infected (Inf) iMOs non-redundantly contribute to the cytokine milieu and the interferon response. Furthermore, we uncover how type I interferon (IFN-I) or IFN-γ signaling differentially regulates immune pathways in Inf and Bys iMOs and that, at steady state, IFN-I primes iMOs for rapid IFN-I production and antigen presentation.

Abstract: Summary
Co-transcriptional R loops arise from stalling of RNA polymerase, leading to the formation of stable DNA:RNA hybrids. Unresolved R loops promote genome instability but are counteracted by helicases and nucleases. Here, we show that branchpoint translocases are a third class of R-loop-displacing enzyme in vitro. In cells, deficiency in the Fanconi-anemia-associated branchpoint translocase FANCM causes R-loop accumulation, particularly after treatment with DNA:RNA-hybrid-stabilizing agents. This correlates with FANCM localization at R-loop-prone regions of the genome. Moreover, other branchpoint translocases associated with human disease, such as SMARCAL1 and ZRANB3, and those from lower organisms can also remove R loops in vitro. Branchpoint translocases are more potent than helicases in resolving R loops, indicating their evolutionary important role in R-loop suppression. In human cells, FANCM, SMARCAL1, and ZRANB3 depletion causes additive effects on R-loop accumulation and DNA damage. Our work reveals a mechanistic basis for R-loop displacement that is linked to genome stability.

Abstract: Summary
In the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (NCT02889978) substudy 1, we evaluate several approaches for a circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test by defining clinical limit of detection (LOD) based on circulating tumor allele fraction (cTAF), enabling performance comparisons. Among 10 machine-learning classifiers trained on the same samples and independently validated, when evaluated at 98% specificity, those using whole-genome (WG) methylation, single nucleotide variants with paired white blood cell background removal, and combined scores from classifiers evaluated in this study show the highest cancer signal detection sensitivities. Compared with clinical stage and tumor type, cTAF is a more significant predictor of classifier performance and may more closely reflect tumor biology. Clinical LODs mirror relative sensitivities for all approaches. The WG methylation feature best predicts cancer signal origin. WG methylation is the most promising technology for MCED and informs development of a targeted methylation MCED test.

Abstract: Summary
Pain chronicity involves unpleasant experience in both somatosensory and affective aspects, accompanied with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) neuroplastic alterations. However, whether specific PFC neuronal ensembles underlie pain chronicity remains elusive. Here we identify a nociceptive neuronal ensemble in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which shows prominent reactivity to nociceptive stimuli. We observed that this ensemble shows distinct molecular characteristics and is densely connected to pain-related regions including basolateral amygdala (BLA) and lateral parabrachial nuclei (LPB). Prolonged chemogenetic activation of this nociceptive neuronal ensemble, but not a randomly transfected subset of dmPFC neurons, induces chronic pain-like behaviors in normal mice. By contrast, silencing the nociceptive dmPFC neurons relieves both pain hypersensitivity and anxiety in mice with chronic inflammatory pain. These results suggest the presence of specific dmPFC neuronal ensembles in processing nociceptive information and regulating pain chronicity.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) are the specific devices that mediate the dissemination of antibiotic resistant genes via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Multi-drug-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) represents a clinical public health threat because of its transferable plasmid with a functional plasmid-encoded (PE)-T4SS. Here, we report a chromosome-encoded (CE)-T4SS that exists in 40% of E. faecalis isolates. Compared with the PE-T4SS, CE-T4SS displays distinct characteristics in protein architecture and is capable of mediating large and genome-wide gene transfer in an imprecise manner. Reciprocal exchange of CE-T4SS- or PE-T4SS-associated origin of transfer (oriT) could disrupt HGT function, indicating that CE-T4SS is an independent system compared with PE-T4SS. Taken together, the CE-T4SS sheds light on the knowledge of HGT in gram-positive bacteria and triggers us to explore more evolutionary mechanisms in E. faecalis.

Abstract: Summary
Recurrent deletion of 16q12.2 is observed in luminal breast cancer, yet the causal genomic alterations in this region are largely unknown. In this study, we identify that loss of AKTIP, which is located on 16q12.2, drives tumorigenesis of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive, but not ERα-negative, breast cancer cells and is associated with poor prognosis of patients with ERα-positive breast cancer. Intriguingly, AKTIP-depleted tumors have increased ERα protein level and activity. Cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated protein 1 (CAND1), which regulates the cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases, protects ERα from cullin 2-dependent proteasomal degradation. Apart from ERα signaling, AKTIP loss triggers JAK2-STAT3 activation, which provides an alternative survival signal when ERα is inhibited. AKTIP-depleted MCF7 cells and ERα-positive patient-derived organoids are more resistant to ERα antagonists. Importantly, the resistance can be overcome by co-inhibition of JAK2/STAT3. Together, our results highlight the subtype-specific functional consequences of AKTIP loss and provide a mechanistic explanation for the enriched AKTIP copy-number loss in ERα-positive breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron sublineages have escaped most receptor-binding domain (RBD)-targeting therapeutic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which proves that previous NAb drug screening strategies are deficient against the fast-evolving SARS-CoV-2. Better broad NAb drug candidate selection methods are needed. Here, we describe a rational approach for identifying RBD-targeting broad SARS-CoV-2 NAb cocktails. Based on high-throughput epitope determination, we propose that broad NAb drugs should target non-immunodominant RBD epitopes to avoid herd-immunity-directed escape mutations. Also, their interacting antigen residues should focus on sarbecovirus conserved sites and associate with critical viral functions, making the antibody-escaping mutations less likely to appear. Following these criteria, a featured non-competing antibody cocktail, SA55+SA58, is identified from a large collection of broad sarbecovirus NAbs isolated from SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated SARS convalescents. SA55+SA58 potently neutralizes ACE2-utilizing sarbecoviruses, including circulating Omicron variants, and could serve as broad SARS-CoV-2 prophylactics to offer long-term protection, especially for individuals who are immunocompromised or with high-risk comorbidities.

Abstract: Summary
A long-standing question in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) field has been whether alternative genetic alterations could substitute for oncogenic KRAS mutations in initiating malignancy. Here, we report that Neurofibromin1 (NF1) inactivation can bypass the requirement of mutant KRAS for PDAC pathogenesis. An in-depth analysis of PDAC databases reveals various genetic alterations in the NF1 locus, including nonsense mutations, which occur predominantly in tumors with wild-type KRAS. Genetic experiments demonstrate that NF1 ablation culminates in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, an early step in PDAC. Furthermore, NF1 haploinsufficiency results in a dramatic acceleration of KrasG12D-driven PDAC. Finally, we show an association between NF1 and p53 that is orchestrated by PML, and mosaic analysis with double markers demonstrates that concomitant inactivation of NF1 and Trp53 is sufficient to trigger full-blown PDAC. Together, these findings open up an exploratory framework for apprehending the mechanistic paradigms of PDAC with normal KRAS, for which no effective therapy is available.

Abstract: Summary
In North America, the Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, is commonly transmitted by the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis. Tick saliva facilitates blood feeding and enhances pathogen survival and transmission. Here, we demonstrate that I. scapularis complement C1q-like protein 3 (IsC1ql3), a tick salivary protein, directly interacts with B. burgdorferi and is important during the initial stage of spirochetal infection of mice. Mice fed upon by B. burgdorferi-infected IsC1ql3-silenced ticks, or IsC1ql3-immunized mice fed upon by B. burgdorferi-infected ticks, have a lower spirochete burden during the early phase of infection compared with control animals. Mechanically, IsC1ql3 interacts with the globular C1q receptor present on the surface of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in decreased production of interferon γ. IsC1ql3 is a C1q-domain-containing protein identified in arthropod vectors and has an important role in B. burgdorferi infectivity as the spirochete transitions from the tick to vertebrate host.

Abstract: Summary
Spatially modulated grid cells have been recently found in the rat secondary visual cortex (V2) during active navigation. However, the computational mechanism and functional significance of V2 grid cells remain unknown. To address the knowledge gap, we train a biologically inspired excitatory-inhibitory recurrent neural network to perform a two-dimensional spatial navigation task with multisensory input. We find grid-like responses in both excitatory and inhibitory RNN units, which are robust with respect to spatial cues, dimensionality of visual input, and activation function. Population responses reveal a low-dimensional, torus-like manifold and attractor. We find a link between functional grid clusters with similar receptive fields and structured excitatory-to-excitatory connections. Additionally, multistable torus-like attractors emerged with increasing sparsity in inter- and intra-subnetwork connectivity. Finally, irregular grid patterns are found in recurrent neural network (RNN) units during a visual sequence recognition task. Together, our results suggest common computational mechanisms of V2 grid cells for spatial and non-spatial tasks.

Abstract: Summary
PALI1 is a newly identified accessory protein of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that catalyzes H3K27 methylation. However, the roles of PALI1 in cancer are yet to be defined. Here, we report that PALI1 is upregulated in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) and competes with JARID2 for binding to the PRC2 core subunit SUZ12. PALI1 further interacts with the H3K9 methyltransferase G9A, bridging the formation of a unique G9A-PALI1-PRC2 super-complex that occupies a subset of G9A-target genes to mediate dual H3K9/K27 methylation and gene repression. Many of these genes are developmental regulators required for cell differentiation, and their loss in PCa predicts poor prognosis. Accordingly, PALI1 and G9A drive PCa cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Collectively, our study shows that PALI1 harnesses two central epigenetic mechanisms to suppress cellular differentiation and promote tumorigenesis, which can be targeted by dual EZH2 and G9A inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Placental fetal macrophages (fMacs) are the only immune cells on the fetal side of the placental barrier. Mouse models have not been used to test their function because they have previously been found to have distinct cellular origins and functions in mice and humans. Here, we test the ontogeny of mouse placental fMacs. Using a new Hoxa13Cre allele that labels all placental endothelial cells (ECs), we demonstrate that mouse placenta fMacs do not arise from placental endothelium. Instead, lineage tracing studies using Tie2-Cre and Cx3cr1CreERT2 alleles demonstrate that mouse placental fMacs arise from yolk sac endothelium. Administration of blocking antibodies against CSF1R at E6.5 and E7.5 results in depletion of placental fMacs throughout pregnancy, and this suggests a yolk sac origin, similar to that in human fMacs. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Liang et al., published in Developmental Cell. A response by Liang and Liu is published in this issue.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of cellular hypoxia pathways, orchestrated by HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factors, is a common feature of multiple tumor types, resulting from microenvironment factors and oncogenic mutation. Although they help drive many of the “hallmarks” of cancer and are associated with poor outcome and resistance to therapy, the transcriptional targets of HIF vary considerably depending on the cell type. By integrating 72 genome-wide assays of HIF binding and transcriptional regulation from multiple cancer types, we define a consensus set of 48 HIF target genes that is highly conserved across cancer types and cell lineages. These genes provide an effective marker of HIF activation in bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses across a wide range of cancer types and in malignant and stromal cell types. This allows the tissue-orchestrated responses to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and to oncogenic HIF activation to be deconvoluted at the tumor and single-cell level.

Abstract: Summary
Heat stress (HS) induces a cellular response leading to profound changes in gene expression. Here, we show that human YTHDC1, a reader of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification, mostly associates to the chromatin fraction and that HS induces a redistribution of YTHDC1 across the genome, including to heat-induced heat shock protein (HSP) genes. YTHDC1 binding to m6A-modified HSP transcripts co-transcriptionally promotes expression of HSPs. In parallel, hundreds of the genes enriched in YTHDC1 during HS have their transcripts undergoing YTHDC1- and m6A-dependent intron retention. Later, YTHDC1 concentrates within nuclear stress bodies (nSBs) where it binds to m6A-modified SATIII non-coding RNAs, produced in an HSF1-dependent manner upon HS. These findings reveal that YTHDC1 plays a central role in a chromatin-associated m6A-based reprogramming of gene expression during HS. Furthermore, they support the model where the subsequent and temporary sequestration of YTHDC1 within nSBs calibrates the timing of this YTHDC1-dependent gene expression reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Crosstalk between metabolic and signaling events that induce tumor metastasis remains elusive. Here, we determine how oncogenic sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) metabolism induces intracellular C3 complement activation to enhance migration/metastasis. We demonstrate that increased S1P metabolism activates C3 complement processing through S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1). S1P/S1PR1-activated intracellular C3b-α′2 is associated with PPIL1 through glutamic acid 156 (E156) and aspartic acid 111 (D111) residues, resulting in NLRP3/inflammasome induction. Inactivation mutations of S1PR1 to prevent S1P signaling or mutations of C3b-α′2 to prevent its association with PPIL1 attenuate inflammasome activation and reduce lung colonization/metastasis in mice. Also, activation of the S1PR1/C3/PPIL1/NLRP3 axis is highly associated with human metastatic melanoma tissues and patient-derived xenografts. Moreover, targeting S1PR1/C3/PPIL1/NLRP3 signaling using molecular, genetic, and pharmacologic tools prevents lung colonization/metastasis of various murine cancer cell lines using WT and C3a-receptor1 knockout (C3aR1−/−) mice. These data provide strategies for treating high-grade/metastatic tumors by targeting the S1PR1/C3/inflammasome axis.

Abstract: Summary
PARP13/ZAP (zinc-finger antiviral protein) acts against multiple viruses by promoting degradation of viral mRNA. PARP13 has four N-terminal zinc (Zn) fingers that bind CG-rich nucleotide sequences, a C-terminal ADP ribosyltransferase fold, and a central region with a fifth Zn finger and tandem WWE domains. The central PARP13 region, ZnF5-WWE1-WWE2, is implicated in binding poly(ADP-ribose); however, there are limited insights into its structure and function. We present crystal structures of ZnF5-WWE1-WWE2 from mouse PARP13 in complex with ADP-ribose and in complex with ATP. The crystal structures and binding studies demonstrate that WWE2 interacts with ADP-ribose and ATP, whereas WWE1 does not have a functional binding site. Binding studies with poly(ADP-ribose) ligands indicate that WWE2 serves as an anchor for preferential binding to the terminal end of poly(ADP-ribose) chains. The composite ZnF5-WWE1-WWE2 structure forms an extended surface to engage ADP-ribose chains, representing a distinctive mode of recognition that provides a framework for investigating the impact of poly(ADP-ribose) on PARP13 function.

Abstract: Summary
A hostile microenvironment in tumor tissues disrupts endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and induces the unfolded protein response (UPR). A chronic UPR in both cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes could facilitate the evasion of immune surveillance. However, how the UPR in cancer cells cripples the anti-tumor immune response is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that, in cancer cells, the UPR component X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) favors the synthesis and secretion of cholesterol, which activates myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and causes immunosuppression. Cholesterol is delivered in the form of small extracellular vesicles and internalized by MDSCs through macropinocytosis. Genetic or pharmacological depletion of XBP1 or reducing the tumor cholesterol content remarkably decreases MDSC abundance and triggers robust anti-tumor responses. Thus, our data unravel the cell-non-autonomous role of XBP1/cholesterol signaling in the regulation of tumor growth and suggest its inhibition as a useful strategy for improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) pausing in early elongation is critical for gene regulation. Paused RNAPII can be released into productive elongation by the kinase P-TEFb or targeted for premature termination by the Integrator complex. Integrator comprises endonuclease and phosphatase activities, driving termination by cleavage of nascent RNA and removal of stimulatory phosphorylation. We generated a degron system for rapid Integrator endonuclease (INTS11) depletion to probe the direct consequences of Integrator-mediated RNA cleavage. Degradation of INTS11 elicits nearly universal increases in active early elongation complexes. However, these RNAPII complexes fail to achieve optimal elongation rates and exhibit persistent Integrator phosphatase activity. Thus, only short transcripts are significantly upregulated following INTS11 loss, including transcription factors, signaling regulators, and non-coding RNAs. We propose a uniform molecular function for INTS11 across all RNAPII-transcribed loci, with differential effects on particular genes, pathways, or RNA biotypes reflective of transcript lengths rather than specificity of Integrator activity.

Abstract: Summary
The two doublet histones of Marseillevirus are distantly related to the four eukaryotic core histones and wrap 121 base pairs of DNA to form remarkably similar nucleosomes. By permeabilizing Marseillevirus virions and performing genome-wide nuclease digestion, chemical cleavage, and mass spectrometry assays, we find that the higher-order organization of Marseillevirus chromatin fundamentally differs from that of eukaryotes. Marseillevirus nucleosomes fully protect DNA within virions as closely abutted 121-bp DNA-wrapped cores without linker DNA or phasing along genes. Likewise, we observed that nucleosomes reconstituted onto multi-copy tandem repeats of a nucleosome-positioning sequence are tightly packed. Dense promiscuous packing of fully wrapped nucleosomes rather than “beads on a string” with genic punctuation represents a distinct mode of DNA packaging by histones. We suggest that doublet histones have evolved for viral genome protection and may resemble an early stage of histone differentiation leading to the eukaryotic octameric nucleosome.

Abstract: Membrane depolarization triggers gene expression through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) in a process called Excitation-transcription (ET) coupling. Mutations in the channel subunits α11.2, or β2d, are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD. Here, we found that two mutations S143F and G113S within the rat Cavβ2a corresponding to autistic related mutations Cavβ2dS197F and Cavβ2dG167S in the human Cavβ2d, activate ET-coupling via the RAS/ERK/CREB pathway. Membrane depolarization of HEK293 cells co-expressing α11.2 and α2δ with Cavβ2aS143F or Cavβ2aG113S triggers constitutive transcriptional activation, which is correlated with facilitated channel activity. Similar to the Timothy-associated autistic mutation α11.2G406R, constitutive gene activation is attributed to a hyperpolarizing shift in the activation kinetics of Cav1.2. Pulldown of RasGRF2 and RhoGEF by wt and the Cavβ2a autistic mutants is consistent with Cavβ2/Ras activation in ET coupling and implicates Rho signaling as yet another molecular pathway activated by Cavα11.2/Cavβ2 . Facilitated spontaneous channel activity preceding enhanced gene activation via the Ras/ERK/CREB pathway, appears a general molecular mechanism for Ca2+ channel mediated ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) comprises more than 30 nucleoporins (NUPs) and is a hallmark of eukaryotes. NUPs have been suggested to be important in regulating gene transcription and 3D genome organization. However, evidence in support of their direct roles remains limited. Here, by Cut&Run, we find that core NUPs display broad but also cell-type-specific association with active promoters and enhancers in human cells. Auxin-mediated rapid depletion of two NUPs demonstrates that NUP93, but not NUP35, directly and specifically controls gene transcription. NUP93 directly activates genes with high levels of RNA polymerase II loading and transcriptional elongation by facilitating full BRD4 recruitment to their active enhancers. dCas9-based tethering confirms a direct and causal role of NUP93 in gene transcriptional activation. Unexpectedly, in situ Hi-C and H3K27ac or H3K4me1 HiChIP results upon acute NUP93 depletion show negligible changesS2211-1247(22)01437-1 of 3D genome organization ranging from A/B compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) to enhancer-promoter contacts.

Abstract: Summary
The immune system and placenta have a dynamic relationship across gestation to accommodate fetal growth and development. High-resolution characterization of this maternal-fetal interface is necessary to better understand the immunology of pregnancy and its complications. We developed a single-cell framework to simultaneously immuno-phenotype circulating, endovascular, and tissue-resident cells at the maternal-fetal interface throughout gestation, discriminating maternal and fetal contributions. Our data reveal distinct immune profiles across the endovascular and tissue compartments with tractable dynamics throughout gestation that respond to a systemic immune challenge in a gestationally dependent manner. We uncover a significant role for the innate immune system where phagocytes and neutrophils drive temporal organization of the placenta through remarkably diverse populations, including PD-L1+ subsets having compartmental and early gestational bias. Our approach and accompanying datasets provide a resource for additional investigations into gestational immunology and evoke a more significant role for the innate immune system in establishing the microenvironment of early pregnancy.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria have diverse defenses against phages. In response, jumbo phages evade multiple DNA-targeting defenses by protecting their DNA inside a nucleus-like structure. We previously demonstrated that RNA-targeting type III CRISPR-Cas systems provide jumbo phage immunity by recognizing viral mRNA exported from the nucleus for translation. Here, we demonstrate that recognition of phage mRNA by the type III system activates a cyclic triadenylate-dependent accessory nuclease, NucC. Although unable to access phage DNA in the nucleus, NucC degrades the bacterial chromosome, triggers cell death, and disrupts phage replication and maturation. Hence, type-III-mediated jumbo phage immunity occurs via abortive infection, with suppression of the viral epidemic protecting the population. We further show that type III systems targeting jumbo phages have diverse accessory nucleases, including RNases that provide immunity. Our study demonstrates how type III CRISPR-Cas systems overcome the inaccessibility of jumbo phage DNA to provide robust immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular signaling by fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) is a highly regulated process mediated by specific interactions between distinct subsets of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands and two FGFR isoforms generated by alternative splicing: an epithelial b- and mesenchymal c-isoforms. Here, we investigate the properties of a mini-protein, mb7, developed by an in silico design strategy to bind to the ligand-binding region of FGFR2. We describe structural, biophysical, and cellular analyses demonstrating that mb7 binds with high affinity to the c-isoforms of FGFR, resulting in inhibition of cellular signaling induced by a subset of FGFs that preferentially activate c-isoforms of FGFR. Notably, as mb7 blocks interaction between FGFR with Klotho proteins, it functions as an antagonist of the metabolic hormones FGF19 and FGF21, providing mechanistic insights and strategies for the development of therapeutics for diseases driven by aberrantly activated FGFRs.

Abstract: Summary
The classic network of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) is highly interconnected and controls a diverse array of biological processes. In multicellular eukaryotes, the MAPKs ERK, JNK, and p38 control opposing cell behaviors but are often activated simultaneously, raising questions about how input-output specificity is achieved. Here, we use multiplexed MAPK activity biosensors to investigate how cell fate control emerges from the connectivity and dynamics of the MAPK network. Through chemical and genetic perturbation, we systematically explore the outputs and functions of all the MAP3 kinases encoded in the human genome and show that MAP3Ks control cell fate by triggering unique combinations of MAPK activity. We show that these MAPK activity combinations explain the paradoxical dual role of JNK signaling as pro-apoptotic or pro-proliferative kinase. Overall, our integrative analysis indicates that the MAPK network operates as a unit to control cell fate and shifts the focus from MAPKs to MAP3Ks to better understand signaling-mediated control of cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Alterations in the intestinal physiology caused by pathogen colonization result in immune activation. To provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the control of immune activation by changes in intestinal homeostasis, we conducted a forward genetic screen for suppressors of immune activation by intestinal distension in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results indicate that C. elegans ACC-4, a member of a family of acetylcholine receptors, is required in immune activation by defects in the defecation motor program or by pathogen infection. ACC-4 acts postsynaptically in non-cholinergic RIM neurons to regulate several immune genes and a Wnt-mediated host immune response. These findings uncover a gut-brain-microbial axis that uses neural cholinergic signaling and the Wnt pathway to control immune activation in response to alterations in intestinal homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
T cells dynamically rewire their metabolism during an immune response. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to CD8+ T cells activated and differentiated in vitro in physiological medium to resolve these metabolic dynamics. We identify a differential time-dependent reliance of activating T cells on the synthesis versus uptake of various non-essential amino acids, which we corroborate with functional assays. We also identify metabolic genes that potentially dictate the outcome of T cell differentiation, by ranking them based on their expression dynamics. Among them, we find asparagine synthetase (Asns), whose expression peaks for effector T cells and decays toward memory formation. Disrupting these expression dynamics by ASNS overexpression promotes an effector phenotype, enhancing the anti-tumor response of adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells in a mouse melanoma model. We thus provide a resource of dynamic expression changes during CD8+ T cell activation and differentiation, and identify ASNS expression dynamics as a modulator of CD8+ T cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian genome encodes thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), many of which are developmentally regulated and differentially expressed across tissues, suggesting their potential roles in cellular differentiation. Despite this expression pattern, little is known about how lncRNAs influence lineage commitment at the molecular level. Here, we demonstrate that perturbation of an embryonic stem cell/early embryonic lncRNA, pluripotency-associated transcript 4 (Platr4), directly influences the specification of cardiac-mesoderm-lineage differentiation. We show that Platr4 acts as a molecular scaffold or chaperone interacting with the Hippo-signaling pathway molecules Yap and Tead4 to regulate the expression of a downstream target gene, Ctgf, which is crucial to the cardiac-lineage program. Importantly, Platr4 knockout mice exhibit myocardial atrophy and valve mucinous degeneration, which are both associated with reduced cardiac output and sudden heart failure. Together, our findings provide evidence that Platr4 is required in cardiac-lineage specification and adult heart function in mice.

Abstract: Summary
The ubiquitination/proteasome system is important for the spatiotemporal control of protein synthesis and degradation at synapses, while dysregulation may underlie autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, methods allowing direct visualization of the subcellular localization and temporal dynamics of protein ubiquitination are lacking. Here we report the development of Single-Molecule Ubiquitin Mediated Fluorescence Complementation (SM-UbFC) as a method to visualize and quantify the dynamics of protein ubiquitination in dendrites of live neurons in culture. Using SM-UbFC, we demonstrate that the rate of PSD-95 ubiquitination is elevated in dendrites of FMR1 KO neurons compared with wild-type controls. We further demonstrate the rapid ubiquitination of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein, FMRP, and the AMPA receptor subunit, GluA1, which are known to be key events in the regulation of synaptic protein synthesis and plasticity. SM-UbFC will be useful for future studies on the regulation of synaptic protein homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the most common precursor of invasive breast cancer (IBC), with variable propensity for progression. We perform multiscale, integrated molecular profiling of DCIS with clinical outcomes by analyzing 774 DCIS samples from 542 patients with 7.3 years median follow-up from the Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium 038 study and the Resource of Archival Breast Tissue cohorts. We identify 812 genes associated with ipsilateral recurrence within 5 years from treatment and develop a classifier that predicts DCIS or IBC recurrence in both cohorts. Pathways associated with recurrence include proliferation, immune response, and metabolism. Distinct stromal expression patterns and immune cell compositions are identified. Our multiscale approach employed in situ methods to generate a spatially resolved atlas of breast precancers, where complementary modalities can be directly compared and correlated with conventional pathology findings, disease states, and clinical outcome.

Abstract: Mediator complex (MED) contains 28 subunits, functions as a transcription machinery through interaction with RNA polymerase II and modulates gene expression involved in cell survival and growth. MED27, as an oncogene, stimulates malignant behavior of various tumors. Role of MED27 in gastric cancer was assessed in this study. Firstly, bioinformatics analysis predicted that MED27 was elevated in gastric cancer. Gastric cancer cells also showed higher expression of MED27 than normal gastric epithelial cells. Secondly, functional assays revealed that silencing of MED27 decreased cell viability, and reduced proliferation of gastric cancer. Cell invasion and migration of gastric cancer were also inhibited by loss of MED27. Moreover, knockdown of MED27 inhibited angiogenesis of gastric cancer. Thirdly, nuclear protein of β-catenin in gastric cancer was reduced by silencing of MED27. Lastly, in vivo tumor growth of gastric cancer was suppressed by interference of MED27. In conclusion, MED27 functioned as an oncogene in gastric cancer through promoting cell metastasis and angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial malfunction and autophagy defects are often concurrent phenomena associated with neurodegeneration. We show that Miga, a mitochondrial outer-membrane protein that regulates endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial contact sites (ERMCSs), is required for autophagy. Loss of Miga results in an accumulation of autophagy markers and substrates, whereas PI3P and Syx17 levels are reduced. Further experiments indicated that the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes is defective in Miga mutants. Miga binds to Atg14 and Uvrag; concordantly, Miga overexpression results in Atg14 and Uvrag recruitment to mitochondria. The heightened PI3K activity induced by Miga requires Uvrag, whereas Miga-mediated stabilization of Syx17 is dependent on Atg14. Miga-regulated ERMCSs are critical for PI3P formation but are not essential for the stabilization of Syx17. In summary, we identify a mitochondrial protein that regulates autophagy by recruiting two alternative components of the PI3K complex present at the ERMCSs.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of the electron transport chain (ETC) prevents the regeneration of mitochondrial NAD+, resulting in cessation of the oxidative tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and a consequent dependence upon reductive carboxylation for aspartate synthesis. NAD+ regeneration alone in the cytosol can rescue the viability of ETC-deficient cells. Yet, how this occurs and whether transfer of oxidative equivalents to the mitochondrion is required remain unknown. Here, we show that inhibition of the ETC drives reversal of the mitochondrial aspartate transaminase (GOT2) as well as malate and succinate dehydrogenases (MDH2 and SDH) to transfer oxidative NAD+ equivalents into the mitochondrion. This supports the NAD+-dependent activity of the mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and thereby enables anaplerosis—the entry of glutamine-derived carbon into the TCA cycle and connected biosynthetic pathways. Thus, under impaired ETC function, the cytosolic redox state is communicated into the mitochondrion and acts as a rheostat to support GDH activity and cell viability.

Abstract: Summary
MYC-driven medulloblastoma (MB) is an aggressive pediatric brain tumor characterized by therapy resistance and disease recurrence. Here, we integrated data from unbiased genetic screening and metabolomic profiling to identify multiple cancer-selective metabolic vulnerabilities in MYC-driven MB tumor cells, which are amenable to therapeutic targeting. Among these targets, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme that catalyzes de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, emerged as a favorable candidate for therapeutic targeting. Mechanistically, DHODH inhibition acts on target, leading to uridine metabolite scarcity and hyperlipidemia, accompanied by reduced protein O-GlcNAcylation and c-Myc degradation. Pyrimidine starvation evokes a metabolic stress response that leads to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. We further show that an orally available small-molecule DHODH inhibitor demonstrates potent mono-therapeutic efficacy against patient-derived MB xenografts in vivo. The reprogramming of pyrimidine metabolism in MYC-driven medulloblastoma represents an unappreciated therapeutic strategy and a potential new class of treatments with stronger cancer selectivity and fewer neurotoxic sequelae.

Abstract: Summary
ATG9A and ATG2A are essential core members of the autophagy machinery. ATG9A is a lipid scramblase that allows equilibration of lipids across a membrane bilayer, whereas ATG2A facilitates lipid flow between tethered membranes. Although both have been functionally linked during the formation of autophagosomes, the molecular details and consequences of their interaction remain unclear. By combining data from peptide arrays, crosslinking, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry together with cryoelectron microscopy, we propose a molecular model of the ATG9A-2A complex. Using this integrative structure modeling approach, we identify several interfaces mediating ATG9A-2A interaction that would allow a direct transfer of lipids from ATG2A into the lipid-binding perpendicular branch of ATG9A. Mutational analyses combined with functional activity assays demonstrate their importance for autophagy, thereby shedding light on this protein complex at the heart of autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro studies suggest that mapping the spatiotemporal complexity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling is essential to understanding its function. The lack of tools to directly monitor NF-κB proteins in vivo has hindered such efforts. Here, we introduce reporter mice with the endogenous RelA (p65) or c-Rel labeled with distinct fluorescent proteins and a double knockin with both subunits labeled. Overcoming hurdles in simultaneous live-cell imaging of RelA and c-Rel, we show that quantitative features of signaling reflect the identity of activating ligands, differ between primary and immortalized cells, and shift toward c-Rel in microglia from aged brains. RelA:c-Rel heterodimer is unexpectedly depleted in the nuclei of stimulated cells. Trajectories of subunit co-expression in immune lineages reveal a reduction at key cell maturation stages. These results demonstrate the power of these reporters in gaining deeper insights into NF-κB biology, with the spectral complementarity of the labeled NF-κB proteins enabling diverse applications.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) are observed until progression, but early treatment may improve outcomes. We conducted a phase II trial of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (EloLenDex) in patients with high-risk SMM and performed single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing on 149 bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from patients and healthy donors (HDs). We find that early treatment with EloLenDex is safe and effective and provide a comprehensive characterization of alterations in immune cell composition and TCR repertoire diversity in patients. We show that the similarity of a patient’s immune cell composition to that of HDs may have prognostic relevance at diagnosis and after treatment and that the abundance of granzyme K (GZMK)+ CD8+ effector memory T (TEM) cells may be associated with treatment response. Last, we uncover similarities between immune alterations observed in the BM and PB, suggesting that PB-based immune profiling may have diagnostic and prognostic utility.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is an essential catabolic process that promotes the clearance of surplus or damaged intracellular components. Loss of autophagy in age-related human pathologies contributes to tissue degeneration through a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved role of autophagy from yeast to humans in the preservation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels, which are critical for cell survival. In respiring mouse fibroblasts with autophagy deficiency, loss of mitochondrial quality control was found to trigger hyperactivation of stress responses mediated by NADases of PARP and Sirtuin families. Uncontrolled depletion of the NAD(H) pool by these enzymes ultimately contributed to mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cell death. Pharmacological and genetic interventions targeting several key elements of this cascade improved the survival of autophagy-deficient yeast, mouse fibroblasts, and human neurons. Our study provides a mechanistic link between autophagy and NAD metabolism and identifies targets for interventions in human diseases associated with autophagic, lysosomal, and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are an effective therapy for various cancers; however, they can induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs) as a side effect. Myocarditis is an uncommon, but fatal, irAE caused after ICI treatments. Currently, the mechanism of ICI-associated myocarditis is unclear. Here, we show the development of myocarditis in A/J mice induced by anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) administration alone without tumor cell inoculation, immunization, or viral infection. Mice with myocarditis have increased cardiac infiltration, elevated cardiac troponin levels, and arrhythmia. Anti-PD-1 mAb treatment also causes irAEs in other organs. Autoimmune T cells recognizing cardiac myosin are activated and increased in mice with myocarditis. Notably, cardiac myosin-specific T cells are present in naive mice, showing a phenotype of antigen-experienced T cells. Collectively, we establish a clinically relevant mouse model for ICI-associated myocarditis and find a contribution of cardiac myosin-specific T cells to ICI-associated myocarditis development and pathogenesis.

Abstract: A structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), nucleocapsid (N) protein is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 on the serine/arginine (SR) rich motif located in disordered regions. Although phosphorylation by GSK-3β constitutes a critical event for viral replication, the molecular mechanism underlying N phosphorylation is not well understood. In this study, we found the putative alpha-helix L/FxxxL/AxxRL motif known as the GSK-3 interacting domain (GID), found in many endogenous GSK-3β binding proteins, such as Axins, FRATs, WWOX, and GSKIP. Indeed, N interacts with GSK-3β similarly to Axin, and Leu to Glu substitution of the GID abolished the interaction, with loss of N phosphorylation. The N phosphorylation is also required for its structural loading in a virus-like particle (VLP). Compared to other coronaviruses, N of Sarbecovirus lineage including bat RaTG13 harbors a CDK1-primed phosphorylation site and Gly-rich linker for enhanced phosphorylation by GSK-3β. Furthermore, we found that the S202R mutant found in Delta and R203K/G204R mutant found in the Omicron variant allow increased abundance and hyper-phosphorylation of N. Our observations suggest that GID and mutations for increased phosphorylation in N may have contributed to the evolution of variants.

Abstract: Cellulose microfibril patterning influences many of the mechanical attributes of plant cell walls. We developed a simple, fluorescence microscopy-based method to detect the orientation of newly-synthesized cellulose microfibrils in epidermal peels of onion and Arabidopsis. It is based on Alexa Fluor 488-tagged carbohydrate binding module 3a (CBM3a) from Clostridium thermocellum which displayed a nearly 4-fold greater binding to cell walls at pH 5.5 compared with pH 8. Binding to isolated cellulose did not display this pH dependence. At pH 7.5 fibrillar patterns at the surface of the epidermal peels were visible, corresponding to the directionality of surface cellulose microfibrils, as verified by atomic force microscopy. The fibrillar pattern was not visible as the labeling intensity increased at lower pH. The pH of greatest cell wall labeling corresponds to the isoelectric point of CBM3a, suggesting that electrostatic forces limit CBM3a penetration into the wall. Consistent with this, digestion of the wall with pectate lyase to remove homogalacturonan increased labeling intensity. We conclude that electrostatic interactions strongly influence labeling of cell walls with CBM3 and potentially other proteins, holding implications for any work that relies on penetration of protein probes such as CBMs, antibodies, or enzymes into charged polymeric substrates.

Abstract: Summary
In healthy vessels, endothelial cells maintain a stable, differentiated, and growth-arrested phenotype for years. Upon injury, a rapid phenotypic switch facilitates proliferation to restore tissue perfusion. Here we report the identification of the endothelial cell-enriched long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PCAT19, which contributes to the proliferative switch and acts as a safeguard for the endothelial genome. PCAT19 is enriched in confluent, quiescent endothelial cells and binds to the full replication protein A (RPA) complex in a DNA damage- and cell-cycle-related manner. Our results suggest that PCAT19 limits the phosphorylation of RPA2, primarily on the serine 33 (S33) residue, and thereby facilitates an appropriate DNA damage response while slowing cell cycle progression. Reduction in PCAT19 levels in response to either loss of cell contacts or knockdown promotes endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. Collectively, PCAT19 acts as a dynamic guardian of the endothelial genome and facilitates rapid switching from quiescence to proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a negative regulator of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Mutations in PTEN are found in patients with autism, epilepsy, or macrocephaly. In mouse models, Pten loss results in neuronal hypertrophy, hyperexcitability, seizures, and ASD-like behaviors. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these phenotypes are not well delineated. We determined which of the Pten loss-driven aberrations in neuronal form and function are orchestrated by downstream mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Rapamycin-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 prevented increase in soma size, migration, spine density, and dendritic overgrowth in Pten knockout dentate gyrus granule neurons. Genetic knockout of Raptor to disrupt mTORC1 complex formation blocked Pten loss-mediated neuronal hypertrophy. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that genetic disruption of mTORC1 rescued Pten loss-mediated increase in excitatory synaptic transmission. We have identified an essential role for mTORC1 in orchestrating Pten loss-driven neuronal hypertrophy and synapse formation.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely present in the interstitial tissue of embryos. Although the existence of the metanephros stromal stem cell population has been demonstrated, the focus has been on understanding the process of nephrogenesis, but the biological characterization of stromal stem cell population is less precise. Metanephric mesenchymal stem cells (MMSCs) have a vast potential in kidney tissue engineering and represent excellent candidates in cellular replacement therapy for human disease and veterinary research. Here, we aimed to isolate, culture, and characterize bovine MMSCs. We have successfully obtained a new population of stem cells using renal tissue isolated from three-month-old bovine embryo. MMSCs were isolated by collagenase digestion. The spindle-shaped cells adhered to plastic and exhibited extensive proliferation for more than 26 passages and good clonogenic ability in vitro. Moreover, the metanephric mesenchymal stem cells could be induced to differentiate into mesoderm-derived cells (such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes) and endoderm-derived hepatocyte-like cells in vitro. These results indicated the multiple differentiations potential of MMSCs. Aside from colony-forming, self-renewal, and multilineage differentiation capabilities, the experiments of immunofluorescence and RT-PCR showed that spindle-shaped cells were positive for MSCs-related markers (CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD106), nestin and vimentin, while the hematopoietic cell surface markers CD34 and pan-leukocyte marker CD45 were undetectable. This study provides a technical platform for the preservation of valuable bovine genetic resources and offers a new source for tissue engineering and cell transplantation therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Classically activated pro-inflammatory macrophages are generated from naive macrophages by pro-inflammatory cues that dynamically reprogram their fuel metabolism toward glycolysis. This increases their intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which then activate the transcription and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Our study on mice that lack methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr)-B1 shows that the resulting partial loss of protein methionine reduction in pro-inflammatory macrophages creates a unique metabolic signature characterized by altered fuel utilization, including glucose and pyruvate. This change also associates with hyper-inflammation that is at least partly due to sustained oxidation of an exposed methionine residue (M44) on glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), thereby inducing GAPDH aggregation, inflammasome activation, and subsequent increased interleukin (IL)-1β secretion. Since MsrB1-knockout mice exhibit increased susceptibility to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis, the MsrB1-GAPDH axis may be a key molecular mechanism by which protein redox homeostasis controls the metabolic profile of macrophages and thereby regulates their functions.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer T (NKT) cells operate distinctly different metabolic programming from CD4 T cells, including a strict requirement for glutamine to regulate cell homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that at a steady state, NKT cells have higher glutamine levels than CD4 T cells and that NKT cells increase glutaminolysis on activation. Activated NKT cells use glutamine to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glutathione synthesis. In addition, glutamine-derived nitrogen enables protein glycosylation via the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). Each of these branches of glutamine metabolism seems to be critical for NKT cell homeostasis and mitochondrial functions. Glutaminolysis and HBP differentially regulate interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon γ (IFNγ) production. Glutamine metabolism appears to be controlled by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. These findings highlight a distinct metabolic requirement of NKT cells compared with CD4 T cells, which may have therapeutic implications in the treatment of certain nutrient-restricted diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Heart development is controlled by a complex transcriptional network composed of transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. Mutations in key developmental transcription factor MESP1 and chromatin factors, such as PRC1 and cohesin components, have been found in human congenital heart diseases (CHDs), although their functional mechanism during heart development remains elusive. Here, we find that MESP1 interacts with RING1A/RING1, the core component of PRC1. RING1A depletion impairs human cardiomyocyte differentiation, and cardiac abnormalities similar to those in patients with MESP1 mutations were observed in Ring1A knockout mice. Mechanistically, MESP1 associates with RING1A to activate cardiogenic genes through promoter-enhancer interactions regulated by cohesin and CTCF and histone acetylation mediated by p300. Importantly, CHD mutations of MESP1 significantly affect such mechanisms and impair target gene activation. Together, our results demonstrate the importance of MESP1-RING1A complex in heart development and provide insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of CHDs caused by mutations in MESP1, PRC1, and cohesin components.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic KRas activates mitochondrial fission through Erk-mediated phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1. Drp1 deletion inhibits tumorigenesis of KRas-driven pancreatic cancer, but the role of mitochondrial dynamics in other Ras-driven malignancies is poorly defined. Here we show that in vitro and in vivo growth of KRas-driven lung adenocarcinoma is unaffected by deletion of Drp1 but is inhibited by deletion of Opa1, the GTPase that regulates inner membrane fusion and proper cristae morphology. Mechanistically, Opa1 knockout disrupts cristae morphology and inhibits electron transport chain (ETC) assembly and activity, which inhibits tumor cell proliferation through loss of NAD+ regeneration. Simultaneous inactivation of Drp1 and Opa1 restores cristae morphology, ETC activity, and cell proliferation indicating that mitochondrial fission activity drives ETC dysfunction induced by Opa1 knockout. Our results support a model in which mitochondrial fission events disrupt cristae structure, and tumor cells with hyperactive fission activity require Opa1 activity to maintain ETC function.

Abstract: Summary
Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR) is an RNA-binding protein and a negative regulator of the DNA-repair factor p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1). In non-damage conditions, TIRR is bound to 53BP1. After DNA damage, TIRR and 53BP1 dissociate, and 53BP1 binds the chromatin at the double-strand break (DSB) to promote non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair. However, the exact mechanistic details of this dissociation after damage are unknown. Increasing evidence has implicated RNA as a crucial factor in the DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that RNA can separate TIRR/53BP1. Specifically, RNA with a hairpin secondary structure, transcribed at the DSB by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), promotes TIRR/53BP1 complex separation. This hairpin RNA binds to the same residues on TIRR as 53BP1. Our results uncover a role of DNA-damage-derived RNA in modulating a protein-protein interaction and contribute to our understanding of DSB repair.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian genomes are organized into three-dimensional DNA structures called A/B compartments that are associated with transcriptional activity/inactivity. However, whether these structures are simply correlated with gene expression or are permissive/impermissible to transcription has remained largely unknown because we lack methods to measure DNA organization and transcription simultaneously. Recently, we developed RNA & DNA (RD)-SPRITE, which enables genome-wide measurements of the spatial organization of RNA and DNA. Here we show that RD-SPRITE measures genomic structure surrounding nascent pre-mRNAs and maps their spatial contacts. We find that transcription occurs within B compartments—with multiple active genes simultaneously colocalizing within the same B compartment—and at genes proximal to nucleoli. These results suggest that localization near or within nuclear structures thought to be inactive does not preclude transcription and that active transcription can occur throughout the nucleus. In general, we anticipate RD-SPRITE will be a powerful tool for exploring relationships between genome structure and transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Asymmetric inheritance of cellular content through cell division plays an important role in cell viability and fitness. The dynamics of RNA segregation are so far largely unaddressed. This is partly due to a lack of approaches to follow RNAs over multiple cellular divisions. Here, we establish an approach to quantify RNA dynamics in single cells across several generations in a microfluidics device by tagging RNAs with the diSpinach aptamer. Using S. cerevisiae as a model, we quantitatively characterize intracellular RNA transport from mothers into their buds. Our results suggest that, at cytokinesis, ENO2 diSpinach RNA is preferentially distributed to daughters. This asymmetric RNA segregation depends on the lifespan regulator Sir2 and decreases with increasing replicative age of mothers but does not result from increasing cell size during aging. Overall, our approach opens more opportunities to study RNA dynamics and inheritance in live budding yeast at the single-cell level.

Abstract: Summary
Intrinsic and extrinsic inhibition of neuronal regeneration obstruct spinal cord (SC) repair in mammals. In contrast, adult zebrafish achieve functional recovery after complete SC transection. While studies of innate SC regeneration have focused on axon regrowth as a primary repair mechanism, how local adult neurogenesis affects functional recovery is unknown. Here, we uncover dynamic expression of zebrafish myostatin b (mstnb) in a niche of dorsal SC progenitors after injury. mstnb mutants show impaired functional recovery, normal glial and axonal bridging across the lesion, and an increase in the profiles of newborn neurons. Molecularly, neuron differentiation genes are upregulated, while the neural stem cell maintenance gene fgf1b is downregulated in mstnb mutants. Finally, we show that human fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) treatment rescues the molecular and cellular phenotypes of mstnb mutants. These studies uncover unanticipated neurogenic functions for mstnb and establish the importance of local adult neurogenesis for innate SC repair.

Abstract: Summary
Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are crucial regulators in numerous biological processes. However, the functions and mechanisms of m6A-modified lincRNAs in neuronal development remain unclear. Here, we report an m6A-modified lincRNA, Dppa2 upstream binding RNA (Dubr), abundantly expressed at the early developmental stage of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and cerebral cortex. Silencing Dubr impairs axon elongation of DRG neurons and axon projection and migration of cortical neurons, whereas lacking m6A modification of Dubr fully loses its functions. Mechanically, Dubr interacts with m6A-binding proteins, the YTHDF1/3 complex, through its m6A motifs to protect YTHDF1/3 from degradation via the proteasome pathway. Furthermore, Tau and Calmodulin are regulated by YTHDF1/3 and m6A-modified Dubr. Overexpression of YTHDF1/3 not only rescues the reduced Tau and Calmodulin but also restores axon elongation of DRG neurons by Dubr knockdown. This study uncovers a critical role of m6A-modified lincRNA in neuronal development by regulating the degradation of RNA-binding protein.

Abstract: Summary
Oct4 is exclusively expressed in rodent inner cell mass (ICM) but silenced in its trophectoderm (TE). However, for many non-rodent animals, including pig, cattle, rabbit, goat, and human, OCT4 has a remarkable expression in early TE. This study, applying pig as the main research model, proves that OCT4 expression in TE is supported by a unique GATA motif in the OCT4 upstream conserved regulatory region, and GATA4 is responsible for its activation. Moreover, OCT4 acts as a specific regulator of a narrow range of genes (including BCL2A1 and HNRNP2AB1) that are essential for the first wave of rapid proliferation in early TE. This study describes the regulatory mechanism to direct the OCT4 expression and its significance in TE of porcine preimplantation embryo.

Abstract: Summary
The dynamic regulation of β-cell abundance is poorly understood. Since chromatin remodeling plays critical roles in liver regeneration, these mechanisms could be generally important for regeneration in other tissues. Here, we show that the ARID1A mammalian SWI/SNF complex subunit is a critical regulator of β-cell regeneration. Arid1a is highly expressed in quiescent β-cells but is physiologically suppressed when β-cells proliferate during pregnancy or after pancreas resection. Whole-body Arid1a knockout mice are protected against streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Cell-type and temporally specific genetic dissection show that β-cell-specific Arid1a deletion can potentiate β-cell regeneration in multiple contexts. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of mutant islets reveal increased neuregulin-ERBB-NR4A signaling. Chemical inhibition of ERBB or NR4A1 blocks increased regeneration associated with Arid1a loss. Mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) complex activity is a barrier to β-cell regeneration in physiologic and disease states.

Abstract: Summary
The function of fibroblasts in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains elusive. By targeting Col1α1, a fibroblast-specific marker, we generate mice with ablated Col1α1+ fibroblasts. These mutants show exacerbated blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, enlarged injury volume, and worse neurological function, highlighting a beneficial role of Col1α1+ fibroblasts in ICH. Echoing these findings, fibroblasts significantly decrease endothelial permeability in an in vitro ICH model. Next, we demonstrate that fibroblasts promote BBB integrity in ICH mainly via up-regulating tight junction proteins without affecting transcytosis-associated proteins, indicating a paracellular rather than transcellular mechanism. A subsequent mechanistic study reveals that the BBB-protective effect of fibroblasts is partially mediated by TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2 (TIMP2). Furthermore, we find that exogenous TIMP2 attenuates BBB disruption in these mutants after ICH. These results suggest that Col1α1+ fibroblasts repair BBB damage in ICH via the paracellular pathway in a TIMP2-dependent manner, and that Col1α1+ fibroblasts and TIMP2 may be targeted in ICH treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Pathway analysis is a key analytical stage in the interpretation of omics data, providing a powerful method for detecting alterations in cellular processes. We recently developed a sensitive and distribution-free statistical framework for multisample distribution testing, which we implement here in the open-source R package single-cell pathway analysis (SCPA). We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCPA over commonly used methods, generate a scRNA-seq T cell dataset, and characterize pathway activity over early cellular activation. This reveals regulatory pathways in T cells, including an intrinsic type I interferon system regulating T cell survival and a reliance on arachidonic acid metabolism throughout T cell activation. A systems-level characterization of pathway activity in T cells across multiple tissues also identifies alpha-defensin expression as a hallmark of bone-marrow-derived T cells. Overall, this work provides a widely applicable tool for single-cell pathway analysis and highlights regulatory mechanisms of T cells.

Abstract: Summary
The leukocyte Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-mediated response is important for the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies; however, little is known about the role of FcγRs in other cell types. Here we identify a subset of fibroblasts in human breast cancer that express CD16 (FcγRIII). An abundance of these cells in HER2+ breast cancer patients is associated with poor prognosis and response to trastuzumab. Functionally, upon trastuzumab stimulation, CD16+ fibroblasts reduce drug delivery by enhancing extracellular matrix stiffness. Interaction between trastuzumab and CD16 activates the intracellular SYK-VAV2-RhoA-ROCK-MLC2-MRTF-A pathway, leading to elevated contractile force and matrix production. Targeting of a Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor, VAV2, which is indispensable for the function of CD16 in fibroblasts rather than leukocytes, reverses desmoplasia provoked by CD16+ fibroblasts. Collectively, our study reveals a role for the fibroblast FcγR in drug resistance, and suggests that VAV2 is an attractive target to augment the effects of antibody treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Fatty acids (FAs) are widely involved in diverse biological functions. In mice with myeloid-specific deletion of fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5), OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation (AAI) is significantly exacerbated by increasing alternatively activated macrophages (M2). Fabp5 deficiency increases IL-4-induced M2 in vitro. In macrophages, Fabp5 deletion causes significant accumulation of free long-chain unsaturated FAs, such as oleic acid, but does not cause detectable changes to other groups of FAs. Interestingly, excessive uptake of oleic acid aggravates AAI pathogenesis, with increased M2 polarization in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Informatics and mechanistic studies indicate that Fabp5 deficiency may reprogram metabolic pathways by enhancing FA β oxidation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, in addition to producing more ATP through activation of the PPARγ signaling pathway, reshaping macrophages in favor of M2 polarization. These results emphasize the importance of FABP5 and oleic acid in AAI, suggesting preventive and therapeutic strategies for allergic asthma.

Abstract: For proper function of proteins, their subcellular localization needs to be monitored and regulated in response to the changes in cellular demands. In this regard, dysregulation in the nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) of proteins is closely associated with the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. However, it remains unclear whether there exists an intrinsic regulatory pathway(s) that controls NCT of proteins either in a commonly shared manner or in a target-selectively different manner. To dissect between these possibilities, in the current study, we investigated the molecular mechanism regulating NCT of truncated ataxin-3 (ATXN3) proteins of which genetic mutation leads to a type of polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, in comparison with that of TDP-43. In Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons, we observed dynamic changes in the subcellular localization of truncated ATXN3 proteins between the nucleus and the cytosol during development. Moreover, ectopic neuronal toxicity was induced by truncated ATXN3 proteins upon their nuclear accumulation. Consistent with a previous study showing intracellular calcium-dependent NCT of TDP-43, NCT of ATXN3 was also regulated by intracellular calcium level and involves Importin α3 (Imp α3). Interestingly, NCT of ATXN3, but not TDP-43, was primarily mediated by CBP. We further showed that acetyltransferase activity of CBP is important for NCT of ATXN3, which may acetylate Imp α3 to regulate NCT of ATXN3. These findings demonstrate that CBP-dependent acetylation of Imp α3 is crucial for intracellular calcium-dependent NCT of ATXN3 proteins, different from that of TDP-43, in Drosophila neurons.
