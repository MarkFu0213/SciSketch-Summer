Abstract: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have various uses in drug toxicity, as they can be easily differentiated in vitro. However, one of the major obstacles in the assessment of these differentiated cells is the presence of a heterogeneous cell population. To circumvent this problem, purified ESC-derived desired cells by means of the tissue-specific GFP and/or antibiotic resistance gene expression has been proposed. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the role of doxorubicin (DOX) in cardiotoxicity by using genetically engineered purified ESC-derived cardiomyocytes under the control alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. The results revealed that ESCs are suitable for evaluation of DOX cardiotoxicity. This study showed that DOX cardiotoxicity was reduced as detected by beating cardiomyocytes and caspase activity only by pretreatment with dexamethasone (DEX), not during or post-DOX treatment. DEX influence appears to be mediated via glucocorticoid receptor and enhances cardiomyocyte-specific gene expression. Therefore, for the general assessment of cytotoxicity, non-genetically engineered ESC-derived cardiomyocytes are sufficient but for the molecular assessment of DOX-induced toxicity, genetically engineered purified ESC-derived cardiomyocytes are necessary.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular information processing via reversible protein phosphorylation requires tight control of the localization, activity, and substrate specificity of protein kinases, which to a large extent is accomplished by complex formation with other proteins. Despite their critical role in cellular regulation and pathogenesis, protein interaction information is available for only a subset of the 518 human protein kinases. Here we present a global proteomic analysis of complexes of the human CMGC kinase group. In addition to subgroup-specific functional enrichment and modularity, the identified 652 high-confidence kinase-protein interactions provide a specific biochemical context for many poorly studied CMGC kinases. Furthermore, the analysis revealed a kinase-kinase subnetwork and candidate substrates for CMGC kinases. Finally, the presented interaction proteome uncovered a large set of interactions with proteins genetically linked to a range of human diseases, including cancer, suggesting additional routes for analyzing the role of CMGC kinases in controlling human disease pathways.

Chimeras Reveal a Single Lipid-Interface Residue that Controls MscL Channel Kinetics as well as Mechanosensitivity,

Abstract: Summary
MscL, the highly conserved bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, serves as an osmotic “emergency release valve,” is among the best-studied mechanosensors, and is a paradigm of how a channel senses and responds to membrane tension. Although all homologs tested thus far encode channel activity, many show functional differences. We tested Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus chimeras and found that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly E. coli I49 and the equivalent S. aureus F47 at the periplasmic lipid-aqueous interface of the first transmembrane domain, drastically influences both the open dwell time and the threshold of channel opening. One mutant shows a severe hysteresis, confirming the importance of this residue in determining the energy barriers for channel gating. We propose that this site acts similarly to a spring for a clasp knife, adjusting the resistance for obtaining and stabilizing an open or closed channel structure.

Abstract: Summary
Chromosomes with multiple DNA replication origins are a hallmark of Eukaryotes and some Archaea. All eukaryal nuclear replication origins are defined by the origin recognition complex (ORC) that recruits the replicative helicase MCM(2-7) via Cdc6 and Cdt1. We find that the three origins in the single chromosome of the archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus are specified by distinct initiation factors. While two origins are dependent on archaeal homologs of eukaryal Orc1 and Cdc6, the third origin is instead reliant on an archaeal Cdt1 homolog. We exploit the nonessential nature of the orc1-1 gene to investigate the role of ATP binding and hydrolysis in initiator function in vivo and in vitro. We find that the ATP-bound form of Orc1-1 is proficient for replication and implicates hydrolysis of ATP in downregulation of origin activity. Finally, we reveal that ATP and DNA binding by Orc1-1 remodels the protein’s structure rather than that of the DNA template.

Abstract: NeuroD is required for the survival of many subtypes of developing neurons in the vertebrate central nervous system. Because NeuroD-deficient neurons in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and inner ear die prematurely in the early stage of neurogenesis, the role of NeuroD during the later stages of neurogenesis of these cell subtypes is not well understood. In addition, the mechanism of NeuroD-deficient neuronal death has not been investigated. It was hypothesized that NeuroD-dependent neuronal death occurs through a Bax-dependent apoptotic pathway. Based on this hypothesis, this study attempted to rescue neuronal cell death by deleting the Bax gene in NeuroD null mice to investigate the role of NeuroD in surviving neurons. The NeuroD and Bax double null mice displayed a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus and the cerebellum and the rescue of vestibulo-cochlear ganglion (VCG) neurons that failed to migrate and innervate. In addition, at E13.5, the NeuroD-/-Bax-/- VCG neurons failed to express TrkB and TrkC, which are known to be essential for the survival of those neurons. These data suggest that neuronal death in NeuroD null mice is mediated by Bax-dependent apoptosis and that NeuroD is required for the migration of VCG neurons. Finally, these data show that TrkB and TrkC expression in E13.5 VCG neurons requires NeuroD and that TrkB and TrkC expression may be necessary for the normal migration and innervations of those neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic gene deregulation in cancer commonly occurs through chromatin repression and promoter hypermethylation of tumor-associated genes. However, the mechanism underpinning epigenetic-based gene activation in carcinogenesis is still poorly understood. Here, we identify a mechanism of domain gene deregulation through coordinated long-range epigenetic activation (LREA) of regions that typically span 1 Mb and harbor key oncogenes, microRNAs, and cancer biomarker genes. Gene promoters within LREA domains are characterized by a gain of active chromatin marks and a loss of repressive marks. Notably, although promoter hypomethylation is uncommon, we show that extensive DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands or “CpG-island borders” is strongly related to cancer-specific gene activation or differential promoter usage. These findings have wide ramifications for cancer diagnosis, progression, and epigenetic-based gene therapies.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical studies of Harderian gland, cecal tonsil and trachea of various groups of broiler chickens and the response of Baby Chick Ranikhet Disease Vaccines (BCRDV) on the mobilization of Igs-cells during postnatal development of organs was investigated in the Dept. of Anatomy and Histology, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh. In this study twelve chickens were grouped into vaccinated broilers (D14 and D28) which had received vaccines first at D3 of age and a booster dose given at D13; and non-vaccinated broilers (D1) which had not been vaccinated. In this study, it was observed that the frequency and distribution of Igs-positive cells were higher at D14 and at D28 rather than D1. Among Igs-positive cells, the IgG-positive cells were significantly higher than IgM and IgA-positive cells in the Harderian gland of D14 and D28 groups of chickens, however, in day-old chickens, the frequency of IgM-positive cells in this gland were greater. In the cecal tonsil, the frequency and distribution of IgG-positive cells were significantly higher than IgA- and IgM-positive cells both at D14 and D28 ages of chicken. On the other hand, in day-old chickens, the frequency and distribution of IgA-positive cells were insignificantly greater, followed by IgM and IgG-positive cells. In the trachea, few immunoglobulin-containing plasma cells were distributed in the subepithelial layer. IgM-positive cells were higher followed by IgG and IgA-positive cells in the trachea in D14 and D28 groups of chickens. In the same organ, IgG-positive plasma cells were greater than IgA and IgM-positive cells at one-day old. When the data for Harderian gland, cecal tonsil and trachea were compared statistically, it was observed that Igs-positive cells were statistically more common in cecal tonsils in day old chickens, and with the advancement of age, Igs-positive cells were found more in the Harderian gland. In conclusion, with the advancement of age in chickens the Harderian gland uptake is a function of the cecal tonsil due to its functional atrophy.

Fas/CD95-Induced Chemokines Can Serve as “Find-Me” Signals for Apoptotic Cells,

Abstract: Summary
Apoptosis is commonly thought to represent an immunologically silent or even anti-inflammatory mode of cell death, resulting in cell clearance in the absence of explicit activation of the immune system. However, here we show that Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis is associated with the production of an array of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, MCP-1, and GMCSF. Fas-induced production of MCP-1 and IL-8 promoted chemotaxis of phagocytes toward apoptotic cells, suggesting that these factors serve as “find-me” signals in this context. We also show that RIPK1 and IAPs are required for optimal production of cytokines and chemokines in response to Fas receptor stimulation. Consequently, a synthetic IAP antagonist potently suppressed Fas-dependent expression of multiple proinflammatory mediators and inhibited Fas-induced chemotaxis. Thus, in addition to provoking apoptosis, Fas receptor stimulation can trigger the secretion of chemotactic factors and other immunologically active proteins that can influence immune responsiveness toward dying cells.

Abstract: Summary
The fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling network plays an important role in cell growth, survival, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Deregulation of FGFR signaling can lead to cancer development. Here, we report an FGFR inhibitor, SSR128129E (SSR), that binds to the extracellular part of the receptor. SSR does not compete with FGF for binding to FGFR but inhibits FGF-induced signaling linked to FGFR internalization in an allosteric manner, as shown by crystallography studies, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, structure-activity relationship analysis, and FGFR mutagenesis. Overall, SSR is a small molecule allosteric inhibitor of FGF/FGFR signaling, acting via binding to the extracellular part of the FGFR.

Abstract: Summary
Morphogenesis of the respiratory appendages on eggshells of Drosophila species provides a powerful experimental system for studying how cell sheets give rise to complex three-dimensional structures. In Drosophila melanogaster, each of the two tubular eggshell appendages is derived from a primordium comprising two distinct cell types. Using live imaging and three-dimensional image reconstruction, we demonstrate that the transformation of this two-dimensional primordium into a tube involves out-of-plane bending followed by a sequence of spatially ordered cell intercalations. These morphological transformations correlate with the appearance of complementary distributions of myosin and Bazooka in the primordium. These distributions suggest that a two-dimensional pattern of line tensions along cell-cell edges on the apical side of the epithelium is sufficient to produce the observed changes in morphology. Computational modeling shows that this mechanism could explain the main features of tissue deformation and cell rearrangements observed during three-dimensional morphogenesis.

Feedforward Regulation Ensures Stability and Rapid Reversibility of a Cellular State,

Abstract: Summary
Cellular transitions are important for all life. Such transitions, including cell fate decisions, often employ positive feedback regulation to establish and stabilize new cellular states. However, positive feedback is unlikely to underlie stable cell-cycle arrest in yeast exposed to mating pheromone because the signaling pathway is linear, rather than bistable, over a broad range of extracellular pheromone concentration. We show that the stability of the pheromone-arrested state results from coherent feedforward regulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor Far1. This network motif is effectively isolated from the more complex regulatory network in which it is embedded. Fast regulation of Far1 by phosphorylation allows rapid cell-cycle arrest and reentry, whereas slow Far1 synthesis reinforces arrest. We expect coherent feedforward regulation to be frequently implemented at reversible cellular transitions because this network motif can achieve the ostensibly conflicting aims of arrest stability and rapid reversibility without loss of signaling information.

Abstract: Summary
In developing limb skin, peripheral nerves provide a spatial template that controls the branching pattern and differentiation of arteries. Our previous studies indicate that nerve-derived VEGF-A is required for arterial differentiation but not for nerve-vessel alignment. In this study, we demonstrate that nerve-vessel alignment depends on the activity of Cxcl12-Cxcr4 chemokine signaling. Genetic inactivation of Cxcl12-Cxcr4 signaling perturbs nerve-vessel alignment and abolishes arteriogenesis. Further in vitro assays allow us to uncouple nerve-vessel alignment and arteriogenesis, revealing that nerve-derived Cxcl12 stimulates endothelial cell migration, whereas nerve-derived VEGF-A is responsible for arterial differentiation. These findings suggest a coordinated sequential action in which nerve Cxcl12 functions over a distance to recruit vessels to align with nerves, and subsequent arterial differentiation presumably requires a local action of nerve VEGF-A in the nerve-associated vessels.

Abstract: Summary
Inferring antibiotic mechanisms on translation through static structures has been challenging, as biological systems are highly dynamic. Dynamic single-molecule methods are also limited to few simultaneously measurable parameters. We have circumvented these limitations with a multifaceted approach to investigate three structurally distinct aminoglycosides that bind to the aminoacyl-transfer RNA site (A site) in the prokaryotic 30S ribosomal subunit: apramycin, paromomycin, and gentamicin. Using several single-molecule fluorescence measurements combined with structural and biochemical techniques, we observed distinct changes to translational dynamics for each aminoglycoside. While all three drugs effectively inhibit translation elongation, their actions are structurally and mechanistically distinct. Apramycin does not displace A1492 and A1493 at the decoding center, as demonstrated by a solution nuclear magnetic resonance structure, causing only limited miscoding; instead, it primarily blocks translocation. Paromomycin and gentamicin, which displace A1492 and A1493, cause significant miscoding, block intersubunit rotation, and inhibit translocation. Our results show the power of combined dynamics, structural, and biochemical approaches to elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying translation and its inhibition.

Abstract: It is well known that the karyotype of animal cells cultured in vitro tends to become aneuploid as the culture ages. Aneuploidy can cause genetic instability, alter the biological properties of cells, and affect their application in genetic studies and cell engineering. Understanding the causes and mechanisms of aneuploidy is primary to control its occurrence in cultured cells, and is also helpful to understand the mechanisms of tumorigenesis because aneuploidy is a hallmark of tumor cells. This review underscores the potential role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) toxicity in spontaneous aneuploidy of cultured cells. The underlying mechanisms and possible sources of ROS are also discussed.

Abstract: Summary
Vibrio parahaemolyticus type III secretion system 2 (T3SS2) is essential for the organism’s virulence, but the effectors required for intestinal colonization and induction of diarrhea by this pathogen have not been identified. Here, we identify a type III secretion system (T3SS2)-secreted effector, VopZ, that is essential for V. parahaemolyticus pathogenicity. VopZ plays distinct, genetically separable roles in enabling intestinal colonization and diarrheagenesis. Truncation of VopZ prevents V. parahaemolyticus colonization, whereas deletion of VopZ amino acids 38–62 abrogates V. parahaemolyticus-induced diarrhea and intestinal pathology but does not impair colonization. VopZ inhibits activation of the kinase TAK1 and thereby prevents the activation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways, which lie downstream. In contrast, the VopZ internal deletion mutant cannot counter the activation of pathways regulated by TAK1. Collectively, our findings suggest that VopZ’s inhibition of TAK1 is critical for V. parahaemolyticus to induce diarrhea and intestinal pathology.

Abstract: Summary
TDP-43 proteinopathy is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and related neurodegenerative disorders. Whether TDP-43 neurotoxicity is caused by a novel toxic gain-of-function mechanism of the aggregates or by a loss of its normal function is unknown. We increased and decreased expression of TDP-43 (dTDP-43) in Drosophila. Although upregulation of dTDP-43 induced neuronal ubiquitin and dTDP-43-positive inclusions, both up- and downregulated dTDP-43 resulted in selective apoptosis of bursicon neurons and highly similar transcriptome alterations at the pupal-adult transition. Gene network analysis and genetic validation showed that both up- and downregulated dTDP-43 directly and dramatically increased the expression of the neuronal microtubule-associated protein Map205, resulting in cytoplasmic accumulations of the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) and a failure to switch EcR-dependent gene programs from a pupal to adult pattern. We propose that dTDP-43 neurotoxicity is caused by a loss of its normal function.

Abstract: Summary
Comprehensive discovery of genetic mechanisms of drug resistance and identification of in vivo drug targets represent significant challenges. Here we present a functional variomics technology in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This tool analyzes numerous genetic variants and effectively tackles both problems simultaneously. Using this tool, we discovered almost all genes that, due to mutations or modest overexpression, confer resistance to rapamycin, cycloheximide, and amphotericin B. Most significant among the resistance genes were drug targets, including multiple targets of a given drug. With amphotericin B, we discovered the highly conserved membrane protein Pmp3 as a potent resistance factor and a possible target. Widespread application of this tool should allow rapid identification of conserved resistance mechanisms and targets of many more compounds. New genes and alleles that confer resistance to other stresses can also be discovered. Similar tools in other systems, such as human cell lines, will also be useful.

Abstract: Summary
Deficiencies in factors that regulate the DNA damage response enhance the incidence of malignancy by destabilizing the genome. However, the precise influence of the DNA damage response on regulation of cancer-associated rearrangements is not well defined. Here we examine the genome-wide impact of tumor protein P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) deficiency in lymphoma and translocation. While both activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and 53BP1 have been associated with cancer in humans, neither AID overexpression nor loss of 53BP1 is sufficient to produce malignancy. However, the combination of 53BP1 deficiency and AID deregulation results in B cell lymphoma. Deep sequencing of the genome of 53BP1−/− cancer cells and translocation capture sequencing (TC-Seq) of primary 53BP1−/− B cells revealed that their chromosomal rearrangements differ from those found in wild-type cells in that they show increased DNA end resection. Moreover, loss of 53BP1 alters the translocatome by increasing rearrangements to intergenic regions.

Abstract: Arginase II catalyzes the conversion of arginine to urea and ornithine in many extrahepatic tissues. We investigated the protective role of arginase II on lipopolysaccha-ride-mediated apoptosis in the macrophage cells. Adenoviral gene transfer of full length of arginase II was performed in the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. The role of arginase II was investigated with cell viability, cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation assay, arginase activity, nitric oxide production, and Western blot analysis. Arginase II is localized in mitochondria of macrophage cells, and the expression of arginase II was increased by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS significantly increased cell death which was inhibited by AMT, a specific inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor. In contrast, LPS-induced cell death and nitric oxide production were increased by 2-boronoethyl-L-cysteine, a specific inhibitor of arginase. Adenoviral overexpression of arginase II significantly inhibited LPS-induced cell death and cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation. LPS-induced iNOS expression and poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage were significantly suppressed by arginase II overexpression. Furthermore, arginase II overexpression resulted in a decrease in the Bax protein level and the reverse induction of Bcl-2 protein. Our data demonstrated that inhibition of NO production by arginase II may be due to arginine depletion as well as iNOS suppression though its reaction products. Moreover, arginase II plays a protective role of LPS-induced apoptosis in RAW264.7 cells.

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a Ca2+ storing organelle that plays a critical role in the synthesis, folding and post-translational modifications of many proteins. The ER enters into a condition of stress when the load of newly synthesized proteins exceeds its folding and processing capacity. This activates a signal transduction pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR) that attempts to restore homeostasis. The precise role of ER Ca2+ in the initiation of the UPR has not been defined. Specifically, it has not been established whether ER Ca2+ dysregulation is a cause or consequence of ER stress. Here, we report that partial depletion of ER Ca2+ stores induces a significant induction of the UPR, and leads to the retention of a normally secreted protein Carboxypeptidase Y. Moreover, inhibition of protein glycosylation by tunicamycin rapidly induced an ER Ca2+ leak into the cytosol. However, blockade of the translocon with emetine inhibited the tunicamycin-induced Ca2+ release. Furthermore, emetine treatment blocked elF2α phosphorylation and reduced expression of the chaperone BiP. These findings suggest that Ca2+ may be both a cause and a consequence of ER protein misfolding. Thus, it appears that ER Ca2+ leak is a significant co-factor for the initiation of the UPR.

Abstract: Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are integrated into the genomes of all pigs. Since some PERVs can also infect human cells, they represent a potential risk for xenotransplantation involving pig cells or organs. The long terminal repeat (LTR) elements of PERVs show promoter activity that can affect human functional genes; therefore, we examined these elements in this study. We detected several expressed LTRs in the NIH-miniature pig liver, among which we identified 9 different subtypes. When these LTRs were compared, distinct structures that contained several insertion and deletion (INDEL) events and tandem repeats were identified in the U3 region. The transcriptional activity of the 9 LTR subtypes was analyzed in the PK15 porcine cell line and in the HepG2 and Hep3B human liver cell lines, and transcriptional regulation was found to be different in the 3 cell lines. The D LTR subtype was found to have stronger promoter activity than all other types in 4 different human cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, U251, and 293). Using computational approaches, the D type was shown to contain 4 transcription factor-binding sites distinct from those in the U3 regions of the other subtypes. Therefore, deletion mutants were constructed and examined by a transient transfection luciferase assay. The results of this analysis indicated that the binding site for the Hand1:E47 transcription factor might play a positive role in the transcriptional regulation of PERV LTR subtype D in human liver cell lines.

Abstract: Mammary cancer is the most common tumor in female dogs. Canine mammary tumor serves as an excellent model for human breast cancer biology. Cancer cell lines are routinely used as the source of protein for proteomics studies because antigen homogeneity is essential for protein profiling of tumors. In this study, we sought to isolate and characterize a canine mammary cell line that was subject to protein profiling analysis through 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) method. Mammary tumor was collected from a 6-year-old terrier dog. Tumor fragments were treated with collagenase, and dissociated cells were cultured. The cell line was subcultured over 50 times. Characterization profile included population doubling time, colony forming assay, spheroid formation/migration potency, immunocytochemistry for steroid receptors and intermediate filaments, karyotyping, RT-PCR for cytokeratins 8, 14, and 18, and 2-DE pattern. The cell line revealed three growth phases including normal, dormant, and immortal phase. Immunocytochemistry showed that the cell line was positive for estrogen receptor, pancytokeratin, cytokeratin-low and vimentin, and negative for progesterone receptor, cytokeratin-high. RT-PCR supported the immunocytochemistry results. 2-DE pattern and proteome analysis of the cell line revealed that protein composition was stable, indicating the cell line as an appropriate source of protein for canine mammary proteomics studies.

Abstract: Summary
Using sequential gene expression profiling (GEP) samples, we defined a major functional group related to drug resistance that contains chromosomal instability (CIN) genes. One CIN gene in particular, NEK2, was highly correlated with drug resistance, rapid relapse, and poor outcome in multiple cancers. Overexpressing NEK2 in cancer cells resulted in enhanced CIN, cell proliferation and drug resistance, while targeting NEK2 by NEK2 shRNA overcame cancer cell drug resistance and induced apoptosis in vitro and in a xenograft myeloma mouse model. High expression of NEK2 induced drug resistance mainly through activation of the efflux pumps. Thus, NEK2 represents a strong predictor for drug resistance and poor prognosis in cancer and could be an important target for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are targets for anticancer drug development. To date, only RTK inhibitors that block orthosteric binding of ligands and substrates have been developed. Here, we report the pharmacologic characterization of the chemical SSR128129E (SSR), which inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling by binding to the extracellular FGFR domain without affecting orthosteric FGF binding. SSR exhibits allosteric properties, including probe dependence, signaling bias, and ceiling effects. Inhibition by SSR is highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Oral delivery of SSR inhibits arthritis and tumors that are relatively refractory to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 antibodies. Thus, orally active, extracellularly acting small-molecule modulators of RTKs with allosteric properties can be developed and may offer opportunities to improve anticancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Posttranslational modification with small ubiquitin-like modifier (Sumo) regulates numerous cellular and developmental processes. Sumoylation is dynamic with deconjugation by Sumo-specific proteases (Senps) regulating steady-state levels. Different Senps are found in distinct subcellular domains, which may limit their deconjugation activity to colocalizing Sumo-modified proteins. In vitro, Senps can discriminate between the different Sumo paralogs: Sumo1 versus the highly related Sumo2 and Sumo3 (Sumo2/3), which can form poly-Sumo chains. However, a full understanding of Senp specificity in vivo is still lacking. Here, using biochemical and genetic approaches, we establish that Senp1 has an essential, nonredundant function to desumoylate Sumo1-modified proteins during mouse embryonic development. Senp1 specificity for Sumo1 conjugates represents an intrinsic function and not simply a product of colocalization. In contrast, Senp1 has only a limited role in Sumo2/3 desumoylation, although it may regulate Sumo1-mediated termination of poly-Sumo2/3 chains.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) catalyzes lysine 119 monoubiquitylation on H2A (H2AK119ub1) and regulates pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the mechanisms controlling the binding of PRC1 to genomic sites and its catalytic activity are poorly understood. Here, we show that Fbxl10 interacts with Ring1B and Nspc1, forming a noncanonical PRC1 that is required for H2AK119ub1 in mouse ESCs. Genome-wide analyses reveal that Fbxl10 preferentially binds to CpG islands and colocalizes with Ring1B on Polycomb target genes. Notably, Fbxl10 depletion causes a decrease in Ring1B binding to target genes and a major loss of H2AK119ub1. Furthermore, genetic analyses demonstrate that Fbxl10 DNA binding capability and integration into PRC1 are required for H2AK119 ubiquitylation. ESCs lacking Fbxl10, like previously characterized Polycomb mutants, cannot differentiate properly. These results demonstrate that Fbxl10 has a key role in regulating Ring1B recruitment to its target genes and H2AK119 ubiquitylation in ESCs.

Abstract: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated by upstream kinases and negatively regulated by protein phosphatases. Intracellular calcium mediates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is in a heterotrimeric complex with the PR72 subunit. The PR72 subunit contains two calcium-binding sites formed by EF hands. Our previous study has shown that chronic calcium exposure decreases AMPK activity. To define the specific molecular mechanism whereby calcium can deactivate AMPK, activities of AMPK and PP2A were analyzed in C2C12 muscle cell cultures and skeletal muscle tissues from mutant pigs possessing the AMPKγ3-mutation or the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) calcium gating mutation, or both. C2C12 myotubes treated with calcium releasing agent (caffeine) for 10h decreased (P<0.05) AICAR-induced AMPK activity to control levels and this negative effect was eliminated by ryanodine receptor stabilizer, dantrolene. Interestingly, muscle from pigs with the RyR1 mutation and C2C12 cells administered with 10h caffeine showed higher (P<0.05) PP2A activity compared to controls. More importantly, the inhibitory effect of caffeine on AMPK activity was attenuated by the PP2A inhibitor, calyculin A or siRNA induced knockdown of PP2A. These data show the inhibitory effect of chronic calcium on AMPK activity is exerted through the activation of PP2A.

Abstract: Summary
As solid tumors expand, oxygen and nutrients become limiting owing to inadequate vascularization and diffusion. How malignant cells cope with this potentially lethal metabolic stress remains poorly understood. We found that glucose shortage associated with malignant progression triggers apoptosis through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR). ER stress is in part caused by reduced glucose flux through the hexosamine pathway. Deletion of the proapoptotic UPR effector CHOP in a mouse model of K-rasG12V-induced lung cancer increases tumor incidence, strongly supporting the notion that ER stress serves as a barrier to malignancy. Overcoming this barrier requires the selective attenuation of the PERK-CHOP arm of the UPR by the molecular chaperone p58IPK. Furthermore, p58IPK-mediated adaptive response enables cells to benefit from the protective features of chronic UPR. Altogether, these results show that ER stress activation and p58IPK expression control the fate of malignant cells facing glucose shortage.

Abstract: Summary
The HES proteins are known Notch effectors and have long been recognized as important in inhibiting neuronal differentiation. However, the roles that they play in the specification of neuronal fate remain largely unknown. Here, we show that in the differentiating retinal epithelium, the proneural protein ATOH7 (ATH5) is required for the activation of the transcription of the Hes5.3 gene before the penultimate mitosis of progenitor cells. We further show that the HES5.3 protein slows down the cell-cycle progression of Atoh7-expressing cells, thereby establishing conditions for Atoh7 to reach a high level of expression in S phase and induce neuronal differentiation prior to the ultimate mitosis. Our study uncovers how a proneural protein recruits a protein known to be a component of the Notch signaling pathway in order to regulate the transition between an initial phase of selection among uncommitted progenitors and a later phase committing the selected progenitors to neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Classic cardio-metabolic risk factors such as hypertension, stroke, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia all increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. We found increased transcription of β-secretase/BACE1, the rate-limiting enzyme for Aβ generation, in eNOS-deficient mouse brains and after feeding mice a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet. Up- or downregulation of PGC-1α reciprocally regulated BACE1 in vitro and in vivo. Modest fasting in mice reduced BACE1 transcription in the brains, which was accompanied by elevated PGC-1 expression and activity. Moreover, the suppressive effect of PGC-1 was dependent on activated PPARγ, likely via SIRT1-mediated deacetylation in a ligand-independent manner. The BACE1 promoter contains multiple PPAR-RXR sites, and direct interactions among SIRT1-PPARγ-PGC-1 at these sites were enhanced with fasting. The interference on the BACE1 gene identified here represents a unique noncanonical mechanism of PPARγ-PGC-1 in transcriptional repression in neurons in response to metabolic signals that may involve recruitment of corepressor NCoR.

Abstract: The microanatomy of the digestive and respiratory systems of the holothurian Cladolabes schmeltzii was studied. The digestive tube of C. schmeltzii is divided into seven parts. The pharynx, esophagus, and stomach are lined with cuticular immersed epithelium. In these regions, the epithelial cells are connected via desmosomes, septate junctions, and rivet-like structures. The presence of the cuticle and rivet-like structures suggests an ectodermal origin for these parts of the digestive tube. The luminal intestinal epithelium is formed by vesicular enterocytes, which have different structures in different intestinal regions. Moreover, the epithelium of the first descending part of the intestine contains the granular enterocytes. The respiratory system consists of paired respiratory trees lined by a luminal epithelium that is formed by cells of irregular shape. The apical surface of these epithelial cells has few lamellae. The cells are connected to each other through a system of intercellular junctions, consisting of both desmosomes and well-developed septate junctions. The coelomic epithelium of the intestine and the respiratory trees consists of peritoneal and myoepithelial cells.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulating evidence suggests that many brain diseases are associated with defects in neuronal migration, suggesting that this step of neurogenesis is critical for brain organization. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal migration remain largely unknown. Here, we identified the zinc-finger transcriptional repressor RP58 as a key regulator of neuronal migration via multipolar-to-bipolar transition. RP58−/− neurons exhibited severe defects in the formation of leading processes and never shifted to the locomotion mode. Cre-mediated deletion of RP58 using in utero electroporation in RP58flox/flox mice revealed that RP58 functions in cell-autonomous multipolar-to-bipolar transition, independent of cell-cycle exit. Finally, we found that RP58 represses Ngn2 transcription to regulate the Ngn2-Rnd2 pathway; Ngn2 knockdown rescued migration defects of the RP58−/− neurons. Our findings highlight the critical role of RP58 in multipolar-to-bipolar transition via suppression of the Ngn2-Rnd2 pathway in the developing cerebral cortex.

Abstract: Summary
How the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activates some genes while potently repressing others remains an open question. There are three current models for suppression: transrepression via GR tethering to AP-1/NF-κB sites, direct GR association with inhibitory elements (nGREs), and GR recruitment of the corepressor GRIP1. To gain insights into GR suppression, we used genomic analyses and genome-wide profiling of GR, p65, and c-Jun in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We show that GR mediates both activation and repression at tethered sites, GREs, and GRIP1-bound elements, indicating that motif classification is insufficient to predict regulatory polarity of GR binding. Interestingly, sites of GR repression utilize GRIP1's corepressor function and display reduced histone acetylation. Together, these findings suggest that while GR occupancy confers hormone responsiveness, the receptor itself may not participate in the regulatory effects. Furthermore, transcriptional outcome is not established by sequence but is influenced by epigenetic regulators, context, and other unrecognized regulatory determinants.

Abstract: Summary
Plants have a remarkable potential for sustained (indeterminate) postembryonic growth. Following their specification in the early embryo, tissue-specific precursor cells first establish tissues and later maintain them postembryonically. The mechanisms underlying these processes are largely unknown. Here we define local control of oriented, periclinal cell division as the mechanism underlying both the establishment and maintenance of vascular tissue. We identify an auxin-regulated basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor dimer as a critical regulator of vascular development. Due to a loss of periclinal divisions, vascular tissue gradually disappears in bHLH-deficient mutants; conversely, ectopic expression is sufficient for triggering periclinal divisions. We show that this dimer operates independently of tissue identity but is restricted to a small vascular domain by integrating overlapping transcription patterns of the interacting bHLH proteins. Our work reveals a common mechanism for tissue establishment and indeterminate vascular development and provides a conceptual framework for developmental control of local cell divisions.

Abstract: Summary
It remains controversial whether the highly homologous ribosomal protein (RP) paralogs found in lower eukaryotes have distinct functions and this has not been explored in vertebrates. Here we demonstrate that despite ubiquitous expression, the RP paralogs, Rpl22 and Rpl22-like1 (Rpl22l1) play essential, distinct, and antagonistic roles in hematopoietic development. Knockdown of Rpl22 in zebrafish embryos selectively blocks the development of T lineage progenitors after they have seeded the thymus. In contrast, knockdown of the Rpl22 paralog, Rpl22l1, impairs the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros by abrogating Smad1 expression and the consequent induction of essential transcriptional regulator, Runx1. Indeed, despite the ability of both paralogs to bind smad1 RNA, Rpl22 and Rpl22l1 have opposing effects on Smad1 expression. Accordingly, circumstances that tip the balance of these paralogs in favor of Rpl22 (e.g., Rpl22l1 knockdown or Rpl22 overexpression) result in repression of Smad1 and blockade of HSC emergence.

Abstract: Summary
A central enigma in epigenetics is how epigenetic factors are guided to specific genomic sites for their function. Previously, we reported that a Piwi-piRNA complex associates with the piRNA-complementary site in the Drosophila genome and regulates its epigenetic state. Here, we report that Piwi-piRNA complexes bind to numerous piRNA-complementary sequences throughout the genome, implicating piRNAs as a major mechanism that guides Piwi and Piwi-associated epigenetic factors to program the genome. To test this hypothesis, we demonstrate that inserting piRNA-complementary sequences to an ectopic site leads to Piwi, HP1a, and Su(var)3-9 recruitment to the site as well as H3K9me2/3 enrichment and reduced RNA polymerase II association, indicating that piRNA is both necessary and sufficient to recruit Piwi and epigenetic factors to specific genomic sites.

Abstract: Summary
Lysine methylation of histone proteins regulates chromatin dynamics and plays important roles in diverse physiological and pathological processes. However, beyond histone proteins, the proteome-wide extent of lysine methylation remains largely unknown. We have engineered the naturally occurring MBT domain repeats of L3MBTL1 to serve as a universal affinity reagent for detecting, enriching, and identifying proteins carrying a mono- or dimethylated lysine. The domain is broadly specific for methylated lysine (“pan-specific”) and can be applied to any biological system. We have used our approach to demonstrate that SIRT1 is a substrate of the methyltransferase G9a both in vitro and in cells, to perform proteome-wide detection and enrichment of methylated proteins, and to identify candidate in-cell substrates of G9a and the related methyltransferase GLP. Together, our results demonstrate a powerful new approach for global and quantitative analysis of methylated lysine, and they represent the first systems biology understanding of lysine methylation.

Abstract: Ca2+ and cAMP signalling pathways interact in a complex manner at multiple sites. This crosstalk fine-tunes the spatiotemporal patterns of Ca2+ and cAMP signals. In salivary glands of the blowfly Calliphora vicina fluid secretion is stimulated by serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) via activation of two different 5-HT receptors coupled to the InsP3/Ca2+ (Cv5-HT2α) or the cAMP pathway (Cv5-HT7), respectively. We have shown recently in permeabilized gland cells that cAMP sensitizes InsP3-induced Ca2+ release to InsP3. Here we study the effects of the cAMP signalling pathway on 5-HT-induced oscillations in transepithelial potential (TEP) and in intracellular [Ca2+]. We show: (1) Blocking the activation of the cAMP pathway by cinanserin suppresses the generation of TEP and Ca2+ oscillations, (2) application of 8-CPT-cAMP in the presence of cinanserin restores 5-HT-induced TEP and Ca2+ oscillations, (3) 8-CPT-cAMP sensitizes the InsP3/Ca2+ signalling pathway to 5-HT and the Cv5-HT2α receptor agonist 5-MeOT, (4) 8-CPT-cAMP induces Ca2+ oscillations in cells loaded with subthreshold concentrations of InsP3, (5) inhibition of protein kinase A by H-89 abolishes 5-HT-induced TEP and Ca2+ spiking and mimics the effect of cinanserin. These results suggest that activation of the cyclic AMP pathway promotes the generation of 5-HT-induced Ca2+ oscillations in blowfly salivary glands.

Abstract: The morphological and physiological properties of tight junctions (TJs) are determined by the combination and mixing ratios of claudin species. Mouse rectum carcinoma cell lines, CMT93-I and -II cells, expressed claudin-4, -6, -7, and -12, and CMT93-II cells further expressed claudin-2. Although there were no differences in the morphology and number of TJ strands between the two cell lines, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of CMT93-II cells was approximately one-seventh that of CMT93-I cells. In this study, we aimed to determine whether claudin-2 expression in CMT93-II cells caused the reduction of TER. Inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway by U0126 treatment for 24 and 48h in CMT93-II cells markedly decreased claudin-2 from the apical junctional region and increased TER. However, claudin-4, -6, and -7 were still continuously localized at the apical junctional region by U0126 treatment. Moreover, the claudin-2 expression recovered at the apical junctional region after the removal of U0126 and TER decreased almost to the baseline level. These results suggest that the ERK pathway positively regulates claudin-2 protein expression and claudin-2 is involved in lowering TER in CMT93-II cells.

Abstract: Summary
Faithful duplication of the genome in S phase followed by its accurate segregation in mitosis is essential to maintain genomic integrity. Recent studies have suggested that proteins involved in DNA transactions are also required for whole-chromosome stability. Here we demonstrate that the MRN (Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1) complex and CtIP are required for accurate chromosome segregation. Depletion of Mre11 or CtIP, antibody-mediated inhibition of Mre11, or small-molecule inhibition of MRN using mirin results in metaphase chromosome alignment defects in Xenopus egg extracts. Similarly, loss of MRN function adversely affects spindle assembly around DNA-coated beads in egg extracts. Inhibition of MRN function in mammalian cells triggers a metaphase delay and disrupts the RCC1-dependent RanGTP gradient. Addition of the Mre11 inhibitor mirin to egg extracts and mammalian cells reduces RCC1 association with mitotic chromosomes. Thus, the MRN-CtIP pathway contributes to Ran-dependent mitotic spindle assembly by modulating RCC1 chromosome association.

Abstract: Summary
The IL-6-triggered positive feedback loop for NFκB signaling (or the IL-6 amplifier/Inflammation amplifier) was originally discovered as a synergistic-activation signal that follows IL-17/IL-6 stimulation in nonimmune cells. Subsequent results from animal models have shown that the amplifier is activated by stimulation of NFκB and STAT3 and induces chemokines and inflammation via an NFκB loop. However, its role in human diseases is unclear. Here, we combined two genome-wide mouse screens with SNP-based disease association studies, revealing 1,700 genes related to the IL-6 amplifier, 202 of which showed 492 indications of association with ailments beyond autoimmune diseases. We followed up on ErbB1 from our list. Blocking ErbB1 signaling suppressed the IL-6 amplifier, whereas the expression of epiregulin, an ErbB1 ligand, was higher in patients with inflammatory diseases. These results indicate that the IL-6 amplifier is indeed associated with human diseases and disorders and that the identified genes may make for potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Necrotic death of macrophages has long been known to be present in atherosclerotic lesions but has not been studied. We examined the role of receptor interacting protein (RIP) 3, a mediator of necrotic cell death, in atherosclerosis and found that RIP3−/−;Ldlr−/− mice were no different from RIP3+/+;Ldlr−/− mice in early atherosclerosis but had significant reduction in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Similar results were observed in Apoe−/− background mice. Bone marrow transplantation revealed that loss of RIP3 expression from bone-marrow-derived cells is responsible for the reduced disease progression. While no difference was found in apoptosis between RIP3−/−;Ldlr−/− and RIP3+/+;Ldlr−/− mice, electron microscopy revealed a significant reduction of macrophage primary necrosis in the advanced lesions of RIP3−/− mice. In vitro cellular studies showed that RIP3 deletion had no effect on oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-induced macrophage apoptosis, but prevented macrophage primary necrosis occurring in response to oxidized LDL under caspase inhibition or RIP3 overexpression conditions. RIP3-dependent necrosis is not postapoptotic, and the increased primary necrosis in advanced atherosclerotic lesions most likely resulted from the increase of RIP3 expression. Our data demonstrate that primary necrosis of macrophages is proatherogenic during advanced atherosclerosis development.

Abstract: Adipocyte differentiation requires the coordinated activities of several nuclear transcription factors. Recently, mitochondria biogenesis was reported to occur during adipocyte differentiation and following treatment with thiazolidinediones in vitro and in vivo. Crif1 is a translational factor for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and is important for transcription of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex. To investigate the role of OXPHOS in adipogenesis, we analyzed adipocyte differentiation following disruption of Crif1 in vitro and in vivo. The adipose-specific Crif1 knockout mouse had a lower body weight and less fat mass than wild-type mice. Furthermore, adipocytes were smaller and had a dysplastic morphology in the adipose-specific Crif1 knockout mouse. 3T3-L1 adipocytes or adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) that lacked Crif1 expressed lower levels of mtDNA-encoded OXPHOS subunits, and adipocyte differentiation was disrupted. Rosiglitazone treatment did not induce adipogenesis or mitochondria biogenesis in Crif1 knockout ADSCs. These results show that mitochondrial OXPHOS and Crif1 are required for rosiglitazone- and hormone-induced adipogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Differences in global levels of histone acetylation occur in normal and cancer cells, although the reason why cells regulate these levels has been unclear. Here we demonstrate a role for histone acetylation in regulating intracellular pH (pHi). As pHi decreases, histones are globally deacetylated by histone deacetylases (HDACs), and the released acetate anions are coexported with protons out of the cell by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), preventing further reductions in pHi. Conversely, global histone acetylation increases as pHi rises, such as when resting cells are induced to proliferate. Inhibition of HDACs or MCTs decreases acetate export and lowers pHi, particularly compromising pHi maintenance in acidic environments. Global deacetylation at low pH is reflected at a genomic level by decreased abundance and extensive redistribution of acetylation throughout the genome. Thus, acetylation of chromatin functions as a rheostat to regulate pHi with important implications for mechanism of action and therapeutic use of HDAC inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Imatinib eradicates dividing progenitor cells of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but does not effectively target nondividing leukemia-initiating cells (LICs); thus, the disease often relapse after its discontinuation. We now show that Fbxw7 plays a pivotal role in maintenance of quiescence in LICs of CML by reducing the level of c-Myc. Abrogation of quiescence in LICs by Fbxw7 ablation increased their sensitivity to imatinib, and the combination of Fbxw7 ablation with imatinib treatment resulted in a greater depletion of LICs than of normal hematopoietic stem cells in mice. Purging of LICs by targeting Fbxw7 to interrupt their quiescence and subsequent treatment with imatinib may thus provide the basis for a promising therapeutic approach to CML.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin governs gene regulation and genome maintenance, yet a substantial fraction of the chromatin proteome is still unexplored. Moreover, a global model of the chromatin protein network is lacking. By screening >100 candidates we identify 42 Drosophila proteins that were not previously associated with chromatin, which all display specific genomic binding patterns. Bayesian network modeling of the binding profiles of these and 70 known chromatin components yields a detailed blueprint of the in vivo chromatin protein network. We demonstrate functional compartmentalization of this network, and predict functions for most of the previously unknown chromatin proteins, including roles in DNA replication and repair, and gene activation and repression.

Abstract: Summary
In breast cancer, nuclear receptors (NRs) play a prominent role in governing gene expression, have prognostic utility, and are therapeutic targets. We built a regulatory map for 24 NRs, six chromatin state markers, and 14 breast-cancer-associated transcription factors (TFs) that are expressed in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The resulting network reveals a highly interconnected regulatory matrix where extensive crosstalk occurs among NRs and other breast -cancer-associated TFs. We show that large numbers of factors are coordinately bound to highly occupied target regions throughout the genome, and these regions are associated with active chromatin state and hormone-responsive gene expression. This network also provides a framework for stratifying and predicting patient outcomes, and we use it to show that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta binds to a set of genes also regulated by the retinoic acid receptors and whose expression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer.

Abstract: Despite its wide use in toxicology, a detailed characterization of RTL-W1 cell line lagged behind leaving ambiguities about its cell origin. We aimed to better characterize the line regarding cell phenotype and tumorigenic state. We studied RTL-W1 cells in monolayers and in (4–22-week-old) aggregates considering: (a) morphology (light and electron microscopy); (b) immunophenotype using AE1/AE3, vimentin, Cam5.2, CK7 and CK19 and e-cadherin antibodies and (c) growth behavior. RTL-W1 organelle content is constituted basically by mitochondria and abundant free ribosomes, with no (cytochemically) detectable peroxisomes and lysosomes. Immunocytochemistry showed a strong marking for AE1/AE3 and vimentin (in a cell subset). Since AE1/AE3 stained biliary epithelial ducts in trout liver, and considering the morphological characteristics and long term culture, RTL-W1 cells seem more similar to bile preductular epithelial cells (considered as stem cells in teleost liver). Also, we observed abnormal nuclear features described for both malignant cell lines and stem cells, so we could not conclude about tumorigenicity. Cell aggregates had signs of hepatocytic differentiation, such as the development of RER and microvillus-like projections into intercellular spaces. The morphological resemblance to the original tissue suggests that aggregates could have an added value in metabolic as well as in cell-to-cell interaction studies.

Abstract: Summary
The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is important for the development of cancer metastases and organ fibrosis, conditions prevalent in aging. Because sirtuins affect the pathology of aging, we tested the effect of SirT1 on EMT. Reduced SIRT1 levels in HMLER breast cancer cells led to increased metastases in nude mice, and the loss of SIRT1 in kidney tubular epithelial cells exacerbated injury-induced kidney fibrosis. SIRT1 reduces EMT in cancer and fibrosis by deacetylating Smad4 and repressing the effect of TGF-β signaling on MMP7, a Smad4 target gene. Consequently, less E-cadherin is cleaved from the cell surface and β-catenin remains bound to E-cadherin at the cell-cell junctions. Our findings suggest that the SIRT1/Smad4/β-catenin axis may be a target for diseases driven by EMT.

Abstract: The cumulus mass is a group of cells surrounding the oocyte. Cumulus cells are known to play a role in a number of reproductive events including oocyte maturation and acrosome reaction. Calcium mobilization in cumulus cells has been implicated in the process of oocyte maturation and acrosome reaction; however, its exact role remains elusive. In this review, we summarize the findings on Ca2+ mobilization in cumulus cells, with particular focus on (1) the gonadotropin/paracrine factors-induced cumulus Ca2+ mobilization and its downstream signaling pathways in oocyte maturation and (2) the sperm-derived factors-induced cumulus Ca2+ mobilization in the cross-talk between cumulus and sperm and thus acrosome reaction. The evidence suggests that as an important signaling event, Ca2+ mobilization in cumulus cells is important to germ cell development and function, and thus essential to fertilization and reproduction.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are centers of metabolism and signaling whose content and function must adapt to changing cellular environments. The biological signals that initiate mitochondrial restructuring and the cellular processes that drive this adaptive response are largely obscure. To better define these systems, we performed matched quantitative genomic and proteomic analyses of mouse muscle cells as they performed mitochondrial biogenesis. We find that proteins involved in cellular iron homeostasis are highly coordinated with this process and that depletion of cellular iron results in a rapid, dose-dependent decrease of select mitochondrial protein levels and oxidative capacity. We further show that this process is universal across a broad range of cell types and fully reversed when iron is reintroduced. Collectively, our work reveals that cellular iron is a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, and provides quantitative data sets that can be leveraged to explore posttranscriptional and posttranslational processes that are essential for mitochondrial adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
Common genetic variations in Wnt signaling genes have been associated with metabolic syndrome and diabetes by mechanisms that are poorly understood. A rare nonconservative mutation in Wnt coreceptor LRP6 (LRP6R611C) has been shown to underlie autosomal dominant early onset coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. We examined the interplay between Wnt and insulin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle and skin fibroblasts of healthy nondiabetic LRP6R611C mutation carriers. LRP6 mutation carriers exhibited hyperinsulinemia and reduced insulin sensitivity compared to noncarrier relatives in response to oral glucose ingestion, which correlated with a significant decline in tissue expression of the insulin receptor and insulin signaling activity. Further investigations showed that the LRP6R611C mutation diminishes TCF7L2-dependent transcription of the IR while it increases the stability of IGFR and enhances mTORC1 activity. These findings identify the Wnt/LRP6/TCF7L2 axis as a regulator of glucose metabolism and a potential therapeutic target for insulin resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Diabetes is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Although atherosclerosis is initiated by deposition of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins in the artery wall, the entry of inflammatory leukocytes into lesions fuels disease progression and impairs resolution. We show that diabetic mice have increased numbers of circulating neutrophils and Ly6-Chi monocytes, reflecting hyperglycemia-induced proliferation and expansion of bone marrow myeloid progenitors and release of monocytes into the circulation. Increased neutrophil production of S100A8/S100A9, and its subsequent interaction with the receptor for advanced glycation end products on common myeloid progenitor cells, leads to enhanced myelopoiesis. Treatment of hyperglycemia reduces monocytosis, entry of monocytes into atherosclerotic lesions, and promotes regression. In patients with type 1 diabetes, plasma S100A8/S100A9 levels correlate with leukocyte counts and coronary artery disease. Thus, hyperglycemia drives myelopoiesis and promotes atherogenesis in diabetes.

Abstract: MicroRNA (miRNA) is a form of small noncoding RNA that regulates the expression of genes either by inhibiting mRNA translation or by inducing its degradation. Small microRNA play important roles in regulating a large number of cellular processes, including development, proliferation and apoptosis. This study examined the biological functions of miR-205 as a tumor suppressor in KB oral cancer cells. The results showed that miR-205 expression was significantly lower in KB oral cancer cells than in human normal oral keratinocytes. Furthermore, the miR-205 over-expressed in KB oral cancer cells increased the cell cytotoxicity and induced apoptosis through the activation of caspase-3/-7. The transfection of miR-205 into KB oral cancer cells strongly induced IL-24, a well known cytokine that acts as a tumor suppressor in a range of tumor tissues. In addition, miR-205 targeted the IL-24 promoter directly to induce gene expression. Overall, miR-205 has significant therapeutic potential to turn on silenced tumor suppressor genes by targeting them with miRNA.

Integrated genomic analyses revealed a miRNA-regulatory network that further defined a robust integrated mesenchymal subtype associated with poor overall survival in 459 cases of serous ovarian cancer (OvCa) from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 560 cases from independent cohorts. Eight key miRNAs, including miR-506, miR-141, and miR-200a, were predicted to regulate 89% of the targets in this network. Follow-up functional experiments illustrate that miR-506 augmented E-cadherin expression, inhibited cell migration and invasion, and prevented TGFβ-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting SNAI2, a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin. In human OvCa, miR-506 expression was correlated with decreased SNAI2 and VIM, elevated E-cadherin, and beneficial prognosis. Nanoparticle delivery of miR-506 in orthotopic OvCa mouse models led to E-cadherin induction and reduced tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
Osteoclast maturation and function primarily depend on receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-mediated induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), which is further activated via increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) oscillation. However, the coordination mechanism that mediates Ca2+ oscillation during osteoclastogenesis remains ill defined. Here, we identified transmembrane protein 64 (Tmem64) as a regulator of Ca2+ oscillation during osteoclastogenesis. We found that Tmem64-deficient mice exhibit increased bone mass due in part to impaired osteoclast formation. Using in vitro osteoclast culture systems, we show here that Tmem64 interacts with sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2 (SERCA2) and modulates its activity. Consequently, Tmem64 deficiency significantly diminishes RANKL-induced [Ca2+]i oscillation, which results in reduced Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) IV and mitochondrial ROS, both of which contribute to achieving the CREB activity necessary for osteoclast formation. These data demonstrate that Tmem64 is a positive modulator of osteoclast differentiation via SERCA2-dependent Ca2+ signaling.

Abstract: Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural polyphenol that is known as a powerful chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic anticancer molecule. This study focused on the effects of RSV on the activities and expression levels of antioxidant enzymes in the cancer cells. Prostate cancer PC-3 cells, hepatic cancer HepG2 cells, breast cancer MCF-7 cells and the non-cancerous HEK293T kidney epithelial cells were treated with a wide range of RSV concentrations (10-100 μΜ) for 24-72 h. Cell growth was estimated by trypan blue staining, activities of the antioxidant enzymes were measured spectrophotometrically, expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes were quantified by digitalizing the protein band intensities on Western blots, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry. Treatment with a low concentration of RSV (25 µM) significantly increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in PC-3, HepG2 and MCF-7 cells, but not in HEK293T cells. Catalase (CAT) activity was increased in HepG2 cells, but no effect was found on glutathione peroxidase (GPX) upon RSV treatment. RSV-induced SOD2 expression was observed in cancer cells, although the expression of SOD1, CAT and GPX1 was unaffected. Apoptosis increased upon RSV treatment of cancer cells, especially in PC-3 and HepG2 cells. Together, our data demonstrated that RSV inhibits cancer cell growth with minimal effects on non-cancerous cells. We postulate that the disproportional up-regulation of SOD, CAT and GPX expression and enzymatic activity in cancer cells results in the mitochondrial accumulation of H2O2, which in turn induces cancer cell apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) enhances cancer invasiveness and confers tumor cells with cancer stem cell (CSC)-like characteristics. We show that the Snail-G9a-Dnmt1 complex, which is critical for E-cadherin promoter silencing, is also required for the promoter methylation of fructose-1,6-biphosphatase (FBP1) in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). Loss of FBP1 induces glycolysis and results in increased glucose uptake, macromolecule biosynthesis, formation of tetrameric PKM2, and maintenance of ATP production under hypoxia. Loss of FBP1 also inhibits oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen species production by suppressing mitochondrial complex I activity; this metabolic reprogramming results in an increased CSC-like property and tumorigenicity by enhancing the interaction of β-catenin with T-cell factor. Our study indicates that the loss of FBP1 is a critical oncogenic event in EMT and BLBC.

Abstract: Summary
Damaged DNA is an obstacle during DNA replication and a cause of genome instability and cancer. To bypass this problem, eukaryotes activate DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways that involve ubiquitylation of the DNA polymerase clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Monoubiquitylation of PCNA mediates an error-prone pathway by recruiting translesion polymerases, whereas polyubiquitylation activates an error-free pathway that utilizes undamaged sister chromatids as templates. The error-free pathway involves recombination-related mechanisms; however, the factors that act along with polyubiquitylated PCNA remain largely unknown. Here we report that the PCNA-related 9-1-1 complex, which is typically linked to checkpoint signaling, participates together with Exo1 nuclease in error-free DDT. Notably, 9-1-1 promotes template switching in a manner that is distinct from its canonical checkpoint functions and uncoupled from the replication fork. Our findings thus reveal unexpected cooperation in the error-free pathway between the two related clamps and indicate that 9-1-1 plays a broader role in the DNA damage response than previously assumed.

Abstract: Summary
Proper control of hepatic glucose production is central to whole-body glucose homeostasis, and its disruption plays a major role in diabetes. Here, we demonstrate that although established as an intracellular lipid chaperone, aP2 is in fact actively secreted from adipocytes to control liver glucose metabolism. Secretion of aP2 from adipocytes is regulated by fasting- and lipolysis-related signals, and circulating aP2 levels are markedly elevated in mouse and human obesity. Recombinant aP2 stimulates glucose production and gluconeogenic activity in primary hepatocytes in vitro and in lean mice in vivo. In contrast, neutralization of secreted aP2 reduces glucose production and corrects the diabetic phenotype of obese mice. Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and pancreatic clamp studies upon aP2 administration or neutralization demonstrated actions of aP2 in liver. We conclude that aP2 is an adipokine linking adipocytes to hepatic glucose production and that neutralizing secreted aP2 may represent an effective therapeutic strategy against diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that enables catabolic and degradative pathways. These pathways commonly depend on vesicular transport controlled by Rabs, small GTPases inactivated by TBC/RabGAPs. The Rac1 effector TBC/RabGAP Armus (TBC1D2A) is known to inhibit Rab7, a key regulator of lysosomal function. However, the precise coordination of signaling and intracellular trafficking that regulates autophagy is poorly understood. We find that overexpression of Armus induces the accumulation of enlarged autophagosomes, while Armus depletion significantly delays autophagic flux. Upon starvation-induced autophagy, Rab7 is transiently activated. This spatiotemporal regulation of Rab7 guanosine triphosphate/guanosine diphosphate cycling occurs by Armus recruitment to autophagosomes via interaction with LC3, a core autophagy regulator. Interestingly, autophagy potently inactivates Rac1. Active Rac1 competes with LC3 for interaction with Armus and thus prevents its appropriate recruitment to autophagosomes. The precise coordination between Rac1 and Rab7 activities during starvation suggests that Armus integrates autophagy with signaling and endocytic trafficking.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid mobilization (lipolysis) in white adipose tissue (WAT) critically controls lipid turnover and adiposity in humans. While the acute regulation of lipolysis has been studied in detail, the transcriptional determinants of WAT lipolytic activity remain still largely unexplored. Here we show that the genetic inactivation of transcriptional cofactor transducin beta-like-related 1(TBLR1) blunts the lipolytic response of white adipocytes through the impairment of cAMP-dependent signal transduction. Indeed, mice lacking TBLR1 in adipocytes are defective in fasting-induced lipid mobilization and, when placed on a high-fat-diet, show aggravated adiposity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. TBLR1 levels are found to increase under lipolytic conditions in WAT of both human patients and mice, correlating with serum free fatty acids (FFAs). As a critical regulator of WAT cAMP signaling and lipid mobilization, proper activity of TBLR1 in adipocytes might thus represent a critical molecular checkpoint for the prevention of metabolic dysfunction in subjects with obesity-related disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Circulating trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels are strongly associated with atherosclerosis. We now examine genetic, dietary, and hormonal factors regulating TMAO levels. We demonstrate that two flavin mono-oxygenase family members, FMO1 and FMO3, oxidize trimethylamine (TMA), derived from gut flora metabolism of choline, to TMAO. Further, we show that FMO3 exhibits 10-fold higher specific activity than FMO1. FMO3 overexpression in mice significantly increases plasma TMAO levels while silencing FMO3 decreases TMAO levels. In both humans and mice, hepatic FMO3 expression is reduced in males compared to females. In mice, this reduction in FMO3 expression is due primarily to downregulation by androgens. FMO3 expression is induced by dietary bile acids by a mechanism that involves the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a bile acid-activated nuclear receptor. Analysis of natural genetic variation among inbred strains of mice indicates that FMO3 and TMAO are significantly correlated, and TMAO levels explain 11% of the variation in atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
While all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has been the paradigm of targeted therapy for oncogenic transcription factors, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, and a significant number of patients still relapse and become ATRA resistant. We identified the histone demethylase PHF8 as a coactivator that is specifically recruited by RARα fusions to activate expression of their downstream targets upon ATRA treatment. Forced expression of PHF8 resensitizes ATRA-resistant APL cells, whereas its downregulation confers resistance. ATRA sensitivity depends on the enzymatic activity and phosphorylation status of PHF8, which can be pharmacologically manipulated to resurrect ATRA sensitivity to resistant cells. These findings provide important molecular insights into ATRA response and a promising avenue for overcoming ATRA resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Global repression of protein synthesis is a hallmark of the cellular stress response and has been attributed primarily to inhibition of translation initiation, although this mechanism may not always explain the full extent of repression. Here, using ribosome footprinting, we show that 2 hr of severe heat stress triggers global pausing of translation elongation at around codon 65 on most mRNAs in both mouse and human cells. The genome-wide nature of the phenomenon, its location, and features of protein N termini suggested the involvement of ribosome-associated chaperones. After severe heat shock, Hsp70’s interactions with the translational machinery were markedly altered and its association with ribosomes was reduced. Pretreatment with mild heat stress or overexpression of Hsp70 protected cells from heat shock-induced elongation pausing, while inhibition of Hsp70 activity triggered elongation pausing without heat stress. Our findings suggest that regulation of translation elongation in general, and by chaperones in particular, represents a major component of cellular stress responses.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways is crucial for the maintenance of genome stability; however, remarkably little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which phosphorylation controls DSB repair. Here, we show that PIN1, a phosphorylation-specific prolyl isomerase, interacts with key DSB repair factors and affects the relative contributions of homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) to DSB repair. We find that PIN1-deficient cells display reduced NHEJ due to increased DNA end resection, whereas resection and HR are compromised in PIN1-overexpressing cells. Moreover, we identify CtIP as a substrate of PIN1 and show that DSBs become hyperresected in cells expressing a CtIP mutant refractory to PIN1 recognition. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that PIN1 impinges on CtIP stability by promoting its ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Collectively, these data uncover PIN1-mediated isomerization as a regulatory mechanism coordinating DSB repair.

Abstract: Summary
The Cul4-Cdt2 (CRL4Cdt2) E3 ubiquitin ligase is a master regulator of cell-cycle progression and genome stability. Despite its central role in the degradation of many cell-cycle regulators, e.g., Cdt1, p21, and Pr-Set7/Set8, little is known about the regulation of its activity. We report that Cdt2 is autoubiquitylated by the CRL4A E3 ubiquitin ligase. Cdt2 is additionally polyubiquitylated and degraded by Cul1-FBXO11 (CRL1FBXO11). CRL1FBXO11-mediated degradation of Cdt2 stabilizes p21 and Set8, and this is important during the response to TGF-β, with the Set8 induction being important for turning off the activation of Smad2. The migration of epithelial cells is also stimulated by CRL1FBXO11-mediated downregulation of Cdt2 and the consequent stabilization of Set8. This is an interesting example of crossregulation between specific Cullin 4 and Cullin 1 E3 ubiquitin ligases and highlights the role of ubiquitylation in regulating cellular responses to TGF-β and the migration of epithelial cells.

Abstract: We performed activation tagging screen to isolate abscisic acid (ABA) response mutants. One of the mutants, designated ahs10 (ABA-hypersensitive10), exhibited ABA-hypersensitive phe- notypes. TAIL-PCR analysis of the mutant revealed that T-DNA was inserted in the promoter region of the Arabidopsis gene, At2g01430, which encodes a homeodomain-leucine zipper protein ATHB17. Subsequent expression analysis indicated that ATHB17 was activated in ahs10. To recapitulate the mutant phenotypes, we prepared ATHB17 OX lines and investigated their phenotypes. The results showed that ATHB17 confers ABA-hypersensitivity and drought tolerance. On the contrary, ATHB17 knockout lines were ABA-insensitive and drought-sensitive, further demonstrating that ATHB17 is involved in ABA and water-stress responses. Interestingly, the ATHB17 effect on seedling growth in the presence of ABA was observed only during the postgermination seedling establishment stage, suggesting that it functions during a narrow developmental window of early seedling growth.

Abstract: Dynamic dimer formation is an elaborate means of modulating transcription factor activities in diverse cellular processes. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED 1 (HFR1), for example, plays a role in plant photomorphogenesis by forming non-DNA binding heterodimers with PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs). Recent studies have shown that a small HLH protein KIDARI (KDR) negatively regulates the HFR1 activity in the process. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the KDR control of the HFR1 activity are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that KDR attenuates the HFR1 activity by competitively forming nonfunctional heterodimers, causing liberation of PIF4 from the transcriptionally inactive HFR1-PIF4 complex. Accordingly, the photomorphogenic hypocotyl growth of the HFR1-overexpres-sing plants can be suppressed by KDR coexpression, as observed in the HFR1-deficient hfr1-201 mutant. These results indicate that the PIF4 activity is modulated through a double layer of competitive inhibition by HFR1 and KDR, which could in turn ensure fine-tuning of the PIF4 activity under fluctuating light conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Removal of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the bloodstream via reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is a process of major biological importance. Here we demonstrate that lymphatic drainage is required for RCT. We have previously shown that hypercholesterolemia in mice is associated with impaired lymphatic drainage and increased lipid accumulation in peripheral tissues. We now show that restoration of lymphatic drainage in these mice significantly improves cholesterol clearance. Conversely, obstruction of lymphatic vessels in wild-type mice significantly impairs RCT. Finally, we demonstrate using silencing RNA interference, neutralizing antibody, and transgenic mice that removal of cholesterol by lymphatic vessels is dependent on the uptake and transcytosis of HDL by scavenger receptor class B type I expressed on lymphatic endothelium. Collectively, this study challenges the current view that lymphatic endothelium is a passive exchange barrier for cholesterol transport and provides further evidence for its interplay with lipid biology in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Neurotrophins control the development and adult plasticity of the vertebrate nervous system. Failure to identify invertebrate neurotrophin orthologs, however, has precluded studies in invertebrate models, limiting our understanding of fundamental aspects of neurotrophin biology and function. We identified a neurotrophin (ApNT) and Trk receptor (ApTrk) in the mollusk Aplysia and found that they play a central role in learning-related synaptic plasticity. Blocking ApTrk signaling impairs long-term facilitation, whereas augmenting ApNT expression enhances it and induces the growth of new synaptic varicosities at the monosynaptic connection between sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex. Unlike vertebrate neurotrophins, ApNT has multiple coding exons and exerts distinct synaptic effects through differentially processed and secreted splice isoforms. Our findings demonstrate the existence of bona fide neurotrophin signaling in invertebrates and reveal a posttranscriptional mechanism that regulates neurotrophin processing and the release of proneurotrophins and mature neurotrophins that differentially modulate synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
Human mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is a high-mobility group (HMG) protein at the nexus of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, transcription, and inheritance. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying its posttranslational regulation. Here, we demonstrate that TFAM is phosphorylated within its HMG box 1 (HMG1) by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in mitochondria. HMG1 phosphorylation impairs the ability of TFAM to bind DNA and to activate transcription. We show that only DNA-free TFAM is degraded by the Lon protease, which is inhibited by the anticancer drug bortezomib. In cells with normal mtDNA levels, HMG1-phosphorylated TFAM is degraded by Lon. However, in cells with severe mtDNA deficits, nonphosphorylated TFAM is also degraded, as it is DNA free. Depleting Lon in these cells increases levels of TFAM and upregulates mtDNA content, albeit transiently. Phosphorylation and proteolysis thus provide mechanisms for rapid fine-tuning of TFAM function and abundance in mitochondria, which are crucial for maintaining and expressing mtDNA.

Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) promotes chromosomal translocations by inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and oncogenes in the G1 phase. RPA is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein that associates with resected DSBs in the S phase and facilitates the assembly of factors involved in homologous repair (HR), such as Rad51. Notably, RPA deposition also marks sites of AID-mediated damage, but its role in Ig gene recombination remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that RPA associates asymmetrically with resected ssDNA in response to lesions created by AID, recombination-activating genes (RAG), or other nucleases. Small amounts of RPA are deposited at AID targets in G1 in an ATM-dependent manner. In contrast, recruitment in the S–G2/M phase is extensive, ATM independent, and associated with Rad51 accumulation. In the S–G2/M phase, RPA increases in nonhomologous-end-joining-deficient lymphocytes, where there is more extensive DNA-end resection. Thus, most RPA recruitment during class switch recombination represents salvage of unrepaired breaks by homology-based pathways during the S–G2/M phase of the cell cycle.

Abstract: Previous studies have identified two zebrafish mutants, cloche and groom of cloche, which lack the majority of the endothelial lineage at early developmental stages. However, at later stages, these avascular mutant embryos generate rudimentary vessels, indicating that they retain the ability to generate endothelial cells despite this initial lack of endothelial progenitors. To further investigate molecular mechanisms that allow the emergence of the endothelial lineage in these avascular mutant embryos, we analyzed the gene expression profile using microarray analysis on isolated endothelial cells. We find that the expression of the genes characteristic of the mesodermal lineages are substantially elevated in the kdrl+ cells isolated from avascular mutant embryos. Subsequent validation and analyses of the microarray data identifies Sox11b, a zebrafish ortholog of SRY-related HMG box 11 (SOX11), which have not previously implicated in vascular development. We further define the function sox11b during vascular development, and find that sox11b function is essential for developmental angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos, specifically regulating sprouting angiogenesis. Taken together, our analyses illustrate a complex regulation of endothelial specification and differentiation during vertebrate development.

Abstract: Summary
The PIWI/PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) machinery has been well documented to maintain genome integrity by silencing transposons in animal germ cells. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the biogenesis and function of this machinery; however, its metabolism has remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that murine PIWI (MIWI) is degraded through the APC/C-26S proteasome pathway and that piRNAs play an indispensable role in this process by enhancing MIWI interaction with an APC/C substrate-binding subunit. Interestingly, piRNA-triggered MIWI destruction occurs in late spermatids, which in turn leads to piRNA elimination, suggesting a feedforward mechanism for coordinated removal of the MIWI/piRNA machinery at a specific developmental stage. Importantly, the proper removal of MIWI/piRNA is essential for sperm maturation. Together, our results reveal a role for piRNAs in regulating the clearance of the MIWI/piRNA machinery via the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway and demonstrate the critical importance of proper temporal regulation of MIWI/piRNA in male germ cell development.

Abstract: Summary
We report a paracrine effect whereby endothelial cells (ECs) promote the cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. We showed that, without direct cell-cell contact, ECs secrete factors that promoted the CSC phenotype in CRC cells via Notch activation. In human CRC specimens, CD133 and Notch intracellular domain-positive CRC cells colocalized in perivascular regions. An EC-derived, soluble form of Jagged-1, via ADAM17 proteolytic activity, led to Notch activation in CRC cells in a paracrine manner; these effects were blocked by immunodepletion of Jagged-1 in EC-conditioned medium or blockade of ADAM17 activity. Collectively, ECs play an active role in promoting Notch signaling and the CSC phenotype by secreting soluble Jagged-1.

Abstract: The negatively regulating zinc finger protein (NZFP) is an essential transcription repressor required for early development during gastrulation in Xenopus laevis. In this study, we found that NZFP interacts with the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation E2 enzyme, Ubc9, and contains three putative SUMO conjugation sites. Studies with NZFP mutants containing mutations at the putative SUMO conjugation sites showed that these sites were able to be modified independently with SUMO. NZFP was found to be localized in the same nuclear bodies with SUMO-1. However, sumoylation of NZFP did not play a role either in the translocation of NZFP into the nucleus or on nuclear body formation. While wild type NZFP showed significant transcriptional repression, SUMO-conjugation site mutants manifested a decrease in transcriptional repression activity which is reversely proportional to the amount of sumoylation. The sumoylation defective mutant lost its TBP binding activity, while wild type NZFP interacted with TBP and inhibited transcription complex formation. These results strongly suggest that the sumoylation of NZFP facilitates NZFP to bind to TBP and the NZFP/TBP complex then represses the transcription of the target gene by inhibiting basal transcription complex formation.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation is initiated by an E1 enzyme that catalyzes carboxy-terminal Ub adenylation, thioester bond formation to a catalytic cysteine in the E1 Cys domain, and thioester transfer to a catalytic cysteine in E2 conjugating enzymes. How the E1 and E2 active sites come together during thioester transfer and how Ub E1 interacts with diverse Ub E2s remains unclear. Here we present a crystal structure of a Ub E1-E2(Ubc4)/Ub/ATP⋅Mg complex that was stabilized by induction of a disulfide bond between the E1 and E2 active sites. The structure reveals combinatorial recognition of the E2 by the E1 ubiquitin-fold domain (UFD) and Cys domain and mutational analysis, coupled with thioester transfer assays with E1, Ubc4, and other Ub E2s, show that both interfaces are important for thioester transfer. Comparison to a Ub E1/Ub/ATP⋅Mg structure reveals conformational changes in the E1 that bring the E1 and E2 active sites together.

Abstract: Glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role in cellular defense against unregulated oxidative stress in mammalian cells including neurons. We previously demonstrated that GSH decrease using [D,L]-buthionine sulphoximine (BSO) induces retinal cell death, but the underlying mechanisms of this are still unclear. Here, we demonstrated that retinal GSH level is closely related to retinal cell death as well as expression of an anti-apoptotic molecule, Bcl-2, in the retina. We induced differential expression of retinal GSH by single and multiple administrations of BSO, and examined retinal GSH levels and retinal cell death in vivo. Single BSO administration showed a transient decrease in the retinal GSH level, whereas multiple BSO administration showed a persistent decrease in the retinal GSH level. Retinal cell death also showed similar patterns: transient increase of retinal cell death was observed after single BSO administration, whereas persistent increase of retinal cell death was observed after multiple BSO administration. Changes in the retinal GSH level affected Bcl-2 expression in the retina. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses showed that single and multiple administration of BSO induced differential expressions of Bcl-2 in the retina. Taken together, the results of our study suggest that the retinal GSH is important for the survival of retinal cells, and retinal GSH appears to be deeply related to Bcl-2 expression in the retina. Thus, alteration of Bcl-2 expression may provide a therapeutic tool for retinal degenerative diseases caused by retinal oxidative stress such as glaucoma or retinopath.

Abstract: Summary
Past studies have documented a crosstalk between H2B ubiquitylation (H2Bub) and H3K4 methylation, but little (if any) direct evidence exists explaining the mechanism underlying H2Bub-dependent H3K4 methylation on chromatin templates. Here, we took advantage of an in vitro histone methyltransferase assay employing a reconstituted yeast Set1 complex (ySet1C) and a recombinant chromatin template containing fully ubiquitylated H2B to gain valuable insights. Combined with genetic analyses, we demonstrate that the n-SET domain within Set1, but not Swd2, is essential for H2Bub-dependent H3K4 methylation. Spp1, a homolog of human CFP1, is conditionally involved in this crosstalk. Our findings extend to the human Set1 complex, underscoring the conserved nature of this disease-relevant crosstalk pathway. As not all members of the H3K4 methyltransferase family contain n-SET domains, our studies draw attention to the n-SET domain as a predictor of an H2B ubiquitylation-sensing mechanism that leads to downstream H3K4 methylation.

Abstract: Summary
Although the sebaceous gland (SG) plays an important role in skin function, the mechanisms regulating SG differentiation and carcinoma formation are poorly understood. We previously reported that c-MYC overexpression stimulates SG differentiation. We now demonstrate roles for the androgen receptor (AR) and p53. MYC-induced SG differentiation was reduced in mice lacking a functional AR. High levels of MYC triggered a p53-dependent DNA damage response, leading to accumulation of proliferative SG progenitors and inhibition of AR signaling. Conversely, testosterone treatment or p53 deletion activated AR signaling and restored MYC-induced differentiation. Poorly differentiated human sebaceous carcinomas exhibited high p53 and low AR expression. Thus, the consequences of overactivating MYC in the SG depend on whether AR or p53 is activated, as they form a regulatory axis controlling proliferation and differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) is an epigenetic reader and transcriptional regulator recently identified as a cancer therapeutic target for acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Burkitt’s lymphoma. Although chromatin targeting is a crucial function of Brd4, there is little understanding of how bromodomains that bind acetylated histones are regulated, nor how the gene-specific activity of Brd4 is determined. Via interaction screen and domain mapping, we identified p53 as a functional partner of Brd4. Interestingly, Brd4 association with p53 is modulated by casein kinase II (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved acidic region in Brd4 that selectively contacts either a juxtaposed bromodomain or an adjacent basic region to dictate the ability of Brd4 binding to chromatin and also the recruitment of p53 to regulated promoters. The unmasking of bromodomains and activator recruitment, concurrently triggered by the CK2 phospho switch, provide an intriguing mechanism for gene-specific targeting by a universal epigenetic reader.

Abstract: Summary
V(D)J recombination is essential for generating a diverse array of B and T cell receptors that can recognize and combat foreign antigens. As with any recombination event, tight control is essential to prevent the occurrence of genetic anomalies that drive cellular transformation. One important aspect of regulation is directed targeting of the RAG recombinase. Indeed, RAG accumulates at the 3′ end of individual antigen receptor loci poised for rearrangement; however, it is not known whether focal binding is involved in regulating cleavage, and what mechanisms lead to enrichment of RAG in this region. Here, we show that monoallelic looping out of the 3′ end of the T cell receptor α (Tcra) locus, coupled with transcription and increased chromatin/nuclear accessibility, is linked to focal RAG binding and ATM-mediated regulation of monoallelic cleavage on looped-out 3′ regions. Our data identify higher-order loop formation as a key determinant of directed RAG targeting and the maintenance of genome stability.

Abstract: The THO complex (THO) is an evolutionary conserved protein required for the formation of export-competent mRNP. The growing evidence indicates that the metazoan THO plays important roles in cell differentiation and cellular stress response. But the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Herein we examined the relevance of THO to cellular signaling pathways involved in cell differentiation and cellular stress response. When we examined the endogenous p53 level in the testis, it was sustained much longer during spermatogenesis in the THO mutant compared to that of wild-type. In flies with impaired THO, overexpression of p53 by eye-specific GAL4 not only enhanced p53-mediated retinal degeneration, but p53 level was also elevated compared to the control flies. Since the body size of the THO mutant flies was significantly larger than control flies, we also examined whether the PI3K/AKT signaling is enhanced in the mutant flies. The results showed that the endogenous level of phosphorylated AKT, which is the active form, was highly elevated in the THO mutants. Taken together our results suggested that both p53 and PI3K/AKT signalings are up-regulated in the flies with impaired THO.

Abstract: Antigen-mediated mast cell (MC) degranulation is the critical early event in the induction of allergic reactions. Transient receptor potential channels (TRPC), particularly TRPC1, are thought to contribute to such MC activation. To explore the contribution of TRPC1 in MC-driven allergic reactions, we examined antigen-mediated anaphylaxis in Trpc1−/− and WT mice, and TRPC1 involvement in the activation of MCs derived from the bone marrow (BMMCs) of these mice. In vivo, we observed a similar induction of passive systemic anaphylaxis in the Trpc1−/− mice compared to WT controls. Nevertheless, there was delayed recovery from this response in Trpc1−/− mice. Furthermore, contrary to expectations, Trpc1−/− BMMCs responded to antigen with enhanced calcium signaling but with little defect in degranulation or associated signaling. In contrast, antigen-mediated production of TNF-α, and other cytokines, was enhanced in the Trpc1−/− BMMCs, as were calcium-dependent events required for these responses. Additionally, circulating levels of TNF-α in response to antigen were preferentially elevated in the Trpc1−/− mice, and administration of an anti-TNF-α antibody blocked the delay in recovery from anaphylaxis in these mice. These data thus provide evidence that, in this model, TRPC1 promotes recovery from the anaphylactic response by repressing antigen-mediated TNF-α release from MCs.

Abstract: Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channels composed of Stim and Orai proteins play a critical role in diverse biological processes. Upon endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated calcium (Ca2+) depletion, Stim proteins oligomerize with Orai to initiate Ca2+influx across the plasma membrane. The ubiquitin-like (UBL) and ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains of ubiquilin 1 are involved in the degradation of presenilin and polyglutamine proteins. Through screening of Orai1 interaction partner(s) that might have an effect on SOCE, ubiquilin 1 was identified as a target of Orai1. However, the UBL and UBA domains of ubiquilin 1 were dispensable for this interaction. Additionally, ubiquilin 1 and Orai1 colocalized in the cytosolic compartment. Ubiquilin 1 increased the ubiquitination of Orai1, resulting in the formation of a high-molecular-weight form. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, failed to block the degradation of Orai1, whereas bafilomycin A, a lysosome inhibitor, prevented Orai1 degradation. Confocal microscopy studies demonstrated that a fraction of Orai1 colocalized with ubiquilin 1 and the autophagosomal marker LC3. Because Orai1 is a constituent of SOCE, we determined the effect of ubiquilin 1 on Orai1-mediated Ca2+influx. As we expected, intracellular Ca2+mobilization, a process normally potentiated by Orai1, was downregulated by ubiquilin 1. Taken together, these findings suggest that ubiquilin 1 downregulates intracellular Ca2+mobilization and its down-stream signaling by promoting the ubiquitination and ly-sosomal degradation of Orai1.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) regulates pluripotency, differentiation, and tumorigenesis through catalysis of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) on chromatin. However, the mechanisms that underlie PRC2 recruitment and spreading on chromatin remain unclear. Here we report that histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) binding activity is harbored in the Tudor motifs of PRC2-associated polycomb-like (PCL) proteins PHF1/PCL1 and PHF19/PCL3. Ectopically expressed PHF1 induced Tudor-dependent stabilization of PRC2 complexes on bulk chromatin and mediated spreading of PRC2 and H3K27me3 into H3K36me3-containing chromatin regions. In murine pluripotent stem cells, we identified coexistence of H3K36me3, H3K27me3, and PHF19/PCL3 at a subset of poised developmental genes and demonstrated that PHF19/PCL3 Tudor function is required for optimal H3K27me3 and repression of these loci. Collectively, our data suggest that PCL recognition of H3K36me3 promotes intrusion of PRC2 complexes into active chromatin regions to promote gene silencing and modulate the chromatin landscape during development.

Abstract: The histology and ultrastructure of the female accessory glands in the scorpionfly Panorpa sexspinosa Cheng was studied using light and transmission electron microscopy. The glands consist of a pair of distal elongate gland tubes and a basal common duct, which opens in the genital cavity at the dorsal side of the genital plate. The whole gland tubes and common duct are similar histologically and ultrastructurally. The epithelium of female accessory glands consists of two cell types: the outer secretory cells and the inner duct-forming cells. These two cells that join with a cuticular duct connecting to the inner intima constitute a functional glandular unit belonging to Class 3 glandular cells of epidermal glands. The secretory cells are rich in organelles, such as mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex, indicating that they are active in secretion. The duct-forming cells are flattened with sparse-distributed organelles. These two kinds of cells are connected by septate junctions. The cuticular duct consists of a receiving and a conducting canal and is responsible for transferring the secretions of the secretory cell to the lumen. The receiving canal is formed of interrupted multilayered inner epicuticle and located in the irregular extracellular cavity of the secretory cell, bounded by microvilli. The conducting canal connects the inner intima and opens into the central lumen. The tentative functions of the secretions are briefly discussed.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular mechanisms underpinning nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are not well understood. The earliest step of NAFLD is hepatic steatosis, which is one of the main characteristics of aging liver. Here, we present a molecular scenario of age-related liver steatosis. We show that C/EBPα-S193D knockin mice have age-associated epigenetic changes and develop hepatic steatosis at 2 months of age. The underlying mechanism of the hepatic steatosis in old wild-type (WT) mice and in young S193D mice includes increased amounts of tripartite p300-C/EBPα/β complexes that activate promoters of five genes that drive triglyceride synthesis. Knockdown of p300 in old WT mice inhibits hepatic steatosis. Indeed, transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative p300 have fewer C/EBPα/β-p300 complexes and do not develop age-dependent hepatic steatosis. Notably, the p300-C/EBPα/β pathway is activated in the livers of patients with NAFLD. Thus, our results show that p300 and C/EBP proteins are essential participants in hepatic steatosis.

Abstract: Summary
How adherens junctions (AJs) are formed upon cell division is largely unexplored. Here, we found that AJ formation is coordinated with cytokinesis and relies on an interplay between the dividing cell and its neighbors. During contraction of the cytokinetic ring, the neighboring cells locally accumulate Myosin II and produce the cortical tension necessary to set the initial geometry of the daughter cell interface. However, the neighboring cell membranes impede AJ formation. Upon midbody formation and concomitantly to neighboring cell withdrawal, Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization oriented by the midbody maintains AJ geometry and regulates AJ final length and the epithelial cell arrangement upon division. We propose that cytokinesis in epithelia is a multicellular process, whereby the cooperative actions of the dividing cell and its neighbors define a two-tiered mechanism that spatially and temporally controls AJ formation while maintaining tissue cohesiveness.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage elicits a cellular signaling response that initiates cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. Here, we find that DNA damage triggers a critical block in glutamine metabolism, which is required for proper DNA damage responses. This block requires the mitochondrial SIRT4, which is induced by numerous genotoxic agents and represses the metabolism of glutamine into tricarboxylic acid cycle. SIRT4 loss leads to both increased glutamine-dependent proliferation and stress-induced genomic instability, resulting in tumorigenic phenotypes. Moreover, SIRT4 knockout mice spontaneously develop lung tumors. Our data uncover SIRT4 as an important component of the DNA damage response pathway that orchestrates a metabolic block in glutamine metabolism, cell cycle arrest, and tumor suppression.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that govern the maintenance and differentiation of tissue-specific progenitors in development and tissue regeneration are poorly understood. We show that development of Sox2+ progenitors in the lung endoderm is regulated by histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (Hdac1/2). Hdac1/2 deficiency leads to a loss of Sox2 expression and a block in proximal airway development. This is mediated in part by derepression of Bmp4 and the tumor suppressor Rb1, which are direct transcriptional targets of Hdac1/2. In contrast to development, postnatal loss of Hdac1/2 in airway epithelium does not affect the expression of Sox2 or Bmp4. However, postnatal loss of Hdac1/2 leads to increased expression of the cell-cycle regulators Rb1, p21/Cdkn1a, and p16/Ink4a, resulting in a loss of cell-cycle progression and defective regeneration of Sox2+ lung epithelium. Thus, Hdac1/2 have both common and unique targets that differentially regulate tissue-specific progenitor activity during development and regeneration.

Abstract: This study describes the organization of mature hyaline xiphoid cartilage during repair in animals submitted to electrical current stimulation. Twenty male Wistar rats, 90 days old, were divided into a control group (CG) and a treated group (TG). A cylindrical full-thickness cartilage defects were created with a 3-mm punch in anesthetized animals. After 24h, TG received daily applications of a continuous electrical current (1Hz/20μA) for 5min. The animals were sacrificed after 7, 21 and 35 days for structural analysis. In CG, the repair tissue presented fibrous characteristics, with fibroblastic cells being infiltrated and permeated by blood vessels. Basophilic foci of cartilage tissue were observed on day 35. In TG, the repair tissue also presented fibrous characteristics, but a larger number of thick collagen fibers were seen on day 21. A large number of cartilaginous nests were observed on day 35. Cell numbers were significantly higher in TG. Calcification points were detected in TG on day 35. There was no difference in elastic fibers between groups. Ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of chondrocyte-like cells in CG at all time points, but only on days 21 and 35 in TG. The amount of cuprolinic blue-stained proteoglycans was higher in TG on day 35. Microcurrent stimulation accelerates the repair process in non-articular hyaline cartilage.

Abstract: A previous study showed that the EphA7 receptor regulates apoptotic cell death during early brain development. In this study, we provide evidence that the EphA7 receptor interacts with death receptors such as tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) to decrease cell viability. We showed that ephrinA5 stimulates EphA7 to activate the TNFR1-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway. In addition, a pull-down assay using biotinylated ephrinA5-Fc revealed that ephrinA5-EphA7 complexes recruit TNFR1 to form a multi-protein complex. Immunocytochemical staining analysis showed that EphA7 was co-localized with TNFR1 on the cell surface when cells were incubated with ephrinA5 at low temperatures. Finally, both the internalization motif and death domain of TNFR1 was important for interacting with an intracytoplasmic region of EphA7; this interaction was essential for inducing the apoptotic signaling cascade. This result suggests that a distinct multi-protein complex comprising ephrinA5, EphA7, and TNFR1 may constitute a platform for inducing caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Mitophagy has been recently described as a mechanism of elimination of damaged organelles. Although the regulation of the amount of mitochondria is a core issue concerning cellular energy homeostasis, the relationship between mitochondrial degradation and energetic activity has not yet been considered. Here, we report that the stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation enhances mitochondrial renewal by increasing its degradation rate. Upon high oxidative phosphorylation activity, we found that the small GTPase Rheb is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane. This mitochondrial localization of Rheb promotes mitophagy through a physical interaction with the mitochondrial autophagic receptor Nix and the autophagosomal protein LC3-II. Thus, Rheb-dependent mitophagy contributes to the maintenance of optimal mitochondrial energy production. Our data suggest that mitochondrial degradation contributes to a bulk renewal of the organelle in order to prevent mitochondrial aging and to maintain the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) activate a DNA damage response (DDR) that coordinates checkpoint pathways with DNA repair. ATM and ATR kinases are activated sequentially. Homology-directed repair (HDR) is initiated by resection of DSBs to generate 3′ single-stranded DNA overhangs. How resection and HDR are activated during DDR is not known, nor are the roles of ATM and ATR in HDR. Here, we show that CtIP undergoes ATR-dependent hyperphosphorylation in response to DSBs. ATR phosphorylates an invariant threonine, T818 of Xenopus CtIP (T859 in human). Nonphosphorylatable CtIP (T818A) does not bind to chromatin or initiate resection. Our data support a model in which ATM activity is required for an early step in resection, leading to ATR activation, CtIP-T818 phosphorylation, and accumulation of CtIP on chromatin. Chromatin binding by modified CtIP precedes extensive resection and full checkpoint activation.

Abstract: Summary
Basement membranes (BMs) are specialized extracellular matrices that are essential for epithelial structure and morphogenesis. However, little is known about how BM proteins are delivered to the basal cell surface or how this process is regulated during development. Here, we identify a mechanism for polarized BM secretion in the Drosophila follicle cells. BM proteins are synthesized in a basal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment from localized mRNAs and are then exported through Tango1-positive ER exit sites to basal Golgi clusters. Next, Crag targets Rab10 to structures in the basal cytoplasm, where it restricts protein delivery to the basal surface. These events occur during egg chamber elongation, a morphogenetic process that depends on follicle cell planar polarity and BM remodeling. Significantly, Tango1 and Rab10 are also planar polarized at the basal epithelial surface. We propose that the spatial control of BM production along two tissue axes promotes exocytic efficiency, BM remodeling, and organ morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Adult humans have about 25 trillion red blood cells (RBCs), and each second we recycle about 5 million RBCs by erythrophagocytosis (EP) in macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system. Despite the central role for EP in mammalian iron metabolism, the molecules and pathways responsible for heme trafficking during EP remain unknown. Here, we show that the mammalian homolog of HRG1, a transmembrane heme permease in C. elegans, is essential for macrophage iron homeostasis and transports heme from the phagolysosome to the cytoplasm during EP. HRG1 is strongly expressed in macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system and specifically localizes to the phagolysosomal membranes during EP. Depletion of Hrg1 in mouse macrophages causes attenuation of heme transport from the phagolysosomal compartment. Importantly, missense polymorphisms in human HRG1 are defective in heme transport. Our results reveal HRG1 as the long-sought heme transporter for heme-iron recycling in macrophages and suggest that genetic variations in HRG1 could be modifiers of human iron metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV Nef protein recruits the polycomb protein Eed and mimics an integrin receptor signal for reasons that are not entirely clear. Here we demonstrate that Nef and Eed complex with the integrin effector paxillin to recruit and activate TNFα converting enzyme (TACE alias ADAM 17) and its close relative ADAM10. The activated proteases cleaved proTNFα and were shuttled into extracellular vesicles (EVs). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells that ingested these EVs released TNFα. Analyzing the mechanism, we found that Pak2, an established host cell effector of Nef, phosphorylated paxillin on Ser272/274 to induce TACE-paxillin association and shuttling into EVs via lipid rafts. Conversely, Pak1 phosphorylated paxillin on Ser258, which inhibited TACE association and lipid raft transfer. Interestingly, melanoma cells used an identical mechanism to shuttle predominantly ADAM10 into EVs. We conclude that HIV-1 and cancer cells exploit a paxillin/integrin-controlled mechanism to release TACE/ADAM10-containing vesicles, ensuring better proliferation/growth conditions in their microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial and temporal control of actin filament barbed end elongation is crucial for force generation by actin networks. In this study, genetics, cell biology, and biochemistry were used to reveal three complementary mechanisms that regulate actin filament barbed end elongation in Arp2/3-derived networks. Aip1 inhibits elongation of aged ADP-actin filaments decorated with cofilin and, together with capping protein (CP), maintains a high level of assembly-competent actin species. We identified Abp1 and Aim3 as two additional proteins that work together to inhibit barbed end elongation. Abp1/Aim3 collaborates with CP to control elongation of newly assembled ATP-actin filaments to organize filament polarity within actin networks. Thus, three distinct mechanisms control filament elongation in different regions of Arp2/3 networks, maintaining pools of assembly-competent actin species while ensuring proper filament polarity and facilitating force production.
