Abstract: Potassium carbonate has recently been identified as a promising candidate for thermochemical energy storage. However, as for many salt hydrates, its reaction kinetics is relatively slow. K2CO3 has a metastable zone, where the reaction is kinetically hindered, which limits the temperature operating window. This work aims to improve the material performance, focusing on two aspects; improving the kinetics outside the metastable zone and reducing the metastable zone width. This work shows that doping with Cs2CO3, can improve both. Moreover, it is shown that the dopant enhances the hydration rate by introducing mobility due to local deliquescence. This lays the foundation for further material research using dopants to enhance the performance of salt hydrates.

Abstract: Considering the fast pace of the development of the Photovoltaic (PV) market and the installations in last two decades and also the increasing scarcity of resources for semiconductor materials, recycling waste PV modules including thin film is very important. Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are extensively used as front contact electrodes in thin-film photovoltaic devices. The paper presents, the new strategies developed to extract TCO coated glass from thin film amorphous silicon PV end-of-life modules. The recycling of thin film PV modules is based on a very simple approach that includes chemical, thermal and mechanical treatments. Optimised solutions of 1 M NaOH and 1 M KOH were used to extract TCO coated glass. The feasibility of the processing steps was demonstrated on laboratory scale size module and the etching rate for P, I, and N-layers of amorphous silicon is also studied. The extracted TCO was identified as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) using X-ray diffraction and UV–visible spectroscopy techniques. The laser scribed FTO glass was successfully extracted without damaging the properties of the material. The extracted FTO has very low resistivity and sheet resistance in the range of 10−4 Ω-cm and 11.74 Ω/sq. respectively, has uniform transmission throughout the measured film surface of 2 cm2 in the visible region having bandgap ∼3.8eV. The recycling cost and current market value of the recycled FTO are also estimated for all the installed capacities of amorphous silicon. Considering the TCO properties, extracted FTO has the potential for its reuse in the fabrication of new thin film PV modules and other optoelectronic device applications as well.

Abstract: Background
Gefitinib is the first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR sensitive mutation. However, acquired resistance significantly limits its therapeutic efficacy. CircSETD3 has been reported to promote gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells, however, its underlying mechanisms have not been fully clarified.
Methods
The expression of circSETD3 were detected in NSCLC patients who received gefitinib as first-line treatment, including 20 gefitinib-sensitive patients and 20 acquired gefitinib-resistant patients. Cell viability were examined by CCK8 assay. The mRNA and protein levels were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. Using RNA pull-down assay followed by mass spectrometry to identified proteins that interact with circSETD3. The interaction between circSETD3 and fragile X-related protein-1 (FXR1) were further validated by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and pull-down analysis. Fuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence (IF) assays was used for the identification of sub-location of circSETD3 and FXR1 in cells. The effect of circSETD3 overexpression and knockdown on NSCLC tumor growth to gefitinib sensitivity was detected using the mouse xenograft model.
Results
CircSETD3 was significantly upregulated in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells, and decreased the gefitinib sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, circSETD3 facilitated FXR1 binding to its downstream mRNA target, epithelial cell-transforming sequence 2 (ECT2), promoting ECT2 mRNA decay, which further inhibited cellular apoptosis.
Conclusion
CircSETD3/FXR1/ECT2 axis plays a critical role in the acquired resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC. Our results highlight the potential of circSETD3 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for NSCLC patients with acquired gefitinib resistance.

Abstract: Many research groups work on overcoming the 30% power conversion efficiency (PCE) level for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with various approaches. The most common tandem architectures employ a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) front electrode. Due to its fast deposition and up-scalability, sputter deposition is the preferred method for TCO deposition. The sensitive layers of perovskite solar cells are protected from sputter damage by a thermal atomic layer (ALD) deposited tin oxide (SnO2) buffer layer, which induces parasitic absorption. Here, we propose a method to reveal the impact of sputter damage on SnO2 buffer layer-free devices. By performing light intensity-dependent current density-voltage (J-V) measurements and thereby reconstructing the single-junction solar cell pseudo J-V characteristics, we could associate sputter damage with trap-assisted non-radiative recombination losses. Additionally, we demonstrate a simple method to minimize sputter damage to the perovskite solar cell to the point where a protective SnO2 buffer layer is no longer required. By lowering the sputter power density during the TCO deposition, we regained ∼13 mV open-circuit voltage and ∼3% fill factor of the devices, improving the efficiency from 13.55 to 14.17%. We show that these improvements are linked to a reduction of transport and non-radiative recombination losses. Finally, we fabricated optically superior and sputter damage-free monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices without needing a protective SnO2 buffer layer. By doing so, we increased the tandem device current density by 0.52 mA/cm2, representing a crucial step toward further optimizing the optical performance of tandem devices.

Abstract: Polymeric coatings, widely used in large-scaled outdoor applications including solar energy collection, metal protection and so on, are limited by short service life caused by degradation and structural damage due to constant exposure in air and external force. Here, oxidized carbon black (OCB)/epoxy vitrimer (EV) composite without catalysts, dispersants and pre-heating was prepared by facile solvent mixing method. The addition of OCB improved the stress relaxation rate of the composite and endowed high solar absorptance (α) at 94.57% and solar thermal efficiency (η) at 93.28%. The efficiency of remote and local photothermal-stimulated healing for micro scratches of the composite coating was as high as 95.08%. And the macroscopic damage repairing which was rarely reported can be about 100% by a novel photothermal patching method. Meanwhile, the composites also have behaviors of shape memory, reusability and ion transfer barrier performance. Overall, based on the advantages of facile preparation, cheap raw materials, high solar absorptance and solar thermal efficiency and excellent remote and local healing efficiency, the OCB/EV composite coatings have potential applications in solar energy harvesting and provides a new strategy for the local and contactless repair of polymeric coatings used in outdoor applications such as solar-energy collector, solar absorption systems and metal protection, especially for the repair of the macroscopic damage.

Abstract: Multicolor electrochromic (EC) devices attract much attention because of their rich color changes. One of the major roadblocks in multicolor EC devices is the lack of a counter electrode that does not affect the color gamut of the working electrode. Minimally color-changing electrodes with sufficiently low coloration efficiency hold great promise for preparing multicolor EC devices. The development of minimally color-changing electrode materials as a charge balancing component is critical in EC devices for reducing their response time and operating voltage range, not interfering with the working electrode gamut. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of colloidal amorphous TaOx nanowires (NWs) by the “one-pot” pyrolysis method as the minimally color-changing electrode to prepare multicolor EC devices. It is found that the surfaces roughness of the colloidal TaOx NWs film is 4.4 nm, showing good film-forming performance. The TaOx NW electrode exhibits high transmittance and minimal color-changing in the EC process. As a proof of concept, multicolor EC devices are fabricated by using TaOx NW film as a counter electrode and polyaniline (PANI) as the working electrode. It is found that the NW film counter electrode can completely retain the true color of PANI in the device operation and also balance the charge generated by the EC electrode during the operation of the device, thereby narrowing the operating voltage and faster switching dynamics of the EC device. This work provides a solution-processed minimally color-changing electrode material for preparing high-performance anodic multicolor EC devices.

Abstract: Introduction
The Acute Leukemia-European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (AL-EBMT) risk score was recently developed and validated by Shouval et al.
Objective
To assess the ability of this score in predicting the 2-year overall survival (OS-2), leukemia-free survival (LFS-2) and transplant-related mortality (TRM) in acute leukemia (AL) adult patients undergoing a first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at a transplant center in Brazil.
Methods
In this prospective, cohort study, we used the formula published by Shouval et al. to calculate the AL-EBMT score and stratify patients into three risk categories.
Results
A total of 79 patients transplanted between 2008 and 2018 were analyzed. The median age was 38 years. Acute myeloid leukemia was the most common diagnosis (68%). Almost a quarter of the cases were at an advanced stage. All hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCTs) were human leukocyte antigen-matched (HLA-matched) and the majority used familial donors (77%). Myeloablative conditioning was used in 92% of the cases. Stratification according to the AL-EBMT score into low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups yielded the following results: 40%, 12% and 47% of the cases, respectively. The high scoring group was associated with a hazard ratio of 2.1 (p = 0.007), 2.1 (p = 0.009) and 2.47 (p = 0.01) for the 2-year OS, LFS and TRM, respectively.
Conclusion
This study supports the ability of the AL-EBMT score to reasonably predict the 2-year post-transplant OS, LFS and TRM and to discriminate between risk categories in adult patients with AL, thus confirming its usefulness in clinical decision-making in this setting. Larger, multicenter studies may further help confirm these findings.

Abstract: Introduction
The demand for apheresis platelets has increased in the recent past and the shrinking donor pool has shifted the trend to collection of double-dose or higher yield of platelets.
Objective
The present study aimed to determine the effect of double-dose plateletpheresis on the target yield and donor platelet recovery.
Methods
The study was conducted on 100 healthy plateletpheresis donors, 50 of whom were in the study group, which underwent double-dose plateletpheresis (DDP), and 50 of whom were in the control group for single-donor plateletpheresis. Pre- and post-procedure samples of donors were subjected to a complete blood count. The DDP product was sampled for platelet yield and then split into two parts. Platelet yield, collection efficiency, collection rate, recruitment factor and donor platelet loss were calculated.
Results
The mean platelet yield in the SDP was 4.09 ± 1.15 × 1011 and in the DDP, 5.93 ± 1.04 × 1011. There was a significant correlation between the pre-donation platelet count and platelet yield. The total of platelets processed for the SDP were 5.42 ± 1.08 × 1011 and for the DDP, 7.94 ± 0.77 × 1011. The collection efficiency was 71.93 ± 25.14% in the SDP and 72.94 ± 16.28% in the DDP, while the collection rates were 0.78 × 1011 and 0.94 × 1011 per minute, respectively. The average recruitment factor observed was 0.98 in the SDP, while it was 0.99 in the DDP. The mean platelet loss observed in the SDP was 35.55 ± 8.53% and in the DDP, 37.76 ± 8.65%.
Conclusion
The double-dose plateletpheresis supplements the platelet inventory in developing countries where the apheresis donor pool is limited. It is prudent to ensure stringent donor selection criteria for donors donating high-yield platelet products, thus enhancing donor safety and retention.

Abstract: Amorphous lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) films of various thicknesses were prepared by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering as an electrolyte layer for inorganic all-solid-state electrochromic devices.The ionic conductivity of LiPON films measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was all approximately 10−6 S/cm, and the average optical transmittance characterized by UV–Vis spectroscopy was over 80%, indicating that the prepared LiPON films were suitable for electrochromic applications. Monoclinic electrochromic devices (ECDs) (ITO/NiOx/LiPON/WO3/ITO) with different LiPON thicknesses were fabricated and studied. It was found that the electro-optical properties of the ECDs could be significantly affected by the thickness and surface roughness of LiPON films. The ECDs demonstrated the best combination of optical contrast (68.4% at 560 nm), switching time (27s), and cycling stability (optical modulation degradation of 6.93% for 200 cycles) when the LiPON thickness was 450 nm. The above results not only shed lights on improving the interfacial properties of solid electrolytes, but also give directions for the performance enhancement of inorganic all-solid electrochromic devices.

Abstract: Introduction
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2* technique is used to assess iron overload in the heart, liver and pancreas of thalassaemic patients. Optimal iron chelation and expected tissue iron response rates remain under investigation. The objective of this study was to analyse serum ferritin and the iron concentration in the heart, liver and pancreas measured by MRI T2*/R2* during regular chelation therapy in a real-world cohort of patients with thalassemia.
Methods
We evaluated thalassaemic patients ≥ 7 years old undergoing chelation/transfusion therapy by MRI and assessed serum ferritin at baseline and follow-up from 2004-2011.
Results
We evaluated 136 patients, 92% major thalassaemic, with a median age of 18 years, and median baseline ferritin 2.033ng/ml (range: 59–14,123). Iron overload distribution was: liver (99%), pancreas (74%) and heart (36%). After a median of 1.2 years of follow-up, the iron overload in the myocardium reduced from 2,63 Fe mg/g to 2,05 (p 0.003). The optimal R2* pancreas cut-off was 148 Hertz, achieving 78% sensitivity and 73% specificity. However, when combining the R2* pancreas cut off ≤ 50 Hertz and a ferritin ≤ 1222 ng/ml, we could reach a negative predictive value (NPV) of 98% for cardiac siderosis. Only 28% were undergoing combined chelation at baseline assessment, which increased up to 50% on follow up evaluation.
Conclusions
Chelation therapy significantly reduced cardiac siderosis in thalassaemic patients. In patients with moderate/severe liver iron concentration undergoing chelation therapy, ferritin levels and myocardium iron improved earlier than the liver siderosis.

Abstract: The efficiency of endometrial stromal cells (ESC) decidualization is a critical player in successful embryo implantation and further pregnancy development. Epigenetic mechanisms strictly regulate massive changes that affect endometrium in each cycle, so investigating epigenetic patterns could help identify endometrial targets for infertility treatment solutions. The aim of our study was to analyze the changes in epigenetic modulators, histone modifications, and DNA methylation during induced human ESC in vitro decidualization. Decidualization markers and epigenetic factors’ gene and protein expression levels were assessed during ESC cells in vitro decidualization, performing RT-qPCR and immunoblot tests. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) analysis by the following qPCR were conducted to evaluate the level of H4hyperAc and 5-methylcytosine in the decidualization-associated gene promoter and exon regions accordingly. Our results revealed that ESC decidualization caused the down-regulation of HDAC2 and subunits of PRC2. We observed the increased global level of H4hyperAc and H3K27me3. We also demonstrated that H4hyperAc was specifically enriched in the decidualization-associated genes (WNT4, HAND2, STAT5A) promoter regions during ESC decidualization. In contrast, the DNA methylation level in these promoter regions was relatively low before ESC induction and did not vary through ESC decidualization. Our findings demonstrate that specific gene promoters' histone acetylation increases during the induced ESC decidualization, which indicates the importance of epigenetic regulation in endometrial decidualization.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive lung disease of unknown etiology characterized by distorted distal lung architecture, inflammation, and fibrosis. Several lung cell types, including alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts, have been implicated in the development and progression of fibrosis. However, the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is still incompletely understood. The latest research has found that dysregulation of lipid metabolism plays an important role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The changes in the synthesis and activity of fatty acids, cholesterol and other lipids seriously affect the regenerative function of alveolar epithelial cells and promote the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Mitochondrial function is the key to regulating the metabolic needs of a variety of cells, including alveolar epithelial cells. Sirtuins located in mitochondria are essential to maintain mitochondrial function and cellular metabolic homeostasis. Sirtuins can maintain normal lipid metabolism by regulating respiratory enzyme activity, resisting oxidative stress, and protecting mitochondrial function. In this review, we aimed to discuss the difference between normal and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lungs in terms of lipid metabolism. Additionally, we highlight recent breakthroughs on the effect of abnormal lipid metabolism on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, including the effects of sirtuins. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has its high mortality and limited therapeutic options; therefore, we believe that this review will help to develop a new therapeutic direction from the aspect of lipid metabolism in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Background
Elevated serum progranulin (PGRN) levels have been associated with a wide range of different human malignancies. However, data available on the role of PGRN in hematological malignancies are limited.
Methods
Measurement of the PGRN level in serum of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed.
Results
The mean serum PGRN level in AML patients was higher than that in controls (346.08 pg/ml ± 64.46 vs 155 pg/ml ± 63 respectively; p = 0.001). After a mean duration of follow-up equaling 140 days, patients with high serum PGRN (i.e., higher than 370.5 pg/ml) had inferior overall survival (OS) in comparison to patients with low serum PGRN (i.e., lower than 370.5 pg/ml) (OS = 25% vs 60.7%, mean survival = 107 days vs 256.5 days, p = 0.007). On the other hand, remitted patients on day 28 with high serum PGRN (i.e., higher than 307.5 pg/ml) did not differ from those with low serum PGRN (i.e., lower than 307.5 pg/ml) regarding disease-free survival (DFS) (DFS = 78.6% vs. 87.5%, mean survival = 301.3 days vs. 283.5 days, p = 0.789). Moreover, the serum PGRN level was associated with inferior OS (p = 0.024) on multivariate analysis.
Conclusion
Adult de novo AML patients have elevated serum PGRN levels and a high PGRN level is associated with an inferior OS.

Abstract: We present here a thorough study of a one-step metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) method to reduce the reflectivity of monocrystalline silicon (mono c-Si) wafers, thus increasing their light capture efficiency. The method uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrofluoric acid (HF) as etchants and silver (Ag) as reaction catalyst. In this study, we inspected the impact of the etchant molar ratio (ρ = [HF]/(HF + H2O2]) in the reaction dynamics and the properties of the etched wafers. For each texturing solution used the etching time was swept, thus characterizing the process evolution over time. The results obtained showed that solutions with a lower molar ratio are more reactive, making the etching process particularly fast. Reflectance measurements proved the capability of the MACE process to sharply reduce the reflectance in the range 350–1100 nm. Scan electron microscope (SEM) observations confirmed the random nature of obtained nanostructures. For several etchant solutions tested an effective reflectivity (Reff) lower than 5% was obtained and a minimum of Reff = 3.0% for ρ = 0.916 was reached.

Abstract: Background
Colorectal cancer is the second most common malignant tumor worldwide. A deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying colorectal cancer metastasis is urgently needed. G-protein signaling modulator 1 and autophagy play critical roles in tumor migration and invasion. However, the biological functions and regulatory networks of G-protein signaling modulator 1 and autophagy have not yet been fully studied.
Methods
We performed immunohistochemistry and clinic-pathological characteristic analysis in 328 human colorectal cancer specimens to identify the clinical role of G-protein signaling modulator 1 in colorectal cancer. An in vitro coculture system and a tumor metastasis mouse model were used to explore the biological function of G-protein signaling modulator 1 on tumor metastasis. Autophagic flux detection like GFP-LC3B signal immunofluorescence and electron microscope observation of autophagic vesicles and confocal microscope detection were used to gain insights into the underlying role of G-protein signaling modulator 1 in autophagy.
Results
We found that G-protein signaling modulator 1 was abundantly expressed in colorectal cancer tissues and was associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Furthermore, our bioinformatic and functional studies demonstrated that G-protein signaling modulator 1 significantly promoted cell migration and invasion, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that G-protein signaling modulator 1 could promote colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion and inhibit autophagy and by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
Conclusions
We proposed that G-protein signaling modulator 1 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis by modulating autophagy through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

Abstract: In recent years, some minor elements are added into silver paste in order to improve the Ag/Si contact properties for crystalline silicon solar cells. Nevertheless, along with the addition of minor elements, the early discoloration of silver electrode appears on solar cells. In this work, the deteriorated silver alloy electrode on crystalline silicon solar cells was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results prove that there exists a small amount of bismuth sulfide on the surface of the deteriorated electrode compared with normal electrode. An important finding is that the photocatalytic reaction of bismuth sulfide can accelerate the early discoloration of the silver alloy electrode. Then, the effect of silver alloy electrode deterioration on the peel force of ribbon for solar cells was investigated. The results indicate that the peel strength between ribbons and solar cells is decreased sharply due to the poor solderability of the deteriorated electrode. Additionally, it is found that the deteriorated silver alloy electrode can be recovered at 450 °C annealing for 60 s in a sintering furnace. After recovery experiments, the average peel force of ribbons attached to recovered busbars is up to 85% of normal busbars. The peel force of ribbon is significantly improved. The results obtained in this paper indicate that more attention should be given to the negative effect of minor elements on the electrode, when minor elements are added into silver paste to improve its performance.

Abstract: Impedance spectroscopy (IS) is a powerful characterization technique that is commonly applied to organic, perovskite, and thin-film solar cells. However, it has not been widely applied to solar cells based on crystalline silicon (c-Si), which is by far the most relevant commercial technology, and particularly not to modern, high-efficiency silicon devices. In this work, we demonstrate the application of the IS technique to a 21.25% efficient c-Si solar cell featuring SiOx/poly-Si rear passivating contacts. This type of cell architecture is structurally similar to that of current high-efficiency industrial devices. The investigated cell was measured over a wide range of frequencies under illuminated open-circuit conditions and under different DC biases in darkness. The resistive and capacitive components associated with the p+–n junction and at n+-poly–n low–high junction, which cannot be resolved by standard DC measurements, are readily distinguished by the IS method. These parameters allowed for the determination of junction time constants and lifetimes. We find that the lifetimes derived from IS measurements performed under open-circuit illuminated conditions are in excellent agreement with the carrier recombination lifetime under illumination. Our findings demonstrate that IS is a promising technique to explore various dynamic properties of high-efficiency c-Si solar cells.

Abstract: Background
Due to its effective osteogenic ability, BMP9 is a promising candidate for bone regeneration medicine. Whereas, BMP9 can also induce adipogenesis simultaneously. LCN2 is a cytokine associated with osteogenesis and adipogenesis. Reducing the adipogenic potential may be a feasible measure to enhance the osteogenic capability of BMP9.
Objective
The objective of the study was to explore the role of LCN2 in regulating the BMP9-initialized osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and clarify the possible underlying mechanism.
Methods
Histochemical stain, western blot, real-time PCR, laser confocal, immunoprecipitation, cranial defect repair, and fetal limb culture assays were used to evaluate the effects of LCN2 on BMP9-induced osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation, as well as Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
Results
LCN2 was down-regulated by BMP9. The BMP9-induced osteogenic markers were inhibited by LCN2 overexpression, but the adipogenic markers were increased; LCN2 knockdown exhibited opposite effects. Similar results were found in bone defect repair and fetal limb culture tests. The level of β-catenin nucleus translocation was found to be reduced by LCN2 overexpression, but increased by LCN2 knockdown. The inhibitory effect of LCN2 overexpression on the osteogenic capability of BMP9 was reversed by β-catenin overexpression; whereas, the effect of LCN2 knockdown on promoting BMP9 osteogenic potential was almost eliminated by β-catenin knockdown. LCN2 could bind with LRP6 specifically, and the inhibitory effect of LCN2 on the osteogenic potential of BMP9 could not be enhanced by LRP6 knockdown.
Conclusion
LCN2 inhibits the BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation but promotes its adipogenic potential in MEFs, which may be partially mediated by reducing Wnt/β-catenin signaling via binding with LRP6.

Abstract: Antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) is a promising photovoltaic absorber, which has so far been fabricated mainly by chemical deposition methods. Despite its aptness for congruent sublimation, less research efforts have been made on low-temperature Sb2S3 processing by physical methods. In this regard, recent studies show large variation in the processing temperature of Sb2S3 films, which overall brings into question the need for higher substrate temperatures (>350 °C). Furthermore, in-depth analysis of defect structure of Sb2S3 employing temperature-dependent admittance spectroscopy (TAS) and photoluminescence (PL) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically study the effect of close-spaced sublimation (CSS) substrate temperature on Sb2S3 absorber growth, employing a wide temperature range of 240–400 °C. Temperatures above 320 °C caused cracking phenomena in the Sb2S3 absorber film, proving the unviability of higher processing temperatures. CSS processing temperature of 300 °C was found optimal, producing crack-free Sb2S3 films with increased presence of (hk1) planes, and achieving the best CdS/Sb2S3 device with photoconversion efficiency of 3.8%. TAS study revealed two deep defects with activation energies of 0.32 eV and 0.37 eV. Low-temperature PL measurement revealed a band-to-band emission at 1.72 eV and a broad band peaked at 1.40 eV, which was assigned to a donor-acceptor pair recombination. Temperature-dependent I-V analysis showed that recombination at CdS–Sb2S3 interface remains a large limitation for the device efficiency.

Abstract: The passive radiative cooling (PRC) approach allows zero-energy cooling by reflecting solar light and radiating heat simultaneously. However, most of the current PRC materials, especially polymer-based ones, are not able to be naturally degraded in the environment over a short time period when discarded, causing the current white pollution problem. Herein, we demonstrate a novel PRC material based on eco-friendly fiber membrane derived from biomass-derived silk fibroin (SF) and polylactic acid (PLA), which can be quickly degraded in outdoor soil environment for just one month. The resulting SF/PLA fiber membrane achieved ultra-high solar reflectance R‾solar and infrared emittance ε‾IR of 96.1% and ∼95.4%, respectively, and yielded an average sub-ambient cooling temperature of ∼6 °C even under a peak solar intensity of ∼900 W m−2 owing to its outstanding optical properties. In addition, large-scale products were prepared by simple and cost-effective electrostatic spinning-based manufacturing process. This study offers a new strategy that combines biodegradation with zero-energy cooling and shows great potential for widespread future applications, substantially decreasing energy consumption and carbon emission.

Abstract: Epibrassinolide is a member of brassinosteroids with a polyhydroxysteroid structure similar to steroid hormones of vertebrates. It was shown that EBR decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in different colon cancer cell lines without exerting a cytotoxic effect in epithelial fetal human colon cells. This finding highlighted the potential of epibrassinolide in clinical therapeutic setup. In our previous studies, we showed that epibrassinolide was able to induce apoptosis via endoplasmic reticulum stress. Recently, we also showed that endoplasmic reticulum and apoptotic stresses can be prevented via autophagic induction in non-cancerous epithelial or aggressive forms of cancer cells. Therefore, here in this study, we evaluated the anti-tumoral effect of epibrassinolide as well as the autophagy involvement in the aggressive forms of colon cancer cell lines as well as in vivo SCID mouse xenograft colon cancer model for the first time. For this purpose, SCID mouse model was used for subcutaneous injection of colon cancer cells in matrigel formulation. We found that autophagy is induced in both in vitro and in vivo models. Following tumor formation, SCID mice were treated daily with increasing concentrations of epibrassinolide for two weeks. Our findings showed that EBR inhibited the volume and diameter of the tumor in a dose-dependent manner by causing cell cycle arrest. Therefore our data suggest that epibrassinolide exerts a cytostatic effect on the agrressive form of colon cancer model in vivo, without affecting endoplasmic reticulum stress and the induction of autophagy might have role in this effect of epibrassinolide.

Abstract: Considering the boom of Si solar cell installation, it is necessary to establish a process for recycling of Si from End-of-life photovoltaics (PVs). Silicon in the PVs is synthetically doped and coated by various elements and hence dedicated methods will be required for recycling of Si, back to the SoG-Si. In this research, recycling of Si from the shredded solar cells is studied by means of vacuum refining process. In this research the rejected solar cells after the firing step are treated by acid etching techniques to remove the Al back layer and the Ag finger on the front side of the cells, providing a product called de-metallized Si fragments. The vacuum refining experiments were carried out on demetallized Si fragments. Results showed the demetallized Si contained presence of P (11.67 ppmw), B (1 ppmw), Ca with up to 0.28 wt%, Ag (96 ppmw) and Sn (136 ppmw), while other metallic impurities were lower. We have shown that Sn, Ag, O, N, and Mg can be removed from the Si melt via short vacuum refining, while a complete removal of Ca and P required longer times compared to the mentioned impurities. Because vacuum refining process is not limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, a full removal of all the volatile impurities at extended times is expected and then this process has a high chance for returning the recovered Si to the solar grade requirements.

Abstract: As the solar photovoltaics power system sees rapid growth in installed capacity and plays a significant role in the future global energy mix, its reliability becomes a crucial factor in maintaining the stability of the electricity supply. Manufacturing imperfections and harsh operating environments may compromise the module's structural integrity, leading to performance deterioration and power loss. Therefore, nondestructive inspection becomes an indispensable part of the quality assurance or maintenance program to detect defects at any stage of the module's lifecycle. Ultrasound is an essential method for material inspection, and ultrasonic-guided waves have been long explored as a flaw detection technique on plate-like structures, taking advantage of its long-range detection that yields an efficient inspection process superior to the conventional pulse-echo technique. Inspired by the same idea, this work assesses the prospect of harnessing ultrasonic guided waves, particularly Lamb waves, to detect cracks, as they exist in an actual module. However, unlike the commonly investigated plates, solar photovoltaic modules contain stacks of a-few-microns-thick layers of different materials that add complexities to the structure. The investigated specimen is a thin film photovoltaic module with cracks caused during transportation and handling. It, therefore, represents a real-life research case that may occur in situ. Numerical and experimental methods are performed to reveal various Lamb modes that propagate in the structure, where the results of both methods are mutually confirmed. Unlike other works, this investigation is not confined to the utilization of the non-dispersive mode but attempts to find the defect-sensitive mode that can be used to detect cracks. An analysis of the experimental results reveals the mode most sensitive to cracks, while numerical simulations explain the corresponding phenomena.

Abstract: The activation and proliferation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are critical processes for the treatment of liver fibrosis. It is necessary to identify effective drugs for the treatment of liver fibrosis and elucidate their mechanisms of action. Metformin can inhibit HSCs; however, no systematic studies demonstrating the effects of metformin on mitochondria in HSCs have been reported. This study demonstrated that metformin induces mitochondrial fission by phosphorylating AMPK/DRP1 (S616) in HSCs to decrease the expression of α-SMA and collagen. Additionally, metformin repressed the total ATP production rate, especially the production rate of ATP produced through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of complex I. Further analysis revealed that metformin strongly constrained the transcription of mitochondrial genes (ND1–ND6 and ND4L) that encode the core subunits of respiratory chain I. Upregulation of the mRNA expression of HK2 and GLUT1 slightly enhanced glycolysis. Additionally, metformin increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number to suppress the proliferation and activation of HSCs, indicating that mtDNA copy number can alter the fate of HSCs. In conclusion, metformin can induce mitochondrial fragmentation and low-level energy metabolism in HSCs, thereby suppressing HSCs activation and proliferation to reverse liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Integrating solar cells in textiles offers a promising path toward energy-autonomous wearable electronics, but their design requires careful optimisation between energy efficiency and visual aesthetics. For this purpose, we present a systematic study of the optical properties of knitted textiles as visually concealing covers for textile-integrated solar cells. The study investigates microscopic and macroscopic factors that influence the optical performance of knitted textiles. A set of 175 samples was knitted, including 20 knit structures, 6 yarn materials, and 20 yarn colours. The knitted samples were studied using optical characterisation methods such as spectroscopy, microscopy, and photography. We developed metrics characterising solar cell performance and visual appearance, which can be used to optimise textiles based on desired performance characteristics. The strong correlation between the performance metrics demonstrates a design compromise between solar cell performance and concealment. By applying a proposed set of optimisation criteria to the knitted samples, 23 out of the 175 samples qualified as the best in solar cell performance and concealment. The developed metrics are also applicable to other textile configurations and light-sensing applications.

Abstract: Perimenopause is a natural transition to menopause, when hormone disturbance can result in both short-term mental disorders, such as anxiety, and long-term neuroinflammation due to blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment, which may lead to more serious neurological disorders later on, such as dementia. Effective treatments may prevent both short-term and long-term neurological sequela, which formed the aim of this study. In aged female C57BL/6 mice (16–18 months of age), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) differentiated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), were administered via tail vein injection. Mice showed increased blood estrogen levels, alleviated anxiety and neuroinflammation, and improved BBB integrity. Interestingly, transplanted MSCs were located close to ovarian sympathetic nerves and decreased ovarian norepinephrine levels, which in turn increased ovarian estrogen secretion. Moreover, the administration of anastrozole, an inhibitor of estrogen synthesis, diminished the therapeutic effects of MSCs in vivo, suggesting the effect to be estrogen-dependent. In vitro study confirmed the impact of MSCs on sympathetic nerves via mitochondria exchange. In conclusion, iPSC-derived MSCs may provide a novel option to manage perimenopause-related hormonal dysregulation and neurological disorders during the female aging process.

Abstract: Introduction
Plasma transfusion is a common therapeutic strategy used to lower international normalized ratio (INR) values in the non-emergent setting. However, due to lack of evidence of its efficacy, standardized guidelines for this practice have not been well established.
Methods
This retrospective observational cohort study analyzed 276 inpatient encounters that involved plasma transfusions focusing on change in INR values from pre- to post-transfusion, with respect to the following predictor variables: vitamin K co-administration, number of plasma units transfused, order indication and body mass index (BMI).
Results
The overall average change in the INR was 1.35. Patients who received vitamin K showed an average change of 2.51, while patients that did not receive vitamin K demonstrated an average change of 0.70. Increased numbers of plasma units transfused showed benefit up to three-unit orders. Greater decreases in the INR were observed for patients requiring plasma for anticoagulation reversal or active bleeding. There was no significant difference in the change in INR based on the BMI. By multivariate and regression analyses, the stepwise addition of each successive predictor variable demonstrated an increase in the shared variance in the outcome of the post-transfusion INR: the pre-transfusion INR and vitamin K co-administration alone was not significant (p = 0.45); the additional number of plasma units transfused was significant (R² = 0.13, p < 0.001), and; the subsequent additional plasma order indications (R² = 0.19, p < 0.001) and BMI (R² = 0.18, p < 0.001) were increasingly significant.
Conclusion
Taking into consideration the combination of multiple predictive factors may aid in a more efficient use of plasma products.

Abstract: In concentrated solar power (CSP) technology, molten salt is one of the highly competitive phase change energy storage materials due to large energy storage densities and good chemical resistance. However, the lack of precise methodological guidance for designing high enthalpy eutectic salts limits the widespread and efficient application of molten salts. Here, we first present a method for accurately assessing the enthalpy of eutectic salt by first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations. By simulating two extreme states infinitely close to the pure solid and pure liquid at the phase transition temperature, the fusion enthalpy of a new ternary eutectic salt (K2CO3-Li2CO3-NaF) is accurately predicted with a calculation error as low as 6.4%. This work provides theoretical guidance for predicting the enthalpy of molten salts and lays the foundation for their widespread application.

Abstract: Solar thermal energy storage based on phase change materials (PCMs) plays a significant role in overcoming the intermittent and fluctuating nature of solar irradiation. However, the weak solar absorptance, intrinsic low thermal conductivity, and leakage problems preclude efficient solar energy storage harvesting and storage. Herein, eco-friendly, anisotropic, large porosity wood-derived SiC ceramics is proposed to overcome the above bottleneck problems and achieve rapid solar thermal energy storage. We report a synergetic strategy to fabricate composite phase change materials (CPCMs) with high thermal conductivity and large energy storage density by partially removing the interwoven lignin and hemicellulose from natural wood. The porosity of the porous wood-derived SiC ceramics can be increased from 55% to 80%, beyond the porosity limitation of conventional wood. Vertically aligned channels and compact SiC grains serve as thermal transport highways and enable resultant CPCMs to exhibit a high thermal conductivity of 31.2 W/mK even at a porosity of up to 80%. The solar absorptance of proposed composites (89%) is significantly higher than that of pure PCMs, enabling them to capture solar energy effectively. This work provides a synergetic strategy for achieving efficient solar energy harvesting, fast conversion, and high-density storage simultaneously via proposed eco-friendly and large porosity wood-derived SiC ceramics-based phase change composites.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the effect of H2O partial pressure on the chemical characteristic and optoelectrical properties of the indium tin oxide (ITO) films and the performance and stability of heterojunction (HJT) solar cells. The H2O with varying partial pressure from 2.72 × 10−5 Pa to 8.38 × 10−5 Pa is obtained from the residual gas in the magnetron sputtering device chamber. With the H2O partial pressure raises, the resistivity of ITO films increases from 3.6 × 10−4 Ω·cm to 5.3 × 10−4 Ω·cm, and the effective total transmittance improves slightly in the near-infrared region. The efficiency of HJT solar cells with ITO films deposited at high H2O partial pressure is lower due to the deterioration of fill factor (FF), even though the short circuit current (Isc) increased. Thus, the maximum HJT solar cell efficiency of 25.30% is achieved at low H2O partial pressure. In addition, the performance of HJT solar cells under a nitrogen environment without illumination was tracked. It is observed that the high cell efficiency obtained with low H2O partial pressure has a larger degradation, which is mainly derived from the FF degradation.

Abstract: The active proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells supports the healing of vessel damage while their abnormal aggression or destitution contribute to the aberrant intima-medial structure and function in various cardiovascular diseases, so the understanding of the proliferation disorders of vascular smooth muscle cell and the related mechanism is the basis of effective intervention and control for cardiovascular diseases. Recently, long non-coding RNAs have stood out as upstream switchers for multiple proliferative signaling pathways and molecules, and many of them have been shown to conduce to the dysregulated proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells under various pathogenic stimuli. This article discusses the long non-coding RNAs disclosed and linked to atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, and aneurysms, and focuses upon their modulation of vascular smooth muscle cell population affecting three deadly cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Scalable and sustainable photovoltaic technologies require low-cost and earth-abundant semiconducting materials. Zinc phosphide is purported to be an absorber material with optimal photovoltaic properties. Herein we report the electrical properties of Zn3P2 thin films with different crystallinity grown on InP substrates. The room temperature electrical resistivity of the as-grown single crystal thin films is found to be in the range of 42–1050 Ω cm. We correlate the crystalline quality and composition to the electrical properties. Capacitance-voltage measurements and secondary ion mass spectroscopy demonstrate the direct correlation between the carrier concentration and the Zn/P ratio. The highest hole mobility value (125 cm2/Vs) was obtained from high-quality single crystalline Zn3P2 thin films. The electrical characteristics of the heterojunction between the thin film and the substrate were also illustrated. This work sheds light on the electrical properties and conduction mechanism, thus providing a better understanding of the limitations and potentials of the electrical devices related to the material.

Abstract: Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) and thin crystalline silicon (c-Si) are considered suitable top- and bottom-cell candidates for tandem solar cells (TSCs), owing to their natural abundance, non-toxicity, cost-competitiveness, and complementary bandgaps. The current work proposes and investigates a two-terminal (2T) monolithic Sb2S3/Si thin film TSC via TCAD simulation. The Sb2S3 cell, with a bandgap of 1.7 eV, is utilized as a top sub-cell, and the bottom sub-cell is utilized by a thin c-Si cell having a bandgap of 1.12 eV. The calibrated standalone top and bottom cells provide a power conversion efficiency (η) of 4.31% and 14.26%, respectively. Upon incorporating the two cells into a 2T Sb2S3/Si monolithic TSC, the resultant tandem cell achieves an η of 10.10% implying that the top cell should be optimized in order to get a tandem efficiency higher than the bottom cell. Thus, the Sb2S3 cell is optimized by designing the cell without the organic hole transport layer (HTL) (resulting in an np heterojunction) and engineering the conduction band offset (CBO) between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the Sb2S3 absorber. Then, the tandem structure is optimized starting from the ETL thickness and doping concentration. Also, the impact of changing the absorber defect density and the series resistance of the top cell on the TSC performance is investigated to demonstrate the maximum available η. At reduced defect density and series resistance, the overall efficiency of the tandem cell is improved to 19.51%. Furthermore, we explored the impact of top and bottom absorber thicknesses on TSC working metrics. At the designed matching point, the tandem efficiency is enhanced to 23.25%, and Jsc also boosts to 17.24 mA/cm2. The simulation study is intended to provide a tandem configuration that is based on an all-thin-film design which may be suitable for applications like wearable electronics due to its flexibility. All TCAD simulations are performed using the Silvaco Atlas simulator under standard one Sun (AM1.5G, 1000 W/m2) illumination.

Abstract: Conducting polymers (CPs) are commonly explored in electrochromic devices (ECDs) because of their designable compound structure, rich color, fast switching speed, flexibility and high coloration efficiency. However, the preparation of large-size nanostructured electrochromic polymer (ECP) films is still a great challenge. Herein, we present a facile and efficient strategy to construct neat large-size nanostructured ECP films without molecular design. Polyterthiophene (PTTh), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(2,2′-bithiophene) (PBTh) are selected as the model polymers due to their good EC behaviors. The PTTh hollow microspheres, PEDOT and PBTh nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization without templates, and then were made into stable dispersions, which were processed into films by spray-coating method. The obtained films were further assembled into the ECDs. We investigated the structure, morphology and electrochemical properties of PTTh, PEDOT and PBTh films, and EC performance of corresponding ECDs. The results indicate that the uniform and loose PTTh film possesses 3D porous structure composed of many hollow microspheres, while the PEDOT and PBTh films consist of many NPs. These films exhibit good electrochemical performance. The ECD based on PEDOT film achieves an optical contrast of 29%, coloration efficiency of 217 cm2/C, and its coloration time and bleaching time are 3.48 and 0.09 s, respectively. This study suggests that in situ chemical oxidative polymerization preparation of ECP microspheres or NPs might be a facile strategy for fabricating neat large-size ECP films, and its preparation process is easily conducted, showing great potential applications in conducting polymer-based ECDs.

Abstract: Chlamydia psittaci is a multi-host zoonotic pathogen, which mainly infects poultry and inflicts an appreciable economic burden on the livestock farming industry. C. psittaci inclusion membrane proteins are uniquely positioned at the host-pathogen interface and are important virulence proteins. We have previously confirmed that Incs regulate host cell survival to help Chlamydia sp. evade host-cell-mediated defense mechanisms. However, the role of the Inc, CPSIT_0842, in the regulation of cell death following the establishment of persistent C. psittaci infection remains unknown. This study explored the effect of CPSIT_0842 on the crosstalk between the autophagic and apoptotic pathways in macrophages. Results showed that CPSIT_0842 initiated autophagy and blocked autophagic flux in human macrophages, as indicated by autophagy-related protein LC3-II, Beclin-1, and p62 upregulation, autophagosome accumulation, and lysosomal protein LAMP1 diminution. We also showed that the disruption of autophagic flux had a regulatory effect on CPSIT_0842-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the suppression of autophagy initiation by 3-methyladenine attenuated CPSIT_0842-induced apoptosis. By contrast, the induction of autophagic flux by rapamycin did not significantly affect CPSIT_0842-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that CPSIT_0842 induced macrophage apoptosis by initiating incomplete autophagy through the MAPK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway, which may be instrumental to the ability of C. psittaci to evade the host innate immune response and establish persistent infection. The improved understanding of the autophagic and cell death pathways triggered upon bacterial inclusion will likely help in the development of novel treatment strategies for chlamydia infection.

Abstract: The pivotal structure of n-TOPCon (tunnel oxide passivating contact) solar cells is the passivating contact structure composed of a heavily doped polysilicon (poly-Si) layer and an ultrathin silicon oxide (SiOx), which can provide excellent selectively carrier transport. The activated phosphorus concentration in the passivating contact structure plays a crucial role in the passivation quality and contact resistivity performance. By adjusting PH3 flow rate, SiOx thickness and activation temperature, three different activated phosphorus concentrations in poly-Si were achieved in this work, the phosphorus concentration from SiOx to silicon bulk decreased at the same rate. It can be found that the passivation quality decreases with increasing concentration and the contact resistivity decreases significantly. With the aid of ellipsometry, we successfully extracted the refractive index n and extinction coefficient k of three poly-Si with different activated phosphorus concentrations. The extracted n and k values can well feedback the influence of concentration change on short-circuit current density in the simulation. Due to the high concentration led to the decrease of the open circuit voltage and short circuit current of the final TOPCon solar cell, but the obvious filling factor benefit can be obtained, only moderate doping concentration can obtain the best efficiency performance. Finally, the activated phosphorus concentration of about 3 × 1020 cm−1 can obtain the best efficiency, >24.8% on average.

Abstract: The mechanisms leading to corrosion in stainless steel containments for thermal energy storage through phase change materials, such as carbonates and chlorides, are crucial for understanding the degradation of these steel alloys. A comprehensive study of this area will allow for down-selection of materials suitable for solar thermal energy storage (TES) operation at an elevated temperature range. Samples of stainless steel (SS) 316L were subjected to a cyclic heat environment of 550–750 °C in air and argon headspace environments, in the presence of a carbonate salt phase change material (PCM). A series of complementary microscopy, spectroscopy and diffractometry analytical techniques were applied to the corroded SS316L. Corrosion rate, interface formation and chemical products with respect to thermal cycling are presented with associated degradation mechanism explained and comparisons are made among different gas environments and varied immersion conditions. In the PCM under ambient air conditions, steel surfaces were mainly corroded by the penetration of oxidants from air, such as H2O or O2, along grain boundaries. SS316L samples demonstrated more severe degradation when exposed to air with a small fraction of PCM vapour present compared to when they were exposed to liquid or solid PCM. Cycling in Ar resulted in less corrosion in samples as opposed to when they were exposed to an air environment. In an Ar environment corrosion is driven via the formation of chromite, while the SS316L showed a less degradation when exposed to Ar with a small fraction of PCM vapour compared to when it was immersed in PCM. The mechanisms for degradation in air and in Ar are common in that the corrosion products of Cr and Ni dissolve in the PCM thus removing any layer that could protect against corrosion. The present study provides insight into corrosion of stainless-steel when exposed to carbonate salts, in air and inert gas environments, and contributes to down-selection of materials for solar thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by a poor prognosis. Our previous work suggested that Protocadherin 20 (PCDH20) promoted ferroptosis in HCC. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Recently, we found that both the mRNA and protein levels of PCDH20 were upregulated in erastin- or sorafenib-treated HCC cells. Meanwhile, data showed that Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) was markedly downregulated in PCDH20-SNU-449 cells. Additionally, overexpression of PCDH20 or erastin-treated cells dramatically decreased cell viability and colony-forming capacity of HCC cells, whereas blocking PCDH20 reversed these effects. Moreover, PCDH20 overexpression or treatment with erastin significantly downregulated the expression of SIRT1, Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), as well as the ferroptosis-related protein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and glutathione (GSH), while elevated malondialdehyde (MDA), 2′− 7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) and intercellular iron levels. Conversely, knockdown of PCDH20 upregulated SIRT1 and SLC7A11. Immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that PCDH20 or erastin increased the amount of acetylated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (NRF2). This reducing effect of NRF2 deacetylation by PCDH20 was counteracted by restoring the expression of SIRT1. In addition, PCDH20 lowered the levels of GPX4, GSH, and cell viability, as well as resulted in an elevation in intercellular iron level, MDA, and DCF. These effects were reversed by SIRT1 expression. Besides, PCDH20 could promote ferroptosis by inhibiting SIRT1 from deacetylating NRF2, which led to the downregulation of SLC7A11, GPX4, and GSH both in vivo and in vitro. Our results signals that PCDH20 promotes ferroptosis by suppressing the expression of SIRT1 and thus, promoting the acetylation of NRF2in HCC.

Abstract: Coupling with supercritical power cycle can improve the thermal efficiency of the concentrated solar system. Design the suitable thermal storage medium is critical to the new coupling system. A new ternary eutectic salt with low cost was developed composed of NaCl, Na2CO3, and Na2SO4 based on the calculation method of phase diagram, meeting the requirements of solar energy storage over 873 K. The eutectic point and composition of the designed salt were predicted to be 900 K and 50 mol% NaCl-35 mol% Na2CO3-15 mol% Na2SO4. The designed salt shows high specific heat capacity and phase-change enthalpy, and low cost, which indicates it has good thermal storage capacity. Composite phase change materials with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene nanosheets which can enhance the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of designed salt were prepared. The effects of preparation methods on the thermophysical properties of the composite phase change materials were analyzed.

Abstract: Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are one of the most efficient ways to improve the performance of the photovoltaic industry and should be viewed as a promising path in the photovoltaic field. The silicon photovoltaic modules have a lifespan of over 20 years, while the low device stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) remains a significant commercialization barrier. An air gap acts as an optical spacer layer for four terminal (4T) perovskite/silicon tandem cells, resulting in a loss of efficiency. Using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as an intermediate matching layer (IML) and a clip-on design made of a PDMS-based material sandwiched between polyvinyl chloride (PVC) layers with the configuration of PVC/IML/PVC, this research not only achieved efficiency improvement of four-contact tandem solar cells but also greatly simplified disassembly of individual cells. The 4T perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem cells with a clip-on design achieved the highest efficiency of 23.49% for the active area of 1 cm2, while the fully tandem configuration without a clip-on layer only exhibited a PCE of 22.83%. The clip-on technology has the potential to boost the current density of silicon heterojunction solar cells from 15.01 mA/cm2 (for the filtered bottom cell with an air gap) up to 16.51 mA/cm2 (for the filtered bottom cell with a clip-on). Therefore, this state-of-the-art allows for the removal of PSCs with a shorter lifespan while adhering two photovoltaic cells together securely and effectively.

Abstract: The inherent fluctuation of solar irradiation will seriously affect the stability of energy transfer of traditional photothermal conversion materials. Photothermal conversion phase change materials can combine the mechanisms of photothermal conversion and phase transformation to realize storage or release solar energy at constant temperature by phase transition, which can effectively overcome the instability of solar irradiation in time and space. In this paper, paraffin was selected as phase change matrix, meanwhile, the thermal conductivity enhancement (expanded graphite) and photothermal conversion reinforcement (carbon black nanoparticles) were respectively added by secondary vacuum penetration to prepare paraffin/expanded graphite/carbon black phase change materials for direct photothermal conversion. As a result, the extremely low thermal conductivity and poor spectrum absorption capacity of paraffin are greatly improved by expanded graphite and carbon black nanoparticles respectively on the basis of retaining the excellent phase transformation properties of paraffin. When the content of carbon black nanoparticles is 10 wt%, the isotropic thermal conductivity of the prepared material in solid phase and phase transformation respectively reach 10.54 W/mK and 20.53 W/mK, which increased by 31.94 times and 96.76 times when compared with pure paraffin. Meanwhile, the corresponding intrinsic photothermal conversion efficiency and effective thermal storage efficiency are up to 60.1% and 97.3%, respectively.

Abstract: Passivating contacts based on doped polysilicon (poly-Si) and ultrathin silicon oxide offer outstanding surface passivation and low contact resistance. The passivation quality of poly-Si contacts can be further improved by hydrogenating the oxide interface, often achieved via thermal annealing with hydrogen-containing dielectric coatings such as silicon nitride (SiNx) or aluminium oxide (AlOx). In this work, we present an alternative method using magnesium fluoride (MgFx) coatings to improve the recombination properties of doped poly-Si layers. It is found that MgFx coatings can yield comparable benefits as AlOx and SiNx on n-type poly-Si, enhance the passivation effect of SiNx on p-type poly-Si when used as an additional capping layer, and facilitate the recovery of firing-induced-degradation in n-type poly-Si. Besides improving passivation, MgFx exhibits some inherent advantages over other dielectric films in that it is more conductive and has a low work function. Utilising these properties, we have demonstrated the use of 10 nm thick MgFx films as an interlayer to improve contact formation between n-type poly-Si and evaporated aluminium, achieving a contact resistivity of 1.6mΩ∙cm2 while preserving the passivation. Our results highlight a possible pathway to use MgFx to simultaneously improve the passivation and metallisation of doped poly-Si contacts in industrial production.

Abstract: The large (∼600 kDa) endocytosis receptor megalin/low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 is highly expressed at the apical membrane of proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs). Megalin plays an important role in the endocytosis of various ligands via interactions with intracellular adaptor proteins, which mediate the trafficking of megalin in PTECs. Megalin mediates the retrieval of essential substances, including carrier-bound vitamins and elements, and impairment of the endocytic process may result in the loss of those substances. In addition, megalin reabsorbs nephrotoxic substances such as antimicrobial (colistin, vancomycin, and gentamicin) or anticancer (cisplatin) drugs and advanced glycation end product-modified or fatty acid-containing albumin. The megalin-mediated uptake of these nephrotoxic ligands causes metabolic overload in PTECs and leads to kidney injury. Blockade or suppression of the megalin-mediated endocytosis of nephrotoxic substances may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for drug-induced nephrotoxicity or metabolic kidney disease. Megalin reabsorbs urinary biomarker proteins such as albumin, α1-microglobulin, β2-microglobulin, and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein; thus, the above-mentioned megalin-targeted therapy may have an effect on the urinary excretion of these biomarkers. We have previously established a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure the ectodomain (A-megalin) and full-length (C-megalin) forms of urinary megalin using monoclonal antibodies against the amino- and carboxyl-terminals of megalin, respectively, and reported their clinical usefulness. In addition, there have been reports of patients with novel pathological anti-brush border autoantibodies targeting megalin in the kidney. Even with these breakthroughs in the characterization of megalin, a large number of issues remain to be addressed in future research.

Abstract: Polycrystalline silicon on silicon oxide (poly-Si/SiOx) passivating contacts can be used for ultra-high-efficiency interdigitated back contact (IBC) monocrystalline silicon solar cells. We evaluate the use of intrinsic poly-Si for the region that isolates the p- and n-type fingers at the back side of IBC devices. To mitigate shunt across the isolation region between the doped p- and n-type fingers, we demonstrate self-aligned subtractive processing by etching the poly-Si in the isolation region using SF6 plasma followed by etching in a tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution. After removal of the poly-Si, the isolation region was passivated with SiNx and Al2O3, which resulted in an 11.7% increase in the fill factor in a 19.8% efficient device. Furthermore, we evaluate the limitations of this device through Suns-Voc analysis and simulations using SunSolve and Quokka3 solar cell simulation software. Through Quokka3, we show that the most significant efficiency losses come from junction recombination current (J02) in the isolation region between doped fingers. We predict that the cell efficiency can be most improved with reduced J02 through better isolation of heavily doped fingers by etching the isolation region deeper into the bulk or through enhanced surface chemical passivation in this region.

Optical coupling of nano silicon on the surface of solar cells was a valuable technology conducive to large-scale use, and the controlled optical properties of silicon nanofilms could better enhance the light absorption of solar cells. In this paper, we demonstrated that the efficiency of monocrystalline silicon solar cells could be effectively improved by spin-coating a nano silicon solution on the solar cell surface. The maximum value of absolute efficiency improvement was 0.23%. Moreover, this gain was shown to come from the additional absorption of light by the silicon nanofilms. The surface optical properties of the silicon nanofilms applied to the solar cell surface and the electrical properties of the solar cell were calculated by transmission matrix method (TMM) calculations and simulations with the Silvaco TCAD. It provided accurate predictions and explanations for the preparation of silicon nanofilms.

Abstract: In this work, the impact of Li and K co-doping on the properties of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) monograin powders used as absorber materials in monograin layer (MGL) solar cells was investigated. CZTS powders were grown in the liquid phase of flux materials with different LiI-KI ratios by synthesis-growth method. According to Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy, the amount of K in the host material did not depend on the molar ratio of LiI to KI in the flux mixtures and remined constant at 0.01 at%. However, the Li concentration depended on the initial amount of LiI in the LiI-KI flux mixture and increased from 0.01 at% to 1.22 at% in the synthesized CZTS. X-ray diffraction, Raman analysis and photoluminescence (PL) analysis confirmed that Li content x = 0.2 and x = 0.4 in the input composition of (Cu1-xLix)1.84Zn1.09Sn0.99S4 resulted in formation of solid solution. The external quantum efficiency measurements showed that the effective bandgap energy of CZTS increased from 1.52 eV to 1.57 eV by increasing the Li content in CZTS from x = 0–0.02 to x = 0.4, respectively. The mean values of VOC of the corresponding monograin layer solar cells increased from 700 to 742 mV. The highest VOC of 784 mV was obtained with device based on solid solution containing 1.22 at% of Li (x = 0.4). The best performing solar cell with power conversion efficiency of 9.4% was obtained with Li and K co-doped CZTS powder (x = 0.002) showing output parameters: VOC = 718 mV, JSC = 20.9 mA/cm2 and FF = 62.5%.

Abstract: The conductive polymer polyaniline (PANI) has attracted much attention in the field of electrochromic energy storage device (EESD) due to its rich color changes and good pseudocapacitive properties, however, the operating voltage window and cycling stability of PANI material, as an essential part in the full electrochromic devices, has failed to be fully explored and employed. Herein, we synthesized the PANI and MnO2 nanocomposite structure via robust one-step electrodeposition approach, forming an intriguing architecture similar to the coral-like nano-porous. The rougher coral-like structure provides a great quantity nano porous ion transport channel, which greatly improves the working voltage range and cycling stability of the electrode, and shows great potential as an anode electrode for EESDs. In addition, we built a complementary full EESD prepared with tungsten oxide (WO3) as the counter electrode, which has both electrochromic and energy storage dual function integration, allowing real-time observation of the EESD operating state based on color change. It can work stably under a large voltage window of -2V–1.5V, with good bistable performance, fast response speed and more than 1000 times electrochemical cycle life. This work provides a new opportunity to design next-generation high-performance and intelligent hybrid energy storage system for consumer electronics.

Abstract: Thermochemical energy storage (TCS) was considered as a promising candidate for renewable energy utilization and energy efficient utilization. Particularly, metal oxide-based TCS has attracted increasing attention due to its operation possibility with air. In this work, CuO-doped cobalt oxide composite was prepared by a simple mechanical mixing process and explored for TCS application. The influences of CuO doping on the redox behavior, repeatability and the optical absorption property of cobalt oxide were investigated. Doping with CuO significantly decreased the onset temperature of reduction by 60 °C compared to pure cobalt oxide. Meanwhile, the result verifies that the onset temperature of re-oxidation could be tuned in the range from 825 to 890 °C by altering the doping amount of CuO. The reason for the tunable onset temperature was examined from the viewpoint of the structural transformation of the composite during the reduction/re-oxidation process. It was presumed that the doping amount of Cu species in CoO might relate to the onset temperature of re-oxidation. The repeatability of the composite was highly affected by the doping amount of CuO. Moreover, CuO with relatively small particle size exhibited a positive effect on improving the repeatability of CuO-doped cobalt oxide composite. Additionally, the absorption spectra demonstrate that CuO doping would affect the optical absorption property of the composite, enhancing the absorption of visible light. Hence, the results obtained in this work indicate that doping with CuO could be a promising method to extend the applicability of cobalt oxide-based system for TCS application.

Abstract: Hormone receptor-positive breast cancer is the most common subtype of breast cancer. The protein phosphatase PP1A gene is described as an oncogene in several tumor types; however, the biological function of PP1A in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer remains unclear. The Cancer Genome Atlas data indicates PP1A expression is upregulated in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer tissues than in normal breast tissues. We explored the biological function of PP1A in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer using MTT assays, colony formation assays, and a xenograft mouse model. The results indicated that PP1A promoted hormone receptor-positive breast cancer proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC02754 recruited the binding of the transcription factor E2F1 to the PP1A promotor, thereby increasing PP1A expression. The PP1A then interacted with and dephosphorylated YAP1, resulting in YAP1 activation. The dephosphorylated YAP1 moved to the nucleus and increased the expression of the downstream oncogene CTGF, promoting hormone receptor-positive breast cancer progression. Our findings reveal the function of the LINC02754/E2F1/PP1A/YAP1 axis in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and provide new insight into hormone receptor-positive breast cancer progression.

Abstract: Carbon-based, all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable interests because of their superior environmental stability, simple and low-cost fabrication process. However, the large energy barrier and high defect states at the CsPbBr3/Carbon interface will cause poor carrier extraction and serious carrier recombination, which further degrade performance of final devices. In this work, we introduce zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs), and ZnPc mixed CsPbBr3 QDs in proper proportion as the CsPbBr3/carbon interface modification layers of CsPbBr3 PSCs. It is found that the modification layers, especially the ZnPc mixed CsPbBr3 QDs modification layer, can passivate trap states, improve interface contact and optimize energy level alignment at the CsPbBr3/carbon interface, which can further enhance carrier extraction, suppress carrier recombination and improve performance of final devices. By virtue of ZnPc mixed CsPbBr3 QDs modification, a highest efficiency of 10.20% and long-term stability over 6 months has been achieved.

Abstract: This study assesses and improves the accuracy of commonly used expressions for the fill factor (FF). Parameters that could affect the accuracy of the revised expressions are investigated. Empirical coefficients of the commonly used analytical expressions are first recalculated using a modified fitting approach. Although the predictions of the revised expressions perfectly match the results of theoretical one-diode model simulations, gaps are observed when compared with actual measurements. The different impacts of unaccounted factors in the expressions are then explored. It is shown that adjusting the ideality factor or considering edge recombination improves the accuracy of the predictions. Moreover, the expressions can slightly overestimate the FF of cells with non-uniform implied open-circuit voltage distribution. As methods to extract electrical parameters from luminescence images continuously improve, the findings of this study can aid in developing techniques for extracting FF from luminescence images of industrial solar cells.

Abstract: This paper investigates the dispersion stability and thermophysical characteristics of water-based alumina (Al2O3), graphene oxide (GO) and their hybrid nanofluids (HNF) at different mixing ratios. Initially, the sol-gel and Hummer's method was employed for the synthesis of Al2O3 and GO nanoparticles (NPs) and they were characterized with X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–visible) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The effect of three different surfactants was analyzed on the stability of nanofluids (NFs). The properties such as thermal conductivity (TC) and viscosity (VST) were measured at different volume concentrations and temperatures ranging from 0.1 to 1 vol% and 30–60 °C, respectively. The maximum TC enhancement of GO is 43.9% higher than Al2O3 NF at 1 vol% at a temperature of 60 °C. The addition of GO content increases the TC and VST of HNF. The regression equations were developed to forecast the VST and TC of HNFs. Finally, two modern novel machine learning approaches, a Bayesian optimized support vector machine and a wide neural network, were used to model-predict the thermophysical properties of HNFs with a robust prognostic efficiency of 97.15–99.91%.

Abstract: CsPbCl3 perovskite is considered as an ideal light absorber for ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors in virtue of its suitable wide bandgap and salient optoelectronic property. Nevertheless, the detection performance of the reported self-powered CsPbCl3 UV photodetectors is far from satisfactory since it still remains challenging to fabricate high-quality CsPbCl3 polycrystalline films with low trap-state density. Herein, a novel cadmium (Cd)-doping strategy is demonstrated by an evaporation method to manipulate the optical, electrical and morphological property of the CsPbCl3 polycrystalline film for the first time. The incorporation of Cd2+ ions into CsPbCl3 lattice can effectively improve the crystallinity, grain sizes and UV harvesting capability of the CsPbCl3 perovskite, while the defect state of the film gets pronouncedly suppressed. Thus, the overall performance of the charge-transport-layer-free Cd-doped CsPbCl3 photodetectors attains an obvious enhancement. A thin MnS modification layer is further introduced to ameliorate the interfacial charge transport dynamics between the CsPbCl3 and carbon layers. It is found that the MnS buffer layer can effectively reduce the interfacial barrier and accelerate the hole injection process, yielding a lower interfacial charge accumulation and recombination. The best-performing MnS-modified device achieves an ultra-high current on/off ratio of 3.97 × 105 and a high specific detectivity of 5.47 × 1012 Jones at 0 V bias. This comprehensive performance is comparable to that of any other CsPbCl3 photodetectors. Besides, the as-prepared CsPbCl3 photodetectors possess superior operational and thermal stabilities. Our work opens up a new approach for the defect passivation of CsPbCl3 perovskite and highlights its great application potential in high-performance UV detection.

Abstract: Super cooling and phase separation seriously abate the safety level of hydrated salt for applying in thermal management of electrical power industry. A novel composite phase change material (PCMs) was prepared based on assembling boron nitride-chitosan (BNCA) porous structure with Lyophilization and embedded sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT). Disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate (DHPD) and Gum arabic powder (GA) were applied as nucleating agent and thickener, respectively. Furthermore, FTIR, XRD, TGA, Hot Disk, DSC, T-history method were used to character the samples and 100 times thermal cycles were introduced to assess the shape stability. The results showed that BNCA/SDG composite PCMs has been prepared successfully. The supercooling of samples was adjusted by adding DHPD. And it can drop to minimum (1.17 °C), when 4% DHPD was added in SAT. As for melting enthalpy, can be adjusted by adding GA in SAT. And when GA was 5%, the melting enthalpy was 253.43 J/g and supercooling drop to 4.95 °C. Adopting BNCA as SAT carrier can further suppress the supercooling (Tsc = 2.54 °C) and improved the thermal conductivity (1.00 W/(m·K)) of composite PCMs. After 100 freezing-melting cycles test, the thermal properties of BNCA/SDG composite PCMs nearly didn't change, the latent heat reduced from 193.17 to 191.23 J/g. The modified SAT adsorbed by BNCA, showing stable chemical, crystalline, and microstructure which provided guarantee for long-term operation of heat storage materials. The BNCA/SDG composite PCMs with high thermal conductivity and thermal storage density have a great potential application in electrical power systems.

Abstract: The PARP1 protein plays a key role in DNA damage repair and ADP-ribosylation to regulate gene expression. Strategies to target PARP1 have rapidly been developed for cancer treatment. However, the role of the innate immune response in targeted anti-PARP1 therapy remains poorly understood. In this work, we aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism underlying the immunogenicity of PARP1 and explore efficient therapeutic strategies to enhance the antitumor effect of PARP inhibitors. The relationships between PARP1 expression and immunosuppressive factors were examined by qRTPCR and immunoblot analysis. DNA pull-down, chromatin immunoprecipitation–quantitative PCR (ChIPqPCR) and luciferase reporter assays were employed to reveal the mechanism by which the expression of the immune checkpoint regulator CD24 is regulated by PARP1. Phagocytosis assays and pancreatic cancer animal models were applied to evaluate the therapeutic effect of simultaneous disruption of PARP1 and the antiphagocytic factor CD24. Upregulation of the innate immunosuppressive factor CD24 was observed in pancreatic cancer during PARP1 inhibition. The activating effect of targeting CD24 on macrophage phagocytosis was verified. Then, we showed that PARP1 attenuated the transcription of CD24 by ADP-ribosylating the transcription factor DDX5 in pancreatic cancer. Combined blockade of PARP1 and the antiphagocytic factor CD24 elicited a synergetic antitumor effect in pancreatic cancer. Our research provided evidence that combination treatment with PARP inhibitors and CD24 blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be an effective strategy to improve the clinical therapeutic response in pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Whereas the growth of PV installations is well under way in highly developed countries mainly by installing highly efficient monocrystalline silicon modules in larger and larger PV installations, the progress of electrification especially in cities as well as in poor countries providing access to electricity grids stays far behind the targets agreed on when accepting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Still more than 40% of the world population (3 billion people) have no possibility to use clean fuels and technologies for clean cooking. Low cost decentralized and flexible PV may provide a fast solution allowing also to harvest solar energy from building facades and on rooftops in densely populated regions as well as on tents or provisional shelters if needed. Here the monograin technology offers a versatile solution allowing for very low-cost local printing of very high quality single crystalline earth abundant solar powders as well as complete recycling of valuable materials in a circular economy. We here report the latest progress of this technology based on Kesterite materials. The outline of a completely vacuum-free printing process for the solar cell powder as well as for all contact materials will be shown, currently being set up as a prototype in our lab. As has been demonstrated already for most of the process steps, also commercially available printing lines as used in screen printing e.g., for traffic signs can directly be used. The design for a circular (cradle-to-cradle) economy makes it the currently only PV technology fully sustainable with very low material losses and energy input. The main commercial advantage is the possibility to produce already in relatively small scale (MWp/a) for very low costs, so that this technology is especially suitable also for developing countries interested in decentralized power production in remote areas.

Will SiOx-pinholes for SiOx/poly-Si passivating contact enhance the passivation quality?,

Abstract: Passivating contacts based on poly-Si have enabled record-high c-Si solar cell efficiencies due to their excellent surface passivation quality and carrier selectivity. The eventual existence of pinholes within the ultra-thin SiOx layer is one of the key factors for carrier collection, beside the tunneling mechanism. However, pinholes are usually believed to have negative impact on the passivation quality of poly-Si passivating contacts. This work studied the influence of the pinhole density on the passivation quality of ion-implanted poly-Si passivating contacts by decoupling the pinhole generation from the dopants diffusion process by means of two annealing steps: (1) a pre-annealing step at high temperature after the intrinsic poly-Si deposition to visualize the formation of pinholes and (2) a post-annealing step for dopants activation/diffusion after ion-implantation. The pinhole density is quantified in the range of 1✕106 to 3✕108 cm2 by the TMAH selective etching approach. The passivation quality is discussed with respect to the pinhole density and the post-annealing thermal budget (TB) for dopants diffusion. The study shows that a moderate pinhole density does not induce doping profile variations that can be detectable by the coarse spatial resolution of ECV measurements. It is surprising that the existence of pinholes in a moderate density within our thickness fixed SiOx layer can effectively enhance the passivation qualities for both n+ and p+ poly-Si passivating contacts. We speculate the reason is due to the enhanced field-effect passivation at the pinhole surrounding. In fact, the variation of the passivation quality depends on the balance between a strengthened field-effect passivation and an excessive local Auger recombination, being both effects induced by the higher and deeper level of dopants diffused into the c-Si surface through the pinholes.

Abstract: This study reports the effective preparation of macro-encapsulated Cu–Ge alloy PCMs (Cu-20Ge, Cu-40Ge and Cu-60Ge) for high-temperature thermal energy storage. The uniformly mixed Cu and Ge powders are spherulitized into millimeter/centimeter-sized balls, after which the core balls are coated with Al2O3 shells. The Cu–Ge@Al2O3 macrocapsule with a cavity between the shell and core is successfully prepared after a two-step sintering process. The cavity formed by the pores and gaps among the powders can provide buffer spaces to support the volume expansion of the PCM during temperature increase and phase transition. The Cu–Ge alloy phase is synthesized in situ from Cu and Ge powders during the high-temperature sintering process. The melting-solidification cycling test demonstrates an excellent durability of the Cu–Ge capsules. The heat storage capacity of the capsules can be optimized by isostatic pressing to minimize excess cavities, and by adding sintering aids including MgO and SiO2 in the Al2O3 shells to increase the shell strength for achieving larger capsules with thinner shells. The macrocapsules present high heat storage density, especially for the Cu-40Ge capsules with a size of 9 mm@1 mm-100MPa, which show high values of 211 J/g and 719 MJ/m3 at a temperature region between 600 and 700 °C. The Cu-40Ge alloy is more suitable for high temperature thermal storage due to its better phase change properties and thermal cyclic durability.

Abstract: Secretoglobin (SCGB) 3A2 is a bioactive molecule exhibiting various functions such as improving allergic airway inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis and promoting bronchial branching and proliferation during lung development. To determine if and how SCGB3A2 is involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a multifactorial disease with both airway and emphysematous lesions, a COPD mouse model was created by exposing Scgb3a2-deficient (KO), Scgb3a2-lung-specific overexpressing (TG), and wild type (WT) mice to cigarette smoke (CS) for 6 months. The KO mice showed loss of lung structure under control condition, and CS exposure resulted in more expansion of airspace and destruction of alveolar wall than WT mouse lungs. In contrast, TG mouse lungs showed no significant changes after CS exposure. SCGB3A2 increased the expression and phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)1 and STAT3, and the expression of α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) in mouse lung fibroblast-derived MLg cells and mouse lung epithelial-derived MLE-15 cells. In MLg cells, A1AT expression was decreased in Stat3-knockdown cells, and increased upon Stat3 overexpression. STAT3 formed a homodimer when cells were stimulated with SCGB3A2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assays demonstrated that STAT3 binds to specific binding sites on the Serpina1a gene encoding A1AT and upregulates its transcription in lung tissues of mice. Furthermore, nuclear localization of phosphorylated STAT3 upon SCGB3A2 stimulation was detected by immunocytochemistry. These findings demonstrate that SCGB3A2 protects the lungs from the development of CS-induced emphysema by regulating A1AT expression through STAT3 signaling.

The functional LGA was then used as supporting matrix to fabricate novel form-stable phase change materials (PCMs). The microstructure, thermal performance and multi-energy driven properties of the form-stable PCMs are investigated and results present that both the LGA and form-stable PCMs are flexible. DSC tests indicate that the encapsulation efficiency of LGA to PCM is calculated about 90 wt%. The form-stable PCMs show a superior thermal reliability after 200 thermal cycling. Based on the excellent electro/photo-thermal conversion of LGA, the form-stable PCMs also reveal outstanding photo-sensitive flexibility under a simulated light source, which can convert 73.5% of electric energy into heat energy at low driving voltage of 8 V. Moreover, the form-stable PCMs enable to transform the photo energy into thermal energy, with the maximum conversion effectivity of 91.8%. The form-stable PCMs effectively also extend the output voltage time of the thermoelectric generator coupled with the novel thermal energy storage. Therefore, the form-stable PCMs with multi-energy conversion functions will have extensive application prospects in the energy storage system and thermal management fields.

Abstract: Green, stable, and high-performance phase change materials with photothermal/electrothermal capabilities are crucial for solar thermal utilization. In this paper, biomass cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), konjac glucomannan (KGM), MXene (a two-dimensional material), and AgNO3 were first mixed through a simple and fast physical process and then subject to directional freeze-drying and thermal annealing successively. The resulting lightweight porous carbon aerogels further adsorbed paraffin to yield a composite phase change material PMCKA. PMCKA had a high loading rate (95.16%), high enthalpy (231.38 J/g), exceptional conductivity (147.5 S/m), and remarkable cycle stability. Moreover, the photothermal and electrothermal conversion efficiencies of PMCKA might reach up to 97.45% and 98.89%, respectively. This finding demonstrates superior photothermal and electrothermal conversion performance of PMCKA in solar energy storage. Therefore, PMCKA can probably be widely applied to solar thermal conversion, industrial waste heat recovery, and thermal management of electronic equipment.

Abstract: This study was to explore the hydrophilic surfactant/Brij L4 mixture scheme for fabrication of highly stable paraffinic nano-emulsions melting at 55 °C by the low-energy phase inversion temperature method that has not been reported previously. Two commercial paraffin waxes were chosen as the PCM agents, Sasolwax 5203 with a higher onset Tm of 54 °C in the initial development and OP44E with a lower onset Tm of 44 °C for further assessment and fabrication. At accelerated stability testing by thermal approach, the rate of droplet size increase was mainly attributed to Ostwald ripening destabilization mechanism, and decreased by about 5 times for every 5 °C drop. Only a moderate increase in the particle size was observed, from 47.7 nm to 120.6 nm, over a period of 9 months at 45 °C. The exciting results in the accelerated stability evaluation greatly outperformed than those previous results only obtained from the regular stability testing including room temperature storage and heating-cooling cycles in a container, and hence this experimental result can offer a more meaningful reference in terms of service life of nano-emulsions flowing in pipelines. With the optimized surfactant mixtures, a series of highly stable paraffinic nano-emulsions in the working temperature range of 30–50 °C were successfully formulated as promising coolants in the active thermal management system.

Abstract: One of the features of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that make them stand out among all photovoltaics (PVs) is their high open-circuit voltage (VOC). Owing to their simple manufacturing process, low cost of components, and good stability, carbon electrode-based metal-halide PSCs are gaining interest for their better stability and low cost than noble metal electrodes. However, carbon electrode-based hybrid PSCs suffer low open-circuit voltage (VOC). This work demonstrated the fabrication of ambient processed hybrid perovskite solar cells using low-temperature curable carbon-based electrodes without a hole transport layer. The devices exhibit an impressive high open circuit voltage of 1.07 V, even without a dedicated hole transport layer. The photovoltaic performance was further investigated with the same perovskite absorber, synthesized by solution-processed and solid-state synthesis routes. The latter have yielded better short circuit current and power conversion efficiency due to perovskite's lesser built-in trap density. Furthermore, using a combined ionic electronic carrier transport model, an electric double-layer formation was ensured across the perovskite/carbon interface and accumulating halide vacancies at the perovskite/TiO2 interface can effectively reduce carrier recombination and boost the device's VOC. This study envisages the impact of the electric double layer in free carrier transport of an ionic-electronic semiconductor like hybrid perovskites and can pave the way to improve the open-circuit voltage of carbon-based perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: Antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) has attracted much attention as a photovoltaic absorber material with tunable bandgap, low structural complexity, and high absorption coefficient. As one-dimensional ribbon material, the uncontrollable (h k 0) orientation of the Sb2S3 film will affect the carrier transport, controlling the orientation growth of the film is an effective strategy to improve the short-circuit current density. In this work, the large-grained Sb2S3 films with (h k 1) preferred orientation were fabricated by pulsed electrodeposition and post-sulfurization, and the effects of deposition charges on film properties and device efficiency were investigated. A champion photoelectric conversion efficiency of 3.35% was obtained. And a new perspective for effectively controlling thin film growth orientation and fabricating low-cost solar cells was provided.

Abstract: Phosphorus-doped Czochralski-grown silicon (Cz-Si) has been gaining market share in the large-scale manufacturing of high-efficiency silicon (Si)-based photovoltaic (PV) devices thanks to higher carrier lifetimes than their boron-doped counterpart. However, the fabrication of n-type Cz-Si based solar cells often requires process steps with much higher temperatures and longer times than p-type Silicon. Defect interaction with the high temperatures during such processes tend to be detrimental to the n-type Cz-Si carrier lifetime, therefore limiting the final device efficiency. Short thermal anneals before cell processing, known as Tabula Rasa (TR), have been proposed to mitigate the thermally induced lifetime degradation during n-type Cz-Si solar cell fabrication. This work thoroughly investigates the defects responsible for the lifetime degradation after TR in a N2 atmosphere treatment. We use temperature-injection-dependent lifetime spectroscopy and the thickness variation method to decouple the effects of TR treatment in the bulk and the surface of the n-type Cz-Si wafers. Using the defect parameter contour mapping (DPCM), we identify the defect energy level (Et) and the capture cross-section ratio (k) of the most likely process-induced defect, which aligns with previously proposed Si vacancy-associated defects. The DPCM reveals that these vacancy-associated defects have a shallow energy level Et − Ev ∼0.13 eV and very efficient electron capture cross section k∼600. Unexpectedly, the bulk degradation due to vacancy defects in the volume of the wafer, is accompanied by a significant increase in the surface recombination as well. Through evaluating the surface recombination velocity temperature- and injection dependence, we show that after TR, at room temperature and for an injection level of 1015 cm−3, in a wafer passivated with a-Si:H(i) the surface recombination dominates the overall lifetime response. We hypothesize that the near surface vacancy-associated bulk defects play a role in lowering the electron diffusion current into the a-Si:H(i) from the c-Si(n) reducing the field-effect passivation.

Abstract: A hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) system combines photovoltaic (PV) and photo-thermal (PT) energy collection into a single structure, enhancing the potential to achieve greater solar energy conversion efficiencies. Such enhanced efficiencies can result in greater economic returns and could promote a larger uptake of PVT devices in cold and temperate climate countries. Through the utilization of a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model, this work provides new insights into the optical, electrical, and thermal characteristics of PVT devices. In particular, the work focuses on evaluating the behaviour of novel luminescent imidazole-phenanthroline-based working fluids that were previously experimentally investigated as liquid spectral beam splitters (SBS). The modelling procedure outlined here is able of providing an in-depth analysis of various categories of photons undergoing events such as transmission, absorption, parasitic absorption, and luminescent downshifting (LDS) which, otherwise, are difficult or impossible to detect experimentally. Evaluating such photon characteristics provides the possibility to estimate the direct contribution of the luminophore (embedded within the working fluid) to the enhanced conversion efficiencies reported for PVT systems. In addition, the model can also allow for better tuning of the luminophore properties to match the main factors that are influencing the energy conversion dynamics of these systems. The current results indicate that the embedded luminophore is able of providing direct contributions of up to 91% for thermal power generation and 77% towards electrical power generation for the various concentrations of the liquid filters when compared with the individual performances of the independent PV or PT systems.

Abstract: Direct particle receiver of the concentrated solar power (CSP) with a supercritical CO2 (sCO2) Brayton cycle is based on the solid particles to achieve high efficiency at high temperature. Among all kinds of solid particles, desert sand is abundant and cheap, however its solar weighted absorptance and thermal stability remain to be improved. In this work, the dark desert sands were obtained by in-situ coating transition metal oxides via sol-gel combustion process. The thermal stability of the resultant samples was analyzed according to the changes in composition, morphology and optical properties before and after thermal treatment at 800 °C for 200 h. Based on the characterization of UV–Vis–NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, the solar weighted absorptance of each sample was calculated. Compared with the original particles, all of dark desert sands have the improved solar weighted absorptance, and the highest value of 0.8635 belongs to desert sand coated with spinel CuMn2O4. Moreover, compared to the original desert sand, each dark desert sand has superior thermal stability. In addition, the specific heat of particles was measured at different temperatures, and it is found that the coating has lesser effects on the specific heat of desert sand. The solar weighted absorptance of dark desert sand nearly unchanged after attrition and the coating remained well maintained on the surface of the sample. This work provides a practical and feasible way to enhance the solar weighted absorptance and thermal stability of desert sand, making it possible to apply in sCO2 CSP.

Abstract: Solar photovoltaic system is one of the growing renewable energy sources in the energy market. The performance of the PV system is mainly affected by the partial shading which is inevitable. It creates mismatch losses between the PV rows that reduce the power generation. Many research works proposed solutions like Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and static & dynamic reconfiguration methods. These methods can enhance the power conversion rate of the PV system. However, this power conversion rate can be enhanced by the proposed mismatch loss mitigation algorithm. A current compensation converter has been developed to operate the PV system with even current generating rows. The PV row currents have been measured by using the current sensor and fed to the controller. The controller performs the algorithm and generates the triggering signals to the DIDO converter and it operates the PV rows with even current generation. The performance of the proposed system has been simulated under five kinds of shading patterns using the MATLAB/Simulink® and the corresponding PV curves were plotted. This work is also validated using the 200Watts PV system, which is constructed with the four polycrystalline PV modules as a 2 × 2 PV array. The performance of the proposed system with the corresponding results and waveforms are presented in this work.

Abstract: The extraordinary structural stability of Dion Jacobson (DJ) phase two-dimensional (2D) perovskites, which are created by integrating diammonium cation spacers into the organic-inorganic perovskite structure with a uniformly ordered configuration, has piqued the interest of scientists. In this study, a solution of diammonium cation spacer based on 1,4-Phenylenediammonium iodide (PDAI) in IPA is spin-coated on top of 3D triple cation (Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3) perovskite films toward a 2D-3D mixed-structure. The 2D topping layer based on DJ phase passivated surface imperfections, reduced charge recombination at contact surfaces, and boosted the optoelectronic characteristics of the formed 2D-3D perovskite materials, which are attributed to the hydrogen bonding interaction of NH3+ and (PbI6)- octahedra. The PCE of the perovskite device has been remarkably enhanced from 19.77 to 21.15%, and the PDA-treated perovskite presented better stability studies than the untreated. Moreover, this improved environmental resistance and gradient energy levels at connection interfaces aided hole injection from the 3D perovskite to Spiro-OMeTAD, while inhibiting electrons from recombining with holes. It is essential to mention that the significant improvement in PCE came from Voc and FF. The improved device efficiency was attributed mainly to further effective inhibition of unwanted non-radiative recombination as well as the resulting decreased recombination centers.

Abstract: We demonstrate the beneficial effect of a pre-annealing step prior to the boron diffusion on passivation and contact resistivity of industrially LPCVD deposited poly-Si/SiOX hole-selective contacts. We investigate the influence of the pre-annealing temperature on passivation quality, measured as implied open-circuit voltage and recombination current density, and on changes in crystallinity, characterized by Raman spectroscopy. A clear increase in passivation quality is observed on planar and textured surfaces as well as for various poly-Si thicknesses (100–230 nm) and thermal SiOX growth temperatures (600–800 °C). On planar surfaces and without the use of atomic hydrogenation, we report an increase in iVOC of around 5 mV with every additional increase of pre-annealing temperature by 50 °C (>900 °C) leading to an iVOC of 720 mV (J0 = 9.3 fA/cm2). After atomic hydrogenation, the effect of the pre-annealing is less pronounced. Nevertheless a gain in iVOC (reduction in J0) of 5–10 mV (2–5 fA/cm2) is achieved when comparing samples without pre-annealing with samples after a pre-annealing at 1050 °C. On textured surfaces on the other hand, this trend is more pronounced after atomic hydrogenation, for which a pre-crystallisation at 1050 °C leads to an iVOC (J0) of 705 mV (16.8 fA/cm2), which is a gain (reduction) of 24 mV (21.7 fA/cm2) compared to samples without a pre-annealing step.

Abstract: Multi-layer crystallization and uncontrollable defects were the main factors that limiting the quality of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) films. Here a hybrid crystallization strategy was proposed to simultaneously improve the morphology and defect properties of CZTSSe film. Firstly, we found the variation of the microstructures (constitution, chemical environment of the elements, etc.) in precursor films can greatly alter the grain-growths of CZTSSe films. Detailed characterizations revealed that the chemical environment of S in the precursor film may influence the S-to-Se substitution of the film during the selenization process. This can further affect the grain-growth mechanism and the properties of CZTSSe film. While the S-to-Se substitution of the film mainly occurred below 500°C, the NaSex on the surface of the film could dominate the grain-growth (Na-mechanism). For this mechanism, the CZTSSe film exhibited bi-layer morphology and relatively high band-tail energy, but shallow-acceptor was detected in the film. The solar cells based on the CZTSSe films reached the efficiency of 10.6%. As a comparison, liquid phase could be generated when the S-to-Se substitution of the film shifted to higher temperature (>500°C). In this condition, the grain-growth would be dominated by the liquid phase (LP-mechanism). Such mechanism can eliminate the multi-layer crystallization and reduce the band-tail energy, but the surface properties of the CZTSSe film was deteriorated and the formation of shallow-acceptor in CZTSSe was inhibited. The fabricated solar cells achieved the efficiency of 10.3%. Based on the results above, a bi-layer precursor film contained sub-layers with different microstructures was proposed to regulate the crystallization of CZTSSe. The co-existence of different microstructures in the precursor film could induce a hybrid grain-growth mechanism for the CZTSSe film (e.g., the Na-mechanism worked on the surface while the LP-mechanism worked in the bottom simultaneously). Such grain-growth mechanism can yield CZTSSe film with uniform morphology and favorable defect properties. The CZTSSe solar cells based on the hybrid grain-growth mechanism achieved the best efficiency of 12.6%. The investigation in this paper would provide new solutions for the crystallization regulation on CZTSSe photovoltaic material.

Abstract: In this work, we developed a type of shape-stabilized phase change materials (SSPCMs) based on carbonized melamine foam/graphene aerogel (CMGA) as a supporting material and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a phase change material. PEG@CMGA SSPCMs were prepared by fabricating a series of CMGA double skeleton with different carbonization temperatures using freeze-drying and high-temperature carbonization, followed by vacuum impregnation of PEG into the CMGA double skeleton. The morphological structure, thermal storage property, shape stability, thermal conductivity, and solar/electric conversion behavior of the fabricated SSPCMs are investigated. The results showed that PEG@CMGA SSPCMs exhibited excellent shape stability, high latent thermal storage capacity of 181.2 J/g, thermal cycling stability, enhanced thermal conductivity with 387% higher than that of pure PEG, solar-to-thermal energy conversion capability with high efficiency of 91.7% and electric-to-thermal energy conversion capability with high efficiency of 87.3%. The results of this work provide a strategy for the design and development of high performance, multiple energy conversion forms of SSPCMs for promising applications in solar energy utilization, energy-efficient buildings, and heat preservation.

Abstract: The utilization of solar steam generator via photothermal conversion is a sustainable and highly sufficient solution for addressing long-standing water scarcity. Due to its extensive optical absorption, dopamine has been considered as a promising photo-thermal conversion material. In this work, by co-depositing Fe3+ and 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (KH550) with polydopamine (PDA), a high-performance, low-cost, and scalable modified membrane (called PVDF/PDA@KH550@Fe3+) with superior oil resistance was developed. Under one sun illumination, the resulting PVDF/PDA@KH550@Fe3+ membrane generated solar steam with a high efficiency of 90.33% and a high evaporation rate of 1.40 kg m−2 h−1. More importantly, the evaporation rate still performs well even in oil-contaminated water due to the improvement of hydrophilicity and anti-fouling capabilities of the modified membrane. In oil-in-water emulsion, the evaporation rate approaches 1.33 kg m−2 h−1 and the evaporation efficiency reaches 85.49%. This study demonstrated that solar steam generation using PVDF/PDA@KH550@Fe3+ membrane could be a viable option for seawater and oily wastewater purification.

Abstract: In this work, finite element modelling was used to investigate the stress evolution in solar photovoltaic modules after soldering and lamination. The impact of cell overlapping in modules and the selection of solders on maximum stress and stress distribution of Multi Busbar modules was investigated. Simulation results predict that the maximum 1st principal stress of up to ∼230 MPa in Si cells occurred at the edge of outer Ag pads. In addition, highly localised stress area occurred at the overlapped area when tiled which was verified by Raman spectroscopy. The application of SnBi solder can effectively reduce the maximum 1st principal stress in the tiled module from more than 220 MPa to ∼160 MPa, though its material properties tend to result in higher stress in the interconnection with a cell gap than SnPb solder.

Abstract: Background
The prevalence of age-associated erectile dysfunction (ED) increases pronouncedly with age. However, the cellular composition and transcriptomic changes of aging penile corpus cavernosum remain largely unclear.
Methods
Herein, we performed single cell sequencing penile corpus cavernosum from five young with normal erectile response and five old rats with ED.
Results
Clustering analysis identified 19 cell types, such as fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and immune cells. We next revealed their transcriptomic alterations and investigated novel subpopulations of major cell types. Among them, fibroblasts possessed the largest cell number and showed apparent heterogeneity. By performing single-cell entropy analysis on fibroblasts, we observed the age-associated decrease of entropy, and aged fibroblasts were found to adopt senescent secretory phenotype, as evidenced by the high expression of genes associated with the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Finally, we constructed a comprehensive intercellular communication network and highlighted key mediators of crosstalk between fibroblasts and other cell types.
Conclusions
We plotted a cellular atlas of aging cells within penile corpus cavernosum, especially fibroblasts. Our work will deepen the understanding of the heterogeneity among certain cell types within aged penile corpus cavernosum, which will generate positive effects on the future treatment of age-associated ED.

Abstract: This work focused on a novel shape-stable phase change composites (SSPCMs) for thermal energy storage. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)/wood flour (WF) composites were selected as latent heat storage medium, and polylactic acid (PLA) was selected as the matrix. The research on PEG/WF composites (WP) shown that PEG can be easily encapsulated by WF as a result of capillary force. After incorporating with PLA, the PEG/WF/PLA ternary composites (WPCs) still displayed high latent heat (87.2 J/g). What worthy focused was that PLA endowed with WP some powerful performance, such as remarkable mechanical strength in different temperature and excellent reprocessability. Moreover, there were only intermolecular force between three components. The superior thermal reliability and chemical stability were evidently confirmed by the thermal cycling test and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The whole preparation process without any chemical crosslinking agent and organic solvent was satisfied with environment friendly. A broad application value is embodied in solar thermal energy storage and biomass energy thanks to easy synthesis of PEG/WF/PLA composites.

Abstract: The development of high-efficiency photoelectrodes at low manufacturing cost is of great interest for the production of renewable and green hydrogen through solar-driven water splitting. In this work, we use structural, optical, and photoelectrochemical characterizations to study the performance of unprotected epitaxial GaAs/Si photoelectrodes during photocorrosion. More specifically, we demonstrate that photoanodes including 1-μm thick GaAs epitaxially grown thin film on a low-cost Si substrate can produce a higher photocurrent than those measured for expensive commercial GaAs wafers. Based on photoelectrochemical experiments under monochromatic excitation, we show that the improved photocurrent has to be related to the dual-bandgap operation of the GaAs/Si photoelectrode, benefiting from both GaAs and Si photo-generated carriers. This result opens new possibilities to further design efficient and low-cost dual-bandgap photoelectrodes.

Abstract: We report the effect of anti-reflection SiO2 coatings on the performance of luminous transmittance (Tlum) and solar modulation ability (ΔTsol) of VO2-based thermochromic smart windows. VO2 films with different thicknesses of 60, 90, and 120 nm were deposited on ZnO-buffered glasses by an RF magnetron sputtering with substrate biasing. Through the simulations, we found that SiO2 film with a low refractive index (n ∼ 1.5) would be effective for anti-reflection on VO2/ZnO/glass layered structure. As the results, the highest ΔTsol of 17.7% was achieved in the 120 nm-VO2 with 174 nm-SiO2 coating. On the other hand, the highest Tlum of 52.5% was achieved in the 60 nm-VO2 with 85 nm-SiO2 coating. The 90 nm-VO2 with 85 nm-SiO2 coating realized balanced values of Tlum and ΔTsol of 44.2 and 11.6%, simultaneously. The achieved Tlum and ΔTsol are comparable to the highest values reported for VO2-based smart windows suggesting that the SiO2 coatings are quite effective for anti-reflection on VO2/ZnO/glass structure. Depth profiles of atomic concentrations by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), proved sharp SiO2/VO2 interface without inter-diffusion, while certain diffusion of Zn into VO2 layer, suggesting the necessity of further low-temperature processing for VO2 deposition. This study suggests a route for realizing the further improvement of VO2-based smart windows as practical applications.

Abstract: Although Bcl-xL has been shown to retrotranslocate Bax from mitochondria to cytosol, other studies have found that Bcl-xL also stabilizes the mitochondrial localization of Bax. It is still unclear what causes the difference in Bcl-xL-regulated Bax localization. Bad, a BH3-only protein with a high affinity for Bcl-xL, may play an important role in Bcl-xL-regulated Bax shuttling. Here, we found that Bcl-xL enhanced both translocalization and retrotranslocation of mitochondrial Bax, as evidenced by quantitative co-localization, western blots and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) analyses. Notably, Bad knockdown prevented Bcl-xL-mediated Bax retrotranslocation, indicating Bad was essential for this process. Quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in living cells and co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that the interaction of Bcl-xL with Bad was stronger than that with Bax. The Bad mimetic ABT-737 dissociated Bax from Bcl-xL on isolated mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondrial Bax was directly liberated to cytosol due to Bad binding to Bcl-xL. In addition, MK-2206, an Akt inhibitor, decreased Bad phosphorylation while increasing cytosolic Bax proportion. Our data firmly demonstrate a notion that Bad binds to mitochondrial Bcl-xL to release Bax, resulting in retrotranslocation of Bax to cytosol, and that the amount of Bad involved is regulated by Akt signaling.

Abstract: Calcium oxide (CaO) is a very promising candidate energy storage material for concentrated solar power plants because of high energy storage density, high temperatures of energy release, and readily available precursors. However, CaO itself not only sinters severely at typical operating temperatures but also has low light absorption capacity. To overcome these challenges, modifying CaO with nanoparticle of magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) oxides was proposed in this work. The Mg and Mn co-modified sample (Ca:Mn:Mg = 9:1:1) demonstrates exceptional thermal stability at 800 °C, the density of energy storage deceases by about 1.1 and 0.7% after 10 and 25 cycles, respectively. Microstructure analysis reveals that MgO and Ca2MnO4 nanoparticles assemble into a net or chain that distributed in the CaO or CaCO3 particles, which effectively suppresses sintering and provides stable channels for CO2 to diffuse in CaO or CaCO3 layer. After 60 cycles, the density of energy storage declines by 7.46%. Additionally, introducing manganese both makes O atoms have more electrons and creates more oxygen vacancies that favor CO2 activation. The synergistic effect between Mn and Mg achieves high stability, fast calcination reaction and high conversion rate of the energy storage material. The presence of Mn also greatly improves the solar absorption capacity of CaO material, and the co-modified sample exhibits much higher solar absorptance after long-term testing. The proposed CaMnMg911 material could be applied in a concentrated solar power plant for solar energy storage.

Abstract: WO3·2H2O film with porous structure was grown on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass by a simple constant current electrodeposition (CCE). The as-grown WO3·2H2O film shows a loose and porous structure, which is formed by the accumulation of large size nanoparticles. For comparison, amorphous WO3·xH2O film was prepared by constant voltage electrodeposition (CVE). Both the films prepared by CCE and CVE are hydrated oxides instead of simple oxides, which is proved by thermal analysis. A large optical modulation of 86.3% at 550 nm and a high coloration efficiency of 178.8 cm2 C−1 are achieved for the WO3·2H2O film. Additionally, the as-prepared film also shows a good cycling stability: the film exhibits an optical modulation of 75.6% after 500 cycles (retaining 87.6% of its initial optical modulation). Excellent electrochromic properties should be attributed to the porous structure of the WO3·2H2O film, which brings more electrochemical active sites for insertion and extraction of ions.

Abstract: Quasi-1D chalcogenides have shown great promises in the development of emerging photovoltaic technologies. However, most quasi-1D semiconductors other than Sb2Se3 and Sb2S3 have been seldom investigated for energy generation applications. Indeed, cationic or anionic alloying strategies allow changing the bandgap of these materials, opening the door to the development of an extended range of chalcogenides with tuneable optical and electrical properties. In this work, Bi incorporation into the Sb2Se3 structure has been proved as an effective approach to modulate the bandgap between <1.0 eV and 1.3 eV, demonstrating conversion efficiencies between 3 and 5% for 0.01 < x ≤ 0.10. However, there is a noticeable deterioration in optoelectronic parameters for x > 0.1. In order to better understand the underlying mechanisms leading to the formation of (Sb1-xBix)2Se3, and thus design specific strategies to enhance its properties, thin films with different annealing time and temperature have been synthesized and characterized. Interestingly, it has been observed that Sb2Se3 and Bi2Se3 are formed first, with Bi melting at 300 °C and diffusing rapidly towards the surface of the film. At higher temperature, the binary compounds combine to form the solid solution, however as the dwell time increases, (Sb1-xBix)2Se3 decomposes again into Bi2Se3 and Sb. This study has shown that the material is essentially limited by compositional disorder and recombination via defects. Likewise, routes have been proposed to improve morphology and uniformity of the layer, achieving efficiencies higher than 1% for x > 0.2.

Abstract: To ensure of the fabrication crystalline Si (c-Si) solar cells at affordable costs, research has been actively conducted on the use of Cu-based pastes as alternatives to their Ag counterparts, which are currently being used as front electrode materials. However, only limited studies have reported on the use of Cu pastes in processes involving high-temperature firing, primarily owing to the issues caused by Cu oxidization and the resulting products acting as deep-level impurities. In this study, the applicability and limitations of Cu-based pastes containing Cu–Ag core–shell particles as the front electrodes of Si solar cells were investigated. A double printing structure with a seed layer of Ag paste was adopted to prevent direct contact between Si and Cu. By analyzing the morphological and electrical properties, the O-mediated electrode-formation mechanism of the Cu-based paste during high-temperature firing under ambient air conditions was evaluated and compared with that of the conventional Ag paste. The electrical parameters of c-Si solar cells were found to always deteriorate when the Cu paste was used, regardless of the electrode structure, owing to the reduction of Cu involved in Ag crystallite formation. Moreover, only contact formation under inert ambient conditions presented electrical parameters similar to those for commercial Ag paste when using high-temperature firing. Finally, the limitations of applying a front electrode paste primarily containing Cu were assessed.

Abstract: The c-Myc oncoprotein plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. The deregulated expression of c-Myc has been linked to a variety of human cancers including lung adenocarcinoma. The oncogenic function of c-Myc has been largely attributed to its intrinsic nature as a transcription factor. Here we reported the RNA binding protein hnRNPAB as a direct transcriptional target of c-Myc by performing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and luciferase reporter analyses. Flow cytometry, colony formation, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were used to investigate the role of hnRNPAB in lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation, as well as the underlying mechanism. HnRNPAB was functionally shown to promote lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation by accelerating G1/S cell cycle progression. Mechanistically, hnRNPAB interacted with and stabilized CDK4 mRNA, thereby increasing CDK4 expression. Moreover, hnRNPAB was able to promote G1/S cell cycle progression and cell proliferation via the regulation of CDK4. HnRNPAB was also revealed as a mediator of the promoting effect of c-Myc on cell proliferation. Together, these findings demonstrate that hnRNPAB is an important regulator of lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation. They also add new insights into the mechanisms of how c-Myc promotes tumorigenesis.

Abstract: The increase in the manufacturing of copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) thin film photovoltaics is accompanied by a growing amount of production waste, which contains a mixture of valuable, critical and hazardous elements. However, industrial recovery and reuse processes of these elements for production of new photovoltaics are still absent. In this paper, the possibility of using benign leaching conditions for recovering mainly silver and indium from production waste flexible CIGS solar cells was investigated, along with the contamination levels from other industrial elements in the leachate. At the same time, the prospect of selective leaching of contaminants was assessed, aiming to purer streams of the valuable metals and thus their reuse in new products. The results show an increase in the leaching yields of Ag and In when acid concentration and surface to liquid ratio (A:L) increase, however, this is also true for contamination. A complete Ag recovery and 85% recovery of In was achieved with 2 M HNO3 and A:L equal to 1:3 cm2/ml after 24 h of leaching at room temperature. Under the same conditions, leaching with 0.5 M HNO3 extracts 85% Ag and 30% In, with correspondingly reduced contamination levels. Finally, leaching with 0.1 M HNO3 proved to be promising for achievement of higher Ag purity through an initial step of Zn selective leaching for 1 h.

Abstract: Lead-free glass has been widely used in the electronic paste industry due to the environmental requirements. As a glass modifier, TeO2 has attracted the attention of researchers. Herein, the effect of Te on the wettability of lead-free glass frit and its correlation with the silver grid was studied by modifying Te on the surface of glass frit. The modified Te and the Bi precipitated from the surface of glass frit formed Bi4TeO8, which promoted the silver melting while improved the wettability of lead-free glass frit to silicon wafer. The continuous wetting behavior of glass frit during melting process was studied by establishing data model in MATLAB. The influence of wettability of glass frit on the densification of silver electrode and the contact formation between it and silicon wafer was discussed. The results indicated that the welding tension of silver grid was significantly improved by the dense silver electrode and excellent contact property. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of glass frit were changed by the modification of Te and its effect on the rheology of silver paste was investigated. As the specific surface area of the glass frit was varied in a suitable range, the viscosity and elastic behavior of silver paste were adjusted to enhance the printing performance for obtain the optimal aspect ratio.

Abstract: Monoubiquitinated lysine 119 of histone H2A (H2AK119ub) is a highly abundant epigenetic mark, associated with gene repression and deposited on chromatin by the polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1), which is an essential regulator of diverse transcriptional programs in mammalian development and tissue homeostasis. While multiple deubiquitinases (DUBs) with catalytic activity for H2AK119ub (H2A-DUBs) have been identified, we lack systematic analyses of their roles and cross-talk in transcriptional regulation. Here, we address H2A-DUB functions in epigenetic regulation of mammalian development and tissue maintenance by conducting a meta-analysis of 248 genomics datasets from 32 independent studies, focusing on the mouse model and covering embryonic stem cells (ESCs), hematopoietic, and immune cell lineages. This covers all the publicly available datasets that map genomic H2A-DUB binding and H2AK119ub distributions (ChIP-Seq), and all datasets assessing dysregulation in gene expression in the relevant H2A-DUB knockout models (RNA-Seq). Many accessory datasets for PRC1–2 and DUB-interacting proteins are also analyzed and interpreted, as well as further data assessing chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) and transcriptional activity (RNA-seq). We report co-localization in the binding of H2A-DUBs BAP1, USP16, and to a lesser extent others that is conserved across different cell-types, and also the enrichment of antagonistic PRC1–2 protein complexes at the same genomic locations. Such conserved sites enriched for the H2A-DUBs and PRC1–2 are proximal to transcriptionally active genes that engage in housekeeping cellular functions. Nevertheless, they exhibit H2AK119ub levels significantly above the genomic average that can undergo further increase with H2A-DUB knockout. This indicates a cooperation between H2A-DUBs and PRC1–2 in the modulation of housekeeping transcriptional programs, conserved across many cell types, likely operating through their antagonistic effects on H2AK119ub and the regulation of local H2AK119ub turnover. Our study further highlights existing knowledge gaps and discusses important directions for future work.

Abstract: Neuroinflammation is a common response in various neurological disorders. Mesenchymal stem cell-based treatment has become a promising therapy for neuroinflammation-associated diseases. However, the effects of mesenchymal stem cells are controversial, and the underlying mechanism is incompletely understood. In the present study, menstrual blood-derived endometrial stem cells were intravenously transplanted into a mouse model of neuroinflammation established by peripheral injection of lipopolysaccharide. Microglial cells challenged with lipopolysaccharide were cultured with conditioned medium from endometrial stem cells. The levels of cytokines were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell proliferation and death were detected by Cell Counting Kit 8 and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and caspase 1 (Casp1) were evaluated by western blotting. The results showed that intravenous transplantation of endometrial stem cells downregulated proinflammatory factors and upregulated anti-inflammatory factors in the brain of mice with neuroinflammation. Conditioned medium suppressed the inflammatory reaction and hyperactivation of microglial cells and protected microglial cells from cell death induced by lipopolysaccharide in vitro. The expression of TLR4, MyD88, NLRP3 and Casp1 in the brain of mice with neuroinflammation and in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglial cells was downregulated by endometrial stem cells and conditioned medium, respectively. These data suggested that menstrual blood-derived endometrial stem cells may suppress neuroinflammatory reactions partially by regulating microglia through the TLR4/MyD88/NLRP3/Casp1 signalling pathway. Our findings may be very useful for the development of an alternative stem cell-based therapy for neuroinflammation-associated disorders.

Abstract: The experimental study of the results of reflective aluminum foils, metal sheets, and phosphate granules on the productivity and efficiency of hemispherical solar stills was given throughout this work under the solar conditions of the city of El-Oued (Algeria). Solar stills were designed, manufactured, and tested in August 2020. A standard hemispherical solar still was made of wood and coated with black silicon. It was considered a traditional solar still. Although it was compared to traditional solar stills, it was improved by covering its side walls with reflective aluminum foil, zinc metal sheets, and copper sheets. It had been found that the productivity of the modified still was 8.67%, 29.08%, and 42.35%, respectively, on top of that of the traditional solar still. This could be due to the activity of the foils and metals, which reflect more radiation and store energy, increasing the temperature of the salt water in the basin. In the second experiment, three modified solar stills in line with aluminum foil and phosphate granules (30 g/L), zinc metal sheet and phosphate granules, and copper metal sheet and phosphate granules were collectively used. It had been found that the productivity of the modified solar still with aluminum foil and phosphate granules (the improvement rate is 30.61%) was on the far side of that with zinc metal sheets and phosphate granules (the improvement rate is 49.961%) and copper metal sheets and phosphate granules (the improvement rate is 62.24%).

Abstract: To find a more effective light trapping structure for silicon solar cells, a chain pyramid structure was obtained by using texturing additives under alkaline condition. Compared with the conventional random pyramid's reflectivity of 9.78%, the reflectivity of the chain pyramid is reduced to 8.54%, and the structure is more uniform. Optical simulation of chain pyramid shows that as the degree of overlap between the pyramids increases, the proportion of secondary reflection gradually decreases, transforming into higher order reflections. Compared with the PERC solar cells prepared with random pyramid, the Jsc of the cells prepared with the chain pyramid is increased by 0.25 mA/cm2, and the efficiency is increased by 0.15%. Subsequent EQE and reflectivity tests show that after the deposition of SiNx layer, the reflectivity advantage of the chain pyramid is mainly manifested in the short-wave range.

Abstract: Kesterite-based structures are being extensively studied for solar module productions due to their earth abundant and nontoxic nature, high absorption coefficient, and a wide variety of scalable deposition methods. Kesterites are mostly manufactured using thin-film technology. However, in the last decade, the monograin approach has gained further attention, providing a third alternative to mono-crystalline wafer and thin film methods. This is due to its high throughput, low-cost deposition techniques, flexibility, and light weight. Despite the technical advancements in the monograin technology, their environmental impacts have not been studied in the literature. This paper, for the first time, presents a cradle to gate environmental life cycle assessment of CZTS monograin module production. The analysis is designed to identify the environmental hotspots associated with materials, energy usage, and manufacturing processes. The results were compared to CZTS thin-film and the commercially available CIGS technologies. The analyses suggested that the front contact accounted for the majority of impact in all categories due to the use of silver. The normalisation results showed that the marine aquatic ecotoxicity impact category dominated the overall impact results. A comparison of CZTS monograin and thin film production demonstrated that monograin outperformed the thin film technology when silver was substituted with alternative materials and was proximate to CIGS even considering their higher achieved efficiency. The analysis presents considerable environmental benefits associated with the monograin technology. Further savings in emissions could be achieved with improved conversion efficiency and usage of renewable energy sources in the manufacturing stages.

Abstract: Titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles (NPs) look very promising for solar energy harvesting owing to a strong plasmonic absorption with the maximum in the near-infrared range. However, the synthesis of TiN nanofluids is very challenging as one has to combine the plasmonic feature and long-term colloidal stability to withstand harsh conditions of direct absorption solar collectors (DASC). Here, we explore solutions of bare (ligand free) TiN NPs synthesized by pulsed laser ablation in acetone as the nanofluid. We show that such NPs are low size-dispersed (mean size 25 nm) and exhibit a broad absorption peak around 700 nm, while their negative charge ensures a prolonged electrostatic stabilization of solutions. Solar weighted absorption coefficient of such TiN nanofluids reaches 95.7% at very low volume fractions (1.0 × 10−5), while nanofluid temperature can be increased up to 29 °C under 1.25-sun illumination. Our data evidence that the thermal efficiency of a DASC using TiN nanofluid is 80% higher compared to Au-based counterparts. The recorded high photothermal efficiency and excellent colloidal stability of TiN nanofluids promises a major advancement of DASC technology, while laser-ablative synthesis can offer easy scalability and relative cost-efficiency required for the implementation of systems for solar energy harvesting.

Abstract: It is of great value to create new bio based green energy-saving and temperature regulating materials under the background of carbon peak and carbon neutralization. In this study, balsa wood was prepared by delignification as encapsulation materials to combine with polyethylene glycol based phase change materials (PCMs) to make phase change energy storage wood (PCES-Wood). In order to improve the thermal conductivity of PCES-Wood, the carbon black grafted with octadecyl isocyanate(aCB)was impregnated into the wood to obtain a thermally enhanced phase change energy storage wood (aCB-PCES@Balsa). The results show that aCB exhibited superior dispersibility and formed thermal conduction pathways in the wood. When the aCB content is 4%, the degree of supercooling of aCB-PCES@Balsa is the smallest, and the melting enthalpy and solidification enthalpy reach 100.34 J/g and 91.10 J/g, respectively. The 4% aCB-PCES@Balsa also exhibits strong hydrophobicity and full-optical-segment absorption. Under the irradiation of a simulated solar light source, the surface temperature of 4% aCB-PCES@Balsa rises rapidly to 28 °C and exhibits long-lasting heat storage capacity at low temperatures. After 200 cycles of cooling and heating, the phase change energy storage wood still maintains a high phase change enthalpy value, indicating that the aCB-PCES@Balsa has a good durability. This study provides a new approach for green heat storage in biomass composites.

Abstract: Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) is an effective osteogenic factor and a promising candidate for bone tissue engineering. The osteoblastic potential of BMP9 needs to be further increased to overcome its shortcomings. However, the details of how BMP9 triggers osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are unclear. In this study, we used real-time PCR, western blot, histochemical staining, mouse ectopic bone formation model, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation to investigate the role of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells, as well as the underlying mechanism. We found that PDK4 was upregulated by BMP9 in C3H10T1/2 cells. BMP9-induced osteogenic markers and bone mass were increased by PDK4 overexpression, but decreased by PDK4 silencing. β-catenin protein level was increased by BMP9, which was enhanced by PDK overexpression and decreased by PDK4 silencing. BMP9-induced osteogenic markers were reduced by PDK4 silencing, which was almost reversed by β-catenin overexpression. PDK4 increased the BMP9-induced osteogenic markers, which was almost eliminated by β-catenin silencing. Sclerostin was mildly decreased by BMP9 or PDK4, and significantly decreased by combined BMP9 and PDK4. In contrast, sclerostin increased significantly when BMP9 was combined with PDK4 silencing. BMP9-induced p-SMAD1/5/9 was increased by PDK4 overexpression, but was reduced by PDK4 silencing. PDK4 interacts with p-SMAD1/5/9 and regulates the sclerostin promoter. These findings suggest that PDK4 can increase the osteogenic potential of BMP9 by enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling via the downregulation of sclerostin. PDK4 may be an effective target to strengthen BMP9-induced osteogenesis.

Abstract: The thermal energy storage technology based on phase change materials (PCMs) can solve the mismatch problem between thermal energy supply and demand, and improve energy utilization efficiency. However, the fluid leakage problem and low thermal conductivity of PCMs are not suitable for solar thermal storage application. The solar thermal collector combined with PCM seeks for the rapid storage of thermal energy and reduces the heat exchange with external environment, requiring PCM to possess specific directional thermal conduction. In this paper, inspired by the principle of directional transport of water in the cellulose channel of natural trees, the porous structure with anisotropic thermal conductivity is formed by carbonization of pine at 1000 °C. The CPCM with directional thermal conductivity is prepared by combining magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (MNH) with carbonized wood (CW). The axial thermal conductivity of the MNH/CW composite PCM (CPCM) is 1.86 times than that of the radial direction. The photo-thermal conversion efficiency of MNH/CW CPCM is 83%. This structure changes the direction of thermal energy transmission, and reduces the dissipation of thermal energy and the use of thermal insulation medium. This work provides an innovative idea for the design and manufacture of CPCM related to low and medium temperature solar thermal energy storage.

Abstract: The benefits of thermochemical heat storage include high-energy storage density, long storage time, and negligible heat loss during storage. Silica gel has recently been widely studied as a heat storage material. However, most of the research has focused on its heat storage performance in the reactor; the form of water inside silica gel and the specific heat storage mechanism remain to be clarified. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance to investigate changes in the internal water binding form and content of silica gel before and after water adsorption and determined the equation for the thermochemical reaction. We further investigated the effects of temperature and humidity on the adsorbability of silica gel. The theoretical heat-storage density of silica gel was 1029.63 kJ/kg. Kinetic analyses of desorption gave an activation energy of 66.75 kJ/mol, suggesting that the most probable mechanism function is a 3D diffusion model. The diffusion of water vapor in micropores is the limiting step for the reaction. Silica gel is highly competitive with other thermochemical heat-storage materials, considering the heat-storage density, reaction difficulty, and cycling performance.

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase exacerbates mitochondrial calcium uniporter-related mitochondrial calcium overload by phosphorylating α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease,

Abstract: α-Synuclein phosphorylation and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis are important mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease, but the network regulating these mechanisms remains unclear. We identified the role of key phosphokinases and the pathological effects of α-synuclein phosphorylation on mitochondrial calcium influx and mitochondrial function in Parkinson’s disease. The function of the key phosphokinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase, was investigated through loss- and gain-of-function experiments using a cell model of Parkinson’s disease. The regulation of mitochondrial calcium uniporter-mediated mitochondrial calcium influx by calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase was explored using a cellular model of Parkinson’s disease. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments and α-synuclein mutation were used to explore the mechanism through which calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase regulates mitochondrial calcium uniporter-mediated mitochondrial calcium influx and exacerbates mitochondrial damage in Parkinson’s disease. Here, we show the pathogenic role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase in Parkinson’s disease progression. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase phosphorylated α-synuclein to activate mitochondrial calcium uniporter and thus increase mitochondrial calcium influx, and these effects were blocked by α-synuclein S129A mutant expression. Furthermore, the calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase inhibitor CASK-IN-1 exerted neuroprotective effects in Parkinson’s disease. Collectively, our results suggest that calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase phosphorylates α-synuclein to activate the mitochondrial calcium uniporter and thereby causes mitochondrial calcium overload and mitochondrial damage in Parkinson’s disease. We elucidated a new role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase in Parkinson’s disease and revealed the potential therapeutic value of targeting calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase in Parkinson’s disease treatment.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) represent a promising emerging photovoltaic technology, though its commercialization could be limited by toxicity of lead halides used as absorber materials. Lead replacement with other less toxic elements is actively discussed and intensively investigated in many research laboratories over the world. However, the comparative study of the toxicity/hazard effects induced by different metal halides (Pb, Sn, Bi), as well as organic counterparts of perovskites (i.e., methylammonium or formamidinium halides) is still missing. Herein, we present the first systematic in vitro and in vivo study of the acute toxicity effects of a panel of the precursors commonly applied in the fabrication of PSCs. Surprisingly, we found that bio-effects of methylammonium iodide (MAI) are similar to that of lead iodide (PbI2) in in vitro models. Furthermore, tin iodide (SnI2) is just about ten times less toxic than PbI2 which makes questionable its potential use as “eco-friendly” material. In vivo experiments demonstrated that MAI and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are three times more toxic than PbI2 in terms of the lethal dose 50% (LD50). Thus, the presented here results show that the high acute toxicity effects of organic halides were largely overlooked by the community in the shadow of the actively discussed lead toxicity. Still, the potential mass application of PSCs is not expected to cause significant environmental impact or health hazard in comparison with other sources of lead pollution associated with the common use of lead-acid batteries, lead-containing pigments, fuel additives, roofing and electronics soldering materials, lead glassware and even tobacco smoke.

Abstract: Viologen-based materials have been widely explored for various practical applications, including smart windows, information tags, energy storage, and solar conversion devices, owing to their easy color adjustment, excellent electrochemical stability, and simple synthesis route. Herein, a series of pyrrole-based viologen derivatives with narrower bandgaps between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) than their parent viologen, BnV are synthesized and systematically investigated. The influence of the substituent at N-benzyl on the electronic and electrochromic properties of resulting materials are thoroughly studied. The electrochromic devices containing these newly developed derivatives exhibit vivid color change (transparent to magenta), high optical contrast (up to 93%), and a long lifetime (10,000s without current attenuation). Additionally, the extension of the π system endows these compounds with unanticipated electro-fluorochromic behavior, which holds great potential for encryption-related applications. This study demonstrates the feasibility of tuning the color, electrochemical features and obtaining bifunctional devices by modifying bipyridines with pyrrole moiety and different electronegative substituents. We anticipate that our findings will stimulate further interest in exploring new viologen-based derivatives towards next-generation electrochromic-fluorescent devices.
