Abstract: Tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells incorporate doped polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin films to promote charge carrier selectivity and supress recombination, and thus enable very high efficiency. So far, most of TOPCon cells only adopt poly-Si at rear side applications due to its absorptive natures. In this work, we have developed suitable n+ and p+ poly-Si layers via low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and tube diffusion for ex-situ doping. With proper process integration, the fabricated double-side poly-Si solar cells consist of ~20 nm n+ poly-Si grown at front textured surface and ~150 nm p+ poly-Si at rear planar surface. An excellent implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) of 725 mV with a total J0 value of 16.3 fA/cm2 were obtained on cell precursors capped and hydrogenated by SiNx. We also demonstrated solar cell fabrication and metallisation via industry-viable screen printing, which eliminates the use of transparent conductive oxide (TCO). The phosphosilicate glass (PSG) is found as the key point that determines the firing stabilities. The champion cell implemented with fire-through contacts shows a proof-of-concept efficiency of 19.6% over an area of 196 cm2, which is comparable with the reference cell metallised with the help of a tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) layer.

Abstract: In order to push silicon solar cell efficiencies further towards their limit, as well as to ensure accuracy of luminescence based characterization techniques, an accurate modeling of radiative recombination is important. It is well-known that the radiative recombination coefficient Brad of silicon shows a substantial charge carrier density dependence (c-dependence), often modelled via the scaling factor Brel quantified by Altermatt et al. Another effect lowering the total radiative recombination is photon recycling (PR), which depends mainly on the width and optical properties of the sample. PR also depends on free-carrier absorption (FCA), which introduces a further c-dependence. This work comprehensively reassesses and quantifies those influences on radiative recombination in silicon for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Firstly, it is evidenced that Altermatt's Brel model is dominated by the effect of band-gap narrowing (BGN). This clarifies that it should not be combined with a different BGN model to avoid modeling inconsistencies. It is thereby further confirmed that the band-to-band absorption coefficient of silicon does not show a relevant c-dependence for PV conditions. Next, a PR model is suggested which calculates a scaling factor Brel,PR. The model is proven useful in improving the interpretation of very high lifetime measurements. Finally, it is found that the c-dependence introduced by FCA affects the direct proportionality between luminescence signal and radiative recombination beyond charge carrier densities of 1016 cm−3 for samples thicker than typical wafer widths, and should then be considered in characterization techniques like e.g. calibrated lifetime measurements via photoluminescence.

Abstract: Refractory high entropy alloys have recently attracted widespread attention due to their outstanding mechanical properties at elevated temperatures, making them appealing for concentrating solar power and nuclear energy applications. However, their molten salt corrosion behavior has not been reported, which is critical in evaluating their application merit. Here, the corrosion behavior of two recently developed refractory high entropy alloys, namely TaTiVWZr and HfTaTiVZr, was studied in molten 33NaCl–22KCl–45MgCl2 (wt. %) eutectic salt at 450 °C and 650 °C, using potentiodynamic polarization technique. The results were compared with benchmark alloys, namely 304 stainless steel (SS304) and Inconel 718 (IN718). TaTiVWZr refractory high entropy alloy exhibited an order of magnitude lower corrosion current density (Icorr = 0.7× 10-3 A cm-2) compared to SS304 (Icorr = 9.2 × 10-3 A cm-2) at the higher temperature of 650 °C. The corrosion rate of all the alloys increased with increase in temperature from 450 °C to 650 °C with the exception of TaTiVWZr. The TaTiVWZr alloy showed a corrosion rate of ~ 5 mm/year at 650 °C compared to ~ 110 mm/year for SS304. HfTaTiVZr and IN718 showed comparable corrosion rates in the range of ~ 40 mm/year at 650 °C. The high corrosion resistance of the two refractory high entropy alloys was attributed to a combination of three factors: (i) slower chlorination rate of refractory elements in the molten chloride salt environment driven by thermodynamics, (ii) formation of stable Ta–V and Ta–V–W based complex oxides on their surface, and (iii) Ti/TiCl2 and Zr/ZrCl2 redox couple formation which retarded the depletion of refractory elements. In contrast, the Cr-, Fe-, and Ni-based surface passivation oxides for SS304 and IN718 were less protective in the molten salt environment, particularly at the higher temperature of 650 °C.

Abstract: The combination of thermal energy storage (TES) unit and solar air heater is one of the most efficient methods for long-term utilization of solar energy. In this study, a series of stable SrCl2@SG composite sorbents were prepared based on silica gel (SG) pellets and strontium chloride hexahydrate (SrCl2·6H2O) to store low-grade solar thermal energy for space heating application. Composite characteristics, kinetic hydration/dehydration performance of SG and SrCl2@SG sorbents were thoroughly studied. Results demonstrated that the SrCl2@SG_10 sorbent has the largest sorption capacity of 0.34 g/g at the temperature of 25 °C and relative humidity (RH) of 90% without any liquid leakage. Additionally, kinetic hydration experiments showed that RH has a great impact on the water sorption performance of the TES materials, while the temperature effect is relatively insignificant. The TES performance of sorbents was further investigated in a laboratory prototype reactor with a multilayer structure, which was designed following an open sorption system concept. 800 g of sorbent pellets were evenly distributed on each layer of the sieve. Maximum instant output power and energy storage density of the SrCl2@SG_10 sorbent at 70% RH are 19.7 W and 100 kWh/m3 respectively. Furthermore, the open TES system still maintains a comparatively high TES performance after fifteen charging/discharging cycles.

Abstract: Molten chloride salt is recognized as a promising heat transfer and storage medium in concentrating solar power (CSP) in recent years, but there is a serious lack for thermal property data of molten chloride salts under high-temperature condition. In this work, temperature and component dependence of local structure and physical properties for binary KCl–MgCl2 mixture were computed by molecular dynamics simulations (MD) method based on Born–Mayer–Huggins (BMH) potential. As the temperature rises, the distances between ions change and the structures turn into loose state, thus the density, thermal conductivity and the shear viscosity decrease, which also agree well with the experimental results. The calculation errors of thermal properties are mainly within 8%. The results show that density and thermal conductivity have negative linear correlation with temperature. Specific heat capacity is invariant with temperature at a constant pressure. When K+ increases in the salt, thermal conductivity is significantly improved, and shear viscosity and specific heat capacity decrease. The formulas of temperature-thermal properties-component correlations are obtained, which provide the fundamental property database for the precise design of high-temperature thermal storage system.

Abstract: The sub-bandgap photoluminescence (PL) arising from dislocations in crystalline silicon (known as “D-lines”) has been studied for over half a century. However, many properties of the D-lines such as the defect parameters and the underlying recombination mechanism are poorly understood. In this study, we perform both temperature-dependent and injection-dependent hyperspectral mapping and apply this to a cast-mono silicon sample held at room-temperature and above. We parameterize the energy levels and defect densities of the D-lines in this sample. We also demonstrate for the first time that the D1 line in silicon wafers originates from the donor–acceptor pair recombination mechanism.

Abstract: Though Li-doping/alloying has powerful effects on tailoring the band-gap and altering grain boundaries of the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorbers to achieve an enhanced CZTSSe device performance, a simple and effective method is meaningful for overcoming the surviving drawbacks of massive Li losses in in-situ doping processes of adding lithium salt in precursor solution. Herein, we demonstrate an effective approach to significant increase the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and efficiency of the CZTSSe solar cells by simply coating a LiOH layer on the air-processed Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) precursor film before selenization. It is found that the VOC could be adjusted by altering the coated LiOH concentration, and a 412 mV VOC could be obtained for 1 mg/mL LiOH, which is 30 mV higher than that of non-treated CZTSSe solar cells, and a 1.43 times higher efficiency of 7.8% is achieved. Characterizations prove that such LiOH coating approach can make Li enter the CZTSSe absorber and has the trend of locally accumulated at the grain boundaries, promote the crystallinity, lower the optical band-gap, improve the carrier mobility and decrease the transfer resistance, thus leading to the enhanced short-circuit current and fill factor for high device efficiencies. This study might imply a new kind of potential method for element doping and thus improving the CZTSSe device performance.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the potential curative modality for poor-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML), relapse remains the main reason for transplant failure. Early-phase studies showed azacitidine is safe for post-transplant maintenance therapy in AML.
Methods
We performed a single institutional prospective cohort study to evaluate the benefit of azacitidine maintenance therapy following allogeneic HSCT in poor-risk AML. The main objective of this study is to generate a hypothesis aiming to optimize post-transplantation outcomes in poor-risk AML. Forty-nine adults with poor-risk AML who underwent allogeneic HSCT were evaluated in a nonrandomized prospective cohort fashion. Thirty-one participants received post-transplant azacitidine (32 mg/m2) on Days 1–5 for a 28-day treatment cycle beginning approximately 40 days after transplantation. The study was controlled using 18 matched individuals who were on a noninterventional surveillance protocol.
Results
The relapse rate was significantly higher in the control cohort (66.67%) versus (25.81%) in the azacitidine maintenance cohort (p < .005). Time to relapse was significantly prolonged by azacitidine maintenance, not reached versus 4.1 months in the control arm (p < .0001). In addition, median overall survival was lower in the control cohort at 7.6 versus 27.4 months in the interventional cohort (p < .0001). At a median follow-up of 24 months, incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) did not differ between study groups (p = .325). In both cohorts, minimal residual disease was correlated with higher hazard of relapse (95% confidence interval, 2.31–13.74; p < .001).
Conclusion
We conclude that low dose azacitidine maintenance following allogeneic HSCT in poor-risk AML, decreased relapse rate, and increased both the time to relapse and overall survival without increased risk of GVHD.

Abstract: The NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is responsible for the sensation of various pathogenic and non-pathogenic damage signals and has a vital role in neuroinflammation and neural diseases. Various stimuli, such as microbial infection, misfolded protein aggregates, and aberrant deposition of proteins can induce NLRP3 inflammasome in neural cells. Once triggered, the NLRP3 inflammasome leads to the activation of caspase-1, which in turn activates inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β and interleukin -18, and induces pyroptotic cell death. Mitochondria are critically involved in diverse cellular processes and are involved in regulating cellular redox status, calcium levels, inflammasome activation, and cell death. Mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid, and other mitochondria-associated proteins and lipids play vital roles in the instigation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, the processes of mitochondrial dynamics, such as fission and fusion, are essential in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and their imbalance also promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In this connection, mitophagy-mediated maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis restricts NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation and its consequences in various neurological disorders. Hence, mitophagy can be exploited as a potential strategy to target damaged mitochondria induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its lethal consequences. Therefore, the identification of novel mitophagy modulators has promising therapeutic potential for NLRP3 inflammasome-associated neuronal diseases.

Abstract: Organic solar cells are ideal for semi-transparent applications given their “peaky” absorption, which allows them to selectively absorb photons outside the visible range while transmitting visible light. Such devices embody a fundamental tradeoff between transparency and power generation that must be optimized to fit the requirements of each potential application—for example, powering electrically dimmable smart windows. To inform the design of organic ultraviolet-absorbers and solar cells that target such applications, we computer-generate sets of optical constants with a range of absorption coefficients and absorption cutoff wavelengths that mimic those of real organic semiconductors. We then perform optical transfer-matrix simulations to determine the absorption and transmission spectra of full-stack photovoltaic cells, inserting these computer-generated optical constants to describe the photoactive absorbing layers. We find that solar cells having absorbers with a cutoff wavelength of 420 nm produce the most power without degrading transparency or color neutrality, and that absorption coefficients up to 5 × 105 cm−1 are needed to fully absorb the targeted wavelengths within practical photoactive layer thicknesses <300 nm in the absence of a reflecting electrode.

Abstract: The formation and mechanism that drive corrosion in stainless steel as a containment material in the presence of phase change materials is of importance in solar thermal energy storage systems. In our work, half-immersed stainless steel 316 tokens in a carbonate-based phase change material (PCM 638) have been investigated. The samples were thermally cycled in air and Nitrogen environment up to 500 times within a high-temperature range, allowing the PCM to transform between solid and liquid states repeatedly. As a consequence of thermal cycling, severe thickness loss on steel token was observed, indicating a degree of oxidation occurring, which depleted the uncorroded steel. Cross-sectional microstructural analysis was carried out to determine the elemental distribution and structural morphology along the corrosion layers. This study shows that thermal cycling of SS 316 in PCM results in active Ni and Cr migration to the surface, leading to a significant depletion of Cr from steel moving into the PCM. Cr and Fe on the surface are found to oxidise with varying degrees, with respect to the exposure time. The depletion of Cr was found to be higher in SS 316 immersed in PCM, while also increasing with exposure time.

Abstract: Alumina–mullite particles are used in high-temperature solar thermal applications such as solar particle receivers. In this study, optical properties of alumina–mullite materials with variable content of alumina and mullite are determined in the spectral range of 0.193–1.69 μm. Variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry is performed for alumina–mullite thin films, which are fabricated by magnetron sputtering. The thin films are characterised by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy methods. The B-spline model is employed to generate ellipsometric parameters to fit the measured data and to obtain the optical properties. The investigated materials of variable content of alumina and mullite have a similar refractive index in the considered spectral range. The absorptive index of the alumina–mullite materials in the spectral range of 0.193–0.4 μm is higher than in the range 0.4–1.69 μm. The absorptive index decreases with increasing content of alumina in the spectral range of 0.193–0.4 μm. The material composed of similar proportions of alumina and mullite yields the highest absorptive index in the spectral range of 0.4–1.1 μm. The optical properties determined for the alumina–mullite materials are applied to obtain the radiative properties of spherical homogeneous particles. Mie theory is used to calculate absorption and scattering efficiency factors, as well as the scattering phase function. In addition, the scattering phase functions are obtained using the Henyey–Greenstein approximation and the transport approximation. The Monte Carlo ray-tracing method is employed to study the radiative transfer in a model one-dimensional particle curtain containing polydisperse particles exposed to high-flux solar irradiation. It is found that the overall reflectance, absorptance and transmittance of the particles only weakly depend on the optical properties of the materials investigated.

Abstract: The bifacial p-type silicon (p-Si) passivated emitter and rear cells (PERCs) have dominated the industrial bifacial solar cells. In this paper, we have investigated the impact of hydrogenated amorphous silicon oxynitride (SiOxNy) films on the optical and electrical performance of bifacial p-Si PERCs. Simulation and characterization are carried out to show the improvement of bifacial p-Si PERCs, yielding an absolute front-side efficiency improvement of 0.14% and 016% with SiOxNy films introduced to the front-side and rear-side, respectively. When SiOxNy films are employed to both sides of bifacial p-Si PERCs, the front-side and rear-side efficiency separately increase by 0.27% and 0.26% compared to the baseline without SiOxNy films. We have achieved on the bifacial p-Si PERCs production line an averaged front-side efficiency of 23.23% (champion efficiency of 23.42%), together with a 17.31% averaged rear-side efficiency. Furthermore, the introduction of SiOxNy films has been demonstrated to reduce the rear-side potential induced degradation (PID) effect through both single-cell modules and commercial glass-glass modules, due to the SiOxNy films protecting AlOx from corrosion and maximizing the field-effect passivation of AlOx layers.

Abstract: Hydrogenation of poly-Si based passivating contacts (TOPCon) is an essential process to achieve a very high level of surface passivation, especially on textured surface. This contribution is dedicated to improve the understanding of the hydrogenation mechanism. We compare different hydrogen sources with regard to their ability to chemically passivate defects at the Si/SiOx interface and presumably in the doped poly-Si layer as well as their thermal stability in a low and high temperature range. To this end, hotplate annealing series were performed on textured n-type TOPCon structures and Al2O3/SiNx multi-layer stacks were exposed to fast-firing processes. Very distinct activation characteristics were detected. It was also observed that the Al2O3 capping layers enable a higher level of surface passivation and higher thermal stability compared to SiNx. When implemented in multi-layer stacks, Al2O3 acts as a hydrogen diffusion barrier und prevents effusion from the TOPCon structure that deteriorates the passivation quality irreversibly.

Abstract: Glass frits play an essential role in the front silver paste of solar cells. In this study, we prepared a new type of graphene-doped glass frit by hydrothermal reaction. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) indicates that the doped glass frit has a smaller particle size and a larger surface area, which promotes front contact metallization. Appropriate contact angles and high-temperature microscopy (HSM) result in excellent wettability, a wide sintering window and etching effects. Graphene-doped multicrystalline silicon solar cells have better photoelectric conversion efficiency (19.10%) that is 0.6% higher than solar cells using traditional glass frits. Through characterization, we further found a large amount of conductive alloy and Ag at the interface, which facilitates electron flow. Therefore, an excellent ohmic contact is formed between the electrode and the n+ emitter, which reduces the contact resistance of the solar cell. This research has prospective guiding significance for the development of new high wettability glass frits for commercial multicrystalline silicon solar cells in the future.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, which accounts for most dementia cases. Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognised for its roles in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis which, in part, links amyloid-beta to neuronal death. Neuroinflammatory signalling can be exhibited by neurons themselves, potentially leading to widespread neuronal cell death, although neuroinflammation is commonly associated with glial cells. The presence of the inflammasomes such as nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors protein 1 in neurons accelerates amyloid-beta -induced neuroinflammation and has been shown to trigger neuronal pyroptosis in murine Alzheimer’s disease models. However, the pathways involved in amyloid-beta activation of inflammasomes have yet to be elucidated. In this study, a gene trap mutagenesis approach was utilised to resolve the genes functionally involved in inflammasome signalling within neurons, and the mechanism behind amyloid-beta-induced neuronal death. The results indicate that amyloid-beta significantly accelerated neuroinflammatory cell death in the presence of a primed inflammasome (the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 1). The mutagenesis screen discovered the atypical mitochondrial Ras homolog family member T1 as a significant contributor to amyloid-beta-induced inflammasome -mediated neuronal death. The mutagenesis screen also identified two genes involved in transforming growth factor beta signalling, namely Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor 1 and SNW domain containing 1. Additionally, a gene associated with cytoskeletal reorganisation, SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase Activating Protein 3 was found to be neuroprotective. In conclusion, these genes could play important roles in inflammasome signalling in neurons, which makes them promising therapeutic targets for future drug development against neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: A three-electrode cell setup enables to evaluate the redox behavior of both electrodes, i.e., iron-based metallopolymers (Fe-MEPE) and a complementary switching non-stoichiometric nickel oxide (Ni1-xO, multilayer structure), in detail during full cell operation. In this work, electrochromic devices (ECDs) with a Li reference electrode and different charge density ratios between the electrode materials have been studied (spectro-)electrochemically. The charge density ratio between the electrodes affects the cell voltage, optical contrast, response time, and cycling stability. Here, a neutral-colored bright state was obtained for the unbalanced configuration (ECD-1, charge density ratio Fe-MEPE:Ni1-xO_2 = 2:1, underbalanced) and the balanced configuration (ECD-2, charge density ratio Fe-MEPE:Ni1-xO_3 = 1:1, balanced). The operating voltage range of the ECDs can be narrowed by using a balanced or overbalanced Ni1-xO electrode, e.g., 1.5 V ↔ -1 V for ECD-3 (charge density ratio Fe-MEPE:Ni1-xO_5 = 1:3, overbalanced). Moreover, the cycling stability is enhanced from just a few cycles (ECD-1) to over 1000 potentiostatic switching cycles (ECD-2 and ECD-3).

Abstract: Some animals, such as the chameleon, have great capability of camouflage by changing their skin color to avoid detection. This outstanding property have inspired researchers to develop the ability of the materials and devices to mimic chameleon for applications in intelligent wearable and camouflage devices. Tungsten oxide (WO3), switching between blue and transparent, is widely studied due to its large optical modulation but it is difficult to obtain multicolor and flexibility. Here, we design a bio-inspired chameleon skin electrochromic device (ECD) assembled by inorganic electrochromic materials WO3, which can achieve the reversible color changes from yellow, light green to dark green according to subtractive color mixture theory. The flexible ECD exhibits a high optical reflectance modulation of 38.9% at voltage of ± 1.5 V in the wavelength range of 250–2500 nm. Fast response speed of 0.32 s for both coloring and bleaching process is obtained which can be attributed to the porous structure of the WO3 electrochromic layer. The ECD keeps excellent electrochromic performance even under bending conditions, indicating the great flexibility. The inorganic bio-inspired chameleon skin ECD opens new avenues for the design of intelligent and wearable devices.

Abstract: The precursor status is critical in obtaining high-quality CZTSSe absorbers for direct solution coating method. Here, the ultraviolet-ozone (UV-ozone) oxidation is introduced during precursor film preparation based on DMSO/DMF solutions. It was found that exposing precursor films in ultraviolet ozone with proper duration before selenization treatment effectively reduces the organic residues stemming from solvent and/or component sources. Comparing with the untreated reference sample, the crystallization and morphology of CZTSSe layers with UV-ozone treatment are evidently improved, leading to enhanced carrier lifetime and solar cell device performance. This work provides a feasible way to solve the common problem involving organic residues during CZTSSe layer preparation via a non-hydrazine solution process.

Abstract: In this work, the photostability of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with different functional molecular coatings was investigated. Gold/water nanofluids were prepared using citrate (CIT) reduction, then coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), or bovine serum albumin (BSA) by physical/chemical ligand adsorption. All nanofluids retained their monodispersity and extinction efficiency after ambient storage for three years. These long-term aged nanofluids were then subjected to accelerated indoor tests that mimic the prolonged and cyclic exposure to both full-spectrum and specific-band radiation. This included continuous exposure to broadband solar radiation at various intensities and focused near-ultraviolet (NUV) radiation for different durations, as well as cyclic exposure (in irradiation/darkening periods) to both solar and NUV radiation. Assessment of post-test stability has been realized using complementary characterization techniques. Results showed that stability was variable to the coating type, radiation exposure mode, and radiation spectrum. Subtle physicochemical transitions in the polymeric coatings, even in the absence of ligand desorption and particle clustering, were shown to alter the optical properties and wettability of the nanofluids. While the gold cores remained intact, some photoinduced instabilities occurred in the adsorbed polymeric coatings, including chain scission of PEG, conformational collapse of PVP, and partial denaturation of BSA. Largely attributed to the strong polymer-Au interactions and high surface grafting densities, and despite their coating transformations, AuNPs maintained a high level of photostability. This work marks important progress towards realizing photothermally superior, yet colloidally stable, solar nanofluids compatible with a wide range of direct-absorption photothermal applications in the water and energy sectors.

Abstract: This work discusses developing new black zirconia (ZrO2) composites with high efficiency and optimal properties as a volumetric solar receiver via low cost processing. The major aim is optimizing a new high temperature material with high durability, optical and thermal properties for solar energy applications. This was achieved by blackening of zirconia and producing black zirconia composites through addition of Fe2O3 and MnO2 instead of using coating. Fe2O3 is added to the white zirconia with different content (0–30 wt%) to promote its dark color and enhance its properties. 5 wt% MnO2 is added to assist the blackening and the sintering processes. The different ZrO2/Fe2O3 (0–30 wt%)/MnO2 composites are produced by pressureless sintering method at a temperature of 1700 °C for 2 hrs. Optical, thermal and mechanical performances of the obtained composites are optimized to ensure its suitability and sustainability as solar absorber material. Results indicated that highly dense composites with homogenous microstructural features are attained. Increment of Fe2O3 content has a substantial effect on promoting the thermal and solar to thermal efficiencies of the obtained composites. Composite with 30 wt % Fe2O3 showed the highest solar absorbance in the UV, visible and near IR regions. It recorded the best light emission efficiency with the highest photoluminescence performance. Black ZrO2/Fe2O3/MnO2 composites could be a promising candidate as solar receiver material for thermal solar plants than other reported carbide and nitride materials.

Abstract: Solar-driven interfacial water evaporation is a promising strategy to produce fresh water by effectively converting abundant solar energy into localized heat. In this work, a natural all-in-one three-dimensional (3D) solar vapor generator (SVG) with low-cost and large-scale production based on Cattail (CT) has been proposed. The simple carbonized CT (CCT) as a photothermal material (PM) to construct the 3D SVG exhibited outstanding steam vapor generation performance due to its unique hierarchical porous architecture, rapid water transportation, high water storage capacity, enough steam escape channels and high light capture capability. When the height of CCT exposed to the environment was adjusted to be 10 cm, SVG showed an amazing water evaporation rate of 4.12 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 kW m−2 light intensity, which was higher than those of reported 3D devices, and the photothermal conversion efficiency was as high as 105.8%. The environmental energy was utilized to enhance the water evaporation performance by forming a cold evaporation surface. In addition, a device for collecting evaporated water outdoors has been designed, with an average evaporation rate of 1.04 kg m−2 h−1, about 8.32 kg m−2·day−1, demonstrating an excellent application prospect in the field of producing fresh water.

Abstract: A novel ternary eutectic salt KNO3-NaNO2-KNO2 (KNK) was designed and prepared for thermal energy storage (TES) in a concentrating solar power system (CSP). The thermo-physical properties of KNK such as melting point, decomposition temperature, fusion enthalpy, density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity were determined respectively. Furthermore the thermal energy storage capacity was evaluated and discussed. Then a comparison of the thermo-physical properties between commercial Hitec and KNK was carried out. KNK showed smaller density, lower viscosity, slightly smaller thermal conductivity, much higher specific heat capacity and bigger thermal energy storage capacity. Raman spectrum displayed that the N-O of NaNO2 frequency peak at about 820 cm−1 in KNK had more significant shift, which could be attributed to a stronger interaction between Na+ and NO2−. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed K and Na elements of Hitec were uniformly distributed, while K and Na elements of KNK were in complementary distribution which could be caused by stronger repulsion between Na+ and K+. It was concluded that the stronger interaction and repulsion were correlated to the higher specific heat capacity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to explore the different macroscopic properties of two molten salts from the perspective at molecular level. The characterizations of radial distribution functions (RDF), coordination number and angular distribution functions (ADF) suggested that the interaction between Na+ and NO2− is stronger and that the arrangement of ion clusters was looser in KNK. The results were in good agreement with the analysis of Raman spectrum and SEM.

Abstract: As high temperature thermal energy storage materials, Na2CO3/MgO composites have been investigated extensively. However, theirs thermophysical properties, especially thermal conductivities, need improvements to satisfy the requirements for further efficiency in energy storage system. In this paper, Bi2O3 was tried and doped into the Na2CO3/MgO composites and the possible influence of Bi2O3 on the thermal properties of the composites was investigated for the first time. Our purpose is to achieve thermal performance optimization of these composites. Depending upon SEM, DSC techniques, a detailed analysis on possible relations between thermal properties, including both thermal enthalpy and conductivity, and sintering technique was carried out in this paper. The obtained results suggested that Bi2O3 is an effective additive, which can enhance thermal conductivities of the composites significantly. With the added amount of Bi2O3 as 1-3 wt%, the thermal conductivity value could be increased from 2 to 3.5 W/(m·K) with variety in enthalpy value controlled less than 5% for the sample prepared at 830–840 °C with the ratio of Na2CO3 to MgO as 50:50.

Abstract: A chloride-based molten-salt system that uses a ternary blend of MgCl2/KCl/NaCl is investigated to provide higher-temperature thermal energy storage capability than conventional nitrate salt-based systems. Despite their high thermal stability and operating temperature, molten chlorides present several challenges, including the design of internal liners to prevent the corrosion and thermal stress of alloy tank shells. This work discusses issues and potential solutions related to containment of molten chloride salt, specifically the optimization of the hot face refractory materials for use as internal liners. Three down-selected refractory materials were analyzed with respect to permeation of salt through the material as well as chemical stability during high temperature operation. Through the application of X-ray imaging and electron spectroscopy techniques, highly stable secondary surface phases in equilibrium with the molten salt were identified, as well as time-dependent changes in the salt composition itself.

Abstract: The instability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is still an unsettled problem that restricts its further commercialization. A hybrid dimension structure built by one-dimensional and three-dimensional perovskites (1D-3D) is an efficient strategy for improving the stability of PSCs. Herein, self-assembled 1D perovskite nanowires (1D-PNWs) have been successfully constructed by introducing a small amount of Urotropin (UTP) into the perovskite precursor solution used in a two-step preparation method that leads to passivate grain boundaries and thereby improves film crystallinity and reduced defects. The photovoltaic performance of the modified PSC at the optimum amount of UTP (5% molar percentage) has been significantly improved concerning the control devices due to the suppression of non-radiative recombination in the defects and GBs. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the optimum device increased from 11.47% to 19.15% with negligible hysteresis. This device was more stable than the control device, with only 5.08% PCE decline within 42 days in a relative humidity level of 38 ± 2 without encapsulation. This study introduces the 1D-PNW network growth by a self-assembly process to provide a feasible and effective strategy to fabricate cheap and extra stable perovskite solar cells.

Abstract: As a representative device exploiting both the solar energy and the radiative cooling of deep-sky, the radiative temperature regulator (RTR) could switch between heating and cooling modes self-adaptively at different temperatures. However, the concept of RTR is challenging to be implemented due to the intense parasitic absorption in phase-changing layers. Here, based on the theoretical framework of energy conservation, we quantitatively reveal the intrinsic relationships between solar heating and radiative cooling, especially addressing the fundamental limiting factors, including the parasitic absorption and the spectral emission selectivity, as well as the dynamic responses of the phase-changing device under various operating conditions. The investigation presents more insight into the underlying physics of RTRs and provides feasible architectures for realizing such a kind of new functional device.

Abstract: One of the advantages of Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) thin film solar cells is the lower temperature sensitivity of the solar cell parameters as compared to conventional silicon-based technologies. To further improve and to tailor CIGSSe temperature behavior for different environments, it is important to gain a detailed understanding of the microscopic mechanisms involved. The goal of the current study is to elucidate the impact of the individual functional layers within the CIGSSe solar cell stack on the temperature dependence of the overall cell performance. For this purpose, temperature-dependent current-voltage measurements were performed on a selected set of CIGSSe cells, containing a systematic variation of functional layers. The experimental results demonstrate that the absorber layer exhibits the largest influence on the temperature dependence of the power efficiency. An analysis of the contributing parameters revealed that the temperature-dependence of the power efficiency is mainly governed by a change in the open-circuit voltage. The temperature coefficient of the open-circuit voltage is analyzed in terms of the cell's physical parameters, including their minimum band gap and the temperature-dependence of the dark saturation current.

Abstract: The mesophase pitch derived graphite foams with low bulk density (L-GF) and high bulk density (H-GF) were spontaneously infiltrated by erythritol to prepare graphite foam/erythritol (GF/erythritol) phase change materials (PCMs) with ultrahigh thermal conductivity for medium temperature thermal energy storage applications. Results of thermophysical properties indicated that thermal diffusivity of the GF/erythritol PCMs can be enhanced by 66 and 117 times as compared with that of pristine erythritol in solid (0.36 mm2/s). This enhancement resulting from three-dimensional ordered network of graphite foam can significantly reduce the charging and discharging time of the PCM storage system. Although H-GF as a matrix can obtain a higher thermal conductivity (68.71 W/(m·K)) than L-GF (40.52 W/(m·K)), the smaller porosity cannot allow more erythritol to be absorbed, and its melting enthalpy (178.4 J/g) is lower than L-GF (266.6 J/g). In addition, the enhancement of thermal conductivity and the increase of interfacial surface area caused by graphite foam structure strongly suppresses the supercooling of erythritol, which can be reduced from 86.0 °C to 53.2 °C. The obtained results demonstrated that the GF/erythritol PCM as a stable PCM is a promising material for medium temperature thermal energy storage applications.

Abstract: Inorganic salt hydrates have a great potential for solar photothermal energy storage due to their high energy-storage density and low cost. However, there are some major drawbacks such as high supercooling degree, shape/form instability, phase segregation, and poor long-term durability found in salt hydrates. These greatly limit their practical applications. Herein, we designed and fabricated a type of eco-friendly and cost-efficient phase-change system based on sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) as an inorganic phase change material and biomass-derived carbonaceous sheets (BDCSs) as a supporting material for high-efficient solar photothermal energy storage and shape stabilization. Derived from a biomass waste of watermelon rind, the BDCSs show some unique characteristics such as a stacking lamellar structure and a compact surface with some corrugations and ripples as well as the presence of abundant oxygen-rich groups. These can lead to a significant enhancement in photothermal conversion efficiency of solar energy when used as a supporting material for a SAT-based phase-change composite system. This type of composite system not only presents a high thermal energy capacity of 212.2 J/g and a very low supercooling degree of 0.9 °C, but also has a high photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 80.18% for solar energy. Moreover, the composite system exhibits high thermal conductance, good shape stability without phase segregation, and excellent thermal cycle stability for long-term solar photothermal energy storage and release. This study provides a simple and facile methodology for the development of bio-based phase-change composites for high-efficient solar energy utilization.

Abstract: The effect of different quantum structures in the intrinsic region of a pin junction solar cell (SC) on the optical and electrical properties have been investigated. SCs with different quantum structures, such as, Stranski-Krastanov (SK) quantum dots (QDs), quantum well (QW), submonolayer (SML) QDs (0.25 ML, 0.5 ML and 0.75 ML) and a quasi-monolayer (1 ML) InAs stack, were fabricated while keeping the total InAs content the same in all SCs. In a comparison of performance, the SML-QD sample delivered superior performance (Almost 23% relative efficiency improvement compared to reference SC) compared to the other devices. Moreover, different coverages of SML InAs have been tested for optimum performance improvement of solar cell and near 0.25 ML InAs deposition was found best for solar cell application. These findings present a promising alternative to SK-QDs as intermediate band in photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: With the pursuit of high photoelectric conversion efficiency in the photovoltaic market, passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) modules has become the new market mainstream. The environmental impact of PERC modules requires life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to analyze. The SimaPro software was used to calculate the environmental impacts, such as global warming potential (GWP), human toxicity potential – cancer effects (HTP-CE), human toxicity potential-non-cancer effects (HTP-nCE), freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FEcP), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEuP) and abiotic depletion potential (ADP) of mono-facial and bifacial (dual-glass encapsulation and transparent back-sheet encapsulation) PERC modules prepared using 158.75 mm, 166 mm and 210 mm silicon wafers. The rear side gain of a bifacial module increases its electricity generation in the Use stage, and thereby making bifacial module achieve better environmental performance than mono-facial module. In order to improve the rear side gain of bifacial module, it is usually necessary to select an appropriate ground reflective material in system design. The LCA results show that the waterproof membrane TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin) is a very good choice, and white gravel and grassland can also be considered in landscape design point of view. Whether to choose dual-glass encapsulation or transparent back-sheet encapsulation, has little effect on the overall environmental impact of bifacial modules. In addition, adding recycling in the photovoltaic industry chain can significantly reduce the overall environmental impact of photovoltaic modules, especially in the indicators such as ADP, HTP-CE and FEuP.

Abstract: Formation of an interfacial tunnel oxide capped by the polysilicon (poly-Si) layer is one of the most promising methods to realize carrier-selective contacts as it offers an evolutionary upgrade to the current mainstream PERC. Currently, PV industry is looking towards different technologically feasible options of transferring this cell concept from laboratory research towards industrial manufacturing. In this paper, we devise cost-driven strategies towards industrial manufacturing of TOPCon-based solar cells after assessing various process routes based on currently production-ready and upcoming future alternative process technologies. Our techno-economic assessment suggests that higher capital and operational costs required for TOPCon concept is distributed unevenly in the process value chain, with a significant fraction in diffusion/annealing and metallization steps. Nevertheless, under given assumptions, TOPCon-concepts are found to remain economically competitive against bifacial PERC in terms of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), if a minimum absolute gain in cell efficiency Δη > 0.55% for most-conservative and Δη > 0.40% for most-progressive scenarios respectively can be maintained.

Abstract: Organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) with efficiency over 25% and high stability have been reported, however, lead (Pb)-free PeSCs should be developed for the commercialization due to the toxicity of Pb. Among the candidates to replace Pb, tin (Sn) based PeSCs are leading for their low band gap and high efficiency compared to other metal candidates. In the research for Sn-based PeSCs, Sn oxidation is a critical issue to influence on both of the efficiency and stability. Here, we present a simple Cl‾-doping method to increase the resistance to oxidation in Sn-based PeSCs. Cl‾-doped perovskite film had large grains and highly-oriented crystals; these traits increased the electron and hole mobility and reduced the density of trap states in the perovskite film. Cl‾ became located at surface defects, and thereby prevented Sn oxidation. Cl‾ doping yielded PeSCs that had efficiency as high as 7.14%, with high reproducibility and stability under ambient conditions.

Abstract: Photovoltaic-thermoelectric (PV-TE) conversion is a promising method for power generation, which converts solar power into electricity using the photovoltaic (PV) effect of solar cells and simultaneously generates electricity by the Seebeck effect of the thermoelectric (TE) device based on the waste heat of solar cells. Here, the power generation of the PV-TE device at night is experimentally demonstrated using radiative cooling that harnesses the cold of the universe directly. The PV-TE device is constructed by attaching a TE device on the bottom of the glass-covered PV module, with a heat sink stuck on the opposite side of the TE device. The open-circuit voltage of the TE device integrated into the PV-TE device was measured to be approximately 9 mV, indicating that the PV-TE device can definitely generate electricity from the darkness. Moreover, a new configuration of the PV-TE device for continuous power generation in the day and night is conceptually proposed for further consideration. In summary, this work proves the possibility of the PV-TE device for nighttime power generation, which could provide an alternative pathway for a wide range of nighttime and all-day power-consumed applications, such as lower power sensors and monitors.

Abstract: In this work, light-induced degradation (LID) experiments were performed on p-type boron-doped Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si) wafers under different conditions, aiming to separately characterize boron-oxygen related LID (BO-LID) and “light and elevated temperature-induced degradation” (LeTID). We found that the regeneration rate of BO-LID, as well as the extent and kinetics of LeTID, were strongly influenced by peak firing temperature. These dependences can be explained by the variation of hydrogen concentration, which was modulated by peak firing temperature. Furthermore, we found that extending the duration of dark annealing pre-treatment decelerates the subsequent regeneration of BO defects. This result revealed that, under dark annealing, the evolution of LeTID was accompanied by a notable decrease in the mobile hydrogen concentration. Supported by this phenomenon, a hydrogen-related model based on reversible reaction is proposed to describe the LeTID behavior in crystalline silicon.

Abstract: Air-stable caesium tin iodide (Cs2SnI6) double perovskite are highly desirable for substituting the lead-based halide perovskite solar cells. In this work, we have investigated the effect of A-site tailoring in Cs2SnI6 by adding monovalent cation (Rb and Ag) on film growth properties, (morphology, structural properties, opto-physical properties), optoelectronic properties, and device characteristics. The crystal analysis suggests that the A-site additives suppress CsI secondary phase in (Cs1-xAx)2SnI6 film for x<0.5 whereas multiple secondary phases occur in higher additive content. The opto-physical properties reveal a small change in bandgap energy for alloyed film and excellent thermal stability in ambient air. The inverted device structure ITO/CuI/Cs2SnI6-alloyed/PCBM/AZO/Ag, for the first time, demonstrated the improvement in device parameters (with VOC~ 0.38 V and efficiency of ~0.66%) for the alloyed films. The capacitance analysis reveals that the high defect density in bulk as well as at the interface (Nt>1019 cm−3) has a deleterious effect on the device performance. In this work, we underline insight into the A-site tailoring of Cs2SnI6 double perovskite and the dominant limiting factors for getting high device performance.

Abstract: Etching characteristics of lattice-matched GaInP/GaAs/GaInNAsSb heterostructures by aqueous solutions of iodic acid (HIO3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is reported. The study aims at optimization of mesa fabrication process involved in the development of III‒V multijunction solar cells. The effects of temperature, agitation, etchant composition, and illumination on the etching selectivity are investigated. Varying the etchant composition and agitation rate at room temperature results in various mesa sidewall morphologies, ranging from rough surfaces and significant undercut to smoother sidewall profiles with only minor undercut. Especially, the undercut emerging in the GaInNAsSb junction, as well as in the AlInP layers, was observed for several etching conditions. Increasing the etching temperature also caused an unwanted increase in the selectivity, whereas reducing the temperature below the room temperature enhanced remarkably the formation of smooth morphology. Illumination during the etching resulted in a severe undercut in the GaAs junction, due to an increased selectivity caused by photoetching. This points out the need of controlled illumination condition to avoid unwanted reactions in wet etching of such multijunction structures. The etching process resulting in the best morphology was used for electrical isolation of triple-junction GaInP/GaAs/GaInNAsSb solar cells. The good photovoltaic performance exhibited by these devices proves the suitability of the nonselective etch process in developing multijunction solar cells.

Abstract: Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a monogenic disease and it is estimated that 300,000 infants are born annually with it. Most treatments available are only palliative, whereas the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers the only potential cure for SCD.
Objective
Generation of human autologous cells, when coupled with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, is a promising approach for developing study models. In this study, we provide a simple and efficient model for generating hematopoietic cells using iPSCs derived from a sickle cell anemia patient and an inexpensive in-house-prepared medium.
Method
This study used iPSCs previously generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a patient with sickle cell anemia (iPSC_scd). Hematopoietic and erythroid differentiation was performed in two steps. Firstly, with the induction of hematopoietic differentiation through embryoid body formation, we evaluated the efficiency of two serum-free media; and secondly, the induction of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to erythroid progenitor cells was performed.
Results
The patient-specific cell line generated CD34+/CD45+ and CD45+/CD43+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and erythroid progenitors, comprising CD36+, CD71+ and CD235a+ populations, as well as the formation of hematopoietic colonies, including erythroid colonies, in culture in a semi-solid medium.
Conclusion
In conjunction, our results described a simple serum-free platform to differentiate human the iPSCs into hematopoietic progenitor cells. This platform is an emerging application of iPSCs in vitro disease modeling, which can significantly improve the search for new pharmacological drugs for sickle cell disease.

Abstract: Homocysteine (Hcy) is a strong and independent risk factor of atherosclerosis. It can accelerate atherosclerosis through increased production of inflammatory factors, especially interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), while the precise mechanisms remain to be well elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of the tumor suppressor gene SNF5 related to switch/sucrose non-fermentable complex (SWI/SNF) in the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis induced by Hcy. Using Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) atherosclerotic model with apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE−/−) mice fed with high-methionine diet, we showed that Hcy aggravates inflammation in macrophages during the atherosclerotic plaque formation. Further analysis showed that SNF5 promotes IL-1β expression and secretion. In addition, due to the existence of H3K4 methylation signals in the vicinity of IL-1β, we found that Hcy significantly promotes the expression of H3K4me1, and lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (KDM1A) acts as a transcriptional repressor to regulate the expression of H3K4me1 by demethylating H3K4me1. In summary, our results demonstrated that Hcy up-regulates the expression of SNF5 through KDM1A, resulting in an increased level of H3K4me1 modification and IL-1β in macrophages, which in turn promotes the formation of atherosclerosis. Our study will provide more evidence for further revealing the specific mechanism of Hcy-induced inflammation and the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: The molybdenum (Mo) back contact is one of the crucial factor that affects the performance of kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin film solar cells. Thick MoS2 which is formed during sulfurization process of CZTS is known to be harmful for the device performance. MoOx on surface of Mo substrate with proper thickness can enhance the efficiency of CZTS solar cells through reducing the thickness of MoS2 layer and tailoring the work function of back contact. However, the role of oxidation states of Mo in MoOx on the performance of solar cells is unclear. Herein the effect of MoOx with different oxidation states on CZTS absorber and intermediate MoS2 layer were investigated. Our results shown that the efficiency of CZTS solar cells on Mo substrate with proper surface oxidation status (MoO2.03) can be as high as 2.86 times of the one fabricated on higher oxidized Mo (MoO2.21), although the thinnest MoS2 layer was present in the latter case. This work discloses the origin of the oxidation states of Mo for the efficiency enhancement of kesterite structured solar cells. The results will be also helpful to improve the performance of compound semiconductor by oxidation states control strategy.

Abstract: Owing to their poor electrochemical properties, photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar water splitting and electrochemical energy storage activity of BiVO4 are presently limited in their applications. One of the effective methods for improving electrochemical activity is the doping of noble-metal ions into the host lattice. The doping of noble-metal ions can improve absorption in visible light and support the direct transfer of energy via hot electrons. In this study, the synthesis of Au-doped BiVO4 nanostructured catalysts with different concentrations of Au ions was prepared via a template-free ultrasonication technique, and it's both solar-driven PEC water splitting and electrochemical storage properties were examined. The optimal doped photoelectrode exhibited a lower resistance to charge transfer than other photoelectrodes, including a significant enhancement in photocurrent density (0.102 mAcm−2), which is approximately 4.1 times superior over undoped photoanode. Furthermore, the optimal doped electrode exhibited an electrochemical capacitance that is 2 times greater than that of the pure electrode. The excellent electrochemical behavior and PEC properties of the optimal doped electrode were attributed to the increase in surface area and suitable band gap. Consequently, enables the dispersion of electron at the interface of electrode/electrolyte. Solar PEC solar water splitting and supercapacitor performance of the optimal doped electrodes were significantly improved by the proper incorporation of Au ions.

Abstract: The modulation of the organic Fabry-Perot electrodes was considered to develop the selective color-gamut perovskite (PVK) solar cells, and the solution-based processes were used to develop large, rapid and economic colorful solar cells referred to as building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems. An planar p-i-n perovskite solar cell structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK/PCBM/Ag/PCBM/Ag were synthesized with different precursor concentrations ranging from 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, to 1.75 M. The selective color-gamut for Fabry-Perot electrodes was simulated with different thickness of n-type PCBM and p-type PEDOT:PSS. The results showed that the surface coverage increased from 48.91% to 54.47% when the precursor concentration increased from 0.75 to 1.5 M. However, the surface coverage reduced to 47.05% when the precursor concentration was 1.75 M. The color gamut of the PCBM cavity was more reddish than that of PEDOT:PSS cavity in the CIE1931 colorimetric diagram, and the color gamut could be modulated with blue and green colors for PCBM and PEDOT:PSS cavities, respectively. Interestingly, although p-type PEDOT:PSS causes danger to the hydrolysis, n-type PCBM is suitable for spin coating, and the conversion gain could be enhanced to 122, 118 and 123% for the brown, yellow and red colors, respectively.

Abstract: Inspired by the structural white of natural fibers, this work here demonstrated a novel passive radiative cooling design that builds random, three-dimensional pores in polymer matrix via the phase separation-based method. The pore size and structure are controlled by the compatibility between the shape-supporting matrix and other soluble polymers, where the semi-crystalline polypropylene (PP) was used as the shape-supporting matrix that is insoluble in any organic solvent at room temperature, and the soluble polymers were styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS) and styrene-ethylene-propylene-styrene block copolymer (SEPS). The experimental results revealed that those macroporous PP sheets have high solar reflectance (~97%) and tunable thermal emissivity (0.81-0.67). The outdoor thermal measurement also shows that those macroporous PP film-covered devices displayed a temperature (44.0 °C), much lower than those of air (50.0 °C) and neat-PP-covered device (60.4 °C). The complete simulation of a building thermal behavior evaluation shows that the macroporous PP roof-covered buildings exhibit a higher cooling effect than the neat PP roof-covered building in summer. Therefore, the required cooling power of the macroporous PP roof-covered buildings saved about 200 W compared with the neat PP roof-covered building on a typical summer day.

Abstract: Although various metal oxide particles have been used as infrared (IR)-reflective materials, the development of cost-effective new materials has still been a challenge for highly efficient IR reflection. In this work, a spinel iron aluminate (FeAl2O4) particle was first proposed as a new candidate IR-reflective material in the form of composite polymer particles prepared by suspension polymerization. High colloidal stable and spherical poly (methyl methacrylate-butyl acrylate-divinyl benzene) (P (MMA-BA-DVB)) particles containing oleic coated-FeAl2O4 particles (P (MMA-BA-DVB)/o-FeAl2O4) with high encapsulation efficiency were obtained. Because of the low Tg PBA component in the polymer particles, the prepared composite polymer particles were easily self-coated onto the substrate without an external binder. The obtained P (MMA-BA-DVB)/o-FeAl2O4 particles at a 40:40:20 ratio of MMA: BA: DVB showed the highest IR reflection, close to that of the pristine FeAl2O4 particles. Moreover, the temperature control efficiency in terms of ΔT of P (MMA-BA-DVB)/o-FeAl2O4-coated glass (15–16 °C) and metal sheets (12–13 °C) was much higher than that of the bare glass and metal sheets (3–4 °C). These results indicate that the prepared composite polymer particles represent excellent IR reflection, temperature control, and self-coating property on various substrates. They would be a good novel candidate for cooling applications.

Abstract: In this paper, vanadium dioxide thin films were successfully deposited at room temperature by high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) using two different magnetron configurations: (i) a conventional balanced magnetron and (ii) an unbalanced magnetron. In the case of the unbalanced magnetron, the magnetic field is extended towards the substrate and the energetic ions in the plasma actively participate in film growth allowing to improve film crystallinity. The as-deposited thin films were annealed under Ar flow for 1 h to obtain thermochromic VO2(M) phase. The 120 nm films were first characterized at room temperature by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Then, the thermochromic behavior of the VO2 films was investigated by electrical and optical characterizations. The effect of annealing temperature on thermochromic properties of VO2 was studied showing that high quality VO2(M) film can be obtained at 300 °C using unbalanced HiPIMS. A very efficient change in transmittance exceeding 70% is observed in the IR spectral region. This investigation demonstrates the capability of using unbalanced HiPIMS to achieve high optical performances for VO2 at lower temperature as well as the potential of this technology for the deposition of VO2(M) films onto temperature-sensitive substrates.

Abstract: We performed advanced opto-electrical simulations on thin-film BaSi2 solar cells. First, absorption spectra of BaSi2-pn homojunction solar cells on Si substrate were calculated based on flat and/or pyramidally-textured surfaces, wherein 20-nm-thick n+-BaSi2 was the topmost electron transport layer. By changing the front surface structure from flat to texture, the reflectance decreased in the wavelength (λ) range 700–1200 nm and the photocurrent density (Jph) delivered by the photogenerated carriers in the 500-nm thick p-BaSi2 layer increased by 1.2 mA/cm2. Simulations revealed that the key factor inhibiting light absorption in the p-BaSi2 layer was parasitic absorption in the n+-BaSi2 and in the c-Si substrate. To solve these optical issues, we propose a new device structure, Al-doped n+-ZnO (AZO, 50 nm)/i-ZnO (20 nm)/p-BaSi2 (500 nm) heterojunction solar cell (HJSC). In this device structure, the parasitic absorption reduced drastically, and Jph reached 30.23 mA/cm2. Furthermore, by replacing the Si substrate with a glass substrate, the light trapping worked more effectively, and the absorber layer thickness required for Jph to saturate was reduced to 1 μm, yielding 32.06 mA/cm2. Based on these simulation results, we manufactured n+-AZO/p-BaSi2 HJSC. The internal quantum efficiency exceeded 30% at λ = 600 nm, meaning that we demonstrated the operation of n+-AZO/p-BaSi2 HJSC for the first time. We investigated origins of small efficiencies compared to those simulated, and found that the passivation of defects in the p-BaSi2 layer and the reduction of carrier recombination at the i-ZnO/p-BaSi2 interface would significantly improve the solar cell performance.

Abstract: Recently, a hybrid perovskite material, ABX3 (A= Cs, CH3NH3, NH2CHNH2; B= Pb, Sn; X= Cl, Br, I), has received much attention as an active layer in new-generation solar cells. This material is usually fabricated with either a one-step or a two step process in solution. However, the surface morphology, nucleation rate and grain growth rate of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite light absorber prepared by the solution reaction process (SRP) are hard to control. Here, we show a fast solid-solid reaction process (SSRP), to fabricate ultraflat (roughness of approximately 12 nm) CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films with large grain sizes (~947 nm). The SSRP simply involves directly contacting a lead iodide thin film (PbI2) with methylammonium iodide powder (CH3NH3I) without any chemical reagents at 120°C under a normal atmospheric environment. The SSRP reaction dynamics is investigated by an in situ heating scanning electron microscope (SEM) system. This innovative SSRP is an easy approach for the large-scale fabrication of planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells and allows us to demonstrate a power conversion efficiency of approximately 15.27% (active area of 0.16 cm2).

In the pre-TKI era, front-line allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) represented the standard approach for patients with chronic phase-CML (CP-CML) who were deemed fit to tolerate the procedure and had a human leukocyte antigen compatible donor available. Currently, CP-CML patients are eligible for allo-HCT only if they fail more than one TKI and/or are intolerant to the drug. We performed a systematic review/meta-analysis of the available literature to assess the evidence regarding allo-HCT efficacy in CP-CML patients. Data from eligible studies were extracted in relation to benefits (overall survival [OS], progression-free survival, disease-free survival [DFS], complete remission [CR], and molecular response [MR]) and harms (nonrelapse mortality [NRM], relapse, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease), and stratified by age into adult and pediatric groups. For adult allo-HCT recipients, the pooled OS, DFS, CR and, MR were 84% [95% confidence interval (CI) 59–99%], 66% (95% CI 59–73%), 56% (95% CI 30–80%), and 88% (95% CI 62–98%), respectively. Pooled NRM and relapse were 20% (95% CI 15–26%) and 19% (95% CI 10–28%), respectively. For the pediatric group, the OS rate was reported in one study and was 91% (95% CI 72–99%). Our results suggest that allo-HCT is an effective treatment for TKI-resistant or TKI-intolerant CP-CML. Post-transplant strategies are still needed to further mitigate the risk of relapse.

Abstract: Early diagnosis and precise monitoring of the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) can significantly improve therapeutic strategies and help decrease blindness caused by it. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were recently found to be involved in intercellular communications and are a potential source for the discovery of novel biomarkers. The current study aims to investigate the effectiveness of microRNAs (miRNAs) encapsulated in small EVs (sEVs) as minimally invasive biomarkers for PDR. SEVs were extracted from plasma of healthy subjects, diabetic patients, nonPDR patients and PDR patients. Then, we performed microarray analysis to determine the miRNA expression profile. MiR-431-5p expression doubled in the PDR patients compared with the healthy controls and the diabetic patients. We further found that miR-431-5p expression was 2.3 times higher in 4-hydroxynonenal treated human retinal capillary endothelial cells (HRCECs) than the control. After transfection with miR-431-5p mimics, proliferation of HRCECs was promoted, while transfection with miR-431-5p inhibitor demonstrated the opposite effect. The present findings indicate that circulating sEVs showed a differential miRNA profile in PDR patients. MiR-431-5p was involved in the pathogenesis of PDR development and may function as a novel biomarker for PDR.

Abstract: Eutectic chloride salts are a new and novel type of thermal energy storage (TES) material for high-temperature solar TES systems. Their thermal properties and stability are key factors in determining their application in TES systems. In this study, we prepared and characterized eutectic NaCl–KCl–MgCl2/α-alumina/expanded graphite (EG) composite phase change materials (PCMs). The results show that eutectic salts, α-alumina and EG have good crystalline properties and chemical compatibility. The elements are relatively uniform in distribution within the pores and channels. Moreover, the Na, K, and Mg distributions occupy the same locations, indicating the excellent eutectic properties of the salts. The latent heat of composite PCMs decreases with the increase in α-alumina and EG percentage, while the addition of EG to the eutectic salts/α-alumina composite PCM improves the thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs by more than 6 times, from 0.85 to 5.10 W/(m·K). Moreover, after 50, 100, and 300 heating–cooling cycles at 550 °C, the composite PCMs demonstrate enhanced thermal and physical properties at high temperatures. The improved thermal characteristics of composite PCMs with α-alumina and EG allow for promising applications of high-temperature solar TES systems.

Abstract: Silicon heterojunction solar cells based on transition metal oxide carrier-selective contact layers have great potential to achieve high efficiency and low cost. Such system exhibits much lower conversion efficiency compared to the theoretically predicted value. This is mainly due to the difficulty in simultaneously obtaining surface passivation and carrier selectivity at the heterojunction interface. Here we developed a dual-functional SiOx/MoS2 quantum dots hybrid material by ALD in situ growth. The silicon surface is passivated by ultra-thin SiOx layer while the band gap of MoS2 is widen associated with the quantum confinement effect (>3.0 eV for quantum dots). The impurity level is introduced through Mo–O defect engineering, which facilitates carrier selectivity by trap-assisted tunneling. The hybrid materials enabled improved silicon heterojunction solar cells performance with a PCE up to 22.8%. Our advanced interface engineering not only presented a low-cost, high efficiency technical scheme, but also provided guidelines for the design of new low-dimensional hybrid system.

Abstract: Solar steam generation (SSG) has emerged as one of renewable and environmentally friendly technologies for production of fresh water. Here, we demonstrate the preparation of a novel oil-repellent photothermal materials based on copper foam (CF) for efficient SSG. Only by a simple chemical oxidation treatment on CF (named as R–CF), the smooth CF skeleton changes to be rough, leading to an enhanced light absorption of up to 90% which is far higher than that of untreated CF (10–70%). By combination of its high porosity (89.6%) and high specific surface area (230 m2 g−1), the R–CF shows superior ability on SSG as well as salt-resistance, i.e., its evaporation efficiency in water and high saline solution reaches 85.25% and 70.19% under 1 kW m−2 irradiation, respectively. In addition, R–CF was further treated by a surface chemical modification to achieve hydrophilicity while oil-repellent wettability (named as OR-R-CF), enabling it solar vaporization even in oily water, e.g., an evaporation efficiency of 77.0% was obtained in oily water, which is great advantageous to those existing photothermal materials usually suffer the drawbacks of poor oil-repellent or anti-fouling property and thus shows significant potentials for practical SSG applications in both seawater and oily water.

Abstract: The viability of commercial Ga-doped silicon PERC solar cell is decided by its efficiency, cost and reliability. In this article, the viability of Ga-doped Cz-Si PERC solar cells has been investigated systematically from an industrial perspective. Firstly, the relationship of wafer resistivity, contact fraction and variation of series resistance for PERC solar cell has been established for increasing the usage rate of Ga-doped crystal. Then, based on the relationship, an average efficiency of 22.21% for the PERC cells with five busbars fabricated from the whole Ga-doped CZ crystal has been achieved. The statistical results of electrical parameters show that the PERC cells fabricated on Ga-doped Cz-Si wafers with a wide resistivity variation (0.5–2.0 Ω⋅cm) are highly comparable with that of PERC cells made from B-doped Cz-Si wafers with typical resistivity (0.5–1.0 Ω⋅cm). The obtained results demonstrated that the full range of resistivity values produced from a Ga-doped Cz crystal can be used to fabricate quality, cost-effective PERC solar cells. Meanwhile, a comparative study of initial degradation for optimized Ga-doped PERC solar cells and stabilized B-doped PERC solar cells was carried out in accumulative irradiation of 20 kWh/m2 at 50 °C and 80 °C. The results indicate that Ga-doped PERC cells are more stable than stabilized B-doped PERC cells even though at high temperature. The results obtained in this paper demonstrate the viability of Ga- instead of B-doped Cz-Si wafer as substrate to fabricate cost-effective PERC solar cells.

Abstract: N,N,N′,N′-tetraphenylbenzidine (TPB) and N,N,N′,N′-tetra(p-tolyl)benzidine (TPB-4Me), were synthesized. Their optoelectrochemical and electrochromic properties were discussed. Both TPB and TPB-4Me exhibited a reversible color change between colorless and dark-green under applied bias voltages. Furthermore, TPB or TPB-4Me and ethyl viologen (EV) or tungsten trioxide (WO3) were used as anode and cathode electrochromic materials, respectively; a series of color complementary ambipolar gel electrochromic devices (ECDs), ECD-3, ECD-4, ECD-5, and ECD-6, were fabricated and investigated. All of ambipolar ECDs displayed reversible color changes between transparent and black under different voltages. In addition, they exhibited high optical contrast in both visible and near-infrared regions; their corresponding optical contrasts were 74.6%, 87.9%, 78.2%, and 78.5% at 750 nm, respectively. In comparison, ECDs based on WO3 exhibited higher optical contrast (in near-infrared region) and shorter bleaching time than ECDs based on EV. The optical contrasts of ECD-5 and ECD-6 based on WO3 were greater than 57.6% and 54.0% in the wavelength range of 420–1000 nm, respectively. Their corresponding coloring/bleaching times were found to be 6.6 s/21.7 s and 6.0 s/24.6 s, respectively. The transparent-to-black attributes of these ambipolar ECDs are promising for electrochromic smart windows.

Abstract: The perovskite solar cell technology is showing rapid progress in delivering high power conversion efficiency. This is not limited to conventional 1 SUN illumination, but state-of-the-art results have also been also demonstrated for a low-light condition such as indoor illumination. In this work, we show that very efficient low-light perovskite solar cells can be realized in the inverted configuration with the use of NiO as a hole transporting material by employing a conventional high-temperature process (300 °C, compact NiO) or a low-temperature process (<100 °C) based on nanoparticle NiO. The power density of 90.2 μW/cm2 at 1000 lux was achieved for compact NiO device, while 71.6 μW/cm2 was obtained with nanoparticle NiO cells under the same illumination. A detailed electrical, optical, and morphological characterization permitted to identify the reasons for the difference between compact and nanoparticle NiO. Beside the difference in power density, nanoparticle NiO permitted to realize the first low temperature inorganic hole transporting layer for low-light p-i-n perovskite solar cell and, as we show, this could be easily scaled up to 1 cm2 without suffering for performance losses moving from small to large area.

Abstract: Safe implementation of reusable crucibles in the silicon PV industry requires a thorough understanding of the reactions in the system to avoid liquid infiltration and crucible failure at high temperatures. Typically, an oxidized Si3N4-coating layer is applied to the crucibles to avoid wetting. During melting, the coating undergoes a transition in its wettability behavior as a result of oxide depletion. However, much uncertainty still exists about undergoing reactions and their effect on the coating depletion, and hence the wetting kinetics. Here we report on the coating's oxygen depletion mechanisms by applying a novel coating method to avoid conventional oxidation as it causes severe degradation of non-oxide crucibles. By adding colloidal silica to the silicon nitride coating, we (i) control the oxygen concentration in the coating, (ii) avoid the crucible degradation, and (iii) eliminate the pre-oxidation step. Furthermore, a quantification of the coating's oxygen content effect on the depletion rate was presented via an analytical model. These results provided insight into how the coating depletion can hinder the liquid infiltration by forming and stabilizing silicon oxynitride in the coating as evidenced by Raman mapping and thermodynamic calculations. The difference between the rates of liquid infiltration and oxygen depletion was also elucidated in detail.

Abstract: Water scarcity, energy and demographic nature are real challenges facing many countries worldwide. These are maximized in rural communities where using the conventional energy resources for freshwater production may not be available. Thus the present study develops a novel double-effect tubular solar still installed at a focal line of a parabolic concentrator solar tracking system as an efficient solution. The developed device is experimentally examined under the climatic conditions of Ha'il city, Saudi Arabia. The results showed a significant enhancement in the performance of the developed device compared with the conventional single-effect device. The developed device increased the freshwater productivity and efficiency by 31.65% and 26.65%, respectively, with almost no increase in the freshwater production cost. A 5.2 L/m2day freshwater productivity was achieved with almost 40.4% daily thermal efficiency. Under the same operating conditions, the developed device presented 13%–50% higher productivity compared with the related published studies. The freshwater yield of the second effect was 25.8% of the total device yield, with a tube surface temperature of 73 °C compared with 88.6 °C for that of the single-effect device. This lower temperature along with the lower water mass in the second effect led to a significant decrease in the heat loss to the surrounding. It can be said that one square meter of the developed system can produce the essential freshwater needs per day for one person in rural and isolated communities.

Abstract: Germanium-based wide band gap kesterite semiconductor Cu2ZnGe(S,Se)4 (CZGeSSe) is considered a very promising absorber compound as top cell in tandem devices. Autonomy to tailor the band gap from ~1.47 eV (Cu2ZnGeSe4-CZGeSe) to ~2.2 eV (Cu2ZnGeS4-CZGeS), as well as non-toxic constituents makes this compound a strong candidate for further scientific exploration. However, the record efficiency of Cu2ZnGeSe4 solar cells is still significantly lower than those of its predecessors Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1-x)4 (CZTSSe), Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) and CdTe thin-film solar cells. The comprehensive understanding of the factors limiting the performance of Cu2ZnGeSe4 based solar cells is the purpose of this work, by combining a complete characterization of the morphological, structural, compositional and optoelectronic properties of Cu2ZnGeSe4 absorbers and devices. Besides, an in-depth investigation of the main limitations is carried out, specifically focusing on studying the origin of the large VOC deficit, the main recombination mechanisms, electric transport properties, band tails and possible Cu2ZnGeSe4/CdS band offset effects. The champion CZGeSe solar cell device reported in this work shows an efficiency of 6.5%, Voc of 606 mV, JSC of 17.8 mA/cm2 and FF of 60%. The results presented here demonstrate that the large voltage deficit of CZGeSe solar cells could be mainly ascribed to a Fermi level pinning at the interface, while modifications of the buffer layer to induce a “spike” at the p-n junction could be beneficial. Additionally, low carrier diffusion lengths and lifetimes, along with possible back contact recombination, are identified as the main culprits for the limited carrier collection for low-energy photons. Finally, some strategies are proposed to face and overcome most of these issues and to help improving the CZGeSe performance.

Abstract: Compared with traditional rigid perovskite solar cells fabricated on glass, flexible perovskite solar cells have a wider range of applications due to their lightweight and bendability, which have attracted great attention. Besides, carbon materials have shown some advantages of abundance, long-term stability and appropriate energy level as top electrode in perovskite solar cells. However, the reports of flexible devices based on carbon electrode are quite rare for the mismatch between the configuration of flexible perovskite solar cells and common carbon electrode techniques. Here, we introduce carbon film electrode into flexible perovskite solar cells for the first time. A new composite carbon film electrode is prepared on a highly conductive and flexible substrate of conductive cloth. Considerable PCEs of 15.37% and 14.05% have been obtained in small area (0.1 cm2) and large area (1 cm2) carbon based flexible devices, respectively. The comparable performance with standard Au electrode device, enhanced stability and suitability for roll-to-roll manufacturing reveals promising application of this low-cost composite carbon electrode.

Abstract: Sustainable utilization of solar energy with a more compact solar heating system is a significant research. In this study, a novel form-stable composite phase change material (PCM) was prepared for application in solar energy conversion and storage. Paraffin as PCM was encapsulated in the matrix consist of copper foam (CF) loaded with graphene aerogel (GA) in order to improve thermal conductivity, prevent leakage and convert solar energy to thermal energy. The melting temperature and the latent heat of the composite PCMs were determined to estimate thermal storage performance. The thermal conductivities of composite PCMs measured by transient plane heat source method were more than 9 times higher than that of paraffin. Besides, the composite PCMs showed uniform temperature distribution and perfect shape-stabilization when heated. Furthermore, the composite PCMs exhibited an excellent light-to-thermal energy conversion efficiency (up to 97%) in the experiment of light-to-thermal energy conversion, which demonstrated the potential of the composite PCM for solar energy conversion and storage.

Abstract: The oncoprotein c-Myc is a master transcription factor that regulates the expression of a large number of genes involved in cell cycle, cell growth, and cell metabolism. Hence, it is important to keep the level of c-Myc under control. There are many proteins responsible for the degradation of c-Myc. However, the deubiquitinase-mediated stabilization of c-Myc remains less well understood. In this study, we found that USP38, an ubiquitin-specific protease, regulates the levels and function of c-Myc. USP38 can inhibit the polyubiquitination of c-Myc, thereby increasing c-Myc stability. Functionally, USP38 is able to promote cell proliferation via a c-Myc dependent manner. Mechanistically, USP38 physically interacts with FBW7α and abolishes FBW7α-mediated degradation of c-Myc. Furthermore, USP38 can restore the inhibitory effect of FBW7α on proliferation. Taken together, our study uncovers a novel role for USP38 in the regulation of c-Myc abundance and stability.

Abstract: A major barrier to widespread use of solar energy remains: the need for storage to correct the mismatch between supply and demand. Herein, this paper prepared a flexible and resilient polyurethane film (m-Mn/PU) that could convert and store solar energy by compositing photothermal phase change microcapsules (microPCMs) coated with polydopamine (PDA) and waterborne polyurethane. The modified microPCMs (>225 J/g) were obtained via the surface deposition with PDA, and the m-Mn/PU films displayed desirable photothermal storage efficiency from 49.1% to 66.8%. It was found that incorporation of PDA improved the elongation at break of 50-Mn/PU films (>110 J/g) from 163% to 442% due to the favorable interaction of PDA-coated microPCMs with PU. The films also demonstrated the excellent thermal durability, photothermal cyclability and flexibility. The simple PDA deposition strategy could be adopted in making varieties of photothermal composites suitable for thermal energy management and solar energy collector system.

Abstract: This work presents a fast and accurate solar cell characterization method for determining the short-circuit current ISTC under standard test conditions. Additionally, the short-circuit current versus irradiance relation is derived, including accurately and precisely measured nonlinearities. Similar to the Differential Spectral Responsivity (DSR) method, our White Light Response (WLR) method uses a differential measurement technique with lock-in amplifiers. The first derivative of the short-circuit current versus irradiance relation (AM1.5-weighted differential responsivity) is measured at many irradiance levels without additional spectral mismatch corrections and considers the AM1.5 reference solar spectral irradiance distribution. The WLR method is significantly faster than the DSR method in determining the short-circuit current and nonlinearities. The highly spectrally nonlinear rear side of a bifacial PERC solar cell was investigated. The strong influence of the number of measured AM1.5-weighted differential responsivities and interpolation procedures on the short-circuit current ISTC is demonstrated. Finally, the accuracy of the results is discussed by means of a measurement comparison with the fully spectrally resolved DSR methods at PTB and CalLab PV Cells at ISE.

The liner must not be wetted by salt to maintain predictable thermal properties and manageable heat loss out of the tank. The commercial scale tank liner is an anchored brick and mortar design with expansion joints to accommodate thermal expansion. Finite element analysis is performed to optimize the thermal and mechanical profile of the tank. Equalizing the shell temperature between the water-cooled foundation and the shell wall is necessary to minimize differential thermomechanical stress and lower overall stress values below industrial allowable limits. The cost of the TES system is estimated to be $60/kWhth, which is four times greater than Department of Energy targets. Solutions to reduce system cost and overall risk are proposed.

Abstract: Photovoltaic devices based on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) absorbers are among the most attractive non-Si alternatives. The key to their steadily increasing efficiency is a post-deposition treatment (PDT) with alkali salts. For co-evaporated CIGSe, a RbF-PDT was demonstrated as the most efficient, however, the mechanism of the RbF influence on the CIGSe absorber is not completely understood. Here, we focus on the impact of RbF on the surface of co-evaporated CIGSe absorbers in dependence on their bulk composition. Surface-as well as bulk-sensitive methods with overlapping information depths are used to examine an overall depth profile of RbF-free and RbF-treated CIGSe samples with different Cu contents. We show a gradual depletion of copper towards the surface for the as-deposited CIGSe absorber layers. The following RbF-PDT sharpens this effect especially for the sample grown with the overall lower Cu content. Under the Cu-depleted surface layer, the composition of the CIGSe gradually changes until it reaches the respective bulk composition. As a result of the RbF-PDT, Ga diffuses towards the surface and Rb gets incorporated at the surface where GaF3 and RbInSe2 secondary phases are formed, respectively. A higher Cu content leads to less surface oriented Ga diffusion, less Rb incorporation and to a thinner RbInSe2 layer. A thinner RbInSe2 barrier layer, in turn, maintains the gain in open-circuit voltage and prevents the fill factor loss of the CIGSe device.

Abstract: Hybrid perovskites based solar cells have demonstrated high conversion efficiency but poor long-term stability. This study reports on the results obtained after doping the CH3NH3PbI2.6Cl0.4 mixed halide perovskite with imidazolium (C3N2H5+, denoted IM) on the “A site” position of a perovskite, to improve photovoltaic performances and stability of hybrid perovskite solar cells. The perovskite films were investigated exhaustively by different characterization techniques: X-ray diffraction, Atomic Force Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, UV–Vis, X-ray Photoelectron Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopies, Impedance Spectroscopy and Incident Photon-to-Electron Conversion Efficiency. The photovoltaic parameters were determined by measuring the IV curves of the corresponding solar cells. The amount of IM inserted in the perovskite play a key role on the film properties. The calculated new tolerance factors according to the "globularity factor" are experimentally proved and thus at doping concentrations greater than 20% for CH3NH3PbI2.6Cl0.4 perovskite the 3D structure is no longer obtained. However, below this value, the IM substituted perovskite film possesses an improved film quality and crystallinity as compared to the pristine film. Substituting MA+ with IM+ provides a favorable way to reduce recombination processes and shows great potential to achieve high stability, and an improved charge generation, resulting in increased PCE values. We find that the optimal percentage of imidazolium incorporation to achieve better stability of solar cells is 6%.

Abstract: We demonstrate solar steam generation with high evaporation rates and extraction of dry salts from solutions by using water-repellent germanium nanoparticles (GeNPs)-coated oxidized copper foams (CFs) as light absorbers and heat concentrators. The CF surface was first oxidized into black CuO, then dip-coated with colloidal GeNPs for enhancing infrared absorption, and lastly treated with perfluoroalkyl silane to render hydrophobicity. The CF can absorb more than 95% of the AM1.5G solar irradiance spectrum, for heating up a water-permeated cellulose paper underneath to generate steam which is then evacuated through the CF's interconnected pores. Furthermore, due to the CF's high thermal conductivity, the heat generated in the peripheral region can be efficiently concentrated to the center where the water evaporates. With the light-absorbing CF area about 7 times larger than the water-evaporating cellulose paper and the convective heat loss mitigated by an acrylic cover, under one sun solar irradiance, the CF temperature can reach 70 °C, resulting in an evaporation rate as high as 3.2 kg m−2 h−1. Moreover, when a NaCl solution is used for the heat-concentrating evaporation inside an enclosed system in which the water condensate is recycled, readily useful dry salts are formed and can be harvested from the hydrophobic CF surface, while the bulk solution is gradually desalinized.

Abstract: Dislocations induced by the misorientation between neighboring seeds severely damage the quality of the cast seed-assisted monocrystalline silicon (CSAM-Si) and its solar cell performance. Two experiments are designed to analyze the impact of seed orientation and functional grain boundary on the dislocation. It is found that the dislocation propagation is severely depending on the seed orientation, and the <110>-oriented seed could block the dislocation spread laterally. The large angle grain boundaries (LA-GBs) could absorb the initial dislocations and block its propagation. The average CSAM-Si solar cell efficiency can reach up to 21.8%, which is close to CZ-Si. Consequently, the dislocation slipping mechanism and functional grain boundary method could be used in industry for further improving CSAM-Si solar cell performance.

Abstract: The impairment of the CFTR channel activity, a cAMP-activated chloride (Cl−) channel responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF), has been associated with a variety of mitochondrial alterations such as modified gene expression, impairment in oxidative phosphorylation, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a disbalance in calcium homeostasis. The mechanisms by which these processes occur in CF are not fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated a reduced MTND4 expression and a failure in the mitochondrial complex I (mCx-I) activity in CF cells. Here we hypothesized that the activity of CFTR might modulate the mitochondrial fission/fusion balance, explaining the decreased mCx-I. The mitochondrial morphology and the levels of mitochondrial dynamic proteins MFN1 and DRP1 were analysed in IB3−1 CF cells, and S9 (IB3−1 expressing wt-CFTR), and C38 (IB3−1 expressing a truncated functional CFTR) cells. The mitochondrial morphology of IB3−1 cells compared to S9 and C38 cells showed that the impaired CFTR activity induced a fragmented mitochondrial network with increased rounded mitochondria and shorter branches. Similar results were obtained by using the CFTR pharmacological inhibitors CFTR(inh)-172 and GlyH101 on C38 cells. These morphological changes were accompanied by modifications in the levels of the mitochondrial dynamic proteins MFN1, DRP1, and p(616)-DRP1. IB3−1 CF cells treated with Mdivi-1, an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission, restored the mCx-I activity to values similar to those seen in S9 and C38 cells. These results suggest that the mitochondrial fission/fusion balance is regulated by the CFTR activity and might be a potential target to treat the impaired mCx-I activity in CF.

Abstract: Fluoride molten salts have a high melting point and latent heat of phase change, and can be used as a high-temperature phase-change heat-storage material. In this study, the Phase Diagram module of FactSage6.2 was used to calculate and draw the phase diagram of a quaternary fluoride salt system using two routes. The formulations meeting the melting-point requirement were further analyzed using the Equilib and Viscosity modules. We propose the “lowest liquid phase saturation point temperature–phase separation–viscosity” model to screen several sets of best experimental formulations. The experimental results prove the feasibility of the model, and the selected formulations offer the advantages of limited phase separation, good thermal stability, and high latent heat.

Abstract: Neurovascular coupling (NVC) represents the mechanisms whereby an increase in neuronal activity (NA) may lead to local vasodilation and increase in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). It has long been thought that neurons and astrocytes generate the vasoactive mediators regulating local changes in CBF, whereas cerebrovascular endothelial cells are not able to directly sense NA. Unexpectedly, recent evidence demonstrated that brain microvascular endothelial cells may sense NA through inward-rectifier K+ (Kir2.1) channels and may detect synaptic activity via N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs). In the present perspective, therefore, we discuss the hypothesis that endothelial Kir2.1 channels and NMDARs play a key role in NVC and in CBF regulation, which is crucial to unravel the cellular and molecular underpinnings of blood oxygen level-dependent signals.

Abstract: Objective
Intraoperative blood salvage (cell saver technique) in cardiac surgery is universally used in surgical procedures with a marked risk of blood loss. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the concentration of residual heparin in the final product that is reinfused into the patient in the operating room and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the cell saver technique.
Method
Twelve patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were enrolled in this study. Using the XTRA Autotransfusion System, blood samples were collected from the cardiotomy reservoir, both prior to blood processing (pre-sample) and after it, directly from the bag with processed product (post-sample). Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, the protein, albumin and residual heparin concentrations, hemolysis index, and the platelet, erythrocyte and leukocyte counts were measured.
Results
Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels and red blood cell counts were higher in post-processing samples, with a mean variation of 54.78%, 19.81g/dl and 6.84×106/mm3, respectively (p<0.001). The mean hematocrit of the processed bag was 63.49 g/dl (range: 57.2–67.5). The residual heparin levels were ≤0.1IU/ml in all post-treatment analyses (p=0.003). No related adverse events were observed.
Conclusion
The reduced residual heparin values (≤0.1IU/ml) in processed blood found in this study are extremely important, as they are consistent with the American Association of Blood Banks guidelines, which establish target values below 0.5IU/ml. The procedure was effective, safe and compliant with legal requirements and the available international literature.

Abstract: A new composite thermochemical heat storage (TcHS) material was proposed herein with good heat storage performance and desirable stability, which was prepared by using solid-state cold pressing with a zeolite molecular sieve (ZMS) and two salts (CaCl2 and MgSO4). First, the optimized mass content (CaCl2:MgSO4 = 6:4) denoted Smix was obtained, which represents an equilibrium between the adsorption capacity and deliquescence. Then, two types of ZMS porous media: 13X and NaY were added to Smix to further prevent deliquescence and improve stability, respectively. An orthogonal experiment with four factors (mass fraction, pressure, temperature, and humidity) and three levels was used to test the optimal preparation conditions, and the optimal configurations were obtained for Xopt (13X-ZMS: CaCl2: MgSO4 = 10: 54: 36) and Yopt (NaY-ZMS: CaCl2: MgSO4 = 20: 48: 32). The optimized samples were measured by SEM, XRD and thermal conductivity tests, and the adsorption capacities for Smix, Xopt, and Yopt were found to follow the order of Xopt (0.449 g/g) > Smix (0.374 g/g) > Yopt (0.335 g/g). The accumulated void formation for the porous media can promote heat and mass transfer and can significantly improve the adsorption capacity and avoid deliquescence. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showed that the heat storage density (HSD) for Xopt (1414.49 J/g) is higher than that for Yopt (1097.02 J/g). Finally, 20 cycles showed that Xopt has good cycle stability based on the normalized ad/desorption mass (>1) and normalized desorption heat (>0.8). The results showed that Xopt shows application potential as a TcHS composite material in medium- and low-temperature thermochemical adsorption heat storage systems.

Abstract: Sodium (Na) alkali doping is one of the effective ways to improve Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) device performance by passivating detrimental native defects caused by off-stoichiometric composition and Cu–Zn cationic disordering. Various methods to incorporate Na in CZTSe films have been considered to realize the ideal distribution of Na in CZTSe films. Na content, regardless of Na incorporation method, is significantly increased in bulk CZTSe. Interestingly, when a NaF precursor is supplied after CZTSe film growth, the surface Na content is slightly increased, resulting in improved device performance. For the first time, a sodium bifacial treatment was employed to obtain an optimal profile of Na in CZTSe films. Using this novel route for Na doping, the photovoltaic (PV) device exhibited a maximum efficiency of 6.02%, which was higher than that compared to CZTSe devices with single Na doping and CZTSe device with Na diffused from soda-lime glass. According to defect analyses, the improved device performance is associated with a reduction in the defect density from 1.1 × 1016 (without Na doing) to 5.7 × 1014 cm−3 (with optimal Na profile). These results indicate that the proposed bifacial treatment method is a desirable means to fabricate high-efficiency, flexible CZTSe solar cells.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel design of oxide-free and low-cost diffusion barrier layer to reduce the contamination from SiO2 crucible. The diffusion barrier layer consists of two Si3N4 layers and a middle layer of high purity Si powder. The diffusion barrier layer was applied for casting crystalline silicon with different types of seeds and the influence on impurity diffusion in crucible was analyzed. The results show that the diffusion barrier layer could effectively reduce the solid phase diffusion distance of metal impurities from crucible and significantly reduce the low minority carrier lifetime region at the bottom and edge of cast crystalline silicon ingot. Meanwhile, the performance of solar cells made of the wafers at the bottom and edge of ingots are obviously improved. Therefore, this non-oxide diffusion barrier layer could significantly improve ingot quality and increase ingot yield in industrial production.

Abstract: We report on the application of Bayesian optimization (BO), which could accelerate the time-intensive process optimization of many parameters, to fabrication of the high-performance titanium oxide/silicon oxide/crystalline silicon passivating contact. The process contains pre-deposition treatment to form SiOy interlayer, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of TiOx, and hydrogen plasma treatment (HPT) as post-process. We attempted to optimize seven parameters for ALD and HPT by dealing with samples treated by three kinds of chemical solutions in the same batch. This permits to perform BO for each structure at the same time and determine the superior pre-deposition treatment. Consequently, carrier selectivity S10 estimated by independent measurements of the saturation current density and contact resistance was significantly improved by BO of only 12 cycles and 10 initial random experiments. These results certify that BO could efficiently provide experimental conditions in multidimensional parameter space although we need to consider the impact of the metallization process on the passivation performance.

Abstract: Background
CD137 signaling is an essential factor in cell fate and atherosclerosis. An increase in the number of apoptotic macrophages accelerates atherosclerotic development involving mitochondrial dynamics.However, the role of CD137 signaling in macrophage apoptosis and changes in mitochondria has not been demonstrated clearly.
Methods and Results
Here, we used ApoE−/− mice as a model of atherosclerotic plaques. Mouse agonist anti-CD137 L and inhibitory anti-CD137 antibody were used to activate or block the CD137 signaling, respectively. Treatment of ApoE−/− mice with agonist anti-CD137 L promoted the formation of necrotic cores and macrophage apoptosis in plaques. Further, activation of CD137 signaling caused macrophage apoptosis in vitro, with upregulation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 expression and an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Meanwhile, CD137 signaling promoted mitochondrial fission observed by mitochondrial fragmentation. Interestingly, inhibition of mitochondrial dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) using Mdivi-1 reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and the amounts of apoptotic macrophages induced by CD137 signaling. Finally, we also found that the p38 MAPK pathway activated by CD137 signaling increased the expression of Drp1 expression and number of mitochondrial fragmented structures. Inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway by SB203580 attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction through reducing mitochondrial membrane potential loss, cytochrome c release, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.
Conclusions
Overall, we identify a novel mechanism whereby CD137 signaling induces macrophage apoptosis through promoting mitochondrial fission dependent on the p38 MAPK pathway.

Abstract: In this article, the growth of CuSCN nanorods and nanowires by changing the electrodeposition potential and time is presented. The dependency of growth of CuSCN nanostructures with applied potential and time is demonstrated. The inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated using thin films of electrodeposited CuSCN nanorods and nanowires. The maximum photovoltaic performance is observed with two dimensional (2D) nanorods grown for 3 min at all the applied potentials compared with other CuSCN nanostructures grown by various deposition time and potentials. The cone-shaped CuSCN nanorods grown at the applied potential of −450 mV delivers the highest photocurrent (Jsc = 21.11 mA/cm2) and power conversion efficiency (η = 12.42%) for the PSCs with the area of 0.75 cm2. The interrelation between the CuSCN nanostructures and photovoltaic performance is systemically investigated. The charge transfer resistance and the capacitive behaviour of CuSCN layers are analysed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The highest electron lifetime of 15.60 μs is observed for the PSCs fabricated with cone-shaped CuSCN nanorods grown at the applied potential of −450 mV for 3 min. The PSCs stability is tested under an open atmosphere with humidity >60% and retains 80% photovoltaic performance and stability for 50 days under atmospheric condition.

Abstract: The combination of lasers and solar cells has potential applications in many areas. Therefore, investigating the laser induced damage and defect formation in such cells is crucial. In this study, a Cu(In, Ga)Se2 solar cell was irradiated with a 532 nm continuous wave laser beam. The damage threshold power density with irradiation for 10 s was found to be approximately 5000 W/cm2 by analyzing the light current density–voltage curves and the variation of the solar cell efficiency after laser exposure. Further, absolute electroluminescence (EL) imaging with distributed circuit modeling was used to determine the laser induced defects. By simulating the measured injection current dependent EL intensities of the defect spots, the defects created by exposure to laser power densities less than 5000 W/cm2 could be mainly attributed to increased series resistance or increased transparent conductive oxide layer resistance, whereas those created by exposure to laser power densities greater than 5000 W/cm2 could be mainly attributed to decreased shunt resistance.

Abstract: Deliverability of controllable deposition processes represents the current state-of-the-art strategy for the development of emerging 1D crystal-structure photovoltaic (PV) materials. For Sb2Se3, a compound with tremendous potential for next-generation cost-efficient thin-film PV, the current reported findings proposed that columnar grain growth protocol is required to promote efficient carrier transport and to achieve highly efficient solar cells. It is still a matter of debate, however, whether the growth of the thin-film absorber should follow the weak contacted nanorod grain structure or the columnar-sintered large grain protocol, in relation with the processing temperature, the under-layer junction partner, and interface intermixing.

Abstract: Micro-photoluminescence is utilised in this work to study the shallow boron diffusions that occur underneath p + polysilicon passivating contacts. Regions with high boron concentrations emit a photoluminescence peak at a higher wavelength compared to the substrate crystalline silicon due to band-gap narrowing. We demonstrate the presence of this peak with samples following optimised fabrication procedures based on previous studies for thermally BBr3 diffused polysilicon passivating contacts. The intensities of the diffusion peaks, when normalised against the substrate crystalline silicon peak, change with the dopant concentration profiles, which in turn vary with the BBr3 diffusion temperatures as well as the thickness of the interfacial oxide layer. Comparisons are made between the photoluminescence spectra from p + polysilicon passivating contacts and n + polysilicon contacts reported previously [1]. We find that the sub-band-gap photoluminescence peaks arising from the n + polysilicon layers themselves are absent in the p + polysilicon contacts. This simplifies the procedure for photoluminescence spectra measurements in the case of p + polysilicon contacts. Further demonstration of micron-scale spectral photoluminescence mapping with localised p + polysilicon structures demonstrates the feasibility of the method in detecting underlying boron diffused regions with a spatial resolution of below 10 μm. Such micron-scale mapping will be useful for characterising localised polysilicon structures, such as polysilicon under the fingers on the front side of solar cells, or in interdigitated back contact devices.

Abstract: As perovskite solar cells (PSC) are now reaching high power conversion efficiencies, further performance improvement requires a fine management and harvesting optimization of light in the cells. These request an accurate understanding, characterization and modelling of the optical processes occurring within these complex, often textured, multi-layered systems. We consider here a typical methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) solar cell built on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode of high roughness. We used variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) to design a one-dimensional (1D) optical model of the stacked layers describing the rough texture as layers of effective-medium index. While most previous reports on PSC optical models performed ellipsometry only on single layers of each material independently deposited on glass, our model was obtained by an extensive ellipsometric analysis of the full stratified PSC structure at each deposition step. We support the 1D model using data extracted from scanning electron microscopy, diffuse spectroscopy and photovoltaic efficiency measurements and compare its results with full 3D simulations. Although the 1D model is insufficient to describe scattering by the FTO plate alone, it gives an accurate description of the full device optical properties. By comparison with the experimental external quantum efficiency (EQE), we estimate the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and the effect of the losses related to electron transfer. We finally discuss the optical losses mechanisms and possible strategies to improve light management and further increase PSC performances.

Abstract: Calcium looping process (CaL) is a promising thermochemical energy storage technology for the application in the 3rd generation concentrated solar power plants (CSP). Hence, it is necessary to develop the highly efficient CaO-based heat storage composite materials. The structurally improved, CaO-based pellets were prepared via adding cellulose as the pore-forming template. Furthermore, the approach of TiO2 incorporation was adopted aiming to enhance the anti-sintering ability of the structurally improved, CaO-based pellets. It is found that the structurally improved, TiO2-incorporated, CaO-based pellets that containing 25 wt% of TiO2 exhibit the highest CaO carbonation conversion and energy density of 57.5% and 1827.7 kJ/kg after 20 cycles, which are nearly 1.3 times as high as those of the pure Ca(OH)2 pellets. The superiority of the structurally improved, TiO2-incorporated, CaO-based pellets on cyclic heat energy storage/release is more prominent under harsh calcination conditions (950 °C, pure CO2). The evenly distributed CaTiO3 grains, providing structural stability to the CaO-based pellets and also enhancing the anti-sintering ability, are responsible for the improved cyclic energy storage/release performance. Additionally, the desirable compression strength (16.67 ± 1.05 MPa) contributes to strengthen the practicability of structurally improved, TiO2-incorporated, CaO-based pellets applied in the CaL-CSP system.

Abstract: Molten salts are considered as candidate heat transfer fluids and thermal energy storage media for next generation concentrating solar power (CSP). A molten salt circulates inside the piping and heat exchanger and also functions as a lubricant for the sleeve bearings of the CSP pump. Wear- and corrosion-resistant high-temperature bearing materials are critical for the pump efficiency and durability. This study evaluated the tribological performance of candidate bearing materials in lubrication of a molten chloride salt mixture (20% NaCl + 40% MgCl2 + 40% KCl) at 750 °C in an inert argon gas (a simulative CSP pump environment). Six ceramic-alloy pairs were tested, zirconia and silicon nitride against Haynes 244, Hastelloy C276, and Tribaloy T900 alloy, and ranked by the friction coefficient and wear loss. Characterization of worn surfaces suggested the wear mechanism as a combination of abrasion, adhesion, and tribocorrosion. Results from this study provide fundamental insight for the development and selection of bearing materials for molten salt powered CSP pumps.

Abstract: Solar cells made up of hybrid halide perovskites possess excellent power conversion efficiency due to the presence of remarkable optoelectronic properties of their photoactive layer. Herein, for the first time, we predict the ground state crystal structures of cyclopropenium metal iodide (C3H3MI3, (M = Sn, Pb)) in this class and discern their optoelectronic properties through first-principles calculations. Also, it is found that van der Waals interactions included ab initio calculations are essential for the correct prediction of the ground state crystal structure and their properties. Furthermore, the calculated formation energy values confirm their phase stability. Also, from COHP analyses we have characterized the nature of the bonding and antibonding states present in these materials. Our electronic structural studies reveal their semiconducting behavior with a direct band gap of 0.452 eV and 1.733 eV, when M is Sn and Pb, respectively. The calculated carrier effective mass values imply that C3H3SnI3 has high carrier mobility than C3H3PbI3, and their absorption coefficient peak values are same, but is shifted to higher energy value for C3H3PbI3 than C3H3SnI3 due to the increase in its band gap value. However, the calculated power conversion efficiency show that C3H3PbI3 than C3H3SnI3 will be more promising material for solar cell applications.

Abstract: The window layers limit the performance of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells with front and back contacts. Here, we optimized tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO) film deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The opto-electrical properties of the IWO were manipulated when deposited on top of thin-film silicon layers. The optimal IWO on glass shows carrier density and mobility of 2.1 × 1020 cm−3 and 34 cm2 V−1s−1, respectively, which were tuned to 2.0 × 1020 cm−3 and 47 cm2 V−1s−1, as well as 1.9 × 1020 cm−3 and 42 cm2 V−1s−1, after treated on i/n/glass and i/p/glass substrates, respectively. Using the more realistic TCO data that were obtained on thin-film silicon stacks, optical simulation indicates a promising visible-to-near-infrared optical response in IWO-based SHJ device structure, which was demonstrated in fabricated devices. Additionally, by adding an additional magnesium fluoride layer on device, the champion IWO-based SHJ device showed an active area cell efficiency of 22.92%, which is an absolute 0.98% efficiency gain compared to the ITO counterpart, mainly due to its current gain of 1.48 mA/cm2.

Abstract: Luminescence and thermography have proven to be effective tools for the detection of failure modes and defects in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS)-based photovoltaic (PV) devices. However, the chemical and physical origin of many of the features observed with these techniques are still unclear. This makes it difficult to asses their impact on device performance and lifetime. Here, features were identified in CIGS cells using spatial photoluminescence (PL), electroluminescence (EL), illuminated lock-in thermography (ILIT) and dark lock-in thermography (DLIT). Localized features were studied using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and confocal microscopy. The most commonly observed features could be associated with three different origins. Firstly, TCO sheet resistance resulting in a gradient in the direction of current flow was visible in each sample. For samples with high TCO sheet resistance this compromised detection of other features in EL. Secondly, about half of the detected features corresponded to areas of exposed molybdenum resulting in dark spots in PL and EL. These occurred in shunted and non-shunted form, with only the former causing hotspots in thermography. Thirdly, ohmic shunts induced by current-injection (current-induced shunts) were found to form large hotspots in ILIT and DLIT and a significant drop in luminescence intensity in EL and PL. Localized features in luminescence were only observed for the largest current-induced shunts as clear bright spots in PL and clear dark spots in EL. The results from this study contribute to the distinction of different defect types in modules using exclusively luminescence and thermography imaging techniques.

Abstract: Ceramic-metal nanocomposites (NCs) are the one of the most promising materials for selective solar absorbers (SSAs) in renewable energy applications. Design of efficient SSAs demands precise modeling of light propagation in NCs. We report on the synthesis, detailed characterization, and analytical and numerical modeling of Molybdenum (Mo)-alumina (Al2O3) NCs. In this study, Mo–Al2O3 NC films with thicknesses of 45 nm and 60 nm and nominal metal volume fraction (f) of 30%, 40%, and 60% were grown on polished glass substrates, using sequential DC and RF sputtering. TEM analysis of the samples with f = 40% showed that most 2 nm-diameter Mo particles are spherical and isolated. The reflectance (R) and transmittance (T) curves of the NC were measured in the spectral range of 300 nm and 1700 nm. The measured R and T characteristics were compared with the calculated FDTD simulations to analyze the prediction accuracy of the approach.

Abstract: Directly absorbing sunlight and on-site storing thermal energy via phase change processes are promising to achieve efficient and fast solar-to-thermal energy storage. However, the performance is severely inhibited by intrinsically low thermal conductivity and poor optical absorption capability of phase change materials (PCMs). We propose a strategy to achieve integrated efficient solar-to-thermal conversion and ultrafast energy storage by developing nacre-like ceramics embedded with titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles (NPs) contained PCMs. A high thermal conductivity of 25.63 W m−1 K−1 compatible with large phase change enthalpy of 157.93 kJ/kg are demonstrated. The excellent performance is attributed to ordered arrangement of silicon carbide ceramics and erythritol PCMs, just like microstructure of natural nacre. Meanwhile, the solar absorptance is improved by exciting localized plasmon resonances of TiN NPs in a broad band. Combination of high thermally conductive biomimetic skeletons with volumetric absorptive PCMs leads to a prominent enhancement of solar-to-thermal energy storage rate by 864%. This work paves a way for the application of ceramics in rapid and efficient solar energy harvesting and thermal energy storage.

Abstract: As a new type of refrigeration technique, radiative cooling can reduce the temperature of the object without consuming energy, thus, exhibiting a significant development prospect. However, due to the long-term exposure of the surface to the outdoor environment, the particles deposited on the surface affect the radiative cooling performance. In this study, a radiative cooling multilayer film with self-cleaning function has been proposed. The top surface has been designed and manufactured by employing a mixture of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and SiO2 particles with different particle sizes and proportions to achieve the self-cleaning character. The bottom surface is composed of PDMS and Al films. Further, the transfer matrix method has been used in this study to optimize the combination and thickness of the bottom PDMS and Al films, and the FDTD method has been used to optimize the SiO2 particle size, volume fraction and coating thickness. Finally, the thickness of the bottom PDMS layer has been optimized to 40 μm, with the SiO2 particle sizes of 0.04 μm and 0.1 μm and the coating thickness of 40 μm, based on which the theoretical net cooling power calculations and experimental trials have been carried out. The calculation results show that the net cooling power can reach 59.04 W/m2 under the conditions of the American standard atmospheric model, and the difference in the net cooling power under the two different atmospheric model conditions is 24.36 W/m2. The experimental results also reveal that the maximum temperature of the object can be reduced by 2.1 °C during the day and 3.44 °C at night, with the maximum surface contact angle reaching up to 164.45°. In addition to the achievement of radiative cooling, the developed film possesses an optimal self-cleaning performance and can effectively reduce the maintenance cost during operation. In addition, the preparation process is simple and inexpensive, thus, exhibiting the high potential of real-life applications.

Abstract: The introduction of ozonated deionized water (DIO3 water) to the silicon wafer wet cleaning process has attracted interest from the photovoltaic industry. In this work, a simple and cost-effective approach to fabricate submicron-texture multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafer is presented using Ag metal-catalyzed chemical etching (MCCE) in DIO3/HF solution, where DIO3 was used as a hole injecting agent. The submicron-texture was successfully applied to fabricate efficient mc-Si PERC solar cells with an average efficiency of 20.31%, which is 0.58%abs higher than those with an acid micron-texture and exceeds those with conventional MCCE submicron-textures using H2O2 as the hole injecting agent. We demonstrated that using DIO3 as a hole injection agent in metal-catalyzed chemical etching is feasible. This novel MCCE approach is simple, low-cost, and ecofriendly, making it an attractive alternative to conventional MCCE methods for use in industrial-scale production.

Abstract: The results of the optimization of antireflection films of TiO2 nanotubes on GaAs solar cells, non-encapsulated and encapsulated, are presented. The ARC forms a bilayer of porous TiO2 over a dense bottom. The films were prepared on Si and GaAs substrates via a versatile electrochemical anodization process which produces films with good optical performance. The thicknesses and porosity of the ARC were optimized numerically with a method based on maximizing the short circuit current. Using experimental indices, the minimum Rw was 1.81% for the non-encapsulated case. For the encapsulated case, the lowest Rw was 2.34%, where the porosity of the top layer was adjusted in addition to the thicknesses. In simulations of a GaAs solar cell, the addition of the optimized ARC resulted in a Jsc increase of 43.6% for the non-encapsulated case, and 36.7% for the encapsulated case.

Abstract: A nanostructured micro-prism array (MPA) was integrated onto a solar module consisting of multiple perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) to minimize optical losses from surface reflection and the inactive areas reserved for interconnection. The MPA structure redirects light that is incident on inactive areas onto active sub-cell areas to improve the light harvesting efficiency. The nanoscale sub-wavelength structures (SWSs) minimize the surface reflection at the surface of the PeSC module. Combining the technical advantages of these two structures, the MPA decorated with nanoscale SWSs improves the performance of the PeSC module. The short circuit current of the PeSC module employing the MPA decorated with nanoscale SWSs was improved by 1.4 mA/cm2 compared to a conventional PeSC module covered with bare glass.

Abstract: The role of the spleen in sepsis is still controversial. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the spleen on sepsis-induced immune dysfunction in C57BL/6 mice subjected to caecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Changes in different immune cells and apoptotic cells in the spleen and peripheral blood were observed 4, 24 and 48 h after CLP. Then, we determined that 48 h following CLP was the most significant period of immunosuppression. Next, we divided the mice into four groups: control, CLP, CLP + spx (splenectomy 48 h after CLP) and spx + CLP (splenectomy surgery two weeks before CLP). Compared with the CLP mice, the CLP + spx and spx + CLP mice had improved survival rates and organ injuries, increased expression of inflammatory factors, a decreased proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and reduced expression of the genes involved in the programmed cell death 1 and its ligand 1 (PD1-PDL1) pathway in immune cells and T-cell immunoglobulin-mucin domain 3 (Tim 3) and Galectin9 in the liver and lungs after 72 h in late-phase sepsis. In addition, the expression of PD-1 was significantly reduced in T cells in spx + CLP mice, and the expression of PD-L1 in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) was reduced in the CLP + spx group, especially in macrophages. These findings suggested that splenectomy could protect septic mice from exhaustion of immune cells by reducing the proliferation of Treg cells and expression of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in immune cells during the immunosuppressive stage of sepsis. Splenectomy could also reduce liver and lung injuries possibly via the Tim 3 and/or Galectin-9 axis. The spleen is an important regulator of the occurrence and development of sepsis, which provides a new perspective to improve the prognosis of sepsis by regulating the spleen.

Abstract: Passive radiative cooling has been spotlighted as a method to solve environmental problems and fuel depletion. Therefore, various radiative coolers have been studied and applied to lower the surface temperatures of objects such as roof, building exterior, solar cells, and automobiles without any external energy. Furthermore, recently, the research scope of radiative cooling is expanded to enclosed spaces, which is not limited to object cooling. Especially, a Janus emitter (JET) which has selective and broadband emission on the separated sides, helps drawing the heat from enclosures efficiently. Using JET enables better cooling of enclosed space in hot weather than conventional emitter, which considers the only emissivity of top side, however, the cooling capability in some cases, that cooling is not required (i.e., night and winter), should be demonstrated for practical applications. This study analyzes the space cooling performance of JET in hot and cool conditions (e.g., day and night). The cooling tendencies with different sizes of enclosed space were also confirmed by heat transfer analysis. Furthermore, systematic experiments with various sized emitters demonstrate the space cooling capability of JET in different conditions (i.e., temperature and volume). These successful demonstrations prove the thermal-managing property of JET regardless of chamber volumes.

Abstract: Molten salt corrosion in the receiver's piping system and storage tanks is still one of the major drawbacks of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants and is currently covered by using expensive high-alloyed steels or Ni-base alloys. The employment of cheaper structural materials combined with protective coatings is an attractive alternative to increase cost-efficiency. The present study investigates the corrosion resistance of three different coatings (a pure Ni, a Cr and a combined Ni + Cr coating) deposited on ferritic-martensitic X20CrMoV12-1 steel during isothermal immersion in molten solar salt in comparison to uncoated Ni-base alloy Haynes 230. Exposure tests were conducted at 600 °C for up to 1000 h. To identify the individual role of the main elements, exposure tests of pure Fe, Ni and Cr were undertaken as well. In addition to the cross-sectional investigations via light-optical microscopy and EPMA, X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted to identify the corrosion products. These were complemented by weight change measurements and chemical analysis of the salts after the exposure tests. The study reveals differences between the corrosion behaviour of the different coating approaches, which is discussed as a function of coating composition and degradation mechanisms. Whereas pure Cr or pure Ni coatings offer hardly any improved protection of the uncoated X20CrMoV12-1 substrate, the combined Ni + Cr coating performs very well and improves the scaling behaviour of X20CrMoV12-1 significantly. The outcome highlights the correlation between the solubility of the pure metals Fe, Ni and Cr in molten solar salt and the corrosion resistance of the investigated coatings.

Abstract: A Glass-to-Glass (G2G) CuInxGa1-xSe2 (CIGS) solar cell module is a promising thin-film solar technology; however, it is highly sensitive to moisture-induced degradation. Many studies have been conducted on the lifetime prediction model of this technology. However, none of these studies considered the spatial effects of moisture propagation on degradation. This study introduced a novel method, the spatially distributed diode model (SDDM), and predicted the lifetime of G2G CIGS solar modules for moisture-induced degradation. We analyzed the diffusion of spatial moisture concentration on the CIGS solar modules and estimated the model parameters using degradation data. The proposed method can predict the lifetime of any size or shape of G2G CIGS module for moisture-induced degradation. Furthermore, the method can be used to envision a possible longer lifetime for the solar modules depending on the selection of physical appearance of the modules and installation location.

Abstract: The thermodynamic calculation for the quaternary Mg(NO3)2–KNO3–NaNO3–LiNO3 system was performed based on the CALPHAD approach to design novel magnesium nitrate-based molten salts with low melting temperatures. Thermodynamic evaluations and optimizations of the Mg(NO3)2–NaNO3, Mg(NO3)2–LiNO3, and Mg(NO3)2–KNO3 systems were critically carried out in this study. The modified quasi–chemical model (MQM) was used to describe the liquid phases, and the double salt 2KNO3·Mg(NO3)2 was treated as a stoichiometric compound. The self-consistent thermodynamic database for the quaternary Mg(NO3)2–KNO3–NaNO3–LiNO3 system was established. For this quaternary system and its magnesium nitrate-based ternary subsystems, the phase diagrams were calculated using the Kohler-Toop and Kohler interpolation techniques, and the calculated eutectic points were experimentally verified by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results show that the experimentally-measured melting temperatures of these eutectic points are consistent with the calculated values. The thermophysical properties of these eutectic mixtures, including the enthalpy of fusion, the specific heat capacity and the thermal stability, were further determined through thermal analysis. Two novel magnesium nitrate-based eutectic mixtures are expected to serve as potential heat transfer and storage material candidates applied in the medium and high temperatures–thermal energy storage.

Abstract: Screen-printed contacts to doped polysilicon (poly-Si) layers with high-temperature fire-through pastes is one of the key enablers for widespread industrial acceptance of passivating contact solar cells. In recent years, rapid progress has been made in the development of pastes for contacting doped poly-Si layers. However, there are still gaps in understanding the behavior of fire-through contacts, especially regarding damage to poly-Si layers. In this work we present a comprehensive study of metal contacts formed with fire-through pastes to both phosphorus-doped (n+) poly-Si and boron-doped (p+) poly-Si layers. The contacts are fired at different temperatures and characterized by evaluating specific contact resistivity and recombination current density under the metal contacts. The metal crystallites formed at the interface between metal fingers and poly-Si is quantitatively analyzed to determine their area fraction. It is observed that the area fraction of the crystallites tends to saturate at higher temperatures for n + poly-Si, however such behavior is not observed for p + poly-Si within the range of firing temperatures relevant for industrial solar cells. Metal crystallites appear to agglomerate at higher temperatures for contacts to both n+ and p + poly-Si layers which explains increased recombination due to aggressive etching of poly-Si. For Ag contacts to n + poly-Si best results are achieved when the metal crystallites covered 50% of the surface area at the optimum firing temperature. For Ag–Al contacts to p + poly-Si the crystallites covered 30% of the area, but resulted in higher recombination under the contacts. n-type bifacial solar cells are fabricated with n + poly-Si passivating contacts on the rear side and fired at different temperatures. The solar cell results followed the trends shown by the contacts and efficiency reached maximum for an optimized firing temperature. However, the change in efficiency was dominated by the front side contact characteristics. The results obtained on solar cells validate the observations about contact formation and metal recombination.
