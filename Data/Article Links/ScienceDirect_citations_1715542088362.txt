Abstract: Summary
Some strains of the protozoan parasite Leishmania guyanensis (L.g) harbor a viral endosymbiont called Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1). LRV1 recognition by TLR-3 increases parasite burden and lesion swelling in vivo. However, the mechanisms by which anti-viral innate immune responses affect parasitic infection are largely unknown. Upon investigating the mammalian host’s response to LRV1, we found that miR-155 was singularly and strongly upregulated in macrophages infected with LRV1+ L.g when compared to LRV1− L.g. LRV1-driven miR-155 expression was dependent on TLR-3/TRIF signaling. Furthermore, LRV1-induced TLR-3 activation promoted parasite persistence by enhancing macrophage survival through Akt activation in a manner partially dependent on miR-155. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt resulted in a decrease in LRV1-mediated macrophage survival and consequently decreased parasite persistence. Consistent with these data, miR-155-deficient mice showed a drastic decrease in LRV1-induced disease severity, and lesional macrophages from these mice displayed reduced levels of Akt phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Tau, an important pathological protein of Alzheimer's disease (AD), can mediate the toxicity of amyloid β (Aβ). Thus, reduction of Tau with chemical molecules may offer a novel strategy for treating AD. Here, we designed and synthesized a series of multifunctional molecules that contained Tau-recognition moieties and E3 ligase-binding moieties to enhance Tau degradation. Among these molecules, TH006 had the highest activity of inducing Tau degradation by increasing its poly-ubiquitination. The decrement in Tau induced by TH006 could decrease the cytotoxicity caused by Aβ. Furthermore, TH006 could regulate the Tau level in the brain of an AD mouse model. Therefore, partial reduction of Tau with such multifunctional peptides may open up a novel therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Allografts of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells have been considered for the treatment of ocular diseases. We recently started the transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE cells for patients with age-related macular degeneration (autogenic grafts). However, there are at least two problems with this approach: (1) high cost, and (2) uselessness for acute patients. To resolve these issues, we established RPE cells from induced iPSCs in HLA homozygote donors. In vitro, human T cells directly recognized allogeneic iPSC-derived RPE cells that expressed HLA class I/II antigens. However, these T cells failed to respond to HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1-matched iPSC-derived RPE cells from HLA homozygous donors. Because of the lack of T cell response to iPSC-derived RPE cells from HLA homozygous donors, we can use these allogeneic iPSC-derived RPE cells in future clinical trials if the recipient and donor are HLA matched.

Abstract: Delayed clearance of free form all-trans-retinal (atRAL) is estimated be the key cause of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells injury during the pathogenesis of retinopathies such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are far from clear. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity effect and underlying molecular mechanism of atRAL on human retinal pigment epithelium ARPE-19 cells. The results indicated that atRAL could cause cell dysfunction by inducing oxidative and nitrosative stresses in ARPE-19 cells. The oxidative stress induced by atRAL was mediated through up-regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, activating mitochondrial-dependent and MAPKs signaling pathways, and finally resulting in apoptosis of ARPE-19 cells. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin could partly attenuated ROS generation, indicating that NADPH oxidase activity was involved in atRAL-induced oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells. The nitrosative stress induced by atRAL was mainly reflected in increasing nitric oxide (NO) production, enhancing iNOS, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expressions, and promoting monocyte adhesion. Furthermore, above effects could be dramatically blocked by using a nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) inhibitor SN50, indicated that atRAL-induced oxidative and nitrosative stresses were mediated by NF-κB. The results provide better understanding of atRAL-induced toxicity in human RPE cells.

Synergistic effect of atorvastatin and Cyanidin-3-glucoside on angiotensin II-induced inflammation in vascular smooth muscle cells,

Abstract: Statins have often been used in atherosclerosis treatment because of its pleiotropic effects on inflammation. However, some adverse effects of high doses of statin show reverse effects after withdrawal. Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is a powerful anti-inflammation and antioxidant that has been of interest for use in combination with low doses of statin, which may be alternative treatment for atherosclerosis. The objective is to investigate the synergistic effect of atorvastatin and C3G in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced inflammation in vascular smooth muscle cells. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were exposed to Ang II with or without atorvastatin and C3G alone, or in combination. The results revealed that the combination of atorvastatin and C3G produces synergism against inflammation and oxidative stress. The mechanism of the combination of atorvastatin and C3G suppressed the translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB from cytosol to nucleus, and attenuated the expression of proteins including inducible nitric oxide synthase, intracellular adhesion molecule 1(ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1(VCAM-1), in addition to nitric oxide (NO) production. Moreover, C3G exerts the antioxidative properties of atorvastatin through down-regulating NOX1 and promoting the activity of the Nrf2−ARE signaling pathway and downstream proteins including heme oxygenase (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinoneoxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (γ-GCLC), besides increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes. Taken together, these results suggest that a combination of low dose statins and C3G might serve as a potential regulator of the atherosclerosis process which is mediated by attenuating oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting NF-κB and activating Nrf2 signaling pathways induced by Ang II.

Abstract: Summary
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human-adapted pathogen that encounters terminally sialylated glycoconjugates and free sialic acid (Sia) in the airways. Upon scavenging by the bacterial sialidase NanA, Sias serve as carbon sources for the bacteria. Unlike most animals in which cytidine-monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) converts Sia N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) into N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), humans have an inactive CMAH, causing an absence of Neu5Gc and excess Neu5Ac. We find that pneumococcal challenge in Cmah−/− mice leads to heightened bacterial loads, virulence, and NanA expression. In vitro, NanA is upregulated in response to Neu5Ac compared with Neu5Gc, a process controlled by the two-component response regulator CiaR and requiring Sia uptake by the transporter SatABC. Additionally, compared with Neu5Gc, Neu5Ac increases pneumococcal resistance to antimicrobial reactive oxygen species in a CiaR-dependent manner. Thus, S. pneumoniae senses and responds to Neu5Ac, leading to CiaR activation and increased virulence and potentially explaining the greater susceptibility in humans.

Abstract: The vitamin D receptor (VDR), and its ligand 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) prevent breast cancer development and progression, yet the molecular mechanisms governing this are unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) on the other hand, promote or inhibit breast cancer growth. To understand how VDR regulates miRNAs, we compared miRNA expression of wild-type (WT) and VDR knockout (VDRKO) breast cancer cells by a Mouse Breast Cancer miRNA PCR array. Compared to VDR WT cells, expressions of miR-214, miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p of the miR-199a/miR-214 cluster were 42, 15, and 10 fold higher in VDRKO cells respectively. Overexpression of VDR in breast cancer cells reduced the miR-199a/miR-214 cluster expression by 30%. VDR status also negatively correlated with Dnm3os expression, a non-coding RNA transcript of the dynamin-3 gene encoding the miR-199a/miR-214 cluster, suggesting that VDR represses this cluster through Dnm3os. Conversely, overexpression of miR-214 in MCF-7 and T47D cells antagonized VDR mediated signaling. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between VDR status and the expression of Suppressor of fused gene (SuFu), a hedgehog pathway inhibitor. miR-214 on the other hand suppressed SuFu protein expression. These findings suggest a crosstalk between VDR and miR-214 in regulating hedgehog signaling in breast cancer cells, providing new therapies for breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-specific proteomics in multicellular systems and whole animals is a promising approach to understand the differentiated functions of cells and tissues. Here, we extend our stochastic orthogonal recoding of translation (SORT) approach for the co-translational tagging of proteomes with a cyclopropene-containing amino acid in response to diverse codons in genetically targeted cells, and create a tetrazine-biotin probe containing a cleavable linker that offers a way to enrich and identify tagged proteins. We demonstrate that SORT with enrichment, SORT-E, efficiently recovers and enriches SORT tagged proteins and enables specific identification of enriched proteins via mass spectrometry, including low-abundance proteins. We show that tagging at distinct codons enriches overlapping, but distinct sets of proteins, suggesting that tagging at more than one codon enhances proteome coverage. Using SORT-E, we accomplish cell-specific proteomics in the fly. These results suggest that SORT-E will enable the definition of cell-specific proteomes in animals during development, disease progression, and learning and memory.

Abstract: Summary
The transcriptional activator PrfA, a member of the Crp/Fnr family, controls the expression of some key virulence factors necessary for infection by the human bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Phenotypic screening identified ring-fused 2-pyridone molecules that at low micromolar concentrations attenuate L. monocytogenes cellular uptake by reducing the expression of virulence genes. These inhibitors bind the transcriptional regulator PrfA and decrease its affinity for the consensus DNA-binding site. Structural characterization of this interaction revealed that one of the ring-fused 2-pyridones, compound 1, binds at two separate sites on the protein: one within a hydrophobic pocket or tunnel, located between the C- and N-terminal domains of PrfA, and the second in the vicinity of the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif. At both sites the compound interacts with residues important for PrfA activation and helix-turn-helix formation. Ring-fused 2-pyridones represent a new class of chemical probes for studying virulence in L. monocytogenes.

Abstract: Many studies have been performed to assess the potential utility of natural products as immunomodulatory agents to enhance host responses against infection or to ameliorate immune-based pathologies. To determine whether eriodictyol has immunomodulatory effects and clarify which types of immune effector cells are stimulated in vitro, we investigated the stimulatory effect of eriodictyol on spleen cells isolated from BALB/c mice. Eriodictyol significantly stimulated splenocyte proliferation. However, only B lymphocytes (not T lymphocytes) could be stimulated by eriodictyol in a dose-related manner. Studies assessing potential effect of eriodictyol on innate immunity reported that eriodictyol enhanced significantly the killing activity of natural killer (NK) cells, T lymphocytes, and macrophages. We also demonstrated that eriodictyol inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production and lysosomal enzyme activity in murine peritoneal macrophages cultured ex-vivo, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory effect in situ. Eriodictyol revealed also a cellular anti-oxidant activity in splenocytes and macrophages. Furthermore, eriodictyol increased catalase activity in spleen cells. From this data, it can be concluded that eriodictyol exhibited an immunomodulatory effect that could be ascribed in part to a cytoprotective effect related to its anti-oxidant activity.

Abstract: Summary
The intracellular microbial nucleic acid sensors, TLR3 and STING, recognize pathogen molecules and signal to activate the interferon pathway. The TIR-domain containing protein TRIF is the sole adaptor of TLR3. Here, we report an essential role for TRIF in STING signaling: various activators of STING could not induce genes in the absence of TRIF. TRIF and STING interacted directly, through their carboxy-terminal domains, to promote STING dimerization, intermembrane translocation, and signaling. Herpes simplex virus (HSV), which triggers the STING signaling pathway and is controlled by it, replicated more efficiently in the absence of TRIF, and HSV-infected TRIF−/− mice displayed pronounced pathology. Our results indicate that defective STING signaling may be responsible for the observed genetic association between TRIF mutations and herpes simplex encephalitis in patients.

Abstract: Hypernomic secretion of epithelial cytokines has several effects on stromal cells. The contributions of inflammatory epithelial cells to stromal fibroblasts in bovine mammary glands with mastitis remain poorly understood. Here, we established an inflammatory epithelial cell model of bovine mastitis with gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and gram-positive lipoteichoic acid (LTA) bacterial cell wall components. We characterized immune responses of mammary stromal fibroblasts induced by inflammatory epithelial cells. Our results showed that inflammatory epithelial cells affected stromal fibroblast characteristics by increasing inflammatory mediator expression, elevating extracellular matrix protein deposition, decreasing proliferation capacity, and enhancing migration ability. The changes in stromal fibroblast proliferation and migration abilities were mediated by signal molecules, such as WNT signal pathway components. LPS- and LTA-induced inflammatory epithelial cells triggered different immune responses in stromal fibroblasts. Thus, in mastitis, bovine mammary gland stromal fibroblasts were affected by inflammatory epithelial cells and displayed inflammation-specific changes, suggesting that fibroblasts play crucial roles in bovine mastitis.

Abstract: Summary
AIDS caused by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection is associated with gastrointestinal disease, systemic immune activation, and, in cross-sectional studies, changes in the enteric virome. Here we performed a longitudinal study of a vaccine cohort to define the natural history of changes in the fecal metagenome in SIV-infected monkeys. Matched rhesus macaques were either uninfected or intrarectally challenged with SIV, with a subset receiving the Ad26 vaccine, an adenovirus vector expressing the viral Env/Gag/Pol antigens. Progression of SIV infection to AIDS was associated with increased detection of potentially pathogenic viruses and bacterial enteropathogens. Specifically, adenoviruses were associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal disease and AIDS-related mortality. Viral and bacterial enteropathogens were largely absent from animals protected by the vaccine. These data suggest that the SIV-associated gastrointestinal disease is associated with the presence of both viral and bacterial enteropathogens and that protection against SIV infection by vaccination prevents enteropathogen emergence.

Abstract: Summary
The dermal Panniculus carnosus (PC) muscle is important for wound contraction in lower mammals and represents an interesting model of muscle regeneration due to its high cell turnover. The resident satellite cells (the bona fide muscle stem cells) remain poorly characterized. Here we analyzed PC satellite cells with regard to developmental origin and purported function. Lineage tracing shows that they originate in Myf5+, Pax3/Pax7+ cell populations. Skin and muscle wounding increased PC myofiber turnover, with the satellite cell progeny being involved in muscle regeneration but with no detectable contribution to the wound-bed myofibroblasts. Since hematopoietic stem cells fuse to PC myofibers in the absence of injury, we also studied the contribution of bone marrow-derived cells to the PC satellite cell compartment, demonstrating that cells of donor origin are capable of repopulating the PC muscle stem cell niche after irradiation and bone marrow transplantation but may not fully acquire the relevant myogenic commitment.

Abstract: Free fatty acids (FFAs) are dietary nutrients which mediate a variety of biological effects through binding to G-protein-coupled FFA receptors (FFARs). G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) and GPR40 are identified as FFARs for long- and medium-chain fatty acids. Here we investigated whether GPR120 and GPR40 are involved in the acquisition of malignant properties in lung cancer cells. Three lung cancer RLCNR, LL/2 and A549 cells used in this study expressed GPR120 and GPR40 genes. The cell motile activities of all cells were significantly suppressed by a GPR40 antagonist GW1100. In addition, GPR40 knockdown inhibited the cell motile activity of A549 cells. In gelatin zymography, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity in GPR40 knockdown was significantly lower than that in control cells. Next, to evaluate effects of GPR120 and GPR40 on cellular functions induced by anti-cancer drug, the long-term cisplatin (CDDP) treated (A549-CDDP) cells were generated. The expression levels of GPR120 and GPR40 were significantly decreased in A549-CDDP cells. While A549-CDDP cells showed the high cell motile activity, GW1100 suppressed the cell motile activity of A549-CDDP cells. These results demonstrate that GPR120 negatively and GPR40 positively regulate cellular functions during tumor progression in lung cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Phenotypic drug discovery offers some advantages over target-based methods, mainly because it allows drug leads to be tested in systems that more closely model distinct disease states. However, a potential disadvantage is the difficulty of linking the observed phenotype to a specific cellular target. To address this problem, we developed DePick, a computational target de-convolution tool to determine targets specifically linked to small-molecule phenotypic screens. We applied DePick to eight publicly available screens and predicted 59 drug target-phenotype associations. In addition to literature-based evidence for our predictions, we provide experimental support for seven predicted associations. Interestingly, our analysis led to the discovery of a previously unrecognized connection between the Wnt signaling pathway and an aromatase, CYP19A1. These results demonstrate that the DePick approach can not only accelerate target de-convolution but also aid in discovery of new functionally relevant biological relationships.

Abstract: Inflammatory response played an important role in the progression of spinal cord injury (SCI). Several miRNAs were associated with the pathology of SCI. However, the molecular mechanism of miRNA involving in inflammatory response in acute SCI (ASCI) was poorly understood. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into 2 groups: control group (n=6) and acute SCI (ASCI) group (n=6). The expression of miR-199b and IκB kinase β-nuclear factor-kappa B (IKKβ-NF-κB) signaling pathway were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) in rats with ASCI and in primary microglia activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that downregulation of miR-199b and activation of IKKβ/NF-κB were observed in rats after ASCI and in activated microglia. miR-199b negatively regulated IKKβ by targeting its 3′- untranslated regions (UTR) through using luciferase reporter assay. Overexpression of miR-199b reversed the up-regulation of IKKβ, p-p65, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in LPS-treated BV2 cells assessed by western blotting analysis. In addition, BMS-345541 reversed the up-regulation effects of miR-199b inhibitor on the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β. In the SCI rats, overexpression of miR-199b attenuated ASCI and decreased the expression of IKKβ-NF-κB signaling pathway and TNF-α and IL-1β. These results indicated that miR-199b attenuated ASCI at least partly through IKKβ-NF-κB signaling pathway and affecting the function of microglia. Our findings suggest that miR-199b may be employed as therapeutic for spinal cord injury.

Abstract: Summary
There is an ongoing controversy as to whether major histocompatibility complex (MHC) matching is a solution for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In the present study, we established retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in MHC homozygote donors. We observed no rejection signs in iPSC-derived RPE allografts of MHC-matched animal models without immunosuppression, whereas there were immune attacks around the graft and retinal tissue damage in MHC-mismatched models. In an immunohistochemical examination of MHC-mismatched allografts, the transplanted RPE sheets/cells were located in the subretinal space, but the RPE exhibited inflammatory and hypertrophic changes, and many inflammatory cells, e.g., Iba1+ cells, MHC class II+ cells, and CD3+ T cells, invaded the graft area. Conversely, these inflammatory cells poorly infiltrated the area around the transplanted retina if MHC-matched allografts were used. Thus, cells derived from MHC homozygous donors could be used to treat retinal diseases in histocompatible recipients.

Abstract: Cells change their morphology as a response to environmental cues. The quantitative evaluation of single cell spread on extracellular matrices, such as type I collagen, is a key tool in cancer research. Inherent to the manual scoring of cellular spread is inter-observer but also intra-observer variation. To overcome these problems, we have developed the Morphology Analysis Software (MAS). MAS scores phase-contrast images of cells on native type I collagen gels and identifies whether a cell has a spread or round morphology using a combination of four unique parameters: the presence of a cellular extension, the cell area, the cell eccentricity and cell circularity. The MAS software scores are equivalent to the average score of five independent observers but MAS is faster, more objective and standardized. A functional screening assay using six cytokines identified TGFα as a stimulator of HCT8/E11 and SK-BR-3 single cell spreading on top of type I collagen gels. This change in morphology correlates with increased migration potential as evidenced by xCELLigence migration assays and are counteracted by EGFR signaling pathway inhibitors. This underscores the use of morphology classification on a population of unlabeled cells as read-out of an important cancer cell property and the potential for the MAS software in drug screening strategies.

Abstract: In the present study, we combined stem cell technology with a non-absorbable biomaterial for the reconstruction of the ruptured ACL. Towards this purpose, multipotential stromal cells derived either from subcutaneous human adipose tissue (hAT-MSCs) or from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from human foreskin fibroblasts (hiPSC-MSCs) were cultured on the biomaterial for 21days in vitro to generate a 3D bioartifical ACL graft. Stem cell differentiation towards bone and ligament at the ends and central part of the biomaterial was selectively induced using either BMP-2/FGF-2 or TGF-β/FGF-2 combinations, respectively. The bioartificial ACL graft was subsequently implanted in a swine ACL rupture model in place of the surgically removed normal ACL. Four months post-implantation, the tissue engineered ACL graft generated an ACL-like tissue exhibiting morphological and biochemical characteristics resembling those of normal ACL.

Abstract: Summary
With no antiviral drugs or widely available vaccines, Dengue virus (DENV) constitutes a public health concern. DENV replicates at ER-derived cytoplasmic structures that include substructures called convoluted membranes (CMs); however, the purpose of these membrane alterations remains unclear. We determine that DENV nonstructural protein (NS)4B, a promising drug target with unknown function, associates with mitochondrial proteins and alters mitochondria morphology to promote infection. During infection, NS4B induces elongation of mitochondria, which physically contact CMs. This restructuring compromises the integrity of mitochondria-associated membranes, sites of ER-mitochondria interface critical for innate immune signaling. The spatio-temporal parameters of CM biogenesis and mitochondria elongation are linked to loss of activation of the fission factor Dynamin-Related Protein-1. Mitochondria elongation promotes DENV replication and alleviates RIG-I-dependent activation of interferon responses. As Zika virus infection induces similar mitochondria elongation, this perturbation may protect DENV and related viruses from innate immunity and create a favorable replicative environment.

Abstract: Apoptosis of neural cells is one of the main pathological features in hypoxic/ischemic brain injury. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) might be a potential therapeutic target for hypoxic/ischemic brain injury since NF-κB has been found to be inactivated after hypoxia exposure, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms of NF-κB inactivation are largely unknown. Here we report that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation prevents neuron-like PC12 cells apoptosis in response to hypoxia via restoring NF-κB-dependent transcriptional upregulation of cyclin D1. Functionally, EGFR activation by EGF stimulation mitigates hypoxia-induced PC12 cells apoptosis in both dose- and time-dependent manner. Of note, EGFR activation elevates IKKβ phosphorylation, increases IκBα ubiquitination, promotes P65 nuclear translocation and recruitment at cyclin D1 gene promoter as well as upregulates cyclin D1 expression. EGFR activation also abrogates the decrease of IKKβ phosphorylation, reduction of IκBα ubiquitination, blockade of P65 nuclear translocation and recruitment at cyclin D1 gene promoter as well as downregulation of cyclin D1 expression induced by hypoxia. Furthermore, NF-κB-dependent upregulation of cyclin D1 is instrumental for the EGFR-mediated cytoprotection against hypoxic apoptosis. In addition, the dephosphorylation of EGFR induced by either EGF siRNA transfection or anti-HB-EGF neutralization antibody treatment enhances hypoxic cytotoxicity, which are attenuated by EGF administration. Our results highlight the essential role of NF-κB-dependent transcriptional upregulation of cyclin D1 in EGFR-mediated cytoprotective effects under hypoxic preconditioning and support further investigation of EGF in clinical trials of patients with hypoxic/ischemic brain injury.

Abstract: Summary
Embryoid body (EB) formation and adherent culture (AD) paradigms are equivalently thought to be applicable for neural specification of human pluripotent stem cells. Here, we report that sonic hedgehog-induced ventral neuroprogenitors under EB conditions are fated to medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), while the AD cells mostly adopt a floor-plate (FP) fate. The EB-MGE later on differentiates into GABA and cholinergic neurons, while the AD-FP favors dopaminergic neuron specification. Distinct developmental, metabolic, and adhesion traits in AD and EB cells may potentially account for their differential patterning potency. Gene targeting combined with small-molecule screening experiments identified that concomitant inhibition of Wnts, STAT3, and p38 pathways (3i) could largely convert FP to MGE under AD conditions. Thus, differentiation paradigms and signaling regulators can be integrated together to specify distinct neuronal subtypes for studying and treating related neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Summary
Infections with Clostridium difficile increasingly cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. Bacterial surface glycans including lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were identified as auspicious vaccine antigens to prevent colonization. Here, we report on the potential of synthetic LTA glycans as vaccine candidates. We identified LTA-specific antibodies in the blood of C. difficile patients. Therefore, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a semi-synthetic LTA-CRM197 glycoconjugate. The conjugate elicited LTA-specific antibodies in mice that recognized natural LTA epitopes on the surface of C. difficile bacteria and inhibited intestinal colonization of C. difficile in mice in vivo. Our findings underscore the promise of synthetic LTA glycans as C. difficile vaccine candidates.

Abstract: Chronic stress is a risk factor in the development of cognitive decline and even Alzheimer’s disease (AD), although its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Our previous data demonstrated that the level of homocysteine (Hcy) was significantly elevated in the plasma of stressed animals, which suggests the possibility that Hcy is a link between stress and cognitive decline. To test this hypothesis, we compared the cognitive function, plasma concentrations of Hcy, and the brain beta-amyloid (Aβ) level between rats with or without chronic unexpected mild stress (CUMS). A lower performance by rats in behavioral tests indicated that a significant cognitive decline was induced by CUMS. Stress also disturbed the normal processing of Aβ precursor protein (APP) and resulted in the accumulation of Aβ in the brains of rats, which showed a positive correlation with the hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) that appeared in stressed rats. Hcy-targeting intervention experiments were used to verify further the involvement of Hcy in stress-induced APP misprocessing and related cognitive decline. The results showed that diet-induced HHcy could mimic the cognitive impairment and APP misprocessing in the same manner as CUMS, while Hcy reduction by means of vitamin B complex supplements and betaine could alleviate the cognitive deficits and dysregulation of Aβ metabolism in CUMS rats. Taken together, the novel evidence from our present study suggests that Hcy is likely to be involved in chronic stress-evoked APP misprocessing and related cognitive deficits. Our results also suggested the possibility of Hcy as a target for therapy and the potential value of vitamin B and betaine intake in the prevention of stress-induced cognitive decline.

Abstract: Summary
EWS-FLI1, a multi-functional fusion oncogene, is exclusively detected in Ewing sarcomas. However, previous studies reported that rare varieties of osteosarcomas also harbor EWS-ETS family fusion. Here, using the doxycycline-inducible EWS-FLI1 system, we established an EWS-FLI1-dependent osteosarcoma model from murine bone marrow stromal cells. We revealed that the withdrawal of EWS-FLI1 expression enhances the osteogenic differentiation of sarcoma cells, leading to mature bone formation. Taking advantage of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, we also show that sarcoma-derived iPSCs with cancer-related genetic abnormalities exhibited an impaired differentiation program of osteogenic lineage irrespective of the EWS-FLI1 expression. Finally, we demonstrate that EWS-FLI1 contributed to secondary sarcoma development from the sarcoma iPSCs after osteogenic differentiation. These findings demonstrate that modulating cellular differentiation is a fundamental principle of EWS-FLI1-induced osteosarcoma development. This in vitro cancer model using sarcoma iPSCs should provide a unique platform for dissecting relationships between the cancer genome and cellular differentiation.

Abstract: EHD3 is localized on the tubular structures of early endosomes, and it regulates their trafficking pathway. However, the regulatory mechanism of EHD3-containing tubular structures remains poorly understood. An in vitro liposome co-sedimentation assay revealed that EHD3 interacted with phosphatidic acid through its helical domain and this interaction induced liposomal tubulations. Additionally, inhibiting phosphatidic acid synthesis with diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor or lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase inhibitor significantly reduced the number of EHD3-containing tubules and impaired their trafficking from early endosomes. These results suggest that EHD3 and phosphatidic acid cooperatively regulate membrane deformation and trafficking from early endosomes.

Abstract: Pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) enhances the risk of fetal neurodevelopmental defects. However, the mechanism of hyperglycaemia-induced neurodevelopmental defects is not fully understood. In this study, several typical neurodevelopmental defects were identified in the streptozotocin-induced diabetes mouse model. The neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin/forkhead box P1-labelled neuronal differentiation was suppressed and glial fibrillary acidic protein-labelled glial cell lineage differentiation was slightly promoted in pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) mice. Various concentrations of glucose did not change the U87 cell viability, but glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor expression was altered with varying glucose concentrations. Mouse maternal hyperglycaemia significantly increased Tunel+ apoptosis but did not dramatically affect PCNA+ cell proliferation in the process. To determine the cause of increased apoptosis, we determined the SOD activity, the expression of Nrf2 as well as its downstream anti-oxidative factors NQO1 and HO1, and found that all of them significantly increased in PGDM fetal brains compared with controls. However, Nrf2 expression in U87 cells was not significantly changed by different glucose concentrations. In mouse telencephalon, we observed the co-localization of Tuj-1 and Nrf2 expression in neurons, and down-regulating of Nrf2 in SH-SY5Y cells altered the viability of SH-SY5Y cells exposed to high glucose concentrations. Taken together, the data suggest that Nrf2-modulated antioxidant stress plays a crucial role in maternal hyperglycaemia-induced neurodevelopmental defects.

Abstract: Electrospinning is a technique widely used for tissue engineering. Despite hurdles, electrospun vascular tissue scaffolds has shown great promise in in vitro studies. One problem is the removal of tubular scaffolds from a electrospinning collection device with no unwanted crumpling or tearing, especially for small diameter scaffolds. To tackle this problem we designed a collection device for simple removal of the scaffold from the collector while no chemical pretreatment was required. The scaffolds fabricated on this collecting device maintained their tubular structure and showed favorable surface properties, mechanical strength and biocompatibility. The device offers a new opportunity for tissue engineering researchers to fabricate tubular scaffolds from materials which have not been possible to date and help them improve the quality of synthesized scaffolds.

Abstract: Summary
Self-renewal and differentiation of neural stem cells is essential for embryonic neurogenesis, which is associated with cell autophagy. However, the mechanism by which autophagy regulates neurogenesis remains undefined. Here, we show that Eva1a/Tmem166, an autophagy-related gene, regulates neural stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Eva1a depletion impaired the generation of newborn neurons, both in vivo and in vitro. Conversely, overexpression of EVA1A enhanced newborn neuron generation and maturation. Moreover, Eva1a depletion activated the PIK3CA-AKT axis, leading to the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin and the subsequent inhibition of autophagy. Furthermore, addition of methylpyruvate to the culture during neural stem cell differentiation rescued the defective embryonic neurogenesis induced by Eva1a depletion, suggesting that energy availability is a significant factor in embryonic neurogenesis. Collectively, these data demonstrated that EVA1A regulates embryonic neurogenesis by modulating autophagy. Our results have potential implications for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders caused by autophagy dysregulation.

Abstract: Loss-of-function studies have identified Porcupine (PORCN) and Wntless (WLS) as essential mediators of Wnt secretion and signaling. Whereas PORCN is thought to palmitoylate Wnt proteins, WLS is believed to transport palmitoylated Wnt proteins to the cell surface. However, little is known about how these two proteins cooperate to regulate Wnt palmitoylation, trafficking, secretion, and signaling. We first investigated possible interactions between PORCN, WLS, and WNT1, by carrying out co-immunoprecipitation studies. These studies demonstrate the existence of a complex containing PORCN and WLS. They further show that PORCN and WLS compete for binding to WNT1. Then, we used gain-of-function studies to investigate the cooperation between PORCN and WLS as well as possible biochemical interactions between PORCN, WLS, and WNT1. Consistent with the proposed roles for PORCN and WLS, we show that overexpression of PORCN promotes palmitoylation of WNT1 while overexpression of WLS does not. Overexpression of PORCN enhances the ability of WLS to promote WNT1 trafficking to the cell surface as well as secretion, but decreases the ability of WLS to activate WNT1 signaling in target cell. These observations suggest that the levels of WNT1 on the cell surface and in the media are not the sole determinants of the activation of Wnt signaling in target cells.

Abstract: Summary
A cardiomyocyte differentiation in vitro system from zebrafish embryos remains to be established. Here, we have determined pluripotency window of zebrafish embryos by analyzing their gene-expression patterns of pluripotency factors together with markers of three germ layers, and have found that zebrafish undergoes a very narrow period of pluripotency maintenance from zygotic genome activation to a brief moment after oblong stage. Based on the pluripotency and a combination of appropriate conditions, we established a rapid and efficient method for cardiomyocyte generation in vitro from primary embryonic cells. The induced cardiomyocytes differentiated into functional and specific cardiomyocyte subtypes. Notably, these in vitro generated cardiomyocytes exhibited typical contractile kinetics and electrophysiological features. The system provides a new paradigm of cardiomyocyte differentiation from primary embryonic cells in zebrafish. The technology provides a new platform for the study of heart development and regeneration, in addition to drug discovery, disease modeling, and assessment of cardiotoxic agents.

Abstract: Caspase-8 expression is lost in a small percentage of tumors suggesting that the retention of its functionality may positively contribute to tumor progression. Consistently, several non-apoptotic functions of Caspase-8 have been identified and Caspase-8 has been shown to modulate cell adhesion, migration and to promote tumor progression. We have previously identified the Src-dependent phosphorylation of Caspase-8 on Tyr380 as a molecular mechanism to downregulate the proapoptotic function of Caspase-8; this phosphorylation occurs in colon cancer and may promote cell migration in neuroblastoma cell lines. However, the occurrence of Caspase-8 phosphorylation on Tyr380 and its significance in different carcinoma cellular models, have not been clarified yet. Here we show that Caspase-8 expression may promote cell transformation in glioblastoma and in hepatocarcinoma cell lines. In these systems Caspase-8 is phosphorylated on Tyr380 in a Src kinase dependent manner and this phosphorylation is required for transformation and it is enhanced by hypoxic conditions. Using a cancer cellular model characterized by Src constitutive activation engineered to express either Caspase-8-wt or Caspase-8-Y380F we could show that Caspase-8 expression and its phosphorylation on Tyr380, but not its enzymatic activity, promote in vitro cell transformation and resistance to anoikis. This work demonstrates a dual role for Caspase-8 in cancer, suggesting that Tyr380 phosphorylation may represent a molecular switch to hijack its activity from tumor suppressor to tumor promoter.

Abstract: Summary
Allostery is a phenomenon observed in many proteins where binding of a macromolecular partner or a small-molecule ligand at one location leads to specific perturbations at a site not in direct contact with the region where the binding occurs. The list of proteins under allosteric regulation includes AGC protein kinases. AGC kinases have a conserved allosteric site, the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)-interacting fragment (PIF) pocket, which regulates protein ATP-binding, activity, and interaction with substrates. In this study, we identify small molecules that bind to the ATP-binding site and affect the PIF pocket of AGC kinase family members, PDK1 and Aurora kinase. We describe the mechanistic details and show that although PDK1 and Aurora kinase inhibitors bind to the conserved ATP-binding site, they differentially modulate physiological interactions at the PIF-pocket site. Our work outlines a strategy for developing bidirectional small-molecule allosteric modulators of protein kinases and other signaling proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Pattern recognition receptors are activated following infection and trigger transcriptional programs important for host defense. Tight regulation of NF-κB activation is critical to avoid detrimental and misbalanced responses. We describe Pickle, a Drosophila nuclear IκB that integrates signaling inputs from both the Imd and Toll pathways by skewing the transcriptional output of the NF-κB dimer repertoire. Pickle interacts with the NF-κB protein Relish and the histone deacetylase dHDAC1, selectively repressing Relish homodimers while leaving other NF-κB dimer combinations unscathed. Pickle’s ability to selectively inhibit Relish homodimer activity contributes to proper host immunity and organismal health. Although loss of pickle results in hyper-induction of Relish target genes and improved host resistance to pathogenic bacteria in the short term, chronic inactivation of pickle causes loss of immune tolerance and shortened lifespan. Pickle therefore allows balanced immune responses that protect from pathogenic microbes while permitting the establishment of beneficial commensal host-microbe relationships.

Abstract: TNF-α is known to induce osteoblasts apoptosis, whereas mechanical stimulation has been shown to enhance osteoblast survival. In the present study, we found that mechanical stimulation in the form of fluid shear stress (FSS) suppresses TNF-α induced apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that has been implicated in cell survival. We also demonstrated that FSS imposed by flow chamber in vitro leads to a markedly activation of ERK5, which was shown to be protective against TNF-α-induced apoptosis, whereas the transfection of siRNA against ERK5 (ERK5-siRNA) reversed the FSS-medicated anti-apoptotic effects. An initial FSS-mediated activation of ERK5 that phosphorylates AKT to increase its activity, and a following forkhead box O 3a (FoxO3a) was phosphorylated by activated AKT. Phosphorylated FoxO3a is sequestered in the cytoplasm, and prevents it from translocating to nucleus where it can increase the expression of FasL and Bim. The inhibition of AKT-FoxO3a signalings by a PI3K (PI3-kinase)/AKT inhibitor (LY294002) or the transfection of ERK5-siRNA led to the nuclear translocation of non-phosphorylated FoxO3a, and increased the protein expression of FasL and Bim. In addition, the activation of caspase-3 by TNF-α was significantly inhibited by aforementioned FSS-medicated mechanisms. In brief, the activation of ERK5-AKT-FoxO3a signaling pathways by FSS resulted in a decreased expression of FasL and Bim and an inhibition of caspase-3 activation, which exerts a protective effect that prevents osteoblasts from apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra; however, the mechanism of neurodegeneration in PD remains unclear. A subset of familial PD is linked to mutations in PARK2 and PINK1, which lead to dysfunctional mitochondria-related proteins Parkin and PINK1, suggesting that pathways implicated in these monogenic forms could play a more general role in PD. We demonstrate that the identification of disease-related phenotypes in PD-patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons depends on the type of differentiation protocol utilized. In a floor-plate-based but not a neural-rosette-based directed differentiation strategy, iPSC-derived mDA neurons recapitulate PD phenotypes, including pathogenic protein accumulation, cell-type-specific vulnerability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and abnormal neurotransmitter homeostasis. We propose that these form a pathogenic loop that contributes to disease. Our study illustrates the promise of iPSC technology for examining PD pathogenesis and identifying therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Blood vessels are formed through vasculogenesis, followed by remodeling of the endothelial network through angiogenesis. Many events that occur during embryonic vascular development are recapitulated during adult neoangiogenesis, which is critical to tumor growth and metastasis. Current antiangiogenic tumor therapies, based largely on targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway, show limited clinical benefits, thus necessitating the discovery of alternative targets. Here we report the development of a robust embryonic stem cell-based vascular differentiation assay amenable to small-molecule screens to identify novel modulators of angiogenesis. In this context, RSK and TTK were identified as angiogenic modulators. Inhibition of these pathways inhibited angiogenesis in embryoid bodies and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, inhibition of RSK and TTK reduced tumor growth, vascular density, and improved survival in an in vivo Lewis lung carcinoma mouse model. Our study suggests that RSK and TTK are potential targets for antiangiogenic therapy, and provides an assay system for further pathway screens.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is frequently diagnosed in men, and dysregulation of microRNAs is characteristic of many cancers. MicroRNA-1207-3p is encoded at the non-protein coding gene locus PVT1 on the 8q24 human chromosomal region, an established PCa susceptibility locus. However, the role of microRNA-1207-3p in PCa is unclear. We discovered that microRNA-1207-3p is significantly underexpressed in PCa cell lines in comparison to normal prostate epithelial cells. Increased expression of microRNA-1207-3p in PCa cells significantly inhibits proliferation, migration, and induces apoptosis via direct molecular targeting of FNDC1, a protein which contains a conserved protein domain of fibronectin (FN1). FNDC1, FN1, and the androgen receptor (AR) are significantly overexpressed in PCa cell lines and human PCa, and positively correlate with aggressive PCa. Prostate tumor FN1 expression in patients that experienced PCa-specific death is significantly higher than in patients that remained alive. Furthermore, FNDC1, FN1 and AR are concomitantly overexpressed in metastatic PCa. Consequently, these studies have revealed a novel microRNA-1207-3p/FNDC1/FN1/AR regulatory pathway in PCa.

Abstract: Summary
Controlled differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be utilized for precise analysis of cell type identities during early development. We established a highly efficient neural induction strategy and an improved analytical platform, and determined proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of hESCs and their specified multipotent neural stem cell derivatives (hNSCs). This quantitative dataset (nearly 13,000 proteins and 60,000 phosphorylation sites) provides unique molecular insights into pluripotency and neural lineage entry. Systems-level comparative analysis of proteins (e.g., transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, kinase families), phosphorylation sites, and numerous biological pathways allowed the identification of distinct signatures in pluripotent and multipotent cells. Furthermore, as predicted by the dataset, we functionally validated an autocrine/paracrine mechanism by demonstrating that the secreted protein midkine is a regulator of neural specification.

Abstract: The disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and endothelial cell dysfunction, associated with the cerebrovascular deposition of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein, have been characterized as the key pathological characteristics in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In various biologic processes of AD, researchers have proven that mircroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles. However, the role and function of miRNAs in the disruption of BBB of AD still remain unclear. Here, we found that mircroRNA-107 (miR-107) is endogenously expressed in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) of BBB model, while it is significantly down-regulated in ECs pre-incubated with Abeta. Abeta significantly impairs the integrity, increases the permeability of BBB, inhibits the viability of endothelial cells (ECs), and meanwhile down-regulates the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1, Occludin and Claudin-5. Overexpression of miR-107 largely abrogated Abeta-induced disruption of BBB and endothelial cell dysfunction. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-107 also down-regulates endophilin-1, which is involved in the regulation of BBB permeability and the expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-5. Both bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that Endophilin-1 was a direct and functional downstream target of miR-107. In conclusion, our results indicate that overexpression of miR-107 is able to prevent Abeta-induced blood-brain barrier disruption and endothelial cell dysfunction by targeting endophilin-1.

Abstract: In many pathological conditions the endothelium becomes activated and dysfunctional, resulting in hyperpermeability and plasma leakage. No specific therapies are available yet to control endothelial barrier function, which is regulated by inter-endothelial junctions and the generation of acto-myosin-based contractile forces in the context of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. However, the spatiotemporal distribution and stimulus-induced reorganization of these integral forces remain largely unknown. Traction force microscopy of human endothelial monolayers was used to visualize contractile forces in resting cells and during thrombin-induced hyperpermeability. Simultaneously, information about endothelial monolayer integrity, adherens junctions and cytoskeletal proteins (F-actin) were captured. This revealed a heterogeneous distribution of traction forces, with nuclear areas showing lower and cell-cell junctions higher traction forces than the whole-monolayer average. Moreover, junctional forces were asymmetrically distributed among neighboring cells. Force vector orientation analysis showed a good correlation with the alignment of F-actin and revealed contractile forces in newly formed filopodia and lamellipodia-like protrusions within the monolayer. Finally, unstable areas, showing high force fluctuations within the monolayer were prone to form inter-endothelial gaps upon stimulation with thrombin. To conclude, contractile traction forces are heterogeneously distributed within endothelial monolayers and force instability, rather than force magnitude, predicts the stimulus-induced formation of intercellular gaps.

Abstract: Polycystins 1 and 2, which are mutated in Autosomal Polycystic Kidney Disease, are involved in mechanotransduction through various mechanisms. In renal cells, polycystins not only have an important mechanotransductive role in primary cilia but are also present in intercellular contacts but their role there remains unclear. Here, we address the hypothesis that polycystins are involved in mechanotransduction via intercellular junctions, which would be expected to have consequences on tissue organization. We focused on the role of polycystin 2, which could be involved in mechanical organization at junctions either by its channel activity or by the direct recruitment of cytoskeleton components such as the F-actin cross-linker α-actinin. After mechanical stimulation of intercellular junctions in MDCK renal epithelial cells, α-actinin is rapidly recruited but this is inhibited upon overexpression of PC2 or the D509V mutant that lacks channel activity, and is also decreased upon PC2 silencing. This suggests that a precise dosage of PC2 is necessary for an adequate mechanosensitive α-actinin recruitment at junctions. At the multicellular level, a change in PC2 expression was associated with changes in velocity in confluent epithelia and during wound healing together with a loss of orientation. This study suggests that the mechanosensitive regulation of cytoskeleton by polycystins in intercellular contacts may be important in the context of ADPKD.

Abstract: Although chemical inhibition of the DNA damage response (DDR) in cancer cells triggers cell death, it is not clear if the fork blockade achieved with inhibitors that neutralise proteins of the replisome is sufficient on its own to overcome the DDR. Monoclonal antibodies to PCNA, which block the DNA elongation process in vitro, have been developed. When these antibodies were transduced into cancer cells, they are able to inhibit the incorporation of nucleoside analogues. When co-delivered with anti-PCNA siRNA, the cells were flattened and the size of their nuclei increased by up to 3-fold, prior to cell death. Analysis of these nuclei by super-resolution microscopy revealed the presence of large numbers of phosphorylated histone H2AX foci. A senescence-like phenotype of the transduced cells was also observed upon delivery of the corresponding Fab molecules or following PCNA gene disruption or when the Fab fragment of an antibody that neutralises DNA polymerase alpha was used. Primary melanoma cells and leukaemia cells that are resistant to chemical inhibitors were similarly affected by these antibody treatments. These results demonstrate that transduced antibodies can trigger a lethal DNA replication stress, which kills cancer cells by abolishing the biological activity of several constituents of the replisome.

Abstract: Summary
Approximately half of all deaths from liver cirrhosis, the tenth leading cause of mortality in the United States, are related to alcohol use. Chronic alcohol consumption is accompanied by intestinal dysbiosis and bacterial overgrowth, yet little is known about the factors that alter the microbial composition or their contribution to liver disease. We previously associated chronic alcohol consumption with lower intestinal levels of the antimicrobial-regenerating islet-derived (REG)-3 lectins. Here, we demonstrate that intestinal deficiency in REG3B or REG3G increases numbers of mucosa-associated bacteria and enhances bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and liver, promoting the progression of ethanol-induced fatty liver disease toward steatohepatitis. Overexpression of Reg3g in intestinal epithelial cells restricts bacterial colonization of mucosal surfaces, reduces bacterial translocation, and protects mice from alcohol-induced steatohepatitis. Thus, alcohol appears to impair control of the mucosa-associated microbiota, and subsequent breach of the mucosal barrier facilitates progression of alcoholic liver disease.

Abstract: The continuous growth of mouse incisors depends on epithelial stem cells (SCs) residing in the SC niche, called labial cervical loop (LaCL). The homeostasis of the SCs is subtly regulated by complex signaling networks. In this study, we focus on retinoic acid (RA), a derivative of Vitamin A and a known pivotal signaling molecule in controlling the functions of stem cells (SCs). We analyzed the expression profiles of several key molecules of the RA signaling pathway in cultured incisor explants upon exogenous RA treatment. The expression patterns of these molecules suggested a negative feedback regulation of RA signaling in the developing incisor. We demonstrated that exogenous RA had negative effects on incisor SCs and that this was accompanied by downregulation of Fgf10, a mesenchymally expressed SC survival factor in the mouse incisor. Supplement of Fgf10 in incisor cultures completely blocked RA effects by antagonizing apoptosis and increasing proliferation in LaCL epithelial SCs. In addition, Fgf10 obviously antagonized RA-induced downregulation of the SC marker Sox2 in incisor epithelial SCs. Our findings suggest that the negative effects of RA on incisor SCs result from inhibition of mesenchymal Fgf10.

Abstract: Summary
Complex antigens require processing within antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to form T cell stimulatory complexes with CD1 antigen-presenting molecules. It remains unknown whether lipids with multi-acylated moieties also necessitate digestion by lipases to become capable of binding CD1 molecules and stimulate T cells. Here, we show that the mycobacterial tetra-acylated glycolipid antigens phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIM) are digested to di-acylated forms by pancreatic lipase-related protein 2 (PLRP2) and lysosomal phospholipase A2 (LPLA2) within APCs. Recombinant PLRP2 and LPLA2 removed the sn1- and sn2-bound fatty acids from the PIM glycerol moiety, as revealed by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance studies. PLRP2 or LPLA2 gene silencing in APCs abolished PIM presentation to T cells, thus revealing an essential role of both lipases in vivo. These findings show that endosomal lipases participate in lipid antigen presentation by processing lipid antigens and have a role in T cell immunity against mycobacteria.

Abstract: Summary
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based executioner caspase reporters using GFP are important tools for imaging apoptosis. While these reporters are useful for imaging apoptosis in cultured cells, their in vivo application has been handicapped by poor signal to noise. Here, we report the design and characterization of a GFP-based fluorogenic protease reporter, dubbed ZipGFP. ZipGFP-based TEV protease reporter increased fluorescence 10-fold after activation by protease. A ZipGFP-based executioner caspase reporter visualized apoptosis in live zebrafish embryos with spatiotemporal resolution. Thus, the ZipGFP-based caspase reporter may be useful for monitoring apoptosis during animal development and for designing reporters of proteases beyond the executioner caspases.

Abstract: Summary
Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that inhabits the upper gastrointestinal tract in humans, and the presence of this pathogen in the gut microbiome increases the risk of peptic ulcers and stomach cancer. H. pylori depends on unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) biosynthesis for maintaining membrane structure and function. Although some of the H. pylori enzymes involved in UFA biosynthesis are functionally homologous with the enzymes found in Escherichia coli, we show here that an enzyme HP0773, now annotated as FabX, uses an unprecedented backtracking mechanism to not only dehydrogenate decanoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) in a reaction that parallels that of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, the first enzyme of the fatty acid β-oxidation cycle, but also isomerizes trans-2-decenoyl-ACP to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP, the key UFA synthetic intermediate. Thus, FabX reverses the normal fatty acid synthesis cycle in H. pylori at the C10 stage. Overall, this unusual FabX activity may offer a broader explanation for how many bacteria that lack the canonical pathway enzymes produce UFA-containing phospholipids.

Abstract: Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) are an important source of stem cells for tissue repair and regeneration; therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate stem cell differentiation into a specific lineage is critical. The NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway and autophagy promote cell survival in response to oxidative stress. However, the roles of Nrf2 and autophagy in bone metabolism under oxidative stress are controversial. Here, we explored the involvement of Nrf2 signaling and autophagy on the differentiation of ADSCs under conditions of oxidative stress. Exposure of ADSCs to H2O2 promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation concomitant with the reduction of cell viability, upregulation of Nrf2, the induction of apoptosis and autophagy, and the promotion of osteogenesis. Suppression of autophagic activity at particular stages resulted in the activation of the Nrf2 pathway, whereas osteoblastic differentiation of ADSCs was inhibited upon ROS stimulation. Silencing of Nrf2 promoted autophagy and osteoblastic differentiation upon ROS stimulation in vitro, and this effect was confirmed in vivo in a mouse model, in which bone formation was enhanced in mice receiving Nrf2-knockdown ADSCs. Taken together, these findings indicate that a negative interaction between the Nrf2 pathway and autophagy may modulate oxidative stress-induced ADSC osteogenesis, and suggest that Nrf2 is a potential target to regulate the differentiation of ADSCs into a specific lineage.

Abstract: Although periodontal diseases are initiated by bacteria that colonize the tooth surface and gingival sulcus, the host response is believed to play an essential role in the breakdown of connective tissue and bone. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) have been proposed to regulate the activation of the inflammatory response by the innate immune system. However, the role of mtROS in modulating the response of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) to immune stimulation by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) has yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we showed that LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis stimulated HGFs to increase mtROS production, which could be inhibited by treatment with a mitochondrial-targeted exogenous antioxidant (mito-TEMPO) or transfection with manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). A time-course study revealed that an increase in the concentration of mtROS preceded the expression of inflammatory cytokines in HGFs. Mito-TEMPO treatment or MnSOD transfection also significantly prevented the LPS-induced increase of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Furthermore, suppressing LPS-induced mtROS generation inhibited the activation of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase, as well as the nuclear localization of nuclear factor-κB. These results demonstrate that mtROS generation is a key signaling event in the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory response of HGFs.

Abstract: Summary
Vα24 invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subset of T lymphocytes implicated in the regulation of broad immune responses. They recognize lipid antigens presented by CD1d on antigen-presenting cells and induce both innate and adaptive immune responses, which enhance effective immunity against cancer. Conversely, reduced iNKT cell numbers and function have been observed in many patients with cancer. To recover these numbers, we reprogrammed human iNKT cells to pluripotency and then re-differentiated them into regenerated iNKT cells in vitro through an IL-7/IL-15-based optimized cytokine combination. The re-differentiated iNKT cells showed proliferation and IFN-γ production in response to α-galactosylceramide, induced dendritic cell maturation and downstream activation of both cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells, and exhibited NKG2D- and DNAM-1-mediated NK cell-like cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines. The immunological features of re-differentiated iNKT cells and their unlimited availability from induced pluripotent stem cells offer a potentially effective immunotherapy against cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Eicosanoid lipids play important roles in cellular signaling as second messengers in inflammation, immune response, vascular tone, and the CNS. Biosynthesis of eicosanoid lipids proceeds via hydrolysis of esterified arachidonic acid from phospholipids followed by oxidation of the released arachidonic acid by a variety of enzymes including cyclooxygenases (COX). Herein, we demonstrate the remarkable ability of COX-2, but not COX-1, to directly oxidize 2-arachidonoyl-lysolipids, resulting in the generation of previously unknown classes of eicosanoid-lysolipids, and provide evidence that intracellular lipases can release eicosanoids from their eicosanoid-lysolipid precursors. Importantly, genetic ablation of a phospholipase, iPLA2γ, significantly reduced the amounts of these eicosanoid-lysolipids in murine hepatic tissue and fibroblasts. Furthermore, calcium stimulation of wild-type murine lung fibroblasts produced robust increases in these eicosanoid-lysolipids, which were markedly attenuated in iPLA2γ−/− fibroblasts. Collectively, these results identify an iPLA2γ-initiated pathway generating new classes of lipid metabolites with potential signaling functions resulting from the direct COX-2 catalyzed oxidation of 2-arachidonoyl-lysolipids.

Abstract: Summary
Information transmission in biological signaling networks is commonly considered to be a unidirectional flow of information between protein partners. According to this view, many bacterial response regulator proteins utilize input receiver (REC) domains to “switch” functional outputs, using REC phosphorylation to shift pre-existing equilibria between inactive and active conformations. However, recent data indicate that output domains themselves also shift such equilibria, implying a “mutual inhibition” model. Here we use solution nuclear magnetic resonance to provide a mechanistic basis for such control in a PhyR-type response regulator. Our structure of the isolated, non-phosphorylated REC domain surprisingly reveals a fully active conformation, letting us identify structural and dynamic changes imparted by the output domain to inactivate the full-length protein. Additional data reveal transient structural changes within the full-length protein, facilitating activation. Our data provide a basis for understanding the changes that REC and output domains undergo to set a default “inactive” state.

Abstract: Dystrophin-deficient muscle is known to be more vulnerable to oxidative stress, but not much is known about the signaling pathway(s) responsible for this phenomenon. α-Syntrophin, a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, can function as a scaffold protein because of its multiple protein interaction domains. In this study, we investigated the role of α-syntrophin in C2 myoblasts under menadione-induced oxidative stress. We found that the protein level of α-syntrophin was elevated when cells were exposed to menadione. To investigate the function of α-syntrophin during oxidative stress, we established α-syntrophin-overexpressing and knockdown cell lines. The α-syntrophin-overexpressing cells were resistant to the menadione-induced oxidative stress. In addition, survival signalings such as protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation and the Bcl-2/BAX ratio were increased in these cells. On the other hand, apoptotic signals such as cleavage of caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) were increased in the α-syntrophin knockdown cells. Furthermore, Ca2+influx, which is known to increase when cells are exposed to oxidative stress, decreased in the α-syntrophin-overexpressing cells, but increased in the knockdown cells. These results suggest that α-syntrophin plays a pivotal role in the survival pathway triggered by menadione-induced oxidative stress in cultured myoblasts.

Abstract: The neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. In this study, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines were established from two SCA3 patients. Dermal fibroblasts were reprogrammed using an integration-free method and the resulting SCA3 iPSCs were differentiated into neurons. These neuronal lines harbored the disease causing mutation, expressed comparable levels of several neuronal markers and responded to the neurotransmitters, glutamate/glycine, GABA and acetylcholine. Additionally, all neuronal cultures formed networks displaying synchronized spontaneous calcium oscillations within 28days of maturation, and expressed the mature neuronal markers NeuN and Synapsin 1 implying a relatively advanced state of maturity, although not comparable to that of the adult human brain. Interestingly, we were not able to recapitulate the glutamate-induced ataxin-3 aggregation shown in a previously published iPSC-derived SCA3 model. In conclusion, we have generated a panel of SCA3 patient iPSCs and a robust protocol to derive neurons of relatively advanced maturity, which could potentially be valuable for the study of SCA3 disease mechanisms.

Abstract: The development of new strategies to preserve renal function after acute kidney injury (AKI) is necessary due to limited clinical intervention options. The organ-protective effects of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) and their conditioned medium (CM) have been investigated demonstrating that both separately promoted tubular recovery and ameliorated the outcome of AKI. Nevertheless, strategies to optimise the regenerative potential of both are highly needed. Here we investigated the effects of CM from adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) preincubated in a hypoxic environment (Hyp). Protective factors were investigated by PCR analysis and a protein array in vitro. The expression of 64 of the 308 proteins assayed was found to be more than two-fold increased after Hyp. CM of Hyp-pretreated ASCs (pCM) was used to enhance regeneration in a mouse model of cisplatin-induced AKI (cisAKI). Renal function was assessed by measurements of markers for AKI and serum cytokine levels. The pCM significantly ameliorated serum creatinine and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin values, and also the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 in the serum of mice with AKI. Our work clearly showed that a Hyp preconditioning significantly increases the release of protective factors in ASCs and enhances the therapeutic effects of CM in cisAKI in mice.

Abstract: Summary
Loss-of-function studies in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) require efficient methodologies for lesion of genes of interest. Here, we introduce a donor-free paired gRNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 knockout strategy (paired-KO) for efficient and rapid gene ablation in hPSCs. Through paired-KO, we succeeded in targeting all genes of interest with high biallelic targeting efficiencies. More importantly, during paired-KO, the cleaved DNA was repaired mostly through direct end joining without insertions/deletions (precise ligation), and thus makes the lesion product predictable. The paired-KO remained highly efficient for one-step targeting of multiple genes and was also efficient for targeting of microRNA, while for long non-coding RNA over 8 kb, cleavage of a short fragment of the core promoter region was sufficient to eradicate downstream gene transcription. This work suggests that the paired-KO strategy is a simple and robust system for loss-of-function studies for both coding and non-coding genes in hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
HIV cure efforts are hampered by limited characterization of the cells supporting HIV replication in vivo and inadequate methods for quantifying the latent viral reservoir in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. We combine fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization with detection of HIV protein and flow cytometry, enabling detection of 0.5–1 gag-pol mRNA+/Gag protein+-infected cells per million. In the peripheral blood of untreated persons, active HIV replication correlated with viremia and occurred in CD4 T cells expressing T follicular helper cell markers and inhibitory co-receptors. In virally suppressed subjects, the approach identified latently infected cells capable of producing HIV mRNA and protein after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin and latency-reversing agents (LRAs). While ingenol-induced reactivation mirrored the effector and central/transitional memory CD4 T cell contribution to the pool of integrated HIV DNA, bryostatin-induced reactivation occurred predominantly in cells expressing effector memory markers. This indicates that CD4 T cell differentiation status differentially affects LRA effectiveness.

Abstract: Summary
Conventional rabbit embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of pre-implantation embryos using methods and culture conditions that are established for primate ESCs. In this study, we explored the capacity of the rabbit ICM to give rise to ESC lines using conditions similar to those utilized to generate naive ESCs in mice. On single-cell dissociation and culture in fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)-free, serum-supplemented medium, rabbit ICMs gave rise to ESC lines lacking the DNA-damage checkpoint in the G1 phase like mouse ESCs, and with a pluripotency gene expression profile closer to the rabbit ICM/epiblast profiles. These cell lines can be converted to FGF2-dependent ESCs after culture in conventional conditions. They can also colonize the rabbit pre-implantation embryo. These results indicate that rabbit epiblast cells can be coaxed toward different types of pluripotent stem cells and reveal the dynamics of pluripotent states in rabbit ESCs.

Abstract: The yeast strains of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex involved in beer production are a heterogeneous group whose genetic and genomic features are not adequately determined. Thus, the aim of the present study was to provide a genetic characterization of selected group of commercially available brewing yeasts both ale top-fermenting and lager bottom-fermenting strains. Molecular karyotyping revealed that the diversity of chromosome patterns and four strains with the most accented genetic variabilities were selected and subjected to genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) analysis. The differences in the gene copy number were found in five functional gene categories: (1) maltose metabolism and transport, (2) response to toxin, (3) siderophore transport, (4) cellular aldehyde metabolic process, and (5) L-iditol 2-dehydrogenase activity (p < 0.05). In the Saflager W-34/70 strain (Fermentis) with the most affected array-CGH profile, loss of aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase (AAD) gene dosage correlated with an imbalanced redox state, oxidative DNA damage and breaks, lower levels of nucleolar proteins Nop1 and Fob1, and diminished tolerance to fermentation-associated stress stimuli compared to other strains. We suggest that compromised stress response may not only promote oxidant-based changes in the nucleolus state that may affect fermentation performance but also provide novel directions for future strain improvement.

Abstract: The understanding of metabolism during cell proliferation and commitment provides a greater insight into the basic biology of cells, allowing future applications. Here we evaluated the energy and oxidative changes during the early adipogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (hASCs). hASCs were maintained under differentiation conditions during 3 and 7days. Oxygen consumption, mitochondrial mass and membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities, non-protein thiols (NPT) concentration and lipid peroxidation were analyzed. We observed that 7days of adipogenic induction are required to stimulate cells to consume more oxygen and increase mitochondrial activity, indicating organelle maturation and a transition from glycolytic to oxidative energy metabolism. ROS production was only increased after 3days and may be involved in the differentiation commitment. ROS source was not only the mitochondria and we suggest that NOX proteins are related to ROS generation and therefore adipogenic commitment. ROS production did not change after 7days, but an increased activity of catalase and NPT concentration as well as a decreased lipid peroxidation were observed. Thus, a short period of differentiation induction is able to change the energetic and oxidative metabolic profile of hASCs and stimulate cytoprotection processes.

Abstract: Chemotherapy acts on cancer cells by producing multiple effects on a cell population including cell cycle arrest, necrosis, apoptosis and senescence. However, often a subpopulation of cells survives and the behavior of this subpopulation, which is responsible for cancer recurrence, remains obscure. Here we investigated the in vitro short- and long-term responses of six glioblastoma cell lines to clinically relevant doses of temozolomide for 5 days followed by 23 days of recovery, mimicking the standard schedule used in glioblastoma patient for this drug. These cells presented different profiles of sensitivity to temozolomide with varying levels of cell cycle arrest, autophagy and senescence, followed by a regrowth of the surviving cells. The initial reduction in cell number and the subsequent regrowth was analyzed with four new parameters applied to Cumulative Population Doubling (CPD) curves that describe the overall sensitivity of the population and the characteristic of the regrowth: the relative end point CPD (RendCPD); the relative Area Under Curve (rAUC); the Relative Time to Cross a Threshold (RTCT); and the Relative Proliferation Rate (RPR). Surprisingly, the kinetics of regrowth were not predicted by the mechanisms activated after treatment nor by the acute or overall sensitivity. With this study we added new parameters that describe key responses of glioblastoma cell populations to temozolomide treatment. These parameters can also be applied to other cell types and treatments and will help to understand the behavior of the surviving cancer cells after treatment and shed light on studies of cancer resistance and recurrence.

Abstract: Podocyte injury induced by sublytic complement attack is the main feature of membranous nephropathy (MN). This study aimed at investigating the impact of sublytic complement attack-related autophagy on podocyte injury in vitro. Here, we show that sublytic complement attack enhances MPC5 podocyte autophagy in vitro. Inhibition of autophagy by treatment with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) significantly increased sublytic complement attack-induced changes in the injury-related morphology, stress fiber, and podocyte apoptosis, but decreased the survival and adhesion of MPC5 podocytes. In contrast, promotion of autophagy by treatment with rapamycin mitigated sublytic complement attack-induced changes in the injury-related morphology, stress fiber, and podocyte apoptosis, but increased the survival and adhesion of MPC5 podocytes. These data suggest that autophagy may protect podocytes from sublytic complement attack-induced injury in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
A major hurdle for in vitro culturing of primary endothelial cells (ECs) is that they readily dedifferentiate, hampering their use for therapeutic applications. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) may provide an unlimited cell source; however, most current protocols deriving endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from hESCs use direct differentiation approaches albeit on undefined matrices, yet final yields are insufficient. We developed a method to culture monolayer hESCs on stem cell niche laminin (LN) LN511 or LN521 matrix. Here, we report a chemically defined, xeno-free protocol for differentiation of hESCs to EPCs using LN521 as the main culture substrate. We were able to generate ∼95% functional EPCs defined as VEGFR2+CD34+CD31+VE-Cadherin+. RNA-sequencing analyses of hESCs, EPCs, and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed differentiation-related EC expression signatures, regarding basement membrane composition, cell-matrix interactions, and changes in endothelial lineage markers. Our results may facilitate production of stable ECs for the treatment of vascular diseases and in vitro cell modeling.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle contains two distinct stem/progenitor populations. One is the satellite cell, which acts as a muscle stem cell, and the other is the mesenchymal progenitor, which contributes to muscle pathogeneses such as fat infiltration and fibrosis. Detailed and accurate characterization of these progenitors in humans remains elusive. Here, we performed comprehensive cell-surface protein profiling of the two progenitor populations residing in human skeletal muscle and identified three previously unrecognized markers: CD82 and CD318 for satellite cells and CD201 for mesenchymal progenitors. These markers distinguish myogenic and mesenchymal progenitors, and enable efficient isolation of the two types of progenitors. Functional study revealed that CD82 ensures expansion and preservation of myogenic progenitors by suppressing excessive differentiation, and CD201 signaling favors adipogenesis of mesenchymal progenitors. Thus, cell-surface proteins identified here are not only useful markers but also functionally important molecules, and provide valuable insight into human muscle biology and diseases.

Abstract: Hyperhomocysteinemia induces the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) inhibits the phenotype switch of VSMCs and calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) regulated the production of endogenous H2S. However, whether CaSR inhibits the proliferation of VSMCs by regulating the endogenous cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE, a major enzyme that produces H2S) pathway in high homocysteine (HHcy) has not been previously investigated. The intracellular calcium concentration, the concentration of H2S, the cell viability, the proliferation and the expression of proteins of cultured VSMCs from rat thoracic aortas were measured, respectively. The results showed that the [Ca2+]i and the expression of p-CaMK and CSE increased upon treatment with CaSR agonist. In HHcy, the H2S concentration decrease, the proliferation and migration rate increased, the expression of Cyclin D1, PCNA, Osteopontin and p-Erk1/2 increased while the α-SM actin, P21Cip/WAK−1 and Calponin decreased. The CaSR agonist or exogenous H2S significantly reversed the changes of VSMCs caused by HHcy. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that CaSR regulate the endogenous CSE/H2S is related to the PLC-IP3 receptor and CaM signal pathways which inhibit the proliferation of VSMCs, and the latter is involved in the Erk1/2 dependent signal pathway in high homocysteine.

Abstract: Summary
Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by fatal motoric failures induced by loss of striatal medium spiny neurons. Neuronal cell death has been linked to impaired expression and axonal transport of the neurotrophin BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor). By transplanting embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors overexpressing BDNF, we combined cell replacement and BDNF supply as a potential HD therapy approach. Transplantation of purified neural progenitors was analyzed in a quinolinic acid (QA) chemical and two genetic HD mouse models (R6/2 and N171-82Q) on the basis of distinct behavioral parameters, including CatWalk gait analysis. Explicit rescue of motor function by BDNF neural progenitors was found in QA-lesioned mice, whereas genetic mouse models displayed only minor improvements. Tumor formation was absent, and regeneration was attributed to enhanced neuronal and striatal differentiation. In addition, adult neurogenesis was preserved in a BDNF-dependent manner. Our findings provide significant insight for establishing therapeutic strategies for HD to ameliorate neurodegenerative symptoms.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with an HNF1BS148L/+ mutation (MODY5) typically exhibit pancreatic hypoplasia. However, the molecular mechanisms are unknown due to inaccessibility of patient material and because mouse models do not fully recapitulate MODY5. Here, we differentiated MODY5 human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into pancreatic progenitors, and show that the HNF1BS148L/+ mutation causes a compensatory increase in several pancreatic transcription factors, and surprisingly, a decrease in PAX6 pancreatic gene expression. The lack of suppression of PDX1, PTF1A, GATA4, and GATA6 indicates that MODY5-mediated pancreatic hypoplasia is mechanistically independent. Overexpression studies demonstrate that a compensatory increase in PDX1 gene expression is due to mutant HNF1BS148L/+ but not wild-type HNF1B or HNF1A. Furthermore, HNF1B does not appear to directly regulate PAX6 gene expression necessary for glucose tolerance. Our results demonstrate compensatory mechanisms in the pancreatic transcription factor network due to mutant HNF1BS148L/+ protein. Thus, patients typically develop MODY5 but not neonatal diabetes despite exhibiting pancreatic hypoplasia.

Abstract: Summary
For cell transplantation therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) to be realized, the grafted neurons should be integrated into the host neuronal circuit to restore the lost neuronal function. Here, using wheat-germ agglutinin-based transsynaptic tracing, we show that integrin α5 is selectively expressed in striatal neurons that are innervated by midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. In addition, we found that integrin α5β1 was activated by the administration of estradiol-2-benzoate (E2B) in striatal neurons of adult female rats. Importantly, we observed that the systemic administration of E2B into hemi-parkinsonian rat models facilitates the functional integration of grafted DA neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells into the host striatal neuronal circuit via the activation of integrin α5β1. Finally, methamphetamine-induced abnormal rotation was recovered earlier in E2B-administered rats than in rats that received other regimens. Our results suggest that the simultaneous administration of E2B with stem cell-derived DA progenitors can enhance the efficacy of cell transplantation therapy for PD.

Abstract: Purpose
This study aims to examine the expression profiles miR-1288 in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The cellular implications and target interactions of ESCC cells following miR-1288 overexpression was also examined.
Methods
In total, 120 oesophageal tissues (90 primary ESCCs and 30 non-neoplastic tissues) were recruited for miR-1288 expression analysis using qRT-PCR. An exogenous miR-1288 mimic and its inhibitor were used to explore the in-vitro effects of miR-1288 on ESCC cells by performing cell proliferation, colony formation, cell invasion and migration assays. Localisation and modulatory changes of various miR-1288 regulated proteins such as FOXO1, p53, TAB3, BCL2 and kRAS was examined using immunofluorescence and western blot.
Results
Overexpression of miR-1288 was more often noted in ESCC tissues when compared to non-neoplastic oesophageal tissues. High expression was often noted in high grade carcinomas and with metastases. Patients with high levels of miR-1288 expression showed a slightly better survival compared to patients with low miR-1288 levels. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-1288 showed increased cell proliferation and colony formation, improved cell migration and enhanced cell invasion properties in ESCC cells. In addition, miR-1288 overexpression in ESCC cells showed repression of cytoplasmic tumour suppressor FOXO1 protein expression. Inversely, inhibition of miR-1288 expression exhibited remarkable upregulation of FOXO1 protein, while expressions of other tested proteins remain unchanged.
Conclusions
Up regulation of miR-1288 expression in ESCC tissues and miR-1288 induced oncogenic features of ESCC cells in-vitro indicates the oncogenic roles of miR-1288 in ESCCs. Overexpression of miR-1288 play a key role in the pathogenesis of ESCCs and its modulation may have potential therapeutic value in patients with ESCC.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogenesis originates from self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Previous studies have reported conflicting roles of gonadotropic pituitary hormones in SSC self-renewal. Here, we explored the role of hormonal regulation of SSCs using Fshb and Lhcgr knockout (KO) mice. Although follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is thought to promote self-renewal by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), no abnormalities were found in SSCs and their microenvironment. In contrast, SSCs were enriched in Lhcgr-deficient mice. Moreover, wild-type SSCs transplanted into Lhcgr-deficient mice showed enhanced self-renewal. Microarray analysis revealed that Lhcgr-deficient testes have enhanced WNT5A expression in Sertoli cells, which showed an immature phenotype. Since WNT5A was upregulated by anti-androgen treatment, testosterone produced by luteinizing hormone (LH) is required for Sertoli cell maturation. WNT5A promoted SSC activity both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, FSH is not responsible for GDNF regulation, while LH negatively regulates SSC self-renewal by suppressing WNT5A via testosterone.

Abstract: Multiple cytokines and growth factors expressed at the fetal-maternal interface are involved in the regulation of trophoblast functions and placental growth, but the role of G-CSF has not been completely established. Based on our previous study showing that G-CSF increases the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and the release of vascular endothelial growth factor in Swan 71 human trophoblast cells, in this work we explore the possible contribution of G-CSF to cell migration and the G-CSF-triggered signaling pathway. We found that G-CSF induced morphological changes on actin cytoskeleton consistent with a migratory cell phenotype. G-CSF also up-regulated the expression levels of β1 integrin and promoted Swan 71 cell migration. By using selective pharmacological inhibitors and dominant negative mutants we showed that PI3K, Erk 1/2 and p38 pathways are required for promoting Swan 71 cell motility. It was also demonstrated that PI3K behaved as an upstream regulator of Erk 1/2 and p38 MAPK. In addition, the increase of β1 integrin expression was dependent on PI3K activation. In conclusion, our results indicate that G-CSF stimulates β1 integrin expression and Swan 71 cell migration by activating PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, suggesting that G-CSF should be considered as an additional regulatory factor that contributes to a successful embryo implantation and to the placenta development.

Abstract: Summary
The transition from hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) to hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HS/PCs), or endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT), is a critical step during hematopoiesis. However, little is known about the molecular determinants of HECs due to the challenge in defining HECs. We report here the generation of GATA2w/eGFP reporter in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to mark cells expressing GATA2, a critical gene for EHT. We show that during differentiation, functional HECs are almost exclusively GATA2/eGFP+. We then constructed a regulatory network for HEC determination and also identified a panel of positive or negative surface markers for discriminating HECs from non-hemogenic ECs. Among them, ITGB3 (CD61) precisely labeled HECs both in hESC differentiation and embryonic day 10 mouse embryos. These results not only identify a reliable marker for defining HECs, but also establish a robust platform for dissecting hematopoiesis in vitro, which might lead to the generation of HSCs in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Zwitterionic capsular polysaccharides (ZPSs) are bacterial products that modulate T cells, including inducing anti-inflammatory IL-10-secreting T regulatory cells (Tregs). However, only a few diverse bacteria are known to modulate the host immune system via ZPS. We present a genomic screen for bacteria encoding ZPS molecules. We identify diverse host-associated bacteria, including commensals and pathogens with known anti-inflammatory properties, with the capacity to produce ZPSs. Human mononuclear cells stimulated with lysates from putative ZPS-producing bacteria induce significantly greater IL-10 production and higher proportions of Tregs than lysates from non-ZPS-encoding relatives or a commensal strain of Bacteroides cellulosilyticus in which a putative ZPS biosynthetic operon was genetically disrupted. Similarly, wild-type B. cellulosilyticus DSM 14838, but not a close relative lacking a putative ZPS, attenuated experimental colitis in mice. Collectively, this screen identifies bacterial strains that may use ZPSs to interact with the host as well as those with potential probiotic properties.

Abstract: Gene family encoding cellular nucleic acid binding proteins (CNBP) is well conserved among vertebrates; however, there is limited knowledge in lower organisms. In this study, a CNBP homolog from the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii was characterised. The full-length cDNA of PcCNBP was of 1257 bp with a 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of 63 bp and a 3′-UTR of 331 bp with a poly (A) tail, and an open-reading frame (ORF) of 864 bp encoding a polypeptide of 287 amino acids with the predicted molecular weight of about 33 kDa. The predicted protein possesses 7 tandem repeats of 14 amino acids containing the CCHC zinc finger consensus sequence, two RGG-rich single-stranded RNA-binding domain and a nuclear localization signal, strongly suggesting that PcCNBP was a homolog of vertebrate CNBP. The PcCNBP transcript was constitutively expressed in all tested tissues of unchallenged crayfish, including hepatopancreas, gill, eyestalk, haemocytes, intestine, stomach and cuticle with highest expression in haemocytes, intestine, gills and hepatopancreas. The mRNA expression of PcCNBP in haemocytes was modulated at transcriptional level by different immune challenges, suggesting its involvement in the immune response of P. clarkii during both bacteria and viruses infection.

Abstract: Summary
Protein kinases are attractive therapeutic targets because their dysregulation underlies many diseases, including cancer. The high conservation of the kinase domain and the evolution of drug resistance, however, pose major challenges to the development of specific kinase inhibitors. We recently discovered selective Src kinase inhibitors from a DNA-templated macrocycle library. Here, we reveal the structural basis for how these inhibitors retain activity against a disease-relevant, drug-resistant kinase mutant, while maintaining Src specificity. We find that these macrocycles display a degree of modularity: two of their three variable groups interact with sites on the kinase that confer selectivity, while the third group interacts with the universally conserved catalytic lysine and thereby retains the ability to inhibit the “gatekeeper” kinase mutant. We also show that these macrocycles inhibit migration of MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells. Our findings establish intracellular kinase inhibition by peptidic macrocycles, and inform the development of potent and specific kinase inhibitors.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that Sox2-expressing stem/progenitor cells play roles in the pituitary cell turnover. Two types of niches have been proposed for stem/progenitor cells, the marginal cell layer (MCL) and the dense cell clusters in the parenchyma. Among them, the appearance of the parenchymal-niche only after birth indicates that this niche is involved in the cell turnover required for the postnatal pituitary. However, little is known about the roles of the parenchymal-niche and its regulation. The present study aimed to isolate pituitary stem/progenitor cells from the parenchymal-niche in the adult rat pituitary. Cell dispersion by stepwise treatment with proteases allowed the isolation of dense cell clusters. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that clusters are universally composed of SOX2-positive cells, and most of them are positive for PROP1. Taken together with the anatomical analysis, we concluded that the isolated clusters are the parenchymal stem/progenitor cell (PS)-clusters, not the MCL-one. PS-clusters cultivated by serum-free overlay 3-dimensional culture maintained their stemness, and treatment with bFGF and EGF induced cyst-formation. Moreover, PS-clusters demonstrated some differentiation capacity with GSK3β-inhibitor treatment. Collectively, the present study demonstrates a simple method for isolating stem/progenitor cells from the parenchymal-niche, and provides tools to analyze the factors for regulating the pituitary niches.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium (Ca2+) flux into the matrix is tightly controlled by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) due to vital roles in cell death and bioenergetics. However, the precise atomic mechanisms of MCU regulation remain unclear. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal matrix domain of human MCU, revealing a β-grasp-like fold with a cluster of negatively charged residues that interacts with divalent cations. Binding of Ca2+ or Mg2+ destabilizes and shifts the self-association equilibrium of the domain toward monomer. Mutational disruption of the acidic face weakens oligomerization of the isolated matrix domain and full-length human protein similar to cation binding and markedly decreases MCU activity. Moreover, mitochondrial Mg2+ loading or blockade of mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion suppresses MCU Ca2+-uptake rates. Collectively, our data reveal that the β-grasp-like matrix region harbors an MCU-regulating acidic patch that inhibits human MCU activity in response to Mg2+ and Ca2+ binding.

Abstract: Summary
Direct conversion of somatic cells into neural stem cells (NSCs) by defined factors holds great promise for mechanistic studies, drug screening, and potential cell therapies for different neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report that a single zinc-finger transcription factor, Zfp521, is sufficient for direct conversion of human fibroblasts into long-term self-renewable and multipotent NSCs. In vitro, Zfp521-induced NSCs maintained their characteristics in the absence of exogenous factor expression and exhibited morphological, molecular, developmental, and functional properties that were similar to control NSCs. In addition, the single-seeded induced NSCs were able to form NSC colonies with efficiency comparable with control NSCs and expressed NSC markers. The converted cells were capable of surviving, migrating, and attaining neural phenotypes after transplantation into neonatal mouse and adult rat brains, without forming tumors. Moreover, the Zfp521-induced NSCs predominantly expressed rostral genes. Our results suggest a facilitated approach for establishing human NSCs through Zfp521-driven conversion of fibroblasts.

Abstract: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common type of primary glomerulonephritis, characterized by mesangial deposition of pathogenic IgA and the injury to mesangial cells. Our previous studies indicate that secretory IgA (SIgA) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IgAN, and miR-16 is involved in destructive process in mesangial cells mediated by the SIgA from IgAN patients. Our current study aimed to study the role of miRNAs in the effect of SIgA from IgAN patients on mesangial cells. MicroRNA microarray and cytokines assay were performed to obtain the differential microRNAs expression profile in human renal mesangial cells stimulated by SIgA from IgAN patients (P-SIgA) with the cells treated by SIgA from healthy subjects (N-SgA) as control. The microRNAs with the most significant differences in microarray analysis were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Among them, miR-100-3p and miR-877-3p were selected to predict target gene related to cytokines detecting in this study. Fifty-six differentially expressed microRNAs were chosen and 17 microRNAs with the most prominent changes were validated. Compared with N-SIgA, P-SIgA increased the production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and transforming growth factor-β1. In addition, we for the first time demonstrated that over-production of IL-8 induced by the SIgA was regulated by down-expression of miR-100-3p in mesangial cells. Similarly, IL-1β over-production was regulated by down-expression of miR-877-3p. Our findings represent a pathogenic microRNAs expression profiling in human mesangial cells activated by P-SIgA. Furthermore, we provide a new explanation characterizing the molecular mechanism responsible for the regulation of IL-1β and IL-8 production in P-SIgA-triggered mesangial cells.

Abstract: The airway epithelium acts as a frontline barrier against various environmental insults and its repair process after airway injury is critical for the lung homeostasis restoration. Recently, the role of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as transcription-independent damage signaling has been highlighted in the wound repair process. Both conditions of continuous hypoxia and intermittent hypoxia (IH) induce ROS. Although IH is important in clinical settings, the roles of IH-induced ROS in the airway repair process have not been investigated. In this study, we firstly showed that IH induced mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and significantly decreased bronchial epithelial cell migration, prevented by catalase treatment in a wound scratch assay. RhoA activity was higher during repair process in the IH condition compared to in the normoxic condition, resulting in the cellular morphological changes shown by immunofluorescence staining: round cells, reduced central stress fiber numbers, pronounced cortical actin filament distributions, and punctate focal adhesions. These phenotypes were replicated by exogenous H2O2 treatment under the normoxic condition. Our findings confirmed the transcription-independent role of IH-induced intracellular ROS in the bronchial epithelial cell repair process and might have significant implications for impaired bronchial epithelial cell regeneration.

Abstract: Modification of the bone marrow microenvironment is considered as a promising strategy to control leukemic cell proliferation, diseases progression and relapse after treatment. However, due to the diversity and complexity of the cellular and molecular compartments in the leukemic microenvironment, it is extremely difficult to dissect the role of each individual molecule or cell type in vivo. Here we established an in vitro system to dissect the role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), stromal cells and endothelial cells in the growth of mouse myeloid tumor cells and B-lymphoma cells. We found that either LPS or bone marrow stromal cells as a feeder layer in culture is required for the proliferation of myeloid tumor cells. Surprisingly, the growth of myeloid leukemic cells on stromal cells is strongly inhibited when coupled with LPS in culture. This opposing effect of LPS, a complete switch from pro-proliferation to antitumor growth is due, at least in part, to the rapidly increased production of interleukin 12, Fas ligand and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 from stromal cells stimulated by LPS. These results demonstrate that LPS can either facilitate or attenuate tumor cell proliferation, thus changing the disease course of myeloid leukemias through its direct effect or modulation of the tumor microenvironment.

14-3-3ζ promotes lung cancer cell invasion by increasing the Snail protein expression through atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)/NF-κB signaling,

Abstract: 14–3-3ζ has been identified as a putative oncogene in several cancers, including non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the mechanisms underlying its functions remain undefined. In this study, we show that overexpression of 14–3-3ζ was frequently detected in lung adenocarcinoma (LuAC) tissues and was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and poor outcome. Functional studies demonstrated that 14–3-3ζ promoted migration and invasion in A549 cells, both of which were effectively inhibited when 14–3-3ζ was silenced with short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Furthermore, 14–3-3ζ-mediated invasion of cancer cells was found to upregulate Snail through the activation of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC).

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) originate from hemogenic endothelium within the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of the mammalian embryo. The relationship between genetic circuits controlling stem cell genesis and multi-potency is not understood. A Gata2 cis element (+9.5) enhances Gata2 expression in the AGM and induces the endothelial to HSC transition. We demonstrated that GATA-2 rescued hematopoiesis in +9.5−/− AGMs. As G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most common targets for FDA-approved drugs, we analyzed the GPCR gene ensemble to identify GATA-2-regulated GPCRs. Of the 20 GATA-2-activated GPCR genes, four were GATA-1-activated, and only Gpr65 expression resembled Gata2. Contrasting with the paradigm in which GATA-2-activated genes promote hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell genesis/function, our mouse and zebrafish studies indicated that GPR65 suppressed hematopoiesis. GPR65 established repressive chromatin at the +9.5 site, restricted occupancy by the activator Scl/TAL1, and repressed Gata2 transcription. Thus, a Gata2 cis element creates a GATA-2-GPCR circuit that limits positive regulators that promote hematopoiesis.

Abstract: Summary
Tension production and contractile properties are poorly characterized aspects of excitation-contraction coupling of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Previous approaches have been limited due to the small size and structural immaturity of early-stage hiPSC-CMs. We developed a substrate nanopatterning approach to produce hiPSC-CMs in culture with adult-like dimensions, T-tubule-like structures, and aligned myofibrils. We then isolated myofibrils from hiPSC-CMs and measured the tension and kinetics of activation and relaxation using a custom-built apparatus with fast solution switching. The contractile properties and ultrastructure of myofibrils more closely resembled human fetal myofibrils of similar gestational age than adult preparations. We also demonstrated the ability to study the development of contractile dysfunction of myofibrils from a patient-derived hiPSC-CM cell line carrying the familial cardiomyopathy MYH7 mutation (E848G). These methods can bring new insights to understanding cardiomyocyte maturation and developmental mechanical dysfunction of hiPSC-CMs with cardiomyopathic mutations.

Abstract: Summary
RIG-I detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to trigger antiviral cytokine production. Protein deamidation is emerging as a post-translational modification that chiefly regulates protein function. We report here that UL37 of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a protein deamidase that targets RIG-I to block RNA-induced activation. Mass spectrometry analysis identified two asparagine residues in the helicase 2i domain of RIG-I that were deamidated upon UL37 expression or HSV-1 infection. Deamidation rendered RIG-I unable to sense viral dsRNA, thus blocking its ability to trigger antiviral immune responses and restrict viral replication. Purified full-length UL37 and its carboxyl-terminal fragment were sufficient to deamidate RIG-I in vitro. Uncoupling RIG-I deamidation from HSV-1 infection, by engineering deamidation-resistant RIG-I or introducing deamidase-deficient UL37 into the HSV-1 genome, restored RIG-I activation and antiviral immune signaling. Our work identifies a viral deamidase and extends the paradigm of deamidation-mediated suppression of innate immunity by microbial pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Protein arginine phosphorylation is a recently discovered modification that affects multiple cellular pathways in Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, the phosphorylation of arginine residues by McsB is critical for regulating the cellular stress response. Given that the highly efficient protein arginine phosphatase YwlE prevents arginine phosphorylation under non-stress conditions, we hypothesized that this enzyme negatively regulates arginine phosphorylation and acts as a sensor of cell stress. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed the first suite of highly potent and specific SO3-amidine-based YwlE inhibitors. With these protein arginine phosphatase-specific probes, we demonstrated that YwlE activity is suppressed by oxidative stress, which consequently increases arginine phosphorylation, thereby inducing the expression of stress-response genes, which is critical for bacterial virulence. Overall, we predict that these novel chemical tools will be widely used to study the regulation of protein arginine phosphorylation in multiple organisms.

Abstract: Summary
Polyoxin, produced by Streptomcyes cacaoi var. asoensis and Streptomyces aureochromogenes, contains two non-proteinogenic amino acids, carbamoylpolyoxamic acid (CPOAA) and polyoximic acid. Although the CPOAA moiety is highly unusual, its biosynthetic logic has remained enigmatic for decades. Here, we address CPOAA biosynthesis by reconstitution of its pathway. We demonstrated that its biosynthesis is initiated by a versatile N-acetyltransferase, PolN, catalyzing L-glutamate (1) to N-acetyl glutamate (2). Remarkably, we verified that PolM, a previously annotated dehydrogenase, catalyzes an unprecedented tandem reduction of acyl-phosphate to aldehyde, and subsequently to alcohol. We also unveiled a distinctive acetylation cycle catalyzed by PolN to synthesize α-amino-δ-hydroxyvaleric acid (6). Finally, we report that PolL is capable of converting a rare sequential hydroxylation of α-amino-δ-carbamoylhydroxyvaleric acid (7) to CPOAA. PolL represents an intriguing family of Fe(II)-dependent α-ketoglutarate dioxygenase with a cupin fold. These data illustrate several novel enzymatic reactions, and also set a foundation for rational pathway engineering for polyoxin production.

Abstract: Summary
Host-microbial symbioses are vital to health; nonetheless, little is known about the role crosskingdom signaling plays in these relationships. In a process called quorum sensing, bacteria communicate with one another using extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. One autoinducer, AI-2, is proposed to promote interspecies bacterial communication, including in the mammalian gut. We show that mammalian epithelia produce an AI-2 mimic activity in response to bacteria or tight-junction disruption. This AI-2 mimic is detected by the bacterial AI-2 receptor, LuxP/LsrB, and can activate quorum-sensing-controlled gene expression, including in the enteric pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. AI-2 mimic activity is induced when epithelia are directly or indirectly exposed to bacteria, suggesting that a secreted bacterial component(s) stimulates its production. Mutagenesis revealed genes required for bacteria to both detect and stimulate production of the AI-2 mimic. These findings uncover a potential role for the mammalian AI-2 mimic in fostering crosskingdom signaling and host-bacterial symbioses.

Abstract: β-catenin is a key mediator of Wnt signaling and its deregulated nuclear accumulation can drive cancer progression. While the central armadillo (Arm) repeats of β-catenin stimulate nuclear entry, the N- and C-terminal “tail” sequences are thought to regulate turnover and transactivation. We show here that the N- and C-tails are also potent transport sequences. The unstructured tails of β-catenin, when individually fused to a GFP-reporter, could enter and exit the nucleus rapidly in live cells. Proximity ligation assays and pull-down assays identified a weak interaction between the tail sequences and the FG-repeats of nucleoporins, consistent with a possible direct translocation of β-catenin through the nuclear pore complex. Extensive alanine mutagenesis of the tail sequences revealed that nuclear translocation of β-catenin was dependent on specific uniformly distributed patches of hydrophobic residues, whereas the mutagenesis of acidic amino acids had no effect. Moreover, the mutation of hydrophobic patches within the N-tail and C-tail of full length β-catenin reduced nuclear transport rate and diminished its ability to activate transcription. We propose that the tail sequences can contribute to β-catenin transport and suggest a possible similar role for hydrophobic unstructured regions in other proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Xantholipin and several related polycyclic xanthone antibiotics feature a unique xanthone ring nucleus within a highly oxygenated, angular, fused hexacyclic system. In this study, we demonstrated that a flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO) XanO4 catalyzes the oxidative transformation of an anthraquinone to a xanthone system during the biosynthesis of xantholipin. In vitro isotopic labeling experiments showed that the reaction involves sequential insertion of two oxygen atoms, accompanied by an unexpected cryptic demethoxylation reaction. Moreover, characterizations of homologous FMOs of XanO4 suggested the generality of the XanO4-like-mediated reaction for the assembly of a xanthone ring in the biosynthesis of polycyclic xanthone antibiotics. These findings not only expand the repertoire of FMO activities but also reveal a novel mechanism for xanthone ring formation.

Histone Demethylase LSD1 Promotes Adipocyte Differentiation through Repressing Wnt Signaling,

Abstract: Summary
Adipose tissue plays important roles in animals. White fat stores energy in lipids, while brown fat is responsible for nonshivering thermogenesis through UCP1-mediated energy dissipation. Although epigenetic mechanisms modulate differentiation in multiple lineages, the epigenetic regulation of brown adipocyte differentiation is poorly understood. By screening a collection of epigenetic compounds, we found that Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitors repress brown adipocyte differentiation. RNAi-mediated Lsd1 knockdown causes a similar effect, which can be rescued by expression of wild-type but not catalytic-inactive LSD1. Mechanistically, LSD1 promotes brown adipogenesis by demethylating H3K4 on promoter regions of Wnt signaling components and repressing the Wnt pathway. Furthermore, deletion of Lsd1 in mice leads to inhibition of brown adipogenesis, validating the pivotal role of LSD1 in brown fat development in vivo. Our work identifies LSD1 as a key epigenetic regulator in brown adipogenesis. The link between LSD1 and the Wnt pathway provides potential opportunities to modulate brown fat differentiation.

Abstract: Clearance of the apoptotic cells by phagocytes plays pivotal roles in maintenance of tissue homeostasis, promotion of immunological tolerance and anti-inflammatory response. Recent studies show that autophagy is involved in phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells. However, contribution of autophagy to phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells by macrophages is not clearly defined. Here, we assessed cytoprotective effect of autophagy on clearance of the apoptotic cells. Apoptosis of murine splenic lymphocytes and human T-cell leukemia cells was induced with cyclophosphamide. After engulfment of the apoptotic cells, expression of Belin-1 and LC3 in macrophages was upregulated, the number of MDC-positive vesicles, LC3-positive autophagosomes and autophagic ultrastructures increased significantly. Autophagosome was fused with phagosome containing fragments of the nuclei or other debris of the apoptotic cells to form amphisome. Some cells in macrophages phagocytosing the apoptotic cells became apoptotic. After autophagy of macrophages was inhibited with 3-MA, viability and survival of macrophages reduced, phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells by macrophages deceased significantly. These results demonstrate that autophagy plays an important role in promoting clearance of the apoptotic cells by protecting macrophages from apoptosis during phagocytosis as well as degrading the contents of phagosomes via amphisome formation.

Abstract: We previously demonstrated that an αvβ5 integrin/FAK- mediated pathway regulated the phagocytic properties of human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells. Here we demonstrate that this process is mediated by Rac-1 and a previously unreported signaling pathway that utilizes the Tiam1 as well as a novel ILK/RhoG/ELMO2 signaling pathway. Phagocytosis in both a TM-1 cell line and normal HTM cells was mediated by Rac1 and could be significantly decreased by >75% using the Rac1 inhibitor EHop-016. Knockdown of Rac1 in TM-1 cells also inhibited phagocytosis by 40% whereas overexpression of a constitutively active Rac1 or stimulation with PDGF increased phagocytosis by 83% and 32% respectively. Tiam1 was involved in regulating phagocytosis. Knockdown of Tiam1 inhibited phagocytosis by 72% while overexpression of Tiam1 C1199 increased phagocytosis by 75%. Other upstream effectors of Rac1 found to be involved included ELMO2, RhoG, and ILK. Knockdowns of ELMO2, ILK, and RhoG caused a reduction in phagocytosis by 51%, 55% and 46% respectively. In contrast, knockdown of Vav2 and Dock1 or overexpression of Vav2 Y159/172F did not cause a significant change in phagocytosis. These data suggest a novel link between Tiam1 and RhoG/ILK /ELMO2 pathway as upstream effectors of the Rac1-mediated phagocytic process in TM cells.

Abstract: Summary
Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is the dominant cause of urinary tract infections, clinically described as cystitis. UPEC express CUP pili, which are extracellular fibers tipped with adhesins that bind mucosal surfaces of the urinary tract. Here we identify the role of the F9/Yde/Fml pilus for UPEC persistence in the inflamed urothelium. The Fml adhesin FmlH binds galactose β1-3 N-acetylgalactosamine found in core-1 and -2 O-glycans. Deletion of fmlH had no effect on UPEC virulence in an acute mouse model of cystitis. However, FmlH provided a fitness advantage during chronic cystitis, which is manifested as persistent bacteriuria, high bladder bacterial burdens, and chronic inflammation. In situ binding confirmed that FmlH bound avidly to the inflamed, but not the naive bladder. In accordance with its pathogenic profile, vaccination with FmlH significantly protected mice from chronic cystitis. Thus, UPEC employ separate CUP pili to adapt to the rapidly changing niche during bladder infection.

Abstract: Summary
Fusobacterium nucleatum is associated with colorectal cancer and promotes colonic tumor formation in preclinical models. However, fusobacteria are core members of the human oral microbiome and less prevalent in the healthy gut, raising questions about how fusobacteria localize to CRC. We identify a host polysaccharide and fusobacterial lectin that explicates fusobacteria abundance in CRC. Gal-GalNAc, which is overexpressed in CRC, is recognized by fusobacterial Fap2, which functions as a Gal-GalNAc lectin. F. nucleatum binding to clinical adenocarcinomas correlates with Gal-GalNAc expression and is reduced upon O-glycanase treatment. Clinical fusobacteria strains naturally lacking Fap2 or inactivated Fap2 mutants show reduced binding to Gal-GalNAc-expressing CRC cells and established CRCs in mice. Additionally, intravenously injected F. nucleatum localizes to mouse tumor tissues in a Fap2-dependent manner, suggesting that fusobacteria use a hematogenous route to reach colon adenocarcinomas. Thus, targeting F. nucleatum Fap2 or host epithelial Gal-GalNAc may reduce fusobacteria potentiation of CRC.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are physiologically maintained in vascular endothelial cell (VEC)-based niches, play a critical role in tissue regeneration. Our previous studies demonstrated that sympathetic denervation could promote MSC mobilization, thereby enhancing bone formation in distraction osteogenesis (DO), a self-tissue engineering for craniofacial and orthopeadic surgeries. However, the mechanisms on how sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) regulates MSC migration are not well understood. Here we showed that deprivation of NE by transection of cervical sympathetic trunk (TCST) inhibited stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) expression in the perivascular regions in rat mandibular DO. In vitro studies showed that NE treatment markedly upregulated p-JNK and therefore stimulated higher SDF-1 expression in VECs than control groups, and siRNA knockdown of the abrd3 gene abolished the NE-induced p-JNK activation. On the other hand, osteoblasts differentiated from MSCs showed an increase in SDF-1 secretion with lack of NE. Importantly, NE-treated VECs inhibited the MSC chemotaxis migration along the SDF-1 concentration gradient as demonstrated in a novel 3-chamber Transwell assay. Collectively, our study suggested that NE may increase the SDF-1 secretion by VECs via NE/abrd3/JNK pathway, thereby inhibiting the MSC chemotaxis migration from perivascular regions toward bone trabecular frontlines along the SDF-1 concentration gradient in bone regeneration.

Abstract: PHOX2B and its paralogue gene PHOX2A are two homeodomain proteins in the network regulating the development of autonomic ganglia that have been associated with the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (NB), because of their over-expression in different NB cell lines and tumour samples. We used the SK-N-BE(2)C cell line to show that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a drug that is widely used to inhibit growth and induce differentiation in NBs, regulates both PHOX2A and PHOX2B expression, albeit by means of different mechanisms: it up-regulates PHOX2A and down-regulates PHOX2B. Both mechanisms act at transcriptional level, but prolonged ATRA treatment selectively degrades the PHOX2A protein, whereas the corresponding mRNA remains up-regulated. Further, we show that PHOX2A is capable of modulating PHOX2B expression, but this mechanism is not involved in the PHOX2B down-regulation induced by retinoic acid. Our findings demonstrate that PHOX2A expression is finely controlled during retinoic acid differentiation and this, together with PHOX2B down-regulation, reinforces the idea that they may be useful biomarkers for NB staging, prognosis and treatment decision making.
