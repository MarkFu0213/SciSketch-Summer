Abstract: C2C12 murine myoblasts are a common model for studying muscle differentiation. Platelet endothelial aggregation receptor-1 (PEAR1), an epidermal growth factor repeat-containing transmembrane receptor, is known to participate in platelet contact-induced activation. In the present study, we demonstrated that PEAR1 is involved in the differentiation of C2C12 murine myoblasts. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to determine PEAR1 expression and localization during C2C12 cell differentiation. Subsequently, PEAR1 expression was activated and inhibited using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-dCas9 technology to explore its effects on this process. PEAR1 expression was found to increase over the course of C2C12 cell differentiation. This protein was predominately localized on the membrane of these cells, where it clustered upon induction of differentiation. Expression of the myogenic markers Desmin, MYOG, and MYH2 revealed that PEAR1 positively regulated C2C12 cell differentiation. Moreover, induction of muscle injury by administration of bupivacaine to mice indicated that PEAR1 might play a role in muscle regeneration. In summary, our study confirmed the involvement of PEAR1 in C2C12 cell differentiation, contributing to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle development.

Abstract: Successful hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation rests upon reliable methods for their enumeration in sources such as cord blood (CB). Methods used today are costly, time consuming and exhaust the limited number of cells needed for transplantation. The aim of this study was to analyze if surplus plasma from CB contains biomarkers that can predict HSPC content in CB. Frozen, surplus plasma from 95 CB units was divided into two groups based on CD34+ cell concentration. Birth weight, gestation age, gender, mode of delivery, collection volume, nucleated cell count and colony forming unit assay results were available. Samples were analyzed with a proximity ligation assay covering 92 different proteins. Two-group t-test with p-values adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) identified 5 proteins that significantly differed between the two groups. CDCP1 was the most significant (FDR adjusted p-value 0.006). Correlation with CDCP1 concentration was most significant for CD34+ concentration and nucleated cell count. Multivariate analysis showed that CD34 and gender seemed to influence the level of CDCP1. In conclusion, CDCP1 was identified as a potential biomarker of HSPC content in CB. The finding also warrants further investigation for a possible role of CDCP1 in regulating HSPC presence in CB.

Abstract: Heart failure arises from diverse cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, ischemic disease and atherosclerosis, valvular insufficiency, myocarditis, and contractile protein mutations. MicroRNAs are dysregulated in heart failure, but identification of the specific microRNAs involved remains incomplete. Here, we evaluate miR-25 expression in the peripheral blood from healthy, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), remote infarct (OMI), hypertensive heart disease (HHD), and HHD resulting in heart failure (HHDF) using q-PCR. Interestingly, we discovered miR-25 expression in humans is initially decreased at the onset of heart failure but is later increased in end-stage heart failure. We also show that overexpression of miR-25 in normal mice causes cardiomyocyte fibrosis and apoptosis. However, inhibition of miR-25 in normal mice led to activate renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and high blood pressure, mild heart dilation. Notably, the miR-25 cluster knock-out mice was also characterized high blood pressure and no obvious cardiac function alteration. RNA sequencing showed the alteration of miR-25 target genes in angomir-treated mice, including the renin secretion signal related gene. In vitro, cotransfection with the miR-25 antagomir repressed luciferase activity from a reporter construct containing the Pde3a and Cacnalc untranslated region. In summary, miR-25 expression during different stages of heart disease, offers a new perspective for the role of miR-25 function in heart failure.

Abstract: Summary
Photoreceptor degenerative diseases are a major cause of blindness for which cell replacement is one of the most encouraging strategies. For stem cell-based therapy using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), it is crucial to obtain a homogenous photoreceptor cell population. We confirmed that the cell surface antigen CD73 is exclusively expressed in hiPSC-derived photoreceptors by generating a fluorescent cone rod homeobox (Crx) reporter hiPSC line using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We demonstrated that CD73 targeting by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) is an effective strategy to separate a safe population of transplantable photoreceptors. CD73+ photoreceptor precursors can be isolated in large numbers and transplanted into rat eyes, showing capacity to survive and mature in close proximity to host inner retina of a model of photoreceptor degeneration. These data demonstrate that CD73+ photoreceptor precursors hold great promise for a future safe clinical translation.

Abstract: Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) has potential to attenuate pulmonary inflammation and injury. As a pivotal paracrine entity of stem cells, whether EPC-derived exosomes (EPC-Exos) contribute to acute lung injury (ALI) remains unknown. Exosomes were purified from conditional medium of EPCs, and then characterized by electron micrograph and immunoblotting. A model of ALI was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then rats were transplanted with EPC-Exos. The underlying mechanisms of action of EPC-Exos were examined in vitro endothelial functional assays including the TEER, proliferation (CKK-8), angiogenesis and migration. A possible underlying mechanism was examined by western blotting and further animal studies. Administration of EPC-Exos ameliorated LPS-induced ALI and restored the in vivo pulmonary integrity. EPC-Exos enhanced the proliferation, migration and tube formation of the endothelial cells (ECs). Furthermore, we found that miR-126 was enriched in EPC-Exos and can be delivered onto ECs. Modification of EPCs through miR-126 knockdown can diminish their exosomes function in vitro, indicative of the abilities of EPC-Exos to protect against LPS were inherited by the horizontal shuttled miR-126. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-126 could target SPRED1. Additionally, the miR-126 transferred to target endothelial cells resulted in subsequent downregulation of SPRED1 and promoted RAF/ERK signaling pathways and subsequent improvement in endothelial cell function. Our study revealed a novel role of exosomal miRNAs in EPC-mediated therapy, suggesting that the clinical application of EPC-Exos might represent a strategy in ALI/ARDS.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanism underpinning the specification of the ectoderm, a transient germ-layer tissue, during mouse gastrulation was examined here in a stem cell-based model. We captured a self-renewing cell population with enhanced ectoderm potency from mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) by suppressing Nodal signaling activity. The transcriptome of the Nodal-inhibited EpiSCs resembles that of the anterior epiblast of embryonic day (E)7.0 and E7.5 mouse embryo, which is accompanied by chromatin modifications that reflect the priming of ectoderm lineage-related genes for expression. Nodal-inhibited EpiSCs show enhanced ectoderm differentiation in vitro and contribute to the neuroectoderm and the surface ectoderm in postimplantation chimeras but lose the propensity for mesendoderm differentiation in vitro and in chimeras. Our findings show that specification of the ectoderm progenitors is enhanced by the repression of Nodal signaling activity, and the ectoderm-like stem cells provide an experimental model to investigate the molecular characters of the epiblast-derived ectoderm.

Abstract: Although anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) therapy has shown light in treatment of gastric cancer, only a limited number of patients respond to the treatment. In addition to its immunosuppressive effect, PD-L1 is involved in other functions of tumor cells. Previously study showed that PD-L1 promoted EMT in lung cancer cells. However, the other effect and role of PD-L1 in gastric cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we first demonstrated that PD-L1 promoted the proliferation and migration in gastric cancer cell lines. We found that another STAT family member, STAT5a, is involved in regulating the expression of PD-L1 in gastric cancer. Additionally, Cbl-b interacted and ubiquitated STAT5a, down-regulated the expression of STAT5a and PD-L1. Moreover, bioinformatics predictions and experimental data showed that Cbl-b is a target gene of the microRNA miR-940. We further found that miR-940 promoted the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-940/Cbl-b/STAT5a axis regulated the expression of PD-L1, which promotes the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
We previously identified an immunomodulatory role of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in asthmatic inflammation. Mitochondrial transfer from bone marrow MSCs to epithelial cells can result in the attenuation of acute lung injury in mice. However, the effects of mitochondrial transfer from iPSC-MSCs to epithelial cells in asthma and the mechanisms underlying these effects are unclear. We found that iPSC-MSC transplantation significantly reduced T helper 2 cytokines, attenuated the mitochondrial dysfunction of epithelial cells, and alleviated asthma inflammation in mice. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) were formed between iPSC-MSCs and epithelial cells, and mitochondrial transfer from iPSC-MSCs to epithelial cells via TNTs was observed both in vitro and in mice. Overexpression or silencing of connexin 43 (CX43) in iPSC-MSCs demonstrated that CX43 plays a critical role in the regulation of TNT formation by mediating mitochondrial transfer between iPSC-MSCs and epithelial cells. This study provides a therapeutic strategy for targeting asthma inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
In response to environmental and other stresses, the σ54 subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) controls expression of several genes that play a significant role in the virulence of both plant and animal pathogens. Recruitment of σ54 to RNAP initiates promoter-specific transcription via the double-stranded DNA denaturation mechanism of the cofactor. The RpoN box, a recognition helix found in the C-terminal region of σ54, has been identified as the component necessary for major groove insertion at the −24 position of the promoter. We employed the hydrocarbon stapled peptide methodology to design and synthesize stapled σ54 peptides capable of penetrating Gram-negative bacteria, binding the σ54 promoter, and blocking the interaction between endogenous σ54 and its target DNA sequence, thereby reducing transcription and activation of σ54 response genes.

Endoplasmic reticulum stress-dependent ROS production mediates synovial myofibroblastic differentiation in the immobilization-induced rat knee joint contracture model,

Abstract: Joint contracture is a common complication for people with joint immobility that involves fibrosis structural alteration in the joint capsule. Considering that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays a prominent role in the promotion of tissue fibrosis, we investigated whether the unfolded protein response (UPR) contributes to the fibrotic development in immobilization-induced knee joint contractures. Using a non-traumatic rat knee joint contracture model, twelve female Sprague-Dawley rats received knee joint immobilization for a period of 8 weeks. We found that fibrosis protein markers (type I collagen, α-SMA) and UPR (GRP78, ATF6α, XBP1s) markers were parallelly upregulated in rat primary cultured synovial myofibroblasts. In the same cell types, pre-treatment with an ER stress inhibitor, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), not only abrogated cytokine TGFβ1 stimulation but also reduced the protein level of UPR. Additionally, high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was detected in synovial myofibroblasts through flow cytometry, as expected. Notably, TGFβ1-induced UPR was significantly reduced through the inhibition of ROS with antioxidants. These data suggest that ER stress act as a pro-fibrotic stimulus through the overexpression of ROS in synovial fibroblasts. Interestingly, immunohistochemical results showed an increase in the UPR protein levels both in human acquired joint contractures capsule tissue and in animal knee joint contracture tissue. Together, our findings suggest that ER stress contributes to synovial myofibroblastic differentiation in joint capsule fibrosis and may also serve as a potential therapeutic target in joint contractures.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we provide structural insights into PyrE3, a flavin-dependent [4 + 2] cyclase that catalyzes trans-decalin formation in the biosynthesis of pyrroindomycins. PyrE3 shares an architecture/domain organization head-to-tail similarity with the members of the family of para-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (pHBH)-fold monooxygenases, and possesses a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain, a middle domain, and a C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain. The FAD-binding domain forms a central hub of the protein structure, and binds with FAD in a “closed” conformation of pHBH-fold family monooxygenases known for their highly dynamic catalytic processes. FAD plays an essential structural role in PyrE3, where it is amenable to redox change; however, redox change has little effect on [4 + 2] cyclization activity. PyrE3 appears to selectively accommodate a tetramate-containing, linear polyene intermediate in a highly positively charged pocket, which is located at the interface between the FAD-binding domain and the middle domain, and can accelerate trans-decalin formation likely through an endo-selective [4 + 2] transition state.

Abstract: Background
Annexin A1 (ANXA1) and Translocator Protein-18KDa (TSPO) down-regulate neuroinflammation. We investigated the role of recombinant ANXA1 (rANXA) on TSPO functions on Toll Like Receptor (TLR) activated microglia.
Methods
BV-2 cells (murine microglia), were stimulated by E. coli Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treated with rANXA1 in order to measure TSPO expression and inflammatory parameters. Anti-sense ANXA1 and TLR4 and TSPO shRNA, as well as pharmacological treatments, were employed to assess the mechanisms involved.
Results
LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells caused overexpression of TSPO, which was inhibited by: pharmacological blockade of TLR4 or TLR4 mRNA silencing; inhibition of myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) dimerization; or blocking of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. rANXA1 treatment impaired LPS-induced TSPO upregulation by down-modulating MyD88 and NF-κB signaling; the effect was abolished by WRW4, an antagonist of formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2). rANXA1 treatment also downregulated interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) secretion in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells. TSPO knockdown in BV-2 cells augmented LPS-induced TNFα secretion and abolished the inhibitory effect of rANXA1 on TNFα secretion evoked by LPS.
Conclusions
exogenous ANXA1 down-modulates LPS-induced TSPO via MyD-88/NF-κB pathways, and constitutive TSPO is pivotal for the control of ANXA1 on TNFα secretion. TSPO actions may be involved with the mechanisms of ANXA1 on inflammatory brain diseases.

Abstract: Cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) are an invaluable tool for both basic and translational cardiovascular research. The potential that these cells hold for therapy, disease modeling and drug discovery is hampered by several bottlenecks that currently limit both the yield and the efficiency of cardiac induction. Here, we present a complete workflow for the production of ready-to-use hiPSC-CMs in a dynamic suspension bioreactor. This includes the efficient and highly reproducible differentiation of hiPSCs into cardiospheres, which display enhanced physiological maturation compared to static 3D induction in hanging drops, and a novel papain-based dissociation method that offers higher yield and viability than the broadly used dissociation reagents TrypLE and Accutase. Molecular and functional analyses of the cardiomyocytes reseeded after dissociation confirmed both the identity and the functionality of the cells, which can be used in downstream applications, either as monolayers or spheroids.

Abstract: Macrophage polarization plays a crucial role in regulating myocardial inflammation and injuries of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced viral myocarditis (VM). It has been reported that miR-223 is a potent regulator of inflammatory responses that involved in macrophage polarization. However, the functional roles of miR-223 in CVB3-induced VM still remain unknown. Here, we found that miR-223 expression was significantly down-regulated in heart tissues and heart-infiltrating macrophages of CVB3-infected mice. Up-regulation of miR-223 in vivo protected the mice against CVB3-induced myocardial injuries characterized by the increased body weight and survival, enhanced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS), relieved inflammation, depressed creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, reduced production of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)− 6 as well as increased IL-10. We subsequently found that miR-233 up-regulation significantly suppressed the expression of M1 markers (iNOS, TNF-α and CD 86), and promoted the expression of M2 markers (Arginase-1, Fizz-1 and CD 206) in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we confirmed that miR-223 directly targeted Pknox1 to inhibit its expression, and the expression of Pknox1 was inversely correlated with miR-223 expression in heart tissues and heart-infiltrating macrophages of CVB3-infected mice. Gain-of-function analyses indicated that Pknox1 overexpression partially reversed the polarization phenotypes regulated by miR-223 overexpression. Taken together, the data suggest that miR-223 protects against CVB3-induced inflammation and myocardial damage, which may partly attribute to the regulation of macrophage polarization via targeting Pknox1.

Abstract: Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders. Mounting studies have suggested an involvement of angiogenesis signaling in NHLs progression and resistance to treatment. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of CS2164, a novel receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor selectively targeting VEGFR-2 and Aurora B in NHL cells. By in vitro culture system and in vivo xenograft model, we found that CS2164 significantly inhibited cell growth and abolished clonogenicity in NHL cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, CS2164 significantly induced NHL cells apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Moreover, CS2164 suppressed NHL cells growth and progression in an in vivo xenograft model. Mechanistically, CS2164-induced cytotoxicity was closely associated with inhibition of VEGFR2 and Aurora B as well as their downstream signaling cascades, including P38, ERK and H3 pathways. In conclusion, CS2164 exerts its cytotoxic effect via inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis by modulating VEGFR2 and Aurora B signaling pathway, supporting a potential role for CS2164 in the treatment of NHLs.

Abstract: Orosomucoid 1-like protein 3 (ORMDL3) is an asthma candidate gene associated with virus-triggered recurrent wheeze. Stimulator of interferon gene (STING) controls TLR-independent cytosolic responses to viruses. However, the association of STING with ORMDL3 is unclear. Here, we have shown that ORMDL3 expression shows a linear correlation with STING in recurrent wheeze patients. In elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the ORMDL3-STING relationship, we found that STING promoted the transcriptional activity of ORMDL3, which was significantly associated with increased levels of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). Further study showed that via activation of TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), STING enhanced the phosphorylation and binding of IRF3 and STAT6, which upregulated ORMDL3 by binding to the promoter. Our results showed that STING positively regulated ORMDL3 through the TBK1-IRF3-STAT6 complex.

Abstract: Mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin1 result in overproduction and accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, which has been shown to play an important role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Carvedilol, a nonselective β-adrenergic receptor blocker used for treatment for heart failure and hypertension, has displayed its neuroprotective capacity due to its antioxidant property. In this study, we investigated whether Carvedilol has a neuronal protective effect against endogenous Aβ neurotoxicity in mouse Neuro2a (N2a) cells transfected with Swedish amyloid precursor protein (Swe-APP) mutant and Presenilin exon9 deletion mutant (N2a/Swe.D9). Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein carbonyls, and 4-HNE were found in N2a/Swe.D9 cells, which were ameliorated by administration of Carvedilol in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the levels of ATP and mitochondrial membrane potential were reduced in N2a/Swe.D9 cells, which were restored by treatment with Carvedilol. N2a/Swe.D9 cells displayed increased vulnerability to H2O2-induced cell death and apoptosis, which could be attenuated by Carvedilol. Mechanistically, we found that Carvedilol prevented apoptosis signals through reducing cytochrome C release and the level of cleaved caspase-3. Taken together, our findings suggest a possible use of Carvedilol in AD treatment.

Abstract: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are involved in diabetes-associated complications, including diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). Recent reports showed that miR-155 downregulation promotes wound healing in diabetic rats and ameliorates endothelial injury induced by high glucose, but its role in DFU is unknown. We found that miR-155 was overexpressed in EPCs from patients with DFU and in high glucose–induced EPCs from healthy people. Reductions in cell viability, migration, tube formation and nitric oxide production, as well as increases in lactated hydrogenase, cell apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species induced by high glucose, were enhanced by miR-155 overexpression and restrained by miR-155 inhibition. Additionally, dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-155 directly targeted the 3′ untranslated region of patched-1 (PTCH1), a receptor of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, and downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of PTCH1. qRT-PCR and Western blot results revealed that the PTCH1 was downregulated in EPCs treated with high glucose. Silencing PTCH1 by PTCH1 siRNA alleviated the protective effect of anti-miR-155 on high glucose–induced EPC dysfunction. Our results indicate that miR-155 worsened high glucose–induced EPC function by downregulating PTCH1. These findings suggest that miR-155 may be a potential therapeutic target for DFU.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles are submicron vesicles that upregulate the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators by lung epithelial cells. We investigated whether these structures adhere to lung epithelial cells, and whether adhesion is a prerequisite for their proinflammatory activity. Extracellular vesicles were generated by stimulation of normal human mononuclear cells with the calcium ionophore A23187, and labelled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester. Adhesion of vesicles to monolayers of immortalized bronchial epithelial (16HBE) and alveolar (A549) cells was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The role of candidate adhesion receptors was evaluated with inhibitory monoclonal antibodies and soluble peptides. The synthesis of proinflammatory mediators was assessed by ELISA. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the generation of closed vesicles with an approximate size range between 50 and 600 nm. Adhesion of extracellular vesicles to epithelial cells was upregulated upon stimulation of the latter with tumor necrosis factor-α. Adhesion was blocked by an anti-CD18 antibody, by peptides containing the sequence RGD and, to a lesser extent, by an antibody to ICAM-1. The same molecules also blocked the upregulation of the synthesis of interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 induced by extracellular vesicles. CD18-mediated adhesion of extracellular vesicles is a prerequisite for their proinflammatory activity.

Abstract: Endothelia inflammation damage is vital to the development and progression of chronic venous disease. In the present study, we explored the protective effect of melatonin on endothelia apoptosis induced by LPS, particularly focusing on the mitochondrial fission. We demonstrated that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) subjected to LPS for 12 h exhibited a higher apoptotic rate. However, melatonin (1–20 μM) treatment 12 h before LPS had the ability to protect HUVEC cell against LPS-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, LPS induced the cytoplasmic calcium overload which was responsible for the upregulation of calcium-dependent xanthine oxidase (XO). Higher XO expression was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, leading to the Drp1 phosphorylation at the Ser616 site and migration on the surface of mitochondria. Furthermore, phosphorylated Drp1 initiated the mitochondrial fission contributing to the caspase9-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis as evidenced by lower membrane potential, more cyt-c leakage into the nuclear, and higher expression of proapoptotic proteins. However, melatonin treatment could trigger the AMPK pathway, which was followed by the increased SERCA2a expression. Activation of AMPK/SERCA2a by melatonin inhibited the calcium overload, XO-mediated ROS outburst, Drp1-required mitochondrial fission, and final mitochondrial apoptosis. In summary, this study confirmed that LPS induced HUVEC apoptosis through Ca2+-XO-ROS-Drp1-mitochondrial fission axis and that melatonin reduced the apoptosis of HUVEC through activation of the AMPK/SERCA2a pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Marking replicating DNA with multiple labels presents the possibility of revealing new features and mechanisms of DNA synthesis and cell division; however, progression beyond double labeling has been hampered by cross-reactivity of label detection and scarcity of appropriate labels. Here, we present a method for triple S-phase labeling of the dividing cells, with a fourth label used to mark cells actively engaged in cell-cycle progression (e.g., using Ki67) or to phenotype the dividing cells or their progeny (e.g., using a GFP-expressing lineage reporter transgene). We apply this method to determine the parameters of neural stem cell division in the adult brain, to birth date up to four cohorts of dividing cells, and to reveal patterns of stem cell division in non-neural tissues.

Abstract: Mutations in MECP2 gene have been identified in more than 95% of patients with classic Rett syndrome, one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in females. Taking advantage of the breakthrough technology of genetic reprogramming, we investigated transcriptome changes in neurons differentiated from induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with different mutations. Profiling by RNA-seq in terminally differentiated neurons revealed a prominent GABAergic circuit disruption along with a perturbation of cytoskeleton dynamics. In particular, in mutated neurons we identified a significant decrease of acetylated α-tubulin which can be reverted by treatment with selective inhibitors of HDAC6, the main α-tubulin deacetylase. These findings contribute to shed light on Rett pathogenic mechanisms and provide hints for the treatment of Rett-associated epileptic behavior as well as for the definition of new therapeutic strategies for Rett syndrome.

Abstract: Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common solid tumors in children. High-risk NB remains lethal in about 50% of patients despite comprehensive and intensive treatments. Activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway correlates with oncogenesis, poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance in NB. Due to its central role in growth and metabolism, mTOR seems to be an important factor in NB, making it a possible target for NB. In this study, we investigated the effect of AZD8055, a potent dual mTORC1-mTORC2 inhibitor, in NB cell lines. Our data showed that mTOR signaling was extensively activated in NB cells. The activity of mTOR and downstream molecules were down-regulated in AZD8055-treated NB cells. Significantly, AZD8055 effectively inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest, autophagy and apoptosis in NB cells. Moreover, AZD8055 significantly reduced tumor growth in mice xenograft model without apparent toxicity. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of mTOR as a promising target for NB treatment. Therefore, AZD8055 may be further investigated for treatment in clinical trials for high risk NB.

Abstract: Summary
Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in GRIN2B, a subunit of the NMDA receptor, cause intellectual disability and language impairment. We developed clonal models of GRIN2B deletion and loss-of-function mutations in a region coding for the glutamate binding domain in human cells and generated neurons from a patient harboring a missense mutation in the same domain. Transcriptome analysis revealed extensive increases in genes associated with cell proliferation and decreases in genes associated with neuron differentiation, a result supported by extensive protein analyses. Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we demonstrate that NMDA receptors are present on neural progenitor cells and that human mutations in GRIN2B can impair calcium influx and membrane depolarization even in a presumed undifferentiated cell state, highlighting an important role for non-synaptic NMDA receptors. It may be this function, in part, which underlies the neurological disease observed in patients with GRIN2B mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare and intractable disorder characterized by extraskeletal bone formation through endochondral ossification. FOP patients harbor gain-of-function mutations in ACVR1 (FOP-ACVR1), a type I receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins. Despite numerous studies, no drugs have been approved for FOP. Here, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) system focused on the constitutive activation of FOP-ACVR1 by utilizing a chondrogenic ATDC5 cell line that stably expresses FOP-ACVR1. After HTS of 5,000 small-molecule compounds, we identified two hit compounds that are effective at suppressing the enhanced chondrogenesis of FOP patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (FOP-iPSCs) and suppressed the heterotopic ossification (HO) of multiple model mice, including FOP-ACVR1 transgenic mice and HO model mice utilizing FOP-iPSCs. Furthermore, we revealed that one of the hit compounds is an mTOR signaling modulator that indirectly inhibits mTOR signaling. Our results demonstrate that these hit compounds could contribute to future drug repositioning and the mechanistic analysis of mTOR signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Several studies have reported endothelial cell (EC) derivation from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). However, few have explored their functional properties in depth with respect to line-to-line and batch-to-batch variability and how they relate to primary ECs. We therefore carried out accurate characterization of hiPSC-derived ECs (hiPSC-ECs) from multiple (non-integrating) hiPSC lines and compared them with primary ECs in various functional assays, which included barrier function using real-time impedance spectroscopy with an integrated assay of electric wound healing, endothelia-leukocyte interaction under physiological flow to mimic inflammation and angiogenic responses in in vitro and in vivo assays. Overall, we found many similarities but also some important differences between hiPSC-derived and primary ECs. Assessment of vasculogenic responses in vivo showed little difference between primary ECs and hiPSC-ECs with regard to functional blood vessel formation, which may be important in future regenerative medicine applications requiring vascularization.

Abstract: Precise genome editing in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) significantly enhances our capability to use human iPSCs for disease modeling, drug testing and screening as well as investigation of human cell biology. In this study, we seek to achieve conditional expression of the CD55 gene in order to interrogate its functions. We used two human iPSC lines that have unique genotypes, and constructed an inducible Cas9 gene expression system that is integrated at the AAVS1 safe harbor site in the human genome. Using paired guide RNAs, we observed efficient knock-out with an intended deletion in the coding region of several genes including CD55 and ETV6 genes. This paired guide RNA approach enabled us to efficiently identify homozygous iPSC clones with an intended deletion. Once an iPSC clone lacking CD55 expression was identified and characterized, we were able to use the same doxycycline system to induce expression of a CD55 transgene from a piggyBac vector, in both undifferentiated and differentiated iPSCs. This single cell line of gene knock-out complemented with an inducible transgene is sufficient to achieve conditional expression of the CD55 gene. The methodology described here is broadly applicable to other genes in order to interrogate their functions.

Abstract: The skin's permeability barrier consists of stacked lipid sheets of splayed ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids, positioned intercellularly in the stratum corneum. We report here on the early stage of skin barrier formation taking place inside the tubuloreticular system in the secretory cells of the topmost viable epidermis and in the intercellular space between viable epidermis and stratum corneum. The barrier formation process was analysed in situ in its near-native state, using cryo-EM combined with molecular dynamics modeling and EM simulation. Stacks of lamellae appear towards the periphery of the tubuloreticular system and they are closely associated with granular regions. Only models based on a bicontinuous cubic phase organization proved compatible with the granular cryo-EM patterns. Only models based on a dehydrated lamellar phase organization agreed with the lamellar cryo-EM patterns. The data support that human skin barrier formation takes place via a cubic to lamellar lipid phase transition.

Abstract: Chronic inflammatory pain is a severe clinical problem that greatly affects patients’ quality of life and causes huge economic burden. Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation exerts critical roles in the pathogenic progression of inflammatory pain. Recent evidence corroborates the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective efficacy of glycyrrhizin; however, its function in inflammatory pain remains poorly elucidated. In the present study, glycyrrhizin suppressed LPS-induced activation of microglial cell BV2 by inhibiting NO production and expression of microglial marker IBA-1. Intriguingly, LPS-induced high expression and generation of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β) was notably reversed by glycyrrhizin pre-treatment. Mechanistic analysis confirmed that high expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in LPS-activated microglia was inhibited following glycyrrhizin. More importantly, restoring HMGB1 expression by recombinant adenovirus vector of Ad-HMGB1 counteracted glycyrrhizin-restrained inflammatory response in microglia upon LPS stimulation. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin dampened the activation of subsequent TLR4-NF-κB pathway in LPS-stimulated microglia, which was abrogated by HMGB1 elevation. Furthermore, blocking this pathway by si-TLR4 transfection reversed the effects of HMGB1 overexpression on the inhibitor roles of glycyrrhizin in microglia-triggered inflammation. Additionally, glycyrrhizin administration also alleviated CFA-evoked mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in inflammatory pain model of mice, concomitant with suppression in inflammatory response and microglial activation. Simultaneously, elevation of HMGB1, TLR4 and p65-NF-κB protein expression induced by CFA injection was also abrogated after glycyrrhizin. Accordingly, this study reveal that glycyrrhizin may act as a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of inflammatory pain.

Abstract: Summary
Human neural development begins at embryonic day 19 and marks the beginning of organogenesis. Neural stem cells in the neural tube undergo profound functional, morphological, and metabolic changes during neural specification, coordinated by a combination of exogenous and endogenous cues. The temporal cell signaling activities that mediate this process, during development and in the postnatal brain, are incompletely understood. We have applied gene expression studies and transcription factor-activated reporter lentiviruses during in vitro neural specification of human pluripotent stem cells. We show that nuclear factor κB orchestrates a multi-faceted metabolic program necessary for the maturation of neural progenitor cells during neurogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cellular function in various cell types. Although the role of mTORC1 in skeletogenesis has been investigated previously, here we show a critical role of mTORC1/4E-BPs/SOX9 axis in regulating skeletogenesis through its expression in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. Inactivation of Raptor, a component of mTORC1, in limb buds before mesenchymal condensations resulted in a marked loss of both cartilage and bone. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that mTORC1 selectively controls the RNA translation of Sox9, which harbors a 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine tract motif, via inhibition of the 4E-BPs. Indeed, introduction of Sox9 or a knockdown of 4E-BP1/2 in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells markedly rescued the deficiency of the condensation observed in Raptor-deficient mice. Furthermore, introduction of the Sox9 transgene rescued phenotypes of deficient skeletal growth in Raptor-deficient mice. These findings highlight a critical role of mTORC1 in mammalian skeletogenesis, at least in part, through translational control of Sox9 RNA.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus is a commensal bacterium that can asymptomatically colonize its host but also causes invasive infections. Quorum sensing regulates S. aureus virulence and the transition from a commensal to a pathogenic organism. However, little is known about how host innate immunity affects interbacterial communication. We show that nitric oxide suppresses staphylococcal virulence by targeting the Agr quorum sensing system. Nitric oxide-mediated inhibition occurs through direct modification of cysteine residues C55, C123, and C199 of the AgrA transcription factor. Cysteine modification decreases AgrA promoter occupancy as well as transcription of the agr operon and quorum sensing-activated toxin genes. In a staphylococcal pneumonia model, mice lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase develop more severe disease with heightened mortality and proinflammatory cytokine responses. In addition, staphylococcal α-toxin production increases in the absence of nitric oxide or nitric oxide-sensitive AgrA cysteine residues. Our findings demonstrate an anti-virulence mechanism for nitric oxide in innate immunity.

Abstract: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a complex disease with dysregulations in the immune system. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are professional B helper cells that are crucial to the development of antibody responses and are involved in a variety of diseases. In this study, we examined the circulating Tfh cells in patients with chronic HBV infection. We observed that CD3+CD4+CXCR5+ circulating Tfh cells contained a CD25+Foxp3+ Treg-like subset that was significantly enriched in patients with chronic HBV infections. The CD25+ Tfh subset presented distinctive cytokine secretion profile, such as lower interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)−17, and higher transforming growth factor (TGF)-β secretion, compared to the CD25- Tfh subset. When incubated with autologous naive CD10-CD27-CD19+ B cells, the CD25+ Tfh subset was less capable of mediating CD20-/loCD38+ plasmablast differentiation than the CD25- Tfh subset. In terms of Ig production, CD25+ Tfh cells were more potent at inducing IgM but less potent at inducing IgG and IgA than CD25- Tfh cells. Interestingly, B cells following incubation with CD25+ Tfh cells presented elevated regulatory function, with higher production of IL-10 and enhanced capacity of suppressing autologous CD8+ T cell inflammation. In the chronic HBV-infected patients, the frequency of IL-10+ B cells and the HBV viral load were positively correlated with the frequency of CD25+Foxp3+ CD4+CXCR5+ Tfh cells. Together, this study presented that CD25+Foxp3+ Treg-like Tfh cells were enriched in chronic HBV-infected patients and could promote regulatory B cell functions.

Abstract: Backcrossing together with simple sequence repeat marker strategy was adopted to improve popular Malaysian chilli Kulai (Capsicum annuum L.) for heat tolerance. The use of molecular markers in backcross breeding and selection contributes significantly to overcoming the main drawbacks such as increase linkage drag and time consumption, in the ancient manual breeding approach (conventional), and speeds up the genome recovery of the recurrent parent. The strategy was adopted to introgress heat shock protein gene(s) from AVPP0702 (C. annuum L.), which are heat-tolerant, into the genetic profile of Kulai, a popular high-yielding chilli but which is heat sensitive. The parents were grown on seed trays, and parental screening was carried out with 252 simple sequence repeat markers. The selected parents were crossed and backcrossed to generate F1 hybrids and backcross generations. Sixty-eight markers appeared to be polymorphic and were used to assess the backcross generation; BC1F1, BC2F1 and BC3F1. The average recipient allele of the selected four BC1F1 plants was 80.75% which were used to produce the BC2F1 generation. BC1-P7 was the best BC1F1 plant because it had the highest recovery at 83.40% and was positive to Hsp-linked markers (Hsp70-u2 and AGi42). After three successive generations of backcrossing, the average genome recovery of the recurrent parent in the selected plants in BC3F1 was 95.37%. Hsp gene expression analysis was carried out on BC1F1, BC2F1 and BC3F1 selected lines. The Hsp genes were found to be up-regulated when exposed to heat treatment. The pattern of Hsp expression in the backcross generations was similar to that of the donor parent. This confirms the successful introgression of a stress-responsive gene (Hsp) into a Kulai chilli pepper variety. Furthermore, the yield performance viz. plant height, number of fruits, fruit length and weight and total yield of the improved plant were similar with the recurrent parent except that the plant height was significantly lower than the Kulai (recurrent) parent.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process, plaque rupture and subsequent thrombosis underline the major causes of acute cardio-cerebral vascular diseases. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in diverse pathologic processes, including inflammation and myocardial infarction. Recent study confirmed the elevation of lncRNA growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) in atherosclerotic rats. In this study, we aimed to explore the role and mechanism of GAS5 in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque. Here, expression of GAS5 was enriched in atherosclerotic plaques and THP-1 macrophage exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). Furthermore, overexpression of GAS5 aggravated ox-LDL-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) and chemokine MCP-1 secretion in macrophages, which were reversed after GAS5 cessation. Additionally, high expression and secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were increased in ox-LDL-stimulated macrophages following GAS5 elevation, but these increases were inhibited in GAS5-silenced group. Mechanism analysis identified GAS5 as a endogenous sponge to directly bind and suppress miR-221 expression. Notably, miR-221 elevation antagonized GAS5-enhanced inflammatory response and MMPs in macrophages upon ox-LDL. These results suggest that GAS5 can trigger inflammatory response and MMP expression by acting as a sponge of miR-221, which may facilitate fibrous cap degradation and aggravate atherosclerotic plaque destabilization, supporting a promising therapeutic agent against atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Single-molecule fluorescence is widely used to study conformational complexity in proteins, and has proven especially valuable with intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Protein studies using dual-color single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) are now quite common, but many could benefit from simultaneous measurement of multiple distances through multi-color labeling. Such studies, however, have suffered from limitations in site-specific incorporation of more than two dyes per polypeptide. Here we present a fully site-specific three-color labeling scheme for α-synuclein, an IDP with important putative functions and links to Parkinson disease. The convergent synthesis combines native chemical ligation with regiospecific cysteine protection of expressed protein fragments to permit highly controlled labeling via standard cysteine-maleimide chemistry, enabling more global smFRET studies. Furthermore, this modular approach is generally compatible with recombinant proteins and expandable to accommodate even more complex experiments, such as by labeling with additional colors.

Abstract: Summary
The balance between factors leading to proliferation and differentiation of cortical neural precursors (CNPs) determines the correct cortical development. In this work, we show that GDNF and its receptor GFRα1 are expressed in the neocortex during the period of cortical neurogenesis. We show that the GDNF/GFRα1 complex inhibits the self-renewal capacity of mouse CNP cells induced by fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), promoting neuronal differentiation. While GDNF leads to decreased proliferation of cultured cortical precursor cells, ablation of GFRα1 in glutamatergic cortical precursors enhances its proliferation. We show that GDNF treatment of CNPs promoted morphological differentiation even in the presence of the self-renewal-promoting factor, FGF2. Analysis of GFRα1-deficient mice shows an increase in the number of cycling cells during cortical development and a reduction in dendrite development of cortical GFRα1-expressing neurons. Together, these results indicate that GDNF/GFRα1 signaling plays an essential role in regulating the proliferative condition and the differentiation of cortical progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Developing effective therapeutics for complex diseases such as late-onset, sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD) is difficult due to genetic and environmental heterogeneity in the human population and the limitations of existing animal models. Here, we used hiPSC-derived neurons to test a compound that stabilizes the retromer, a highly conserved multiprotein assembly that plays a pivotal role in trafficking molecules through the endosomal network. Using this human-specific system, we have confirmed previous data generated in murine models and show that retromer stabilization has a potentially beneficial effect on amyloid beta generation from human stem cell-derived neurons. We further demonstrate that manipulation of retromer complex levels within neurons affects pathogenic TAU phosphorylation in an amyloid-independent manner. Taken together, our work demonstrates that retromer stabilization is a promising candidate for therapeutic development in AD and highlights the advantages of testing novel compounds in a human-specific, neuronal system.

Abstract: Summary
Progress toward understanding Zika virus (ZIKV) pathogenesis is hindered by lack of immunocompetent small animal models, in part because ZIKV fails to effectively antagonize Stat2-dependent interferon (IFN) responses in mice. To address this limitation, we first passaged an African ZIKV strain (ZIKV-Dak-41525) through Rag1−/− mice to obtain a mouse-adapted virus (ZIKV-Dak-MA) that was more virulent than ZIKV-Dak-41525 in mice treated with an anti-Ifnar1 antibody. A G18R substitution in NS4B was the genetic basis for the increased replication, and resulted in decreased IFN-β production, diminished IFN-stimulated gene expression, and the greater brain infection observed with ZIKV-Dak-MA. To generate a fully immunocompetent mouse model of ZIKV infection, human STAT2 was introduced into the mouse Stat2 locus (hSTAT2 KI). Subcutaneous inoculation of pregnant hSTAT2 KI mice with ZIKV-Dak-MA resulted in spread to the placenta and fetal brain. An immunocompetent mouse model of ZIKV infection may prove valuable for evaluating countermeasures to limit disease.

Abstract: Summary
To discriminate the patient subpopulations with different clinical outcomes within each breast cancer (BC) subtype, we introduce a robust, clinical-practical, activity-based proteogenomic method that identifies, in their oncogenically active states, candidate biomarker genes bearing patient-specific transcriptomic/genomic alterations of prognostic value. First, we used the intronic splicing enhancer (ISE) probes to sort ISE-interacting trans-acting protein factors (trans-interactome) directly from a tumor tissue for subsequent mass spectrometry characterization. In the retrospective, proteogenomic analysis of patient datasets, we identified those ISE trans-factor-encoding genes showing interaction-correlated expression patterns (iCEPs) as new BC-subtypic genes. Further, patient-specific co-alterations in mRNA expression of select iCEP genes distinguished high-risk patient subsets/subpopulations from other patients within a single BC subtype. Function analysis further validated a tumor-phenotypic trans-interactome contained the drivers of oncogenic splicing switches, representing the predominant tumor cells in a tissue, from which novel personalized biomarkers were clinically characterized/validated for precise prognostic prediction and subsequent individualized alignment of optimal therapy.

Abstract: Background
The use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) as growth supplement for human cell and tissue culture is widely spread in basic research as well as in clinical approaches, although several limitations must be considered, such as unstable composition and availability, biosafety and ethical aspects. Regarding interspecies differences, xenogeneic growth factors may evoke incompatibilities and non-desired interactions with human cells resulting in imprecise outcome of human-relevant data.
Methods
In this study the functionality of human serum (HS) has been investigated in comparison to FBS by assessing proliferation, migration and invasion of the human cervical cancer cell lines SiHa and HeLa. The effects of both sera on spheroid formation were analyzed microscopically.
Results
Both, FBS and HS, stimulate cell proliferation and migration similarly, whereas HS significantly enhanced cell invasion. The spheroid formation assay revealed remarkable differences between both sera, especially for SiHa cells. While in FBS supplemented medium cells only formed loose aggregates, HS induced regularly shaped spheroids under all tested conditions.
Conclusion
We were able to demonstrate that HS and FBS differently influence behavior of cells in culture which may have an impact on experimental results, especially in 3D cultures.

Abstract: HER2 overexpression accounts for approximately 15–20% of all breast cancers. We have shown that HER2 overexpression leads to elevated expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in breast cancer cells. In this study, firstly, we showed that AhR expression was up-regulated by treatment with the HER3 ligand heregulin (HRG) in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines. Induction of AhR was mediated by transcriptional activation of the region of AhR promoter corresponding to − 190 to − 100 bp. In addition, HRG treatment elicited nuclear translocation of AhR. To investigate the role of AhR in HRG-HER2/HER3 signaling in HER2-overexpressing cells, we established AhR knockout (KO) HER2-overexpressing cells to perform wound-healing assays. HRG-induced cell migration was markedly attenuated by AhR KO. HRG-induced cell migration was associated with increased expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in wild type cells, but not in AhR KO cells. These results elucidate that AhR is an important factor for the malignancy in HER2 overexpressing breast cancers.

Abstract: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are markedly increased in cancer patients and tumor-bearing mice and promote tumor growth and survival by inhibiting host innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, we generated and characterized MDSCs from murine-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The iPSCs were co-cultured with OP9 cells, stimulated with GM-CSF, and became morphologically heterologous under co-culturing with hepatic stellate cells. Allogeneic and OVA-specific antigen stimulation demonstrated that iPS-MDSCs have a T-cell regulatory function. Furthermore, a popliteal lymph node assay and autoimmune hepatitis model showed that iPS-MDSCs also regulate immune responsiveness in vivo and have a therapeutic effect against hepatitis. Taken together, our results demonstrated a method of generating functional MDSCs from iPSCs and highlighted the potential of iPS-MDSCs as a key cell therapy resource for transplantation and autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: The continuously decreasing willingness for liver donation aggravates treatment of end-stage liver diseases requiring organ transplantation as the only curative strategy. Cell therapy approaches using human hepatocytes or stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells may be a therapeutic option out of this dilemma. ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stromal cells from human skin featured promising potential to treat immune-mediated diseases. Since most of chronic liver diseases involve exaggerating immune mechanisms, it was the aim to demonstrate in this study, whether ABCB5+ stem cells may serve as a resource to generate hepatocytic cells for application in liver cell transplantation. Using an established single-step protocol, which had been successfully applied to differentiate mesenchymal stromal cells into the hepatocytic lineage, ABCB5+ skin-derived stem cells did not gain significant characteristics of hepatocytes. Yet, upon culture in hepatocytic differentiation medium, ABCB5+ stem cells secreted immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic factors as well as proteins, which may prompt hepatic morphogenesis besides others. Hepatic transplantation of ABCB5+ stem cells, which had been prior cultured in hepatocytic differentiation medium, did not cause any obvious deterioration of liver architecture suggesting their safe application. Thus, human ABCB5+ skin-derived stem cells secreted putative hepatotropic factors after culture in hepatocytic differentiation medium.

Abstract: Anoikis-resistance is an essential feature of cancer cells to obtain successful metastasis, whereas the molecular mechanism involved in this process of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells is not fully understood. Here we demonstrated that tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) 31, a new member of the TRIM family, was significantly upregulated in the anchorage-deprived HCC cells compared with their attached counterpart. When we blocked TRIM31 expression by its specific interference RNAs, the anoikis-resistance of HCC cells was significantly reversed. We further verified that overactivation of AMPK pathway was responsible for TRIM31-mediated resistance to anoikis of HCC cells; and TRIM31 could directly target p53, the upstream suppressor of AMPK pathway, and mediate K48-linked ubiquitous degradation of p53 in a RING-domain-dependent way. Therefore we demonstrated that TRIM31 promoted anoikis-resistance by targeting p53 for degradation and subsequently overactivating AMPK pathway. Thus our study defined for the first time the role of TRIM31 in the anoikis-resistant process of HCC cells， and it may pave a new avenue for manipulation of metastatic cancer by targeting TRIM31.

Abstract: Zebrafish hearts can regenerate through activation of growth factors and trans-differentiation of fibroblasts, epicardial, myocardial and endocardial cells, all positive for GATA4 during the process. A possible model of regeneration of the whole heart and the regenerating cells in ex-vivo culture is presented here by a stimulation of cocktail of growth factors. In ex-vivo growth-factors-supplemented culture the heart regeneration was quite complete without signs of fibrosis. Epicardial- and endocardial-derived cells have been analyzed by electron microscopy evidencing two main types: 1) larger/prismatic and 2) small/rounded. Type (1) showed on the surface protein-sculptures, while type(2) was smooth with sparse globular proteins. To confirm their nature we have contemporarily analyzed their proliferative capability and markers-positivity. The cells treated by growth factors have at least two-fold more proliferation with GATA4-positivity. The type (1) cell evidenced WT1+(marker of embryonic epicardium); the type (2) showed NFTA2+(marker of embryonic endocardium); whereas cTNT-cardiotroponin was negative. Under growth factors stimulation, GATA4+/WT1+ and GATA4+/NFTA2+ could be suitable candidates to be the cells with capability to move in/out of the tissue, probably by using their integrins, and it opens the possibility to have long term selected culture to future characterization.

Abstract: The physiological cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive condition without myocyte cell death, while pathological hypertrophy is a maladaptive condition associated with myocyte cell death. This study explores the miRNome of α-2M-induced physiologically hypertrophied cardiomyocytes and the role of miRNA-99 family during cardiac hypertrophy. Physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy was induced in H9c2 cardiomyoblast cell lines using α-2M and isoproterenol respectively. Total RNA isolation and small RNA sequencing were executed for physiological hypertrophy model. The differentially expressed miRNAs and its target mRNAs were validated in animal models. Transcription factor binding sites were predicted in the promoter of specific miRNAs and validated by ChIP-PCR. Subsequently, the selected miRNA was functionally characterized by overexpression and silencing. The effects of silencing of upstream regulator and downstream target gene were studied. Analysis of small RNA reads revealed the differential expression of a large set of miRNAs during hypertrophy, of which miR-99 family was highly downregulated upon α-2M treatment. However, this miR-99 family expression was upregulated during pathological hypertrophy and confirmed in animal models. ChIP-PCR confirms the binding of Egr-1 transcription factor to the miR-99 promoter. Further, silencing of Egr-1 decreased the expression of miR-99. The overexpression or silencing of miR-99 diverges the physiological hypertrophy to pathological hypertrophy and vice versa by regulating Akt-1 pathway. Silencing of Akt-1 replicates the effect of overexpression of miR-99.
Conclusion
The results proved Egr-1 mediated regulation of miR-99 family that plays a key role in determining the fate of cardiac hypertrophy by regulating Akt-1 signaling.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators in chemoresistance of various tumors including ovarian cancer. Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) has been reported to be upregulated and contributed to ovarian cancer tumorigenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the roles of MALAT1 and the underlying molecular regulatory mechanism in the chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells. Our data demonstrated that MALAT1 and Notch1 mRNA were upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues, as well as cisplatin (CDDP)-resistant ovarian cancer cells. A positive correlation between MALAT1 and Notch1 mRNA expression was observed. MALAT1 knockdown significantly attenuated CDDP resistance, and enhanced CDDP-induced apoptosis in CDDP-resistant ovarian cancer cells. MALAT1 knockdown enhanced CDDP-induced apoptosis in vivo, as indicated by upregulation of Bax protein expression and downregulation of Bcl-2 protein expression. Additionally, MALAT1 knockdown inhibited the Notch1 pathway and ABCC1 expression in CDDP-resistant ovarian cancer cells. MALAT1 was demonstrated to interact with Notch1. Notch1 knockdown attenuated CDDP resistance, and downregulated the protein expression of ABCC1 in ovarian cancer cells. Taken together, our findings suggested that knockdown of MALAT-1 enhanced chemosensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to CDDP through inhibiting Notch1 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Split inteins are expressed as two separated subunits (N-intein and C-intein) fused to the corresponding exteins. The specific association of both intein subunits precedes protein splicing, which results in excision of the intein subunits and in ligation, by a peptide bond, of the concomitant exteins. Catalytically active intein precursors are typically too reactive for crystallization or even isolation. Neq pol is the trans-intein of the B-type DNA polymerase I split gene from hyperthermophile Nanoarchaeum equitans. We have determined the crystal structures of both the isolated NeqN and the complex of NeqN and NeqC subunits carrying the wild-type sequences, including the essential catalytic residues Ser1 and Thr+1, in addition to seven and three residues of the N- and C-exteins, respectively. These structures provide detailed information on the unique oxyester chemistry of the splicing mechanism of Neq pol and of the extensive rearrangements that occur in NeqN during the association step.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies highlighted the importance of astrocytes in neuroinflammatory diseases, interacting closely with other CNS cells but also with the immune system. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining human astrocytes, their role in these pathologies is still poorly characterized. Here, we develop a serum-free protocol to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into astrocytes. Gene expression and functional assays show that our protocol consistently yields a highly enriched population of resting mature astrocytes across the 13 hiPSC lines differentiated. Using this model, we first highlight the importance of serum-free media for astrocyte culture to generate resting astrocytes. Second, we assess the astrocytic response to IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, all cytokines important in neuroinflammation, such as multiple sclerosis. Our study reveals very specific profiles of reactive astrocytes depending on the triggering stimulus. This model provides ideal conditions for in-depth and unbiased characterization of astrocyte reactivity in neuroinflammatory conditions.

Abstract: Ionizing radiation (IR) triggers the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which shows potential roles in damaging the DNA and proteins at the nucleus, and eventually results in apoptosis and even cell death. Antioxidant agents can inhibit the generation of ROS after IR exposure. Tannic acid (TA), has an antioxidant activity involving in preventing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However, little is known about the effects of TA on irradiation-induced apoptosis in megakaryocytes. Here, we evaluated the anti-radiation activity of TA in megakaryocytes. Our results showed that TA protected megakaryocytes from apoptosis induced by IR, attenuated IR-induced increases in the production of ROS, and inhibited the changes of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Moreover, TA down-regulated NAPDH oxidase 1 (Nox1) expression, and decreased the phosphorylated levels of JNK and p38. Furthermore, JNK inhibitor could reduce apoptosis induced by X-irradiation in M07e cells. In vivo experiments confirmed that TA could promote the platelet recovery, reduce the percentage of apoptosis CD41+ megakaryocytes in bone marrow and raise survival during 30 days in mice by total body irradiation. In conclusion, TA can protecte the megakaryocytes from apoptosis caused by IR through inhibiting Nox1 expression to reduce ROS generation and repressing JNK/p38 MAPK pathway activation.

Abstract: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X chromosome-linked disorder caused by a mutation in the dystrophin gene. Many previous studies reported that the skeletal muscles of DMD patients were more susceptible to oxidative stress than those of healthy people. However, not much has been known about the responsible mechanism of the differential susceptibility. In this study, we established dystrophin knock-down (DysKD) cell lines by transfection of dystrophin shRNA lentiviral particles into C2 cells and found that DysKD myotubes are more vulnerable to menadione-induced oxidative stress than control myotubes. We focused on the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) which is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of phase II antioxidant enzymes by binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE). Under menadione-induced oxidative stress, the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus is significantly decreased in the DysKD myotubes. In addition, the binding of Nrf2 to ARE site of Bcl-2 gene as well as protein expression of Bcl-2 is decreased compared to the control cells. Interestingly, sulforaphane increased Akt activation and Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus in the DysKD myotubes. These results suggest that the Nrf2 pathway might be the responsible pathway to the oxidative stress-induced muscle damage in DMD.

Abstract: Summary
Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) establishes infections in humans and mice, but some non-human primates exhibit resistance via unknown mechanisms. Innate immune recognition pathways are highly conserved but are pivotal in determining susceptibility to DNA virus infections. We report that variation of a single amino acid residue in the innate immune sensor cGAS determines species-specific inactivation by HSV-1. The HSV-1 UL37 tegument protein deamidates human and mouse cGAS. Deamidation impairs the ability of cGAS to catalyze cGAMP synthesis, which activates innate immunity. HSV-1 with deamidase-deficient UL37 promotes robust antiviral responses and is attenuated in mice in a cGAS- and STING-dependent manner. Mutational analyses identified a single asparagine in human and mouse cGAS that is not conserved in many non-human primates. This residue underpins UL37-mediated cGAS deamidation and species permissiveness of HSV-1. Thus, HSV-1 mediates cGAS deamidation for immune evasion and exploits species sequence variation to disarm host defenses.

Abstract: Summary
The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment consists of a small pool of cells capable of replenishing all blood cells. Although it is established that the hematopoietic system is assembled as a hierarchical organization under steady-state conditions, emerging evidence suggests that distinct differentiation pathways may exist in response to acute stress. However, it remains unclear how different hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell subpopulations behave under sustained chronic stress. Here, by using adult transgenic mice overexpressing erythropoietin (EPO; Tg6) and a combination of in vivo, in vitro, and deep-sequencing approaches, we found that HSCs respond differentially to chronic erythroid stress compared with their closely related multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Specifically, HSCs exhibit a vastly committed erythroid progenitor profile with enhanced cell division, while MPPs display erythroid and myeloid cell signatures and an accumulation of uncommitted cells. Thus, our results identify HSCs as master regulators of chronic stress erythropoiesis, potentially circumventing the hierarchical differentiation-detour.

Abstract: Abiotic stresses like drought, salinity, high and low temperature, and submergence are major factors that limit the crop productivity. Hence, identification of genes associated with stress response in crops is a prerequisite for improving their tolerance to adverse environmental conditions. In an earlier study, we had identified a drought-inducible gene, vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (TaVAP), in developing grains of wheat. In this study, we demonstrate that TaVAP is able to complement yeast and Arabidopsis mutants, which are impaired in their respective orthologs, signifying functional conservation. Constitutive expression of TaVAP in Arabidopsis imparted tolerance to water stress conditions without any apparent yield penalty. Enhanced tolerance to water stress was associated with maintenance of higher relative water content, photosynthetic efficiency, and antioxidant activities. Compared to wild type, the TaVAP-overexpressing plants showed enhanced lateral root proliferation that was attributed to higher endogenous levels of IAA. These studies are the first to demonstrate that TaVAP plays a critical role in growth and development in plants, and is a potential candidate for improving the abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants.

Abstract: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is generally divided into primary and secondary injuries, and apoptosis is an important event of the secondary injury. As an endogenous bile acid and recognized endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) administration has been reported to have a potentially therapeutic effect on neurodegenerative diseases, but its real mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we evaluated whether TUDCA could alleviate traumatic damage of the spinal cord and improve locomotion function in a mouse model of SCI. Traumatic SCI mice were intraperitoneally injected with TUDCA, and the effects were evaluated based on motor function assessment, histopathology, apoptosis detection, qRT-PCR, and western blot at different time periods. TUDCA administration can improve motor function and reduce secondary injury and lesion area after SCI. Furthermore, the apoptotic ratios were significantly reduced; Grp78, Erdj4, and CHOP were attenuated by the treatment. Unexpectedly, the levels of CIBZ, a novel therapeutic target for SCI, were specifically up-regulated. Taken together, it is suggested that TUDCA effectively suppressed ER stress through targeted up-regulation of CIBZ. This study also provides a new strategy for relieving secondary damage by inhibiting apoptosis in the early treatment of spinal cord injury.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of somatostatin (SST) analogue, Octreotide, on some features of liver injury induced by immobilization stress (IS) in adult male albino rats. Eighteen adult male albino rats were randomly divided into three equal groups: control, IS, and Octreotide-treated stressed groups. Octreotide (40 μg/kg body weight, subcutaneously) was administrated twice daily for 8 days during the exposure to IS. Octreotide was found to reduce the IS significantly and induce elevations in the plasma level of corticosterone, liver transaminases, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) as compared with IS group. Furthermore, Octreotide administration has significantly elevated the decline in the total antioxidant capacities (TAC) and lowered the elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) levels observed with IS in the hepatic tissue. Additionally, Octreotide treatment provided protection against the histopathological changes in the stressed liver in the form of significant reduction in the mean number of degenerated hepatocytes, the area % of collagen fibers, and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) immunostaining with a significant increase in the mean number of normal hepatocytes. In conclusion, stressed rats showed disturbed liver functions and its oxidant–antioxidant status with highly expression hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which were all improved by Octreotide administration, SST analogue.

Abstract: Most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) present with proteinuria and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in the interstitium. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is important for maintaining ECM metabolism and it affects the formation and development of CKD. Autophagy has been reported to be protective against renal tubular injury, but the role of autophagy related to ECM metabolism is unclear. Rab7 is a shared molecule of endocytosis and autophagy. The aim of this study is to explore the role of autophagy in regulating MMP-2 activity and to determine whether Rab7 functions in regulating MMP-2 activity and injury in albumin-overloaded TECs. In this study, abovine serum albumin (BSA)-overload rat model was first established and collagen deposition and deficient autophagic response were observed in vivo, and stimulation with albumin nanoparticles resulted in MMP-2 overactivation and obstructed autophagic flux induced by lysosomal dysfunction in vitro. Furthermore, overactivation of MMP-2 was mediated by its related regulatory molecules such as membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) on the membrane of TECs (HK-2 cellline). After up-regulating Rab7, albumin-induced MMP-2 overactivation was attenuated, which was reversed by chloroquine (CQ; an endocytosis inhibitor). In addition, our data indicated that up-regulation of Rab7 relieved epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis in albumin-treated TECs. Taken together, our study demonstrated that autophagy regulates MMP-2 activity in a Rab7-dependent manner. Thus, Rab7 is a newly developed target for protecting TECs from albumin-induced injury.

Abstract: Summary
Heterochromatin-dependent gene silencing is central to the adaptation and survival of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites, allowing clonally variant gene expression during blood infection in humans. By assessing genome-wide heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) occupancy, we present a comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin landscapes across different Plasmodium species, strains, and life cycle stages. Common targets of epigenetic silencing include fast-evolving multi-gene families encoding surface antigens and a small set of conserved HP1-associated genes with regulatory potential. Many P. falciparum heterochromatic genes are marked in a strain-specific manner, increasing the parasite's adaptive capacity. Whereas heterochromatin is strictly maintained during mitotic proliferation of asexual blood stage parasites, substantial heterochromatin reorganization occurs in differentiating gametocytes and appears crucial for the activation of key gametocyte-specific genes and adaptation of erythrocyte remodeling machinery. Collectively, these findings provide a catalog of heterochromatic genes and reveal conserved and specialized features of epigenetic control across the genus Plasmodium.

Abstract: Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used as antihypertensive drugs. Candesartan is an ARB that has also been known for its anticancer effects but the exact molecular mechanism is remaining elusive. In this research, we showed for the first time that candesartan treatment significantly sensitized human lung adenocarcinoma cells to Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis by targeting TRAIL-DR5. TRAIL selectively kills cancer cells by binding to death receptors on the cell membrane, beyond the levels causing minimal toxicity in normal cells. However, some non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients are resistant to TRAIL treatment in clinical trials due to inactivation of the death receptors during cytoprotective autophagy. The molecular mechanisms underlying candesartan-induced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis involved the downstream of AMPK phosphorylation resulting inhibition of autophagy flux, recruitment of death receptor 5 (DR5) and activation of apoptotic caspase cascade. Candesartan treatment also inhibits the expression of anti-apoptotic protein c-FLIP. Furthermore, blocking DR5 signaling using DR5 siRNA negatively regulated the apoptotic pathway and also induced autophagy flux, demonstrating the cytoprotective role of autophagy responsible for treatment resistance. This suggests that candesartan can be used to sensitize tumors to TRAIL treatment and may represent a useful strategy for human adenocarcinoma patients to overcome TRAIL resistance. Candesartan in combination with TRAIL also could be a novel therapeutic treatment for patients presenting both conditions of hypertension and lung cancer.

Abstract: PTEN, a well-known tumor suppressor, dephosphorylates PIP3 and inhibits AKT activity. A translational variant of PTEN has been identified and termed PTEN-Long (PTEN-L). The additional 173 amino acids (PTEN-L leader) at the N-terminal constitute a potential signal peptide. Differing from canonical PTEN, PTEN-L is secreted into the extracellular fluid and re-enters recipient cells, playing the similar roles as PTEN in vivo and in vitro. This character confers the PTEN-L a therapeutic ability via directly protein delivering instead of traditional DNA and RNA vector options. In the present study, we employed PTEN-L leader to assemble a fusion protein, PTEN-L-p53, inosculated with the transcriptional regulator TP53, which is another powerful tumor suppressor. We overexpressed PTEN-L-p53 in HEK293T cells and detected it in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Subsequently, we found that PTEN-L-p53 was secreted outside of the cells and detected in the culture media by immunoblotting. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PTEN-L-p53 freely entered the cells and suppressed the viability of U251cells (p53R273H, a cell line with p53 R273H-mutation). PTEN-L-p53 is composed of endogenous protein/peptide bearing low immunogenicity, and only the junction region between PTEN-L leader and p53 can act as a new immune epitope. Accordingly, this fusion protein can potentially be used as a therapeutic option for TP53-abnormality cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils represent the most abundant immune cells recruited to inflamed tissues. A lack of dedicated tools has hampered their detection and study. We show that a synthesized peptide, MUB40, binds to lactoferrin, the most abundant protein stored in neutrophil-specific and tertiary granules. Lactoferrin is specifically produced by neutrophils among other leukocytes, making MUB40 a specific neutrophil marker. Naive mammalian neutrophils (human, guinea pig, mouse, rabbit) were labeled by fluorescent MUB40 conjugates (-Cy5, Dylight405). A peptidase-resistant retro-inverso MUB40 (RI-MUB40) was synthesized and its lactoferrin-binding property validated. Neutrophil lactoferrin secretion during in vitro Shigella infection was assessed with RI-MUB40-Cy5 using live cell microscopy. Systemically administered RI-MUB40-Cy5 accumulated at sites of inflammation in a mouse arthritis inflammation model in vivo and showed usefulness as a potential tool for inflammation detection using non-invasive imaging. Improving neutrophil detection with the universal and specific MUB40 marker will aid the study of broad ranges of inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Lung epithelial lineages have been difficult to maintain in pure form in vitro, and lineage-specific reporters have proven invaluable for monitoring their emergence from cultured pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). However, reporter constructs for tracking proximal airway lineages generated from PSCs have not been previously available, limiting the characterization of these cells. Here, we engineer mouse and human PSC lines carrying airway secretory lineage reporters that facilitate the tracking, purification, and profiling of this lung subtype. Through bulk and single-cell-based global transcriptomic profiling, we find PSC-derived airway secretory cells are susceptible to phenotypic plasticity exemplified by the tendency to co-express both a proximal airway secretory program as well as an alveolar type 2 cell program, which can be minimized by inhibiting endogenous Wnt signaling. Our results provide global profiles of engineered lung cell fates, a guide for improving their directed differentiation, and a human model of the developing airway.

Abstract: YB-1 nuclear translocation/accumulation caused by anticancer agents leads to malignant transformation. Nuclear import of YB-1 requires a nuclear localization signal (YB-NLS). Previously, we identified five nucleocytoplasmic-shuttling proteins as YB-NLS binding proteins, and showed that they co-accumulate in the nucleus with YB-1 in response to treatment with actinomycin D. In addition, another group reported that transportin-1 is the molecule responsible for YB-1 nuclear translocation, binding to a region (PY-NLS) consistent with the YB-NLS. Recently, we found that indirubin 3′-oxime inhibits the nuclear localization of YB-1 in HepG2 cells and increases their sensitivity to actinomycin D. Here, we found that YB-1 nuclear translocation is dependent on the cellular mRNA level and that indirubin 3′-oxime inhibits the interaction between YB-1 and transportin-1. Interestingly, in cells showing inhibition of actinomycin D-induced YB-1 nuclear translocation by the compound, the YB-NLS-binding proteins as well as transportin-1 and its cargos were imported to the nucleus. Furthermore, the compound inhibited nuclear localization of the GFP-conjugated full-length YB-1 but not that of GFP-conjugated YB-NLS. These results indicate that indirubin 3′-oxime is a specific inhibitor of anticancer agent-induced YB-1 nuclear translocation, interacting with YB-1 itself in a region other than the YB-NLS/PY-NLS. This compound would increase the efficacy of cancer therapy.

Ubiquitylation is one of the most versatile protein post-translational modifications and is frequently altered during virus infections. Here we employed a functional proteomics screen to identify host proteins that are differentially ubiquitylated upon dengue virus (DENV) infection. Among the several differentially modified proteins identified in infected cells was AUP1, a lipid droplet-localized type-III membrane protein, which exists predominantly in the mono-ubiquitylated form. AUP1 associated with DENV NS4A and relocalized from lipid droplets to autophagosomes upon infection. Virus production was abolished in cells deleted for AUP1 or expressing an AUP1 acyltransferase domain mutant. Ubiquitylation disrupted the AUP1-NS4A interaction, resulting in inhibited acyltransferase activity, defective lipophagy, and attenuated virus production. Our results show that DENV-NS4A exploits the acyltransferase activity of AUP1 to trigger lipophagy, a process regulated by ubiquitylation. This mechanism appears to be a general phenomenon in biogenesis of flaviviruses and underscores the critical role of post-translational modifications in virus infections.

Abstract: Summary
The large yybP-ykoY family of bacterial riboswitches is broadly distributed phylogenetically. Previously, these gene-regulatory RNAs were proposed to respond to Mn2+. X-ray crystallography revealed a binuclear cation-binding pocket. This comprises one hexacoordinate site, with six oxygen ligands, which preorganizes the second, with five oxygen and one nitrogen ligands. The relatively soft nitrogen ligand was proposed to confer affinity for Mn2+, but how this excludes other soft cations remained enigmatic. By subjecting representative yybP-ykoY riboswitches to diverse cations in vitro, we now find that these RNAs exhibit limited transition metal ion selectivity. Among the cations tested, Cd2+ and Mn2+ bind most tightly, and comparison of three new Cd2+-bound crystal structures suggests that these riboswitches achieve selectivity by enforcing heptacoordination (favored by high-spin Cd2+ and Mn2+, but otherwise uncommon) in the softer site. Remarkably, the Cd2+- and Mn2+-selective bacterial transcription factor MntR also uses heptacoordination within a binuclear site to achieve selectivity.

Abstract: Summary
The transition from naive to primed state of pluripotent stem cells is hallmarked by epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, and changes in the epigenetic landscape. Since these changes are also seen as putative hallmarks of neoplastic cell transformation, we hypothesized that oncogenic pathways may be involved in this process. We report that the activity of RAS is repressed in the naive state of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and that all three RAS isoforms are significantly activated upon early differentiation induced by LIF withdrawal, embryoid body formation, or transition to the primed state. Forced expression of active RAS and RAS inhibition have shown that RAS regulates glycolysis, CADHERIN expression, and the expression of repressive epigenetic marks in pluripotent stem cells. Altogether, this study indicates that RAS is located at a key junction of early ESC differentiation controlling key processes in priming of naive cells.

Abstract: Globally, heat stress seriously threatens productivity of cattle. The objective of this study was to identify novel miRNAs that regulated heat stress in feedlot cattle. Experiment was conducted under heat stress and normal conditions. With profiling miRNAs of each feedlot cattle, our results showed the level of miR-1246 was significantly increased in these heat-stressed cattle (P < 0.05). Furthermore, by using bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays combined with qPCR and western blot, we found miR-1246 negatively regulated poly (C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) and cAMP response element binding protein-like 2 (CREBL2) mRNA and protein levels through binding to the 3′-UTR region (P < 0.05); further, it inhibited heat-induced apoptosis in lung cells. Finally, our results suggested that miR-1246 plays an important role in heat stress and it has the potential to be a novel modulation factor for heat stress in feedlot cattle.

Abstract: Summary
Potential RNA drug targets for small molecules are found throughout the human transcriptome, yet small molecules known to elicit a pharmacological response by directly targeting RNA are limited to antibacterials. Herein, we describe AbsorbArray, a small molecule microarray-based approach that allows for unmodified compounds, including FDA-approved drugs, to be probed for binding to RNA motif libraries in a massively parallel format. Several drug classes bind RNA including kinase and topoisomerase inhibitors. The latter avidly bound the motif found in the Dicer site of oncogenic microRNA (miR)-21 and inhibited its processing both in vitro and in cells. The most potent compound de-repressed a downstream protein target and inhibited a miR-21-mediated invasive phenotype. The compound's activity was ablated upon overexpression of pre-miR-21. Target validation via chemical crosslinking and isolation by pull-down showed direct engagement of pre-miR-21 by the small molecule in cells, demonstrating that RNAs should indeed be considered druggable.

Abstract: Neuroinflammation is often associated with pathological changes in the function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) caused by disassembly of tight and adherens junctions that under physiological conditions are important for the maintenance of the BBB integrity. Consequently, in inflammation the BBB becomes dysfunctional, facilitating leukocyte traversal of the barrier and accumulation of immune cells within the brain. The extracellular matrix (ECM) also contributes to BBB integrity but the significance of the main ECM receptors, the β1 integrins also expressed on endothelial cells, is less well understood. To evaluate whether β1 integrin function is affected during inflammation and impacts barrier function, we used a transformed human brain microvascular endothelial cell (THBMEC)-based Interleukin 1β (IL-1β)-induced inflammatory in vitro BBB model. We demonstrate that IL-1β increases cell-matrix adhesion and induces a redistribution of active β1 integrins to the basal surface. In particular, binding of α5β1 integrin to its ligand fibronectin is enhanced and α5β1 integrin-dependent signalling is upregulated. Additionally, localisation of the tight junction protein claudin-5 is altered. Blockade of the α5β1 integrin reduces the IL-1β-induced transendothelial migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). These data imply that IL-1β-induced inflammation not only destabilizes tight junctions but also increases α5β1 integrin-dependent cell-matrix adhesion to fibronectin.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphoribosyltransferases catalyze the displacement of a PRPP α-1′-pyrophosphate to a nitrogen-containing nucleobase. How they control the balance of substrates/products binding and activities is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the human adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (hAPRT) that produces AMP in the purine salvage pathway. We show that a single oxygen atom from the Tyr105 side chain is responsible for selecting the active conformation of the 12 amino acid long catalytic loop. Using in vitro, cellular, and in crystallo approaches, we demonstrated that Tyr105 is key for the fine-tuning of the kinetic activity efficiencies of the forward and reverse reactions. Together, our results reveal an evolutionary pressure on the strictly conserved Tyr105 and on the dynamic motion of the flexible loop in phosphoribosyltransferases that is essential for purine biosynthesis in cells. These data also provide the framework for designing novel adenine derivatives that could modulate, through hAPRT, diseases-involved cellular pathways.

Abstract: Hypoxia causes dramatic changes in gene expression profiles, and the mechanism of hypoxia-inducible transcription has been analyzed for use as a model system of stress-inducible gene regulation. In this study, changes in chromatin organization in promoters of hypoxia-inducible genes were investigated during hypoxia-reoxygenation conditions. Most of the hypoxia-inducible gene promoters were hypersensitive to DNase I under both normal and hypoxic conditions, and our data indicate an immediate recruitment of transcription factors under hypoxic conditions. In some of the hypoxia-inducible promoters, nucleosome-free DNA regions (NFRs) were established in parallel with hypoxia-induced transcription. We also show that the hypoxia-inducible formation of NFRs requires that hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) bind to the promoters together with the transcriptional coactivator CBP. Within 1 h after the hypoxia exposure was ended (reoxygenation), HIF complexes were dissociated from the promoter regions. Within 24 h of reoxygenation, the hypoxia-induced transcription returned to basal levels and the nucleosome structure was reassembled in the hypoxia-inducible NFRs. Nucleosome reassembly required the function of the transcriptional coregulator SIN3A. Thus, reversible changes in nucleosome organization mediated by transcription factors are notable features of stress-inducible gene regulation.

Abstract: Little is known about the effects of combinatorial dietary compounds on the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms involved in breast cancer prevention. The human diet consists of a multitude of components, and there is a need to elucidate how certain compounds interact in collaboration. Withaferin A (WA), found in the Indian winter cherry and documented as a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor, and sulforaphane (SFN), a well-known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor found in cruciferous vegetables, are two epigenetic modifying compounds that have only recently been studied in conjunction. The use of DNMT and HDAC inhibitors to reverse the malignant expression of certain genes in breast cancer has shown considerable promise. Previously, we found that SFN + WA synergistically promote breast cancer cell death. Herein, we determined that these compounds inhibit cell cycle progression from S to G2 phase in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this unique combination of epigenetic modifying compounds down-regulates the levels of Cyclin D1 and CDK4, and pRB; conversely, the levels of E2F mRNA and tumor suppressor p21 are increased independently of p53. We find these events coincide with an increase in unrestricted histone methylation. We propose SFN + WA-induced breast cancer cell death is attributed, in part, to epigenetic modifications that result in the modulated expression of key genes responsible for the regulation of cancer cell senescence.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by early degeneration of cholinergic neurons and decreased levels of nerve growth factor (NGF). Thus, increasing the NGF levels by for instance encapsulated cell bio-delivery (ECB) is a potential treatment strategy. The results from our previous first-in-human studies on ECB of NGF to the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons were promising, but indicated some variability of long-term viability of the encapsulated cells and associated reduced NGF-release. Here we studied the effect of amyloid beta-peptides (Aβ), interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β), and CSF from AD, Lewy body dementia (LBD) or subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) patients on the NGF overproducing cell line NGC-0295. At physiological concentrations, neither Aβ40 nor Aβ42 had any major impact on cell viability or NGF-production. In contrast, IL-1β dose-dependently affected NGF-production over time. Exposure of NGF-producing cells to CSF from AD patients showed significantly reduced NGF-release as compared to CSF from LBD or SCI patients. By mass spectrometry we found 3 proteins involved in inflammatory pathways to have an altered expression in AD CSF compared to LBD and SCI. Cell survival and NGF-release were not affected by Aβ. NGF-release was affected by IL-1β, suggesting that inflammation has a negative effect on ECB cells.

Abstract: Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a special type of vascular channel formed by tumor cells without endothelial cell participation. Migration-inducing gene 7 (MIG-7) plays an important role in regulating VM. In this study, immunohistochemical staining was used to detect MIG-7 in tissue specimens from 141 primary osteosarcoma patients, and the relationship between MIG-7 and VM was examined. Survival analysis were performed to evaluate the prognoses. MIG-7 knockdown osteosarcoma cells were used for cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasiveness and VM formation assays. A spontaneously metastasizing cell line-derived orthotopic xenograft mouse model was established to evaluate the effect of MIG-7 knockdown on tumorigenesis, VM formation and lung metastasis. MIG-7 expression was associated with VM formation. There were significant differences in overall and metastasis-free survival between the MIG-7-positive and MIG-7-negative groups. The MIG-7 expression was shown to be an independent indicator of both overall and metastasis-free survival. In vitro knockdown of MIG-7 dramatically reduced migration, invasion and VM formation in osteosarcoma cells without any significant effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis. MIG-7 knockdown also exhibited potent antitumor, antimetastasis and anti-VM effects in the orthotopic mouse model of 143B osteosarcoma. Therefore, MIG-7 serves as an independent unfavorable prognostic indicator in osteosarcoma patients and MIG-7 is an important mediator of osteosarcoma VM formation.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac hypertrophy accompanies many forms of cardiovascular diseases. The mechanisms behind the development and regulation of cardiac hypertrophy in the human setting are poorly understood, which can be partially attributed to the lack of a human cardiomyocyte-based preclinical test system recapitulating features of diseased myocardium. The objective of our study is to determine whether human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) subjected to mechanical stretch can be used as an adequate in vitro model for studying molecular mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy. We show that hESC-CMs subjected to cyclic stretch, which mimics mechanical overload, exhibit essential features of a hypertrophic state on structural, functional, and gene expression levels. The presented hESC-CM stretch approach provides insight into molecular mechanisms behind mechanotransduction and cardiac hypertrophy and lays groundwork for the development of pharmacological approaches as well as for discovering potential circulating biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Deciphering the mechanisms that regulate the quiescence of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies based on the stimulation of their endogenous regenerative potential in the damaged brain. We show that LeXbright cells sorted from the adult mouse subventricular zone exhibit all the characteristic features of quiescent NSCs. Indeed, they constitute a subpopulation of slowly dividing cells that is able to enter the cell cycle to regenerate the irradiated niche. Comparative transcriptomic analyses showed that they express hallmarks of NSCs but display a distinct molecular signature from activated NSCs (LeX+EGFR+ cells). Particularly, numerous membrane receptors are expressed on quiescent NSCs. We further revealed a different expression pattern of Syndecan-1 between quiescent and activated NSCs and demonstrated its role in the proliferation of activated NSCs. Our data highlight the central role of the stem cell microenvironment in the regulation of quiescence in adult neurogenic niches.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a male-dominant cancer. Several factors may contribute to the gender difference. Recent investigations have reported that miRNAs are involved in sex-linked signaling pathways and play a critical role in the molecular pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC. Therefore, we speculated that some of these miRNAs might contribute to the gender differences observed in HBV-related HCC. Our results showed that miR-371a-5p was significantly upregulated in tumor tissue and serum from HCC patients and that the expression level of miR-371a-5p was related to HBV infection, sexuality, TNM stage, adjacent organ invasion and microvascular invasion. Moreover, a high level of miR-371a-5p expression predicted poor overall survival of HCC patients, and in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that the overexpression of miR-371a-5p promoted proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistic investigations suggested that miR-371a-5p was upregulated by HBV and testosterone through LEF-1. SRCIN1 was a direct target of miR-371a-5p and reversed the effects of miR-371a-5p on HCC tumorigenesis. Our results also revealed that SRCIN1 negatively regulated the expression of PTN by inhibiting the activity of NF-κB. As a hepatocyte growth factor, PTN promoted EMT-induced metastasis in vitro and in vivo through the AKT/Slug pathway. These data strongly suggested that the upregulation of miR-371a-5p played an important role in HBV-related HCC. Through the LEF-1/miR-371a-5p/SRCIN1/PTN/Slug pathway, HBV and testosterone promote the proliferation and metastasis of hepatoma cells, especially in male patients with HBV-related HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Fulfilling the potential of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes for studying conduction and arrhythmogenesis requires development of multicellular models and methods for long-term repeated tissue phenotyping. We generated confluent hiPSC-derived cardiac cell sheets (hiPSC-CCSs), expressing the genetically encoded voltage indicator ArcLight. ArcLight-based optical mapping allowed generation of activation and action-potential duration (APD) maps, which were validated by mapping the same hiPSC-CCSs with the voltage-sensitive dye, Di-4-ANBDQBS. ArcLight mapping allowed long-term assessment of electrical remodeling in the hiPSC-CCSs and evaluation of drug-induced conduction slowing (carbenoxolone, lidocaine, and quinidine) and APD prolongation (quinidine and dofetilide). The latter studies also enabled step-by-step depiction of drug-induced arrhythmogenesis ("torsades de pointes in the culture dish") and its prevention by MgSO4 and rapid pacing. Phase-mapping analysis allowed biophysical characterization of spiral waves induced in the hiPSC-CCSs and their termination by electrical cardioversion and overdrive pacing. In conclusion, ArcLight mapping of hiPSC-CCSs provides a powerful tool for drug testing and arrhythmia investigation.

Abstract: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage renal failure in the western world. Current treatment of diabetic kidney disease relies on nutritional management and drug therapies to achieve metabolic control. Here, we discuss the potential application of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), a treatment which requires patients to breathe in 100% oxygen at elevated ambient pressures. HBOT has traditionally been used to diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) refractory to conventional medical treatments. Successful clinic responses seen in the DFU provide the underlying therapeutic rationale for testing HBOT in the setting of DKD. Both the DFU and DKD have microvascular endothelial disease as a common underlying pathologic feature. Supporting evidence for HBOT of DKD comes from previous animal studies and from our preliminary prospective clinical trial reported here. We report urinary metabolomic data obtained from patients undergoing HBOT for DFU, before and after exposure to 6 weeks of HBOT. The preliminary data support the concept that HBOT can reduce biomarkers of renal injury, oxidant stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in patients receiving HBOT for DFU. Further studies are needed to confirm these initial findings and correlate them with simultaneous measures of renal function. HBOT is a safe and effective treatment for DFU and could also be for individuals with DKD.

Abstract: Neurons are highly polarized cells with an axon and dendritic arbors. It is still not well studied that how formation and elaboration of axon and dendrites is controlled by diffusible signaling factors such as glutamate via specific receptors. We found that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors were enriched (stage 2–3) but decreased expression (stage 4–5) at tip of axon of cultured hippocampal neurons during distinct development stages. Inhibition of NMDA receptor activity by competitive antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) or channel blocker MK801 promoted axonal outgrowth at the early stages, whereas inhibited dendritic development in later stages. Meanwhile, knockdown of NMDA receptors also promoted axonal outgrowth and branch in immature neurons. Furthermore, GluN2B but not GluN2A subunit inhibited axonal outgrowth in immature hippocampal neurons. Finally, we found that NMDA receptors inhibited axonal outgrowth by inactivating Akt and activating GSK-3β signaling in a calcineurin-dependent manner.

Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a lethal cancer associated with chronic inflammation that has increased in prevalence in recent decades. The dysregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been detected in various types of malignancies, and depending on the target genes this can result in miRNAs functioning as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-124 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and found that its expression was significantly downregulated in the tumor tissue of patients and in CCA cell lines. Our results provided evidence that miR-124 induces apoptotic cell death and triggers the autophagic flux in CCA cells. EZH2 and STAT3 were identified as direct targets of miR-124. The effect of miR-124 on EZH2 expression in CCA cells was evaluated using cell transfection, xenotransplantation into nude mice and a luciferase reporter assay. Silencing of EZH2 restored the effects of miR-124, whereas overexpression of EZH2 abrogated the effects of miR-124. Silencing of Beclin1 or ATG5 abrogated the effects of miR-124 or siEZH2. In vivo, overexpression of miR-124 dramatically induced autophagy-related cell death and suppressed tumorigenicity. Taken together, our findings indicated that downregulation of miR-124 expression was associated with disease progression in human CCA and we revealed that miR-124 exerts a tumor suppressive function in CCA by inducing autophagy-related cell death via direct targeting of the EZH2–STAT3 signaling axis.

Abstract: The miR-200 family of microRNAs consisting of miR-141, miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c and miR-429 are emerging as important regulators of breast cancer progression. This family of microRNAs maintain mammary epithelial identity and downregulation of miR-200 expression has been associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mammary tumors. Therefore, re-expression of one or more miR-200 family members in mammary tumor cells with mesenchymal characteristics may restore an epithelial phenotype including growth and metastasis suppression. To test this hypothesis, the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster was re-expressed in a murine claudin-low cell line, RJ423. Re-expression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster in RJ423 cells significantly suppressed the expression of Vim, Snai1, Twist1, Twist2 and Zeb1, reverted RJ423 cells to a more epithelial morphology and significantly inhibited proliferation in vitro. Moreover, the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster prevented lung metastasis in an experimental metastasis model and although tumor initiation was not prevented, re-expression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster induced a dormancy-like state where mammary tumors failed to grow beyond ~150 mm3 or grew extremely slowly following intra-mammary injection. These dormant tumors contained elevated levels of collagen and were highly vascularized. Therefore, re-expression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster in the claudin-low mammary tumor cell line, RJ423, is sufficient to alter cell morphology, impair metastasis and induce tumor dormancy.

Abstract: Rap1b was found be dysregulated in several types of cancers. Previously, we have demonstrated that Rap1b affects proliferation, migration and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, the definite function of Rap1b in HCC remains unknown. Here, we reported that Rap1b was significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues compared with the non-tumoral liver tissues. Overexpression of Rap1b promoted tumor growth and migration in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Oppositely, inhibition of Rap1b suppressed the proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Mechanism study revealed that Rap1b could up-regulate Twist 1 expression by enhancing its promoter activity. We concluded that Rap1b increased Twist 1 expression by targeting its promoter activity to induce proliferation and migration of HCC cells.

Abstract: ER-localized proteins have been reported function in endoplasmic reticulum, unfolded protein degradation and destruction of misfolded proteins by the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system, but their function in the chemotaxis of macrophage cells remained un-addressed. Here, we showed that ER protein with ubiquitin like domain 1(Herpud1) was upregulated in IL-4-treated M2 macrophage cells and its expression pattern was similar with macrophage polarization markers, such as Arg1, Mrc1 and Fizz1. Inhibition of Herpud1 by using specific target shRNA decreased these marker's expression at mRNA and protein level in IL-4-treated or -untreated M2 macrophage cells. IL-4 treatment promoted M2 macrophage cell migration and polarization, but this promotion was weakened by Herpud1 depletion and we got similar results by inhibition of ER stress response with chemical molecule 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) in IL-4-treated or untreated-M2 macrophage cells with Herpud1 overexpression. These results indicated that depending on ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) to help unfolded protein degradation or destruction is not the only function of Herpud1 and acting as a mediator of IL-4 induced macrophage activation and polarization maybe another unrevealed function, elucidating the role of Herpud1-associated M2 macrophage cell polarization and activation are helpful for exploration the function of macrophage cells in immune response.

Abstract: ADAM17 is believed to promote tumor development by facilitating both cell proliferation and migration. In this study, we investigated the involvement of ADAM17 and the activation of the integrin pathway in the regulation of the malignant properties of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and tissues. ADAM17 was positively correlated with active integrin β1, which was determined using a human tissue microarray and an N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced HCC mouse model. We found elevated ADAM17 and active integrin β1 levels in HCC tissues compared with adjacent liver tissues, and the active integrin β1 levels were associated with tumor size and TNM grade. High ADAM17 and active integrin β1 levels in tumor tissues were significantly associated with poor survival of HCC patients. RNAi-mediated ADAM17 knockdown and integrin β1 blockade significantly attenuated the migration and invasion of HCC cells, and overexpression of ADAM17 showed the reverse effects. ADAM17 interference attenuated the intrahepatic growth and metastasis of HCC cells in an orthotopic xenograft model. ADAM17-knockdown cells showed diminished levels of active integrin β1, p-FAK, p-AKT, MMP-2 and MMP-9. ADAM17 knockdown significantly attenuated the translocation of the Notch1 intracellular domain into the nucleus, whereas overexpression of the Notch1 intracellular domain rescued the translocation and enhanced the activation of integrin β1. Our data provide evidence for ADAM17 as an important determinant of malignant properties via regulation of integrin β1 activation and Notch1 signaling. Inhibition of ADAM17 may provide viable therapeutic potential for preventing HCC metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is initiated by the attachment of the viral glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) to sialic acid on the host cell surface. However, the sialic acid-containing receptor crucial for IAV infection has remained unidentified. Here, we show that HA binds to the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel Cav1.2 to trigger intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and subsequent IAV entry and replication. IAV entry was inhibited by Ca2+ channel blockers (CCBs) or by knockdown of Cav1.2. The CCB diltiazem also inhibited virus replication in vivo. Reintroduction of wild-type but not the glycosylation-deficient mutants of Cav1.2 restored Ca2+ oscillations and virus infection in Cav1.2-depleted cells, demonstrating the significance of Cav1.2 sialylation. Taken together, we identify Cav1.2 as a sialylated host cell surface receptor that binds HA and is critical for IAV entry.

Abstract: Identification of transcription factors expressed by differentiated cells is informative not only of tissue-specific pathways, but to help identify master regulators for cellular reprogramming. If applied, such an approach could generate healthy autologous tissue-specific cells for clinical use where cells from the homologous tissue are unavailable due to disease. Normal human epithelial cells of buccal and urothelial derivation maintained in identical culture conditions that lacked significant instructive or permissive signaling cues were found to display inherent similarities and differences of phenotype. Investigation of transcription factors implicated in driving urothelial-type differentiation revealed buccal epithelial cells to have minimal or absent expression of PPARG, GATA3 and FOXA1 genes. Retroviral overexpression of protein coding sequences for GATA3 or PPARy1 in buccal epithelial cells resulted in nuclear immunolocalisation of the respective proteins, with both transductions also inducing expression of the urothelial differentiation-associated claudin 3 tight junction protein. PPARG1 overexpression alone entrained expression of nuclear FOXA1 and GATA3 proteins, providing objective evidence of its upstream positioning in a transcription factor network and identifying it as a candidate factor for urothelial-type transdifferentiation or reprogramming.

Abstract: The third subunit of the COP9 signalosome (COPS3) is associated with cell proliferation and tumorigenesis process in cancer. The present study showed that the expression level of COPS3 was upregulated in malignant cell lines and COPS3 overexpression was related with clinical stage, T stage, historical grade. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that COPS3 may function as a prognostic factor for overall survival. CCK-8 and colony formation assays revealed that knockdown of COPS3 in ACHN and 786-O significantly impacted proliferation in vitro. In addition, flow cytometry showed that inhibition of COPS3 induced G0/G1 arrest and promoted apoptosis. COPS3 may promote kidney cancer progression by altering Phospho-AKT(Thr308), Cyclin D1 and Caspase-3 expression. Collectively, Our findings suggest that COPS3 may be a new potential target of ccRCC.

Abstract: Gelsolin is an actin binding protein present in blood plasma and in cytoplasm of cells including macrophages. Gelsolin has important functions in cell cycle regulation, apoptotic regulation, and morphogenesis. Even though bone marrow macrophages and serum factors are critical for regulating erythropoiesis, the role of gelsolin on human erythroblasts has not been studied. Here, we investigated the effects of human recombinant plasma gelsolin (pGSN) on human immature erythroblasts. CD34+ cells isolated from cord blood were differentiated into erythroid cells in serum-free medium. When pGSN was applied to the culture medium, it accelerated basophilic and polychromatic erythroblast maturation and increased the enucleation rate with highly expressed erythropoiesis-related mRNAs. Also, pGSN was effective in reducing dysplastic changes caused by vincristine, suggesting its role in cell cycle progression at G2/M checkpoints. Also, pGSN activated caspase-3 during maturation stages in which caspase-3 functions as a non-apoptotic maturational signal or a pro-apoptotic signal depending on maturation stages. Our results suggest that pGSN has a pivotal role in maturation of erythroblasts and this factor might be one of the way how bone marrow macrophages and previously unknown serum factors work to control erythropoiesis. pGSN might be used as additive for in vitro production of erythrocytes.

Abstract: During development, multipotent progenitors undergo temporally-restricted differentiation into post-mitotic retinal cells; however, the mechanisms of progenitor division that occurs during retinogenesis remain controversial. Using clonal analyses (lineage tracing and single cell cultures), we identify rod versus cone lineage-specific progenitors derived from both adult retinal stem cells and embryonic neural retinal precursors. Taurine and retinoic acid are shown to act in an instructive and lineage-restricted manner early in the progenitor lineage hierarchy to produce rod-restricted progenitors from stem cell progeny. We also identify an instructive, but lineage-independent, mechanism for the specification of cone-restricted progenitors through the suppression of multiple differentiation signaling pathways. These data indicate that exogenous signals play critical roles in directing lineage decisions and resulting in fate-restricted rod or cone photoreceptor progenitors in culture. Additional factors may be involved in governing photoreceptor fates in vivo.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate whether treatment-damaged hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) would accelerate liver cirrhosis through promoting the activities of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). HCC cells were exposed to chemotherapeutic agent or hypoxia to mimic the transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)-like treatment. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) expression was increased in cisplatin- or hypoxia-treated HCC cells. Treatment-induced GDF15 increase in HCC cells was mediated by p38MAPK, JNK, ERK1/2 activation. GDF15 from treatment-damaged HCC cells enhanced the proliferation and collagen synthesis of HSCs through ERK1/2- and Smad3-dependent pathways. Metformin significantly reduced the GDF15 production from treatment-damaged HCC cells by targeting JNK. The use of metformin could attenuate the in vivo fibrotic activities of HSCs promoted by treatment-damaged HCC cells and inhibit GDF15 expression. In conclusion, treatment-damaged HCC accelerates fibrosis by promoting the activities of HSCs via GDF15 secretion, which could be reversed by metformin. This provides a potential therapeutic target for alleviating TACE-aggravated liver cirrhosis.

Abstract: Making sure the change of nuclear LC3 distribution in the autophagy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell and finding out the regulation mechanism may lead to a breakthrough for killing AML cells. Western blots were performed to assess the expression of autophagy proteins. Changes in the LC3 distribution were monitored by immunofluorescence assays together with western blots, and the expression levels of Sirt1, DOR, Beclin1, HMGB1, and AMPK mRNA were detected via fluorescent quantitative PCR. The effects of Sirt1 and DOR on cell proliferation and survival were analyzed by MTT, flow cytometry, and western blotting assays. We found that treating AML cells with Ara-c or Sorafenib resulted in autophagy enhancement, and when autophagy was enhanced, nuclear LC3 moved into the cytoplasm. Notably, when autophagy was inhibited by blocking the nuclear LC3 shift, the cytotoxicity of drugs was enhanced. Our results also identified Sirt1 and DOR as regulatory molecules for the observed nuclear LC3 shift, and these molecules further affected the expression of Beclin1, HMGB1, and AMPK. Our results suggest the distribution of nuclear LC3 can be a novel way for further studying death of AML cells,and the regulatory molecules may be new targets for treating AML

Abstract: Interest in human brown fat as a novel therapeutic target to tackle the growing obesity and diabetes epidemic has increased dramatically in recent years. While much insight into brown fat biology has been gained from murine cell lines and models, few resources are available to study human brown fat in vitro, which makes the need for new ways to derive and study human brown adipocytes imperative. Human ES cell based reporter systems present an excellent tool to identify, mark, and purify cell populations of choice. In this study, we detail the derivation and characterization of a novel human ES UCP1 reporter cell line that marks UCP1 positive adipocytes in vitro. We targeted a mCherry reporter to the UCP1 stop codon via CRISPR-Cas9 based gene targeting. The brown adipocytes derived from reporter cells express UCP1, display high mitochondrial content, multi-locular lipid morphology, and exhibit functional properties such as lipolysis. The mCherry positive cells purified after cell sorting show elevated expression of brown fat marker genes and a high similarity to isolated human brown fat via RNA-seq analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this reporter to real time monitor UCP1 expression upon stimulation. This reporter cell line thus presents new opportunities to study human brown fat biology by enabling future work to understand early human brown fat development, perform disease modeling, and facilitate drug screening.

Abstract: Summary
MSI2, which is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), enforces HSPC expansion when overexpressed and is upregulated in myeloid leukemias, indicating its regulated transcription is critical to balanced self-renewal and leukemia restraint. Despite this, little is understood of the factors that enforce appropriate physiological levels of MSI2 in the blood system. Here, we define a promoter region that reports on endogenous expression of MSI2 and identify USF2 and PLAG1 as transcription factors whose promoter binding drives reporter activity. We show that these factors co-regulate, and are required for, efficient transactivation of endogenous MSI2. Coincident overexpression of USF2 and PLAG1 in primitive cord blood cells enhanced MSI2 transcription and yielded cellular phenotypes, including expansion of CD34+ cells in vitro, consistent with that achieved by direct MSI2 overexpression. Global chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses confirm a preferential co-binding of PLAG1 and USF2 at the promoter of MSI2, as well as regulatory regions corresponding to genes with roles in HSPC homeostasis. PLAG1 and USF2 cooperation is thus an important contributor to stem cell-specific expression of MSI2 and HSPC-specific transcriptional circuitry.

Abstract: Neural precursor cells (NPCs) respond to externally applied direct current electrical fields (DCEFs) by undergoing rapid and directed migration toward the cathode in a process known as galvanotaxis. It is unknown if the underlying mechanisms of galvanotactic migration is common to non-electrosensitive cells and if so, how NPCs and other galvanotactic cells sense and transduce electrical fields into cellular motility. In this study, we show that distinct aspects of NPC galvanotactic migration: motility (quantified through |velocity|) and directedness, are differentially regulated by calcium. We use low-Ca2+ culture conditions; an intracellular Ca2+ chelator; and voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) inhibitors to specific channels expressed on NPCs, to demonstrate the role of Ca2+ influx in DCEF-induced NPC migration. Consistent with existing literature, we show Ca2+ is involved in F-actin polymerization that lengthens NPC membrane protrusions necessary for cellular motility. However, inhibiting Ca2+ results in reduced velocity but has no effect on DCEF-induced directedness. This dissociation between velocity and directedness reveal that these migration parameters can be independently regulated, thus suggesting a parallel process of sensing DCEFs by NPCs.

Abstract: MicroRNA (miR) is important regulators of gene expression, and aberrant miR expression has been linked to oncogenesis; however, little is understood about their contribution to colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we determined that miR-23a is overexpressed in human colorectal cancer cell lines and tissues compared with that of normal cells. The stable over-expression of miR-23a in CRC cells was sufficient to promote cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Further studies showed that miR-23a can directly bind to the 3′untranslated region (3′UTR) of PDK4 mRNA and subsequently repress both the mRNA and protein expressions of PDK4. PDK4 negatively regulate CRC proliferation via suppressing PDH activity. Ectopic expression of PDK4 by transiently transfected with PDK4 vector encoding the entire coding sequence could reverse the effects of miR-23a on CRC proliferation. By this way, miR-23a promotes PDH activation and oxidative phosphorylation to generate sufficient ATP for cell proliferation. Our results illustrated that the up-regulation of miR-23a played an important role in CRC cell proliferation through direct repressing PDK4, suggesting a potential application of miR-23a in prognosis prediction and therapeutic application in CRC.

Abstract: Understanding mechanisms in lineage differentiation is critical for organ development, pathophysiology and oncogenesis. To determine whether microRNAs (miRNA) may serve as drivers or adjuncts in hepatic differentiation, we studied human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocytes and primary hepatocytes representing fetal or adult stages. Model systems were used for hepatic lineage advancement or regression under culture conditions with molecular assays. Profiles of miRNA in primary fetal and adult hepatocytes shared similarities and distinctions from pluripotent stem cells or stem cell-derived early fetal-like hepatocytes. During phenotypic regression in fetal or adult hepatocytes, miRNA profiles oscillated to regain stemness-associated features that had not been extinguished in stem cell-derived fetal-like hepatocytes. These oscillations in stemness-associated features were not altered in fetal-like hepatocytes by inhibitory mimics for dominantly-expressed miRNA, such as hsa-miR-99b, -100, -214 and -221/222. The stem cell-derived fetal-like hepatocytes were permissive for miRNA characterizing mature hepatocytes, including mimics for hsa-miR-122, -126, -192, -194 and -26b, although transfections of the latter did not advance hepatic differentiation. Examination of genome-wide mRNA expression profiles in stem cell-derived or primary fetal hepatocytes indicated targets of highly abundant miRNA regulated general processes, e.g., cell survival, growth and proliferation, functional maintenance, etc., without directing cell differentiation. Among upstream regulators of gene networks in stem cell-derived hepatocytes included HNF4A, SNAI1, and others, which affect transcriptional circuits directing lineage development or maintenance. Therefore, miRNA expression oscillated in response to microenvironmental conditions, whereas lineage-specific transcriptional regulators, such as HNF4A, were necessary for directing hepatic differentiation. This knowledge will be helpful for understanding the contribution of stem cells in pathophysiological states and oncogenesis, as well as for applications of stem cell-derived hepatocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteriophage-encoded genetic elements control bacterial biological functions. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) strains harbor lambda-phages encoding the Shiga-toxin (Stx), which is expressed during the phage lytic cycle and associated with exacerbated disease. Phages also reside dormant within bacterial chromosomes through their lysogenic cycle, but how this impacts EHEC virulence remains unknown. We find that during lysogeny the phage transcription factor Cro activates the EHEC type III secretion system (T3SS). EHEC lambdoid phages are lysogenic under anaerobic conditions when Cro binds to and activates the promoters of T3SS genes. Interestingly, the Cro sequence varies among phages carried by different EHEC outbreak strains, and these changes affect Cro-dependent T3SS regulation. Additionally, infecting mice with the related pathogen C. rodentium harboring the bacteriophage cro from EHEC results in greater T3SS gene expression and enhanced virulence. Collectively, these findings reveal the role of phages in impacting EHEC virulence and their potential to affect outbreak strains.

Abstract: Summary
The naive embryonic stem cells (nESCs) display unique characteristics compared with the primed counterparts, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here we investigate the functional roles of Lncenc1, a highly abundant long noncoding RNA in nESCs. Knockdown or knockout of Lncenc1 in mouse nESCs leads to a significantly decreased expression of core pluripotency genes and a significant reduction of colony formation capability. Furthermore, upon the depletion of Lncenc1, the expression of glycolysis-associated genes is significantly reduced, and the glycolytic activity is substantially impaired, as indicated by a more than 50% reduction in levels of glucose consumption, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rate. Mechanistically, Lncenc1 interacts with PTBP1 and HNRNPK, which regulate the transcription of glycolytic genes, thereby maintaining the self-renewal of nESCs. Our results demonstrate the functions of Lncenc1 in linking energy metabolism and naive state of ESCs, which may enhance our understanding of the molecular basis underlying naive pluripotency.
