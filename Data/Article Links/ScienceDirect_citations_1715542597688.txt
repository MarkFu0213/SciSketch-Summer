Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases with spontaneous recurrent seizures. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial modulators in numerous diseases, including epilepsy. However, the functional role and potential mechanism of lncRNA Nespas in epilepsy remain unknown. Our study clarified that Nespas was underexpressed in epileptiform hippocampal tissues and neurons. Furthermore, Nespas promoted hippocampal neuron viability and proliferation, and inhibited hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Mechanistically, Nespas interacted with microRNA 615–3p (miR-615–3p) in epileptiform hippocampal neurons. 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 11 (Psmd11) was a downstream target of miR-615–3p, and Nespas elevated Psmd11 expression via competitively binding to miR-615–3p in epileptiform hippocampal neurons. In addition, rescue assays suggested that Nespas promoted hippocampal neuron viability and proliferation, and suppressed hippocampal neuron apoptosis by upregulation of Psmd11. Furthermore, Nespas suppressed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway via upregulating Psmd11 in epileptiform hippocampal neurons. This report explored the function and regulatory mechanism of Nespas in epileptiform hippocampal neurons for the first time. Our findings revealed that Nespas suppressed the apoptosis of epileptiform hippocampal neurons by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway via upregulation of Psmd11 at a miR-615–3p dependent way, indicating that Nespas may offer a new direction for the treatment of epilepsy.

Abstract: Melanoma is the most aggressive malignant tumor of skin cancer as it can grow rapidly and metastasize. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising cancer ablation method for skin tumors, although it lacks efficiency owing to factors such as tumor characteristics, delivery of photosensitizers, immune response in vivo etc. Extensive investigation of molecules that can potentially modulate treatment efficacy is required. Protein 4.1R is a cytoskeletal protein molecule. Previous studies have shown that protein 4.1R knockdown reduces PDT sensitivity in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. However, the functional role of protein 4.1R in melanoma is unclear. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the effect of protein 4.1R on PDT for melanoma in mice and the mechanism of anti-tumor immunity. Our results indicated that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated protein 4.1R knockout promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of B16 cells. We further investigated the potential mechanism of protein 4.1R on tumor cell PDT sensitivity. Our results showed that protein 4.1R knockout reduced the expression of membrane transporters γ-aminobutyric acid transporter (GAT)-1 and (GAT)-2 in B16 cells, which affected 5-ALA transmembrane transport and reduced the efficiency of PDT on B16 cells. Protein 4.1R knockout downregulated the anti-tumor immune response triggered by PDT in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggest that protein 4.1R is an important regulator in PDT for tumors and may promote the progress and efficacy of melanoma treatment.

Abstract: Previous work with cultured cells has shown transcription of muscle genes by serum response factor (SRF) can be stimulated by actin polymerization driven by proteins of the formin family. However, it is not clear if endogenous formins similarly promote SRF-dependent transcription during muscle development in vivo. We tested whether formin activity promotes SRF-dependent transcription in striated muscle in the simple animal model, Caenorhabditis elegans. Our lab has shown FHOD-1 is the only formin that directly promotes sarcomere formation in the worm's striated muscle. We show here FHOD-1 and SRF homolog UNC-120 both support muscle growth and also muscle myosin II heavy chain A expression. However, while a hypomorphic unc-120 allele blunts expression of a set of striated muscle genes, these genes are largely upregulated or unchanged by absence of FHOD-1. Instead, pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome restores myosin protein levels in worms lacking FHOD-1, suggesting elevated proteolysis accounts for their myosin deficit. Interestingly, proteasome inhibition does not restore normal muscle growth to fhod-1(Δ) mutants, suggesting formin contributes to muscle growth by some alternative mechanism. Overall, we find SRF does not depend on formin to promote muscle gene transcription in a simple in vivo system.

Abstract: Increasing effort has been put into finding novel molecular pathways to improve the efficiency of EGFR inhibitors against head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). In this study, we performed data mining and bioinformatically analysed RNA-Seq data downloaded from TCGA and confirmed that higher expression of HPRT in HNSCC tissue was related to poor prognosis of patients. Then, we conducted in vitro and in vivo loss- and gain-of-function experiments to demonstrate the role of HPRT in HNSCC cell lines. Overexpression of HPRT increased the gene expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition markers via direct interaction with STAT3. Knocking down HPRT significantly decreased tumour growth and enhanced the anticancer effect of EGFR inhibitors against HNSCC xenografts. In conclusion, HPRT is a binding partner of STAT3 that promotes EMT and proliferation. Our findings support HPRT as a promising prognostic indicator and potential therapeutic target for HNSCC.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbiota metabolites may be important for host health, yet few studies investigate the correlation between human gut microbiome and production of fecal metabolites and their impact on the plasma metabolome. Since gut microbiota metabolites are influenced by diet, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the impact of three divergent diets, vegan, omnivore, and a synthetic enteral nutrition (EEN) diet lacking fiber, on the human gut microbiome and its metabolome, including after a microbiota depletion intervention. Omnivore and vegan, but not EEN, diets altered fecal amino acid levels by supporting the growth of Firmicutes capable of amino acid metabolism. This correlated with relative abundance of a sizable number of fecal amino acid metabolites, some not previously associated with the gut microbiota. The effect on the plasma metabolome, in contrast, were modest. The impact of diet, particularly fiber, on the human microbiome influences broad classes of metabolites that may modify health.

Abstract: Summary
Designing effective carrier-selective contact is a prerequisite for high-efficiency crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells. Compared to doped silicon thin films, wide-band-gap transition metal oxides (TMOs) feature low parasitic absorption, but their carrier selectivity and passivation being poor leads to a mediocre cell efficiency. Herein, we introduce a NiOx/MoOx bilayer as an efficient hole-selective contact in c-Si solar cells. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.31% is achieved using NiOx/MoOx bilayer, outperforming cells with a single layer of NiOx or MoOx. Upon depositing NiOx on MoOx, interfacial reactions modify the stoichiometry and defect chemistry in both oxides, leading to a band alignment beneficial for hole selectivity. By inserting a SiOx tunneling layer on c-Si surface to further suppress recombination, we achieve a PCE of 21.60% (fill factor 83.34%). Our work highlights a promising approach to improve the performance of dopant-free c-Si solar cells by employing cost-effective TMOs as hole-selective contact.

Abstract: Summary
MYC is a major oncogenic transcriptional driver of most human cancers that has remained intractable to direct targeting because much of MYC is intrinsically disordered. Here, we have performed a cysteine-reactive covalent ligand screen to identify compounds that could disrupt the binding of MYC to its DNA consensus sequence in vitro and also impair MYC transcriptional activity in situ in cells. We have identified a covalent ligand, EN4, that targets cysteine 171 of MYC within a predicted intrinsically disordered region of the protein. We show that EN4 directly targets MYC in cells, reduces MYC and MAX thermal stability, inhibits MYC transcriptional activity, downregulates multiple MYC transcriptional targets, and impairs tumorigenesis. We also show initial structure-activity relationships of EN4 and identify compounds that show improved potency. Overall, we identify a unique ligandable site within an intrinsically disordered region of MYC that leads to inhibition of MYC transcriptional activity.

Abstract: Summary
Core structures with linear, planar, and spiral conformations have been designed as triphenylamine (TPA)-based hole-transporting materials (HTMs), which are the most prevalent small molecular HTMs in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, most of the reported TPA-based HTMs cannot achieve sufficient balance between efficiency and stability, which is governed by core structures. Herein, a sym-penta(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline)corannulene (cor-OMePTPA) featuring a corannulene core and five TPA peripheral arms is designed as alternative HTM. Planar negative-intrinsic-positive (n-i-p) PSCs with cor-OMePTPA exhibit champion efficiencies of 20% and maintain 86% of their initial performances for more than 1,000 h after thermal annealing at 60°C. Compared with spiro-OMeTAD, cor-OMePTPA-based PSCs show slightly lower efficiencies but much better thermal stabilities. The main merit of cor-OMePTPA lies in its bimolecular interpenetration capability with noncovalent interactions to modulate the HTM configurations from single-molecular curvature to bimolecular planarity, thereby providing promising opportunities to achieve excellent balance between efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Summary
While progress in thermoelectric materials based on the engineering of electronic and phononic characteristics is reaching a plateau, the addition of the spin degree of freedom has the potential to open a new landscape for alternative thermoelectric materials. Here, we present the concepts, current understanding, and guidelines for designing spin-driven thermoelectrics. We show that the interplay between the spin and heat currents in entropy transport via charge carriers can offer a path to enhance the electronic thermopower. The classical antiferromagnetic semiconductor manganese telluride (MnTe) is chosen as the case study due to its significant spin-mediated thermoelectric properties. We show that, although the spin-disorder scattering reduces the carrier mobility in magnetic materials, spin entropy, magnon, and paramagnon carrier drags can dominate and significantly enhance the thermoelectric power factor, and hence zT. Finally, several guidelines are drawn based on the current understanding for designing high-performance spin-driven thermoelectric materials.

Abstract: Summary
Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are master transcriptional regulators of the mevalonate pathway and lipid metabolism and represent an attractive therapeutic target for lipid metabolic disorders. SREBPs are maintained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a tripartite complex with SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and insulin-induced gene protein (INSIG). When new lipid synthesis is required, the SCAP-SREBP complex dissociates from INSIG and undergoes ER-to-Golgi transport where the N-terminal transcription factor domain is released by proteolysis. The mature transcription factor translocates to the nucleus and stimulates expression of the SREBP gene program. Previous studies showed that dipyridamole, a clinically prescribed phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, potentiated statin-induced tumor growth inhibition. Dipyridamole limited nuclear accumulation of SREBP, but the mechanism was not well resolved. In this study, we show that dipyridamole selectively blocks ER-to-Golgi movement of the SCAP-SREBP complex and that this is independent of its PDE inhibitory activity.

Abstract: Summary
BCG vaccination can strengthen protection against pathogens through the induction of epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells, a process called trained immunity. We and others recently demonstrated that mucosal or intravenous BCG better protects rhesus macaques from Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and TB disease than standard intradermal vaccination, correlating with local adaptive immune signatures. In line with prior mouse data, here, we show in rhesus macaques that intravenous BCG enhances innate cytokine production associated with changes in H3K27 acetylation typical of trained immunity. Alternative delivery of BCG does not alter the cytokine production of unfractionated bronchial lavage cells. However, mucosal but not intradermal vaccination, either with BCG or the M. tuberculosis-derived candidate MTBVAC, enhances innate cytokine production by blood- and bone marrow-derived monocytes associated with metabolic rewiring, typical of trained immunity. These results provide support to strategies for improving TB vaccination and, more broadly, modulating innate immunity via mucosal surfaces.

Abstract: Loss of hair cells from vestibular epithelium results in balance dysfunction. The current therapeutic regimen for vestibular diseases is limited. Upon injury or Atoh1 overexpression, hair cell replacement occurs rapidly in the mammalian utricle, suggesting a promising approach to induce vestibular hair cell regeneration. In this study, we applied simultaneous gentamicin-mediated hair cell ablation and Atoh1 overexpression to induce neonatal utricular hair cell formation in vitro. We confirmed that type I hair cells were the primary targets of gentamicin. Furthermore, injury and Atoh1 overexpression promoted hair cell regeneration in a timely and efficient manner through robust viral transfection. Hair cells regenerated with type II characteristics in the striola and type I/II characteristics in non-sensory regions. Rare EdU+/myosin7a+ cells in sensory regions and robust EdU+/myosin7a+ signals in ectopic regions indicate that transdifferentiation of supporting cells in situ, and mitosis and differentiation of non-sensory epithelial cells in ectopic regions, are sources of regenerative hair cells. Distinct regeneration patterns in in situ and ectopic regions suggested robust plasticity of vestibular non-sensory epithelium, generating more developed hair cell subtypes and thus providing a promising stem cell-like source of hair cells. These findings suggest that simultaneously causing injury and overexpressing Atoh1 promotes hair cell regeneration efficacy and maturity, thus expanding the understanding of ectopic plasticity in neonatal vestibular organs.

Abstract: Summary
Replacement of today’s established chemical production processes by “green” sustainable alternatives has become a scientific priority. The oxidative conversion of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) to the biopolymer component 2.5-furandicarboxylic acid paired with green electrolytic hydrogen production is a promising emerging green process. Here, we present a family of active selective and stable interlayer anion-tuned NiX (X = Fe, Mn, Co, V) bimetallic-layered, double-hydroxide catalysts for the selective oxidation of 5-HMF to 2.5-furandicarboxylic acid in a zero-gap MEA-type electrolyzer. We report that tuning the structural interlayer distance of the catalyst by anion exchange gives rise to previously unachieved catalytic performance for the anodic production of the biopolymer building block. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry analysis reveals the electrode window for the perfectly selective HMF conversion. The role of the catalyst dopants, their real surface areas, the stability of the catalytic interface, and aspects of its favorable techno-economics are discussed.

Abstract: Non-muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) has been reported to be involved in the carcinogenesis and malignant progression of various human tumors. However, the role and potential mechanism of NMIIA in the biological functions and apoptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In this study, we found that NMIIA was overexpressed in CRC tissues and significantly associated with poor survival in CRC patients. In addition, NMIIA promoted CRC cell proliferation and invasion via activating the AMPK/mTOR pathway in vitro, and NMIIA knockdown inhibited CRC growth in vivo. Meanwhile, NMIIA knockdown downregulated the CSCs markers (CD44 and CD133) expression in CRC cells. Furthermore, AMPK/mTOR pathway activation effectively reversed the NMIIA knockdown-induced inhibition of proliferation, invasion and stemness in CRC cells. Finally, NMIIA protects CRC cells from 5-FU-induced apoptosis and proliferation inhibition through the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that NMIIA plays a pivotal role in CRC growth and progression by regulating AMPK/mTOR pathway activation, and it may act as a novel therapeutic target prognostic factor in CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Small open reading frames (smORFs) and their encoded microproteins play central roles in microbes. However, there is a vast unexplored space of smORFs within human-associated microbes. A recent bioinformatic analysis used evolutionary conservation signals to enhance prediction of small protein families. To facilitate the annotation of specific smORFs, we introduce SmORFinder. This tool combines profile hidden Markov models of each smORF family and deep learning models that better generalize to smORF families not seen in the training set, resulting in predictions enriched for Ribo-seq translation signals. Feature importance analysis reveals that the deep learning models learn to identify Shine-Dalgarno sequences, deprioritize the wobble position in each codon, and group codon synonyms found in the codon table. A core-genome analysis of 26 bacterial species identifies several core smORFs of unknown function. We pre-compute smORF annotations for thousands of RefSeq isolate genomes and Human Microbiome Project metagenomes and provide these data through a public web portal.

Abstract: The development of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is accompanied by B cell hyperproliferation and mutation. Our previous study identified aberrant expression of BST-2 (also known as Tetherin/CD317) in B cells from either the peripheral blood or infiltrated salivary glands. However, the roles of BST-2 in the regulation of B cell activation remain unknown. In this study, we identified that BST-2 can respond to BAFF simulation but not to other B cell simulators in neoplastic B cell lines. A CCK-8 assay, an EdU assay and Annexin V/PI staining indicated that BST-2 inhibition attenuated BAFF-enhanced proliferation and survival in both Raji cells and Daudi cells. Screening of BAFF-related signaling in neoplastic B-lymphoid cells indicated that BST-2 was involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling upon BAFF simulation. However, inhibition of NF-κB by JSH-23 significantly reduced the proliferation and survival of Raji and Daudi cells under both normal and BAFF-simulated conditions. Collectively, our results indicate that BST-2/Tetherin is a BAFF-responsive membrane factor involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling, thereby assisting in the proliferation and survival of neoplastic B-lymphoid cells. Our study provides a potential molecular mechanism underlying aberrant overactivation of B cells upon SS development.

Abstract: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease caused by gradual accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes. The majority of CLL cases are accompanied by chemoresistance. Early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) is a crucial contributor to B-cell lymphopoiesis. This study is to explore the effect of EBF1 on CLL cell progression and its involvement in regulating the signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) pathway. We conducted a correlation analysis between EBF1 and the clinical characteristics of CLL patients. Subsequently, EBF1 was overexpressed by transfection with EBF1 overexpression plasmid and the STAT5 pathway was also blocked by treatment with SH-4-54 in isolated CD20+ B lymphocytes to investigate their roles in the regulation of cellular functions. STAT5, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) expression and their phosphorylation levels were determined by quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses. The in vivo effects of EBF1 on tumor growth were evaluated using a xenotransplant model. Downregulation of EBF1 was observed in CD20+ B lymphocytes of CLL patients. EBF1 overexpression disrupted the activation of STAT5 pathway, as evidenced by decreased expression and phosphorylation levels of STAT5 and JAK2. Furthermore, overexpression of EBF1 repressed viability and cell cycle entry, and increased apoptosis of CD20+ B lymphocytes by inhibiting the STAT5 pathway. Finally, EBF1 exerted antitumor effects in nude mice. Overall, our study elucidates the inhibitory role of EBF1 in CLL through inactivation of the STAT5 pathway, which may provide new targets for CLL treatment.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) ex vivo expansion is critical in facilitating their widespread clinical application. NF-κB pathway is implicated in the energy homeostasis and metabolic adaptation. To explore the effect of NF-κB pathway on the ex vivo HSPC expansion and metabolism, the 50 nM–1 μM inhibitor of NF-κB pathway TPCA-1 was used to expand cord blood derived CD34+ cells in serum-free culture. The expansion folds, function, mitochondrial profile and metabolism of HSPCs were determined. After 10 days of culture with 100 nM TPCA-1, the expansion of total cells， CD34+CD38− cells， and CD34+CD38−CD45RA−CD90+CD49f+ cells were significantly increased compared to the cytokine priming alone. Notably, TPCA-1 treatment generated ~ 2-fold greater percentage of CD34+EPCR+ and CD34+CD38−CD45RA−CD90+CD49f+ cells compared to cytokine only conditions. Moreover, TPCA-1 expanded CD34+ cells displayed enhanced serial colonies forming potential and secondary expansion capability. NF-κB inhibition increased the expression of self-renewal related genes, while downregulated the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis regulator (Pgc1α) and mitochondrial chaperones and proteases (ClpP, Hsp10, Hsp60). Mitochondrial mass and membrane potential were markedly decreased with TPCA-1 treatment, leading to the reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in HSPCs. NF-κB inhibition displayed augmented glycolysis rate with compromising mitochondrial metabolism. This study demonstrated that NF-κB pathway inhibition improved glycolysis and limited ROS production that promoted the ex vivo expansion and maintenance of functional HSPCs.

Abstract: Summary
Three-terminal (3T) and four-terminal (4T) tandem photovoltaic (PV) devices using various materials have been increasingly reported in the literature, but measurement standards are lacking. Here, multiterminal devices measured as functions of two load variables are characterized unambiguously as functions of three device voltages or currents on hexagonal plots. We demonstrate these measurement techniques using two GaInP/GaAs tandem solar cells, with a middle contact between the two subcells, as example 3T devices with both series-connected and reverse-connected subcells. Coupling mechanisms between the subcells are quantified within the context of a simple equivalent optoelectronic circuit. Electrical and optical coupling mechanisms are most clearly revealed using coupled dark measurements. These measurements are sensitive enough to observe very small luminescent coupling from the bottom subcell to the top subcell in the prototype 3T device. Quick simplified measurement techniques are also discussed within the context of the complete characterization.

Abstract: The treatment and evolution of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) has undergone important changes in the last years with the emergence of targeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, antibody-drug conjugates, and bispecific antibodies. Nevertheless, a significant portion of patients remains refractory or relapsed (R/R) to the new therapeutic modalities, representing thus an unmet medical need. The use of CAR-T cells for the treatment of B-NHL patients has shown to be a promising therapy with impressive results in patients with R/R disease. The expectations are as high as the imminent approval of CAR-T cell therapy in Brazil, which it is expected to impact the prognosis of R/R B-NHL. The aim of this manuscript is to offer a consensus of specialists in the field of onco-hematology and cellular therapy, working in Brazil and United States, in order to discuss and offer recommendations in the present setting of the use of CAR-T cells for patients with B-NHL.

Abstract: Summary
The innovation of versatile multi-component reaction modes for one-pot assembly of polyfunctional arenes is a highly challenging and important goal in organic synthesis. Here, we report that polyfunctional arenes with three contiguous and different substituents can be assembled efficiently under mild conditions in a one-pot, four-component modular way by orchestrating mechanistically sequential and compatible palladium-catalyzed domino carbopalladation of arynes and norbornene (NBE)-mediated Catellani processes. Optimization of the reaction conditions reveals that balancing the reaction parameters in general, and loading amount of NBE especially, is a linchpin for the reaction. Studies of the reaction scope indicate a wide selection of functional groups, including complex natural product-derived substructures, can be tolerated, making it appealing for early- and late-stage assemblies. Post-transformations show that not only the newly installed substituents but also the parent aromatic nucleus can be derived conveniently, enabling polyfunctional arenes with diverse substitutions in a concise manner.

Abstract: Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) cells are certainly an important therapy for patients with relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancies. Currently, there are five CAR-T cell products approved by the FDA but several research groups and/or biopharmaceutical companies are encouraged to develop new products based on CAR cells using T or other cell types. Production of CAR cells requires intensive work from the basic, pre-clinical to translational levels, aiming to overcome technical difficulties and failure in the production. At least five key common steps are needed for the manipulation of T-lymphocytes (or other cells), such as: cell type selection, activation, gene delivery, cell expansion and final product formulation. However, reproducible manufacturing of high-quality clinical-grade CAR cell products is still required to apply this technology to a greater number of patients. This chapter will discuss the present and future development of new CAR designs that are safer and more effective to improve this therapy, achieving more selective killing of malignant cells and less toxicity to be applied in the clinical setting.

Abstract: Summary
Despite possessing only 32 residues, the tsetse thrombin inhibitor (TTI) is among the most potent anticoagulants described, with sub-picomolar inhibitory activity against thrombin. Unexpectedly, TTI isolated from the fly is 2000-fold more active and 180 Da heavier than synthetic and recombinant variants. We predicted the presence of a tyrosine O-sulfate post-translational modification of TTI, prompting us to investigate the effect of the modification on anticoagulant activity. A combination of chemical synthesis and functional assays was used to reveal that sulfation significantly improved the inhibitory activity of TTI against thrombin. Using X-ray crystallography, we show that the N-terminal sulfated segment of TTI binds the basic exosite II of thrombin, establishing interactions similar to those of physiologic substrates, while the C-terminal segment abolishes the catalytic activity of thrombin. This non-canonical mode of inhibition, coupled with its potency and small size, makes TTI an attractive scaffold for the design of novel antithrombotics.

Abstract: Summary
Nickel-rich cathodes (LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2, x > 0.6) permit higher energy in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries but suffer from accelerated degradation at potentials above 4.1 V versus Li/Li+. Here, we present a proof-of-concept in situ pouch cell and methodology for correlative 2D synchrotron transmission X-ray microscopy with 3D lab-based micro-CT. XANES analysis of the TXM data enables tracking of Ni edge energy within and between the polycrystalline NMC811 particles embedded in the operating electrode through its initial delithiation. By using edge energy as a proxy, state-of-charge heterogeneities can be tracked at the nanoscale, revealing the role of cracked particles as potential nucleation points for failure and highlighting the challenges in achieving uniform (de-)lithiation. We propose, in future work, to leverage the pouch cell design presented here for longitudinal TXM-XANES studies of nickel-rich cathodes across multiple cycles and operating variables and investigate the effect of dopants and microstructural optimization in mitigating degradation.

Abstract: Background
Angiogenesis is an essential step in tissue engineering. MSC exosomes play an important role in angiogenesis. Functional biomolecules in exosomes vested by the culture microenvironment can be transferred to recipient cells and affects their effect. 3D culture can improve the proliferation and activity of MSCs. However, whether exosomes derived from 3D culture of MSCs have an enhanced effect on angiogenesis is unclear.
Methods
Herein, we compared the bioactivity of exosomes produced by conventional 2D culture (2D-exos) and 3D culture (3D-exos) of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) in angiogenesis.
Results
A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that 3D-exos exhibited stronger effects on HUVEC cell proliferation, migration, tube formation, and in vivo angiogenesis compared with 2D-exos. Moreover, the superiority of 3D-exos might be attributed to the activation of HMGB1/AKT signaling.
Conclusions
These results indicate that exosomes from 3D culture of MSCs may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for pro-angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Stimuli-responsive materials have gained a lot of attention recently because of their promising use in data storage, drug release, sensing, and anti-counterfeiting. Herein, we report spiropyran-silane derivatives with dual reversible characteristics as photo- and mechanochromic materials. These molecules are susceptible to ultraviolet (UV) light and exhibit efficient and reversible solid-state photoswitching under alternating UV light and heat/visible light treatment for at least 100 cycles. Meanwhile, they can change colors under slight grinding. Additionally, they have the following advantages as anti-counterfeiting materials: (1) they show high contrast and reversibility to design complex anti-counterfeit patterns; (2) the response and recovery is fast, and the validations can be realized in a short time; (3) they can achieve multiple stimuli responses of both fluorescence and color changes controlled by either UV light or mechanical force. In particular, based on mechanochromism, handwriting can be used as another guarantee to strengthen anti-counterfeiting. The multiple guarantees will greatly improve the reliability of anti-counterfeiting measures, making counterfeiting more difficult.

MicroRNA-92a -mediated endothelial to mesenchymal transition controls vein graft neointimal lesion formation,

Abstract: Purpose
Long-term failure of vein grafts due to neointimal hyperplasia remains an important problem in coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) contributes to vein graft vascular remodeling. However, there is little study on microRNA-mediated EndMT contributions to neointimal formation in vein graft. We hypothesized that microRNA-92a (miR-92a) might play an important role in determining EndMT contributions to neointimal formation.
Methods
miR-92a and EndMT-related proteins detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot in vitro and in vivo. Adeno-associated virus 6 (AAV6) delivery gene therapy was used to inhibit neointimal formation in vivo. The intimal hyperplasia of vein grafts was measured by HE staining, the expression of EndMT-related protein in vein grafts was measured by immunofluorescence. Immunohistochemistry and luciferase assay were used to detect potential targets of miR-92a.
Results
The expression of miR-92a was found to be upregulated in neointimal hyperplasic lesions after vein grafting. Using cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we show that TGF-β1 treatment of HUVECs significantly increased miR-92a expression and induced EndMT, characterized by suppression of endothelial-specific markers (CD31 and VE-cadherin) and an increase in mesenchymal-specific markers (a-SMA and vimentin), while inhibition of miR-92a expression blunted EndMT in cultured HUVECs. Furthermore, AAV6 mediated miR-92a suppression gene therapy effectively resulted in decreased EndMT and less neointimal formation in vein grafts in vivo. We further identified that integrin alpha 5 (ITGA5) is a potential target gene involved in the development of neointima formation in these vein grafts.
Conclusion
This data suggests that neointimal formation does not solely rely on vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic switching but is also related to EndMT, and miR-92a-mediated EndMT is an important mechanism underlying neointimal formation in vein grafts.

Abstract: Summary
Universal red blood cells (RBCs) differentiated from O-negative human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) could find applications in transfusion medicine. Given that each transfusion unit of blood requires 2 trillion RBCs, efficient bioprocesses need to be developed for large-scale in vitro generation of RBCs. We have developed a scalable suspension agitation culture platform for differentiating hiPSC-microcarrier aggregates into functional RBCs and have demonstrated scalability of the process starting with 6 well plates and finally demonstrating in 500 mL spinner flasks. Differentiation of the best-performing hiPSCs generated 0.85 billion erythroblasts in 50 mL cultures with cell densities approaching 1.7 × 107 cells/mL. Functional (oxygen binding, hemoglobin characterization, membrane integrity, and fluctuations) and transcriptomics evaluations showed minimal differences between hiPSC-derived and adult-derived RBCs. The scalable agitation suspension culture differentiation process we describe here could find applications in future large-scale production of RBCs in controlled bioreactors.

Abstract: Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a multifactorial process triggered when an organ is subjected to transiently reduced blood supply. The result is a cascade of pathological complications and organ damage due to the production of reactive oxygen species following reperfusion. The present study aims to evaluate the role of activated calcium-sensing receptor (CaR)-cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE)/hydrogen sulfide (H2S) pathway in I/R injury. Firstly, an I/R rat model with CSE knockout was constructed. Transthoracic echocardiography, TTC and HE staining were performed to determine the cardiac function of rats following I/R Injury, followed by TUNEL staining observation on apoptosis. Besides, with the attempt to better elucidate how CaR-CSE/H2S affects I/R, in-vitro culture of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) was conducted with gadolinium chloride (GdCl3, a CaR agonist), H2O2, siRNA against CSE (siCSE), or W7 (a CaM inhibitor). The interaction between CSE and CaM was subsequently detected. Plasma oxidative stress indexes, H2S and CSE, and apoptosis-related proteins were all analyzed following cell apoptosis. We found that H2S elevation led to the improvement whereas CSE knockdown decreased cardiac function in rats with I/R injury. Moreover, oxidative stress injury in I/R rats with CSE knockout was aggravated, while the increased expression of H2S and CSE in the aortic tissues resulted in alleviated the oxidative stress injury. Moreover, increased H2S and CSE levels were found to inhibit cell apoptotic ability in the aortic tissues after I/R injury, thus attenuating oxidative stress injury, accompanied by inhibited expression of apoptosis-related proteins. In HCAECs following oxidative stress treatment, siCSE and CaM inhibitor were observed to reverse the protection of CaR agonist. Coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed the interaction between CSE and CaM. Taken together, all above-mentioned data provides evidence that activation of the CaR-CSE/H2S pathway may confer a potent protective effect in cardiac I/R injury.

Abstract: Extraordinary progress has been made over the last decade in the treatment of multiple myeloma with the incorporation of new drugs, particularly proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies. The combined use of innovative drugs, already in the first lines of treatment, has led to an expressive increase in the survival of these patients. However, the approach to relapse remains a great challenge, and the disease continues to be incurable. In this scenario, modern immunotherapy has gained the limelight, especially with its recent use of CAR-T cells in clinical trials, as in the case of multiple myeloma, having the BCMA as the primary target. The results are impactful in the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have had multiple relapses and are triple- and penta-refractory. In this Consensus, we have brought together a group of experts in multiple myeloma to discuss and forward their recommendations for the future, which we hope is very near, incorporating the CAR-T in our country.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) are being developed as therapeutics and are a major contributor to neutralizing antibody responses elicited by infection. Here, we describe a deep mutational scanning method to map how all amino-acid mutations in the RBD affect antibody binding and apply this method to 10 human monoclonal antibodies. The escape mutations cluster on several surfaces of the RBD that broadly correspond to structurally defined antibody epitopes. However, even antibodies targeting the same surface often have distinct escape mutations. The complete escape maps predict which mutations are selected during viral growth in the presence of single antibodies. They further enable the design of escape-resistant antibody cocktails—including cocktails of antibodies that compete for binding to the same RBD surface but have different escape mutations. Therefore, complete escape-mutation maps enable rational design of antibody therapeutics and assessment of the antigenic consequences of viral evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Improving stability has become one of the most important objectives in the practical application of perovskite photovoltaics. Here, we develop encapsulated mesoporous-carbon perovskite solar mini-modules that retain more than 92% of their initial performance after 3,000 h of damp-heat aging at 85°C/85% relative humidity, while maintaining 90% of the initial value (T90) for 3,260 h, equivalent to 20-year stability in outdoor use. This stability is attributed to the light-induced performance increase phenomenon. The mechanism is associated with the organic molecules 5-ammoniumvaleric acid and methylammonium forming a quasi-2-dimensional perovskite/metal oxide interface with a positive effect on charge transport and ion migration. This work extends our present understanding of the mechanism underlying the light-induced performance and stability increase.

Abstract: Summary
Candida auris is an emerging multi-drug-resistant human fungal pathogen. C. auris skin colonization results in environmental shedding, which underlies hospital transmissions, and predisposes patients to subsequent infections. We developed a murine skin topical exposure model for C. auris to dissect risk factors for colonization and to test interventions that might protect patients. We demonstrate that C. auris establishes long-term residence within the skin tissue compartment, which would elude clinical surveillance. The four clades of C. auris, with geographically distinct origins, differ in their abilities to colonize murine skin, mirroring epidemiologic findings. The IL-17 receptor signaling and specific arms of immunity protect mice from long-term C. auris skin colonization. We further determine that commonly used chlorhexidine antiseptic serves as a protective and decolonizing agent against C. auris. This translational model facilitates an integrated approach to develop strategies to combat the unfolding global outbreaks of C. auris and other skin-associated microbial pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint blockade, have the potential to significantly impact treatments for diverse tumor types. At present, response failures and immune-related adverse events remain significant issues, which could be addressed using optimized combination therapies. Through a cell-based chemical screen of ∼200,000 compounds, we identified that HSP90 inhibitors robustly decrease PD-L1 surface expression, through a mechanism that appears to involve the regulation of master transcriptional regulators (i.e., STAT-3 and c-Myc). Interestingly, HSP90 inhibitors were found to also modulate the surface expression of additional checkpoint proteins (i.e., PD-L2). In the MC-38 syngeneic mouse tumor model, HSP90 inhibition was found to dramatically reduce PD-L1 surface expression on isolated live tumor cells and, consistent with recent findings, was found to increase the number of activated CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment. These findings provide further rationale to explore HSP90 inhibitors as part of combination immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

Abstract: In order to develop strategies to regenerate complex tissues in mammals, understanding the role of signaling in regeneration competent species and mammalian development is of critical importance. Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF-8) signaling has an essential role in limb morphogenesis and blastema outgrowth. Therefore, we aimed to study the effect of FGF-8b on the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have tremendous potential for therapeutic use of cell-based therapy. Rat adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) and muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) were isolated and cultured in growth medium and various types of differentiation medium (osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, tenogenic, and myogenic medium) with or without FGF-8b supplementation. We found that FGF-8b induced robust proliferation regardless of culture medium. Genes related to limb development were upregulated in ADSCs by FGF-8b supplementation. Moreover, FGF-8b enhanced chondrogenic differentiation and suppressed adipogenic and tenogenic differentiation in ADSCs. Osteogenic differentiation was not affected by FGF-8b supplementation. FGF-8b was found to enhance myofiber formation in rat MPCs. Overall, this study provides foundational knowledge on the effect of FGF-8b in the proliferation and fate determination of MSCs and provides insight in its potential efficacy for musculoskeletal therapies.

Abstract: The reprogramming of cancer cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can capture entire cancer genomes, and thus create genetically faithful models of human cancers. By providing stringent genetically clonal conditions, iPSC modeling can also unveil non-genetic sources of cancer heterogeneity and provide a unique opportunity to study them separately from genetic sources, as we recently showed in an iPSC-based model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Genetically clonal iPSCs, derived from a patient with AML, reproduce, upon hematopoietic differentiation, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity with all the hallmarks of a leukemia stem cell (LSC) hierarchy. Here we discuss the lessons that can be learned about the LSC state, its plasticity, stability and genetic and epigenetic determinants from iPSC modeling. We also discuss the practical and translational implications of exploiting AML-iPSCs to prospectively isolate large numbers of iLSCs for large-scale experiments, such as screens, and for discovery of new therapeutic targets specific to AML LSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial regeneration is critical for barrier maintenance and organ function after intestinal injury, although the repair mechanisms are unclear. Here, we found that Bach2 deficiency promotes intestinal epithelial cell proliferation during homeostasis. Moreover, genetic inactivation of Bach2 in mouse intestinal epithelium facilitated crypt regeneration after irradiation, resulting in a reduction in mortality. RNA-sequencing analysis of isolated crypts revealed that Bach2 deficiency altered the expression of numerous genes, including those regulating double-strand break repair. Mechanistic characterizations indicated that Bach2 deletion facilitated DNA repair in intestinal crypt cells, as evidenced by faster resolution of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci in Bach2−/− crypt cells, compared with Bach2+/+ control. Together, our studies highlight that Bach2 deficiency promotes intestinal regeneration by accelerating DNA repair in intestinal stem cells after radiation damage.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the formulation and manufacturing parameters that lead to higher energy density and longevity is critical to designing energy-dense graphite electrodes for battery applications. A limited dataset that includes 27 different formulation, manufacturing protocols, and performance properties is reported. Input parameters from formulation and manufacturing are varied: slurry composition, mixing protocol, electrode coating gap size, drying temperature, coating speed, and calendering. Measurable outputs from the rheological characteristics, adhesion, and electrochemical testing are recorded. A database with the inputs and output parameters is populated and used to train an artificial intelligence model. Validation of the model is performed upon test data and an optimized electrode formulation and manufacturing process predicted. The electrode manufactured using the model process shows excellent cycle life and capacity agreement to prediction. The data model can be used to predict and design the formulation and manufacturing process to produce thick, high-coat-weight, graphite-based electrodes.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are gene expression regulators and they have been implicated in acquired kidney diseases and in renal development, mostly through animal studies. We hypothesized that the miR-199a/214 cluster regulates human kidney development. We detected its expression in human embryonic kidneys by in situ hybridization. To mechanistically study the cluster, we used 2D and 3D human embryonic stem cell (hESC) models of kidney development. After confirming expression in each model, we inhibited the miRNAs using lentivirally transduced miRNA sponges. This reduced the WT1+ metanephric mesenchyme domain in 2D cultures. Sponges did not prevent the formation of 3D kidney-like organoids. These organoids, however, contained dysmorphic glomeruli, downregulated WT1, aberrant proximal tubules, and increased interstitial capillaries. Thus, the miR-199a/214 cluster fine-tunes differentiation of both metanephric mesenchymal-derived nephrons and kidney endothelia. While clinical implications require further study, it is noted that patients with heterozygous deletions encompassing this miRNA locus can have malformed kidneys.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation is the paradigm for stem cell therapies. The protocol described here enables quantitative assessment of the body-wide HSPC reconstitution of different mature hematopoietic cells in mice based on their presence in circulating blood. The method determines donor-derived mature cell populations per mouse, over time, by quantitatively obtaining their absolute numbers in the peripheral blood and utilizing previously assessed tissue-distribution factors. A Markov-based birth/death computational model accounts for the drastic differences in mature cell half-lives. By quantifying the number of cells produced and eliminating host variability, the protocol can be used to directly compare the lineage output of different types of HSPCs on a per cell basis, thereby clarifying the lineage potential and expansion capacity of different cell populations. These protocols were developed for hematopoiesis, but can readily be extended to other contexts by simply replacing the cell types and distributions.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as cellular signal transducers through repression of protein translation. Elucidating targets using bioinformatics and traditional quantitation methods is often insufficient to uncover global miRNA function. Herein, alteration of protein function caused by miRNA-185 (miR-185), an immunometabolic miRNA, was determined using activity-based protein profiling, transcriptomics, and lipidomics. Fluorophosphonate-based activity-based protein profiling of miR-185-induced changes to human liver cells revealed that exclusively metabolic serine hydrolase enzymes were regulated in activity, some with roles in lipid and endocannabinoid metabolism. Lipidomic analysis linked enzymatic changes to levels of cellular lipid species, such as components of very-low-density lipoprotein particles. Additionally, inhibition of one miR-185 target, monoglyceride lipase, led to decreased hepatitis C virus levels in an infectious model. Overall, the approaches used here were able to identify key functional changes in serine hydrolases caused by miR-185 that are targetable pharmacologically, such that a small molecule inhibitor can recapitulate the miRNA phenotype.

Abstract: The successful function of cells is importantly contributed by lipid membranes that are more than a simple physical barrier. The major components of cellular membranes are lipids, in particular glycerophospholipids, that have the capacity to assemble spontaneously into vesicles containing a lipid bilayer after exposure to an aqueous milieu due to their amphiphilic characteristics. The lipid capacity to form vesicles and encapsulate substrates has been proposed as a fundamental event during the biogenesis of cells. However, the stability of small vesicles is compromised during their expansion into larger and more complex particles. Recent observations by (Cornell et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 116:17239–17244, 2019) have shown that the insertion of amino acids into rudimentary vesicles could play a stabilizing role that was critical to the formation of early cells. Fatty acids were likely substituted by glycerophospholipids and amino acids replaced by polypeptides during the evolution of protocells. Thus, archaic peptides displaying lipid-binding and membrane-penetrating capacities could have played a key function in the development of current cells. In this regard, heat shock proteins (HSP), particularly the Hsp70 (HSPA) and small HSP (HSPB) families, could have portrayed that role. Indeed, bacterial DnaK is closest in sequence to the earliest members of the Hsp70 family and inserts into lipid membranes spontaneously. Moreover, extensive studies by the Vigh group have shown that, certainly, Hsp70s stabilize membranes. Thus, the ability of ancestral HSP70s and small HSPs to associate with lipids and stabilize membranes could have been a fundamental event in the genesis of cells.

Abstract: Summary
Utilizing a phenotypic screen, we identified chemical matter that increased astrocytic apoE secretion in vitro. We designed a clickable photoaffinity probe based on a pyrrolidine lead compound and carried out probe-based quantitative chemical proteomics in human astrocytoma CCF-STTG1 cells to identify liver x receptor β (LXRβ) as the target. Binding of the small molecule ligand stabilized LXRβ, as shown by cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). In addition, we identified a probe-modified peptide by mass spectrometry and proposed a model where the photoaffinity probe is bound in the ligand-binding pocket of LXRβ. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that the lead chemical matter bound directly to LXRβ, and our results highlight the power of chemical proteomic approaches to identify the target of a phenotypic screening hit. Additionally, the LXR photoaffinity probe and lead compound described herein may serve as valuable tools to further evaluate the LXR pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-based therapeutics are a breakthrough in cancer treatment; however, they are hampered by constitutive activation, which leads to worrisome side effects. Engineering CAR-T cells to be as tightly controllable as possible remains a topic of ongoing investigation. Here, we report a photoswitchable approach that uses a mediator for the at-will regulation of CAR-T cells. This mediator carries dual folate and fluorescein isothiocyanate moieties tethered by an ortho-nitrobenzyl ester photocleavable linker. CAR-T cells were shown to be highly cytotoxic to targeted cells only in the presence of the mediator and acted in a dose-dependent manner. The toxicity of CAR-T cells can be rapidly terminated by cleavage of the mediator, and the effects of CAR-T cells can be activated again by resupplementation with the mediator without compromising tumor therapy. The approach described here provides a direction for enhancing the controllability of CAR-T cells and can likely be applied in other immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Polymer fibers with liquid crystals (LCs) in the core have potential as autonomous sensors of airborne volatile organic compounds (VOCs), with a high surface-to-volume ratio enabling fast and sensitive response and an attractive non-woven textile form factor. We demonstrate their ability to continuously and quantitatively measure the concentration of toluene, cyclohexane, and isopropanol as representative VOCs, via the impact of each VOC on the LC birefringence. The response is fully reversible and repeatable over several cycles, the response time can be as low as seconds, and high sensitivity is achieved when the operating temperature is near the LC-isotropic transition temperature. We propose that a broad operating temperature range can be realized by combining fibers with different LC mixtures, yielding autonomous VOC sensors suitable for integration in apparel or in furniture that can compete with existing consumer-grade electronic VOC sensors in terms of sensitivity and response speed.

Abstract: The purpose of this research was to assess the effects of a microRNA (miRNA) cluster on platelet production. Human chromosome 19q13.41 harbors an evolutionarily conserved cluster of three miRNA genes (MIR99B, MIRLET7E, MIR125A) within 727 base-pairs. We now report that levels of miR-99b-5p, miR-let7e-5p and miR-125a-5p are strongly correlated in human platelets, and all are positively associated with platelet count, but not white blood count or hemoglobin level. Although the cluster regulates hematopoietic stem cell proliferation, the function of this genomic locus in megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation and platelet production is unknown. Furthermore, studies of individual miRNAs do not represent broader effects in the context of a cluster. To address this possibility, MK/platelet lineage-specific Mir-99b/let7e/125a knockout mice were generated. Compared to wild type littermates, cluster knockout mice had significantly lower platelet counts and reduced MK proplatelet formation, but no differences in MK numbers, ploidy, maturation or ultra-structural morphology, and no differences in platelet function. Compared to wild type littermates, knockout mice showed similar survival after pulmonary embolism. The major conclusions are that the effect of the Mir-99b/let7e/125a cluster is confined to a late stage of thrombopoiesis, and this effect on platelet number is uncoupled from platelet function.

Abstract: Summary
Photocatalytic overall water splitting for converting solar energy into hydrogen is a potential means of pursuing a renewable, scalable, and eco-friendly energy source. It is challenging to achieve the 5%–10% solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency needed to be economically viable for renewable solar hydrogen production. Here, we report a heterojunction in which the thickness within the space charge region can be precisely adjusted to enhance the redox capacity, increase light absorption, and reduce carrier transport distance. The fully stacked two catalysts and aqueous-solution-exposed surfaces exhibit advantages of an enhanced built-in-electric field and a highly effective surface area. Based on that, an Ag3PO4/CdS/Pt photocatalyst exhibits overall water splitting with an STH efficiency, dramatically improving from zero to 0.75% under visible light at ambient pressure by tuning CdS/Ag3PO4 thickness from 200 nm/120 nm to 60 nm/30 nm. The STH efficiency can be further enhanced to 2% under visible light in 0.01 mol L−1 Na2S solution.

Abstract: Pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) could be adoptively transferred by splenic T cells in rats, and innate immunity should play critical roles in T cell activation. However, in pre-clinical stage, the activation mechanism of innate cells like macrophages remains unclear. Here we found that PIA was dependent on macrophages since cell depletion alleviated disease severity. Splenic macrophages of PIA rats showed M1 phenotypic shifting. The quantitative proteomics analysis suggested that macrophages initiated metabolic reprogramming with the conversion of aerobic oxidation to glycolysis in response to pristane in vivo. Notably, macrophages treated with pristane showed mitochondrial dysregulation and increased glycolysis flux and enzyme activity. Additionally, TNFα production, strongly associating with the glycolysis enzyme Ldha/Ldhb, could be reduced as glycolysis was inhibited or be enhanced as citrate cycle was blocked. This work provides detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms of pristane-mediated metabolic reprogramming in macrophages and suggests a new therapeutic strategy for arthritic disorders.

Abstract: Background
The proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and subsequent pulmonary vascular remodeling leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Understanding the underlying mechanisms and identifying molecules that can suppress PASMCs proliferation is critical for developing effective pharmacological treatment. We previously showed that plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) inhibited human PASMC (hPASMCs) proliferation in vitro. However, its inhibitory effect on PAH remains to be determined, and the mechanism remains to be illustrated.
Methods
We compared serum PAI-2 levels between PAH patients and healthy controls, and examined the correlation between PAI-2 level and disease severity. In monocrotaline-induced PAH rats, we examined the effects of exogenous PAI-2 administration on pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH development. The effect of PAI-2 and potential mechanisms was further examined in cultured hPASMCs.
Results
The serum PAI-2 was decreased in PAH patients compared with controls. PAI-2 level was negatively correlated with mean pulmonary arterial pressure and estimated systolic pulmonary arterial pressure in ultrasonic cardiogram, while positively correlated with 6-min walking distance. In rats, administration of exogenous PAI-2 significantly reversed monocrotaline-induced PAH, as indicated by the decrease in right ventricle systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy index and percent media thickness of pulmonary arterioles. Further mechanistic investigation in hPASMCs showed that PAI-2 inhibited cell proliferation by preventing the activation of PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways.
Conclusion
PAI-2 is downregulated in PAH patients. PAI-2 attenuates PAH development by suppressing hPASMCs proliferation via the inhibition of PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways. PAI-2 may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for PAH.

Abstract: The proliferation of mast cells (MCs) plays a crucial role in either physiological or pathological progression of human physical. C-Kit-mediated signaling pathway has been confirmed to play a key role in MCs proliferation, and the regulatory mechanisms of C-Kit-mediated MCs proliferation need to be further explored. Our previous study found that protein 4.1R could negatively regulate T cell receptor (TCR) mediated signal pathways in CD4+ T cells. Little is known about the function of 4.1R in C-Kit-mediated proliferation of MCs. In this study, P815-4.1R-/- cells were constructed by using CRISPR/Cas9 technique. Lack of 4.1R significantly enhanced P815 cells proliferation by accelerating the progression of cell cycle. 4.1R could also significantly alleviate the clinical symptoms of systemic mastocytosis (SM) and improve the overall survival of SM mice. Further study showed that 4.1R could interact directly with C-Kit to inhibit the activation of C-Kit-mediated Ras-Raf-MAPKs and PI3K-AKT signal pathways. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that protein 4.1R, a novel negative regulator, negatively regulates MCs proliferation by inhibiting C-Kit-mediated signal transduction, which maybe provide a potential target to the prevention and treatment of abnormal MCs proliferation-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Metal-organic framework (MOF) crystallization is governed by molecular assembly processes in the pre-nucleation stage. Yet, unravelling these pre-nucleation pathways and rationalizing their impact on crystal formation poses a great challenge since probing molecular-scale assemblies and macroscopic particles simultaneously is very complex. Herein, we present a multimodal, integrated approach to monitor MOF nucleation across multiple length scales by combining in situ optical spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and molecular simulations. This approach allows tracing initial metal-organic complexes in solution and their assembly into oligomeric nuclei and simultaneously probing particle formation. During Co-ZIF-67 nucleation, a metal-organic pool forms with a variety of complexes caused by ligand exchange and symmetry reduction reactions. We discriminate complexes capable of initiating nucleation from growth species required for oligomerization into frameworks. Co4-nuclei are observed, which grow into particles following autocatalytic kinetics. The geometric and compositional variability of metal-organic pool species clarifies long-debated amorphous zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-particle nucleation and non-classic pathways of MOF crystallization.

Abstract: Summary
Burgeoning applications of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and drug screening have broadened the usage of hiPSC-CMs and entailed their long-term storage. Cryopreservation is the most common approach to store hiPSC-CMs. However, the effects of cryopreservation and recovery on hiPSC-CMs remain poorly understood. Here, we characterized the transcriptome, electro-mechanical function, and drug response of fresh hiPSC-CMs without cryopreservation and recovered hiPSC-CMs from cryopreservation. We found that recovered hiPSC-CMs showed upregulation of cell cycle genes, similar or reduced contractility, Ca2+ transients, and field potential duration. When subjected to treatment of drugs that affect electrophysiological properties, recovered hiPSC-CMs showed an altered drug response and enhanced propensity for drug-induced cardiac arrhythmic events. In conclusion, fresh and recovered hiPSC-CMs do not always show comparable molecular and physiological properties. When cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs are used for assessing drug-induced cardiac liabilities, the altered drug sensitivity needs to be considered.

Abstract: Summary
Proteostasis deficiency in mutated ion channels leads to a variety of ion channel diseases that are caused by excessive endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and inefficient membrane trafficking. We investigated proteostasis maintenance of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, the primary mediators of neuronal inhibition in the mammalian central nervous system. We screened a structurally diverse, Food and Drug Administration-approved drug library and identified dinoprost (DNP) and dihydroergocristine (DHEC) as highly efficacious enhancers of surface expression of four epilepsy-causing trafficking-deficient mutant receptors. Furthermore, DNP and DHEC restore whole-cell and synaptic currents by incorporating mutated subunits into functional receptors. Mechanistic studies revealed that both drugs reduce subunit degradation by attenuating the Grp94/Hrd1/Sel1L/VCP-mediated ERAD pathway and enhance the subunit folding by promoting subunit interactions with major GABAA receptors-interacting chaperones, BiP and calnexin. In summary, we report that DNP and DHEC remodel the endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis network to restore the functional surface expression of mutant GABAA receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Many bacteria resist invasive DNA by incorporating sequences into CRISPR loci, which enable sequence-specific degradation. CRISPR systems have been well studied from isolate genomes, but culture-independent metagenomics provide a new window into their diversity. We profiled CRISPR loci and cas genes in the body-wide human microbiome using 2,355 metagenomes, yielding functional and taxonomic profiles for 2.9 million spacers by aligning the spacer content to each sample’s metagenome and corresponding gene families. Spacer and repeat profiles agree qualitatively with those from isolate genomes but expand their diversity by approximately 13-fold, with the highest spacer load present in the oral microbiome. The taxonomy of spacer sequences parallels that of their source community, with functional targets enriched for viral elements. When coupled with cas gene systems, CRISPR-Cas subtypes are highly site and taxon specific. Our analysis provides a comprehensive collection of natural CRISPR-cas loci and targets in the human microbiome.

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived endothelial cell (hiPSC-EC) transplantation is a promising therapy for treating peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, the poor differentiation of hiPSCs limits their clinical application. Therefore, finding key factors that regulate cellular differentiation is crucial for improving the therapeutic efficacy of hiPSC-EC transplantation. Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) is a key regulator of lipid metabolism and stem cell differentiation. However, it remains unknown whether SREPBP1 modulates hiPSC differentiation. In this study, we showed that SREBP1 expression was negatively associated with hiPSC differentiation and EC function. The results show that SREBP1 binds to the promoter region of miR199b-5p and suppresses its transcription, resulting in the activation of Notch1 signaling. Blocking SREBP1 increased both hiPSC differentiation and EC angiogenesis. These findings demonstrate a novel role for SREBP1 in hiPSC differentiation and EC angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The photoelectrochemical charge-transfer process occurring at semiconductor surfaces has important implications in the fields of solar fuels and biodetection. Usually, physical light sources located outside the liquid phase, such as a solar simulator, a light-emitting diode (LED), or a laser, are used for photoelectrochemical studies. Here, we report inducing photoelectrochemistry using an electrochemical source of light, that is, the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitted by a model co-reactant system. Results reveal that the ECL illumination can activate several semiconductor (SC) photoelectrodes based on n-type Si, n-type GaAs, and p-type Si. We demonstrate that this emitter-receiver concept, based on dual-light conversion, enables photoelectrochemical charge transfer at the solid/liquid interface, which correlates with the ECL intensity. The singularities of this concept lie in the fact that light emission and collection both occur in the liquid phase, that ECL is an easily miniaturizable photon source, and that the SC/liquid junction can be easily implemented. This approach may open perspectives for remote ECL detection strategies and original photoelectrochemical analytical systems.

Abstract: Summary
The negative differential resistance (NDR) effect been widely reported in the physical systems of traditional semiconductors, and corresponding theoretical mechanisms are known and applied. However, exploring the origin of NDR phenomena emerging in new structures or conditions remains a worthwhile challenge. Here, we report an experimental observation of an NDR effect based on SiO2/Si heterojunctions by injecting photo-generated carriers via vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation. We propose a complex competition mechanism between trap centers’ and recombination centers’ dominating carrier transport behavior. This is caused by the difference in spatial distribution of density of band-tail states and defect states in SiO2/Si. This work may inspire further consideration of SiO2/Si heterojunctions for electronic applications.

Abstract: Summary
The translation inhibitor rocaglamide A (RocA) has shown promising antitumor activity because it uniquely clamps eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A onto polypurine RNA for selective translational repression. As eIF4A has been speculated to be a unique target of RocA, alternative targets have not been investigated. Here, we reveal that DDX3 is another molecular target of RocA. Proximity-specific fluorescence labeling of an O-nitrobenzoxadiazole-conjugated derivative revealed that RocA binds to DDX3. RocA clamps the DDX3 protein onto polypurine RNA in an ATP-independent manner. Analysis of a de novo-assembled transcriptome from the plant Aglaia, a natural source of RocA, uncovered the amino acid critical for RocA binding. Moreover, ribosome profiling showed that because of the dominant-negative effect of RocA, high expression of eIF4A and DDX3 strengthens translational repression in cancer cells. This study indicates that sequence-selective clamping of DDX3 and eIF4A, and subsequent dominant-negative translational repression by RocA determine its tumor toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Immunomodulatory drugs can inhibit bacterial growth, yet their mechanism of action, spectrum, and clinical relevance remain unknown. Methotrexate (MTX), a first-line rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, inhibits mammalian dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), but whether it directly impacts gut bacteria is unclear. We show that MTX broadly alters the human gut microbiota. Drug sensitivity varied across strains, but the mechanism of action against DHFR appears conserved between mammalian and bacterial cells. RA patient microbiotas were sensitive to MTX, and changes in gut bacterial taxa and gene family abundance were distinct between responders and non-responders. Transplantation of post-treatment samples into germ-free mice given an inflammatory trigger led to reduced immune activation relative to pre-treatment controls, enabling identification of MTX-modulated bacterial taxa associated with intestinal and splenic immune cells. Thus, conservation in cellular pathways across domains of life can result in broad off-target drug effects on the human gut microbiota with consequences for immune function.

Abstract: Summary
Superwettability and photocatalysis are two important properties in interfacial science. Photocatalysts with stable (super)hydrophilicity and (super)hydrophobicity have been widely studied. However, to endow long-term switchable superwetting and photocatalysis on the same surface is rarely reported. Here, we prepare temperature (T)-triggered superwetting transitions on a paint for controlled photodegradation. The superwetting switches can be reversibly cycled 50 times after sandpaper abrasion, knife scratch, finger wipe, and ultra-long UV irradiation. Meanwhile, UV resistance ensures long-termed coexistence of switchable superwetting and photocatalysis. As for water-based dyes (methyl blue, methyl orange), our paint shows T-regulated photodegradation. The superhydrophobic surface at 50°C possesses less-contacted catalytic sites and exhibits the lowest degradation rate (DR), 15.0%. Inversely, the highest DR of 95.5% is obtained on a 10°C-sensitive superhydrophilic surface because of the sufficiently contacted catalytic sites. This work indicates promising applications in various fields of materials science and chemistry.

Abstract: Summary
Opening the graphene zero bandgap and simultaneously keeping its linear electronic dispersion has been widely accepted as a very challenging scientific puzzle. Moreover, one of the biggest obstacles for all-perovskite tandem solar cells is the lack of perovskite semiconductors with a narrow bandgap (<1.2 eV). Here we examine these two issues and theoretically identify the environmentally friendly perovskite A2HfTe4 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba), especially Ba2HfTe4. This material is a good candidate for three-dimensional graphene-like semiconductors with two-dimensional electronic dimensionality, linear band-edge dispersion, a direct bandgap of 0.77–0.96 eV, carrier effective mass and mobility similar to graphene, visible-light absorption beyond Pb-based perovskites, and power conversion efficiency approaching ∼28%. A2HfTe4 is a promising bottom-cell material that helps achieve all-perovskite tandem solar cells thanks to its narrow bandgap and acts as a potential alternative to the currently popular perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells.

Abstract: A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease 23 (ADAM23) is a member of the ADAMs family of transmembrane proteins, mostly expressed in nervous system, and involved in traffic and stabilization of Kv1-potassium channels, synaptic transmission, neurite outgrowth, neuronal morphology and cell adhesion. Also, ADAM23 has been linked to human pathological conditions, such as epilepsy, cancer metastasis and cardiomyopathy. ADAM23 functionality depends on the molecule presence at the cell surface and along the secretory pathway, as expected for a cell surface receptor. Because endocytosis is an important functional regulatory mechanism of plasma membrane receptors and no information is available about the traffic or turnover of non-catalytic ADAMs, we investigated ADAM23 internalization, recycling and half-life properties. Here, we show that ADAM23 undergoes constitutive internalization from the plasma membrane, a process that depends on lipid raft integrity, and is redistributed to intracellular vesicles, especially early and recycling endosomes. Furthermore, we observed that ADAM23 is recycled from intracellular compartments back to the plasma membrane and thus has longer half-life and higher cell surface stability compared with other ADAMs. Our findings suggest that regulation of ADAM23 endocytosis/stability could be exploited therapeutically in diseases in which ADAM23 is directly involved, such as epilepsy, cancer progression and cardiac hypertrophy.

Abstract: Chronic disease or injury of the vasculature impairs the functionality of vascular wall cells particularly in their ability to migrate and repair vascular surfaces. Under pathologic conditions, vascular endothelial cells (ECs) lose their non-thrombogenic properties and decrease their motility. Alternatively, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) may increase motility and proliferation, leading to blood vessel luminal invasion. Current therapies to prevent subsequent blood vessel occlusion commonly mechanically injure vascular cells leading to endothelial denudation and smooth muscle cell luminal migration. Due to this dichotomous migratory behavior, a need exists for modulating vascular cell growth and migration in a more targeted manner. Here, we examine the efficacy of utilizing small direct current electric fields to influence vascular cell-specific migration (“galvanotaxis”). We designed, fabricated, and implemented an in vitro chamber for tracking vascular cell migration direction, distance, and displacement under galvanotactic influence of varying magnitude. Our results indicate that vascular ECs and SMCs have differing responses to galvanotaxis; ECs exhibit a positive correlation of anodal migration while SMCs exhibit minimal change in directional migration in relation to the electric field direction. SMCs exhibit less motility response (i.e. distance traveled in 4 h) compared to ECs, but SMCs show a significantly higher motility at low electric potentials (80 mV/cm). With further investigation and translation, galvanotaxis may be an effective solution for modulation of vascular cell-specific migration, leading to enhanced endothelialization, with coordinate reduced smooth muscle in-migration.

Abstract: Summary
Lentiviral vectors (LVs) commonly used for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies often have low titers and sub-optimal gene transfer efficiency for human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), hindering clinical translation and commercialization for ex vivo gene therapy. We observed that a high percentage of β-globin LV viral genomic RNAs were incomplete toward the 3′ end in packaging cells and in released vector particles. The incomplete vector genomes impeded reverse transcription in target cells, limiting stable gene transfer to HSPCs. By combining three modifications to vector design and production (shortening the vector length to 5.3 kb; expressing HIV-1 Tat protein during packaging; and packaging in PKR−/− cells) there was a 30-fold increase in vector titer and a 3-fold increase in vector infectivity in HSPCs. These approaches may improve the manufacturing of β-globin and other complex LVs for enhanced gene delivery and may facilitate clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
Adult neurogenesis is impaired in the hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) as well as AD models. However, it is far from clear how modulating adult neurogenesis affects AD neuropathology. We confirm that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is impaired in two AD models. Surprisingly, however, cognitive functions are improved in AD models after ablating adult neural stem cells (aNSCs). Ablation of aNSCs does not affect the levels of amyloid β but restores the normal synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells of AD models. Furthermore, calbindin depletion in the DG of AD mice is ameliorated after aNSC ablation, and knocking down calbindin abolishes the effects of aNSC ablation on synaptic and cognitive functions of AD mice. Together, our data suggest that cognitive functions of AD mice are improved after aNSC ablation, which is associated with the restoration of synaptic transmission in the DG granule cells with calbindin as an important mediator.

Abstract: Summary
The characterization of the chemistry of life on earth has been facilitated by developments in analysis and sequencing of bio-oligomers using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Bio-oligomers can be identified with sequence-level resolution in analytes more complex than any synthetic mixture, enabled by well-established knowledge of fragmentation properties and extensive MS/MS databases built up over decades. However, unknown oligomer systems remain difficult to characterize, as no comparable databases exist, partly because of the vast chemical diversity and fragmentation pathways. Here, we present oligomer-soup-sequencing (OLIGOSS), a new approach to the sequencing of unknown oligomer systems. Using a novel set of backbone-agnostic abstract properties to define fragmentation, OLIGOSS is capable of sequencing any linear oligomer class amenable to MS/MS, regardless of backbone chemistry. We validated OLIGOSS by sequencing synthetic peptides, polyesters, polyimines and depsipeptide oligomers, mapped RNA methylation sites, and a ribosomally synthesized peptide, thioholgamide, directly from a cell lysate without purification.

Abstract: Summary
Tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) technology has attracted much attention in the crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) community due to overwhelming advantages for device efficiency and cost. However, fundamental device physics of the core structure of TOPCon (i.e., the polycrystalline silicon [poly-Si]/silicon oxide [SiOx]/c-Si junction), are not yet fully understood. Here, we conduct extensive experiments and simulations to clarify the underlying dynamics of the junction featuring local pinholes, including pinhole formation processes and charge-carrier transport mechanisms. The pinhole formation process is investigated by following the film dynamics, which suggest that stress due to thermal expansion is probably responsible for SiOx film fracture. The carrier transport mechanism of the poly-Si/SiOx/Si junction is numerically investigated, revealing that tunneling charge-carrier transport couples with direct transport through pinholes. Moreover, a detailed current-recombination analysis in conjunction with predictions of device efficiencies is demonstrated, providing a specific technical route to promote device efficiencies to 27%.

Abstract: Summary
Developing high-voltage cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is both challenging and extremely urgent. Here, we report an abnormal high-voltage Na2/3Ni1/3Sn2/3O2 cathode material with a P2-structure stoichiometric composition and an O3-type layered phase. Using a classic P2-type layered oxide cathode Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 as a model system, we demonstrate the accurate manipulation of orbital hybridization between transition metal and oxygen atoms to regulate the redox potential through engineering the chemical composition and corresponding electronic structure. Meanwhile, an in-depth systematic investigation of dynamic structural evolution during the formation process and highly reversible O3–P3 phase transition as well as charge compensation mechanism throughout Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process is clearly demonstrated through various in situ techniques. Overall, this study not only reveals intrinsic chemical and structural properties, adjustable electrochemical behavior, and dynamic evolution process, but also explores an orbital-level understanding of controllable redox potential for high-voltage SIBs.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining a high working frequency is one of the critical technical solutions to the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for improving its output power. Herein, we propose a bearing structural TENG (BS-TENG), which achieves a speed of nearly 1,500 rpm based on the diversified design of 3D printing. It is vital that a BS-TENG unit delivers a peak power of 0.96 mW under an external load of 8 MΩ and, in addition, charges a capacitor of 1,000 μF to reach a voltage of 4 V that takes merely 80 s at a rotational speed of 600 rpm. The integrated BS-TENG network serves as both an energy harvester and a self-powered high-speed sensing system for the safe operation of vehicles. This study presents an approach for upgrading the working frequency of TENGs and may provide new opportunities for TENGs in intelligent automobile driving systems.

Abstract: Summary
The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has devastated the global economy and claimed more than 1.7 million lives, presenting an urgent global health crisis. To identify host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, we designed a focused high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 332 members of a recently published SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We leveraged the compact nature of this library to systematically screen SARS-CoV-2 at two physiologically relevant temperatures along with three related coronaviruses (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E], HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution than genome-scale studies. This approach yielded several insights, including potential virus-specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, as well as identification of multiple pan-coronavirus factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. This coronavirus essentiality catalog could inform ongoing drug development efforts aimed at intercepting and treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and help prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks.

Abstract: Summary
The emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses through evolution of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) poses a significant obstacle to polio eradication. Understanding the early genetic changes that occur as OPV evolves and transmits is important for preventing future outbreaks. Here, we use deep sequencing to define the evolutionary trajectories of type 2 OPV in a vaccine trial. By sequencing 497 longitudinal stool samples from 271 OPV2 recipients and household contacts, we were able to examine the extent of convergent evolution in vaccinated individuals and the amount of viral diversity that is transmitted. In addition to rapid reversion of key attenuating mutations, we identify strong selection at 19 sites across the genome. We find that a tight transmission bottleneck limits the onward transmission of these early adaptive mutations. Our results highlight the distinct evolutionary dynamics of live attenuated virus vaccines and have important implications for the success of next-generation OPV.

Abstract: Summary
The construction of efficient noble-metal-free systems for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction still remains a key challenge. Here, we report an efficient molecular hybrid system composed of a Co-PYN5 catalyst that contains a pyrene functionality that anchors on g-C3N4 dye surface via CH-π interactions. This hybrid material achieves high turnover numbers (TONs) and turnover frequencies (TOFs) for visible light reduction of CO2 to CO of 533 and 95 h−1 that are within the best reported up to now. The improved performance is rationalized in terms of the electronic coupling that takes place with the π system of the pyrene group with both the g-C3N4 surface and the Co-pyridyl moiety of the catalysts.

Abstract: Summary
Nowadays, the best lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells are primarily demonstrated in the n-p structure, while the p-n structure is significantly less developed. This technological gap between the n-p and p-n structures is much more distinct than in cases of other solution-processable photovoltaic technologies like perovskites and polymers. Here, we propose a scalable fabrication strategy for efficient PbS QD solar cells with p-n structure. An industrially suited blade-coating technique has been used to deposit both n-type and p-type QD layers. The obtained solar cells demonstrated power conversion efficiency of 9%, thus, commensurate to the record device efficiency with this architecture fabricated with a non-scalable technique. The availability of both p-n and n-p structures fabricated from scalable methods may promote the future integration of the PbS QDs into tandem devices together with other solution-processable materials to exploit the most prominent benefits of the PbS QDs, such as infrared absorption.

Abstract: Summary
Castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPCs) lose sensitivity to androgen-deprivation therapies but frequently remain dependent on oncogenic transcription driven by the androgen receptor (AR) and its splice variants. To discover modulators of AR-variant activity, we used a lysate-based small-molecule microarray assay and identified KI-ARv-03 as an AR-variant complex binder that reduces AR-driven transcription and proliferation in prostate cancer cells. We deduced KI-ARv-03 to be a potent, selective inhibitor of CDK9, an important cofactor for AR, MYC, and other oncogenic transcription factors. Further optimization resulted in KB-0742, an orally bioavailable, selective CDK9 inhibitor with potent anti-tumor activity in CRPC models. In 22Rv1 cells, KB-0742 rapidly downregulates nascent transcription, preferentially depleting short half-life transcripts and AR-driven oncogenic programs. In vivo, oral administration of KB-0742 significantly reduced tumor growth in CRPC, supporting CDK9 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy to target AR dependence in CRPC.

Src-mediated Tyr353 phosphorylation of IP3R1 promotes its stability and causes apoptosis in palmitic acid-treated hepatocytes,

Abstract: Palmitic acid (PA)-induced hepatocyte apoptosis is critical for the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1) is an intracellular Ca2+-release channel and is involved in PA-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. While the expression of IP3R1 is elevated in patients with NAFLD and in hepatocytes treated with PA, it remains unclear how PA promotes the expression of IP3R1. In present study, our results showed that PA induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, which is accompanied with the increase of the IP3R1 expression in hepatic cells. The inhibition of IP3R1 expression using siRNA ameliorated the PA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, PA enhanced the stability of the IP3R1 protein instead of an increase in its mRNA levels. PA also promoted the phosphorylation of IP3R1 at the Tyr353 site and increased the phosphorylation of src in hepatic cells. Moreover, an inhibitor of src kinase (SU6656) significantly reduced the Tyr353 phosphorylation of IP3R1 and decreased its stability. In addition, SU6656 improved mitochondrial function and reduced apoptosis in hepatocytes. Conclusion: PA promotes the Tyr353 phosphorylation of IP3R1 by activating the src pathway and increasing the protein stability of IP3R1, which consequently results in mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatic cells. Our results also suggested that inhibition of the src/IP3R1 pathway, such as by SU6656, may be a novel potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of NAFLD.

Abstract: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), which are found in the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors, not only mediate cancer immune evasion but also promote tumor growth. The transcription factor NF-κB, which is a crucial link between inflammation and tumors, can accelerate tumor occurrence and development. NEMO, the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, plays a pivotal role in activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. However, the function of myeloid NEMO in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. Here, we found that conditional knockout of NEMO in myeloid cells promoted tumor growth in a transplanted cancer mouse model. In Nemofl/fl lyz-cre+/- mice, the deletion of Nemo in myeloid cells increased the recruitment of M2 macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into the tumor, reduced the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, and upregulated the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR2, thereby promoting tumor growth in vivo. Then, we showed that blocking the MCP1-CCR2 pathway could inhibit tumor growth, especially in mice with myeloid NEMO deletion. In this study, we examined the mechanism of NEMO in myeloid cells and explored the role of NEMO in the prevention and treatment of cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian embryogenesis is a paradigm of regulative development as mouse embryos show plasticity in the regulation of cell fate, cell number, and tissue morphogenesis. However, the mechanisms behind embryo plasticity remain largely unknown. Here, we determine how mouse embryos respond to an increase in cell numbers to regulate the timing and mechanism of embryonic morphogenesis, leading to the formation of the pro-amniotic cavity. Using embryos and embryonic stem cell aggregates of different size, we show that while pro-amniotic cavity formation in normal-sized embryos is achieved through basement membrane-induced polarization and exocytosis, cavity formation of increased-size embryos is delayed and achieved through apoptosis of cells that lack contact with the basement membrane. Importantly, blocking apoptosis, both genetically and pharmacologically, alters pro-amniotic cavity formation but does not affect size regulation in enlarged embryos. We conclude that the regulation of embryonic size and morphogenesis, albeit concomitant, have distinct molecular underpinnings.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular oxygen (O2) activation is a critical step in the low-temperature catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO). Photocatalysis is a facile way to activate O2 to superoxide radicals under mild conditions. Photothermal catalysis, which integrates the photocatalysis of semiconductors and the thermocatalysis of noble metals, has arisen as an appealing strategy to achieve low-temperature catalytic oxidation. Here, we report that Pd/PdO/CeO2 shows that the temperature of 90% CO conversion dropped by 30°C–50°C under irradiation. The apparent activation energy reduces from 64.6 kJ ⋅ mol−1 to 44.6 kJ ⋅ mol−1. Pd/PdO/TiO2 and Pd/PdO/Al2O3 are prepared and compared to understand the underlying mechanism. The results reveal that photocatalysis is vital in lowering the apparent activation energy besides the photothermal effect. The photo-generated electrons promote O2 activation to generate the superoxide anion. The hole can activate the adsorbed CO on the PdO. These active species are beneficial for lowering the CO oxidation temperature.

Abstract: Summary
Postnatal host-microbiota interplay governs mucosal homeostasis and is considered to have life-long health consequences. The intestine monolayer epithelium is critically involved in such early-life processes; nevertheless, the role of the oral multilayer epithelium remains ill defined. We demonstrate that unlike the intestine, the neonate oral cavity is immensely colonized by the microbiota that decline to adult levels during weaning. Neutrophils are present in the oral epithelium prenatally, and exposure to the microbiota postnatally further recruits them to the preamble neonatal epithelium by γδT17 cells. These neutrophils virtually disappear during weaning as the epithelium seals. The neonate and adult epithelium display distinct turnover kinetics and transcriptomic signatures, with neonate epithelium reminiscent of the signature found in germ-free mice. Microbial reduction during weaning is mediated by the upregulation of saliva production and induction of salivary antimicrobial components by the microbiota. Collectively, unique postnatal interactions between the multilayer epithelium and microbiota shape oral homeostasis.

Abstract: Neurite outgrowth is the basis for wiring during the development of the nervous system. Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) has been recognized as a promising treatment to improve behavioral, neurological and cognitive outcomes in ischemic stroke. However, little is known about the effect and mechanism of NBP on the neurite outgrowth. In this study, we used different methods to investigate the potential effects of NBP on the neurite extension and plasticity of immature and mature primary cortical neurons and explored the underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that in immature and mature cortical neurons, NBP promoted the neurite length and intersections, increased neuritic arborization, elevated numbers of neurite branch and terminal points and improved neurite complexity and plasticity of neuronal development processes. Besides, our data revealed that NBP promoted neurite extension and branching partly by activating Shh signaling pathway via increasing Gap43 expression both in immature and mature primary cortical neurons. The present study provided new insights into the contribution of NBP in neuronal plasticity and unveiled a novel pathway to induce Gap43 expression in primary cortical neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Sorption-based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is recognized as a feasible and sustainable approach to address global water scarcity in arid regions. However, easy-to-prepare and inexpensive salt-based sorbents have stringent requirements referring to sorption duration and environmental humidity; otherwise, the leakage of salt solution can occur. Here, we develop a composite sorbent with remarkably high salt content of 80 wt % and without the risk of leakage by introducing a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane encapsulation method. The developed composite HSCC-E10 shows both fast sorption kinetics inherent to the matrix of composites and high absorption capacity of hygroscopic salt solutions, achieving ultra-high sorption capacity of 3.75 g/g, 2.83 g/g, and 1.47 g/g for 90%, 70%, and 30% relative humidity (RH), respectively. A lab-scale device is developed demonstrating 560 mL/m2 water yield under outdoor natural sunlight. The applicability of proposed sorbents could pave the road for future middle- or large-scale applications, such as vehicle-mounted and continuous SAWH.

Abstract: Summary
SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa) is a prototypical intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that is unstructured by itself but forms coiled-coil helices in the SNARE complex. With high conformational heterogeneity, detailed structural dynamics of unbound SNAP-25 remain elusive. Here, we report an integrative method to probe the structural dynamics of SNAP-25 by combining replica-exchange discrete molecular dynamics (rxDMD) simulations and label-based experiments at ensemble and single-molecule levels. The rxDMD simulations systematically characterize the coil-to-molten globular transition and reconstruct structural ensemble consistent with prior ensemble experiments. Label-based experiments using Förster resonance energy transfer and double electron-electron resonance further probe the conformational dynamics of SNAP-25. Agreements between simulations and experiments under both ensemble and single-molecule conditions allow us to assign specific helix-coil transitions in SNAP-25 that occur in submillisecond timescales and potentially play a vital role in forming the SNARE complex. We expect that this integrative approach may help further our understanding of IDPs.

Abstract: Summary
Phase transformation from layered double hydroxides (LDHs) into mixed metal oxides (MMOs) has been widely used in various catalytic applications owing to its numerous advantages over conventional synthesis methods. Herein we report the results of selective phase transformation of LDHs into spinels and delafossites for the preparation of phase-pure MMO catalysts. Pure cuprous delafossites and cupric spinels were selectively obtained through heat treatment of Cu-based LDHs followed by post-treatments. This enabled the study of the crystalline-phase-dependent CO oxidation activity of the MMO catalysts and their physicochemical properties. The spinel catalysts exhibited higher CO oxidation activities, in comparison with those of the delafossites, with greater redox properties and improved active sites for CO adsorption. Although the crystalline phases were derived from the same LDH precursors, the catalytic properties of the end product were greatly influenced by their crystal structures.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor suppressor genes represent a major class of oncogenic drivers. However, direct targeting of loss-of-function tumor suppressors remains challenging. To address this gap, we explored a variant-directed chemical biology approach to reverse the lost function of tumor suppressors using SMAD4 as an example. SMAD4, a central mediator of the TGF-β pathway, is recurrently mutated in many tumors. Here, we report the development of a TR-FRET technology that recapitulated the dynamic differential interaction of SMAD4 and SMAD4R361H with SMAD3 and identified Ro-31-8220, a bisindolylmaleimide derivative, as a SMAD4R361H/SMAD3 interaction inducer. Ro-31-8220 reactivated the dormant SMAD4R361H-mediated transcriptional activity and restored TGF-β-induced tumor suppression activity in SMAD4 mutant cancer cells. Thus, demonstration of Ro-31-8220 as a SMAD4R361H/SMAD3 interaction inducer illustrates a general strategy to reverse the lost function of tumor suppressors with hypomorph mutations and supports a systematic approach to develop small-molecule protein-protein interaction (PPI) molecular glues for biological insights and therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Summary
Solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is regarded as the most important but the least understood part of lithium (Li)-ion batteries. A comprehensive understanding of the nature of the SEI and especially its interplay with active materials during cycling is crucial since it governs the charge transfer and Li+ transport. Herein, the dynamic interplay between SEI and silicon (Si) anode during cycling is revealed quantitatively and qualitatively by titration gas chromatography (TGC), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), and other techniques to probe charge transfer, nanostructure, and equilibrium. The results show that it is difficult to construct an equilibrium interplay between the SEI and LixSi due to the intrinsic instability of some SEI components (e.g., Li2O and carbonates) and the pulverization of Si anode, resulting in the continuous formation of the SEI and inactive LixSi. The addition of fluoroethylene carbonate helps construct such equilibrium interplay through formation of a LiF-rich SEI, thus improving cyclability.

Abstract: Osteoclasts seeded on either glass coverslips or apatite pellets have at least two morphologically distinct substrate adhesion sites: actin-based adhesion structures including podosome belts and sealing zones, and adjacent clathrin sheets. Clathrin-coated structures are exclusively localized at the podosome belts and sealing zone, in both of which the plasma membrane forms a tight attachment to the substrate surface. When cultured on apatite osteoclasts can degrade the apatite leading to the formation of resorption lacunae. The sealing zone divides the ventral membrane into different domains, outside and inside of the sealing zones. The former facing the smooth-surfaced intact apatite contains relatively solitary or networks of larger flat clathrin structures; and the latter, facing the rough-surfaced degraded apatite in the resorption lacunae contain clathrin in various shapes and sizes. Clathrin assemblies on the membrane domain facing not only a resorption lacuna, or trails but also intact apatite indeed were observed to be heterogeneous in size and intensity, suggesting that they appeared to follow variations in the surface topography of the apatite surface. These results provide a detailed insight into the flat clathrin sheets that have been suggested to be the sites of adhesion and mechanosensing in co-operation with podosomes.

Abstract: Background
Equipoise exists regarding sickle cell disease (SCD) as a risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity and variables that increase risk of COVID-19 severity in SCD. Given our health system's large SCD patient catchment, we analyzed our own experience in this regard.
Study methods
Retrospective analysis of the clinical course and factors associated with need for hospitalization and ICU admission of SCD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 through the Northwell Health system from March 1 to Dec 31, 2020.
Results
Of 1098 patients with SCD, 3.3% were diagnosed with COVID-19. Overall rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, cohort mortality, and in-hospital mortality were 80%, 19%, 2.5%,and 3.1%, respectively. By multivariable analysis, hospitalization risk was decreased by 60% for every 1 g/dL increase in admission Hb. ICU admission risk was increased by 84% as a health care worker; increased by 45% for every 1000/uL increase in admission immature granulocyte count; and decreased by 17% with hydroxyurea use.
Discussion
High hospitalization rates are compatible with worsened severity upon COVID-19 infection in SCD compared to the general population. Patients should be placed on hydroxyurea to increase their Hb and perhaps lower their neutrophil counts. Health care workers with SCD may warrant special safety precautions.

Abstract: Mitochondria play an important role in effective cell energy production and cell survival under stress conditions, such as treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. Mitochondrial biogenesis is increased in ovarian cancer tissues, which is accompanied by alteration of mitochondrial energy metabolism, structure, and dynamics. These factors are involved in tumorigenesis and apoptosis resistance, highlighting the role of mitochondria in resisting cisplatin toxicity. Cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells are dependent on mitochondrial OXPHOS for energy supply, and intracellular PGC1α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis levels are increased in this cell line, indicating the important role of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in cisplatin resistance. As PGC1α is a key molecule for integrating and coordinating nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA transcriptional machinery, an investigation into the regulatory mechanism PGC1α in mitochondrial energy metabolism via transcription may provide new clues for solving chemotherapy resistance. In the present study, it was demonstrated that inhibiting the expression of PGC1α decreased nuclear and mitochondrial DNA transcription factor expression, leading to increased lactic acid production and decreased cellular oxygen consumption and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, mitochondrial stress-induced ROS production, as a feedback signal from mitochondria to the cell nucleus, increased PGC1α expression in SKOV3/DDP cells, which was involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation regulation. Collectively, the present study provides evidence that PGC1α-mediated nuclear and mitochondrial transcription feedback regulates energy metabolism and is involved in ovarian cancer cells escaping apoptosis during cisplatin treatment.

Abstract: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is associated with fungal keratitis. This work aims to investigate whether TSLP can regulate T helper (Th) 17 and regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. We separated dendritic cells (DCs) from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. DCs were treated with TSLP to activate DCs, and exosomes were obtained. CD+ T cells were incubated with exosomes from TSLP-treated DCs. We found that exosomes from TSLP-treated DCs notably promoted the proportions of Th17 cells and inhibited the proportions of Tregs in the CD4+ T cells. Moreover, exosomes from TSLP-treated DCs enhanced the expression of retinoid-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) and interleukin 17 (IL-17), and repressed the expression of forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in the CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, miR-21 was highly expressed in exosomes from TSLP-treated DCs. Exosomes from TSLP-treated miR-21-silenced DCs promoted Treg differentiation and suppressed Th17 differentiation. Smad7 up-regulation repressed Th17 differentiation and enhanced Treg differentiation, which was abolished by miR-21 overexpression. Smad7 overexpression rescued the effect of exosomes from TSLP-treated DCs on Th17/Treg differentiation. In conclusion, our article confirms that TSLP induces DCs to deliver miR-21 by secreting exosomes, and thus miR-21 regulates Th17/Treg differentiation by inhibiting Smad7. Thus, this work further reveals the biological role of miR-21 in fungal keratitis.

Abstract: Melanoma is characterized by high mortality and poor prognosis due to metastasis. AFF4 (AF4/FMR2 family member 4), as a scaffold protein, is a component of the super elongation complex (SEC), and is involved in the progression of tumors, e.g., leukemia, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, few studies on AFF4 have focused on melanoma. Here, AFF4 expression levels and clinicopathological features were evaluated in melanoma tissue samples. Then, we performed cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays in A375 and A2058 cells lines in vitro to evaluate the role of AFF4 in melanoma. The effects of AFF4 knockdown in vivo were characterized via a xenograft mouse model. Finally, the correlation between c-Jun and AFF4 protein levels in melanoma was analyzed by rescue assay and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We found that AFF4 expression was upregulated in melanoma tumor tissues and that AFF4 protein expression was also closely related to the prognosis of patients with cutaneous melanoma. Moreover, AFF4 could promote the invasion and migration of melanoma cells by mediating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). AFF4 might regulate c-Jun activity to promote the invasion and migration of melanoma cells. Importantly, c-Jun was regulated by the AFF4 promoted melanoma tumorigenesis in vivo. Taken together, AFF4 may be a novel oncogene that promotes melanoma progression through regulation of c-Jun activity.

Abstract: Summary
2-Aminovinyl-cysteine (AviCys) is a thioether amino acid shared by a variety of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Based on investigations into the biosynthesis of thioviridamide RiPPs in Streptomyces sp. NRRL S-87, we here report a path for the formation of this unusual thioether residue. This path relies on four dedicated proteins: phosphotransferase TvaCS-87, Lyase TvaDS-87, kinase homolog TvaES-87, and LanD-like flavoprotein TvaFS-87. TvaES-87 plays a critical role in effective AviCys formation. During the posttranslational modifications of the precursor peptide, it works with TvaFS-87 to form a minimum AviCys synthetase complex, which follows the combined activity of TvaCDS-87 for Thr dehydration and catalyzes Cys oxidative decarboxylation and subsequent Michael addition of the resulting enethiol nucleophile onto the newly formed dehydroamino acid residue for cyclization. With TvaES-87, TvaFS-87 activity for Cys processing can be coordinated with TvaCDS-87 activity for minimizing competitive or unexpected spontaneous reactions and forming AviCys effectively.

Abstract: Summary
Asymmetric catalysis enabling divergent control of multiple stereocenters remains challenging in synthetic organic chemistry. Although machine-learning-based optimization of molecular catalysis is a rapidly growing research field, the use of such approaches for catalyst design to achieve stereodivergent asymmetric synthesis producing multiple reaction outcomes, such as constitutional selectivity, diastereoselectivity, and enantioselectivity, is unprecedented. Here, we report the straightforward identification of asymmetric two-component iridium/boron hybrid catalyst systems for α-C-allylation of carboxylic acids. Structural optimization of the chiral ligands for iridium catalysts was driven by molecular-field-based regression analysis with a dataset containing overall 32 molecular structures. The catalyst systems enabled selective access to all the possible isomers of chiral carboxylic acids bearing contiguous stereocenters. This chemoselective and stereodivergent, asymmetric catalysis is applicable to late-stage structural modifications of drugs and their derivatives.

Abstract: Summary
Streptococcus pneumoniae is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes invasive diseases, including pneumonia, with greater health risks upon influenza A virus (IAV) co-infection. To facilitate pathogenesis studies in vivo, we developed an inducible CRISPR interference system that enables genome-wide fitness testing in one sequencing step (CRISPRi-seq). We applied CRISPRi-seq to assess bottlenecks and identify pneumococcal genes important in a murine pneumonia model. A critical bottleneck occurs at 48 h with few bacteria causing systemic infection. This bottleneck is not present during IAV superinfection, facilitating identification of pneumococcal pathogenesis-related genes. Top in vivo essential genes included purA, encoding adenylsuccinate synthetase, and the cps operon required for capsule production. Surprisingly, CRISPRi-seq indicated no fitness-related role for pneumolysin during superinfection. Interestingly, although metK (encoding S-adenosylmethionine synthetase) was essential in vitro, it was dispensable in vivo. This highlights advantages of CRISPRi-seq over transposon-based genetic screens, as all genes, including essential genes, can be tested for pathogenesis potential.

Abstract: Summary
Neuropeptides and peptide hormones are important cell-cell signaling molecules that mediate many physiological processes. Unlike classic neurotransmitters, peptides undergo cell-type-specific post-translational modifications that affect their biological activity. To enable the identification of the peptide repertoire of a genetically defined cell type, we generated mice with a conditional disruption of the gene for carboxypeptidase E (Cpe), an essential neuropeptide-processing enzyme. The loss of Cpe leads to accumulation of neuropeptide precursors containing C-terminal basic residues, which serve as tags for affinity purification. The purified peptides are subsequently identified using quantitative peptidomics, thereby revealing the specific forms of neuropeptides in cells with the disrupted Cpe gene. To validate the method, we used mice expressing Cre recombinase under the proopiomelanocortin (Pomc) promoter and analyzed hypothalamic and pituitary extracts, detecting peptides derived from proopiomelanocortin (as expected) and also proSAAS in POMC neurons. This technique enables the analyses of specific forms of peptides in any Cre-expressing cell type.

Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T cells) are a new modality of oncological treatment which has demonstrated impressive response in refractory or relapsed diseases, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphomas, and myeloma but is also associated with unique and potentially life-threatening toxicities. The most common adverse events (AEs) include cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurological toxicities, such as the immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), cytopenias, infections, and hypogammaglobulinemia. These may be severe and require admission of the patient to an intensive care unit. However, these AEs are manageable when recognized early and treated by a duly trained team. The objective of this article is to report a consensus compiled by specialists in the fields of oncohematology, bone marrow transplantation, and cellular therapy describing recommendations on the Clinical Centers preparation, training of teams that will use CAR-T cells, and leading clinical questions as to their use and the management of potential complications.

Abstract: Many studies suggest that Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG) has many protective effects. But little is known about its protective effects against chronic restraint stress-induced damage in rats. The aim was to demonstrate the potential protective effects of EGCG against harmful pancreatic damage to the immobilization stress in the rat model. Forty rats, 2 months old, were divided into four groups (n = 10): control group; EGCG group, rats received EGCG by gavage (100 mg/kg /day) for 30 days; stressed group, rats exposed to immobilization stress; and stressed with EGCG group, rats exposed to immobilization stress and received EGCG for 30 days. Glycemic status parameters, corticosterone, and inflammatory markers were investigated on the first day, 15th day, and the 30th day of the experiment. Pancreatic oxidative stress markers and cytokines were evaluated. Histological, immunohistological, and statistical studies were performed. On the 15th day, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and fasting plasma corticosterone were significantly higher in the stressed group when compared with first and 30th day in the same group as well as when compared with control and stressed with EGCG groups. The stressed group revealed significantly higher pancreatic IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, and NO, serum amylase and serum lipase, and significantly lower GSH, SOD, and CAT when compared to control and stressed with EGCG groups. EGCG treatment attenuated the pancreatic stress-induced cellular degeneration, leucocytic infiltration, and cytoplasmic vacuolations; significantly decreased area percentage of collagen fibers; and significantly increased mean area percentage of insulin immunopositive cell as compared with stressed group. EGCG is a protective agent against immobilization stress because of its anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and and anti-oxidative stress properties, as confirmed by biochemical and histological alterations.

Abstract: Summary
Tetrasubstituted all-carbon olefins and 1,3-diene derivatives play a key role in various fields. The application of phosphine-containing compounds covers a wide ground as well. Despite the importance of phosphine-containing tetrasubstituted acyclic unsymmetrical all-carbon olefins, no general method exists for the construction of them stereoselectively. Herein, we present a strategy that constructs such compounds along with 1,3-diene motifs in the presence of palladium catalysis via three-component reaction. In addition, downstream transformations upon reduction indicated that these products are potential novel ligands. This is a ligand-free process that features broad substrate scope and various functional group tolerance with excellent stereoselectivity; of note, the substrates incorporating complex molecules or pharmaceuticals can also proceed smoothly in our protocol.
