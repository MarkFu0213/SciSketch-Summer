Abstract: Summary
Cell lines are important tools for biological and preclinical investigation, and establishing their relationship to genomic alterations in tumors could accelerate functional and therapeutic discoveries. We conducted integrated analyses of genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 15 human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative and 11 HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) lines to compare with 279 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified recurrent amplifications on chromosomes 3q22–29, 5p15, 11q13/22, and 8p11 that drive increased expression of more than 100 genes in cell lines and tumors. These alterations, together with loss or mutations of tumor suppressor genes, converge on important signaling pathways, recapitulating the genomic landscape of aggressive HNSCCs. Among these, concurrent 3q26.3 amplification and TP53 mutation in most HPV(–) cell lines reflect tumors with worse survival. Our findings elucidate and validate genomic alterations underpinning numerous discoveries made with HNSCC lines and provide valuable models for future studies.

Abstract: Summary
Protein degradation is known to be a key component of expression regulation for individual genes, but its global impact on gene expression has been difficult to determine. We analyzed a parallel gene expression dataset of yeast meiotic differentiation, identifying instances of coordinated protein-level decreases to identify new cases of regulated meiotic protein degradation, including of ribosomes and targets of the meiosis-specific anaphase-promoting complex adaptor Ama1. Comparison of protein and translation measurements over time also revealed that, although meiotic cells are capable of synthesizing protein complex members at precisely matched levels, they typically do not. Instead, the members of most protein complexes are synthesized imprecisely, but their protein levels are matched, indicating that wild-type eukaryotic cells routinely use post-translational adjustment of protein complex partner levels to achieve proper stoichiometry. Outlier cases, in which specific complex components show divergent protein-level trends, suggest timed regulation of these complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Human multipotent stromal cells (hMSCs) are one of the most versatile cell types used in regenerative medicine due to their ability to respond to injury. In the context of diabetes, it has been previously shown that the regenerative capacity of hMSCs is donor specific after transplantation into streptozotocin (STZ)-treated immunodeficient mice. However, in vivo transplantation models to determine regenerative potency of hMSCs are lengthy, costly, and low throughput. Therefore, a high-throughput quantitative proteomics assay was developed to screen β cell regenerative potency of donor-derived hMSC lines. Using proteomics, we identified 16 proteins within hMSC conditioned media that effectively identify β cell regenerative hMSCs. This protein signature was validated using human islet culture assay, ELISA, and the potency was confirmed by recovery of hyperglycemia in STZ-treated mice. Herein, we demonstrated that quantitative proteomics can determine sample-specific protein signatures that can be used to classify previously uncharacterized hMSC lines for β cell regenerative clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
RORγt is well recognized as the lineage-defining transcription factor for T helper 17 (TH17) cell development. However, the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that negatively regulate TH17 cell development and autoimmunity remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the transcriptional repressor REV-ERBα is exclusively expressed in TH17 cells, competes with RORγt for their shared DNA consensus sequence, and negatively regulates TH17 cell development via repression of genes traditionally characterized as RORγt dependent, including Il17a. Deletion of REV-ERBα enhanced TH17-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, exacerbating experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and colitis. Treatment with REV-ERB-specific synthetic ligands, which have similar phenotypic properties as RORγ modulators, suppressed TH17 cell development, was effective in colitis intervention studies, and significantly decreased the onset, severity, and relapse rate in several models of EAE without affecting thymic cellularity. Our results establish that REV-ERBα negatively regulates pro-inflammatory TH17 responses in vivo and identifies the REV-ERBs as potential targets for the treatment of TH17-mediated autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
How mutations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) cause Alexander disease (AxD) remains elusive. We generated iPSCs from two AxD patients and corrected the GFAP mutations to examine the effects of mutant GFAP on human astrocytes. AxD astrocytes displayed GFAP aggregates, recapitulating the pathological hallmark of AxD. RNA sequencing implicated the endoplasmic reticulum, vesicle regulation, and cellular metabolism. Corroborating this analysis, we observed enlarged and heterogeneous morphology coupled with perinuclear localization of endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes in AxD astrocytes. Functionally, AxD astrocytes showed impaired extracellular ATP release, which is responsible for attenuated calcium wave propagation. These results reveal that AxD-causing mutations in GFAP disrupt intracellular vesicle regulation and impair astrocyte secretion, resulting in astrocyte dysfunction and AxD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The aberrant expression of squamous lineage markers in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has been correlated with poor clinical outcomes. However, the functional role of this putative transdifferentiation event in PDA pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that expression of the transcription factor TP63 (ΔNp63) is sufficient to install and sustain the enhancer landscape and transcriptional signature of the squamous lineage in human PDA cells. We also demonstrate that TP63-driven enhancer reprogramming promotes aggressive tumor phenotypes, including enhanced cell motility and invasion, and an accelerated growth of primary PDA tumors and metastases in vivo. This process ultimately leads to a powerful addiction of squamous PDA cells to continuous TP63 expression. Our study demonstrates the functional significance of squamous transdifferentiation in PDA and reveals TP63-based reprogramming as an experimental tool for investigating mechanisms and vulnerabilities linked to this aberrant cell fate transition.

Abstract: Summary
During acute myelosuppression or thrombocytopenia, bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic cells respond rapidly to replenish peripheral blood platelets. While the cytokine thrombopoietin (Thpo) both regulates platelet production and maintains HSC potential, whether Thpo controls megakaryocyte (Mk)-lineage differentiation of HSCs is unclear. Here, we show that Thpo rapidly upregulates mitochondrial activity in HSCs, an activity accompanied by differentiation to an Mk lineage. Moreover, in unperturbed hematopoiesis, HSCs with high mitochondrial activity exhibit Mk-lineage differentiation in vitro and myeloid lineage-biased reconstitution in vivo. Furthermore, Thpo skewed HSCs to express the tetraspanin CD9, a pattern correlated with mitochondrial activity. Mitochondria-active HSCs are resistant to apoptosis and oxidative stress upon Thpo stimulation. Thpo-regulated mitochondrial activity associated with mitochondrial translocation of STAT3 phosphorylated at serine 727. Overall, we report an important role for Thpo in regulating rapid Mk-lineage commitment. Thpo-dependent changes in mitochondrial metabolism prime HSCs to undergo direct differentiation to an Mk lineage.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular heterogeneity within the mammalian brain poses a challenge toward understanding its complex functions. Within the olfactory bulb, odor information is processed by subtypes of inhibitory interneurons whose heterogeneity and functionality are influenced by ongoing adult neurogenesis. To investigate this cellular heterogeneity and better understand adult-born neuron development, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing and computational modeling to reveal diverse and transcriptionally distinct neuronal and nonneuronal cell types. We also analyzed molecular changes during adult-born interneuron maturation and uncovered developmental programs within their gene expression profiles. Finally, we identified that distinct neuronal subtypes are differentially affected by sensory experience. Together, these data provide a transcriptome-based foundation for investigating subtype-specific neuronal function in the olfactory bulb (OB), charting the molecular profiles that arise during the maturation and integration of adult-born neurons and how they dynamically change in an activity-dependent manner.

Abstract: As sessile organisms, plants have evolved to adjust their growth and development to environmental changes. It has been well documented that the crosstalk between different plant hormones plays important roles in the coordination of growth and development of the plant. Here, we describe a novel recessive mutant, mildly insensitive to ethylene (mine), which displayed insensitivity to the ethylene precursor, ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid), in the root under the dark-grown conditions. By contrast, mine roots exhibited a normal growth response to exogenous IAA (indole-3-acetic acid). Thus, it appears that the growth responses of mine to ACC and IAA resemble those of weak ethylene insensitive (wei) mutants. To understand the molecular events underlying the crosstalk between ethylene and auxin in the root, we identified the MINE locus and found that the MINE gene encodes the pyridoxine 5′-phosphate (PNP)/pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) oxidase, PDX3. Our results revealed that MINE/PDX3 likely plays a role in the conversion of the auxin precursor tryptophan to indole-3-pyruvic acid in the auxin biosynthesis pathway, in which TAA1 (TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1) and its related genes (TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED 1 and 2; TAR1 and TAR2) are involved. Considering that TAA1 and TARs belong to a subgroup of PLP (pyridoxal-5′-phosphate)-dependent enzymes, we propose that PLP produced by MINE/PDX3 acts as a cofactor in TAA1/TAR-dependent auxin biosynthesis induced by ethylene, which in turn influences the crosstalk between ethylene and auxin in the Arabidopsis root.

Abstract: Summary
Experimental large-scale screens for drug repositioning are limited by restriction to in vitro conditions and lack of applicability to real human conditions. Here, we developed an in silico screen in human in vivo conditions using a reference of single gene mutations’ non-tissue-specific “core transcriptome signatures” (CSs) of 8,476 genes generated from the TCGA database. We developed the core-signature drug-to-gene (csD2G) software to scan 3,546 drug treatment profiles against the reference signatures. csD2G significantly outperformed conventional cell line-based gene perturbation signatures and existing drug-repositioning methods in both coverage and specificity. We highlight this with 3 demonstrated applications: (1) repositioned category of psychiatric drugs to inhibit the TGF-β pathway; (2) antihypertensive calcium channel blockers predicted to activate AMPK and inhibit AKT pathways, and validated by clinical electronic medical records; and (3) 7 drugs predicted and validated to selectively target the AKT-FOXO and AMPK pathways and thus regulate worm lifespan.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial tissues, such as the skin, rely on cellular plasticity of stem cells (SCs) from different niches to restore tissue function after injury. How these molecularly and functionally diverse SC populations respond to injury remains elusive. Here, we genetically labeled Lgr5- or Lgr6-expressing cells from the hair follicle bulge and interfollicular epidermis (IFE), respectively, and monitored their individual transcriptional adaptations during wound healing using single-cell transcriptomics. Both Lgr5 and Lgr6 progeny rapidly induced a genetic wound signature that, for Lgr5 progeny, included the remodeling of receptors to permit interactions with the wound environment, a property that Lgr6 progeny possessed even before wounding. When contributing to re-epithelialization, Lgr5 progeny gradually replaced their bulge identity with an IFE identity, and this process started already before Lgr5 progeny left the bulge. Altogether, this study reveals how different SCs respond and adapt to a new environment, potentially explaining cellular plasticity of many epithelial tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Translocation moves the tRNA2⋅mRNA module directionally through the ribosome during the elongation phase of protein synthesis. Although translocation is known to entail large conformational changes within both the ribosome and tRNA substrates, the orchestrated events that ensure the speed and fidelity of this critical aspect of the protein synthesis mechanism have not been fully elucidated. Here, we present three high-resolution structures of intermediates of translocation on the mammalian ribosome where, in contrast to bacteria, ribosomal complexes containing the translocase eEF2 and the complete tRNA2⋅mRNA module are trapped by the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GMPPNP. Consistent with the observed structures, single-molecule imaging revealed that GTP hydrolysis principally facilitates rate-limiting, final steps of translocation, which are required for factor dissociation and which are differentially regulated in bacterial and mammalian systems by the rates of deacyl-tRNA dissociation from the E site.

Abstract: Summary
Protein translation in eukaryotes is cell-cycle dependent, with translation rates more robust in G1 phase of the cell cycle than in mitosis. However, whether the fundamental cell-cycle control machinery directly activates protein translation during the G1/S cell-cycle transition remains unknown. Using the early divergent eukaryote Trypanosoma brucei as a model organism, we report that the G1 cyclin-dependent kinase CRK1 phosphorylates two translation initiation factors, eIF4E4 and PABP1, to promote the G1/S cell-cycle transition and global protein translation. Phosphorylation of eIF4E4 by CRK1 enhances binding to the m7G cap structure and interaction with eIF4E4 and eIF4G3, and phosphorylation of PABP1 by CRK1 promotes association with the poly(A) sequence, self-interaction, and interaction with eIF4E4. These findings demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated regulation of translation initiation factors couples global protein translation with the G1/S cell-cycle transition.

Abstract: Summary
Complete activation of B cells relies on their capacity to extract tethered antigens from immune synapses by either exerting mechanical forces or promoting their proteolytic degradation through lysosome secretion. Whether antigen extraction can also be tuned by local cues originating from the lymphoid microenvironment has not been investigated. We here show that the expression of Galectin-8—a glycan-binding protein found in the extracellular milieu, which regulates interactions between cells and matrix proteins—is increased within lymph nodes under inflammatory conditions where it enhances B cell arrest phases upon antigen recognition in vivo and promotes synapse formation during BCR recognition of immobilized antigens. Galectin-8 triggers a faster recruitment and secretion of lysosomes toward the B cell-antigen contact site, resulting in efficient extraction of immobilized antigens through a proteolytic mechanism. Thus, extracellular cues can determine how B cells sense and extract tethered antigens and thereby tune B cell responses in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The epithelial-specific splicing regulators Esrp1 and Esrp2 are required for mammalian development, including establishment of epidermal barrier functions. However, the mechanisms by which Esrp ablation causes defects in epithelial barriers remain undefined. We determined that the ablation of Esrp1 and Esrp2 impairs epithelial tight junction (TJ) integrity through loss of the epithelial isoform of Rho GTP exchange factor Arhgef11. Arhgef11 is required for the maintenance of TJs via RhoA activation and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Ablation or depletion of Esrp1/2 or Arhgef11 inhibits MLC phosphorylation and only the epithelial Arhgef11 isoform rescues MLC phosphorylation in Arhgef11 KO epithelial cells. Mesenchymal Arhgef11 transcripts contain a C-terminal exon that binds to PAK4 and inhibits RhoA activation byArhgef11. Deletion of the mesenchymal-specific Arhgef11 exon in Esrp1/2 KO epithelial cells using CRISPR/Cas9 restored TJ function, illustrating how splicing alterations can be mechanistically linked to disease phenotypes that result from impaired functions of splicing regulators.

Abstract: Summary
Recent evidence indicates that specific RNAs promote the formation of ribonucleoprotein condensates by acting as scaffolds for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). We systematically investigated RNA-RBP interaction networks to understand ribonucleoprotein assembly. We found that highly contacted RNAs are structured, have long UTRs, and contain nucleotide repeat expansions. Among the RNAs with such properties, we identified the FMR1 3′ UTR that harbors CGG expansions implicated in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). We studied FMR1 binding partners in silico and in vitro and prioritized the splicing regulator TRA2A for further characterization. In a FXTAS cellular model, we validated the TRA2A-FMR1 interaction and investigated implications of its sequestration at both transcriptomic and post-transcriptomic levels. We found that TRA2A co-aggregates with FMR1 in a FXTAS mouse model and in post-mortem human samples. Our integrative study identifies key components of ribonucleoprotein aggregates, providing links to neurodegenerative disease and allowing the discovery of therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Alphaviruses are enveloped pathogens that cause arthritis and encephalitis. Here, we report a 4.4-Å cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), an alphavirus that causes fatal encephalitis in humans. Our analysis provides insights into viral entry into host cells. The envelope protein E2 showed a binding site for the cellular attachment factor heparan sulfate. The presence of a cryptic E2 glycan suggests how EEEV escapes surveillance by lectin-expressing myeloid lineage cells, which are sentinels of the immune system. A mechanism for nucleocapsid core release and disassembly upon viral entry was inferred based on pH changes and capsid dissociation from envelope proteins. The EEEV capsid structure showed a viral RNA genome binding site adjacent to a ribosome binding site for viral genome translation following genome release. Using five Fab-EEEV complexes derived from neutralizing antibodies, our investigation provides insights into EEEV host cell interactions and protective epitopes relevant to vaccine design.

Here, we report that EZH2 activates androgen receptor (AR) gene transcription through direct occupancy at its promoter. Importantly, this activating role of EZH2 is independent of PRC2 and its methyltransferase activities. Genome-wide assays revealed extensive EZH2 occupancy at promoters marked by either H3K27ac or H3K27me3, leading to gene activation or repression, respectively. Last, we demonstrate enhanced efficacy of enzymatic EZH2 inhibitors when used in combination with AR antagonists in blocking the dual roles of EZH2 and suppressing prostate cancer progression in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our study reports EZH2 as a transcriptional activator, a key target of which is AR, and suggests a drug-combinatory approach to treat advanced prostate cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in genes essential for mitochondrial function have pleiotropic effects. The mechanisms underlying these traits yield insights into metabolic homeostasis and potential therapies. Here we report the characterization of a mouse model harboring a mutation in the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (Wars2) gene, encoding the mitochondrial-localized WARS2 protein. This hypomorphic allele causes progressive tissue-specific pathologies, including hearing loss, reduced adiposity, adipose tissue dysfunction, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We demonstrate the tissue heterogeneity arises as a result of variable activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway and the ability of certain tissues to respond to impaired mitochondrial translation. Many of the systemic metabolic effects are likely mediated through elevated fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) following activation of the ISR in certain tissues. These findings demonstrate the potential pleiotropy associated with Wars2 mutations in patients.

Abstract: Summary
The lack of disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative disease stems in part from our rudimentary understanding of disease mechanisms and the paucity of targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we used an integrated discovery paradigm to identify a new therapeutic target for diseases caused by α-synuclein (α-syn), a small lipid-binding protein that misfolds and aggregates in Parkinson’s disease and other disorders. Using unbiased phenotypic screening, we identified a series of compounds that were cytoprotective against α-syn-mediated toxicity by inhibiting the highly conserved enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). Critically, reducing the levels of unsaturated membrane lipids by inhibiting SCD reduced α-syn toxicity in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neuronal models. Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of fatty acid desaturation has potential as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Podocytes, highly specialized epithelial cells, build the outer part of the kidney filtration barrier and withstand high mechanical forces through a complex network of cellular protrusions. Here, we show that Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization controls actomyosin contractility and focal adhesion maturation of podocyte protrusions and thereby regulates formation, maintenance, and capacity to adapt to mechanical requirements of the filtration barrier. We find that N-WASP-Arp2/3 define the development of complex arborized podocyte protrusions in vitro and in vivo. Loss of dendritic actin networks results in a pronounced activation of the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the generation of over-maturated but less efficient adhesion, leading to detachment of podocytes. Our data provide a model to explain podocyte protrusion morphology and their mechanical stability based on a tripartite relationship between actin polymerization, contractility, and adhesion.

Abstract: Summary
The SRC-family kinase LYN is highly expressed in triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer (TNBC) and in the cell of origin of these tumors, c-KIT-positive luminal progenitors. Here, we demonstrate LYN is a downstream effector of c-KIT in normal mammary cells and protective of apoptosis upon genotoxic stress. LYN activity is modulated by PIN1, a prolyl isomerase, and in BRCA1 mutant TNBC PIN1 upregulation activates LYN independently of c-KIT. Furthermore, the full-length LYN splice isoform (as opposed to the Δaa25–45 variant) drives migration and invasion of aggressive TNBC cells, while the ratio of splice variants is informative for breast cancer-specific survival across all breast cancers. Thus, dual mechanisms—uncoupling from upstream signals and splice isoform ratios—drive the activity of LYN in aggressive breast cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Despite substantial self-renewal capability in vivo, epithelial stem and progenitor cells located in various tissues expand for a few passages in vitro in feeder-free condition before they succumb to growth arrest. Here, we describe the EpiX method, which utilizes small molecules that inhibit PAK1-ROCK-Myosin II and TGF-β signaling to achieve over one trillion-fold expansion of human epithelial stem and progenitor cells from skin, airway, mammary, and prostate glands in the absence of feeder cells. Transcriptomic and epigenomic studies show that this condition helps epithelial cells to overcome stresses for continuous proliferation. EpiX-expanded basal epithelial cells differentiate into mature epithelial cells consistent with their tissue origins. Whole-genome sequencing reveals that the cells retain remarkable genome integrity after extensive in vitro expansion without acquiring tumorigenicity. EpiX technology provides a solution to exploit the potential of tissue-resident epithelial stem and progenitor cells for regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Mapping the binding sites of DNA- or chromatin-interacting proteins is essential to understanding biological processes. DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) has emerged as a comprehensive method to map genome-wide occupancy of proteins of interest. A caveat of DamID is the specificity of Dam methyltransferase for GATC motifs that are not homogenously distributed in the genome. Here, we developed an optimized method named MadID, using proximity labeling of DNA by the methyltransferase M.EcoGII. M.EcoGII mediates N6-adenosine methylation in any DNA sequence context, resulting in deeper and unbiased coverage of the genome. We demonstrate, using m6A-specific immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing, that MadID is a robust method to identify protein-DNA interactions at the whole-genome level. Using MadID, we revealed contact sites between human telomeres, repetitive sequences devoid of GATC sites, and the nuclear envelope. Overall, MadID opens the way to identification of binding sites in genomic regions that were largely inaccessible.

Abstract: Summary
The circadian clock operates as intrinsic time-keeping machinery to preserve homeostasis in response to the changing environment. While food is a known zeitgeber for clocks in peripheral tissues, it remains unclear how lack of food influences clock function. We demonstrate that the transcriptional response to fasting operates through molecular mechanisms that are distinct from time-restricted feeding regimens. First, fasting affects core clock genes and proteins, resulting in blunted rhythmicity of BMAL1 and REV-ERBα both in liver and skeletal muscle. Second, fasting induces a switch in temporal gene expression through dedicated fasting-sensitive transcription factors such as GR, CREB, FOXO, TFEB, and PPARs. Third, the rhythmic genomic response to fasting is sustainable by prolonged fasting and reversible by refeeding. Thus, fasting imposes specialized dynamics of transcriptional coordination between the clock and nutrient-sensitive pathways, thereby achieving a switch to fasting-specific temporal gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
The balance of dopamine and acetylcholine in the dorsal striatum is critical for motor and learning functions. Midbrain dopamine cells and local cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) densely innervate the striatum and have strong reciprocal actions on each other. Although dopamine inputs regulate ChIs, the functional consequences of dopamine neuron activity across dorsal striatal regions is poorly understood. Here, we find that midbrain dopamine neurons drive pauses in the firing of dorsomedial ChIs but robust bursts in dorsolateral ChIs. Pauses are mediated by dopamine D2 receptors, while bursts are driven by glutamate corelease and activation of a mGluR-mediated excitatory conductance. We find the frequency of muscarinic cholinergic transmission to medium spiny neurons is greater in the dorsomedial striatum. This regional variation in transmission is moderated by the different actions of dopamine and glutamate corelease. These results delineate a mechanism by which dopamine inputs maintain consistent levels of cholinergic activity across the dorsal striatum.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin adopts a diversity of regular and irregular fiber structures in vitro and in vivo. However, how an array of nucleosomes folds into and switches between different fiber conformations is poorly understood. We report the 9.7 Å resolution crystal structure of a 6-nucleosome array bound to linker histone H1 determined under ionic conditions that favor incomplete chromatin condensation. The structure reveals a flat two-start helix with uniform nucleosomal stacking interfaces and a nucleosome packing density that is only half that of a twisted 30-nm fiber. Hydroxyl radical footprinting indicates that H1 binds the array in an on-dyad configuration resembling that observed for mononucleosomes. Biophysical, cryo-EM, and crosslinking data validate the crystal structure and reveal that a minor change in ionic environment shifts the conformational landscape to a more compact, twisted form. These findings provide insights into the structural plasticity of chromatin and suggest a possible assembly pathway for a 30-nm fiber.

Abstract: Summary
Microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) are widely used chemotherapy drugs capable of disrupting microtubule-dependent cellular functions, such as division and migration. We show that two clinically approved MTAs, paclitaxel and vinblastine, each suppress stiffness-sensitive migration and polarization characteristic of human glioma cells on compliant hydrogels. MTAs influence microtubule dynamics and cell traction forces by nearly opposite mechanisms, the latter of which can be explained by a combination of changes in myosin motor and adhesion clutch number. Our results support a microtubule-dependent signaling-based model for controlling traction forces through a motor-clutch mechanism, rather than microtubules directly relieving tension within F-actin and adhesions. Computational simulations of cell migration suggest that increasing protrusion number also impairs stiffness-sensitive migration, consistent with experimental MTA effects. These results provide a theoretical basis for the role of microtubules and mechanisms of MTAs in controlling cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Extensive tracts of the mammalian genome that lack protein-coding function are still transcribed into long noncoding RNA. While these lncRNAs are generally short lived, length restricted, and non-polyadenylated, how their expression is distinguished from protein-coding genes remains enigmatic. Surprisingly, depletion of the ubiquitous Pol-II-associated transcription elongation factor SPT6 promotes a redistribution of H3K36me3 histone marks from active protein coding to lncRNA genes, which correlates with increased lncRNA transcription. SPT6 knockdown also impairs the recruitment of the Integrator complex to chromatin, which results in a transcriptional termination defect for lncRNA genes. This leads to the formation of extended, polyadenylated lncRNAs that are both chromatin restricted and form increased levels of RNA:DNA hybrid (R-loops) that are associated with DNA damage. Additionally, these deregulated lncRNAs overlap with DNA replication origins leading to localized DNA replication stress and a cellular senescence phenotype. Overall, our results underline the importance of restricting lncRNA expression.

Abstract: Summary
Colorectal cancer (CRC) onset is profoundly affected by Western diet. Here, we report that high-fat (HF) diet-induced, organ-specific colonic lysine homocysteinylation (K-Hcy) increase might promote CRC onset by impeding DNA damage repair. HF chow induced elevated methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MARS) expression and K-Hcy levels and DNA damage accumulation in the mouse and rat colon, resulting in a phenotype identical to that of CRC tissues. Moreover, the increased copy number of MARS, whose protein product promotes K-Hcy, correlated with increased CRC risk in humans. Mechanistically, MARS preferentially bound to and modified ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR), inhibited ATR and its downstream effectors checkpoint kinase-1 and p53, and relieved cell-cycle arrest and decreased DNA damage-induced apoptosis by disrupting the binding of ATR-interacting protein to ATR. Inhibiting K-Hcy by targeting MARS reversed these effects and suppressed oncogenic CRC cell growth. Our study reveals a mechanism of Western-diet-associated CRC and highlights an intervention approach for reversing diet-induced oncogenic effects.

Abstract: Summary
R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG), produced at high levels by mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) enzymes, was reported as an oncometabolite. We show here that R-2HG also exerts a broad anti-leukemic activity in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting leukemia cell proliferation/viability and by promoting cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, R-2HG inhibits fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) activity, thereby increasing global N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification in R-2HG-sensitive leukemia cells, which in turn decreases the stability of MYC/CEBPA transcripts, leading to the suppression of relevant pathways. Ectopically expressed mutant IDH1 and S-2HG recapitulate the effects of R-2HG. High levels of FTO sensitize leukemic cells to R-2HG, whereas hyperactivation of MYC signaling confers resistance that can be reversed by the inhibition of MYC signaling. R-2HG also displays anti-tumor activity in glioma. Collectively, while R-2HG accumulated in IDH1/2 mutant cancers contributes to cancer initiation, our work demonstrates anti-tumor effects of 2HG in inhibiting proliferation/survival of FTO-high cancer cells via targeting FTO/m6A/MYC/CEBPA signaling.

Abstract: Drug resistance and cellular adhesion are two key elements of both dissemination and prevalence of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Smi1 belongs to a family of hub proteins conserved among the fungal kingdom whose functions in cellular signaling affect morphogenesis, cell wall synthesis and stress resistance. The data presented here indicate that C. albicans SMI1 is a functional homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae KNR4 and is involved in the regulation of cell wall synthesis. Expression of SMI1 in S. cerevisiae knr4Δ null mutants rescued their sensitivity to caspofungin and to heat stress. Deletion of SMI1 in C. albicans resulted in sensitivity to the cell-wall-perturbing compounds Calcofluor White and Caspofungin. Analysis of wild-type and mutant cells by Atomic Force Microscopy showed that the Young’s Modulus (stiffness) of the cell wall was reduced by 85% upon deletion of SMI1, while cell surface adhesion measured by Force Spectroscopy showed that the surface expression of adhesive molecules was also reduced in the mutant. Over-expression of SMI1, on the contrary, increased cell surface adhesion by 6-fold vs the control strain. Finally, Smi1-GFP localized as cytoplasmic patches and concentrated spots at the sites of new cell wall synthesis including the tips of growing hyphae, consistent with a role in cell wall regulation. Thus, Smi1 function appears to be conserved across fungi, including the yeast S. cerevisiae, the yeast and hyphal forms of C. albicans and the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.

Abstract: Summary
Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections evade antibiotic therapy and are associated with mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We find that in vitro resistance evolution of P. aeruginosa toward clinically relevant antibiotics leads to phenotypic convergence toward distinct states. These states are associated with collateral sensitivity toward several antibiotic classes and encoded by mutations in antibiotic resistance genes, including transcriptional regulator nfxB. Longitudinal analysis of isolates from CF patients reveals similar and defined phenotypic states, which are associated with extinction of specific sub-lineages in patients. In-depth investigation of chronic P. aeruginosa populations in a CF patient during antibiotic therapy revealed dramatic genotypic and phenotypic convergence. Notably, fluoroquinolone-resistant subpopulations harboring nfxB mutations were eradicated by antibiotic therapy as predicted by our in vitro data. This study supports the hypothesis that antibiotic treatment of chronic infections can be optimized by targeting phenotypic states associated with specific mutations to improve treatment success in chronic infections.

Abstract: Summary
Complement-mediated cytotoxicity may act as a selective pressure for tumor overexpression of complement regulators. We hypothesize that the same selective pressure could lead to complement alterations at the genetic level. We find that, when analyzed as a pathway, mutations in complement genes occur at a relatively high frequency and are associated with changes in overall survival across a number of cancer types. Analysis of pathways expressed in patients with complement mutations that are associated with poor overall survival reveals crosstalk between complement and hypoxia in colorectal cancer. The importance of this crosstalk is highlighted by two key findings: hypoxic signaling is increased in tumors harboring complement mutations, and hypoxic tumor cells are resistant to complement-mediated cytotoxicity due, in part, to hypoxia-induced expression of complement regulator CD55. The range of strategies employed by tumors to dysregulate the complement system testifies to the importance of this pathway in tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
A major challenge in cancer research is the complexity of the tumor microenvironment, which includes the host immunological setting. Inspired by the emerging technology of organ-on-chip, we achieved 3D co-cultures in microfluidic devices (integrating four cell populations: cancer, immune, endothelial, and fibroblasts) to reconstitute ex vivo a human tumor ecosystem (HER2+ breast cancer). We visualized and quantified the complex dynamics of this tumor-on-chip, in the absence or in the presence of the drug trastuzumab (Herceptin), a targeted antibody therapy directed against the HER2 receptor. We uncovered the capacity of the drug trastuzumab to specifically promote long cancer-immune interactions (>50 min), recapitulating an anti-tumoral ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) immune response. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) antagonized the effects of trastuzumab. These observations constitute a proof of concept that tumors-on-chip are powerful platforms to study ex vivo immunocompetent tumor microenvironments, to characterize ecosystem-level drug responses, and to dissect the roles of stromal components.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting KRAS mutant tumors through inhibition of individual downstream pathways has had limited clinical success. Here we report that RAF inhibitors exhibit little efficacy in KRAS mutant tumors. In combination drug screens, MEK and PI3K inhibitors synergized with pan-RAF inhibitors through an RAS-GTP-dependent mechanism. Broad cell line profiling with RAF/MEK inhibitor combinations revealed synergistic efficacy in KRAS mutant and wild-type tumors, with KRASG13D mutants exhibiting greater synergy versus KRASG12 mutant tumors. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that MEK inhibition induced RAS-GTP levels, RAF dimerization and RAF kinase activity resulting in MEK phosphorylation in synergistic tumor lines regardless of KRAS status. Taken together, our studies uncover a strategy to rewire KRAS mutant tumors to confer sensitivity to RAF kinase inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Our recent ERK1/2 inhibitor analyses in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) indicated ERK1/2-independent mechanisms maintaining MYC protein stability. To identify these mechanisms, we determined the signaling networks by which mutant KRAS regulates MYC. Acute KRAS suppression caused rapid proteasome-dependent loss of MYC protein, through both ERK1/2-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Surprisingly, MYC degradation was independent of PI3K-AKT-GSK3β signaling and the E3 ligase FBWX7. We then established and applied a high-throughput screen for MYC protein degradation and performed a kinome-wide proteomics screen. We identified an ERK1/2-inhibition-induced feedforward mechanism dependent on EGFR and SRC, leading to ERK5 activation and phosphorylation of MYC at S62, preventing degradation. Concurrent inhibition of ERK1/2 and ERK5 disrupted this mechanism, synergistically causing loss of MYC and suppressing PDAC growth.

Abstract: Summary
Neural population space analysis was performed to assess the dimensionality and dynamics of the neural population in the primary motor cortex (M1) during a reach-grasp-manipulation task in which both the reach location and the object being grasped were varied. We partitioned neural activity into three components: (1) general task-related activity independent of location and object, (2) location- and/or object-related activity, and (3) noise. Neural modulation related to location and/or object was only one-third the size of either general task modulation or noise. The neural dimensions of location and/or object-related activity overlapped with both the general task and noise dimensions. Rather than large amplitude modulation in a fixed set of dimensions, the active dimensions of location and/or object modulation shifted progressively over the time course of a trial.

Abstract: The central mechanisms coordinating growth and sexual maturation are well conserved across invertebrates and vertebrates. Although mutations in the gene encoding makorin RING finger protein 3 (mkrn3) are associated with central precocious puberty in humans, a causal relationship has not been elucidated. Here, we examined the role of mkrn1, a Drosophila ortholog of mammalian makorin genes, in the regulation of developmental timing. Loss of MKRN1 in mkrn1exS prolonged the 3rd instar stage and delayed the onset of pupariation, resulting in bigger size pupae. MKRN1 was expressed in the prothoracic gland, where the steroid hormone ecdysone is produced. Furthermore, mkrn1exS larvae exhibited reduced mRNA levels of phantom, which encodes ecdysone-synthesizing enzyme and E74, which is a downstream target of ecdysone. Collectively, these results indicate that MKRN1 fine-tunes developmental timing and sexual maturation by affecting ecdysone synthesis in Drosophila. Moreover, our study supports the notion that malfunction of makorin gene family member, mkrn3 dysregulates the timing of puberty in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid metabolism is highly compartmentalized between cellular organelles that dynamically adapt their compositions and interactions in response to metabolic challenges. Here, we investigate how diet-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, observed in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), affects protein localization, organelle organization, and protein phosphorylation in vivo. We develop a mass spectrometric workflow for protein and phosphopeptide correlation profiling to monitor levels and cellular distributions of ∼6,000 liver proteins and ∼16,000 phosphopeptides during development of steatosis. Several organelle contact site proteins are targeted to lipid droplets (LDs) in steatotic liver, tethering organelles orchestrating lipid metabolism. Proteins of the secretory pathway dramatically redistribute, including the mis-localization of the COPI complex and sequestration of the Golgi apparatus at LDs. This correlates with reduced hepatic protein secretion. Our systematic in vivo analysis of subcellular rearrangements and organelle-specific phosphorylation reveals how nutrient overload leads to organellar reorganization and cellular dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Notch is activated globally in pancreatic progenitors; however, for progenitors to differentiate into endocrine cells, they must escape Notch activation to express Neurogenin-3. Here, we find that the transcription factor nuclear factor I/A (NFIA) promotes endocrine development by regulating Notch ligand Dll1 trafficking. Pancreatic deletion of NFIA leads to cell fate defects, with increased duct and decreased endocrine formation, while ectopic expression promotes endocrine formation in mice and human pancreatic progenitors. NFIA-deficient mice exhibit dysregulation of trafficking-related genes including increased expression of Mib1, which acts to target Dll1 for endocytosis. We find that NFIA binds to the Mib1 promoter, with loss of NFIA leading to an increase in Dll1 internalization and enhanced Notch activation with rescue of the cell fate defects after Mib1 knockdown. This study reveals NFIA as a pro-endocrine factor in the pancreas, acting to repress Mib1, inhibit Dll1 endocytosis and thus promote escape from Notch activation.

Abstract: Summary
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the co-stimulatory molecule 4-1BB are of interest for tumor immunotherapy. We determined the complex structures of human 4-1BB with 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) or utomilumab to elucidate the structural basis of 4-1BB activation. The 4-1BB/4-1BBL complex displays a typical TNF/TNFR family binding mode. The structure of utomilumab/4-1BB complex shows that utomilumab binds to dimeric 4-1BB with a distinct but partially overlapping binding area with 4-1BBL. Competitive binding analysis demonstrates that utomilumab blocks the 4-1BB/4-1BBL interaction, indicating the interruption of ligand-mediated signaling. The binding profiles of 4-1BBL and utomilumab to monomeric or dimeric 4-1BB indicate limited cross-linking of 4-1BB molecules. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the binding of 4-1BB with its ligand and its agonist mAb, which may facilitate the future development of anti-4-1BB biologics for tumor immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Psychosocial stress accelerates myelopoietic production of monocytes and neutrophils that contributes to a variety of health complications ranging from atherosclerosis to anxiety. Here, we show that social stress in mice mobilizes hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) from the bone marrow that enter circulation, engraft into the spleen, and establish a persistent extramedullary hematopoietic depot. These splenic progenitors actively proliferate and differentiate into multiple cell types, including monocytes, neutrophils, and erythrocytes. Splenic erythropoiesis partially abrogates stress-induced anemia. Repeated injection with isoprenaline induces progenitor mobilization to the spleen, identifying a key role for β-adrenergic signaling. Moreover, protracted splenic production of CD11b+ cells persists for at least 24 days after the cessation of social stress. Thus, chronic stress establishes a persistent extramedullary hematopoietic depot that can modify a wide range of chronic disease processes and alter homeostasis of the bi-directional regulatory axis between the nervous and immune systems.

Abstract: Summary
Hematogenous metastasis is a multistep, selectin-regulated process whose mechanisms remain poorly understood. To investigate this biological pathway of cancer dissemination and better understand circulating cancer cells, we developed a high-throughput methodology that integrates organ-on-chip-like microfluidic and photoconvertible protein technologies. Our approach can ascribe single-cell velocity as a traceable cell property for off-chip analysis of the direct relationships between cell molecular profiles and adhesive phenotypes in the context of physiologically relevant fluid flow. We interrogate how natively expressed selectin ligands relate to colon cancer cell rolling frequencies and velocities and provide context for previously reported disparities in in vitro and in vivo models of selectin-mediated adhesion and metastasis. This integrated methodology represents a versatile approach for the development of anti-metastatic therapeutics as well as to generate and test mechanistic hypotheses regarding spatiotemporal processes that occur over timescales of seconds to hours with single-cell resolution.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo pathway controls the activity of YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators through a kinase cascade. Despite the critical role of this pathway in tissue growth and tumorigenesis, it remains unclear how YAP/TAZ-mediated transcription drives proliferation. By analyzing the effects of inactivating LATS1/2 kinases, the direct upstream inhibitors of YAP/TAZ, on mouse brain development and applying cell-number-normalized transcriptome analyses, we discovered that YAP/TAZ activation causes a global increase in transcription activity, known as hypertranscription, and upregulates many genes associated with cell growth and proliferation. In contrast, conventional read-depth-normalized RNA-sequencing analysis failed to detect the scope of the transcriptome shift and missed most relevant gene ontologies. Following a transient increase in proliferation, however, hypertranscription in neural progenitors triggers replication stress, DNA damage, and p53 activation, resulting in massive apoptosis. Our findings reveal a significant impact of YAP/TAZ activation on global transcription activity and have important implications for understanding YAP/TAZ function.

Abstract: Summary
Densely arranged N-linked glycans shield the HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer from antibody recognition. Strain-specific breaches in this shield (glycan holes) can be targets of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies that lack breadth. To understand the interplay between glycan holes and neutralization breadth in HIV-1 infection, we developed a sequence- and structure-based approach to identify glycan holes for individual Env sequences that are shielded in most M-group viruses. Applying this approach to 12 longitudinally followed individuals, we found that transmitted viruses with more intact glycan shields correlated with development of greater neutralization breadth. Within 2 years, glycan acquisition filled most glycan holes present at transmission, indicating escape from hole-targeting neutralizing antibodies. Glycan hole filling generally preceded the time to first detectable breadth, although time intervals varied across hosts. Thus, completely glycan-shielded viruses were associated with accelerated neutralization breadth development, suggesting that Env immunogens with intact glycan shields may be preferred components of AIDS vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Most genes mutated in microcephaly patients are expressed ubiquitously, and yet the brain is the only major organ compromised in most patients. Why the phenotype remains brain specific is poorly understood. In this study, we used in vitro differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to monitor the effect of a point mutation in kinetochore null protein 1 (KNL1; CASC5), identified in microcephaly patients, during in vitro brain development. We found that neural progenitors bearing a patient mutation showed reduced KNL1 levels, aneuploidy, and an abrogated spindle assembly checkpoint. By contrast, no reduction of KNL1 levels or abnormalities was observed in fibroblasts and neural crest cells. We established that the KNL1 patient mutation generates an exonic splicing silencer site, which mainly affects neural progenitors because of their higher levels of splicing proteins. Our results provide insight into the brain-specific phenomenon, consistent with microcephaly being the only major phenotype of patients bearing KNL1 mutation.

Abstract: Summary
An inducible gene expression program is a hallmark of the host inflammatory response. Recently, long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been shown to regulate the magnitude, duration, and resolution of these responses. Among these is lincRNA-Cox2, a dynamically regulated gene that broadly controls immune gene expression. To evaluate the in vivo functions of this lincRNA, we characterized multiple models of lincRNA-Cox2-deficient mice. LincRNA-Cox2-deficient macrophages and murine tissues had altered expression of inflammatory genes. Transcriptomic studies from various tissues revealed that deletion of the lincRNA-Cox2 locus also strongly impaired the basal and inducible expression of the neighboring gene prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (Ptgs2), encoding cyclooxygenase-2, a key enzyme in the prostaglandin biosynthesis pathway. By utilizing different genetic manipulations in vitro and in vivo, we found that lincRNA-Cox2 functions through an enhancer RNA mechanism to regulate Ptgs2. More importantly, lincRNA-Cox2 also functions in trans, independently of Ptgs2, to regulate critical innate immune genes in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Highly glycolytic cancer cells prevent intracellular acidification by excreting the glycolytic end-products lactate and H+ via the monocarboxylate transporters 1 (MCT1) and 4 (MCT4). We report that syrosingopine, an anti-hypertensive drug, is a dual MCT1 and MCT4 inhibitor (with 60-fold higher potency on MCT4) that prevents lactate and H+ efflux. Syrosingopine elicits synthetic lethality with metformin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase. NAD+, required for the ATP-generating steps of glycolysis, is regenerated from NADH by mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase or lactate dehydrogenase. Syrosingopine treatment leads to high intracellular lactate levels and thereby end-product inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase. The loss of NAD+ regeneration capacity due to combined metformin and syrosingopine treatment results in glycolytic blockade, leading to ATP depletion and cell death. Accordingly, ATP levels can be partly restored by exogenously provided NAD+, the NAD precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), or vitamin K2. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of MCT1 and MCT4 combined with metformin treatment is a potential cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer is based upon the assumption that metastases are homogeneous within a patient. We quantified immune cell types of 603 whole-slide metastases and primary colorectal tumors from 222 patients. Primary lesions, and synchronous and metachronous metastases, had a heterogeneous immune infiltrate and mutational diversity. Small metastases had frequently a low Immunoscore and T and B cell score, while a high Immunoscore was associated with a lower number of metastases. Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor treatment modified immune gene expression and significantly increased T cell densities in the metastasis core. The predictive accuracy of the Immunoscore from a single biopsy was superior to the one of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). The immune phenotype of the least-infiltrated metastasis had a stronger association with patient outcome than other metastases.

Abstract: Summary
Intratumoral (IT) STING activation results in tumor regression in preclinical models, yet factors dictating the balance between innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity are unclear. Here, clinical candidate STING agonist ADU-S100 (S100) is used in an IT dosing regimen optimized for adaptive immunity to uncover requirements for a T cell-driven response compatible with checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). In contrast to high-dose tumor ablative regimens that result in systemic S100 distribution, low-dose immunogenic regimens induce local activation of tumor-specific CD8+ effector T cells that are responsible for durable anti-tumor immunity and can be enhanced with CPIs. Both hematopoietic cell STING expression and signaling through IFNAR are required for tumor-specific T cell activation, and in the context of optimized T cell responses, TNFα is dispensable for tumor control. In a poorly immunogenic model, S100 combined with CPIs generates a survival benefit and durable protection. These results provide fundamental mechanistic insights into STING-induced anti-tumor immunity.

The epigenome plays critical roles in controlling gene expression and development. However, how the parental epigenomes transit to the zygotic epigenome in early development remains elusive. Here we show that parental-to-zygotic transition in zebrafish involves extensive erasure of parental epigenetic memory, starting with methylating gametic enhancers. Surprisingly, this occurs even prior to fertilization for sperm. Both parental enhancers lose histone marks by the 4-cell stage, and zygotic enhancers are not activated until around zygotic genome activation (ZGA). By contrast, many promoters remain hypomethylated and, unexpectedly, acquire histone acetylation before ZGA at as early as the 4-cell stage. They then resolve into either activated or repressed promoters upon ZGA. Maternal depletion of histone acetyltransferases results in aberrant ZGA and early embryonic lethality. Finally, such reprogramming is largely driven by maternal factors, with zygotic products mainly contributing to embryonic enhancer activation. These data reveal widespread enhancer dememorization and promoter priming during parental-to-zygotic transition.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant proteins can be deleterious to cells and are cleared by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. A group of C-end degrons that are recognized by specific cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligases (CRLs) has recently been identified in some of these abnormal polypeptides. Here, we report three crystal structures of a CRL2 substrate receptor, KLHDC2, in complex with the diglycine-ending C-end degrons of two early-terminated selenoproteins and the N-terminal proteolytic fragment of USP1. The E3 recognizes the degron peptides in a similarly coiled conformation and cradles their C-terminal diglycine with a deep surface pocket. By hydrogen bonding with multiple backbone carbonyls of the peptides, KLHDC2 further locks in the otherwise degenerate degrons with a compact interface and unexpected high affinities. Our results reveal the structural mechanism by which KLHDC2 recognizes the simplest C-end degron and suggest a functional necessity of the E3 to tightly maintain the low abundance of its select substrates.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity modifies T cell populations in adipose tissue, thereby contributing to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Here, we show that Rab4b, a small GTPase governing endocytic trafficking, is pivotal in T cells for the development of these pathological events. Rab4b expression is decreased in adipose T cells from mice and patients with obesity. The specific depletion of Rab4b in T cells causes adipocyte hypertrophy and insulin resistance in chow-fed mice and worsens insulin resistance in obese mice. This phenotype is driven by an increase in adipose Th17 and a decrease in adipose Treg due to a cell-autonomous skew of differentiation toward Th17. The Th17/Treg imbalance initiates adipose tissue inflammation and reduces adipogenesis, leading to lipid deposition in liver and muscles. Therefore, we propose that the obesity-induced loss of Rab4b in adipose T cells may contribute to maladaptive white adipose tissue remodeling and insulin resistance by altering adipose T cell fate.

Abstract: Summary
Accumulation of visceral adiposity is directly linked to the morbidity of obesity, while subcutaneous body fat is considered more benign. We have identified an unexpected role for B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6), a critical regulator of immunity, in the developmental expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue. In adipocyte-specific knockout mice (Bcl6AKO), we found that Bcl6 deletion results in strikingly increased inguinal, but not perigonadal, adipocyte size and tissue mass in addition to marked insulin sensitivity. Genome-wide RNA expression and DNA binding analyses revealed that BCL6 controls gene networks involved in cell growth and fatty acid biosynthesis. Using deuterium label incorporation and comprehensive adipokine and lipid profiling, we discovered that ablation of adipocyte Bcl6 enhances subcutaneous adipocyte lipogenesis, increases levels of adiponectin and fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs), and prevents steatosis. Thus, our studies identify BCL6 as a negative regulator of subcutaneous adipose tissue expansion and metabolic health.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA binding protein DAZL is essential for gametogenesis, but its direct in vivo functions, RNA targets, and the molecular basis for germ cell loss in Dazl-null mice are unknown. Here, we mapped transcriptome-wide DAZL-RNA interactions in vivo, revealing DAZL binding to thousands of mRNAs via polyA-proximal 3′ UTR interactions. In parallel, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA-seq identified mRNAs sensitive to DAZL deletion in male germ cells. Despite binding a broad set of mRNAs, integrative analyses indicate that DAZL post-transcriptionally controls only a subset of its mRNA targets, namely those corresponding to a network of genes that are critical for germ cell proliferation and survival. In addition, we provide evidence that polyA sequences have key roles in specifying DAZL-RNA interactions across the transcriptome. Our results reveal a mechanism for DAZL-RNA binding and illustrate that DAZL functions as a master regulator of a post-transcriptional mRNA program essential for germ cell survival.

Abstract: Summary
The exact identity of castrate-resistant (CR) cells and their relation to CR prostate cancer (CRPC) is unresolved. We use single-cell gene profiling to analyze the molecular heterogeneity in basal and luminal compartments. Within the luminal compartment, we identify a subset of cells intrinsically resistant to castration with a bi-lineage gene expression pattern. We discover LY6D as a marker of CR prostate progenitors with multipotent differentiation and enriched organoid-forming capacity. Lineage tracing further reveals that LY6D+ CR luminal cells can produce LY6D− luminal cells. In contrast, in luminal cells lacking PTEN, LY6D+ cells predominantly give rise to LY6D+ tumor cells, contributing to high-grade PIN lesions. Gene expression analyses in patients’ biopsies indicate that LY6D expression correlates with early disease progression, including progression to CRPC. Our studies thus identify a subpopulation of luminal progenitors characterized by LY6D expression and intrinsic castration resistance. LY6D may serve as a prognostic maker for advanced prostate cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1 maintains developmental genes in a poised state through monoubiquitination (Ub) of histone H2A. Although Ub-independent functions of PRC1 have also been suggested, it has remained unclear whether Ub-dependent and -independent functions of PRC1 operate differentially in a developmental context. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Ring1B, a core component of PRC1, is necessary for the temporary repression of key neuronal genes in neurogenic (early-stage) neural stem or progenitor cells (NPCs) but is dispensable for the persistent repression of these genes associated with the loss of neurogenic potential in astrogliogenic (late-stage) NPCs. Our results also suggest that histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity of the NuRD/MBD3 complex and Phc2-dependent PRC1 clustering are necessary for the transition from the Ub-dependent to -independent function of PRC1. Together, these results indicate that Ub-independent mode of repression by PRC1 plays a key role in mammalian development during cell fate restriction.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for lymphatic vascular development. Oscillatory shear stress (OSS) enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) to induce expression of the lymphedema-associated transcription factors GATA2 and FOXC2. However, the mechanisms by which OSS regulates Wnt/β-catenin signaling and GATA2 and FOXC2 expression are unknown. We show that OSS activates autocrine Wnt/β-catenin signaling in LECs in vitro. Tissue-specific deletion of Wntless, which is required for the secretion of Wnt ligands, reveals that LECs and vascular smooth muscle cells are complementary sources of Wnt ligands that regulate lymphatic vascular development in vivo. Further, the LEC master transcription factor PROX1 forms a complex with β-catenin and the TCF/LEF transcription factor TCF7L1 to enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling and promote FOXC2 and GATA2 expression in LECs. Thus, our work defines Wnt sources, reveals that PROX1 directs cell fate by acting as a Wnt signaling component, and dissects the mechanisms of PROX1 and Wnt synergy.

Abstract: Summary
Transcriptional and translational feedback loops in fungi and animals drive circadian rhythms in transcript levels that provide output from the clock, but post-transcriptional mechanisms also contribute. To determine the extent and underlying source of this regulation, we applied newly developed analytical tools to a long-duration, deeply sampled, circadian proteomics time course comprising half of the proteome. We found a quarter of expressed proteins are clock regulated, but >40% of these do not arise from clock-regulated transcripts, and our analysis predicts that these protein rhythms arise from oscillations in translational rates. Our data highlighted the impact of the clock on metabolic regulation, with central carbon metabolism reflecting both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control and opposing metabolic pathways showing peak activities at different times of day. The transcription factor CSP-1 plays a role in this metabolic regulation, contributing to the rhythmicity and phase of clock-regulated proteins.

Abstract: The stem cell factor (SCF)/c-KIT axis plays an important role in the hematopoietic differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), but its regulatory mechanisms involving microRNAs (miRs) are not fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that supplementation with SCF increases the hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs via the interaction with its receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT, which is modulated by miR-221 and miR-222. c-KIT is comparably expressed in undifferentiated human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. The inhibition of SCF signaling via treatment with a c-KIT antagonist (imatinib) during hPSC-derived hematopoiesis resulted in reductions in the yield and multi-lineage potential of hematopoietic progenitors. We found that the transcript levels of miR-221 and miR-222 targeting c-KIT were significantly lower in the pluripotent state than they were in terminally differentiated somatic cells. Furthermore, suppression of miR-221 and miR-222 in undifferentiated hPSC cultures induced more hematopoiesis by increasing c-KIT expression. Collectively, our data implied that the modulation of c-KIT by miRs may provide further potential strategies to expedite the generation of functional blood cells for therapeutic approaches and the study of the cellular machinery related to hematologic malignant diseases such as leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Despite burgeoning evidence demonstrating the adaptive properties of natural killer (NK) cells, mechanistic data explaining these phenomena are lacking. Following antibody sensitization, NK cells lacking the Fc receptor (FcR) signaling chain (Δg) acquire adaptive features, including robust proliferation, multifunctionality, rapid killing, and mobilization to sites of virus exposure. Using the rhesus macaque model, we demonstrate the systemic distribution of Δg NK cells expressing memory features, including downregulated Helios and Eomes. Furthermore, we find that Δg NK cells abandon typical γ-chain/Syk in lieu of CD3ζ-Zap70 signaling. FCγRIIIa (CD16) density, mucosal homing, and function are all coupled to this alternate signaling, which in itself requires priming by rhesus cytomegalovirus (rhCMV). Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections further expand gut-homing adaptive NK cells but result in pathogenic suppression of CD3ζ-Zap70 signaling and function. Herein, we provide a mechanism of virus-dependent alternative signaling that may explain the acquisition of adaptive features by primate NK cells and could be targeted for future vaccine or curative therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Signal transduction pathways stimulated by secreted growth factors are tightly regulated at multiple levels between the cell surface and the nucleus. The trafficking of cell surface receptors is emerging as a key step for regulating appropriate cellular responses, with perturbations in this process contributing to human diseases, including cancer. For receptors recognizing ligands of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family, little is known about how trafficking is regulated or how this shapes signaling dynamics. Here, using whole genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens, we have identified the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery as a crucial determinant of signal duration. Downregulation of ESCRT components increases the outputs of TGF-β signaling and sensitizes cells to low doses of ligand in their microenvironment. This sensitization drives an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to low doses of ligand, and we demonstrate a link between downregulation of the ESCRT machinery and cancer survival.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity-related diseases affect half of the global population, and bariatric surgery is one of the few interventions with long-lasting weight loss and cardio-metabolic effects. Here, we investigated the effect of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery on the plasma proteome, hypothesizing that specific proteins or protein patterns may serve as key mediators and markers of the metabolic response. We performed mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics on two longitudinal studies encompassing 47 morbidly obese patients, generating quantitative information on more than 1,700 proteins. A global correlation matrix incorporating about 200,000 relationships revealed functional connections between proteins and assigned them to physiological processes. The main classes of significantly altered proteins were markers of systemic inflammation and those involved in lipid metabolism. Our data highlight robust correlative and anti-correlative behaviors of circulating proteins to each other and to clinical parameters. A group of inflammation-related proteins showed distinct inverse relationships to proteins consistently associated with insulin sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota is strongly influenced by environmental factors, although host contribution is far less understood. We leveraged macrophage-deficient interferon regulatory factor irf8 zebrafish mutants to investigate the role of macrophages in this process. In conventionally raised adult irf8-deficient mutants, we found a significant loss of intestinal macrophages associated with a strikingly altered gut microbiota when compared to co-housed siblings. The destabilization of the gut commensal microbiota was associated with a severe reduction in complement C1q genes and outgrowth of a rare bacterial species. Consistent with a critical function of irf8 in adult intestinal macrophages, irf8 is abundantly expressed in these cells normally, and restoring macrophage irf8 expression in irf8 mutants was sufficient to recover commensal microbes and C1q genes expression. This study reports an important subpopulation of intestinal macrophages that requires irf8 to establish in the gut, ensure normal colonization of gut microbes, and prevent immune dysregulation.

Abstract: Summary
We and others have recently reported that the SMC protein Smchd1 is a regulator of chromosome conformation. Smchd1 is critical for the structure of the inactive X chromosome and at autosomal targets such as the Hox genes. However, it is unknown how Smchd1 is recruited to these sites. Here, we report that Smchd1 localizes to the inactive X via the Xist-HnrnpK-PRC1 (polycomb repressive complex 1) pathway. Contrary to previous reports, Smchd1 does not bind Xist or other RNA molecules with any specificity. Rather, the localization of Smchd1 to the inactive X is H2AK119ub dependent. Following perturbation of this interaction, Smchd1 is destabilized, which has consequences for gene silencing genome-wide. Our work adds Smchd1 to the PRC1 silencing pathway for X chromosome inactivation.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from islet β cells is mediated by KATP channels. However, the role of non-KATP K+ channels in insulin secretion is largely unknown. Here, we show that a non-KATP K+ channel, KCNH6, plays a key role in insulin secretion and glucose hemostasis in humans and mice. KCNH6 p.P235L heterozygous mutation co-separated with diabetes in a four-generation pedigree. Kcnh6 knockout (KO) or Kcnh6 p.P235L knockin (KI) mice had a phenotype characterized by changing from hypoglycemia with hyperinsulinemia to hyperglycemia with insulin deficiency. Islets from the young KO mice had increased intracellular calcium concentration and increased insulin secretion. However, islets from the adult KO mice not only had increased intracellular calcium levels but also had remarkable ER stress and apoptosis, associated with loss of β cell mass and decreased insulin secretion. Therefore, dysfunction of KCNH6 causes overstimulation of insulin secretion in the short term and β cell failure in the long term.

Abstract: Summary
Antibody affinity maturation, which is an antigen-based selection process for B cells, occurs in germinal centers (GCs). GCB cells must efficiently recognize, acquire, and present antigens from follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) to receive positive selection signals from T helper cells. Previous studies showed that GCB cells undergo adhesive interactions with FDCs, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying the cell adhesions and their functional relevance remain unclear. Here, we identified H3K36me2 methyltransferase Nsd2 as a critical regulator of GCB cell-FDC adhesion. Nsd2 deletion modestly reduced GC responses but strongly impaired B cell affinity maturation. Mechanistically, Nsd2 directly regulated expression of multiple actin polymerization-related genes in GCB cells. Nsd2 loss reduced B cell adhesion to FDC-expressed adhesion molecules, thus affecting both B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and antigen acquisition. Overall, Nsd2 coordinates GCB positive selection by enhancing both BCR signaling and T cell help.

Abstract: Summary
Mediator of IRF3 activation (MITA), also known as stimulator of interferon genes (STING), plays a vital role in the innate immune responses to cytosolic dsDNA. The trafficking of MITA from the ER to perinuclear vesicles is necessary for its activation of the downstream molecules, which lead to the production of interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the exact mechanism of MITA activation remains elusive. Here, we report that transmembrane emp24 protein transport domain containing 2 (TMED2) potentiates DNA virus-induced MITA signaling. The suppression or deletion of TMED2 markedly impairs the production of type I IFNs upon HSV-1 infection. TMED2-deficient cells harbor greater HSV-1 load than the control cells. Mechanistically, TMED2 associates with MITA only upon viral stimulation, and this process potentiates MITA activation by reinforcing its dimerization and facilitating its trafficking. These findings suggest an essential role of TMED2 in cellular IFN responses to DNA viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Compelling evidence has shown that, besides its putative effect on the regulation of the gonadal axis, estradiol (E2) exerts a dichotomic effect on the hypothalamus to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. The anorectic effect of E2 is mainly mediated by its action on the arcuate nucleus (ARC), whereas its effects on brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis occur in the ventromedial nucleus (VMH). Here, we demonstrate that central E2 decreases hypothalamic ceramide levels and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Pharmacological or genetic blockade of ceramide synthesis and amelioration of ER stress selectively occurring in the VMH recapitulate the effect of E2, leading to increased BAT thermogenesis, weight loss, and metabolic improvement. These findings demonstrate that E2 regulation of ceramide-induced hypothalamic lipotoxicity and ER stress is an important determinant of energy balance, suggesting that dysregulation of this mechanism may underlie some changes in energy homeostasis seen in females.

Abstract: Summary
Quantitative traits are influenced by pathways that have traditionally been defined through genes that have a large loss- or gain-of-function effect. However, in theory, a large number of small effect size genes could cumulatively play a substantial role in pathway function. Here, we determine the number, strength, and identity of all non-essential test genes that affect two quantitative galactose-responsive traits in addition to re-analyzing two previously screened quantitative traits. We find that over a quarter of assayed genes have a detectable, quantitative effect on phenotype. Despite their ubiquity, these genes are enriched in core cellular processes in a trait-specific manner. In a simulated population with 50% frequency of all-or-none alleles, we show that small effect size alleles are capable of contributing more to trait variation than alleles in a canonical, large effect size pathway. In total, by demonstrating that the genes effecting quantitative traits can be highly distributed and interconnected, this work challenges the concept of pathways as modular and independent.

Abstract: Summary
Latently infected T cells able to reinitiate viral propagation throughout the body remain a major barrier to curing HIV. Distinguishing between latently infected cells and uninfected cells will advance efforts for viral eradication. HIV decision-making between latency and active replication is stochastic, and drug cocktails that increase bursts of viral gene expression enhance reactivation from latency. Here, we show that a larger host-cell size provides a natural cellular mechanism for enhancing burst size of viral expression and is necessary to destabilize the latent state and bias viral decision-making. Latently infected Jurkat and primary CD4+ T cells reactivate exclusively in larger activated cells, while smaller cells remain silent. In addition, reactivation is cell-cycle dependent and can be modulated with cell-cycle-arresting compounds. Cell size and cell-cycle dependent decision-making of viral circuits may guide stochastic design strategies and applications in synthetic biology and may provide important determinants to advance diagnostics and therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of myelinating Schwann cells (mSCs) involves the remarkable biogenic process, which rapidly generates the myelin sheath. Once formed, the mSC transitions to a stable homeostatic state, with loss of this stability associated with neuropathies. The histone deacetylases histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and HDAC2 are required for the myelination transcriptional program. Here, we show a distinct role for HDAC3, in that, while dispensable for the formation of mSCs, it is essential for the stability of the myelin sheath once formed—with loss resulting in progressive severe neuropathy in adulthood. This is associated with the prior failure to downregulate the biogenic program upon entering the homeostatic state leading to hypertrophy and hypermyelination of the mSCs, progressing to the development of severe myelination defects. Our results highlight distinct roles of HDAC1/2 and HDAC3 in controlling the differentiation and homeostatic states of a cell with broad implications for the understanding of this important cell-state transition.

Abstract: Lack of potential regenerative medicine to reconstruct damaged cartilage tissue has accelerated investigation and development of potential biomaterial for cartilage tissue engineering. In this study, we fabricated micron-sized non-mulberry silk fibroin fiber (SFF) using N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAC)/10% LiBr solution and further used to develop SFF reinforced chitosan(CH) based porous scaffold with desired pore size, porosity, swelling and structural stability. The developed scaffold was characterized for its various physico-chemical, mechanical and biological properties. The developed CH/SFF composite scaffold facilitates human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSCs) attachment, colonization and extracellular matrix deposition. Furthermore, hMSCs shows significantly higher sulfated glycosaminoglycan deposition over CH/SFF in comparison to pure chitosan scaffold (control). Immunocytochemistry studies have shown enhanced expression of collagen type II and aggrecan by hMSCs over composite scaffold than chitosan scaffold. Thus, non-mulberry silk fibroin fiber reinforced chitosan based scaffold might be suitable scaffold that can act as a potential artificial matrix for cartilage tissue engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression and its network structure are dynamically altered in multicellular systems during morphological, functional, and pathological changes. To precisely analyze the functional roles of dynamic gene expression changes, tools that manipulate gene expression at fine spatiotemporal resolution are needed. The tetracycline (Tet)-controlled gene expression system is a reliable drug-inducible method, and it is used widely in many mammalian cultured cells and model organisms. Here, we develop a photoactivatable (PA)-Tet-OFF/ON system for precise temporal control of gene expression at single-cell resolution. By integrating the cryptochrome 2-cryptochrome-interacting basic helix-loop-helix 1 (Cry2-CIB1) light-inducible binding switch, expression of the gene of interest is tightly regulated under the control of light illumination and drug application in our PA-Tet-OFF/ON system. This system has a large dynamic range of downstream gene expression and rapid activation/deactivation kinetics. We also demonstrate the optogenetic regulation of exogenous gene expression in vivo, such as in developing and adult mouse brains.

Abstract: Summary
Despite a prevalence exceeding 1%, mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are poorly understood, and targeted therapies and guiding parameters are urgently needed. We recently demonstrated that cerebellar dysfunction is sufficient to generate autistic-like behaviors in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Here, using the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-specific inhibitor rapamycin, we define distinct sensitive periods for treatment of autistic-like behaviors with sensitive periods extending into adulthood for social behaviors. We identify cellular and electrophysiological parameters that may contribute to behavioral rescue, with rescue of Purkinje cell survival and excitability corresponding to social behavioral rescue. In addition, using anatomic and diffusion-based MRI, we identify structural changes in cerebellar domains implicated in ASD that correlate with sensitive periods of specific autism-like behaviors. These findings thus not only define treatment parameters into adulthood, but also support a mechanistic basis for the targeted rescue of autism-related behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Non-coding “ultraconserved” regions containing hundreds of consecutive bases of perfect sequence conservation across mammalian genomes can function as distant-acting enhancers. However, initial deletion studies in mice revealed that loss of such extraordinarily constrained sequences had no immediate impact on viability. Here, we show that ultraconserved enhancers are required for normal development. Focusing on some of the longest ultraconserved sites genome wide, located near the essential neuronal transcription factor Arx, we used genome editing to create an expanded series of knockout mice lacking individual or combinations of ultraconserved enhancers. Mice with single or pairwise deletions of ultraconserved enhancers were viable and fertile but in nearly all cases showed neurological or growth abnormalities, including substantial alterations of neuron populations and structural brain defects. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of ultraconserved enhancers and indicate that remarkably strong sequence conservation likely results from fitness deficits that appear subtle in a laboratory setting.

Abstract: Triclosan (TCS) is a phenolic antimicrobial chemical used in consumer products and medical devices. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo animal studies has linked TCS to numerous health problems, including allergic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disease. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system, we here show that short-term TCS treatment (LC50: ~0.2 mM) significantly induced mortality in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, TCS-induced mortality was dramatically suppressed by co-treatment with non-ionic surfactants (NISs: e.g., Tween 20, Tween 80, NP-40, and Triton X-100), but not with anionic surfactants (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate). To identify the range of compounds susceptible to NIS inhibition, other structurally related chemical compounds were also examined. Of the compounds tested, only the toxicity of phenolic compounds (bisphenol A and benzyl 4-hydroxybenzoic acid) was significantly abrogated by NISs. Mechanistic analyses using TCS revealed that NISs appear to interfere with TCS-mediated mortality by micellar solubilization. Once internalized, the TCS-micelle complex is inefficiently exported in worms lacking PMP-3 (encoding an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter) transmembrane protein, resulting in overt toxicity. Since many EDCs and surfactants are extensively used in commercial products, findings from this study provide valuable insights to devise safer pharmaceutical and nutritional preparations.

Abstract: Summary
Interferon α (IFNα) is a prompt and efficient orchestrator of host defense against nucleic acids but upon chronicity becomes a potent mediator of autoimmunity. Sustained IFNα signaling is linked to pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an incurable autoimmune disease characterized by aberrant self-DNA sensing that culminates in anti-DNA autoantibody-mediated pathology. IFNα instructs monocytes differentiation into autoinflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) than potentiates the survival and expansion of autoreactive lymphocytes, but the molecular mechanism bridging sterile IFNα-danger alarm with adaptive response against self-DNA remains elusive. Herein, we demonstrate IFNα-mediated deregulation of mitochondrial metabolism and impairment of autophagic degradation, leading to cytosolic accumulation of mtDNA that is sensed via stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to promote induction of autoinflammatory DCs. Identification of mtDNA as a cell-autonomous enhancer of IFNα signaling underlines the significance of efficient mitochondrial recycling in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. Antioxidant treatment and metabolic rescue of autolysosomal degradation emerge as drug targets in SLE and other IFNα-related pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) allow extracellular stimuli to redistribute Ca2+ from the ER to cytosol or other organelles. We show, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitors, that lysosomes sequester Ca2+ released by all IP3R subtypes, but not Ca2+ entering cells through store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). A low-affinity Ca2+ sensor targeted to lysosomal membranes reports large, local increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] during IP3-evoked Ca2+ release, but not during SOCE. Most lysosomes associate with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and dwell at regions populated by IP3R clusters, but IP3Rs do not assemble ER-lysosome contacts. Increasing lysosomal pH does not immediately prevent Ca2+ uptake, but it causes lysosomes to slowly redistribute and enlarge, reduces their association with IP3Rs, and disrupts Ca2+ exchange with ER. In a “piston-like” fashion, ER concentrates cytosolic Ca2+ and delivers it, through large-conductance IP3Rs, to a low-affinity lysosomal uptake system. The involvement of IP3Rs allows extracellular stimuli to regulate Ca2+ exchange between the ER and lysosomes.

Abstract: Summary
Although Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) require interleukin-2 (IL-2) for their development, it has been unclear whether continuing IL-2 signals are needed to maintain lineage stability, survival, and suppressor function in mature Tregs. We generated mice in which CD25, the main ligand-binding subunit of the IL-2 receptor, can be inducibly deleted from Tregs after thymic development. In contrast to Treg development, we find that IL-2 is dispensable for maintaining lineage stability in mature Tregs. Although continuous IL-2 signaling is needed for long-term Treg survival, CD25-deleted Tregs may persist for several weeks in vivo using IL-7. We also observe defects in glycolytic metabolism and suppressor function following CD25 deletion. Thus, unlike developing Tregs in which the primary role of IL-2 is to initiate Foxp3 expression, mature Tregs require continuous IL-2 signaling to maintain survival and suppressor function, but not to maintain lineage stability.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal mRNAs synthesized during oogenesis initiate the development of future generations. Some maternal mRNAs are either somatic or germline determinants and must be translationally repressed until embryogenesis. However, the translational repressors themselves are temporally regulated. We used polar granule component (pgc), a Drosophila maternal mRNA, to ask how maternal transcripts are repressed while the regulatory landscape is shifting. pgc, a germline determinant, is translationally regulated throughout oogenesis. We find that different conserved RNA-binding proteins bind a 10-nt sequence in the 3′ UTR of pgc mRNA to continuously repress translation at different stages of oogenesis. Pumilio binds to this sequence in undifferentiated and early-differentiating oocytes to block Pgc translation. After differentiation, Bruno levels increase, allowing Bruno to bind the same sequence and take over translational repression of pgc mRNA. We have identified a class of maternal mRNAs that are regulated similarly, including zelda, the activator of the zygotic genome.

Abstract: Summary
The protein deacetylase SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1) regulates many cellular processes, including cell-cycle progression, DNA damage response, and metabolism. Although the centrosome is a key regulator of cell-cycle progression and genome stability, little is known concerning SIRT1 controlled centrosome-associated events. Here we report that the centrosome protein Plk2 is acetylated and undergoes deacetylation by SIRT1. Acetylation protects Plk2 from ubiquitination, and SIRT1-mediated deacetylation promotes ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Plk2. SIRT1 controls centriole duplication by temporally modulating centrosomal Plk2 levels. AURKA phosphorylates SIRT1 and promotes the SIRT1-Plk2 interaction in mitosis. In early-mid G1, phosphorylated SIRT1 deacetylates and promotes Plk2 degradation. In late G1, SIRT1 is hypophosphorylated and its affinity to Plk2 is decreased, resulting in a rapid accumulation of centrosomal Plk2, which contributes to the timely initiation of centriole duplication. Collectively, our findings uncover a critical role of SIRT1 in centriole duplication and provide a mechanistic insight into SIRT1-mediated centrosome-associated functions.

Abstract: Summary
Hippo signaling has been recognized as a key tumor suppressor pathway. Here, we perform a comprehensive molecular characterization of 19 Hippo core genes in 9,125 tumor samples across 33 cancer types using multidimensional “omic” data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We identify somatic drivers among Hippo genes and the related microRNA (miRNA) regulators, and using functional genomic approaches, we experimentally characterize YAP and TAZ mutation effects and miR-590 and miR-200a regulation for TAZ. Hippo pathway activity is best characterized by a YAP/TAZ transcriptional target signature of 22 genes, which shows robust prognostic power across cancer types. Our elastic-net integrated modeling further reveals cancer-type-specific pathway regulators and associated cancer drivers. Our results highlight the importance of Hippo signaling in squamous cell cancers, characterized by frequent amplification of YAP/TAZ, high expression heterogeneity, and significant prognostic patterns. This study represents a systems-biology approach to characterizing key cancer signaling pathways in the post-genomic era.

Abstract: Summary
Breast cancer (BC) comprises multiple distinct subtypes that differ genetically, pathologically, and clinically. Here, we describe a robust protocol for long-term culturing of human mammary epithelial organoids. Using this protocol, >100 primary and metastatic BC organoid lines were generated, broadly recapitulating the diversity of the disease. BC organoid morphologies typically matched the histopathology, hormone receptor status, and HER2 status of the original tumor. DNA copy number variations as well as sequence changes were consistent within tumor-organoid pairs and largely retained even after extended passaging. BC organoids furthermore populated all major gene-expression-based classification groups and allowed in vitro drug screens that were consistent with in vivo xeno-transplantations and patient response. This study describes a representative collection of well-characterized BC organoids available for cancer research and drug development, as well as a strategy to assess in vitro drug response in a personalized fashion.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of microRNA (miRNA) sorting into extracellular vesicles (EVs) revealed a novel mode of intercellular communication and uncovered a link between cellular endomembrane compartments and small RNAs in EV-secreting cells. Using a two-step ultracentrifugation procedure to isolate EVs released by T cells, we found that 45% of tRNA fragments (tRFs), but fewer than 1% of miRNAs, were significantly enriched in EVs compared with the corresponding cellular RNA. T cell activation induced the EV-mediated release of a specific set of tRFs derived from the 5′ end and 3′-internal region of tRNAs without variable loops. Inhibition of EV biogenesis pathways specifically led to the accumulation of these activation-induced EV-enriched tRFs within multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Introducing antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit these tRFs enhanced T cell activation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that T cells selectively release tRFs into EVs via MVBs and suggest that this process may remove tRFs that repress immune activation.

Abstract: Summary
Constituents of multiprotein complexes are required at well-defined levels relative to each other. However, it remains unknown whether eukaryotic cells typically produce precise amounts of subunits, or instead rely on degradation to mitigate imprecise production. Here, we quantified the production rates of multiprotein complexes in unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes using ribosome profiling. By resolving read-mapping ambiguities, which occur for a large fraction of ribosome footprints and distort quantitation accuracy in eukaryotes, we found that obligate components of multiprotein complexes are produced in proportion to their stoichiometry, indicating that their abundances are already precisely tuned at the synthesis level. By systematically interrogating the impact of gene dosage variations in budding yeast, we found a general lack of negative feedback regulation protecting the normally precise rates of subunit synthesis. These results reveal a core principle of proteome homeostasis and highlight the evolution toward quantitative control at every step in the central dogma.

Abstract: Summary
A comprehensive cellular anatomy of normal human prostate is essential for solving the cellular origins of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. The tools used to analyze the contribution of individual cell types are not robust. We provide a cellular atlas of the young adult human prostate and prostatic urethra using an iterative process of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry on ∼98,000 cells taken from different anatomical regions. Immunohistochemistry with newly derived cell type-specific markers revealed the distribution of each epithelial and stromal cell type on whole mounts, revising our understanding of zonal anatomy. Based on discovered cell surface markers, flow cytometry antibody panels were designed to improve the purification of each cell type, with each gate confirmed by scRNA-seq. The molecular classification, anatomical distribution, and purification tools for each cell type in the human prostate create a powerful resource for experimental design in human prostate disease.

Abstract: Summary
Long-lived reservoirs of persistent HIV are a major barrier to a cure. CD4+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have the capacity for lifelong survival, self-renewal, and the generation of daughter cells. Recent evidence shows that they are also susceptible to HIV infection in vitro and in vivo. Whether HSPCs harbor infectious virus or contribute to plasma virus (PV) is unknown. Here, we provide strong evidence that clusters of identical proviruses from HSPCs and their likely progeny often match residual PV. A higher proportion of these sequences match residual PV than proviral genomes from bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells that are observed only once. Furthermore, an analysis of near-full-length genomes isolated from HSPCs provides evidence that HSPCs harbor functional HIV proviral genomes that often match residual PV. These results support the conclusion that HIV-infected HSPCs form a distinct and functionally significant reservoir of persistent HIV in infected people.

Abstract: Summary
Emphysema results in destruction of alveolar walls and enlargement of lung airspaces and has been shown to develop during helminth infections through IL-4R-independent mechanisms. We examined whether interleukin 17A (IL-17A) may instead modulate development of emphysematous pathology in mice infected with the helminth parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. We found that transient elevations in IL-17A shortly after helminth infection triggered subsequent emphysema that destroyed alveolar structures. Furthermore, lung B cells, activated through IL-4R signaling, inhibited early onset of emphysematous pathology. IL-10 and other regulatory cytokines typically associated with B regulatory cell function did not play a major role in this response. Instead, at early stages of the response, B cells produced high levels of the tissue-protective protein, Resistin-like molecule α (RELMα), which then downregulated IL-17A expression. These studies show that transient elevations in IL-17A trigger emphysema and reveal a helminth-induced immune regulatory mechanism that controls IL-17A and the severity of emphysema.

Abstract: Summary
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is enriched in brain and has been recognized as an important DNA modification. However, the roles of 5hmC and its writers, ten-eleven translocation (Tet) proteins, in stress-induced response have yet to be elucidated. Here, we show that chronic restraint stress (CRS) induced depression-like behavior in mice and resulted in a 5hmC reduction in prefrontal cortex (PFC). We found that loss of Tet1 (Tet1 KO) led to resistance to CRS, whereas loss of Tet2 (Tet2 KO) increased the susceptibility of mice to CRS. Genome-wide 5hmC profiling identified the phenotype-associated stress-induced dynamically hydroxymethylated loci (PA-SI-DhMLs), which are strongly enriched with hypoxia-induced factor (HIF) binding motifs. We demonstrated the physical interaction between TET1 and HIF1α induced by CRS and revealed that the increased HIF1α binding under CRS is associated with SI-DhMLs. These results suggest that TET1 could regulate stress-induced response by interacting with HIF1α.

Abstract: From Xenopus embryo studies, the BMP4/Smad1-targeted gene circuit is a key signaling pathway for specifying the cell fate between the ectoderm and neuro-ectoderm as well as the ventral and dorsal mesoderm. In this context, several BMP4/Smad1 target transcriptional factors have been identified as repressors of the neuro-ectoderm. However, none of these direct target transcription factors in this pathway, including GATA1b, Msx1 and Ventx1.1 have yet been proven as direct repressors of early neuro-ectodermal gene expression. In order to demonstrate that Ventx1.1 is a direct repressor of neuro-ectoderm genes, a genome-wide Xenopus ChIP-Seq of Ventx1.1 was performed. In this study, we demonstrated that Ventx1.1 bound to the Ventx1.1 response cis-acting element 1 and 2 (VRE1 and VRE2) on the promoter for zic3, which is a key early neuro-ectoderm gene, and this Ventx1.1 binding led to repression of zic3 transcription. Site-directed mutagenesis of VRE1 and VRE2 within zic3 promoter completely abolished the repression caused by Ventx1.1. In addition, we found both the positive and negative regulation of zic3 promoter activity by FoxD5b and Xcad2, respectively, and that these occur through the VREs and via modulation of Ventx1.1 levels. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the BMP4/Smad1 target gene, Ventx1.1, is a direct repressor of neuro-ectodermal gene zic3 during early Xenopus embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The activation of liver X receptor (LXR) promotes cholesterol efflux and repression of inflammatory genes with anti-atherogenic consequences. The mechanisms underlying the repressive activity of LXR are controversial and have been attributed to cholesterol efflux or to transrepression of activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity. Here, we find that cholesterol efflux contributes to LXR repression, while the direct repressive functions of LXR also play a key role but are independent of AP-1. We use assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to show that LXR reduces chromatin accessibility in cis at inflammatory gene enhancers containing LXR binding sites. Targets of this repressive activity are associated with leukocyte adhesion and neutrophil migration, and LXR agonist treatment suppresses neutrophil recruitment in a mouse model of sterile peritonitis. These studies suggest a model of repression in which liganded LXR binds in cis to canonical nuclear receptor binding sites and represses pro-atherogenic leukocyte functions in tandem with the induction of LXR targets mediating cholesterol efflux.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are embryonically seeded macrophages that contribute to brain development, homeostasis, and pathologies. It is thus essential to decipher how microglial properties are temporally regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as sexual identity and the microbiome. Here, we found that microglia undergo differentiation phases, discernable by transcriptomic signatures and chromatin accessibility landscapes, which can diverge in adult males and females. Remarkably, the absence of microbiome in germ-free mice had a time and sexually dimorphic impact both prenatally and postnatally: microglia were more profoundly perturbed in male embryos and female adults. Antibiotic treatment of adult mice triggered sexually biased microglial responses revealing both acute and long-term effects of microbiota depletion. Finally, human fetal microglia exhibited significant overlap with the murine transcriptomic signature. Our study shows that microglia respond to environmental challenges in a sex- and time-dependent manner from prenatal stages, with major implications for our understanding of microglial contributions to health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular- and cellular-based therapies have the potential to reduce obesity-associated disease. In response to cold, beige adipocytes form in subcutaneous white adipose tissue and convert energy stored in metabolic substrates to heat, making them an attractive therapeutic target. We developed a robust method to generate a renewable source of human beige adipocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Developmentally, these cells are derived from FOXF1+ mesoderm and progress through an expandable mural-like mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) to form mature beige adipocytes that display a thermogenically active profile. This includes expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) concomitant with increased uncoupled respiration. With this method, dysfunctional adipogenic precursors can be reprogrammed and differentiated into beige adipocytes with increased thermogenic function and anti-diabetic secretion potential. This resource can be used to (1) elucidate mechanisms that underlie the control of beige adipogenesis and (2) generate material for cellular-based therapies that target metabolic syndrome in humans.

Both innate and adaptive immune cells are involved in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity is largely unknown. Here we show that compared with WT mice, OX40−/− mice exhibit decreased liver fat accumulation, lobular inflammation, and focal necrosis after feeding with diets that induce NASH. Mechanistically, OX40 deficiency suppresses Th1 and Th17 differentiation, and OX40 deficiency in T cells inhibits monocyte migration, antigen presentation, and M1 polarization. Soluble OX40 stimulation alone upregulates antigen presentation, chemokine receptor expression, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion by liver monocytes. Furthermore, plasma soluble OX40 levels are positively associated with NASH in humans, suggesting clinical relevance of the findings. In conclusion, we show a mechanism for T cell regulation of innate immune cells. OX40 is a key regulator of both intrahepatic innate and adaptive immunity, generates two-way signals, and promotes both proinflammatory monocyte and macrophage and T cell function, resulting in NASH development.

Abstract: Summary
Functions of many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) depend on their ability to interact with multiple copies of specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Here, we devised a workflow combining bioinformatics and experimental validation steps to systematically identify RNAs capable of multivalent RBP recruitment. This uncovered a number of previously unknown transcripts encoding high-density RBP recognition arrays within genetically normal short tandem repeats. We show that a top-scoring hit in this screen, lncRNA PNCTR, contains hundreds of pyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1)-specific motifs allowing it to sequester a substantial fraction of PTBP1 in a nuclear body called perinucleolar compartment. Importantly, PNCTR is markedly overexpressed in a variety of cancer cells and its downregulation is sufficient to induce programmed cell death at least in part by stimulating PTBP1 splicing regulation activity. This work expands our understanding of the repeat-containing fraction of the human genome and illuminates a novel mechanism driving malignant transformation of cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) are the first embryonic progenitors in the germ cell lineage, yet the molecular mechanisms required for hPGC formation are not well characterized. To identify regulatory regions in hPGC development, we used the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to systematically characterize regions of open chromatin in hPGCs and hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We discovered regions of open chromatin unique to hPGCs and hPGCLCs that significantly overlap with TFAP2C-bound enhancers identified in the naive ground state of pluripotency. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we show that deleting the TFAP2C-bound naive enhancer at the OCT4 locus (also called POU5F1) results in impaired OCT4 expression and a negative effect on hPGCLC identity.

Abstract: Summary
There is a considerable need to identify those individuals with prostate cancer who have indolent disease. We propose that genes that control adult stem cell homeostasis in organs with slow turnover, such as the prostate, control cancer fate. One such gene, KLF4, overexpressed in murine prostate stem cells, regulates their homeostasis, blocks malignant transformation, and controls the self-renewal of tumor-initiating cells. KLF4 loss induces the molecular features of aggressive cancer and converts PIN lesions to invasive sarcomatoid carcinomas; its re-expression in vivo reverses this process. Bioinformatic analysis links these changes to human cancer. KLF4 and its downstream targets make up a gene signature that identifies indolent tumors and predicts recurrence-free survival. This approach may improve prognosis and identify therapeutic targets for advanced cancer.

Long-Term Memory Engram Cells Are Established by c-Fos/CREB Transcriptional Cycling,

Abstract: Summary
Training-dependent increases in c-fos have been used to identify engram cells encoding long-term memories (LTMs). However, the interaction between transcription factors required for LTM, including CREB and c-Fos, and activating kinases such as phosphorylated ERK (pERK) in the establishment of memory engrams has been unclear. Formation of LTM of an aversive olfactory association in flies requires repeated training trials with rest intervals between trainings. Here, we find that prolonged rest interval-dependent increases in pERK induce transcriptional cycling between c-Fos and CREB in a subset of KCs in the mushroom bodies, where olfactory associations are made and stored. Preexisting CREB is required for initial c-fos induction, while c-Fos is required later to increase CREB expression. Blocking or activating c-fos-positive engram neurons inhibits memory recall or induces memory-associated behaviors. Our results suggest that c-Fos/CREB cycling defines LTM engram cells required for LTM.
