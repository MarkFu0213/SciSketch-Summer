Abstract: Summary
Poxvirus replication involves synthesis of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which can trigger antiviral responses by inducing phosphorylation-mediated activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and stimulating 2′5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS). PKR inactivates the translation initiation factor eIF2α via phosphorylation, while OAS induces the endonuclease RNase L to degrade RNA. We show that poxvirus decapping enzymes D9 and D10, which remove caps from mRNAs, inhibit these antiviral responses by preventing dsRNA accumulation. Catalytic site mutations of D9 and D10, but not of either enzyme alone, halt vaccinia virus late protein synthesis and inhibit virus replication. Infection with the D9-D10 mutant was accompanied by massive mRNA reduction, cleavage of ribosomal RNA, and phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2α that correlated with a ∼15-fold increase in dsRNA compared to wild-type virus. Additionally, mouse studies show extreme attenuation of the mutant virus. Thus, vaccinia virus decapping, in addition to targeting mRNAs for degradation, prevents dsRNA accumulation and anti-viral responses.

Abstract: The transition zone (TZ) at the ciliary base has emerged as an important regulator of the composition and functions of cilia, which are microtubule-based structures extending from the surfaces of most eukaryotic cells, serving motility, chemo-/mechano-/photosensation and developmental signaling roles. Possessing distinct ultrastructural features such as microtubule-membrane spanning Y-links, the ∼0.2–1.0-μm long TZ is thought to act as a gated cytosolic (size dependent) and membrane diffusion barrier that drives ciliary compartmentalization by preventing unregulated protein exchange between the cilium and the rest of the cell. Multiple proteins associated with ciliary diseases (ciliopathies) such as Meckel–Gruber syndrome (MKS) and nephronophthisis are specifically found in the TZ, and work from a number of model systems, including Chlamydomonas reinharditii, Caenorhabditis elegans and the mouse indicates TZ-gating and associated ciliogenic functions for a number of these proteins. Here we present a suite of assays for probing the structure, function, and molecular composition of the C. elegans TZ, with emphasis on TZ ultrastructure, diffusion barrier kinetics, MKS module assembly hierarchy, and TZ-dependent behaviors.

Abstract: Cells usually grow to a certain size before they divide. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an established model to dissect the molecular control of cell size homeostasis and cell cycle. In this chapter, we describe two simple methods to: (1) precisely compute geometrical parameters (cell length, diameter, surface, and volume) of single growing and dividing fission yeast cells with image analysis scripts and (2) manipulate cell diameter with microfabricated chambers and assess for cell size at division. We demonstrate the strength of these approaches in the context of growing spores, which constantly change size and shape and in deriving allometric relationships between cell geometrical parameters associated with G2/M transition. We emphasize these methods to be useful to investigate problems of growth, size, and division in fungal or bacterial cells.

Abstract: Ion channels that are located on intracellular organelles have always posed challenges for biophysicists seeking to measure their ion conduction, selectivity, and gating kinetics. Unlike cell surface ion channels, intracellular ion channels cannot be accessed for biophysical single-channel recordings using the patch-clamp technique while remaining in a physiological setting. Disruption of the cell is always necessary and hence experiments inevitably have a certain “artificial” nature about them. This drawback is turned to considerable advantage if the internal membranes containing the channels of interest can be isolated or if the channels can be purified because they can then be incorporated into artificial membranes of controlled composition. This approach guarantees a tight but flexible control over the biophysical and biochemical environment of the ion channel molecules. This includes the lipid composition of the membrane and the ionic solutions on both sides of the channel, thus allowing the conductance properties of the channel to be accurately measured. Since the influence of multiple unknown regulators of channel function (that could be present within the physiological membrane or in cytosolic, or intraorganelle compartments) is removed, the identification and characterization of physiological and pharmacological regulators that directly affect channel gating can also be achieved. This cannot be performed in a cellular environment. These techniques have typically been used to study the properties of channels located on endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) membranes but in this chapter we describe how the techniques are also suited for ion channels of the acidic lysosomal and endolysosomal Ca2+ stores.

Abstract: PeBoW, a trimeric complex consisting of pescadillo (Pes1), block of proliferation (Bop1), and the WD repeat protein 12 (WDR12), is essential for processing and maturation of mammalian 5.8S and 28S ribosomal RNAs. Applying a mass spectrometric analysis, we identified the DEAD-box helicase DDX27 as stably associated factor of the PeBoW-complex. DDX27 interacts with the PeBoW-complex via an evolutionary conserved F×F motif in the N-terminal domain and is recruited to the nucleolus via its basic C-terminal domain. This recruitment is RNA-dependent and occurs independently of the PeBoW-complex. Interestingly, knockdown of DDX27, but not of Pes1, induces the accumulation of an extended form of the primary 47S rRNA. We conclude that DDX27 can interact specifically with the Pes1 and Bop1 but fulfils critical function(s) for proper 3′ end formation of 47S rRNA independently of the PeBoW-complex.

Abstract: Kidney transplantation is the major therapeutic option for end-stage kidney diseases. However, acute rejection could cause allograft loss in some of these patients. Emerging evidence supports that microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation is implicated in acute allograft rejection. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to profile miRNA expression in normal and acutely rejected kidney allografts. Among 75 identified dysregulated miRNAs, miR-10b was the most significantly downregulated miRNAs in rejected allografts. Transfecting miR-10b inhibitor into human renal glomerular endothelial cells recapitulated key features of acute allograft rejection, including endothelial cell apoptosis, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor α, interferon-γ, and chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2) and chemotaxis of macrophages whereas transfection of miR-10b mimics had opposite effects. Downregulation of miR-10b directly derepressed the expression of BCL2L11 (an apoptosis inducer) as revealed by luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, miR-10b downregulation mediates many aspects of disease pathogenicity of acute kidney allograft rejection. Restoring miR-10b expression in glomerular endothelial cells could be a novel therapeutic approach to reduce acute renal allograft loss.

Abstract: The primary cilium is a protrusion from the cell surface that serves as a specialized compartment for signal transduction. Many signaling factors are known to be dynamically concentrated within cilia and to require cilia for their function. Yet protein entry into primary cilia remains poorly understood. To enable a mechanistic analysis of soluble protein entry into cilia, we developed a method for semipermeabilization of mammalian cells in which the plasma membrane is permeabilized while the ciliary membrane remains intact. Using semipermeabilized cells as the basis for an in vitro diffusion-to-capture assay, we uncovered a size-dependent diffusion barrier that restricts soluble protein exchange between the cytosol and the cilium. The manipulability of this in vitro system enabled an extensive characterization of the ciliary diffusion barrier and led us to show that the barrier is mechanistically distinct from those at the axon initial segment and the nuclear pore complex. Because semipermeabilized cells enable a range of experimental perturbations that would not be easily feasible in intact cells, we believe this methodology will provide a unique resource for investigating primary cilium function in development and disease.

Abstract: Summary
The application of cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine is gaining recognition. Here, we show that human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), also known as bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal cells, can be reprogrammed into renal proximal tubular-like epithelial cells using cell-free extracts. Streptolysin-O-permeabilized BMSCs exposed to HK2-cell extracts underwent morphological changes—formation of “domes” and tubule-like structures—and acquired epithelial functional properties such as transepithelial-resistance, albumin-binding, and uptake and specific markers E-cadherin and aquaporin-1. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of brush border microvilli and tight intercellular contacts. RNA sequencing showed tubular epithelial transcript abundance and revealed the upregulation of components of the EGFR pathway. Reprogrammed BMSCs integrated into self-forming kidney tissue and formed tubular structures. Reprogrammed BMSCs infused in immunodeficient mice with cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury engrafted into proximal tubuli, reduced renal injury and improved function. Thus, reprogrammed BMSCs are a promising cell resource for future cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Podocyte loss is a general mechanism of glomerular dysfunction that initiates and drives the progression of chronic kidney disease, which affects 10% of the world population. Here, we evaluate whether the regenerative response to podocyte injury influences chronic kidney disease outcome. In models of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis performed in inducible transgenic mice where podocytes are tagged, remission or progression of disease was determined by the amount of regenerated podocytes. When the same model was established in inducible transgenic mice where renal progenitors are tagged, the disease remitted if renal progenitors successfully differentiated into podocytes, while it persisted if differentiation was ineffective, resulting in glomerulosclerosis. Treatment with BIO, a GSK3s inhibitor, significantly increased disease remission by enhancing renal progenitor sensitivity to the differentiation effect of endogenous retinoic acid. These results establish renal progenitors as critical determinants of glomerular disease outcome and a pharmacological enhancement of their differentiation as a possible therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma responses weakly to cisplatin. Mitochondrial dynamics participate in the response to various stresses, and mainly involve mitophagy and mitochondrial fusion and fission. Bcl-2 family proteins play critical roles in orchestrating mitochondrial dynamics, and are involved in the resistance to cisplatin. Here we reported that ABT737, combined with cisplatin, can promote cholangiocarcinoma cells to undergo apoptosis. We found that the combined treatment decreased the Mcl-1 pro-survival form and increased Bak. Cells undergoing cisplatin treatment showed hyperfused mitochondria, whereas fragmentation was dominant in the mitochondria of cells exposed to the combined treatment, with higher Fis1 levels, decreased Mfn2 and OPA1 levels, increased ratio of Drp1 60kD to 80kD form, and more Drp1 located on mitochondria. More p62 aggregates were observed in cells with fragmented mitochondria, and they gradually translocated to mitochondria. Mitophagy was induced by the combined treatment. Knockdown p62 decreased the Drp1 ratio, increased Tom20, and increased cell viability. Our data indicated that mitochondrial dynamics play an important role in the response of cholangiocarcinoma to cisplatin. ABT737 might enhance cholangiocarcinoma sensitivity to cisplatin through regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and the balance within Bcl-2 family proteins. Furthermore, p62 seems to be critical in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
The host immune system functions constantly to maintain chronic commensal and pathogenic organisms in check. The consequences of these immune responses on host physiology are as yet unexplored, and may have long-term implications in health and disease. We show that chronic viral infection increases epithelial turnover in multiple tissues, and the antiviral cytokines type I interferons (IFNs) mediate this response. Using a murine model with persistently elevated type I IFNs in the absence of exogenous viral infection, the Irgm1−/− mouse, we demonstrate that type I IFNs act through nonepithelial cells, including macrophages, to promote increased epithelial turnover and wound repair. Downstream of type I IFN signaling, the highly related IFN-stimulated genes Apolipoprotein L9a and b activate epithelial proliferation through ERK activation. Our findings demonstrate that the host immune response to chronic viral infection has systemic effects on epithelial turnover through a myeloid-epithelial circuit.

Abstract: Summary
Systemic and local signals must be integrated by mammary stem and progenitor cells to regulate their cyclic growth and turnover in the adult gland. Here, we show RANK-positive luminal progenitors exhibiting WNT pathway activation are selectively expanded in the human breast during the progesterone-high menstrual phase. To investigate underlying mechanisms, we examined mouse models and found that loss of RANK prevents the proliferation of hormone receptor-negative luminal mammary progenitors and basal cells, an accompanying loss of WNT activation, and, hence, a suppression of lobuloalveologenesis. We also show that R-spondin1 is depleted in RANK-null progenitors, and that its exogenous administration rescues key aspects of RANK deficiency by reinstating a WNT response and mammary cell expansion. Our findings point to a novel role of RANK in dictating WNT responsiveness to mediate hormone-induced changes in the growth dynamics of adult mammary cells.

Abstract: Background and purpose
Angiotensin II is a vaso-constrictive peptide that regulates blood pressure homeostasis. Even though the inflammatory effects of AngII in renal pathophysiology have been studied, there still exists a paucity of data with regard to the mechanism of action of AngII-mediated kidney injury. The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanistic role of HMGB1-TLR4 signaling in AngII-induced inflammation in the kidney.
Experimental approach
Rat tubular epithelial cells (NRK52E) were treated with AngII over a preset time-course. In another set of experiments, HMGB1 was neutralized and TLR4 was knocked down using small interfering RNA targeting TLR4. Cell extracts were subjected to RT-PCR, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and ELISA.
Key results
AngII-induced inflammation in NRK52E cells increased gene and protein expression of TLR4, HMGB1 and key proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL1β). Pretreatment with Losartan (an AT1 receptor blocker) attenuated the AngII-induced expression of TLR4 and inflammatory cytokines. TLR4 silencing was used to elucidate the specific role played by TLR4 in AngII-induced inflammation. TLR4siRNA treatment in these cells significantly decreased the AngII-induced inflammatory effect. Consistent observations were made when the Ang II treated cells were pretreated with anti-HMGB1. Downstream activation of NFκB and rate of generation of ROS was also decreased on gene silencing of TLR4 and exposure to anti-HMGB1.
Conclusions and implications
These results indicate a key role for HMGB1-TLR4 signaling in AngII-mediated inflammation in the renal epithelial cells. Our data also reveal that AngII-induced effects could be alleviated by HMGB1-TLR4 inhibition, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target for hypertensive renal dysfunctions.

Abstract: Cargo export from mammalian endosomal compartments often involves membrane tubules, into which soluble and membrane-bound cargos are segregated for subsequent intracellular transport. These membrane tubules are highly dynamic and their formation is mediated by a variety of endosome-associated proteins. However, little is known about how these membrane tubules are temporally or spatially regulated, so other tubule-associated proteins are likely to be discovered and analyzed. Therefore, methods to examine the biogenesis and regulation of endosome membrane tubules will prove to be valuable for cell biologists. In this chapter, we describe methods for studying this process using both cell-free, in vitro reconstitution assays, and in vivo image analysis tools.

Abstract: Among the many immunomodulatory and anti-tumor activities, IFN-γ up-regulates tumor cell death mediated by Fas receptor (FasR). Our and several other studies have demonstrated the involvement of trypsin-like proteases (TLPs) in the mode of action of IFN-γ. In the present study, we tried to unravel the role of serine proteases in IFN-γ induced Fas-mediated cell death. Our present results show that both tosyl-l-Lysine chloromethylketone (TLCK), a trypsin like protease inhibitor and tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone (TPCK) – a chymotrypsin like protease (CLP) inhibitor, sensitize HeLa cells to Fas-mediated cell death. The combined effect of these protease inhibitors with anti-Fas was stronger than additive. In contrast, elastase inhibitor III (EI), which also contains the chloromethyl ketone moiety, was not active. Furthermore, co-addition of TLCK or TPCK with IFN-γ markedly enhanced Fas-induced cell death. IFN-γ led to up-regulation of FasR on its own, which was further enhanced by the co-addition of TLCK or TPCK. This was evident both by increased expression of Fas receptor on cell surface and by elevated Fas mRNA level. This study may provide the basis for the design of a novel combinatory therapeutic strategy that could enhance the eradication of tumors.

Abstract: This case-control study aimed to investigate whether the levels of Hsp70 (HSPA1A) and Hsp27 (HSPB1) in plasma and lymphocytes were associated with the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) among coal workers. A total of 76 COPD cases and 48 age-matched healthy controls from a group of coal workers were included. The case group consisted of 35 COPD patients whose condition was complicated with coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) and 41 COPD patients without CWP. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) in plasma and lymphocytes were detected by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. Multiple logistic regression models were applied to estimate the association between Hsp levels and COPD risk. Our results showed that plasma Hsp70 and lymphocyte Hsp27 levels were significantly higher and plasma Hsp27 levels were significantly lower in COPD cases than in controls (p < 0.01). No significant differences in lymphocyte Hsp70 levels were found between COPD cases and the matched subjects. Higher plasma Hsp70 levels (odds ratio (OR) = 13.8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 5.7–33.5) and lower plasma Hsp27 levels (OR = 4.6, 95 % CI = 2.0–10.5) were significantly associated with an increased risk of COPD after adjusting for confounders. Higher lymphocyte Hsp27 levels were only associated with an increased risk of COPD with CWP (OR = 6.6, 95 % CI = 2.0–22.1) but not with an increased risk of COPD without CWP (OR = 3.0, 95 % CI = 0.9–8.9). Additionally, there were strong joint effects of different Hsps on COPD risk. These results showed that higher levels of plasma Hsp70 and lower levels of plasma Hsp27 might be associated with an increased risk of COPD among coal workers. They may have the potential to serve as monitoring markers for COPD in coal workers.

Abstract: Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a key role in the dense desmoplastic stroma associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Studies on human PSCs have been minimal due to difficulty in maintaining primary PSC in culture. We have generated the first conditionally immortalized human non-tumor (NPSC) and tumor-derived (TPSC) pancreatic stellate cells via transformation with the temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen and human telomerase (hTERT). These cells proliferate at 33°C. After transfer to 37°C, the SV40LT is switched off and the cells regain their primary PSC phenotype and growth characteristics. NPSC contained cytoplasmic vitamin A-storing lipid droplets, while both NPSC and TPSC expressed the characteristic markers αSMA, vimentin, desmin and GFAP. Proteome array analysis revealed that of the 55 evaluated proteins, 27 (49%) were upregulated ≥3-fold in TPSC compared to NPSC, including uPA, pentraxin-3, endoglin and endothelin-1. Two insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) were inversely expressed. Although discordant IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 levels, IGF-I was found to stimulate proliferation of both NPSC and TPSC. Both basal and IGF-I stimulated motility was significantly enhanced in TPSC compared to NPSC. In conclusion, these cells provide a unique resource that will facilitate further study of the active stroma compartment associated with pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: Cell motility is an important phenomenon in cell biology, developmental biology, and cancer. Here we report methods that we designed to identify and characterize external factors which direct cell motions by breaking locally the symmetry. We used microfabrication and microfluidics techniques to impose and combine mechanical and chemical cues to moving fibroblasts. Gradients can thereby be engineered at the cellular scale and this approach has allowed to disentangle roles of the nucleus and protrusion activity in setting cell directions.

JAZF1 promotes proliferation of C2C12 cells, but retards their myogenic differentiation through transcriptional repression of MEF2C and MRF4—Implications for the role of Jazf1 variants in oncogenesis and type 2 diabetes,

Abstract: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been identified in Jazf1, which is also involved in the oncogenesis of endometrial stromal tumors. To understand how Jazf1 variants confer a risk of tumorigenesis and T2D, we explored the functional roles of JAZF1 and searched for JAZF1 target genes in myogenic C2C12 cells. Consistent with an increase of Jazf1 transcripts during myoblast proliferation and their decrease during myogenic differentiation in regenerating skeletal muscle, JAZF1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation, whereas it retarded myogenic differentiation. Examination of myogenic genes revealed that JAZF1 overexpression transcriptionally repressed MEF2C and MRF4 and their downstream genes. AMP deaminase1 (AMPD1) was identified as a candidate for JAZF1 target by gene array analysis. However, promoter assays of Ampd1 demonstrated that mutation of the putative binding site for the TR4/JAZF1 complex did not alleviate the repressive effects of JAZF1 on promoter activity. Instead, JAZF1-mediated repression of Ampd1 occurred through the MEF2-binding site and E-box within the Ampd1 proximal regulatory elements. Consistently, MEF2C and MRF4 expression enhanced Ampd1 promoter activity. AMPD1 overexpression and JAZF1 downregulation impaired AMPK phosphorylation, while JAZF1 overexpression also reduced it. Collectively, these results suggest that aberrant JAZF1 expression contributes to the oncogenesis and T2D pathogenesis.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a commonly encountered emergency and severe neurosurgical injury. Previous studies have shown that the presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele has adverse outcomes across the spectrum of TBI severity. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of APOE alleles on trauma induced early apoptosis via modification of delayed rectifier K+ current (Ik(DR)) in neuronal/glial co-cultures model. An ex vivo neuronal/glial co-cultures model carrying individual APOE alleles (ε2, ε3, ε4) of mechanical injury was developed. Flow cytometry and patch clamp recording were performed to analyze the correlations among APOE genotypes, early apoptosis and Ik(DR). We found that APOEε4 increased early apoptosis at 24h (p<0.05) compared to the ones transfected with APOEε3 and APOEε2. Noticeably, APOEε4 significantly reduced the amplitude of the Ik(DR) at 24h compared to the APOEε3 and APOEε2 (p<0.05) which exacerbate Ca2+ influx. This indicates a possible effect of APOEε4 on early apoptosis via inhibiting Ik(DR) following injury which may adversely affect the outcome of TBI.

Abstract: Our previous study showed that PLCD1 significantly decreases cell proliferation and affects cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to investigate its functional and molecular mechanisms, and whether or not can become a new target for gene therapies. We found reduced PLCD1 protein expression in breast tumor tissues compared with paired surgical margin tissues. PLCD1 promoter CpG methylation was detected in 55 of 96 (57%) primary breast tumors, but not in surgical-margin tissues and normal breast tissues. Ectopic expression of PLCD1 inhibited breast tumor cell proliferation in vivo by inducing apoptosis and suppressed tumor cell migration by regulating cytoskeletal reorganization proteins including RhoA and phospho-cofilin. Furthermore, we found that PLCD1 induced p53 accumulation, increased p27 and p21 protein levels, and cleaved PARP. Finally, we constructed an adenoviral vector expressing PLCD1 (AdH5-PLCD1), which exhibited strong cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells. Our findings provide insights into the development of PLCD1 gene therapies for breast cancer and perhaps, other human cancers.

Abstract: Although 17β-estradial (E2) is known to stimulate bone formation, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent studies have implicated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a major signaling cascade in bone biology. The interactions between Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and estrogen signaling pathways have been reported in many tissues. In this study, E2 significantly increased the expression of β-catenin by inducing phosphorylations of GSK3β at serine 9. ERβ siRNAs were transfected into MC3T3-E1 cells and revealed that ERβ involved E2-induced osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation via Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The osteoblast differentiation genes (BGP, ALP and OPN) and proliferation related gene (cyclin D1) expression were significantly induced by E2-mediated ERβ. Furthermore immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that E2 induced the accumulation of β-catenin protein in the nucleus which leads to interaction with T-cell-specific transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors. Taken together, these findings suggest that E2 promotes osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation by inducing proliferation-related and differentiation-related gene expression via ERβ/GSK-3β-dependent Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of action of E2 in osteoblastogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a health concern due to its ability to enter a non-replicative dormant state linked to drug resistance. Understanding transitions into and out of dormancy will inform therapeutic strategies. We implemented a universally applicable, label-free approach to estimate absolute cellular protein concentrations on a proteome-wide scale based on SWATH mass spectrometry. We applied this approach to examine proteomic reorganization of M. tuberculosis during exponential growth, hypoxia-induced dormancy, and resuscitation. The resulting data set covering >2,000 proteins reveals how protein biomass is distributed among cellular functions during these states. The stress-induced DosR regulon contributes 20% to cellular protein content during dormancy, whereas ribosomal proteins remain largely unchanged at 5%–7%. Absolute protein concentrations furthermore allow protein alterations to be translated into changes in maximal enzymatic reaction velocities, enhancing understanding of metabolic adaptations. Thus, global absolute protein measurements provide a quantitative description of microbial states, which can support the development of therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Malaria eradication is a major goal in public health but is challenged by relapsing malaria species, expanding drug resistance, and the influence of host genetics on antimalarial drug efficacy. To overcome these hurdles, it is imperative to establish in vitro assays of liver-stage malaria for drug testing. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) potentially allow the assessment of donor-specific drug responses, and iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells (iHLCs) can facilitate the study of host genetics on host-pathogen interactions and the discovery of novel targets for antimalarial drug development. We establish in vitro liver-stage malaria infections in iHLCs using P. berghei, P. yoelii, P. falciparum, and P. vivax and show that differentiating cells acquire permissiveness to malaria infection at the hepatoblast stage. We also characterize antimalarial drug metabolism capabilities of iHLCs using prototypical antimalarial drugs and demonstrate that chemical maturation of iHLCs can improve their potential for antimalarial drug testing applications.

Abstract: During embryonic development, oral ectoderm differentiates into the adenohypophysis, dental epithelia, salivary glands, and nasal pit. Few reports exist concerning the induction of oral ectoderm from embryonic stem (ES) cells. Generally, any lot differences in fetal bovine serum (FBS) and serum replacer may affect the induction of ES cell-differentiation. Using a previously established culture strategy for differentiation, the proportion of cell aggregates containing Pitx1+ oral ectoderm varied widely between 9–36% when several different lots of FBS or serum replacer were used. We therefore tried to enhance the differentiation method. We found that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) treatments improved oral ectoderm induction. Such treatment also improved the differentiation of oral ectoderm into the adenohypophysis. Furthermore, increased BMP4 treatment induced dental epithelium and mesenchyme. Such differentiation suggests that the Pitx1+ layer displays similar properties to oral ectoderm, as found in vivo. Differentiation of ES cells into oral ectoderm using different lots of FBS and serum replacer increased 78–90% after treatment with BMP4 and FGF. In summary, we have established a robust strategy for the induction of oral ectoderm differentiation from mouse ES cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) defends itself against host immunity and chemotherapy at several levels, including the repair or degradation of irreversibly oxidized proteins (IOPs). To investigate how Mtb deals with IOPs that can neither be repaired nor degraded, we used new chemical and biochemical probes and improved image analysis algorithms for time-lapse microscopy to reveal a defense against stationary phase stress, oxidants, and antibiotics—the sequestration of IOPs into aggregates in association with the chaperone ClpB, followed by the asymmetric distribution of aggregates within bacteria and between their progeny. Progeny born with minimal IOPs grew faster and better survived a subsequent antibiotic stress than their IOP-burdened sibs. ClpB-deficient Mtb had a marked recovery defect from stationary phase or antibiotic exposure and survived poorly in mice. Treatment of tuberculosis might be assisted by drugs that cripple the pathway by which Mtb buffers, sequesters, and asymmetrically distributes IOPs.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures have long been recognized as a tool for the study of tissue architecture, polarity, and invasion. However, only recently these systems have been used to study centrosome and cilia functions. Studying these organelles in 3D cultures has elucidated new functions that otherwise would have been overlooked, demonstrating the value of these experimental systems to the field. Here we describe a culture method to study mammary epithelial cells in a 3D environment.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) has recently been recognized to harbor therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of HCC, but it remains controversial as to whether IFN-α exerts direct cytotoxicity against HCC. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is overexpressed in HCC and is considered to play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the combined effect of a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, and IFN-α on in vitro growth suppression of HCC using the hepatoma cell line HLCZ01 and the in vivo nude mouse xenotransplantation model using HLCZ01 cells. Treatment with celecoxib and IFN-α synergistically inhibited cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Apoptosis was identified by 4׳,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride and fluorescent staining. IFN-α upregulated the expression of TRAIL, while celecoxib increased the expression of TRAIL receptors. The combined regimen with celecoxib and IFN-α reduced the growth of xenotransplanted HCCs in nude mice. The regulation of IFN-α- and COX-2 inhibitor-induced cell death is impaired in a subset of TRAIL-resistant cells. The molecular mechanisms of HCC cells resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis were explored using molecular biological and immunological methods. Interferon-α and the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib synergistically increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. These data suggest that IFN-α and celecoxib may offer a novel role with important implications in designing new therapeutics for TRAIL-resistant tumors.

Abstract: The endocytic pathway is composed of distinct types of endosomes that vary in shape, function, and molecular composition. In addition, endosomes are highly dynamic structures that continuously receive, sort, and deliver molecules to other organelles. Among organizing machineries that contribute to endosomal functions, Rab GTPases and kinesin motors play critical roles. Rab proteins define the identity of endosomal subdomains by recruiting set of effectors among which kinesins shape and transport membranous carriers along the microtubule network. In this review, we provide detailed protocols from live cell imaging to electron microscopy and biochemical approaches to address how Rab and kinesin proteins cooperate molecularly and functionally within the endocytic pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). We have previously generated FXS-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients’ fibroblasts. In this study, we aimed at unraveling the molecular phenotype of the disease. Our data revealed aberrant regulation of neural differentiation and axon guidance genes in FXS-derived neurons, which are regulated by the RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST). Moreover, we found REST to be elevated in FXS-derived neurons. As FMRP is involved in the microRNA (miRNA) pathway, we employed miRNA-array analyses and uncovered several miRNAs dysregulated in FXS-derived neurons. We found hsa-mir-382 to be downregulated in FXS-derived neurons, and introduction of mimic-mir-382 into these neurons was sufficient to repress REST and upregulate its axon guidance target genes. Our data link FMRP and REST through the miRNA pathway and show a new aspect in the development of FXS.

Abstract: Skeletal and heart muscle-specific variant of the alpha subunit of nascent polypeptide associated complex (skNAC) is exclusively found in striated muscle cells. Its function, however, is largely unknown. Previous reports could demonstrate that skNAC binds to Smyd1 (SET and MYND domain containing protein 1). The facts that (a) SET domains have histone methyltransferase activity, and (b) MYND domains are known recruiters of histone deacetylases (HDACs), implicate the skNAC–Smyd1 complex in transcriptional control. To study potential target genes, we carried out cDNA microarray analysis on differentiating C2C12 myoblasts in which expression of the skNAC gene had been knocked down. We found and confirmed a series of targets, specifically genes encoding regulators of inflammation, cellular metabolism, and cell migration. Mechanistically, as shown by Western blot, ELISA, and ChIP analysis at selected promoter regions, transcriptional control by skNAC–Smyd1 appears to be exerted at least in part by affecting a series of histone modifications, specifically H3K4 di- and trimethylation and potentially also histone acetylation. Taken together, our data suggest that the skNAC–Smyd1 complex is involved in transcriptional regulation both via the control of histone methylation and histone (de)acetylation.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can survive long-term in a state of dormancy. Little is known about how histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) affect HSC kinetics. Here, we use trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, to enforce histone acetylation and show that this suppresses cell cycle entry by dormant HSCs. Previously, we found that haploinsufficiency of PSF1, a DNA replication factor, led to attenuation of the bone marrow (BM) HSC pool size and lack of acute proliferation after 5-FU ablation. Because PSF1 protein is present in CD34+ transiently amplifying HSCs but not in CD34− long-term reconstituting-HSCs which are resting in a dormant state, we analyzed the relationship between dormancy and PSF1 expression, and how a histone deacetylase inhibitor affects this. We found that CD34+ HSCs produce long functional PSF1 (PSF1a) but CD34− HSCs produce a shorter possibly non-functional PSF1 (PSF1b, c, dominantly PSF1c). Using PSF1a-overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells in which the endogenous PSF1 promoter is suppressed, we found that TSA treatment promotes production of the shorter form of PSF1 possibly by inducing recruitment of E2F family factors upstream of the PSF1 transcription start site. Our data document one mechanism by which histone deacetylase inhibitors affect the dormancy of HSCs by regulating the DNA replication factor PSF1.

Abstract: In mammalian cells, lysosomes fuse with late endosomes to form endolysosomes from which lysosomes are reformed. Lysosomal fusion events were initially inferred from light and electron microscopy studies, demonstrated in cell-free content mixing assays and, more recently, shown directly with live cell microscopy. Currently, there is a focus on studying lysosome fusion in cultured cells using various forms of microscopy, especially under conditions in which the use of overexpression of dominant-negative protein constructs or the use of RNA interference to deplete individual proteins allows the investigation of the molecular machinery of fusion. Here, we review a variety of fluorescence, live cell, and electron microscopy techniques with which to study lysosome fusion in cultured mammalian cells. We address the merits and limitations of different techniques when choosing an assay system and provide a series of protocols with which to study endocytic delivery to lysosomes and fusion events between lysosomes and endosomes.

Abstract: Scope
Heterogeneity of breast cancer (BC) subtypes makes BC treatment difficult. α-linolenic acid (ALA), rich in flaxseed oil, has been shown to reduce growth and increase apoptosis in several BC cell lines, but the mechanism of action needs further understanding.
Methods and results
Four BC cell lines (MCF-7, BT-474, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) were incubated with 75μM ALA+1nM 17-β estradiol (E2) or 1nM E2 only (control) for 24h. MDA-MB-231 cells were additionally incubated at 6 and 12h. Viable cell number was measured, and expression of genes related to BC (signaling pathways, cell cycle, apoptosis) was quantified by real-time PCR array. There was a reduction in growth of all ALA treated cell lines after 24h, and in MDA-MB-231 cells this was time-dependent. Many genes were altered after 24h, and these differed between cell lines. In MDA-MB-231 cells, several gene expression changes were time-dependent.
Conclusions
ALA reduces growth of BC cell lines, by modifying signaling pathways, which differ between BC molecular subtypes. The ALA effect on gene expression is dynamic and changes over time, indicating the significance of incubation period in detecting gene changes.

Abstract: We previously reported the association of HSPA1A and HSPB1 with high-grade astrocytomas, suggesting that these proteins might be involved in disease outcome and response to treatment. With the aim to better understand the resistance/susceptibility processes associated to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment, the current study was performed in three human malignant glioma cell lines by focusing on several levels: (a) apoptotic index and senescence, (b) DNA damage, and (c) interaction of HSPB1 with players of the DNA damage response. Three human glioma cell lines, Gli36, U87, and DBTRG, were treated with TMZ evaluating cell viability and survival, apoptosis, senescence, and comets (comet assay). The expression of HSPA (HSPA1A and HSPA8), HSPB1, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), MLH1, and MSH2 was determined by immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. Immunoprecipitation was used to analyze protein interaction. The cell lines exhibited differences in viability, apoptosis, and senescence after TMZ administration. We then focused on Gli36 cells (relatively unstudied) which showed very low recovery capacity following TMZ treatment, and this was related to high DNA damage levels; however, the cells maintained their viability. In these cells, MGMT, MSH2, HSPA, and HSPB1 levels increased significantly after TMZ administration. In addition, MSH2 and HSPB1 proteins appeared co-localized by confocal microscopy. This co-localization increased after TMZ treatment, and in immunoprecipitation analysis, MSH2 and HSPB1 appeared interacting. In contrast, HSPB1 did not interact with MGMT. We show in glioma cells the biological effects of TMZ and how this drug affects the expression levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs), MGMT, MSH2, and MLH1. In Gli36 cells, the results suggest that interactions between HSPB1 and MSH2, including co-nuclear localization, may be important in determining cell sensitivity to TMZ.

Abstract: Thioredoxin peroxidase (Tpx), also named peroxiredoxin (Prx), is an important peroxidase that can protect organisms against stressful environments. AccTpx4, a 1-Cys thioredoxin peroxidase gene from the Chinese honey bee Apis cerana cerana, was cloned and characterized. The AccTpx4 gene encodes a protein that is predicted to contain the conserved PVCTTE motif from 1-Cys peroxiredoxin. Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) and Western blotting revealed that AccTpx4 was induced by various oxidative stresses, such as cold, heat, insecticides, H2O2, and HgCl2. The in vivo peroxidase activity assay showed that recombinant AccTpx4 protein could efficiently degrade H2O2 in the presence of DL-dithiothreitol (DTT). In addition, disc fusion assays revealed that AccTpx4 could function to protect cells against oxidative stresses. These results indicate that AccTpx4 plays an important role in oxidative stress responses and may contribute to the conservation of honeybees.

Abstract: In addition to organizing centrosomes, centrioles have an evolutionarily conserved role as basal bodies in the formation of cilia. The discovery of a range of human genetic disorders linked to cilia dysfunction has led to a resurgence of interest in this cellular organelle. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans possesses several unique features (highly stereotypical morphology, dispensability of cilia for organismal viability and fertility) that make it an attractive model to study cilia assembly and function. However, both the adult worm and the embryo present particular challenges for electron microscopy (EM), which remains the gold standard for high-resolution morphological studies. Here, we present a step-by-step guide for the ultrastructural analysis of C. elegans cilia, including optimized protocols for standard chemical fixation as well as high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution and further processing for serial-section transmission electron microscopy and electron tomography.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of in vivo repopulating hematopoietic cells from in vitro differentiating embryonic stem cells has remained a long-standing challenge. To date, hematopoietic engraftment has mostly been achieved through the enforced expression of ectopic transcription factors. Here, we describe serum-free culture conditions that allow the generation of in vivo repopulating hematopoietic cells in the absence of ectopically expressed factors. We show that repopulating activity arises immediately upon the commitment of mesodermal precursors to the blood program, within the first wave of hematopoietic specification. We establish that the formation of these progenitors is extremely transient and exquisitely sensitive to the cytokine milieu. Our findings define the precise differentiating stage at which hematopoietic repopulating activity first appears in vitro, and suggest that during embryonic stem cell differentiation, all hematopoietic programs are unraveled simultaneously from the mesoderm in the absence of cues that restrict the coordinated emergence of each lineage as is normally observed during embryogenesis.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been repeatedly implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The authors aimed to study applicability of heat shock protein 70 (HSPA1A) serum levels as a diagnostic factor and a severity indicator in patients with RA and to quantify cut-off point that predicts status of RA with highest specificity. A total of 76 patients with RA and 36 healthy adults were studied in this case-control analysis. Patients had a higher HSPA1A level than the control group (0.78±0.13 vs. 0.12±0.02 ng/mL, p = 0.006), irrespective of presence of absence of rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated cyclic peptide. Next, diagnostic accuracy of the HSPA1A in diagnosis of RA was evaluated (area under curve 0.71; p < 0.05). HSPA1A predicted status of having RA in levels above 0.42 ng/mL with more than 90 % specificity. In addition to diagnostic value, HSPA1A can distinguish between high disease activity (1.66±0.75 ng/mL) and low (0.49±0.1 ng/mL), moderate (0.52±0.12 ng/mL), or remission phase (0.48±0.11 ng/mL). Moreover, patients in remission still had a higher HSPA1A level compared to normal subject (0.48±0.11 vs. 0.12±0.02 ng/mL, p < 0.05). Our results showed that serum HSPA1A could be implemented as a specific tool to facilitate diagnosis and monitoring disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Abstract: The disease burden from diabetic kidney disease is large and growing. Effective therapies are lacking, despite an urgent need. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) activates Nrf2 and cellular antioxidant defenses; therefore, it may be generally useful for treating conditions that feature chronic oxidative tissue damage. Herein, we determined how periodic exposure to oxygen at elevated pressure affected type 2 diabetes mellitus-related changes in the kidneys of db/db mice. Two groups of db/db mice, designated 2.4 ATA and 1.5 ATA, were treated four times per week with 100 % oxygen at either 1.5 or 2.4 ATA (atmospheres absolute) followed by tests to assess kidney damage and function. The sham group of db/db mice and the Hets group of db/+ mice were handled but did not receive HBOT. Several markers of kidney damage were reduced significantly in the HBOT groups including urinary biomarkers neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and cystatin C (CyC) along with significantly lower levels of caspase-3 activity in kidney tissue extracts. Other stress biomarkers also showed trends to improvement in the HBOT groups, including urinary albumin levels. Expressions of the stress response genes NRF2, HMOX1, MT1, and HSPA1A were reduced in the HBOT groups at the end of the experiment, consistent with reduced kidney damage in treated mice. Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), a measure of albuminuria, was significantly reduced in the db/db mice receiving HBOT. All of the db/db mouse groups had qualitatively similar changes in renal histopathology. Glycogenated nuclei, not previously reported in db/db mice, were observed in these three experimental groups but not in the control group of nondiabetic mice. Overall, our findings are consistent with therapeutic HBOT alleviating stress and damage in the diabetic kidney through cytoprotective responses. These findings support an emerging paradigm in which tissue oxygenation and cellular defenses effectively limit damage from chronic oxidative stress more effectively than chemical antioxidants.

Abstract: One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides (Aβ) in senile plaques. Aβ-induced oxidative stress is believed to be responsible for degeneration and apoptosis of neurons and consequent cognitive and memory deficits. Here, we investigated the possible neuroprotective effect of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) against amyloid pathogenesis in adult male Wistar rats. GA or vehicle was injected into the lateral cerebral ventricles of rats 24 h before injection of Aβ (1–42) in CA1 area of hippocampus. The learning and memory of the rats were assessed 7 days after injection of Aβ using passive avoidance (PA) task. As potential contributing factors in Aβ-induced memory decline, we evaluated apoptotic markers and also used terminal-transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique to detect apoptosis in the hippocampus of Aβ-injected rats. Our behavioral data suggest that GA pretreatment can significantly suppress memory deficits in Aβ-injected rats. There was also not only a marked increase in Hsp70 level but also upregulated 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the hippocampus of GA-treated groups with a reduction in apoptotic factors including caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and TUNEL-positive cells as well. Thus, we conclude that GA exerts its protective effects against Aβ (1–42) toxicity and memory deficits, at least in part, by upregulating of Hsp70 and P70S6K.

Abstract: LIM homeobox transcription factor Lhx2 is known to be an important regulator of neuronal development, homeostasis of hair follicle stem cells, and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells; however, its function in skeletal muscle development is poorly understood. In this study, we found that overexpression of Lhx2 completely inhibits the myotube-forming capacity of C2C12 cells and primary myoblasts. The muscle dedifferentiation factors Msx1 and Msx2 were strongly induced by the Lhx2 overexpression. Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Lhx2 in the developing limb buds of mouse embryos resulted in a reduction in Msx1 and Msx2 mRNA levels, suggesting that they are downstream target genes of Lhx2. We found two Lhx2 consensus-binding sites in the −2097 to −1189 genomic region of Msx1 and two additional sites in the −536 to +73 genomic region of Msx2. These sequences were shown by luciferase reporter assay to be essential for Lhx2-mediated transcriptional activation. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Lhx2 is present in chromatin DNA complexes bound to the enhancer regions of the Msx1 and Msx2 genes. These data demonstrate that Msx1 and Msx2 are direct transcriptional targets of Lhx2. In addition, overexpression of Lhx2 significantly enhanced the mRNA levels of bone morphogenetic protein 4 and transforming growth factor beta family genes. We propose that Lhx2 is involved in the early stage of skeletal muscle development by inducing multiple differentiation inhibitory factors.

Abstract: Perivascular adipocyte (PVAC) proliferation and differentiation were closely involved in cardiovascular disease. We aimed to investigate whether phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways enhance PVAC functions activated by insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1) and suppressed by mesenchyme homeobox 2 (MEOX2). In this study, PVACs from primary culture were cultured and induced to differentiate. Cell viability assays demonstrated that IGF-1 promoted PVAC proliferation and differentiation. However MEOX2 counteracted these IGF-1-mediated actions. Flow Cytometry revealed that IGF-1 increased S phase cells and decreased apoptosis; however, MEOX2 decreased S phase cells, increased G0–G1 phase cells, and promoted apoptosis. During PVAC proliferation and differentiation, IGF-1 activated PI3K/Akt1/2 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, upregulated the expression of these signaling proteins and FAS, and increased PVAC lipid content. In contrast, MEOX2 constrained the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt1/2 protein, down-regulated these signaling molecules and FAS, and decreased PVAC lipid content. Instead, MEOX2 knockdown enhanced the ERK1/2 and Akt1/2 phosphorylation, augmented the expression of these signaling molecules and FAS, and increased PVAC lipid content. Our findings suggested that PI3K/Akt1/2 and ERK1/2 activation mediated by IGF-1 is essential for PVAC proliferation and differentiation, and MEOX2 is a promising therapeutic gene to intervene in the signaling pathways and inhibit PVAC functions.

Mesenchymal stem cell-based HSP70 promoter-driven VEGFA induction by resveratrol promotes angiogenesis in a mouse model,

Abstract: Several studies of stem cell-based gene therapy have indicated that long-lasting regeneration following vessel ischemia may be stimulated through VEGFA gene therapy and/or MSC transplantation for reduction of ischemic injury in limb ischemia and heart failure. The therapeutic potential of MSC transplantation can be further improved by genetically modifying MSCs with genes which enhance angiogenesis following ischemic injury. In the present study, we aimed to develop an approach in MSC-based therapy for repair and mitigation of ischemic injury and regeneration of damaged tissues in ischemic disease. HSP70 promoter-driven VEGFA expression was induced by resveratrol (RSV) in MSCs, and in combination with known RSV biological functions, the protective effects of our approach were investigated by using ex vivo aortic ring coculture system and a 3D scaffolds in vivo model. Results of this investigation demonstrated that HSP promoter-driven VEGFA expression in MSC increased approximately 2-fold over the background VEGFA levels upon HSP70 promoter induction by RSV. Exposure of HUVEC cells to medium containing MSC in which VEGFA had been induced by cis-RSV enhanced tube formation in the treated HUVEC cells. RSV-treated MSC cells differentiated into endothelial-like phenotypes, exhibiting markedly elevated expression of endothelial cell markers. These MSCs also induced aortic ring sprouting, characteristic of neovascular formation from pre-existing vessels, and additionally promoted neovascularization at the MSC transplantation site in a mouse model. These observations support a hypothesis that VEGFA expression induced by cis-RSV acting on the HSP70 promoter in transplanted MSC augments the angiogenic effects of stem cell gene therapy. The use of an inducible system also vastly reduces possible clinical risks associated with constitutive VEGFA expression.

Abstract: Circadian clock is an evolutionarily conserved timing mechanism governing diverse biological processes and the skeletal muscle possesses intrinsic functional clocks. Interestingly, although the essential clock transcription activator, Brain and muscle Arnt-like 1 (Bmal1), participates in maintenance of muscle mass, little is known regarding its role in muscle growth and repair. In this report, we investigate the in vivo function of Bmal1 in skeletal muscle regeneration using two muscle injury models. Bmal1 is highly up-regulated by cardiotoxin injury, and its genetic ablation significantly impairs regeneration with markedly suppressed new myofiber formation and attenuated myogenic induction. A similarly defective regenerative response is observed in Bmal1-null mice as compared to wild-type controls upon freeze injury. Lack of satellite cell expansion accounts for the regeneration defect, as Bmal1−/− mice display significantly lower satellite cell number with nearly abolished induction of the satellite cell marker, Pax7. Furthermore, satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts devoid of Bmal1 display reduced growth and proliferation ex vivo. Collectively, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that Bmal1 is an integral component of the pro-myogenic response that is required for muscle repair. This mechanism may underlie its role in preserving adult muscle mass and could be targeted therapeutically to prevent muscle-wasting diseases.

Abstract: Adenovirus serotypes have been shown to cause drastic changes in nuclear organization, including the transcription machinery, during infection. This ability of adenovirus to subvert transcription in the host cell facilitates viral replication. Because nuclear actin and nuclear myosin I, myosin V and myosin VI have been implicated as direct regulators of transcription and important factors in the replication of other viruses, we sought to determine how nuclear actin and myosins are involved in adenovirus infection. We first confirmed reorganization of the host's transcription machinery to viral replication centers. We found that nuclear actin also reorganizes to sites of transcription through the intermediate but not the advanced late phase of viral infection. Furthermore, nuclear myosin I localized with nuclear actin and sites of transcription in viral replication centers. Intriguingly, nuclear myosins V and VI, which also reorganized to viral replication centers, exhibited different localization patterns, suggesting specialized roles for these nuclear myosins. Finally, we assessed the role of actin in adenovirus infection and found both cytoplasmic and nuclear actin likely play roles in adenovirus infection and replication. Together our data suggest the involvement of actin and multiple myosins in the nuclear replication and late viral gene expression of adenovirus.

Abstract: Epidermal keratinocytes serve as the primary barrier between the body and environmental stressors. They are subjected to numerous stress events and are likely to respond with a repertoire of heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPA6 (HSP70B′) is described in other cell types with characteristically low to undetectable basal expression, but is highly stress induced. Despite this response in other cells, little is known about its control in keratinocytes. We examined endogenous human keratinocyte HSPA6 expression and localized some responsible transcription factor sites in a cloned HSPA6 3 kb promoter. Using promoter 5′ truncations and deletions, negative and positive regulatory regions were found throughout the 3 kb promoter. A region between −346 and −217 bp was found to be crucial to HSPA6 basal expression and stress inducibility. Site-specific mutations and DNA-binding studies show that a previously uncharacterized AP1 site contributes to the basal expression and maximal stress induction of HSPA6. Additionally, a new heat shock element (HSE) within this region was defined. While this element mediates increased transcriptional response in thermally stressed HaCaT keratinocytes, it preferentially binds a stress-inducible factor other than heat shock factor (HSF)1 or HSF2. Intriguingly, this newly characterized HSPA6 HSE competes HSF1 binding a consensus HSE and binds both HSF1 and HSF2 from other epithelial cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the HSPA6 promoter contains essential negative and positive promoter regions and newly identified transcription factor targets, which are key to the basal and stress-inducible expression of HSPA6. Furthermore, these results suggest that an HSF-like factor may preferentially bind this newly identified HSPA6 HSE in HaCaT cells.

Abstract: The emergence of new methods for reprogramming of adult somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) led to the development of new approaches in drug discovery and regenerative medicine. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the self-renewal, expansion and differentiation of human iPSC (hiPSC) should lead to improvements in the manufacture of safe and reliable cell therapy products. The goal of our study was qualitative and quantitative proteomic characterizations of hiPSC by means of electrospray ionization (ESI)-MSe and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (MS). Proteomes of hiPSCs of different somatic origins: fibroblasts and peripheral blood CD34+ cells, reprogrammed by the same technique, were compared with the original somatic cells and hESC. Quantitative proteomic comparison revealed approximately 220 proteins commonly up-regulated in all three pluripotent stem cell lines compared to the primary cells. Expression of 21 proteins previously reported as pluripotency markers was up-regulated in both hiPSCs (8 were confirmed by Western blot). A number of novel candidate marker proteins with the highest fold-change difference between hiPSCs/hESC and somatic cells discovered by MS were confirmed by Western blot. A panel of 22 candidate marker proteins of hiPSC was developed and expression of these proteins was confirmed in 8 additional hiPSC lines.

Abstract: The tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) family of receptor tyrosine kinases controls synaptic function, plasticity and sustains differentiation, morphology, and neuronal cell survival. Understanding Trk receptors down-regulation and recycling is a crucial step to point out sympathetic and sensory neuron function and survival. PC12 cells derived from pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla have been widely used as a model system for studies of neuronal differentiation as they respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) with a dramatic change in phenotype and acquire a number of properties characteristic of sympathetic neurons. In this study we demonstrated that in PC12 cells the TrkA receptor interacts with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP8/UBPy in a NGF-dependent manner and that it is deubiquitinated in vivo and in vitro by USP8. USP8 overexpression blocked NGF-induced neurites outgrowth while the overexpression of the catalytically inactive mutant USP8/UBPyC748A caused a marked increase of cell differentiation. Localization and biochemical experiments have point out that USP8 and TrkA partially co-localize in endosomes after NGF stimulation. Finally we have studied the role played by USP8 on TrkA turnover; using specific siRNA for USP8 we found that USP8 knockdown increases TrkA half-life, suggesting that the deubiquitinating activity of USP8 promotes TrkA degradation.

Abstract: Motile cilia generate directional flows that move mucus through airways, cerebrospinal fluid through brain ventricles, and oocytes through fallopian tubes. In addition, specialized monocilia beat in a rotational pattern to create asymmetric flows that are involved in establishing the left–right (LR) body axis during embryogenesis. These monocilia, which we refer to as “left–right cilia,” produce a leftward flow of extraembryonic fluid in a transient “organ of asymmetry” that directs asymmetric signaling and development of LR asymmetries in the cardiovascular system and gastrointestinal tract. The asymmetric flows are thought to establish a chemical gradient and/or activate mechanosensitive cilia to initiate calcium ion signals and a conserved Nodal (TGFβ) pathway on the left side of the embryo, but the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. The zebrafish organ of asymmetry, called Kupffer's vesicle, provides a useful model system for investigating LR cilia and cilia-powered fluid flows. Here, we describe methods to visualize flows in Kupffer's vesicle using fluorescent microspheres and introduce a new and freely available MATLAB particle tracking code to quantitatively describe these flows. Analysis of normal and aberrant flows indicates this approach is useful for characterizing flow properties that impact LR asymmetry and may be more broadly applicable for quantifying other cilia flows.

Abstract: The genome-wide loss of histone H4 lysine 20 tri-methylation (H4K20me3) is observed in multiple types of cancer, including breast tumors. Since H4K20me3 is preferentially targeted to repetitive elements in the pericentromeric and telomeric heterochromatin and plays a role in chromatin integrity, the pathological effects of disrupted H4K20me3 in tumors have been attributed to genomic instability. However, in this report, we show that loss of H4K20me3 modulates gene expression profiles, leading to increased cell invasion. Reduced H4K20me3 levels in tumor cells are often accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the H4K20-specific methyltransferase, SUV420H2. Exogenous delivery of SUV420H2 into MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells induced selective and specific changes in the expression of cancer-related genes. One of the most downregulated genes in response to SUV420H2 expression was the Src substrate, tensin-3, a focal adhesion protein that contributes to cancer cell migration. Depletion of tensin-3 suppressed breast cancer cell invasiveness. Furthermore, silencing of tensin-3 was associated with enrichment of H4K20me3 immediately upstream of the tensin-3 transcription start site, suggesting that the loss of H4K20me3 in tumor cells induced the expression of cancer-promoting genes. These findings connect the loss of H4K20me3 with tumor progression, through the transcriptional activation of cancer-promoting genes.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most-common genetic determinants of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The G2019S mutation is detected most frequently and is associated with increased kinase activity. Whereas G2019S mutant dopamine neurons exhibit neurite elongation deficits, the effect of G2019S on other neuronal subtypes is unknown. As PD patients also suffer from non-motor symptoms that may be unrelated to dopamine neuron loss, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to assess morphological and functional properties of peripheral sensory neurons. LRRK2 G2019S iPSC-derived sensory neurons exhibited normal neurite length but had large microtubule-containing neurite aggregations. Additionally, LRRK2 G2019S iPSC-derived sensory neurons displayed altered calcium dynamics. Treatment with LRRK2 kinase inhibitors resulted in significant, but not complete, morphological and functional rescue. These data indicate a role for LRRK2 kinase activity in sensory neuron structure and function, which when disrupted, may lead to sensory neuron deficits in PD.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient differentiation of pluripotent cells to proximal and distal lung epithelial cell populations remains a challenging task. The 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold is a key component that regulates the interaction of secreted factors with cells during development by often binding to and limiting their diffusion within local gradients. Here we examined the role of the lung ECM in differentiation of pluripotent cells in vitro and demonstrate the robust inductive capacity of the native lung matrix alone. Extended culture of stem cell-derived definitive endoderm on decellularized lung scaffolds in defined, serum-free medium resulted in differentiation into mature airway epithelia, complete with ciliated cells, club cells, and basal cells with morphological and functional similarities to native airways. Heparitinase I, but not chondroitinase ABC, treatment of scaffolds revealed that the differentiation achieved is dependent on heparan sulfate proteoglycans and its bound factors remaining on decellularized scaffolds.

Abstract: Summary
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) are a tissue culture model in which small intestine-like tissue is generated from pluripotent stem cells. By carrying out unsupervised hierarchical clustering of RNA-sequencing data, we demonstrate that HIOs most closely resemble human fetal intestine. We observed that genes involved in digestive tract development are enriched in both fetal intestine and HIOs compared to adult tissue, whereas genes related to digestive function and Paneth cell host defense are expressed at higher levels in adult intestine. Our study also revealed that the intestinal stem cell marker OLFM4 is expressed at very low levels in fetal intestine and in HIOs, but is robust in adult crypts. We validated our findings using in vivo transplantation to show that HIOs become more adult-like after transplantation. Our study emphasizes important maturation events that occur in the intestine during human development and demonstrates that HIOs can be used to model fetal-to-adult maturation.

Bacterial Uracil Modulates Drosophila DUOX-Dependent Gut Immunity via Hedgehog-Induced Signaling Endosomes,

Abstract: Summary
Genetic studies in Drosophila have demonstrated that generation of microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the NADPH dual oxidase (DUOX) is a first line of defense in the gut epithelia. Bacterial uracil acts as DUOX-activating ligand through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway modulates uracil-induced DUOX activation. Uracil-induced Hh signaling is required for intestinal expression of the calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule Cadherin 99C (Cad99C) and subsequent Cad99C-dependent formation of endosomes. These endosomes play essential roles in uracil-induced ROS production by acting as signaling platforms for PLCβ/PKC/Ca2+-dependent DUOX activation. Animals with impaired Hh signaling exhibit abolished Cad99C-dependent endosome formation and reduced DUOX activity, resulting in high mortality during enteric infection. Importantly, endosome formation, DUOX activation, and normal host survival are restored by genetic reintroduction of Cad99C into enterocytes, demonstrating the important role for Hh signaling in host resistance to enteric infection.

Myofibrillogenesis regulator-1 attenuates hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced injury by repairing microfilaments in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes,

Abstract: Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury is characterized by microfilament reorganization in cardiomyocytes. Previous studies have shown that myofibrillogenesis regulator-1 (MR-1) is expressed in the myocardium and promotes actin organization in cardiomyocytes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of MR-1 in attenuating hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in cardiomyocytes through promoting restoration of the microfilament. To address this aim, an H/R model of cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes was used to assess filamentous actin (F-actin) and α-actinin organization through immunofluorescence microscopy analysis. RT-PCR was used to detect mRNA levels of MR-1 and myosin regulatory light chain-2 (MLC-2). Western blot analysis was used to detect protein levels of MR-1 and filamentous actin/globular actin (F-/G-actin) as well as MLC-2 and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylation and protein expression. We also explored the effects of overexpressing or knocking down MR-1 on H/R injury and the MLCK/MLC-2/F-actin pathway. We found that H/R induced cardiomyocyte injury and disruption of F-actin and α-actinin with a decrease in the F-/G-actin ratio compared with controls. Compared with the H/R group, MR-1 overexpression attenuated H/R-induced injury and disruption of F-actin and α-actinin in cardiomyocytes with an increase in the F-/G-actin ratio. MR-1 overexpression also up-regulated H/R-induced MLCK and MLC-2 phosphorylation. However, MR-1 knockdown aggravated H/R injury by further disrupting F-actin and α-actinin, as well as decreasing the F-/G-actin ratio. MR-1 knockdown also down-regulated MLCK and MLC-2 phosphorylation induced by H/R injury. These findings suggest that MR-1 attenuates H/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury by promoting microfilament reorganization through the activation of the MLCK/MLC-2 pathway.

Abstract: Background
Increased expression of the tetraspanin TSPAN7 has been observed in a number of cancers; however, it is unclear how TSPAN7 plays a role in cancer progression.
Methods
We investigated the expression of TSPAN7 in the haematological malignancy multiple myleoma (MM) and assessed the consequences of TSPAN7 expression in the adhesion, migration and growth of MM plasma cells (PC) in vitro and in bone marrow (BM) homing and tumour growth in vivo. Finally, we characterised the association of TSPAN7 with cell surface partner molecules in vitro.
Results
TSPAN7 was found to be highly expressed at the RNA and protein level in CD138+ MM PC from approximately 50% of MM patients. TSPAN7 overexpression in the murine myeloma cell line 5TGM1 significantly reduced tumour burden in 5TGM1/KaLwRij mice 4 weeks after intravenous adminstration of 5TGM1 cells. While TSPAN7 overexpression did not affect cell proliferation in vitro, TSPAN7 increased 5TGM1 cell adhesion to BM stromal cells and transendothelial migration. In addition, TSPAN7 was found to associate with the molecular chaperone calnexin on the cell surface.
Conclusion
These results suggest that elevated TSPAN7 may be associated with better outcomes for up to 50% of MM patients.

Abstract: Visualization and quantification of supramolecular assemblies in cells are essential to understand the design principles of cells and tissues. The advent of photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and related techniques has offered unprecedented information on protein supramolecular assemblies in 3-D with a spatial resolution of a few tens of nanometers. Yet application of PALM microscopy for in vivo studies remains challenging. This chapter describes how to implement PALM microscopy for quantitative analysis of intercellular adhesion in the Drosophila embryo. Our protocol describes the sample preparation, the imaging setup, and the acquisition procedure. We also discuss how to proceed with quantitative analysis of data. Initially designed and implemented for Drosophila embryo imaging of intercellular adhesion, this protocol can be readily adapted to other structures than adhesions and other organisms such as Zebrafish or Caenorhabditis elegans.

Abstract: The ability to reliably quantify the relative degree of storage burden that results from lysosomal dysfunction is an important goal. Such measurements not only allow an assessment of different stages of disease progression, but also the assessment of therapeutic strategies. Although biochemical methods exist for doing this, retaining the anatomical integrity of tissue samples is an important consideration. This chapter provides practical methodological recommendations for achieving this goal in tissue sections, either by directly visualizing or staining the storage material, and subsequently quantifying it via image analysis.

Abstract: Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) targeted therapy has been explored for glioblastoma treatment. However, it is unclear which RTK inhibitors are the most effective and there are no predictive biomarkers available. We recently identified the RTK AXL as a putative target for the pan-RTK inhibitors cediranib and sunitinib, which are under clinical trials for glioblastoma patients. Here, we provide evidence that AXL activity can modulate sunitinib response in glioblastoma cell lines. We found that AXL knockdown conferred lower sensitivity to sunitinib by rescuing migratory defects and inhibiting apoptosis in cells expressing high AXL basal levels. Accordingly, overactivation of AXL by its ligand GAS6 rendered AXL positive glioblastoma cells more sensitive to sunitinib. AXL knockdown induced a cellular rewiring of several growth signaling pathways through activation of RTKs, such as EGFR, as well as intracellular pathways such as MAPK and AKT. The combination of sunitinib with a specific AKT inhibitor reverted the resistance of AXL-silenced cells to sunitinib. Together, our results suggest that sunitinib inhibits AXL and AXL activation status modulates therapy response of glioblastoma cells to sunitinib. Moreover, it indicates that combining sunitinib therapy with AKT pathway inhibitors could overcome sunitinib resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Virulence factors expressed by enteric bacteria are pivotal for pathogen colonization and induction of intestinal disease, but the mechanisms by which host immunity regulates pathogen virulence are largely unknown. Here we show that specific antibody responses are required for downregulation of virulence gene expression in Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric pathogen that models human infections with attaching-and-effacing bacteria. In the absence of antibodies against the pathogen, phenotypically virulent C. rodentium, accumulated and infected the epithelium and subsequently invaded the lamina propia, causing host lethality. IgG induced after infection recognized virulence factors and bound virulent bacteria within the intestinal lumen, leading to their engulfment by neutrophils, while phenotypically avirulent pathogens remained in the intestinal lumen and were eventually outcompeted by the microbiota. Thus, the interplay of the innate and adaptive immune system selectively targets virulent C. rodentium in the intestinal lumen to promote pathogen eradication and host survival.

Abstract: Febrile temperatures can induce stress responses which protect cells from damage and can reduce inflammation during infections and sepsis. However, the mechanisms behind the protective functions of heat in response to the bacterial endotoxin LPS are unclear. We have recently shown that Annexin-1 (ANXA1)-deficient macrophages exhibited higher TNFα levels after LPS stimulation. Moreover, we have previously reported that ANXA1 can function as a stress protein. Therefore in this study, we determined if ANXA1 is involved in the protective effects of heat on cytokine levels in macrophages after heat and LPS. Exposure of macrophages to 42°C for 1 h prior to LPS results in an inhibition of TNFα production, which was not evident in ANXA1−/− macrophages. We show that this regulation involves primarily MYD88-independent pathways. ANXA1 regulates TNFα mRNA stability after heat and LPS, and this is dependent on endogenous ANXA1 expression and not exogenously secreted factors. Further mechanistic studies revealed the possible involvement of the heat shock protein HSP70 and JNK in the heat and inflammatory stress response regulated by ANXA1. This study shows that ANXA1, an immunomodulatory protein, is critical in the heat stress response induced after heat and endotoxin stimulation.

Abstract: Epithelial injury and tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) within a hypoxic microenvironment are associated with progressive loss of renal function in chronic kidney disease [CKD]. Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) is an important mediator of renal fibrosis. Growing evidence suggests that Vitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] and its analogues may have a renoprotective effect in CKD. Here we examined the protective effect of the vitamin D analogue paricalcitol [PC; 19-nor-1α,3β,25-trihydroxy-9,10-secoergosta-5(Z),7(E) 22(E)-triene] on the responses of human renal epithelial cells to TGF-β1. PC attenuated TGF-β1-induced Smad 2 phosphorylation and upregulation of the Notch ligand Jagged-1, α-smooth muscle actin and thrombospondin-1 and prevented the TGF-β1-mediated loss of E-Cadherin. To mimic the hypoxic milieu of CKD we cultured renal epithelial cells in hypoxia [1% O2] and observed similar attenuation by PC of TGF-β1-induced fibrotic responses. Furthermore, in cells cultured in normoxia [21% O2], PC induced an accumulation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) 1α and HIF-2α in a time and concentration [1µM–2µM] dependent manner. Here, PC-induced HIF stabilisation was dependent on activation of the PI-3Kinase pathway. This is the first study to demonstrate regulation of the HIF pathway by PC which may have importance in the mechanism underlying renoprotection by PC.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is implicated in pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and death resulting in type 2 diabetes. Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is an essential component of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and consists of two isoforms, ATF6α and ATF6β. Here we investigated the role of ATF6β. ATF6β mRNA was detected in pancreatic β-cell lines and rodent and human islets. We also detected ATF6β protein and production of the active form (ATF6βp60) in response to ER stress. Knock-down of ATF6β in INS-1 832/13 insulinoma cells did not affect mRNA induction of several major UPR genes in response to ER stress, suggesting ATF6β is not essential for the basic UPR. Expressing active ATF6βp60 or ATF6αp50 followed by microarray analysis showed that they regulate similar UPR genes, although some genes such as Wfs1 are ATF6β-specific. ATF6β, but not ATF6α, is able to bind the Wfs1 promoter and induce Wfs1 gene and protein expression. Knock-down of ATF6β increased the susceptibility of β-cells to ER stress-induced apoptosis, while overexpression of active ATF6βp60 reduced apoptosis. Thus, ATF6β is not essential for induction of most UPR genes, but is required to maintain cell survival in β-cells undergoing chronic ER stress, which in part relates to its ability to induce Wfs1, a pro-survival gene.

Abstract: In order to obtain fine details in 3 dimensions (3D) over time, it is critical for motile biological specimens to be appropriately immobilized. Of the many immobilization options available, the mechanical microcompressor offers many benefits. Our device, previously described, achieves gentle flattening of a cell, allowing us to image finely detailed structures of numerous organelles and physiological processes in living cells. We have imaged protozoa and other small metazoans using differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, orientation-independent (OI) DIC, and real-time birefringence imaging using a video-enhanced polychromatic polscope. We also describe an enhancement of our previous design by engineering a new device where the coverslip mount is fashioned onto the top of the base; so the entire apparatus is accessible on top of the stage. The new location allows for easier manipulation of the mount when compressing or releasing a specimen on an inverted microscope. Using this improved design, we imaged immobilized bacteria, yeast, paramecia, and nematode worms and obtained an unprecedented view of cell and specimen details. A variety of microscopic techniques were used to obtain high resolution images of static and dynamic cellular and physiological events.

Abstract: Incorporation of radioactive precursors of amino acids and/or modifier groups into proteins, isolation and sizing of polypeptide species of interest, and finally their detection and characterization provide a robust handle to examine the life cycle and varied modifications of any protein. A prerequisite in application of these techniques to lysosomal enzymes is the availability of an avid and specific antibody, because lysosomal proteins represent a very minor fraction of the cellular protein and must be purified without a significant loss many 1000-fold as conveniently as possible. Pulse–chase labeling and good knowledge on organelle-specific modifications of lysosomal proteins may enhance the information that can be obtained from such experiments. We describe procedures for pulse–chase labeling experiments that have proven to work with a commercially available antibody against a mouse and a human lysosomal protease and can be used as a reference in establishing the technique in any laboratory that has an access to a certified isotope facility and the knowledge to handle radioactivity safely. We discuss the crucial steps and refer to alternatives described in the literature. The present model protein cathepsin Z is synthesized as a larger proenzyme that contains two N-linked oligosaccharides and matures to a shorter single chain enzyme retaining the processed oligosaccharides. A pulse–chase experiment demonstrates the conversion of the precursor into the mature form. In addition, results on deglycosylation of metabolically labeled cathepsin Z are shown and the alterations in the apparent size of the glycopeptides are explained.

Both proteins are important for energy metabolism, and previous studies on AK focused on this attribute. In this study, the arginine kinase gene was isolated from Apis cerana cerana and was named AccAK. A 5'-flanking region was also cloned and shown to contain abundant putative binding sites for transcription factors related to development and response to adverse stress. We imitated several abiotic and biotic stresses suffered by A. cerana cerana during their life, including heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, heat, cold, oxidants, antioxidants, ecdysone, and Ascosphaera apis and then studied the expression patterns of AccAK after these treatments. AccAK was upregulated under all conditions, and, in some conditions, this response was very pronounced. Western blot and AccAK enzyme activity assays confirmed the results. In addition, a disc diffusion assay showed that overexpression of AccAK reduced the resistance of Escherichia coli cells to multiple adverse stresses. Taken together, our results indicated that AccAK may be involved of great significance in response to adverse abiotic and biotic stresses.

Abstract: The possibility of converting cells from blood mononuclear cells (MNC) to liver cells provides promising opportunities for the study of diseases and the assessment of new drugs. However, clinical applications have to meet GMP requirements and the methods for generating induced pluripotent cells (iPCs) have to avoid insertional mutagenesis, a possibility when using viral vehicles for the delivery of reprogramming factors. We have developed an efficient non-integration method for reprogramming fresh or frozen blood MNC, maintained in an optimised cytokine cocktail, to generate induced pluripotent cells. Using electroporation for the effective delivery of episomal transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, L-Myc, and Lin28) in a feeder-free system, without any requirement for small molecules, we achieved a reprogramming efficiency of up to 0.033% (65 colonies from 2×105 seeded MNC). Applying the same cytokine cocktail and reprogramming methods to cord blood or fetal liver-derived CD34+ cells, we obtained 148 iPS colonies from 105 seeding cells (0.148%). The iPS cell lines we generated maintained typical characteristics of pluripotent cells and could be successfully differentiated into hepatocytes with drug metabolic function.

Abstract: Our previous study demonstrated that low-dose endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide-II (EMAP-II) induces blood–tumor barrier (BTB) opening via the RhoA/Rho kinase/protein kinase C (PKC)-α/β signaling pathway and that PKC-ζ is involved in this process via other mechanisms. In the present study, using an in vitro BTB model, we detected the exact signaling mechanisms by which PKC-ζ activation affects EMAP-II-induced BTB hyperpermeability. Our results showed that three types of serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein phosphatases (PPs), namely PP1, PP2A, and PP2B, were expressed by rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMECs). There was an interaction between PKC-ζ and PP2A in RBMECs. In addition, EMAP-II induced a significant increase in both the expression and the activity of PP2A in RBMECs. Inhibition of PKC-ζ with PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate inhibitor (PKC-ζ-PI) completely blocked EMAP-II-induced PP2A activation. Conversely, inhibition of PP2A with okadaic acid (OA) had no effect on EMAP-II-induced PKC-ζ activation. Like PKC-ζ-PI, OA partially prevented EMAP-II-induced BTB hyperpermeability and occludin redistribution in RBMECs. Neither PKC-ζ-PI nor OA affected EMAP-II-induced phosphorylation of myosin light chain and redistribution of actin cytoskeleton in RBMECs. Taken together, our present study demonstrated that low-dose EMAP-II increases BTB permeability by activating the PKC-ζ/PP2A signaling pathway, which consequently leads to the disruption of TJs and impairment of endothelial barrier function.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been extensively utilized for various cell therapeutic trials, but the signals regulating their stromal function remain largely unclear. Here, we show that canonical Wnt signals distinctively regulate MSCs in a biphasic manner depending on signal intensity, i.e., MSCs exhibit proliferation and progenitor self-renewal under low Wnt/β-catenin signaling, whereas they exhibit enhanced osteogenic differentiation with priming to osteoblast-like lineages under high Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, low or high levels of β-catenin in MSCs distinctly regulated the hematopoietic support of MSCs to promote proliferation or the undifferentiated state of hematopoietic progenitors, respectively. A gene expression study demonstrated that different intracellular levels of β-catenin in MSCs induce distinct transcriptomic changes in subsets of genes belonging to different gene function categories. Different β-catenin levels also induced differences in intracellular levels of the β-catenin co-factors, Tcf-1 and Lef-1. Moreover, nano-scale mass spectrometry of proteins that co-precipitated with β-catenin revealed distinctive spectra of proteins selectively interacting with β-catenin at specific expression levels. Together, these results show that Wnt/β-catenin signals can coax distinct transcription milieu to induce different transcription profiles in MSCs depending on the signal intensity and that fine-tuning of the canonical Wnt signaling intensity can regulate the phase-specific functionality of MSCs.

Abstract: Cancer cells present a particular metabolic behavior. We hypothesized that the progression of bladder cancer could be accompanied by changes in cells glycolytic profile. We studied two human bladder cancer cells, RT4 and TCCSUP, in which the latter represents a more invasive stage. The levels of glucose, pyruvate, alanine and lactate in the extracellular media were measured by Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The protein expression levels of glucose transporters 1 (GLUT1) and 3 (GLUT3), monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined. Our data showed that glucose consumption and GLUT3 levels were similar in both cell lines, but TCCSUP cells displayed lower levels of GLUT1 and PFK expression. An increase in pyruvate consumption, concordant with the higher levels of lactate and alanine production, was also detected in TCCSUP cells. Moreover, TCCSUP cells presented lower protein expression levels of GPT and LDH. These results illustrate that bladder cancer progression is associated with alterations in cells glycolytic profile, namely the switch from glucose to pyruvate consumption in the more aggressive stage. This may be useful to develop new therapies and to identify biomarkers for cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferon (IFN-α/β or IFN-I) signals through two receptor subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, to orchestrate sterile and infectious immunity. Cellular pathways that regulate IFNAR1 are often targeted by viruses to suppress the antiviral effects of IFN-I. Here we report that encephalitic flaviviruses, including tick-borne encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, antagonize IFN-I signaling by inhibiting IFNAR1 surface expression. Loss of IFNAR1 was associated with binding of the viral IFN-I antagonist, NS5, to prolidase (PEPD), a cellular dipeptidase implicated in primary immune deficiencies in humans. Prolidase was required for IFNAR1 maturation and accumulation, activation of IFNβ-stimulated gene induction, and IFN-I-dependent viral control. Human fibroblasts derived from patients with genetic prolidase deficiency exhibited decreased IFNAR1 surface expression and reduced IFNβ-stimulated signaling. Thus, by understanding flavivirus IFN-I antagonism, prolidase is revealed as a central regulator of IFN-I responses.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) treatments presently rely on analgesics, which manage pain but fail to restore imbalances between catabolic and anabolic processes that underlie OA pathogenesis. Recently, biologic (biotherapeutic) drugs, which alter the activity of catabolic agents such as nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines in ways, allowing tissue regeneration, were evaluated for efficacy in OA treatment. These studies failed to demonstrate dramatic abatement of OA symptoms by these drugs, but suggested strategies by which biologic agents might be used to treat OA. The present review summarizes current understanding of OA pathogenesis and evolving treatments. Preliminary evaluations of a novel biotherapeutic strategy are presented here. Twenty OA patients receiving sour topical cherry seed extract (SCE), an inducer of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a major physiological protectant against oxidative stress exhibited significantly decreased joint pain and activation of CD4+ T cells expressing inflammatory cytokines (p < 0.05), significantly decreased peripheral blood C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased leukocyte HO-1 (p < 0.05) in comparison with ten placebo-treated patients. SCE inhibits joint-damaging inflammatory mediator production. This agent therefore meets the main criterion for classification as a “biotherapeutic,” or “biologic” agent. The negligible toxicity and low cost of such materials make them promising contributors to OA treatment, sustainable within resource limitations of a wide range of patients.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are required for spermatogenesis. Earlier studies showed that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was indispensable for SSC self-renewal by binding to the GFRA1/RET receptor. Mice with mutations in these molecules showed impaired spermatogenesis, which was attributed to SSC depletion. Here we show that SSCs undergo GDNF-independent self-renewal. A small number of spermatogonia formed colonies when testis fragments from a Ret mutant mouse strain were transplanted into heterologous recipients. Moreover, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) supplementation enabled in vitro SSC expansion without GDNF. Although GDNF-mediated self-renewal signaling required both AKT and MAP2K1/2, the latter was dispensable in FGF2-mediated self-renewal. FGF2-depleted testes exhibited increased levels of GDNF and were enriched for SSCs, suggesting that the balance between FGF2 and GDNF levels influences SSC self-renewal in vivo. Our results show that SSCs exhibit at least two modes of self-renewal and suggest complexity of SSC regulation in vivo.

Abstract: Microglia play an important role in neuronal protection and damage. However, the molecular and cellular relationship between microglia and neurons is unclear. We carried out a prospective study to detect that activation of BV2 microglia induced PC12 cell apoptosis in vitro through the TLR4/adapter protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. BV2 microglia were treated with different concentrations of LPS for 24 h. Western blot was utilized to detect the expression of TLR4 and the downstream signaling pathway. The level of inflammatory mediator was quantified using a specific ELISA kit. The supernatant of 10 μg/ml LPS-treated BV2 cells was used as conditioned medium (CM). PC12 cells were co-culture with CM for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay and cell apoptosis was tested by flow cytometry. BV2 microglia were treated with 10, 20, or 30 μg/ml LPS for 24 h. The expression of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB significantly increased. When PC12 cells were co-cultured with CM for 24 h, cell viability decreased. CM up-regulated the Bax level and down-regulated the Bcl-2 protein level in PC12 cells. PC12 cells pretreated with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) for 30 min, significantly alleviated CM-induced PC12 cell apoptosis. These results suggest that BV2 microglia activated by LPS triggered TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway that induced the release of IL-1β and could participate in the PC12 cells injury.

Abstract: The transcriptional corepressor CtBP2 is essential for proper development of the nervous system. The factor exerts its repression by interacting in complexes with chromatin-modifying factors such as histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1/2 and the histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1. Notably, the histone acetyl transferase p300 acetylates CtBP2 and this is an important regulatory event of the activity and subcellular localization of the protein. We recently demonstrated an essential role for CtBPs as sensors of microenvironmental oxygen levels influencing the differentiation potential of neural stem cells (NSCs), but it is not known whether oxygen levels influence the acetylation levels of CtBP factors. Here we show by using proximity ligation assay (PLA) that CtBP2 acetylation levels increased significantly in undifferentiated, proliferating NSCs under hypoxic conditions. CtBP2 interacted with the class III HDAC Sirt1 but this interaction was unaltered in hypoxic conditions, and treatment with the Sirt1 inhibitor Ex527 did not result in any significant change in total CtBP2 acetylation levels. Instead, we revealed a significant decrease in PLA signal representing CtBP2 dimerization in NSCs under hypoxic conditions, negatively correlating with the acetylation levels. Our results suggest that microenvironmental oxygen levels influence the dimerization and acetylation levels, and thereby the activity, of CtBP2 in proliferating NSCs.

Abstract: Knowledge of the effects of glucotoxic and lipotoxic environments on proglucagon producing intestinal L cells and pancreatic alpha cells is limited compared with pancreatic beta cells. This study compares the in vitro responses of these cell types to hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Glucose (30mM) and palmitate (0.5mM) reduced GLUTag and MIN6 cell viability while alpha TC1 cells were sensitive only to lipotoxicity. Consistent with this, Cat mRNA expression was substantially higher in GLUTag and alpha TC1 cells compared to MIN6 cells. Glucose and palmitate reduced GLUTag cell secretory function while hypersecretion of glucagon was apparent from alpha TC1 cells. Glucose exposure increased transcription of Cat and Sod2 in MIN6 and GLUTag cells respectively while it decreased transcription of Cat and Gpx1 in alpha TC1 cells. Palmitate increased transcription of Cat and Sod2 in all three cell lines. Upregulation of antioxidant enzyme expression by palmitate was accompanied by an increase in Nfkb1 transcription, indicative of activation of defence pathways. Lipotoxicity activated ER stress response, evident from increased Hspa4 mRNA level in GLUTag and MIN6 cells. Glucose and palmitate-induced DNA damage and apoptosis, with substantially smaller effects in alpha TC1 cells. Thus alpha cells are resistant to gluco- and lipotoxicity, partly reflecting higher expression of genes involved in antioxidant defence. In contrast, intestinal L cells, like beta cells, are prone to gluco- and lipotoxicity, possibly contributing to abnormalities of GLP-1 secretion in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a pro-proliferative transcription factor that is expressed in dividing epithelial cells of the intestinal crypt. Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) has been identified as a stem cell marker in both small intestinal and colonic epithelial cells. To determine whether KLF5 regulates proliferation of intestinal stem cells, we investigated the effects of Klf5 deletion specifically from the intestinal stem cells in adult mice. Mice with inducible intestinal stem cell-specific deletion of Klf5 (Lgr5-Klf5fl/fl) were injected with tamoxifen for 5 consecutive days to induce Lgr5-driven Cre expression. Intestinal and colonic tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry at various time points up to 112days following start of tamoxifen treatment. Klf5 is co-localized in the crypt-based columnar (CBC) cells that express Lgr5. By 11days following the start of tamoxifen treatment, Lgr5-positive crypts from which Klf5 was deleted exhibited a loss of proliferation that was accompanied by an increase in apoptosis. Beginning at 14days following the start of tamoxifen treatment, both Klf5 expression and proliferation were re-established in the transit-amplifying epithelial cells but not in the Lgr5-positive CBC cells. By 112days post-treatment, up to 90% of the Lgr5-positive cells from which Klf5 was deleted were lost from the intestinal crypts. These results indicate a critical role for KLF5 in the survival and maintenance of intestinal stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Antigenic diversity has posed a critical barrier to vaccine development against the pathogenic blood-stage infection of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. To date, only strain-specific protection has been reported by trials of such vaccines in nonhuman primates. We recently showed that P. falciparum reticulocyte binding protein homolog 5 (PfRH5), a merozoite adhesin required for erythrocyte invasion, is highly susceptible to vaccine-inducible strain-transcending parasite-neutralizing antibody. In vivo efficacy of PfRH5-based vaccines has not previously been evaluated. Here, we demonstrate that PfRH5-based vaccines can protect Aotus monkeys against a virulent vaccine-heterologous P. falciparum challenge and show that such protection can be achieved by a human-compatible vaccine formulation. Protection was associated with anti-PfRH5 antibody concentration and in vitro parasite-neutralizing activity, supporting the use of this in vitro assay to predict the in vivo efficacy of future vaccine candidates. These data suggest that PfRH5-based vaccines have potential to achieve strain-transcending efficacy in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal progenitor cells have great therapeutic potential, yet incomplete characterization of their cell-surface interface limits their clinical exploitation. We have employed subcellular fractionation with quantitative discovery proteomics to define the cell-surface interface proteome of human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) and human umbilical cord perivascular cells (HUCPVCs). We compared cell-surface-enriched fractions from MSCs and HUCPVCs (three donors each) with adult mesenchymal fibroblasts using eight-channel isobaric-tagging mass spectrometry, yielding relative quantification on >6,000 proteins with high confidence. This approach identified 186 upregulated mesenchymal progenitor biomarkers. Validation of 10 of these markers, including ROR2, EPHA2, and PLXNA2, confirmed upregulated expression in mesenchymal progenitor populations and distinct roles in progenitor cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Our approach has delivered a cell-surface proteome repository that now enables improved selection and characterization of human mesenchymal progenitor populations.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the use of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in clinical therapy for over half a century, the mechanisms that regulate HSC trafficking, engraftment, and life-long persistence after transplantation are unclear. Here, we show that the vascular endothelium regulates HSC trafficking into and out of bone marrow (BM) niches. Surprisingly, we found that instead of acting as barriers to cellular entry, vascular endothelial cells, via the guidance molecule ROBO4, actively promote HSC translocation across vessel walls into the BM space. In contrast, we found that the vasculature inhibits the reverse process, as induced vascular permeability led to a rapid increase in HSCs in the blood stream. Thus, the vascular endothelium reinforces HSC localization to BM niches both by promoting HSC extravasation from blood-to-BM and by forming vascular barriers that prevent BM-to-blood escape. Our results uncouple the mechanisms that regulate the directionality of HSC trafficking and show that the vasculature can be targeted to improve hematopoietic transplantation therapies.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle stem cells named muscle satellite cells are normally quiescent but are activated in response to various stimuli, such as injury and overload. Activated satellite cells enter the cell cycle and proliferate to produce a large number of myogenic progenitor cells, and these cells then differentiate and fuse to form myofibers. Zinc is one of the essential elements in the human body, and has multiple roles, including cell growth and DNA synthesis. However, the role of zinc in myogenic cells is not well understood, and is the focus of this study. We first examined the effects of zinc on differentiation of murine C2C12 myoblasts and found that zinc promoted proliferation, with an increased number of cells incorporating EdU, but inhibited differentiation with reduced myogenin expression and myotube formation. Furthermore, we used the C2C12 reserve cell model of myogenic quiescence to investigate the role of zinc on activation of myogenic cells. The number of reserve cells incorporating BrdU was increased by zinc in a dose dependent manner, with the number dramatically further increased using a combination of zinc and insulin. Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are downstream of insulin signaling, and both were phosphorylated after zinc treatment. The zinc/insulin combination-induced activation involved the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and ERK cascade. We conclude that zinc promotes activation and proliferation of myogenic cells, and this activation requires phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and ERK as part of the signaling cascade.

To gain insight into the cellular and molecular cues that promote neurovascular co-patterning at the earliest stages of human embryogenesis, we developed a human embryonic stem cell model to mimic the developing epiblast. Contact of ectoderm-derived neural cells with mesoderm-derived vasculature is initiated via the neural crest (NC), not the neural tube (NT). Neurovascular co-patterning then ensues with specification of NC toward an autonomic fate requiring vascular endothelial cell (EC)-secreted nitric oxide (NO) and direct contact with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) via T-cadherin-mediated homotypic interactions. Once a neurovascular template has been established, NT-derived central neurons then align themselves with the vasculature. Our findings reveal that, in early human development, the autonomic nervous system forms in response to distinct molecular cues from VSMCs and ECs, providing a model for how other developing lineages might coordinate their co-patterning.

Abstract: Summary
During cell entry, non-enveloped viruses undergo partial uncoating to expose membrane lytic proteins for gaining access to the cytoplasm. We report that adenovirus uses membrane piercing to induce and hijack cellular wound removal processes that facilitate further membrane disruption and infection. Incoming adenovirus stimulates calcium influx and lysosomal exocytosis, a membrane repair mechanism resulting in release of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) and degradation of sphingomyelin to ceramide lipids in the plasma membrane. Lysosomal exocytosis is triggered by small plasma membrane lesions induced by the viral membrane lytic protein-VI, which is exposed upon mechanical cues from virus receptors, followed by virus endocytosis into leaky endosomes. Chemical inhibition or RNA interference of ASMase slows virus endocytosis, inhibits virus escape to the cytosol, and reduces infection. Ceramide enhances binding of protein-VI to lipid membranes and protein-VI-induced membrane rupture. Thus, adenovirus uses a positive feedback loop between virus uncoating and lipid signaling for efficient membrane penetration.

Abstract: Summary
miR-302/367 is the most abundant miRNA cluster in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and can promote somatic cell reprogramming. However, its role in hESCs remains poorly understood. Here, we studied functional roles of the endogenous miR-302/367 cluster in hESCs by employing specific TALE-based transcriptional repressors. We revealed that miR-302/367 cluster dually regulates hESC cell cycle and apoptosis in dose-dependent manner. Gene profiling and functional studies identified key targets of the miR-302/367 cluster in regulating hESC self-renewal and apoptosis. We demonstrate that in addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, miR-302/367 cluster conquers apoptosis by downregulating BNIP3L/Nix (a BH3-only proapoptotic factor) and upregulating BCL-xL expression. Furthermore, we show that butyrate, a natural compound, upregulates miR-302/367 cluster expression and alleviates hESCs from apoptosis induced by knockdown of miR-302/367 cluster. In summary, our findings provide new insights in molecular mechanisms of how miR-302/367 cluster regulates hESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Salmonella invasion of intestinal epithelial cells requires extensive, though transient, actin modifications at the site of bacterial entry. The actin-modifying protein villin is present in the brush border where it participates in the constitution of microvilli and in epithelial restitution after damage through its actin-severing activity. We investigated a possible role for villin in Salmonella invasion. The absence of villin, which is normally located at the bacterial entry site, leads to a decrease in Salmonella invasion. Villin is necessary for early membrane-associated processes and for optimal ruffle assembly by balancing the steady-state level of actin. The severing activity of villin is important for Salmonella invasion in vivo. The bacterial phosphatase SptP tightly regulates villin phosphorylation, while the actin-binding effector SipA protects F-actin and counterbalances villin-severing activity. Thus, villin plays an important role in establishing the balance between actin polymerization and actin severing to facilitate the initial steps of Salmonella entry.

Abstract: A loss of salivary gland function often occurs after radiation therapy in head and neck tumors, though secretion of saliva by the salivary glands is essential for the health and maintenance of the oral environment. Transplantation of salivary acinar cells (ACs), in part, may overcome the side effects of therapy. Here we directly differentiated mouse adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) into ACs using a co-culture system. Multipotent ADSCs can be easily collected from stromal vascular fractions of adipose tissues. The isolated ADSCs showed positive expression of markers such as integrin beta-1 (CD29), cell surface glycoprotein (CD44), endoglin (CD105), and Nanog. The cells were able to differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and neural-like cells after 14days in culture. ADSCs at passage 2 were co-cultured with mouse ACs in AC culture medium using the double-chamber (co-culture system) to avoid mixing the cell types. The ADSCs in this co-culture system expressed markers of ACs, such as α-amylases and aquaporin5, in both mRNA and protein. ADSCs cultured in AC-conditioned medium also expressed AC markers. Cellular proliferation and senescence analyses demonstrated that cells in the co-culture group showed lower senescence and a higher proliferation rate than the AC-conditioned medium group at Days 14 and 21. The results above imply direct conversion of ADSCs into ACs under the co-culture system; therefore, ADSCs may be a stem cell source for the therapy for salivary gland damage.

Abstract: Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is characterized by an arterial oxygenation defect induced by intrapulmonary vasodilation (IPVD) that increases morbidity and mortality. In our previous study, it was determined that both the proliferation and the myogenic differentiation of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) play a key role in the development of IPVD. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the relationship between IPVD and the myogenic differentiation of PMVECs remains unknown. Additionally, it has been shown that bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP2), via the control of protein expression, may regulate cell differentiation including cardiomyocyte differentiation, neuronal differentiation and odontoblastic differentiation. In this study, we observed that common bile duct ligation (CBDL)-rat serum induced the upregulation of the expression of several myogenic proteins (SM-α-actin, calponin, SM-MHC) and enhanced the expression levels of BMP2 mRNA and protein in PMVECs. We also observed that both the expression levels of Smad1/5 and the activation of phosphorylated Smad1/5 were significantly elevated in PMVECs following exposure to CBDL-rat serum, which was accompanied by the down-regulation of Smurf1. The blockage of the BMP2/Smad signaling pathway with Noggin inhibited the myogenic differentiation of PMVECs, a process that was associated with relatively low expression levels of both SM-α-actin and calponin in the setting of CBDL-rat serum exposure, although SM-MHC expression was not affected. These findings suggested that the BMP2/Smad signaling pathway is involved in the myogenic differentiation of the PMVECs. In conclusion, our data highlight the pivotal role of BMP2 in the CBDL-rat serum-induced myogenic differentiation of PMVECs via the activation of both Smad1 and Smad5 and the down-regulation of Smurf1, which may represent a potential therapy for HPS-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling.

Abstract: Changes in availability and utilisation of O2 and metabolic substrates are common in ischemia and cancer. We examined effects of substrate deprivation on HIF signalling in PC12 cells exposed to different atmospheric O2. Upon 2–4h moderate hypoxia, HIF-α protein levels were dictated by the availability of glutamine and glucose, essential for deep cell deoxygenation and glycolytic ATP flux. Nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α dramatically decreased upon inhibition of glutaminolysis or glutamine deprivation. Elevation of HIF-2α levels was transcription-independent and associated with the activation of Akt and Erk1/2. Upon 2h anoxia, HIF-2α levels strongly correlated with cellular ATP, produced exclusively via glycolysis. Without glucose, HIF signalling was suppressed, giving way to other regulators of cell adaptation to energy crisis, e.g. AMPK. Consequently, viability of cells deprived of O2 and glucose decreased upon inhibition of AMPK with dorsomorphin. The capacity of cells to accumulate HIF-2α decreased after 24h glucose deprivation. This effect, associated with increased AMPKα phosphorylation, was sensitive to dorsomorphin. In chronically hypoxic cells, glutamine played no major role in HIF-2α accumulation, which became mainly glucose-dependent. Overall, the availability of O2 and metabolic substrates intricately regulates HIF signalling by affecting cell oxygenation, ATP levels and pathways involved in production of HIF-α.

Abstract: The impact of the RNA-binding protein HuR for the post-transcriptional deregulation of tumor-relevant genes is well established. Despite of elevations in HuR expression levels, an increase in cytoplasmic HuR abundance in many cases correlates with a high grade of malignancy. Here, we demonstrated that administration of the actin-depolymerizing macrolide latrunculin A, or blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin II ATPase activity, caused a dose- and time-dependent reduction in the high cytoplasmic HuR content of HepG2 and Huh7 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Subcellular fractionation revealed that in addition, both inhibitors strongly attenuated cytoskeletal and membrane-bound HuR abundance and conversely increased the HuR amount in nuclear cell fractions. Concomitant with changes in intracellular HuR localization, both cytoskeletal inhibitors markedly decreased the half-lives of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), cyclin A and cyclin D1 encoding mRNAs resulting in a significant reduction in their expression levels in HepG2 cells. Importantly, a similar reduction in the expression of these HuR targets was achieved by a RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of either HuR or nonmuscle myoin IIA. Using polysomal fractionation, we further demonstrate that the decrease in cytoplasmic HuR by latrunculin A or blebbistatin is accompanied by a marked change in the allocation of HuR and its mRNA cargo from polysomes to ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles. Functionally, the basal migration and prostaglandin E2 synthesis are similarly impaired in inhibitor-treated and stable HuR-knockdown HepG2 cells. Our data demonstrate that interfering with the actomyosin-dependent HuR trafficking may comprise a valid therapeutic option for antagonizing pathologic posttranscriptional gene expression by HuR and furthermore emphasize the potential benefit of HuR inhibitory strategies for treatment of HCC.

Abstract: Centrosomes are small cytoplasmic organelles that function as major microtubule-organizing centres during interphase and mitosis. In cancer cells, centrosomes are frequently abnormal in number, size, and structure. Numerous studies have reported centrosome aberrations in human tumors where they frequently increase with malignant progression and advanced disease stage. However, there are a number of caveats when analyzing centrosomes in human tissue. Besides the actual immunodetection and quantification of centrosomes, which can be difficult and cumbersome, centrosome aberrations require a careful evaluation in the cellular context in which they occur. This chapter highlights the importance of careful interpretation of centrosome aberrations in human tumors.

Abstract: Wound healing is a complex process that involves the well-coordinated interactions of different cell types. Topical application of high doses of curcumin, a plant-derived polyphenol, enhances both normal and diabetic cutaneous wound healing in rodents. For optimal tissue repair interactions between epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts are essential. We previously demonstrated that curcumin increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and apoptosis in dermal fibroblasts, which could be prevented by pre-induction of the cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase (HO)-1. To better understand the effects of curcumin on wound repair, we now assessed the effects of high doses of curcumin on the survival of HaCaT keratinocytes and the role of the HO system. We exposed HaCaT keratinocytes to curcumin in the presence or absence of the HO-1 inducers heme (FePP) and cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP). We then assessed cell survival, ROS formation, and caspase activation. Curcumin induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in HaCaT keratinocytes via a ROS-dependent mechanism. Both FePP and CoPP induced HO-1 expression, but only FePP protected against curcumin-induced ROS formation and caspase-mediated apoptosis. In the presence of curcumin, FePP but not CoPP induced the expression of the iron scavenger ferritin. Together, our data show that the induction of ferritin, but not HO, protects HaCaT keratinocytes against cytotoxic doses of curcumin. The differential response of fibroblasts and keratinocytes to high curcumin doses may provide the basis for improving curcumin-based wound healing therapies.

Abstract: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that is characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness and wasting, with a failure of muscle maintenance/repair mediated by satellite cells (muscle stem cells). The function of skeletal muscle stem cells resident in dystrophic muscle may be perturbed by being in an increasing pathogenic environment, coupled with constant demands for repairing muscle. To investigate the contribution of satellite cell exhaustion to this process, we tested the functionality of satellite cells isolated from the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We found that satellite cells derived from young mdx mice contributed efficiently to muscle regeneration within our in vivo mouse model. To then test the effects of long-term residence in a dystrophic environment, satellite cells were isolated from aged mdx muscle. Surprisingly, they were as functional as those derived from young or aged wild type donors. Removing satellite cells from a dystrophic milieu reveals that their regenerative capacity remains both intact and similar to satellite cells derived from healthy muscle, indicating that the host environment is critical for controlling satellite cell function.

Abstract: Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is one of the most important transcriptional molecules in the heat shock process; however, HSF1 can also regulate the expression of other proteins. Dystrophin Dp71 is one of the most widely expressed isoforms of the dystrophin gene family. In our experiments, we showed for the first time that HSF1 can function as a transcriptional factor for endogenous Dp71 expression in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrated that the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of Dp71 were significantly reduced in HSF1-knockout mice compared with wild-type mice in brain, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney. Overexpression of HSF1 significantly enhanced the mRNA and protein expression of Dp71 in HeLa cells. Inhibiting the expression of HSF1 in HeLa cells significantly reduced the expression of Dp71. By use of the EMSA technique, the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and the luciferase reporter system, we demonstrated that HSF1 can directly bind the HSE in the Dp71 promoter region. We concluded from our data that HSF1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of Dp71 expression.

Abstract: The stress-activated transcription factor, heat shock factor-1 (HSF1), regulates many genes including cytoprotective heat shock proteins (HSPs). We hypothesized that polymorphisms in HSF1 may alter the level or function of HSF1 protein accounting for interindividual viability in disease susceptibility or prognosis. We searched for exomic variants in HSF1 by querying human genome databases and directly sequencing DNA from 80 anonymous genomic DNA samples. Overall, HSF1 sequence was highly conserved, with no common variations. We found 31 validated deviations from a reference sequence in the dbSNP database and an additional 5 novel variants by sequencing, with allele frequencies that were 0.06 or less. Of these 36, 2 were in 5′-untranslated region (5′UTR), 10 in 3′UTR, and 24 in the coding region. The potential effects of 5′UTR on secondary structure, protein structure/function, and 3′UTR targets of microRNAs were analyzed using RNAFold, PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and MicroSNiper. One of the 5′UTR variants was predicted to strengthen secondary structure. Eight of 3′UTR variants were predicted to modify microRNA target sequences. Eight of the coding region variants were predicted to modify HSF1 structure/function. Reducing HSF1 levels in A549 cells using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) increased sensitivity to heat-induced killing demonstrating the impact that genetic variants that reduce HSF1 levels might have. Using the pmirGLO expression system, we found that the wild-type HSF1 3′UTR suppressed translation of a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid by 65 %. Introducing two of four 3′UTR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) increased HSF1 3′UTR translational suppression by 27–44 % compared with the wild-type HSF1 3′UTR sequence while a third SNP reduced suppression by 25 %. HSF1 variants may alter HSF1 protein levels or function with potential effects on cell functions, including sensitivity to stress.

Abstract: Summary
During red-blood-cell-stage infection of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite undergoes repeated rounds of replication, egress, and invasion. Erythrocyte invasion involves specific interactions between host cell receptors and parasite ligands and coordinated expression of genes specific to this step of the life cycle. We show that a parasite-specific bromodomain protein, PfBDP1, binds to chromatin at transcriptional start sites of invasion-related genes and directly controls their expression. Conditional PfBDP1 knockdown causes a dramatic defect in parasite invasion and growth and results in transcriptional downregulation of multiple invasion-related genes at a time point critical for invasion. Conversely, PfBDP1 overexpression enhances expression of these same invasion-related genes. PfBDP1 binds to acetylated histone H3 and a second bromodomain protein, PfBDP2, suggesting a potential mechanism for gene recognition and control. Collectively, these findings show that PfBDP1 critically coordinates expression of invasion genes and indicate that targeting PfBDP1 could be an invaluable tool in malaria eradication.

Abstract: Summary
STING is an ER-associated membrane protein that is critical for innate immune sensing of pathogens. STING-mediated activation of the IFN-I pathway through the TBK1/IRF3 signaling axis involves both cyclic-dinucleotide binding and its translocation from the ER to vesicles. However, how these events are coordinated, and the exact mechanism of STING activation, remain poorly understood. Here, we found that the Shigella effector protein IpaJ potently inhibits STING signaling by blocking its translocation from the ER to ERGIC, even in the context of dinucleotide binding. Reconstitution using purified components revealed STING translocation as the rate-limiting event in maximal signal transduction. Furthermore, STING mutations associated with autoimmunity in humans were found to cause constitutive ER exit and to activate STING independent of cGAMP binding. Together, these data provide compelling evidence for an ER retention and ERGIC/Golgi-trafficking mechanism of STING regulation that is subverted by bacterial pathogens and is deregulated in human genetic disease.

Abstract: Generation of artificial cells provides the bridge needed to cover the gap between studying the complexity of biological processes in whole cells and studying these same processes in an in vitro reconstituted system. Artificial cells are defined as the encapsulation of biologically active material in a biological or synthetic membrane. Here, we describe a robust and general method to produce artificial cells for the purpose of mimicking one or more behaviors of a cell. A microfluidic double emulsion system is used to encapsulate a mammalian cell-free expression system that is able to express membrane proteins into the bilayer or soluble proteins inside the vesicles. The development of a robust platform that allows the assembly of artificial cells is valuable in understanding subcellular functions and emergent behaviors in a more cell-like environment as well as for creating novel signaling pathways to achieve specific cellular behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria is an asymmetric lipid bilayer that serves as a barrier to the environment. During infection, Gram-negative bacteria remodel their OM to promote survival and replication within host tissues. Salmonella rely on the PhoPQ two-component regulators to coordinate OM remodeling in response to environmental cues. In a screen for mediators of PhoPQ-regulated OM remodeling in Salmonella Typhimurium, we identified PbgA, a periplasmic domain-containing transmembrane protein, which binds cardiolipin glycerophospholipids near the inner membrane and promotes their PhoPQ-regulated trafficking to the OM. Purified-PbgA oligomers are tetrameric, and the periplasmic domain contains a globular region that binds to the OM in a PhoPQ-dependent manner. Thus, PbgA forms a complex that may bridge the envelope for regulated cardiolipin delivery. PbgA globular region-deleted mutant bacteria are severely attenuated for pathogenesis, suggesting that increased cardiolipin trafficking to the OM is necessary for Salmonella to survive within host tissues that activate PhoPQ.

Abstract: Summary
In response to tissue injury, hyaluronan (HA) polymers are cleaved by host hyaluronidases, generating small fragments that ligate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to elicit inflammatory responses. Pathogenic bacteria such as group B Streptococcus (GBS) express and secrete hyaluronidases as a mechanism for tissue invasion, but it is not known how this activity relates to immune detection of HA. We found that bacterial hyaluronidases secreted by GBS and other Gram-positive pathogens degrade pro-inflammatory HA fragments to their component disaccharides. In addition, HA disaccharides block TLR2/4 signaling elicited by both host-derived HA fragments and other TLR2/4 ligands, including lipopolysaccharide. Application of GBS hyaluronidase or HA disaccharides reduced pulmonary pathology and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in an acute lung injury model. We conclude that breakdown of host-generated pro-inflammatory HA fragments to disaccharides allows bacterial pathogens to evade immune detection and could be exploited as a strategy to treat inflammatory diseases.
