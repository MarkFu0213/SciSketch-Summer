Abstract: Mitochondria play a central role in glucose metabolism and the stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. In this review, we discuss firstly the regulation and roles of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in glucose-regulated insulin secretion, and the molecular machinery involved. Next, we discuss the evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction in β-cells is associated with type 2 diabetes, from a genetic, functional and structural point of view, and then the possibility that these changes may in part be mediated by dysregulation of cytosolic Ca2+. Finally, we review the importance of preserved mitochondrial structure and dynamics for mitochondrial gene expression and their possible relevance to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Human dendritic cells (DCs) comprise subsets with distinct phenotypic and functional characteristics, but the transcriptional programs that dictate their identity remain elusive. Here, we analyze global chromatin accessibility profiles across resting and stimulated human DC subsets by means of the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq). We uncover specific regions of chromatin accessibility for each subset and transcriptional regulators of DC function. By comparing plasmacytoid DC responses to IFN-I-producing and non-IFN-I-producing conditions, we identify genetic programs related to their function. Finally, by intersecting chromatin accessibility with genome-wide association studies, we recognize DC subset-specific enrichment of heritability in autoimmune diseases. Our results unravel the basis of human DC subset heterogeneity and provide a framework for their analysis in disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Early-life adversity (ELA) is associated with lifelong memory deficits, yet the responsible mechanisms remain unclear. We impose ELA by rearing rat pups in simulated poverty, assess hippocampal memory, and probe changes in gene expression, their transcriptional regulation, and the consequent changes in hippocampal neuronal structure. ELA rats have poor hippocampal memory and stunted hippocampal pyramidal neurons associated with ~140 differentially expressed genes. Upstream regulators of the altered genes include glucocorticoid receptor and, unexpectedly, the transcription factor neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF/REST). NRSF contributes critically to the memory deficits because blocking its function transiently following ELA rescues spatial memory and restores the dendritic arborization of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in ELA rats. Blocking NRSF function in vitro augments dendritic complexity of developing hippocampal neurons, suggesting that NRSF represses genes involved in neuronal maturation. These findings establish important, surprising contributions of NRSF to ELA-induced transcriptional programming that disrupts hippocampal maturation and memory function.

Abstract: Summary
Childhood obesity, especially in girls, is frequently bound to earlier puberty, which is linked to higher disease burden later in life. The mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. Here we show that brain ceramides participate in the control of female puberty and contribute to its alteration in early-onset obesity in rats. Postnatal overweight caused earlier puberty and increased hypothalamic ceramide content, while pharmacological activation of ceramide synthesis mimicked the pubertal advancement caused by obesity, specifically in females. Conversely, central blockade of de novo ceramide synthesis delayed puberty and prevented the effects of the puberty-activating signal, kisspeptin. This phenomenon seemingly involves a circuit encompassing the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and ovarian sympathetic innervation. Early-onset obesity enhanced PVN expression of SPTLC1, a key enzyme for ceramide synthesis, and advanced the maturation of the ovarian noradrenergic system. In turn, obesity-induced pubertal precocity was reversed by virogenetic suppression of SPTLC1 in the PVN. Our data unveil a pathway, linking kisspeptin, PVN ceramides, and sympathetic ovarian innervation, as key for obesity-induced pubertal precocity.

Abstract: Summary
The ever-increasing therapeutic and pharmaceutical demand for liver cells calls for systems that enable mass production of hepatic cells. Here we describe a large-scale suspension system that uses human endoderm stem cells (hEnSCs) as precursors to generate functional and transplantable hepatocytes (E-heps) or cholangiocytes (E-chos). hEnSC-derived hepatic populations are characterized by single-cell transcriptomic analyses and compared with hESC-derived counterparts, in-vitro-maintained or -expanded primary hepatocytes and adult cells, which reveals that hepatic differentiation of hEnSCs recapitulates in vivo development and that the heterogeneities of the resultant populations can be manipulated by regulating the EGF and MAPK signaling pathways. Functional assessments demonstrate that E-heps and E-chos possess properties comparable with adult counterparts and that, when transplanted intraperitoneally, encapsulated E-heps were able to rescue rats with acute liver failure. Our study lays the foundation for cell-based therapeutic agents and in vitro applications for liver diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Determining genes that orchestrate cell differentiation in development and disease remains a fundamental goal of cell biology. This study establishes a genome-wide metric based on the gene-repressive trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) across hundreds of diverse cell types to identify genetic regulators of cell differentiation. We introduce a computational method, TRIAGE, which uses discordance between gene-repressive tendency and expression to identify genetic drivers of cell identity. We apply TRIAGE to millions of genome-wide single-cell transcriptomes, diverse omics platforms, and eukaryotic cells and tissue types. Using a wide range of data, we validate the performance of TRIAGE in identifying cell-type-specific regulatory factors across diverse species including human, mouse, boar, bird, fish, and tunicate. Using CRISPR gene editing, we use TRIAGE to experimentally validate RNF220 as a regulator of Ciona cardiopharyngeal development and SIX3 as required for differentiation of endoderm in human pluripotent stem cells. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumour originating in the CNS. Median patient survival is <15 months with standard treatment which consists of surgery alongside radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. However, because of the aggressive nature of GBM, and the significant toxicity of these adjuvant therapies, long-term therapeutic effects are unsatisfactory. Thus, there is urgency to identify new drug targets for GBM. Recent evidence shows that the transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) cation channel is aberrantly upregulated in GBM and its inhibition leads to reduction of GBM cellular functions. This suggests that TRPM7 may be a potential drug target for GBM treatment. In this study, we assessed the effects of the specific TRPM7 antagonist waixenicin A on human GBM cell lines U87 or U251 both in vitro and in vivo. First, we demonstrated in vitro that application of waixenicin A reduced TRPM7 protein expression and inhibited the TRPM7-like currents in GBM cells. We also observed reduction of GBM cell viability, migration, and invasion. Using an intracranial xenograft GBM mouse model, we showed that with treatment of waixenicin A, there was increased cleaved caspase 3 activity, alongside reduction in Ki-67, cofilin, and Akt activity in vivo. Together, these data demonstrate higher GBM cell apoptosis, and lower proliferation, migration, invasion and survivability following treatment with waixenicin A.

Abstract: Summary
The etiology of congenital heart defects (CHDs), which are among the most common human birth defects, is poorly understood because of its complex genetic architecture. Here, we show that two genes implicated in CHDs, Megf8 and Mgrn1, interact genetically and biochemically to regulate the strength of Hedgehog signaling in target cells. MEGF8, a transmembrane protein, and MGRN1, a RING superfamily E3 ligase, assemble to form a receptor-like ubiquitin ligase complex that catalyzes the ubiquitination and degradation of the Hedgehog pathway transducer Smoothened. Homozygous Megf8 and Mgrn1 mutations increased Smoothened abundance and elevated sensitivity to Hedgehog ligands. While mice heterozygous for loss-of-function Megf8 or Mgrn1 mutations were normal, double heterozygous embryos exhibited an incompletely penetrant syndrome of CHDs with heterotaxy. Thus, genetic interactions can arise from biochemical mechanisms that calibrate morphogen signaling strength, a conclusion broadly relevant for the many human diseases in which oligogenic inheritance is emerging as a mechanism for heritability.

Abstract: Summary
Columns are structural and functional units of the brain. However, the mechanism of column formation remains unclear. The medulla of the fly visual center shares features with the mammalian cerebral cortex, such as columnar and layered structures, and provides a good opportunity to study the mechanisms of column formation. Column formation is initiated by three core neurons in the medulla, namely, Mi1, R8, and R7. The proper orientation of neurons is required for the orientation and arrangement of multiple columns. Their orientations may be under the control of planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, because it is known to regulate the orientation of cells in two-dimensional tissue structures. In this study, we demonstrate that the ligands DWnt4 and DWnt10 expressed specifically in the ventral medulla and dorsal medulla, respectively, globally regulate the columnar arrangement and orientation of Mi1 and R8 terminals through Fz2/PCP signaling in a three-dimensional space.

Abstract: Summary
Adipocytes control bone mass, but the mechanism is unclear. To explore the effect of postnatal adipocyte elimination on bone cells, we mated mice expressing an inducible primate diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) to those bearing adiponectin (ADQ)-Cre. DTR activation eliminates peripheral and marrow adipocytes in these DTRADQ mice. Within 4 days of DTR activation, the systemic bone mass of DTRADQ mice began to increase due to stimulated osteogenesis, with a 1,000% expansion by 10–14 days post-DTR treatment. This adipocyte ablation-mediated enhancement of skeletal mass reflected bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor activation following the elimination of its inhibitors, associated with simultaneous epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signaling. DTRADQ-induced osteosclerosis is not due to ablation of peripheral adipocytes but likely reflects the elimination of marrow ADQ-expressing cells. Thus, anabolic drugs targeting BMP receptor inhibitors with short-term EGF receptor activation may be a means of profoundly increasing skeletal mass to prevent or reverse pathological bone loss.

Abstract: Summary
Lipolysis, the breakdown of triglyceride storage in white adipose tissue, supplies fatty acids to other tissues as a fuel under fasting conditions. In morbid obesity, fibrosis limits adipocyte expandability, resulting in enforced lipolysis, ectopic fat distribution, and ultimately insulin resistance. Although basal levels of lipolysis persist even after feeding, the regulatory mechanisms of basal lipolysis remain unclear. Here, we show the important role of adipocyte prostaglandin (PG) E2-EP4 receptor signaling in controlling basal lipolysis, fat distribution, and collagen deposition during feeding-fasting cycles. The PGE2-synthesis pathway in adipocytes, which is coupled with lipolysis, is activated by insulin during feeding. By regulating the lipolytic key players, the PGE2-EP4 pathway sustains basal lipolysis as a negative feedback loop of insulin action, and perturbation of this process leads to “metabolically healthy obesity.” The potential role of the human EP4 receptor in lipid regulation was also suggested through genotype-phenotype association analyses.

Abstract: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) plays an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis in response to environmental stress. Under conditions of hypoxia or xenobiotic exposure, ARNT regulates the subset of genes involved in adaptive responses, by forming heterodimers with hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF1α and HIF2α) or aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Here, we have shown that ARNT interacts with DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor 15 (DCAF15), and the aryl sulfonamides, indisulam and E7820, induce its proteasomal degradation through Cullin-RING finger ligase 4 containing DCAF15 (CRL4DCAF15) E3 ligase. Moreover, the two known neo-substrates of aryl sulfonamide, RNA-binding motif protein 39 (RBM39) and RNA-binding motif protein 23 (RBM23), are not required for ARNT degradation. In line with this finding, aryl sulfonamides inhibited the transcriptional activities of HIFs and AhR associated with ARNT. Our results collectively support novel regulatory roles of aryl sulfonamides in both hypoxic and xenobiotic responses.

Abstract: Regucalcin plays a multifunctional role in cell regulation as a suppressor in the processes of intracellular signaling and transcription, leading to inhibition of cell growth. The downregulated expression or activity of regucalcin has been shown to contribute to the development of carcinogenesis in various types of human cancer. The wild-type tumor suppressor TP53 gene encodes for a transcriptional factor p53. This protein may play a role in cell proliferation. Loss of p53 function may induce cell transformation during carcinogenesis and tumor progression of human cancer. We investigate whether or not extracellular regucalcin suppresses the proliferation of non-tumorigenic human mammary epithelial MCF 10A cells with loss of p53 in vitro. Loss of p53 did not impact colony formation and proliferation of the cells. Interestingly, p53 loss caused decrease in the cell cycle suppressor p21, but not retinoblastoma and regucalcin, as compared with those of wild-type MCF 10A cells. Notably, extracellular regucalcin suppressed colony formation and proliferation of wild-type MCF 10A cells and p53 (-/-) cells, while it did not have an effect on cell death. Mechanistically, extracellular regucalcin decreased levels of various signaling factors including Ras, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospho-MAPK, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in wild-type MCF 10A cells and p53 (-/-) cells. Thus, extracellular regucalcin was found to suppress the growth of MCF 10A cells with loss of p53. Extracellular regucalcin may play a role as a suppressor in the growth of human mammary epithelial cells with p53 loss, providing a novel strategy for cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Accurately profiling systemic immune responses to cancer initiation and progression is necessary for understanding tumor surveillance and, ultimately, improving therapy. Here, we describe the SYLARAS software tool (systemic lymphoid architecture response assessment) and a dataset collected with SYLARAS that describes the frequencies of immune cells in primary and secondary lymphoid organs and in the tumor microenvironment of mice engrafted with a standard syngeneic glioblastoma (GBM) model. The data resource involves profiles of 5 lymphoid tissues in 48 mice and shows that GBM causes wide-spread changes in the local and systemic immune architecture. We use SYLARAS to identify a subset of CD45R/B220+ CD8+ T cells that is depleted from circulation but accumulates in the tumor mass and confirm this finding using multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy. SYLARAS is freely available for download at (https://github.com/gjbaker/sylaras). A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the Supplemental Information.

Abstract: Altered dendritic morphology is frequently observed in various neurological disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but the cellular and molecular basis underlying these pathogenic dendritic abnormalities remains largely unclear. In this study, we investigated dendritic morphological defects caused by dipeptide repeat protein (DPR) toxicity associated with G4C2 expansion mutation of C9orf72 (the leading genetic cause of ALS and FTD) in Drosophila neurons and characterized the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Among the five DPRs produced by repeat-associated non-ATG translation of G4C2 repeats, we found that arginine-rich DPRs (PR and GR) led to the most significant reduction in dendritic branches and plasma membrane (PM) supply in Class IV dendritic arborization (C4 da) neurons. Furthermore, expression of PR and GR reduced the number of Golgi outposts (GOPs) in dendrites. In Drosophila brains, expression of PR, but not GR, led to a significant reduction in the mRNA level of CrebA, a transcription factor regulating the formation of GOPs. Overexpressing CrebA in PR-expressing C4 da neurons mitigated PM supply defects and restored the number of GOPs, but the number of dendritic branches remained unchanged, suggesting that other molecules besides CrebA may be involved in dendritic branching. Taken together, our results provide valuable insight into the understanding of dendritic pathology associated with C9-ALS/FTD.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor p53 regulates multiple metabolic pathways at the cellular level. However, its role in the context of a whole animal response to metabolic stress is poorly understood. Using Drosophila, we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent Dmp53 activation is critical for sensing nutrient stress, maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and extending organismal survival. Under both nutrient deprivation and high-sugar diet, Dmp53 activation in the fat body represses expression of the Drosophila Leptin analog, Unpaired-2 (Upd2), which remotely controls Dilp2 secretion in insulin-producing cells. In starved Dmp53-depleted animals, elevated Upd2 expression in adipose cells and activation of Upd2 receptor Domeless in the brain result in sustained Dilp2 circulating levels and impaired autophagy induction at a systemic level, thereby reducing nutrient stress survival. These findings demonstrate an essential role for the AMPK-Dmp53 axis in nutrient stress responses and expand the concept that adipose tissue acts as a sensing organ that orchestrates systemic adaptation to nutrient status.

Abstract: Summary
Bat cells and tissue have elevated basal expression levels of antiviral genes commonly associated with interferon alpha (IFNα) signaling. Here, we show Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF1), 3, and 7 levels are elevated in most bat tissues and that, basally, IRFs contribute to the expression of type I IFN ligands and high expression of interferon regulated genes (IRGs). CRISPR knockout (KO) of IRF 1/3/7 in cells reveals distinct subsets of genes affected by each IRF in an IFN-ligand signaling-dependent and largely independent manner. As the master regulators of innate immunity, the IRFs control the kinetics and maintenance of the IRG response and play essential roles in response to influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Melaka virus/Pteropine orthoreovirus 3 Melaka (PRV3M), and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. With its differential expression in bats compared to that in humans, this highlights a critical role for basal IRF expression in viral responses and potentially immune cell development in bats with relevance for IRF function in human biology.

Abstract: Summary
Shoot formation is accompanied by active cell proliferation and expansion, requiring that metabolic state adapts to developmental control. Despite the importance of such metabolic reprogramming, it remains unclear how development and metabolism are integrated. Here, we show that disruption of ANGUSTIFOLIA3 orthologs (PpAN3s) compromises gametophore shoot formation in the moss Physcomitrium patens due to defective cell proliferation and expansion. Trans-omics analysis reveals that the downstream activity of PpAN3 is linked to arginine metabolism. Elevating arginine level by chemical treatment leads to stunted gametophores and causes Ppan3 mutant-like transcriptional changes in the wild-type plant. Furthermore, ectopic expression of AtAN3 from Arabidopsis thaliana ameliorates the defective arginine metabolism and promotes gametophore formation in Ppan3 mutants. Together, these findings indicate that arginine metabolism is a key pathway associated with gametophore formation and provide evolutionary insights into the establishment of the shoot system in land plants through the integration of developmental and metabolic processes.

Abstract: TRPV3 is a Ca2+-permeable cation channel, prominently expressed by keratinocytes where it contributes to maintaining the skin barrier, skin regeneration, and keratinocyte differentiation. However, much less is known about its physiological function in other tissues and there is still a need for identifying novel and efficient TRPV3 channel blockers. By screening a compound library, we identified 26E01 as a novel TRPV3 blocker. 26E01 blocks heterologously expressed TRPV3 channels overexpressed in HEK293 cells as assessed by fluorometric intracellular free Ca2+ assays (IC50 = 8.6 μM) but does not affect TRPV1, TRPV2 or TRPV4 channels. Electrophysiological whole-cell recordings confirmed the reversible block of TRPV3 currents by 26E01, which was also effective in excised inside-out patches, hinting to a rather direct mode of action. 26E01 suppresses endogenous TRPV3 currents in the mouse 308 keratinocyte cell line and in the human DLD-1 colon carcinoma cell line (IC50 = 12 μM). In sections of the gastrointestinal epithelium of mice, the expression of TRPV3 mRNA follows a gradient along the gastrointestinal tract, with the highest expression in the distal colon. 26E01 efficiently attenuates 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate-induced calcium influx in primary colonic epithelial cells isolated from the distal colon. As 26E01 neither shows toxic effects on DLD-1 cells at concentrations of up to 100 μM in MTT assays nor on mouse primary colonic crypts as assessed by calcein-AM/propidium iodide co-staining, it may serve as a useful tool to further study the physiological function of TRPV3 in various tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cells reside in specialized niches that are critical for their function. Upon activation, hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) exit their niche to generate the outer root sheath (ORS), but a subset of ORS progeny returns to the niche to resume an SC state. Mechanisms of this fate reversibility are unclear. We show that the ability of ORS cells to return to the SC state requires suppression of a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation and glutamine metabolism that occurs during early HFSC lineage progression. HFSC fate reversibility and glutamine metabolism are regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)-Akt signaling axis within the niche. Deletion of mTORC2 results in a failure to re-establish the HFSC niche, defective hair follicle regeneration, and compromised long-term maintenance of HFSCs. These findings highlight the importance of spatiotemporal control of SC metabolic states in organ homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Cell size control emerges from a regulated balance between the rates of cell growth and division. In bacteria, simple quantitative laws connect cellular growth rate to ribosome abundance. However, it remains poorly understood how translation regulates bacterial cell size and shape under growth perturbations. Here, we develop a whole-cell model for growth dynamics of rod-shaped bacteria that links ribosomal abundance with cell geometry, division control, and the extracellular environment. Our study reveals that cell size maintenance under nutrient perturbations requires a balanced trade-off between ribosomes and division protein synthesis. Deviations from this trade-off relationship are predicted under translation inhibition, leading to distinct modes of cell morphological changes, in agreement with single-cell experimental data on Escherichia coli. Furthermore, by calibrating our model with experimental data, we predict how combinations of nutrient-, translational-, and shape perturbations can be chosen to optimize bacterial growth fitness and antibiotic resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Although hypertrophy is traditionally regarded as an adaptive response to physiological or pathological stress, prolonged hypertrophy can lead to heart failure. Here we demonstrate that Prdm16 is dispensable for cardiac development. However, it is required in the adult heart to preserve mitochondrial function and inhibit hypertrophy with advanced age. Cardiac-specific deletion of Prdm16 results in cardiac hypertrophy, excessive ventricular fibrosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired metabolic flexibility, leading to heart failure. We demonstrate that Prdm16 and euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase factors (Ehmts) act together to reduce expression of fetal genes reactivated in pathological hypertrophy by inhibiting the functions of the pro-hypertrophic transcription factor Myc. Although young Prdm16 knockout mice show normal cardiac function, they are predisposed to develop heart failure in response to metabolic stress. Our study demonstrates that Prdm16 protects the heart against age-dependent cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical plasticity improves behaviors and helps recover lost functions after injury. However, the underlying synaptic mechanisms remain unclear. In mice, we show that trimming all but one whisker enhances sensory responses from the spared whisker in the barrel cortex and occludes whisker-mediated synaptic potentiation (w-Pot) in vivo. In addition, whisker-dependent behaviors that are initially impaired by single-whisker experience (SWE) rapidly recover when associated cortical regions remap. Cross-linking the surface GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) suppresses the expression of w-Pot, presumably by blocking AMPAR surface diffusion, in mice with all whiskers intact, indicating that synaptic potentiation in vivo requires AMPAR trafficking. We use this approach to demonstrate that w-Pot is required for SWE-mediated strengthening of synaptic inputs and initiates the recovery of previously learned skills during the early phases of SWE. Taken together, our data reveal that w-Pot mediates cortical remapping and behavioral improvement upon partial sensory deafferentation.

Abstract: Summary
Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus and a primary cause of end-stage renal failure. Clinical studies indicate that metabolic surgery improves DN; however, the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) surgery significantly blocked and reversed DN without affecting the insulin signaling pathway. This protective role of RYGB surgery is almost blocked by either inhibition or knockout of 5′AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in podocytes. Furthermore, mRNA microarray data reveal that RYGB surgery obviously reduced the gene expression involved in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAPDH) synthesis. The expression of a key NADPH synthase, hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD), was inhibited by the low plasma corticosterone level after surgery. In addition, blocking NAPDH synthesis by knocking down H6PD mimicked the beneficial role of RYGB surgery through activation of AMPK in podocytes. Therefore, this study demonstrates that reducing NADPH production is critical for renal AMPK activation in response to RYGB surgery.

Abstract: Summary
We used BioID, a proximity-dependent biotinylation assay with 100 mitochondrial baits from all mitochondrial sub-compartments, to create a high-resolution human mitochondrial proximity interaction network. We identified 1,465 proteins, producing 15,626 unique high-confidence proximity interactions. Of these, 528 proteins were previously annotated as mitochondrial, nearly half of the mitochondrial proteome defined by Mitocarta 2.0. Bait-bait analysis showed a clear separation of mitochondrial compartments, and correlation analysis among preys across all baits allowed us to identify functional clusters involved in diverse mitochondrial functions and to assign uncharacterized proteins to specific modules. We demonstrate that this analysis can assign isoforms of the same mitochondrial protein to different mitochondrial sub-compartments and show that some proteins may have multiple cellular locations. Outer membrane baits showed specific proximity interactions with cytosolic proteins and proteins in other organellar membranes, suggesting specialization of proteins responsible for contact site formation between mitochondria and individual organelles.

Abstract: Summary
The cysteine protease inhibitor Cystatin C (CST3) is highly expressed in the brains of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and C57BL/6J mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a model of MS), but its roles in the diseases are unknown. Here, we show that CST3 plays a detrimental function in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG35-55)-induced EAE but only in female animals. Female Cst3 null mice display significantly lower clinical signs of disease compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. This difference is associated with reduced interleukin-6 production and lower expression of key proteins (CD80, CD86, major histocompatibility complex [MHC] II, LC3A/B) involved in antigen processing, presentation, and co-stimulation in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In contrast, male WT and Cst3−/− mice and cells show no differences in EAE signs or APC function. Further, the sex-dependent effect of CST3 in EAE is sensitive to gonadal hormones. Altogether, we have shown that CST3 has a sex-dependent role in MOG35-55-induced EAE.

Abstract: Summary
Knowledge of fundamental differences between breast cancer subtypes has driven therapeutic advances; however, basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) remains clinically intractable. Because BLBC exhibits alterations in DNA repair enzymes and cell-cycle checkpoints, elucidation of factors enabling the genomic instability present in this subtype has the potential to reveal novel anti-cancer strategies. Here, we demonstrate that BLBC is especially sensitive to suppression of iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biosynthesis and identify DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) as an ISC-containing protein that underlies this phenotype. In BLBC cells, POLE suppression leads to replication fork stalling, DNA damage, and a senescence-like state or cell death. In contrast, luminal breast cancer and non-transformed mammary cells maintain viability upon POLE suppression but become dependent upon an ATR/CHK1/CDC25A/CDK2 DNA damage response axis. We find that CDK1/2 targets exhibit hyperphosphorylation selectively in BLBC tumors, indicating that CDK2 hyperactivity is a genome integrity vulnerability exploitable by targeting POLE.

Abstract: Summary
Microtubules are the backbone of the cytoskeleton and vital to numerous cellular processes. The central dogma of microtubules is that all their functions are driven by dynamic instability, but its mechanism has remained unresolved for over 30 years because of conceptual difficulties inherent in the dominant GTP-cap framework. We present a physically rigorous structural mechanochemical model: dynamic instability is driven by non-equilibrium transitions between the bent (B), straight (S), and curved (C) forms of tubulin monomers and longitudinal interfaces in the two-dimensional lattice of microtubule. All the different phenomena (growth, shortening, catastrophe, rescue, and pausing) are controlled by the kinetic pathways for B↔S↔C transitions and corresponding energy landscapes. Different kinetics at minus end are due to different B↔S↔C pathways imposed by the polarity of microtubule lattice. This model enables us to reproduce all the observed phenomena of dynamic instability of purified tubulins in kinetic simulations.

Abstract: Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition with substantial phenotypic and etiological heterogeneity. Although 10%–20% of ASD cases are attributable to copy number variation (CNV), causative genomic loci and constituent genes remain unclarified. We have developed SNATCNV, a tool that outperforms existing tools, to identify 47 recurrent ASD CNV regions from 19,663 cases and 6,479 controls documented in the AutDB database. Analysis of ASD CNV gene content using FANTOM5 shows that constituent coding genes and long non-coding RNAs have brain-enriched patterns of expression. Notably, such enrichment is not observed for regions identified by using other tools. We also find evidence of sexual dimorphism, one locus uniquely comprising a single lncRNA gene, and correlation of CNVs to distinct clinical and behavioral traits. Finally, we analyze a large dataset for schizophrenia to further demonstrate that SNATCNV is an effective, publicly available tool to define genomic loci and causative genes for multiple CNV-associated conditions.

Abstract: Summary
RNA interference (RNAi) is an essential regulatory mechanism in all animals. In Caenorhabditis elegans, several classes of small RNAs act to silence or license expression of mRNA targets. ERI-6/7 is required for the production of some endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and acts as a negative regulator of the exogenous RNAi pathway. We find that the genomic locus encoding eri-6/7 contains two distinct regions that are targeted by endogenous siRNAs. Loss of these siRNAs disrupts eri-6/7 mRNA expression, resulting in increased production of siRNAs from other small RNA pathways because these pathways compete with eri-6/7-dependent transcripts for access to the downstream siRNA amplification machinery. Thus, the pathway acts like a small-RNA-mediated feedback loop to ensure homeostasis of gene expression by small RNA pathways. Similar feedback loops that maintain chromatin homeostasis have been identified in yeast and Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of feedback mechanisms in gene regulatory pathways.

Abstract: Summary
BG505 SOSIP is a well-characterized near-native recombinant HIV Envelope (Env) trimer that holds promise as part of a sequential HIV immunogen regimen to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Rhesus macaques are considered the most appropriate pre-clinical animal model for monitoring antibody (Ab) responses. Accordingly, we report here the isolation of 45 BG505 autologous neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) with multiple specificities from SOSIP-immunized and BG505 SHIV-infected rhesus macaques. We associate the most potent neutralization with two epitopes: the C3/V5 and V1/V3 regions. We show that all of the nAbs bind in close proximity to known bnAb epitopes and might therefore sterically hinder elicitation of bnAbs. We also identify a “public clonotype” that targets the immunodominant C3/V5 nAb epitope, which suggests that common antibody rearrangements might help determine humoral responses to Env immunogens. The results highlight important considerations for vaccine design in anticipation of results of the BG505 SOSIP trimer in clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
A role for cancer cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer is well established. Here, we show that, in addition to cancer cell EMT, ovarian cancer cell metastasis relies on an epigenomic mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in host mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These reprogrammed MSCs, termed carcinoma-associated MSCs (CA-MSCs), acquire pro-tumorigenic functions and directly bind cancer cells to serve as a metastatic driver/chaperone. Cancer cells induce this epigenomic MET characterized by enhancer-enriched DNA hypermethylation, altered chromatin accessibility, and differential histone modifications. This phenomenon appears clinically relevant, as CA-MSC MET is highly correlated with patient survival. Mechanistically, mirroring MET observed in development, MET in CA-MSCs is mediated by WT1 and EZH2. Importantly, EZH2 inhibitors, which are clinically available, significantly inhibited CA-MSC-mediated metastasis in mouse models of ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Cytosolic Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]c) change dynamically in response to inducers, repressors, and physiological conditions, and aberrant [Ca2+]c concentration regulation is associated with cancer, heart failure, and diabetes. Therefore, [Ca2+]c is considered as a good indicator of physiological and pathological cellular responses, and is a crucial biomarker for drug discovery. A genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) was recently developed to measure [Ca2+]c in single cells and animal models. GECI have some advantages over chemically synthesized indicators, although they also have some drawbacks such as poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), low positive signal, delayed response, artifactual responses due to protein overexpression, and expensive detection equipment. Here, we developed an indicator based on interactions between Ca2+-loaded calmodulin and target proteins, and generated an innovative GECI sensor using split nano-luciferase (Nluc) fragments to detect changes in [Ca2+]c. Stimulation-dependent luciferase activities were optimized by combining large and small subunits of Nluc binary technology (NanoBiT, LgBiT:SmBiT) fusion proteins and regulating the receptor expression levels. We constructed the binary [Ca2+]c sensors using a multicistronic expression system in a single vector linked via the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), and examined the detection efficiencies. Promoter optimization studies indicated that promoter-dependent protein expression levels were crucial to optimize SNR and sensitivity. This novel [Ca2+]c assay has high SNR and sensitivity, is easy to use, suitable for high-throughput assays, and may be useful to detect [Ca2+]c in single cells and animal models.

Abstract: Summary
The replication cycle and pathogenesis of the Plasmodium malarial parasite involves rapid expansion in red blood cells (RBCs), and variants of certain RBC-specific proteins protect against malaria in humans. In RBCs, bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) acts as a key allosteric regulator of hemoglobin/oxyhemoglobin. We demonstrate here that a loss-of-function mutation in the murine Bpgm (BpgmL166P) gene confers protection against both Plasmodium-induced cerebral malaria and blood-stage malaria. The malaria protection seen in BpgmL166P mutant mice is associated with reduced blood parasitemia levels, milder clinical symptoms, and increased survival. The protective effect of BpgmL166P involves a dual mechanism that enhances the host’s stress erythroid response to Plasmodium-driven RBC loss and simultaneously alters the intracellular milieu of the RBCs, including increased oxyhemoglobin and reduced energy metabolism, reducing Plasmodium maturation, and replication. Overall, our study highlights the importance of BPGM as a regulator of hemoglobin/oxyhemoglobin in malaria pathogenesis and suggests a new potential malaria therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
The tissue-specific deployment of highly extended neural 3′ UTR isoforms, generated by alternative polyadenylation (APA), is a broad and conserved feature of metazoan genomes. However, the factors and mechanisms that control neural APA isoforms are not well understood. Here, we show that three ELAV/Hu RNA binding proteins (Elav, Rbp9, and Fne) have similar capacities to induce a lengthened 3′ UTR landscape in an ectopic setting. These factors promote accumulation of chromatin-associated, 3′ UTR-extended, nascent transcripts, through inhibition of proximal polyadenylation site (PAS) usage. Notably, Elav represses an unannotated splice isoform of fne, switching the normally cytoplasmic Fne toward the nucleus in elav mutants. We use genomic profiling to reveal strong and broad loss of neural APA in elav/fne double mutant CNS, the first genetic background to largely abrogate this distinct APA signature. Overall, we demonstrate how regulatory interplay and functionally overlapping activities of neural ELAV/Hu RBPs drives the neural APA landscape.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue virus (DENV) infects an estimated 390 million people each year worldwide. As tetravalent DENV vaccines have variable efficacy against DENV serotype 2 (DENV2), we evaluated the role of genetic diversity within the pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins of DENV2 on vaccine performance. We generated a recombinant DENV2 genotype variant panel with contemporary prM and E isolates that are representative of global genetic diversity. The DENV2 genotype variants differ in growth kinetics, morphology, and virion stability. Importantly, the DENV2 genotypic variants are differentially neutralized by monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal serum neutralizing antibodies from DENV2-infected human subjects, and vaccine-elicited antibody responses from the TV003 NIH DENV2 monovalent and DENV tetravalent vaccines. We conclude that DENV2 prM and E genetic diversity significantly modulates antibody neutralization activity. These findings have important implications for dengue vaccines, which are being developed under the assumption that intraserotype variation has minimal impact on neutralizing antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
The structural organization of chromosomes is a crucial feature that defines the functional state of genes and genomes. The extent of structural changes experienced by genomes of eukaryotic cells can be dramatic and spans several orders of magnitude. At the core of these changes lies a unique group of ATPases—the SMC proteins—that act as major effectors of chromosome behavior in cells. The Smc5/6 proteins play essential roles in the maintenance of genome stability, yet their mode of action is not fully understood. Here we show that the human Smc5/6 complex recognizes unusual DNA configurations and uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to promote their compaction. Structural analyses reveal subunit interfaces responsible for the functionality of the Smc5/6 complex and how mutations in these regions may lead to chromosome breakage syndromes in humans. Collectively, our results suggest that the Smc5/6 complex promotes genome stability as a DNA micro-compaction machine.

Abstract: Summary
Local cell contraction pulses play important roles in tissue and cell morphogenesis. Here, we improve a chemo-optogenetic approach and apply it to investigate the signal network that generates these pulses. We use these measurements to derive and parameterize a system of ordinary differential equations describing temporal signal network dynamics. Bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations predict a strong dependence of oscillatory system dynamics on the concentration of GEF-H1, an Lbc-type RhoGEF, which mediates the positive feedback amplification of Rho activity. This prediction is confirmed experimentally via optogenetic tuning of the effective GEF-H1 concentration in individual living cells. Numerical simulations show that pulse amplitude is most sensitive to external inputs into the myosin component at low GEF-H1 concentrations and that the spatial pulse width is dependent on GEF-H1 diffusion. Our study offers a theoretical framework to explain the emergence of local cell contraction pulses and their modulation by biochemical and mechanical signals.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) present with important emotional, cognitive, and social impairments. The gut microbiota has been recently shown to regulate brain functions and behavior but convincing evidence of its role in AUD is lacking. Here, we show that gut dysbiosis is associated with metabolic alterations that affect behavioral (depression, sociability) and neurobiological (myelination, neurotransmission, inflammation) processes involved in alcohol addiction. By transplanting the gut microbiota from AUD patients to mice, we point out that the production of ethanol by specific bacterial genera and the reduction of lipolysis are associated with a lower hepatic synthesis of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which thereby prevents the neuroprotective effect of BHB. We confirm these results in detoxified AUD patients, in which we observe a persisting ethanol production in the feces as well as correlations among low plasma BHB levels and social impairments, depression, or brain white matter alterations.

LET-502/ROCK Regulates Endocytic Recycling by Promoting Activation of RAB-5 in a Distinct Subpopulation of Sorting Endosomes,

Abstract: Summary
To explore the mechanism of Rab5/RAB-5 activation during endocytic recycling, we perform a genome-wide RNAi screen and identify a recycling regulator, LET-502/ROCK. LET-502 preferentially interacts with RAB-5(GDP) and activates RABX-5 GEF activity toward RAB-5, presumably by disrupting the self-inhibiting conformation of RABX-5. Furthermore, we find that the concomitant loss of LET-502 and another CED-10 effector, TBC-2/RAB-5-GAP, results in an endosomal buildup of RAB-5, indicating that CED-10 directs TBC-2-mediated RAB-5 inactivation and re-activates RAB-5 via LET-502 afterward. Then, we compare the functional position of LET-502 with that of RME-6/RAB-5-GEF. Loss of LET-502-RABX-5 module or RME-6 leads to diminished RAB-5 presence in spatially distinct endosome groups. We conclude that in the intestine of C. elegans, RAB-5 resides in discrete endosome subpopulations. Under the oversight of CED-10, LET-502 synergizes with RABX-5 to revitalize RAB-5 on a subset of endosomes in the deep cytosol, ensuring the progress of basolateral recycling.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression is thought to be affected not only by the concentration of transcription factors (TFs) but also the dynamics of their nuclear translocation. Testing this hypothesis requires direct control of TF dynamics. Here, we engineer CLASP, an optogenetic tool for rapid and tunable translocation of a TF of interest. Using CLASP fused to Crz1, we observe that, for the same integrated concentration of nuclear TF over time, changing input dynamics changes target gene expression: pulsatile inputs yield higher expression than continuous inputs, or vice versa, depending on the target gene. Computational modeling reveals that a dose-response saturating at low TF input can yield higher gene expression for pulsatile versus continuous input, and that multi-state promoter activation can yield the opposite behavior. Our integrated tool development and modeling approach characterize promoter responses to Crz1 nuclear translocation dynamics, extracting quantitative features that may help explain the differential expression of target genes.

Abstract: Calcium (Ca2+) is known to stimulate mitochondrial bioenergetics through the modulation of TCA cycle dehydrogenases and electron transport chain (ETC) complexes. This is hypothesized to be an essential pathway of energetic control to meet cellular ATP demand. While regulatory mechanisms of mitochondrial calcium uptake have been reported, it remains unknown if metabolite flux itself feedsback to regulate mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) uptake. This hypothesis was recently tested by Nemani et al. (Sci. Signal. 2020) where the authors report that TCA cycle substrate flux regulates the mitochondrial calcium uniporter channel gatekeeper, mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1), gene transcription in an early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) dependent fashion. They posit this is a regulatory feedback mechanism to control ionic homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics with changing fuel availability. Here, we provide a historical overview of mitochondrial calcium exchange and comprehensive appraisal of these results in the context of recent literature and discuss possible regulatory pathways of mCa2+ uptake and mitochondrial bioenergetics.

Abstract: In contrast to animal cells, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor of Trypanosoma cruzi (TcIP3R) localizes to acidocalcisomes instead of the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we present evidence that TcIP3R is a Ca2+ release channel gated by IP3 when expressed in DT40 cells knockout for all vertebrate IP3 receptors, and is required for Ca2+ uptake by T. cruzi mitochondria, regulating pyruvate dehydrogenase dephosphorylation and mitochondrial O2 consumption, and preventing autophagy. Localization studies revealed its co-localization with an acidocalcisome marker in all life cycle stages of the parasite. Ablation of TcIP3R by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing caused: a) a reduction in O2 consumption rate and citrate synthase activity; b) decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ transport without affecting the membrane potential; c) increased ammonia production and AMP/ATP ratio; d) stimulation of autophagosome formation, and e) marked defects in growth of culture forms (epimastigotes) and invasion of host cells by infective stages (trypomastigotes). Moreover, TcIP3R overexpressing parasites showed decreased metacyclogenesis, trypomastigote host cell invasion and intracellular amastigote replication. In conclusion, the results suggest a modulatory activity of TcIP3R-mediated acidocalcisome Ca2+ release on cell bioenergetics in T. cruzi.

Abstract: Summary
The “omnigenic” model of the genetic architecture of complex traits proposed two categories of causal genes: core and peripheral. Core genes are hypothesized to directly regulate disease and may serve as therapeutic targets. Using a cell-type- and time-point-specific gene co-expression network for mineralizing osteoblasts, we identify a co-expression module enriched for genes implicated by bone mineral density (BMD) genome-wide association studies (GWASs), correlated with in vitro osteoblast mineralization and associated with skeletal phenotypes in human monogenic disease and mouse knockouts. Four genes from this module (B4GALNT3, CADM1, DOCK9, and GPR133) are located within the BMD GWAS loci with colocalizing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and exhibit altered BMD in mouse knockouts, suggesting that they are causal genetic drivers of BMD in humans. Our network-based approach identifies a “core” module for BMD and provides a resource for expanding our understanding of the genetics of bone mass.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial GTP (mtGTP)-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle couples mitochondrial PEPCK (PCK2) to pyruvate kinase (PK) in the liver and pancreatic islets to regulate glucose homeostasis. Here, small molecule PK activators accelerated the PEP cycle to improve islet function, as well as metabolic homeostasis, in preclinical rodent models of diabetes. In contrast, treatment with a PK activator did not improve insulin secretion in pck2−/− mice. Unlike other clinical secretagogues, PK activation enhanced insulin secretion but also had higher insulin content and markers of differentiation. In addition to improving insulin secretion, acute PK activation short-circuited gluconeogenesis to reduce endogenous glucose production while accelerating red blood cell glucose turnover. Four-week delivery of a PK activator in vivo remodeled PK phosphorylation, reduced liver fat, and improved hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed rats. These data provide a preclinical rationale for PK activation to accelerate the PEP cycle to improve metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Multidonor antibodies are of interest for vaccine design because they can in principle be elicited in the general population by a common set of immunogens. For influenza, multidonor antibodies have been observed against the hemagglutinin (HA) stem, but not the immunodominant HA head. Here, we identify and characterize a multidonor antibody class (LPAF-a class) targeting the HA head. This class exhibits potent viral entry inhibition against H1N1 A/California/04/2009 (CA09) virus. LPAF-a class antibodies derive from the HV2-70 gene and contain a “Tyr-Gly-Asp”-motif, which occludes the HA-sialic acid binding site as revealed by a co-crystal structure with HA. Both germline-reverted and mature LPAF antibodies potently neutralize CA09 virus and have nanomolar affinities for CA09 HA. Moreover, increased frequencies for LPFA-a class antibodies are observed in humans after a single vaccination. Overall, this work highlights the identification of a multidonor class of head-directed influenza-neutralizing antibodies and delineates the mechanism of their recurrent elicitation in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through STIM-gated ORAI channels governs vital cellular functions. In this context, SOCE controls cellular redox signaling and is itself regulated by redox modifications. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this calcium-redox interplay and the functional outcomes are not fully understood. Here, we examine the role of STIM2 in SOCE redox regulation. Redox proteomics identify cysteine 313 as the main redox sensor of STIM2 in vitro and in vivo. Oxidative stress suppresses SOCE and calcium currents in cells overexpressing STIM2 and ORAI1, an effect that is abolished by mutation of cysteine 313. FLIM and FRET microscopy, together with MD simulations, indicate that oxidative modifications of cysteine 313 alter STIM2 activation dynamics and thereby hinder STIM2-mediated gating of ORAI1. In summary, this study establishes STIM2-controlled redox regulation of SOCE as a mechanism that affects several calcium-regulated physiological processes, as well as stress-induced pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
The long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) plays a critical role in inflammation, tissue repair, and wound healing. Here, we show that PTX3 regulates disease pathogenesis in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). PTX3 expression increases in skin lesions in patients and mice during CL, with higher expression correlating with severe disease. PTX3-deficient (PTX3−/−) mice are highly resistant to L. major and L. braziliensis infections. This enhanced resistance is associated with increases in Th17 and IL-17A responses. The neutralization of IL-17A abolishes this enhanced resistance, while rPTX3 treatment results in decrease in Th17 and IL-17A responses and increases susceptibility. PTX3−/− CD4+ T cells display increased differentiation to Th17 and expression of Th17-specific transcription factors. The addition of rPTX3 suppresses the expression of Th17 transcription factors, Th17 differentiation, and IL-17A production by CD4+ T cells from PTX3−/− mice. Collectively, our results show that PTX3 contributes to the pathogenesis of CL by negatively regulating Th17 and IL-17A responses.

Abstract: Summary
The causative virus of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, uses its nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) to suppress cellular, but not viral, protein synthesis through yet unknown mechanisms. We show here that among all viral proteins, Nsp1 has the largest impact on host viability in the cells of human lung origin. Differential expression analysis of mRNA-seq data revealed that Nsp1 broadly alters the cellular transcriptome. Our cryo-EM structure of the Nsp1-40S ribosome complex shows that Nsp1 inhibits translation by plugging the mRNA entry channel of the 40S. We also determined the structure of the 48S preinitiation complex formed by Nsp1, 40S, and the cricket paralysis virus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) RNA, which shows that it is nonfunctional because of the incorrect position of the mRNA 3′ region. Our results elucidate the mechanism of host translation inhibition by SARS-CoV-2 and advance understanding of the impacts from a major pathogenicity factor of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and directed differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) make it possible to model genetic heart disease in vitro. We apply CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to introduce three RBM20 mutations in iPSCs and differentiate them into iPSC-CMs to establish an in vitro model of RBM20 mutant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In iPSC-CMs harboring a known causal RBM20 variant, the splicing of RBM20 target genes, calcium handling, and contractility are impaired consistent with the disease manifestation in patients. A variant (Pro633Leu) identified by exome sequencing of patient genomes displays the same disease phenotypes, thus establishing this variant as disease causing. We find that all-trans retinoic acid upregulates RBM20 expression and reverts the splicing, calcium handling, and contractility defects in iPSC-CMs with different causal RBM20 mutations. These results suggest that pharmacological upregulation of RBM20 expression is a promising therapeutic strategy for DCM patients with a heterozygous mutation in RBM20.

Abstract: Summary
Processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs) are prominent examples of subcellular, membraneless compartments that are observed under physiological and stress conditions, respectively. We observe that the trimeric PB protein DCP1A rapidly (within ∼10 s) phase-separates in mammalian cells during hyperosmotic stress and dissolves upon isosmotic rescue (over ∼100 s) with minimal effect on cell viability even after multiple cycles of osmotic perturbation. Strikingly, this rapid intracellular hyperosmotic phase separation (HOPS) correlates with the degree of cell volume compression, distinct from SG assembly, and is exhibited broadly by homo-multimeric (valency ≥ 2) proteins across several cell types. Notably, HOPS sequesters pre-mRNA cleavage factor components from actively transcribing genomic loci, providing a mechanism for hyperosmolarity-induced global impairment of transcription termination. Our data suggest that the multimeric proteome rapidly responds to changes in hydration and molecular crowding, revealing an unexpected mode of globally programmed phase separation and sequestration.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis is a recently discovered form of programed cell death caused by the metabolically regulated lipid peroxidation and holds promise for cancer treatment, but its regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we observe that lactate-rich liver cancer cells exhibit enhanced resistance to the ferroptotic damage induced by common ferroptosis inducers such as Ras-selective lethal small molecule 3 (RSL3) and Erastin and that the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1)-mediated lactate uptake could promote ATP production in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and deactivate the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to the upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and the downstream stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase-1 (SCD1) to enhance the production of anti-ferroptosis monounsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, blocking the lactate uptake via hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1)/MCT1 inhibition promotes ferroptosis by activating the AMPK to downregulate SCD1, which may synergize with its acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 4 (ACSL4)-promoting effect to amplify the ferroptotic susceptibility. In vitro and in vivo evidence confirms that lactate regulates the ferroptosis of HCC cells and highlights its translational potential as a therapeutic target for ferroptosis-based tumor treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are derivatives of the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA). SA is well known to regulate plant immunity and development, whereas there have been few reports focusing on the effects of NSAIDs in plants. Our studies here reveal that NSAIDs exhibit largely overlapping physiological activities to SA in the model plant Arabidopsis. NSAID treatments lead to shorter and agravitropic primary roots and inhibited lateral root organogenesis. Notably, in addition to the SA-like action, which in roots involves binding to the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), NSAIDs also exhibit PP2A-independent effects. Cell biological and biochemical analyses reveal that many NSAIDs bind directly to and inhibit the chaperone activity of TWISTED DWARF1, thereby regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and subsequent endosomal trafficking. Our findings uncover an unexpected bioactivity of human pharmaceuticals in plants and provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the cellular action of this class of anti-inflammatory compounds.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosolic proteins are required for regulation of NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase (Nox) isozymes. Here we show that Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing YSC84-like 1 (SH3YL1), as a Nox4 cytosolic regulator, mediates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced H2O2 generation, leading to acute kidney injury. The SH3YL1, Ysc84p/Lsb4p, Lsb3p, and plant FYVE proteins (SYLF) region and SH3 domain of SH3YL1 contribute to formation of a complex with Nox4-p22phox. Interaction of p22phox with SH3YL1 is triggered by LPS, and the complex induces H2O2 generation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in mouse tubular epithelial cells. After LPS injection, SH3YL1 knockout mice show lower levels of acute kidney injury biomarkers, decreased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, decreased infiltration of macrophages, and reduced tubular damage compared with wild-type (WT) mice. The results strongly suggest that SH3YL1 is involved in renal failure in LPS-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mice. We demonstrate that formation of a ternary complex of p22phox-SH3YL1-Nox4, leading to H2O2 generation, induces severe renal failure in the LPS-induced AKI model.

Abstract: Summary
Critical periods—time windows of heightened plasticity in postnatal development—are specific to sensory features and are asynchronous. Whether they are timed by a temporally precise developmental program or are sequentially organized is not known. We use electrophysiology and molecular or sensory manipulations to elucidate the biological constraints on critical period timing. Passive sound exposure shows that the cortical representations of two sound features, pure tone and frequency-modulated sweep (FMS), are not influencing each other. Enhancing inhibition before the critical period for pure tone accelerates it without changing the critical period for FMS. Similarly, delaying the critical period for pure tone with white noise exposure has no effect on the critical period for FMS. However, the critical period for FMS starts only if the one for pure tone has occurred. Together, these results indicate that distinct critical periods, although sequentially organized, can be temporally shifted independently of each other.

Abstract: Summary
ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a post-translational modification that plays pivotal roles in a wide range of cellular processes. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based analysis of ADPr under physiological conditions, without relying on genetic or chemical perturbation, has been hindered by technical limitations. Here, we describe the applicability of activated ion electron transfer dissociation (AI-ETD) for MS-based proteomics analysis of physiological ADPr using our unbiased Af1521 enrichment strategy. To benchmark AI-ETD, we profile 9,000 ADPr peptides mapping to >5,000 unique ADPr sites from a limited number of cells exposed to oxidative stress and identify 120% and 28% more ADPr peptides compared to contemporary strategies using ETD and electron-transfer higher-energy collisional dissociation (EThcD), respectively. Under physiological conditions, AI-ETD identifies 450 ADPr sites on low-abundant proteins, including in vivo cysteine modifications on poly(ADP-ribosyl)polymerase (PARP) 8 and tyrosine modifications on PARP14, hinting at specialist enzymatic functions for these enzymes. Collectively, our data provide insights into the physiological regulation of ADPr.

Abstract: Summary
Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a cardiac hormone controlling blood volume and pressure in mammals. It is still unclear whether ANP controls cold-induced thermogenesis in vivo. Here, we show that acute cold exposure induces cardiac ANP secretion in mice and humans. Genetic inactivation of ANP promotes cold intolerance and suppresses half of cold-induced brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation in mice. While white adipocytes are resistant to ANP-mediated lipolysis at thermoneutral temperature in mice, cold exposure renders white adipocytes fully responsive to ANP to activate lipolysis and a thermogenic program, a physiological response that is dramatically suppressed in ANP null mice. ANP deficiency also blunts liver triglycerides and glycogen metabolism, thus impairing fuel availability for BAT thermogenesis. ANP directly increases mitochondrial uncoupling and thermogenic gene expression in human white and brown adipocytes. Together, these results indicate that ANP is a major physiological trigger of BAT thermogenesis upon cold exposure in mammals.

Abstract: It has been established that excess germ cells in normal and in pathological conditions are removed from testicular tissue by the mechanism of apoptosis. Studies on germ cell apoptosis in avian species are grossly lacking, and there are only a few reports on induced germ cell degenerations in the testis tissue of birds. This study was designed to investigate the process of apoptosis of germ cells in the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica). Germ cell degenerations were investigated in birds of all age groups, namely pre-pubertal, pubertal, adult, and aged. Apoptosis of germ cells in the quails, as shown by hematoxylin & eosin (H&E), TdT dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) assay and electron microscopy, was similar to that observed in previous studies of germ cells and somatic cells of mammalian species. The observed morphological features of these apoptotic cells ranged from irregular plasma and nuclear membranes in the early stage of apoptosis to rupture of the nuclear membrane, condensation of nuclear material, as well as fragments of apoptotic bodies, in later stages of apoptosis. In the TUNEL-positive cell counts, there was a significant difference between the mean cell counts for the four age groups (P < 0.05). Post hoc analysis revealed a highly significant difference in the aged group relative to the pubertal and adult age groups, while the cell counts of the pre-pubertal group were significantly higher than those of the pubertal group. However, there was no significant difference between cell counts of the pre-pubertal and the adult, and between the pre-pubertal and the aged groups.

Abstract: To elucidate the mechanism of action of HOXA11-AS in modulating the cisplatin resistance of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. HOXA11-AS and miR-454-3p expression in NPC tissue and cisplatin-resistant NPC cells were measured via quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. NPC parental cells (C666-1 and HNE1) and cisplatin-resistant cells (C666-1/DDP and HNE1/DDP) were transfected and divided into different groups, after which the MTT method was used to determine the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) of cells treated with different concentrations of cisplatin. Additionally, a clone formation assay, flow cytometry and Western blotting were used to detect DDP-induced changes. Thereafter, xenograft mouse models were constructed to verify the in vitro results. Obviously elevated HOXA11-AS and reduced miR-454-3p were found in NPC tissue and cisplatin-resistant NPC cells. Compared to the control cells, cells in the si-HOXA11-AS group showed sharp decreases in cell viability and IC50, and these results were reversed in the miR-454-3p inhibitor group. Furthermore, HOXA11-AS targeted miR-454-3p, which further targeted c-Met. In comparison with cells in the control group, HNE1/DDP and C666-1/DDP cells in the si-HOXA11-AS group demonstrated fewer colonies, with an increase in the apoptotic rate, while the expression levels of c-Met, p-Akt/Akt and p-mTOR/mTOR decreased. Moreover, the si-HOXA11-AS-induced enhancement in sensitivity to cisplatin was abolished by miR-454-3p inhibitor transfection. The in vivo experiment showed that DDP in combination with si-HOXA11-AS treatment could inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors. Silencing HOXA11-AS can inhibit the c-Met/AKT/mTOR pathway by specifically upregulating miR-454-3p, thus promoting cell apoptosis and enhancing the sensitivity of cisplatin-resistant NPC cells to cisplatin.

Abstract: Summary
Many bacterial pathogens regulate their virulence genes via phase variation, whereby length-variable simple sequence repeats control the transcription or coding potential of those genes. Here, we have exploited this relationship between DNA structure and physiological function to discover a globally acting small RNA (sRNA) regulator of virulence in the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Our study reports the first sRNA whose expression is affected by a variable thymine (T) stretch in its promoter. We show the sRNA post-transcriptionally represses multiple major pathogenicity factors of H. pylori, including CagA and VacA, by base pairing to their mRNAs. We further demonstrate transcription of the sRNA is regulated by the nickel-responsive transcriptional regulator NikR (thus named NikS for nickel-regulated sRNA), thereby linking virulence factor regulation to nickel concentrations. Using in-vitro infection experiments, we demonstrate NikS affects host cell internalization and epithelial barrier disruption. Together, our results show NikS is a phase-variable, post-transcriptional global regulator of virulence properties in H. pylori.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic transformation alters lipid metabolism to sustain tumor growth. We define a mechanism by which cholesterol metabolism controls the development and differentiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Disruption of distal cholesterol biosynthesis by conditional inactivation of the rate-limiting enzyme Nsdhl or treatment with cholesterol-lowering statins switches glandular pancreatic carcinomas to a basal (mesenchymal) phenotype in mouse models driven by KrasG12D expression and homozygous Trp53 loss. Consistently, PDACs in patients receiving statins show enhanced mesenchymal features. Mechanistically, statins and NSDHL loss induce SREBP1 activation, which promotes the expression of Tgfb1, enabling epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Evidence from patient samples in this study suggests that activation of transforming growth factor β signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by cholesterol-lowering statins may promote the basal type of PDAC, conferring poor outcomes in patients.

Abstract: Summary
Dietary emulsifiers carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and polysorbate-80 (P80) disturb gut microbiota, promoting chronic inflammation. Mice with minimal microbiota are protected against emulsifiers’ effects, leading us to hypothesize that these compounds might provoke select pathobionts to promote inflammation. Gnotobiotic wild-type (WT) and interleukin-10 (IL-10)−/− mice were colonized with Crohn’s-disease-associated adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) and subsequently administered CMC or P80. AIEC colonization of GF and altered Schaedler flora (ASF) mice results in chronic intestinal inflammation and metabolism dysregulations when consuming the emulsifier. In IL-10−/− mice, AIEC mono-colonization results in severe intestinal inflammation in response to emulsifiers. Exposure of AIEC to emulsifiers in vitro increases its motility and ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that emulsifiers directly induce expression of clusters of genes that mediate AIEC virulence and promotion of inflammation. To conclude, emulsifiers promote virulence and encroachment of pathobionts, providing a means by which these compounds may drive inflammation in hosts carrying such bacteria.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas systems are bacterial anti-viral systems, and phages use anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) to inactivate these systems. Here, we report a novel mechanism by which AcrIF11 inhibits the type I-F CRISPR system. Our structural and biochemical studies demonstrate that AcrIF11 functions as a novel mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (mART) to modify N250 of the Cas8f subunit, a residue required for recognition of the protospacer-adjacent motif, within the crRNA-guided surveillance (Csy) complex from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The AcrIF11-mediated ADP-ribosylation of the Csy complex results in complete loss of its double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding activity. Biochemical studies show that AcrIF11 requires, besides Cas8f, the Cas7.6f subunit for binding to and modifying the Csy complex. Our study not only reveals an unprecedented mechanism of type I CRISPR-Cas inhibition and the evolutionary arms race between phages and bacteria but also suggests an approach for designing highly potent regulatory tools in the future applications of type I CRISPR-Cas systems.

Abstract: Summary
The need to derive and culture diverse cell or tissue types in vitro has prompted investigations on how changes in culture conditions affect cell states. However, the identification of the optimal conditions (e.g., signaling molecules and growth factors) required to maintain cell types or convert between cell types remains a time-consuming task. Here, we developed EpiMogrify, an approach that leverages data from ∼100 human cell/tissue types available from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics consortia to predict signaling molecules and factors that can either maintain cell identity or enhance directed differentiation (or cell conversion). EpiMogrify integrates protein-protein interaction network information with a model of the cell’s epigenetic landscape based on H3K4me3 histone modifications. Using EpiMogrify-predicted factors for maintenance conditions, we were able to better potentiate the maintenance of astrocytes and cardiomyocytes in vitro. We report a significant increase in the efficiency of astrocyte and cardiomyocyte differentiation using EpiMogrify-predicted factors for conversion conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The pathways for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation diverge greatly among the domains of life. In the Gram-positive model bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, the final maturation steps of the two large ribosomal subunit (50S) rRNAs, 23S and 5S pre-rRNAs, are catalyzed by the double-strand specific ribonucleases (RNases) Mini-RNase III and RNase M5, respectively. Here we present a protocol that allowed us to solve the 3.0 and 3.1 Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy structures of these RNases poised to cleave their pre-rRNA substrates within the B. subtilis 50S particle. These data provide the first structural insights into rRNA maturation in bacteria by revealing how these RNases recognize and process double-stranded pre-rRNA. Our structures further uncover how specific ribosomal proteins act as chaperones to correctly fold the pre-rRNA substrates and, for Mini-III, anchor the RNase to the ribosome. These r-proteins thereby serve a quality-control function in the process from accurate ribosome assembly to rRNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Innate responses of myeloid cells defend against pathogenic bacteria via inducible effectors. Deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) catalyzes the transfer of the N-moiety of spermidine to the lysine-50 residue of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A) to form the amino acid hypusine. Hypusinated EIF5A (EIF5AHyp) transports specific mRNAs to ribosomes for translation. We show that DHPS is induced in macrophages by two gastrointestinal pathogens, Helicobacter pylori and Citrobacter rodentium, resulting in enhanced hypusination of EIF5A. EIF5AHyp was also increased in gastric macrophages from patients with H. pylori gastritis. Furthermore, we identify the bacteria-induced immune effectors regulated by hypusination. This set of proteins includes essential constituents of antimicrobial response and autophagy. Mice with myeloid cell-specific deletion of Dhps exhibit reduced EIF5AHyp in macrophages and increased bacterial burden and inflammation. Thus, regulation of translation through hypusination is a critical hallmark of the defense of eukaryotic hosts against pathogenic bacteria.

T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are crucial for the establishment of germinal centers (GCs) and potent antibody responses. Nevertheless, the T cell-intrinsic factors that are required for the maintenance of already-established Tfh cells and GCs remain largely unknown. Here, we use temporally guided gene ablation in CD4+ T cells to dissect the contributions of the Tfh-associated chemokine receptor CXCR5 and the transcription factor Bcl6. Induced ablation of Cxcr5 has minor effects on the function of established Tfh cells, and Cxcr5-ablated cells still exhibit most of the features of CXCR5+ Tfh cells. In contrast, continued Bcl6 expression is critical to maintain the GC Tfh cell phenotype and also the GC reaction. Importantly, Bcl6 ablation during acute viral infection results in the transdifferentiation of established Tfh into Th1 cells, thus highlighting the plasticity of Tfh cells. These findings have implications for strategies that boost or restrain Tfh cells and GCs in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a multi-subunit Ca2+-activated Ca2+ channel, made up of the pore-forming MCU protein, a metazoan-specific EMRE subunit, and MICU1/MICU2, which mediate Ca2+ activation. It has been established that metazoan MCU requires EMRE binding to conduct Ca2+, but how EMRE promotes MCU opening remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that EMRE controls MCU activity via its transmembrane helix, while using an N-terminal PKP motif to strengthen binding with MCU. Opening of MCU requires hydrophobic interactions mediated by MCU residues near the pore’s luminal end. Enhancing these interactions by single mutation allows human MCU to transport Ca2+ without EMRE. We further show that EMRE may facilitate MCU opening by stabilizing the open state in a conserved MCU gating mechanism, present also in non-metazoan MCU homologs. These results provide insights into the evolution of the uniporter machinery and elucidate the mechanism underlying the physiologically crucial EMRE-dependent MCU activation process.

Abstract: Summary
To determine whether double-strand break (DSB) mobility enhances the physical search for an ectopic template during homology-directed repair (HDR), we tested the effects of factors that control chromatin dynamics, including cohesin loading and kinetochore anchoring. The former but not the latter is altered in response to DSBs. Loss of the nonhistone high-mobility group protein Nhp6 reduces histone occupancy and increases chromatin movement, decompaction, and ectopic HDR. The loss of nucleosome remodeler INO80-C did the opposite. To see whether enhanced HDR depends on DSB mobility or the global chromatin response, we tested the ubiquitin ligase mutant uls1Δ, which selectively impairs local but not global movement in response to a DSB. Strand invasion occurs in uls1Δ cells with wild-type kinetics, arguing that global histone depletion rather than DSB movement is rate limiting for HDR. Impaired break movement in uls1Δ correlates with elevated MRX and cohesin loading, despite normal resection and checkpoint activation.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo signaling pathway maintains organ size and tissue homeostasis via orchestration of cell proliferation and apoptosis. How this pathway triggers cell apoptosis remains largely unexplored. Here, we identify NR4A1 as a target of the Hippo pathway that mediates the pro-apoptotic and anti-tumor effects of the Hippo pathway whereby YAP regulates the transcription, phosphorylation, and mitochondrial localization of NR4A1. NR4A1, in turn, functions as a feedback inhibitor of YAP to promote its degradation, thereby inhibiting the function of YAP during liver regeneration and tumorigenesis. Our studies elucidate a regulatory loop between NR4A1 and YAP to coordinate Hippo signaling activity during liver regeneration and tumorigenesis and highlight NR4A1 as a marker of Hippo signaling, as well as a therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Why endogenous TRPV6 currents are not detectable-what can we learn from bats?,

Abstract: TRPV6 is a calcium selective TRP channel and is expressed in many species. TRPV6 transcripts are abundantly expressed in few tissues but strangely channel properties are only accessible to electrophysiological recordings after overexpression whereas in native tissue functional channel currents seem not to be detectable. Another exceptional property of human and mouse TRPV6 proteins is that the initiation of translation starts from a non-canonical ACG triplet which is translated as methionine. This triplet is located 120 bp upstream of the first in-frame AUG codon of the human/mouse TRPV6 mRNA. In contrast, the TRPV6 gene of bats is initiated from an AUG triplet at the corresponding position of the human ACG. On the basis of these structural nucleotide differences between human and bats we studied the role of the absolute N-Terminus for the regulation of translation by developing chimera and mutants of human/bat TRPV6 channels. The human sequence which is located downstream of the initiation codon slows down ribosomal scanning in 3′ direction. We suggest that the mechanism involves most likely the deceleration of ribosome scanning by stem-loop formation and the use of the common initiator tRNA, tRNAiMet, which is placed onto the inappropriate ACG codon resulting in low protein synthesis. The reduced translation efficiency is important to protect TRPV6 expressing cells from toxic calcium overload. The regulation of the TRPV6 translation in bats may be an adaptation to low calcium amounts present in the natural nutrition. In addition, we show that also the GFP protein can be controlled using the translational mechanism of human TRPV6.

Abstract: The response of adult human bone marrow stromal stem cells to surface topographies generated through femtosecond laser machining can be predicted by a deep neural network. The network is capable of predicting cell response to a statistically significant level, including positioning predictions with a probability P < 0.001, and therefore can be used as a model to determine the minimum line separation required for cell alignment, with implications for tissue structure development and tissue engineering. The application of a deep neural network, as a model, reduces the amount of experimental cell culture required to develop an enhanced understanding of cell behavior to topographical cues and, critically, provides rapid prediction of the effects of novel surface structures on tissue fabrication and cell signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Polymyxin resistance (PR) threatens the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections. PR frequently arises through chemical modification of the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide. Various mutations are implicated in PR, including in three two-component systems—CrrA/B, PmrA/B, and PhoP/Q—and the negative regulator MgrB. Few have been functionally validated. Therefore, here we adapt a CRISPR-Cas9 system to CRKP to elucidate how mutations in clinical CRKP isolates induce PR. We demonstrate that CrrB is a positive regulator of PR, and common clinical mutations lead to the addition of both 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) and phosophethanolamine (pEtN) to lipid A, inducing notably higher polymyxin minimum inhibitory concentrations than mgrB disruption. Additionally, crrB mutations cause a significant virulence increase at a fitness cost, partially from activation of the pentose phosphate pathway. Our data demonstrate the importance of CrrB in high-level PR and establish important differences across crrB alleles in balancing resistance with fitness and virulence.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue stem cells undergo premature senescence under stress, promoting age-related diseases; however, the associated mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that in response to radiation, oxidative stress, or bleomycin, the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBW7 mediates cell senescence and tissue fibrosis through telomere uncapping. FBW7 binding to telomere protection protein 1 (TPP1) facilitates TPP1 multisite polyubiquitination and accelerates degradation, triggering telomere uncapping and DNA damage response. Overexpressing TPP1 or inhibiting FBW7 by genetic ablation, epigenetic interference, or peptidomimetic telomere dysfunction inhibitor (TELODIN) reduces telomere uncapping and shortening, expanding the pulmonary alveolar AEC2 stem cell population in mice. TELODIN, synthesized from the seventh β strand blade of FBW7 WD40 propeller domain, increases TPP1 stability, lung respiratory function, and resistance to senescence and fibrosis in animals chronically exposed to environmental stress. Our findings elucidate a pivotal mechanism underlying stress-induced pulmonary epithelial stem cell senescence and fibrosis, providing a framework for aging-related disorder interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Bi-species, fusion-mediated, somatic cell reprogramming allows precise, organism-specific tracking of unknown lineage drivers. The fusion of Tcf7l1−/− murine embryonic stem cells with EBV-transformed human B cell lymphocytes, leads to the generation of bi-species heterokaryons. Human mRNA transcript profiling at multiple time points permits the tracking of the reprogramming of B cell nuclei to a multipotent state. Interrogation of a human B cell regulatory network with gene expression signatures identifies 8 candidate master regulator proteins. Of these 8 candidates, ectopic expression of BAZ2B, from the bromodomain family, efficiently reprograms hematopoietic committed progenitors into a multipotent state and significantly enhances their long-term clonogenicity, stemness, and engraftment in immunocompromised mice. Unbiased systems biology approaches let us identify the early driving events of human B cell reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is the earliest defect in type 2 diabetes (T2D), preceding and predicting disease development. To what extent this reflects a primary defect or is secondary to tissue cross talk due to changes in hormones or circulating metabolites is unknown. To address this question, we have developed an in vitro disease-in-a-dish model using iPS cells from T2D patients differentiated into myoblasts (iMyos). We find that T2D iMyos in culture exhibit multiple defects mirroring human disease, including an altered insulin signaling, decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and reduced mitochondrial oxidation. More strikingly, global phosphoproteomic analysis reveals a multidimensional network of signaling defects in T2D iMyos going beyond the canonical insulin-signaling cascade, including proteins involved in regulation of Rho GTPases, mRNA splicing and/or processing, vesicular trafficking, gene transcription, and chromatin remodeling. These cell-autonomous defects and the dysregulated network of protein phosphorylation reveal a new dimension in the cellular mechanisms underlying the fundamental defects in T2D.

Abstract: Summary
CellMiner-SCLC (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/) integrates drug sensitivity and genomic data, including high-resolution methylome and transcriptome from 118 patient-derived small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines, providing a resource for research into this “recalcitrant cancer.” We demonstrate the reproducibility and stability of data from multiple sources and validate the SCLC consensus nomenclature on the basis of expression of master transcription factors NEUROD1, ASCL1, POU2F3, and YAP1. Our analyses reveal transcription networks linking SCLC subtypes with MYC and its paralogs and the NOTCH and HIPPO pathways. SCLC subsets express specific surface markers, providing potential opportunities for antibody-based targeted therapies. YAP1-driven SCLCs are notable for differential expression of the NOTCH pathway, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and antigen-presenting machinery (APM) genes and sensitivity to mTOR and AKT inhibitors. These analyses provide insights into SCLC biology and a framework for future investigations into subtype-specific SCLC vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Summary
The immune system makes decisions in response to combinations of multiple microbial inputs. We do not understand the combinatorial logic governing how higher-order combinations of microbial signals shape immune responses. Here, using coculture experiments and statistical analyses, we discover a general property for the combinatorial sensing of microbial signals, whereby the effects of triplet combinations of microbial signals on immune responses can be predicted by combining the effects of single and pairs. Mechanistically, we find that singles and pairs dictate the information signaled by triplets in mouse and human DCs at the levels of transcription, chromatin, and protein secretion. We exploit this simplifying property to develop cell-based immunotherapies prepared with adjuvant combinations that trigger protective responses in mouse models of cancer. We conclude that the processing of multiple input signals by innate immune cells is governed by pairwise effects, which will inform the rationale combination of adjuvants to manipulate immunity.

Abstract: Summary
We present a tiling light sheet microscope compatible with all tissue clearing methods for rapid multicolor 3D imaging of cleared tissues with micron-scale (4 × 4 × 10 μm3) to submicron-scale (0.3 × 0.3 × 1 μm3) spatial resolution. The resolving ability is improved to sub-100 nm (70 × 70 × 200 nm3) via tissue expansion. The microscope uses tiling light sheets to achieve higher spatial resolution and better optical sectioning ability than conventional light sheet microscopes. The illumination light is phase modulated to adjust the position and intensity profile of the light sheet based on the desired spatial resolution and imaging speed and to keep the microscope aligned. The ability of the microscope to align via phase modulation alone also ensures its accuracy for multicolor 3D imaging and makes the microscope reliable and easy to operate. Here we describe the working principle and design of the microscope. We demonstrate its utility by imaging various cleared tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the noisy nature of single cells, multicellular organisms robustly generate different cell types from one zygote. This process involves dynamic cross regulation between signaling and gene expression that is difficult to capture with fixed-cell approaches. To study signaling dynamics and fate specification during preimplantation development, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing the ERK kinase translocation reporter and measured ERK activity in single cells of live embryos. Our results show primarily active ERK in both the inner cell mass and trophectoderm cells due to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. Strikingly, a subset of mitotic events results in a short pulse of ERK inactivity in both daughter cells that correlates with elevated endpoint NANOG levels. Moreover, endogenous tagging of Nanog in embryonic stem cells reveals that ERK inhibition promotes enhanced stabilization of NANOG protein after mitosis. Our data show that cell cycle, signaling, and differentiation are coordinated during preimplantation development.

Abstract: Summary
Like normal hematopoietic stem cells, leukemic stem cells depend on their bone marrow (BM) microenvironment for survival, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We have studied the contribution of nestin+ BM mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to MLL-AF9-driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development and chemoresistance in vivo. Unlike bulk stroma, nestin+ BMSC numbers are not reduced in AML, but their function changes to support AML cells, at the expense of non-mutated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Nestin+ cell depletion delays leukemogenesis in primary AML mice and selectively decreases AML, but not normal, cells in chimeric mice. Nestin+ BMSCs support survival and chemotherapy relapse of AML through increased oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, and glutathione (GSH)-mediated antioxidant defense. Therefore, AML cells co-opt energy sources and antioxidant defense mechanisms from BMSCs to survive chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Although the function of the extracellular region of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) through its interactions with PD-1 on T cells is well studied, little is understood regarding the intracellular domain of PD-L1. Here, we outline a major role for PD-L1 intracellular signaling in the control of dendritic cell (DC) migration from the skin to the draining lymph node (dLN). Using a mutant mouse model, we identify a TSS signaling motif within the intracellular domain of PD-L1. The TSS motif proves critical for chemokine-mediated DC migration to the dLN during inflammation. This loss of DC migration, in the PD-L1 TSS mutant, leads to a significant decline in T cell priming when DC trafficking is required for antigen delivery to the dLN. Finally, the TSS motif is required for chemokine receptor signaling downstream of the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein complex, ERK phosphorylation, and actin polymerization in DCs.

Abstract: Summary
The processes that control where higher eukaryotic cells initiate DNA replication throughout the genome are not understood clearly. In metazoans, the Treslin-MTBP complex mediates critical final steps in formation of the activated replicative helicase prior to initiation of replication. Here, we map the genome-wide distribution of the MTBP subunit of this complex in human cells. Our results indicate that MTBP binds to at least 30,000 sites in the genome. A majority of these sites reside in regions of open chromatin that contain transcriptional-regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers, and super-enhancers), which are known to be preferred areas for initiation of replication. Furthermore, many binding sites encompass two genomic features: a nucleosome-free DNA sequence (e.g., G-quadruplex DNA or AP-1 motif) and a nucleosome bearing histone marks characteristic of open chromatin, such as H3K4me2. Taken together, these findings indicate that Treslin-MTBP associates coordinately with multiple genomic signals to promote initiation of replication.

Abstract: Summary
Underlying mechanisms of how infectious inflammation is resolved by the host are incompletely understood. One hallmark of inflammation resolution is the activation of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that enhance bacterial clearance and promote tissue repair. Here, we reveal α-hemolysin (Hla) from Staphylococcus aureus as a potent elicitor of SPM biosynthesis in human M2-like macrophages and in the mouse peritoneum through selective activation of host 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1). S. aureus-induced SPM formation in M2 is abolished upon Hla depletion or 15-LOX-1 knockdown. Isolated Hla elicits SPM formation in M2 that is reverted by inhibition of the Hla receptor ADAM10. Lipid mediators derived from Hla-treated M2 accelerate planarian tissue regeneration. Hla but not zymosan provokes substantial SPM formation in the mouse peritoneum, devoid of leukocyte infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Besides harming the host, Hla may also exert beneficial functions by stimulating SPM production to promote the resolution of infectious inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Gain-of-function (GOF) variants in K+ channels cause severe childhood epilepsies, but there are no mechanisms to explain how increased K+ currents lead to network hyperexcitability. Here, we introduce a human Na+-activated K+ (KNa) channel variant (KCNT1-Y796H) into mice and, using a multiplatform approach, find motor cortex hyperexcitability and early-onset seizures, phenotypes strikingly similar to those of human patients. Although the variant increases KNa currents in cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons, there is an increase in the KNa current across subthreshold voltages only in inhibitory neurons, particularly in those with non-fast-spiking properties, resulting in inhibitory-neuron-specific impairments in excitability and action potential (AP) generation. We further observe evidence of synaptic rewiring, including increases in homotypic synaptic connectivity, accompanied by network hyperexcitability and hypersynchronicity. These findings support inhibitory-neuron-specific mechanisms in mediating the epileptogenic effects of KCNT1 channel GOF, offering cell-type-specific currents and effects as promising targets for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an infectious disease with multiple severe symptoms, such as fever over 37.5°C, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia. In our research, microRNAs (miRNAs) binding to the genome sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 were identified by bioinformatic tools. Five miRNAs (hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, and hsa-miR-196a-1-3p) were found to commonly bind to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also identified miRNAs that bind to receptor proteins, such as ACE2, ADAM17, and TMPRSS2, which are important for understanding the infection mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. The expression patterns of those miRNAs were examined in hamster lung samples infected by SARS-CoV-2. Five miRNAs (hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-140-3p, and hsa-miR-422a) showed differential expression patterns in lung tissues before and after infection. Especially, hsa-miR-15b-5p and hsa-miR-195-5p showed a large difference in expression, indicating that they may potentially be diagnostic biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Inherited peripheral neuropathy is a heterogeneous group of peripheral neurodegenerative disorders including Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Many peripheral neuropathies often accompany impaired axonal construction and function. To study the molecular and cellular basis of axon-defective peripheral neuropathy, we explore the possibility of using Caenorhabditis elegans, a powerful nematode model equipped with a variety of genetics and imaging tools. In search of potential candidates of C. elegans peripheral neuropathy models, we monitored the movement and the body posture patterns of 26 C. elegans strains with disruption of genes associated with various peripheral neuropathies and compiled a database of their phenotypes. Our assay showed that movement features of the worms with mutations in HSPB1, MFN2, DYNC1H1, and KIF1B human homologues are significantly different from the control strain, suggesting they are viable candidates for C. elegans peripheral neuropathy models.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA-binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) can form pathogenic inclusions in neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD). Over 70 mutations in Fus are linked to ALS/FTLD. In patients, all Fus mutations are heterozygous, indicating that the mutant drives disease progression despite the presence of wild-type (WT) FUS. Here, we demonstrate that ALS/FTLD-linked FUS mutations in glycine (G) strikingly drive formation of droplets that do not readily interact with WT FUS, whereas arginine (R) mutants form mixed condensates with WT FUS. Remarkably, interactions between WT and G mutants are disfavored at the earliest stages of FUS nucleation. In contrast, R mutants physically interact with the WT FUS such that WT FUS recovers the mutant defects by reducing droplet size and increasing dynamic interactions with RNA. This result suggests disparate molecular mechanisms underlying ALS/FTLD pathogenesis and differing recovery potential depending on the type of mutation.

Abstract: Summary
Collective migration is essential for development, wound repair, and cancer metastasis. For most collective systems, “leader cells” determine both the direction and the power of the migration. It has remained unclear, however, how the highly polarized vertebrate epithelium migrates directionally during branching morphogenesis. We show here that, unlike in other systems, front-rear polarity of the mammary epithelium is set up by preferential cell proliferation in the front in response to the FGF10 gradient. This leads to frontal stratification, loss of apicobasal polarity, and leader cell formation. Leader cells are a dynamic population and move faster and more directionally toward the FGF10 signal than do follower cells, partly because of their intraepithelial protrusions toward the signal. Together, our data show that directional migration of the mammary epithelium is a unique multistep process and that, despite sharing remarkable cellular and molecular similarities, vertebrate and invertebrate epithelial branching are fundamentally distinct processes.

Abstract: Summary
Cells, from microbes to mammals, adapt their membrane lipid composition in response to environmental changes to maintain optimal properties. Global patterns of lipidome remodeling are poorly understood, particularly in organisms with simple lipid compositions that can provide insight into fundamental principles of membrane adaptation. Using shotgun lipidomics, we examine the simple yet, as we show here, adaptive lipidome of the plant-associated Gram-negative bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens. We observe that minimally 11 lipids account for 90% of total variability, thus constraining the upper limit of variable lipids required for an adaptive living membrane. Through lipid features analysis, we reveal that acyl chain remodeling is not evenly distributed across lipid classes, resulting in headgroup-specific effects of acyl chain variability on membrane properties. Results herein implicate headgroup-specific acyl chain remodeling as a mechanism for fine-tuning the membrane’s physical state and provide a resource for using M. extorquens to explore the design principles of living membranes.

Abstract: Summary
Uncontrolled self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors induces leukemia. To self-renew, leukemia cells must continuously activate genes that were previously active in their mother cells. Here, we describe the circuitry of a transactivation system responsible for oncogenic self-renewal. MLL recruits RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) to unmethylated CpG-rich promoters by its CXXC domain and activates transcription by transcriptional regulators, including the AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex, DOT1L, and p300/CBP histone acetyl transferases. MOZ also targets a broad range of CpG-rich promoters through association with RNAP2 and MLL. Leukemic fusion proteins such as MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AFX constitutively activate CpG-rich promoters by aberrantly recruiting p300/CBP. Pharmacological inhibition of MLL or DOT1L induces differentiation of MOZ-TIF2-transformed cells. These results reveal that activation of unmethylated CpG-rich promoters mediated by MLL is the central mechanism of oncogenic self-renewal in MOZ-rearranged leukemia and indicate that the molecularly targeted therapies intended for MLL-rearranged leukemia can be applied for MOZ-rearranged leukemia.

Abstract: Summary
Hemopexin (Hx) is a scavenger of labile heme. Herein, we present data defining the role of tumor stroma-expressed Hx in suppressing cancer progression. Labile heme and Hx levels are inversely correlated in the plasma of patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Further, low expression of Hx in PCa biopsies characterizes poorly differentiated tumors and correlates with earlier time to relapse. Significantly, heme promotes tumor growth and metastases in an orthotopic murine model of PCa, with the most aggressive phenotype detected in mice lacking Hx. Mechanistically, labile heme accumulates in the nucleus and modulates specific gene expression via interacting with guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA structures to promote PCa growth. We identify c-MYC as a heme:G4-regulated gene and a major player in heme-driven cancer progression. Collectively, these results reveal that sequestration of labile heme by Hx may block heme-driven tumor growth and metastases, suggesting a potential strategy to prevent and/or arrest cancer dissemination.

Abstract: Summary
Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) govern efficient neuronal communication with muscle cells, relying on proper architecture of specialized postsynaptic compartments. However, the intrinsic mechanism in muscle cells contributing to NMJ development remains unclear. In this study, we reveal that dynamin-2 (Dyn2) is involved in postsynaptic development of NMJs. Mutations of Dyn2 have been linked to human muscular disorder and centronuclear myopathy (CNM), as well as featured with muscle atrophy and defective NMJs, yet the function of Dyn2 at the postsynaptic membrane is largely unknown. We demonstrate that Dyn2 is enriched at the postsynaptic membrane and regulates NMJ development via actin remodeling. Dyn2 functions as an actin-bundling GTPase to regulate podosome turnover and cytoskeletal organization of the postsynaptic apparatus, and CNM-Dyn2 mutations display abnormal actin remodeling and electrophysiological activity of fly NMJs. Altogether, Dyn2 primarily regulates actin cytoskeleton remodeling and NMJ morphogenesis at the postsynaptic membrane, which is distinct from its endocytosis regulatory role at the presynaptic membrane.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that guide the clonally stable random mono-allelic expression of autosomal genes remain enigmatic. We show that (1) mono-allelically expressed (MAE) genes are assorted and insulated from bi-allelically expressed (BAE) genes through CTCF-mediated chromatin loops; (2) the cell-type-specific dynamics of mono-allelic expression coincides with the gain and loss of chromatin insulator sites; (3) dosage of MAE genes is more sensitive to the loss of chromatin insulation than that of BAE genes; and (4) inactive alleles of MAE genes are significantly more insulated than active alleles and are de-repressed upon CTCF depletion. This alludes to a topology wherein the inactive alleles of MAE genes are insulated from the spatial interference of transcriptional states from the neighboring bi-allelic domains via CTCF-mediated loops. We propose that CTCF functions as a typical insulator on inactive alleles, but facilitates transcription through enhancer-linking on active allele of MAE genes, indicating widespread allele-specific regulatory roles of CTCF.

Abstract: Cells assemble stress granules (SGs) to protect their RNAs from exposure to harmful chemical reactions induced by environmental stress. These SGs release RNAs, which resume translation once the stress is relieved. During stem cell differentiation, gene expression is altered to allow cells to adopt various functional and morphological features necessary to differentiate. This process induces stress within a cell, and cells that cannot overcome this stress die. Here, we investigated the role of SGs in the progression of stem cell differentiation. SGs aggregated during the neuronal differentiation of human bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells, and not in cell lines that could not undergo differentiation. SGs were observed between one and three hours post-induction; RNA translation was restrained at the same time. Immediately after disassembly of SGs, the expression of the neuronal marker neurofilament-M (NF-M) gradually increased. Assembled SGs that persisted in cells were exposed to salubrinal, which inhibited the dephosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (eIF2α), and in eIF2α/S51D mutant cells. When eIF2α/S51A mutant cells differentiated, SGs were not assembled. In all experiments, the disruption of SGs was accompanied by delayed NF-M expression and the number of neuronally differentiated cells was decreased. Decreased differentiation was accompanied by decreased cell viability, indicating the necessity of SGs for preventing cell death during neuronal differentiation. Collectively, these results demonstrate the essential role of SGs during the neuronal differentiation of stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Although enhancers play critical roles in cancer, quantifying enhancer activities in clinical samples remains challenging, especially for super-enhancers. Enhancer activities can be inferred from enhancer RNA (eRNA) signals, which requires enhancer transcription loci definition. Only a small proportion of human eRNA loci has been precisely identified, limiting investigations of enhancer-mediated oncogenic mechanisms. Here, we characterize super-enhancer regions using aggregated RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from large cohorts. Super-enhancers usually contain discrete loci featuring sharp eRNA expression peaks. We identify >300,000 eRNA loci in ∼377 Mb super-enhancer regions that are regulated by evolutionarily conserved, well-positioned nucleosomes and are frequently dysregulated in cancer. The eRNAs provide explanatory power for cancer phenotypes beyond that provided by mRNA expression through resolving intratumoral heterogeneity with enhancer cell-type specificity. Our study provides a high-resolution map of eRNA loci through which super-enhancer activities can be quantified by RNA-seq and a user-friendly data portal, enabling a broad range of biomedical investigations.

Abstract: Summary
Necroptosis induction in vitro often requires caspase-8 (Casp8) inhibition by zVAD because pro-Casp8 cleaves RIP1 to disintegrate the necrosome. It has been unclear how the Casp8 blockade of necroptosis is eliminated naturally. Here, we show that pro-Casp8 within the necrosome can be inactivated by phosphorylation at Thr265 (pC8T265). pC8T265 occurs in vitro in various necroptotic cells and in the cecum of TNF-treated mice. p90 RSK is the kinase of pro-Casp8. It is activated by a mechanism that does not need ERK but PDK1, which is recruited to the RIP1-RIP3-MLKL-containing necrosome. Phosphorylation of pro-Casp8 at Thr265 can substitute for zVAD to permit necroptosis in vitro. pC8T265 mimic T265E knockin mice are embryonic lethal due to unconstrained necroptosis, and the pharmaceutical inhibition of RSK-mediated pC8T265 diminishes TNF-induced cecum damage and lethality in mice by halting necroptosis. Thus, phosphorylation of pro-Casp8 at Thr265 by RSK is an intrinsic mechanism for passing the Casp8 checkpoint of necroptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Precise discrimination of tumor from normal tissues remains a major roadblock for therapeutic efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Here, we perform a comprehensive in silico screen to identify multi-antigen signatures that improve tumor discrimination by CAR T cells engineered to integrate multiple antigen inputs via Boolean logic, e.g., AND and NOT. We screen >2.5 million dual antigens and ∼60 million triple antigens across 33 tumor types and 34 normal tissues. We find that dual antigens significantly outperform the best single clinically investigated CAR targets and confirm key predictions experimentally. Further, we identify antigen triplets that are predicted to show close to ideal tumor-versus-normal tissue discrimination for several tumor types. This work demonstrates the potential of 2- to 3-antigen Boolean logic gates for improving tumor discrimination by CAR T cell therapies. Our predictions are available on an interactive web server resource (antigen.princeton.edu).

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria contain their own gene expression systems, including membrane-bound ribosomes dedicated to synthesizing a few hydrophobic subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. We used a proximity-dependent biotinylation technique, BioID, coupled with mass spectrometry to delineate in baker’s yeast a comprehensive network of factors involved in biogenesis of mitochondrial encoded proteins. This mitochondrial gene expression network (MiGENet) encompasses proteins involved in transcription, RNA processing, translation, or protein biogenesis. Our analyses indicate the spatial organization of these processes, thereby revealing basic mechanistic principles and the proteins populating strategically important sites. For example, newly synthesized proteins are directly handed over to ribosomal tunnel exit-bound factors that mediate membrane insertion, co-factor acquisition, or their mounting into OXPHOS complexes in a special early assembly hub. Collectively, the data reveal the connectivity of mitochondrial gene expression, reflecting a unique tailoring of the mitochondrial gene expression system.

K-Ras–Activated Cells Can Develop into Lung Tumors When Runx3-Mediated Tumor Suppressor Pathways Are Abrogated,

Abstract: K-RAS is frequently mutated in human lung adenocarcinomas (ADCs), and the p53 pathway plays a central role in cellular defense against oncogenic K-RAS mutation. However, in mouse lung cancer models, oncogenic K-Ras mutation alone can induce ADCs without p53 mutation, and loss of p53 does not have a significant impact on early K-Ras–induced lung tumorigenesis. These results raise the question of how K-Ras–activated cells evade oncogene surveillance mechanisms and develop into lung ADCs. RUNX3 plays a key role at the restriction (R)-point, which governs multiple tumor suppressor pathways including the p14ARF–p53 pathway. In this study, we found that K-Ras activation in a very limited number of cells, alone or in combination with p53 inactivation, failed to induce any pathologic lesions for up to 1 year. By contrast, when Runx3 was inactivated and K-Ras was activated by the same targeting method, lung ADCs and other tumors were rapidly induced. In a urethane-induced mouse lung tumor model that recapitulates the features of K-RAS–driven human lung tumors, Runx3 was inactivated in both adenomas (ADs) and ADCs, whereas K-Ras was activated only in ADCs. Together, these results demonstrate that the R-point–associated oncogene surveillance mechanism is abrogated by Runx3 inactivation in AD cells and these cells cannot defend against K-Ras activation, resulting in the transition from AD to ADC. Therefore, K-Ras–activated lung epithelial cells do not evade oncogene surveillance mechanisms; instead, they are selected if they occur in AD cells in which Runx3 has been inactivated.
