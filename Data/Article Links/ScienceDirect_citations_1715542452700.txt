Abstract: Summary
Substantia nigra (SNc) dopaminergic neurons respond to aversive stimuli with inhibitory pauses in firing followed by transient rebound activation. We tested integration of inhibitory synaptic inputs onto SNc neurons from genetically defined populations in dorsal striatum (striosome and matrix) and external globus pallidus (GPe; parvalbumin- and Lhx6-positive), and examined their contribution to pause-rebound firing. Activation of striosome projections, which target “dendron bouquets” in the pars reticulata (SNr), consistently quiets firing and relief from striosome inhibition triggers rebound activity. Striosomal inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) display a prominent GABA-B receptor-mediated component that strengthens the impact of SNr dendrite synapses on somatic excitability and enables rebounding. By contrast, GPe projections activate GABA-A receptors on the soma and proximal dendrites but do not result in rebounding. Lastly, optical mapping shows that dorsal striatum selectively inhibits the ventral population of SNc neurons, which are intrinsically capable of rebounding. Therefore, we define a distinct striatonigral circuit for generating dopamine rebound.

Abstract: Summary
Rabies is nearly 100% lethal in the absence of treatment, killing an estimated 59,000 people annually. Vaccines and biologics are highly efficacious when administered properly. Sixteen rabies-related viruses (lyssaviruses) are similarly lethal, but some are divergent enough to evade protection from current vaccines and biologics, which are based only on the classical rabies virus (RABV). Here we present the development and characterization of LyssaVax, a vaccine featuring a structurally designed, functional chimeric glycoprotein (G) containing immunologically important domains from both RABV G and the highly divergent Mokola virus (MOKV) G. LyssaVax elicits high titers of antibodies specific to both RABV and MOKV Gs in mice. Immune sera also neutralize a range of wild-type lyssaviruses across the major phylogroups. LyssaVax-immunized mice are protected against challenge with recombinant RABV and MOKV. Altogether, LyssaVax demonstrates the utility of structural modeling in vaccine design and constitutes a broadened lyssavirus vaccine candidate.

Abstract: Summary
Retinal bipolar cells (BCs) connect with photoreceptors and relay visual information to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Retina-specific deletion of Lhx4 in mice results in a visual defect resembling human congenital stationary night blindness. This visual dysfunction results from the absence of rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and the loss of selective rod-connecting cone bipolar cell (CBC) subtypes and AII amacrine cells (ACs). Inactivation of Lhx4 causes the apoptosis of BCs and cell fate switch from some BCs to ACs, whereas Lhx4 overexpression promotes BC genesis. Moreover, Lhx4 positively regulates Lhx3 expression to drive the fate choice of type 2 BCs over the GABAergic ACs. Lhx4 inactivation ablates Bhlhe23 expression, whereas overexpression of Bhlhe23 partially rescues RBC development in the absence of Lhx4. Thus, by acting upstream of Bhlhe23, Prdm8, Fezf2, Lhx3, and other BC genes, Lhx4, together with Isl1, could play essential roles in regulating the subtype-specific development of RBCs and CBCs.

Abstract: Summary
The presence and potential functions of resident plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in peripheral tissues is unclear. We report that pDCs constitutively populate naïve corneas and are increased during sterile injuries or acute herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) keratitis. Their local depletion leads to severe clinical disease, nerve loss, viral dissemination to the trigeminal ganglion and draining lymph nodes, and mortality, while their local adoptive transfer limits disease. pDCs are the main source of HSV-1-induced IFN-α in the corneal stroma through TLR9, and they prevent re-programming of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to effector ex-Tregs. Clinical signs of infection are observed in pDC-depleted corneas, but not in pDC-sufficient corneas, following low-dose HSV-1 inoculation, suggesting their critical role in corneal antiviral immunity. Our findings demonstrate a vital role for corneal pDCs in the control of local viral infections.

Abstract: Summary
Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) plays a major role in mitochondrial fusion and in the maintenance of mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites. Given that macrophages play a major role in inflammation, we studied the contribution of Mfn2 to the activity of these cells. Pro-inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced Mfn2 expression. The use of the Mfn2 and Mfn1 myeloid-conditional knockout (KO) mouse models reveals that Mfn2 but not Mfn1 is required for the adaptation of mitochondrial respiration to stress conditions and for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon pro-inflammatory activation. Mfn2 deficiency specifically impairs the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. In addition, the lack of Mfn2 but not Mfn1 is associated with dysfunctional autophagy, apoptosis, phagocytosis, and antigen processing. Mfn2floxed;CreLysM mice fail to be protected from Listeria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or LPS endotoxemia. These results reveal an unexpected contribution of Mfn2 to ROS production and inflammation in macrophages.

Abstract: Voltage-gated Kv7 (or KCNQ) channels control activity of excitable cells, including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), by setting their resting membrane potential and controlling other excitability parameters. Excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells is mediated by Ca2+ but until now, the exact role of Kv7 channels in cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics in VSMCs has not been fully elucidated. We utilised microfluorimetry to investigate the impact of Kv7 channel activity on intracellular Ca2+ levels and electrical activity of rat A7r5 VSMCs and primary human internal mammary artery (IMA) SMCs. Both, direct (XE991) and G protein coupled receptor mediated (vasopressin, AVP) Kv7 channel inhibition induced robust Ca2+ oscillations, which were significantly reduced in the presence of Kv7 channel activator, retigabine, L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor, nifedipine, or T-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor, NNC 55-0396, in A7r5 cells. Membrane potential measured using FluoVolt exhibited a slow depolarisation followed by a burst of sharp spikes in response to XE991; spikes were temporally correlated with Ca2+ oscillations. Phospholipase C inhibitor (edelfosine) reduced AVP-induced, but not XE991-induced Ca2+ oscillations. AVP and XE991 induced a large increase of [Ca2+]i in human IMA, which was also attenuated with retigabine, nifedipine and NNC 55-0396. RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology suggested that Kv7.5 was the predominant Kv7 subunit in both rat and human arterial SMCs; CACNA1C (Cav1.2; L-type) and CACNA1 G (Cav3.1; T-type) were the most abundant voltage-gated Ca2+ channel gene transcripts in both types of VSMCs. This study establishes Kv7 channels as key regulators of Ca2+ signalling in VSMCs with Kv7.5 playing a dominant role.

Abstract: Summary
Due to an extreme rarity of 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) in the mammalian genome, investigation of its role brings a considerable challenge. Methods based on bisulfite sequencing have been proposed for genome-wide 5caC analysis. However, bisulfite-based sequencing of scarcely abundant 5caC demands significant experimental and computational resources, increasing sequencing cost. Here, we present a bisulfite-free approach, caCLEAR, for high-resolution mapping of 5caCGs. The method uses an atypical activity of the methyltransferase eM.SssI to remove a carboxyl group from 5caC, generating unmodified CGs, which are localized by uTOP-seq sequencing. Validation of caCLEAR on model DNA systems and mouse ESCs supports the suitability of caCLEAR for analysis of 5caCGs. The 5caCG profiles of naive and primed pluripotent ESCs reflect their distinct demethylation dynamics and demonstrate an association of 5caC with gene expression. Generally, we demonstrate that caCLEAR is a robust economical approach that could help provide deeper insights into biological roles of 5caC.

Abstract: Summary
Gene and protein expression data provide useful resources for understanding brain function, but little is known about the lipid composition of the brain. Here, we perform quantitative shotgun lipidomics, which enables a cell-type-resolved assessment of the mouse brain lipid composition. We quantify around 700 lipid species and evaluate lipid features including fatty acyl chain length, hydroxylation, and number of acyl chain double bonds, thereby identifying cell-type- and brain-region-specific lipid profiles in adult mice, as well as in aged mice, in apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice, in a model of Alzheimer’s disease, and in mice fed different diets. We also integrate lipid with protein expression profiles to predict lipid pathways enriched in specific cell types, such as fatty acid β-oxidation in astrocytes and sphingolipid metabolism in microglia. This resource complements existing brain atlases of gene and protein expression and may be useful for understanding the role of lipids in brain function.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular pH is usually maintained around 7.4 in multicellular organisms, and cells are optimized to proliferate under this condition. Here, we find cells can adapt to a more acidic pH of 6.5 and become addicted to this acidic microenvironment by expressing phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL), a driver of cancer malignancy. Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening and subsequent analyses revealed that PRL promotes H+ extrusion and acid addiction by stimulating lysosomal exocytosis. Further experiments using cultured cells and Caenorhabditis elegans clarified the molecular link between PRL and lysosomal exocytosis across species, involving activation of lysosomal Ca2+ channel TRPML by ROS. Indeed, disruption of TRPML in cancer cells abolished PRL-stimulated lysosomal exocytosis, acid addiction, and metastasis. Thus, PRL is the molecular switch turning cells addicted to an acidic condition, which should benefit cancer cells to thrive in an acidic tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell niches provide a microenvironment to support the self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation of stem cells. Cell-cell interactions within the niche are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. However, the niche cells supporting mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are largely unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show heterogeneity among Gli1+ MSCs and identify a subpopulation of Runx2+/Gli1+ cells in the adult mouse incisor. These Runx2+/Gli1+ cells are strategically located between MSCs and transit-amplifying cells (TACs). They are not stem cells but help to maintain the MSC niche via IGF signaling to regulate TAC proliferation, differentiation, and incisor growth rate. ATAC-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation reveal that Runx2 directly binds to Igfbp3 in niche cells. This Runx2-mediated IGF signaling is crucial for regulating the MSC niche and maintaining tissue homeostasis to support continuous growth of the adult mouse incisor, providing a model for analysis of the molecular regulation of the MSC niche.

Abstract: Summary
High-risk neuroblastomas typically display an undifferentiated or poorly differentiated morphology. It is therefore vital to understand molecular mechanisms that block the differentiation process. We identify an important role for oncogenic ALK-ERK1/2-SP1 signaling in the maintenance of undifferentiated neural crest-derived progenitors through the repression of DLG2, a candidate tumor suppressor gene in neuroblastoma. DLG2 is expressed in the murine “bridge signature” that represents the transcriptional transition state when neural crest cells or Schwann cell precursors differentiate to chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland. We show that the restoration of DLG2 expression spontaneously drives neuroblastoma cell differentiation, highlighting the importance of DLG2 in this process. These findings are supported by genetic analyses of high-risk 11q deletion neuroblastomas, which identified genetic lesions in the DLG2 gene. Our data also suggest that further exploration of other bridge genes may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of NC-derived progenitors and their contribution to neuroblastomas.

Abstract: Summary
The interplay between pancreatic epithelium and the surrounding microenvironment is pivotal for pancreas formation and differentiation as well as adult organ homeostasis. The mesenchyme is the main component of the embryonic pancreatic microenvironment, yet its cellular identity is broadly defined, and whether it comprises functionally distinct cell subsets is not known. Using genetic lineage tracing, transcriptome, and functional studies, we identified mesenchymal populations with different roles during pancreatic development. Moreover, we showed that Pbx transcription factors act within the mouse pancreatic mesenchyme to define a pro-endocrine specialized niche. Pbx directs differentiation of endocrine progenitors into insulin- and glucagon-positive cells through non-cell-autonomous regulation of ECM-integrin interactions and soluble molecules. Next, we measured functional conservation between mouse and human pancreatic mesenchyme by testing identified mesenchymal factors in an iPSC-based differentiation model. Our findings provide insights into how lineage-specific crosstalk between epithelium and neighboring mesenchymal cells underpin the generation of different pancreatic cell types.

Abstract: Summary
FBXL21 is a clock-controlled E3 ligase modulating circadian periodicity via subcellular-specific CRYPTOCHROME degradation. How FBXL21 regulates tissue-specific circadian physiology and what mechanism operates upstream is poorly understood. Here we report the sarcomere component TCAP as a cytoplasmic substrate of FBXL21. FBXL21 interacts with TCAP in a circadian manner antiphasic to TCAP accumulation in skeletal muscle, and circadian TCAP oscillation is disrupted in Psttm mice with an Fbxl21 hypomorph mutation. GSK-3β phosphorylates FBXL21 and TCAP to activate FBXL21-mediated, phosphodegron-dependent TCAP degradation. GSK-3β inhibition or knockdown diminishes FBXL21-Cul1 complex formation and delays FBXL21-mediated TCAP degradation. Finally, Psttm mice show significant skeletal muscle defects, including impaired fiber size, exercise tolerance, grip strength, and response to glucocorticoid-induced atrophy, in conjunction with cardiac dysfunction. These data highlight a circadian regulatory pathway where a GSK-3β-FBXL21 functional axis controls TCAP degradation via SCF complex formation and regulates skeletal muscle function.

Abstract: Summary
In many organs, stem cell function depends on communication with their niche partners. Cranial sensory neurons develop in close proximity to blood vessels; however, whether vasculature is an integral component of their niches is yet unknown. Here, two separate roles for vasculature in cranial sensory neurogenesis in zebrafish are uncovered. The first involves precise spatiotemporal endothelial-neuroblast cytoneme contacts and Dll4-Notch signaling to restrain neuroblast proliferation. The second, instead, requires blood flow to trigger a transcriptional response that modifies neuroblast metabolic status and induces sensory neuron differentiation. In contrast, no role of sensory neurogenesis in vascular development is found, suggesting unidirectional signaling from vasculature to sensory neuroblasts. Altogether, we demonstrate that the cranial vasculature constitutes a niche component of the sensory ganglia that regulates the pace of their growth and differentiation dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane repair is essential for cell and organism survival. Exocytosis and endocytosis facilitate membrane repair in small wounds within a single cell; however, it remains unclear how large wounds in the plasma membrane are repaired in metazoans. Here, we show that wounding triggers rapid transcriptional upregulation and dynamic recruitment of the fusogen EFF-1 to the wound site in C. elegans epidermal cells. EFF-1 recruitment at the wounded membrane depends on the actin cytoskeleton and is important for membrane repair. We identified syntaxin-2 (SYX-2) as an essential regulator of EFF-1 recruitment. SYX-2 interacts with the C terminus of EFF-1 to promote its recruitment, facilitating both endoplasmic and exoplasmic membrane repair. Furthermore, we show that SYX-2-EFF-1 repair machinery acts downstream of the ESCRT III signal. Together, our findings identify a key pathway underlying membrane repair and provide insights into tissue repair and regenerative medicine after injury.

Abstract: Summary
Ependymoma (EPN) is a brain tumor commonly presenting in childhood that remains fatal in most children. Intra-tumoral cellular heterogeneity in bulk-tumor samples significantly confounds our understanding of EPN biology, impeding development of effective therapy. We, therefore, use single-cell RNA sequencing, histology, and deconvolution to catalog cellular heterogeneity of the major childhood EPN subgroups. Analysis of PFA subgroup EPN reveals evidence of an undifferentiated progenitor subpopulation that either differentiates into subpopulations with ependymal cell characteristics or transitions into a mesenchymal subpopulation. Histological analysis reveals that progenitor and mesenchymal subpopulations co-localize in peri-necrotic zones. In conflict with current classification paradigms, relative PFA subpopulation proportions are shown to determine bulk-tumor-assigned subgroups. We provide an interactive online resource that facilitates exploration of the EPN single-cell dataset. This atlas of EPN cellular heterogeneity increases understanding of EPN biology.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) is a major regulator of cardiac functions and is downregulated in the majority of heart failure cases. A key physiological process is the activation of heterotrimeric G-protein Gs by β1-ARs, leading to increased heart rate and contractility. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy and functional studies to investigate the molecular mechanism by which β1-AR activates Gs. We find that the tilting of α5-helix breaks a hydrogen bond between the sidechain of His373 in the C-terminal α5-helix and the backbone carbonyl of Arg38 in the N-terminal αN-helix of Gαs. Together with the disruption of another interacting network involving Gln59 in the α1-helix, Ala352 in the β6-α5 loop, and Thr355 in the α5-helix, these conformational changes might lead to the deformation of the GDP-binding pocket. Our data provide molecular insights into the activation of G-proteins by G-protein-coupled receptors.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer relapse begins when malignant cells pass through the extreme metabolic bottleneck of stress from chemotherapy and the byproducts of the massive cell death in the surrounding region. In acute myeloid leukemia, complete remissions are common, but few are cured. We tracked leukemia cells in vivo, defined the moment of maximal response following chemotherapy, captured persisting cells, and conducted unbiased metabolomics, revealing a metabolite profile distinct from the pre-chemo growth or post-chemo relapse phase. Persisting cells used glutamine in a distinctive manner, preferentially fueling pyrimidine and glutathione generation, but not the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle. Notably, malignant cell pyrimidine synthesis also required aspartate provided by specific bone marrow stromal cells. Blunting glutamine metabolism or pyrimidine synthesis selected against residual leukemia-initiating cells and improved survival in leukemia mouse models and patient-derived xenografts. We propose that timed cell-intrinsic or niche-focused metabolic disruption can exploit a transient vulnerability and induce metabolic collapse in cancer cells to overcome chemoresistance.

Abstract: Summary
Either caspase-1 or caspase-11 can cleave gasdermin D to cause pyroptosis, eliminating intracellular replication niches. We previously showed that macrophages detect Burkholderia thailandensis via NLRC4, triggering the release of interleukin (IL)-18 and driving an essential interferon (IFN)-γ response that primes caspase-11. We now identify the IFN-γ-producing cells as a mixture of natural killer (NK) and T cells. Although both caspase-1 and caspase-11 can cleave gasdermin D in macrophages and neutrophils, we find that NLRC4-activated caspase-1 triggers pyroptosis in macrophages, but this pathway does not trigger pyroptosis in neutrophils. In contrast, caspase-11 triggers pyroptosis in both macrophages and neutrophils. This translates to an absolute requirement for caspase-11 in neutrophils during B. thailandensis infection in mice. We present an example of inflammasome sensors causing diverging outcomes in different cell types. Thus, cell fates are dictated not simply by the pathogen or inflammasome, but also by how the cell is wired to respond to detection events.

Abstract: Summary
The patterns of neuronal connectivity underlying multisensory integration, a fundamental property of many brains, remain poorly characterized. The Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body—an associative center—is an ideal system to investigate how different sensory channels converge in higher order brain centers. The neurons connecting the mushroom body to the olfactory system have been described in great detail, but input from other sensory systems remains poorly defined. Here, we use a range of anatomical and genetic techniques to identify two types of input neuron that connect visual processing centers—the lobula and the posterior lateral protocerebrum—to the dorsal accessory calyx of the mushroom body. Together with previous work that described a pathway conveying visual information from the medulla to the ventral accessory calyx of the mushroom body, our study defines a second, parallel pathway that is anatomically poised to convey information from the visual system to the dorsal accessory calyx.

Abstract: Summary
Specific forms of fatty acids are well known to have beneficial health effects, but their precise mechanism of action remains elusive. Phosphatidic acid (PA) produced by phospholipase D1 (PLD1) regulates the sequential stages underlying secretory granule exocytosis in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells, as revealed by pharmacological approaches and genetic mouse models. Lipidomic analysis shows that secretory granule and plasma membranes display distinct and specific composition in PA. Secretagogue-evoked stimulation triggers the selective production of several PA species at the plasma membrane near the sites of active exocytosis. Rescue experiments in cells depleted of PLD1 activity reveal that mono-unsaturated PA restores the number of exocytotic events, possibly by contributing to granule docking, whereas poly-unsaturated PA regulates fusion pore stability and expansion. Altogether, this work provides insight into the roles that subspecies of the same phospholipid may play based on their fatty acyl chain composition.

Abstract: Summary
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) limits the success of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) mediates the intrinsic lipolysis of cells to generate free fatty acids (FFAs), which play an essential role in the development, proliferation, and function of T cells. Here, we find that LAL is essential for donor T cells to induce GVHD in murine models of allo-HCT. Specifically, LAL is required for donor T cell survival, differentiation, and alloreactivity in GVHD target organs, but not in lymphoid organs. LAL induces the differentiation of donor T cells toward GVHD pathogenic Th1/Tc1 and Th17 while suppressing regulatory T cell generation. LAL−/− T cells succumb to oxidative stress and become anergic in target organs. Pharmacologically targeting LAL effectively prevents GVHD development while preserving the GVL activity. Thus, the present study reveals the role of LAL in T cell alloresponse and pathogenicity and validates LAL as a target for controlling GVHD and tumor relapse after allo-HCT.

Abstract: Summary
A hallmark of chronic infections is the presence of exhausted CD8 T cells, characterized by a distinct transcriptional program compared with functional effector or memory cells, co-expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, and impaired effector function, mainly driven by recurrent T cell receptor engagement. In the context of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, most studies focused on studying splenic virus-specific CD8 T cells. Here, we provide a detailed characterization of exhausted CD8 T cells isolated from six different tissues during established LCMV infection, using single-cell RNA sequencing. Our data reveal that exhausted cells are heterogeneous, adopt organ-specific transcriptomic profiles, and can be divided into five main functional subpopulations: advanced exhaustion, effector-like, intermediate, proliferating, or memory-like. Adoptive transfer experiments showed that these phenotypes are plastic, suggesting that the tissue microenvironment has a major impact in shaping the phenotype and function of virus-specific CD8 T cells during chronic infection.

Abstract: Summary
Anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a well-characterized E3 ligase that couples with UBE2C and UBE2S E2s for substrate ubiquitylation by the K11 linkage. Our recent data show that SAG/RBX2/ROC2, a RING component of Cullin-RING E3 ligase, also complexes with these E2s for K11-linked substrate polyubiquitylation. Whether these two E3s cross-talk with each other was previously unknown. Here, we report that SAG competes with APC2 for UBE2C/UBE2S binding to act as a potential endogenous inhibitor of APC/C, thereby regulating the G2-to-M progression. As such, SAG knockdown triggers premature activation of APC/C, leading to mitotic slippage and resistance to anti-microtubule drugs. On the other hand, SAG itself is a substrate of APC/CCDH1 for targeted degradation at the G1 phase. The degradation-resistant mutant of SAG-R98A/L101A accelerates the G1-to-S progression. Our study reveals that the negative cross-talk between SAG and APC/C is likely a mechanism to ensure the fidelity of cell cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
To study contributions of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons of the developing visual system, we microinject antisense Morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) against GluN1 into one cell of two-cell-stage Xenopus laevis embryos. The resulting bilateral segregation of MO induces postsynaptic NMDAR (postNMDAR) knockdown in tectal neurons on one side and presynaptic NMDAR (preNMDAR) knockdown in ganglion cells projecting to the other side. PostNMDAR knockdown reduces evoked NMDAR- and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated retinotectal currents. Although the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events is increased, the probability of evoked release is reduced. PreNMDAR knockdown results in larger evoked and unitary synaptic responses. Structurally, postNMDAR and preNMDAR knockdown produce complementary effects. Axonal arbor complexity is reduced by preNMDAR-MO and increased by postNMDAR-MO, whereas tectal dendritic arbors exhibit the inverse. The current study illustrates distinct roles for pre- and postNMDARs in circuit development and reveals extensive transsynaptic regulation of form and function.

Abstract: CAPN3 is a muscle-specific and an intrinsically disordered protein. Thus, as a scaffolding protein CAPN3 could play a role during early stages of myogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we studied the distribution and function of CAPN3 during myogenesis using embryonic chick muscle cells grown in vitro. Super-resolution microscopy showed CAPN3 distribution in (i) amorphous patches in myoblasts, (ii) a region near the nuclei of myotubes; (iii) adhesion plaques in myotubes, (iv) stress fiber-like structures in myotubes, and (v) filaments in fibroblasts. Downregulation of CAPN3 induced a decrease in the number of muscle cells and in the size of myotubes formed. These data show a diverse intracellular distribution of CAPN3, compatible with a scaffolding protein, and suggest a multitude of different interactions of CAPN3 with other partners during muscle formation.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosome function is essential for cellular homeostasis, but quality-control mechanisms that maintain healthy lysosomes remain poorly characterized. Here, we developed a method to measure lysosome turnover and use this to identify a selective mechanism of membrane degradation that involves lipidation of the autophagy protein LC3 onto lysosomal membranes and the formation of intraluminal vesicles through microautophagy. This mechanism is induced in response to metabolic stress resulting from glucose starvation or by treatment with pharmacological agents that induce osmotic stress on lysosomes. Cells lacking ATG5, an essential component of the LC3 lipidation machinery, show reduced ability to regulate lysosome size and degradative capacity in response to activation of this mechanism. These findings identify a selective mechanism of lysosome membrane turnover that is induced by stress and uncover a function for LC3 lipidation in regulating lysosome size and activity through microautophagy.

Abstract: Summary
The dysregulation of the metabolic regulator TOR complex I (TORC1) contributes to a wide array of human pathologies. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a potent inhibitor of TORC1. Here, we demonstrate that the Rag GTPase acts in both the amino-acid-sensing and growth factor signaling pathways to control TORC1 activity through the regulation of TSC dynamics in HeLa cells and Drosophila. We find that TSC lysosomal-cytosolic exchange increases in response to both amino acid and growth factor restriction. Moreover, the rate of exchange mirrors TSC function, with depletions of the Rag GTPase blocking TSC lysosomal mobility and rescuing TORC1 activity. Finally, we show that the GATOR2 complex controls the phosphorylation of TSC2, which is essential for TSC exchange. Our data support the model that the amino acid and growth factor signaling pathways converge on the Rag GTPase to inhibit TORC1 activity through the regulation of TSC dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Although ADP-ribosylation of histones by PARP-1 has been linked to genotoxic stress responses, its role in physiological processes and gene expression has remained elusive. We found that NAD+-dependent ADP-ribosylation of histone H2B-Glu35 by small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)-activated PARP-1 inhibits AMP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of adjacent H2B-Ser36, which is required for the proadipogenic gene expression program. The activity of PARP-1 on H2B requires NMNAT-1, a nuclear NAD+ synthase, which directs PARP-1 catalytic activity to Glu and Asp residues. ADP-ribosylation of Glu35 and the subsequent reduction of H2B-Ser36 phosphorylation inhibits the differentiation of adipocyte precursors in cultured cells. Parp1 knockout in preadipocytes in a mouse lineage-tracing genetic model increases adipogenesis, leading to obesity. Collectively, our results demonstrate a functional interplay between H2B-Glu35 ADP-ribosylation and H2B-Ser36 phosphorylation that controls adipogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancers are essential drivers of cell states, yet the relationship between accessibility, regulatory activity, and in vivo lineage commitment during embryogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we measure chromatin accessibility in isolated neural and mesodermal lineages across a time course of Drosophila embryogenesis. Promoters, including tissue-specific genes, are often constitutively open, even in contexts where the gene is not expressed. In contrast, the majority of distal elements have dynamic, tissue-specific accessibility. Enhancer priming appears rarely within a lineage, perhaps reflecting the speed of Drosophila embryogenesis. However, many tissue-specific enhancers are accessible in other lineages early on and become progressively closed as embryogenesis proceeds. We demonstrate the usefulness of this tissue- and time-resolved resource to definitively identify single-cell clusters, to uncover predictive motifs, and to identify many regulators of tissue development. For one such predicted neural regulator, l(3)neo38, we generate a loss-of-function mutant and uncover an essential role for neuromuscular junction and brain development.

Abstract: Summary
Hematophagous vectors lacerate host skin and capillaries to acquire a blood meal, resulting in leakage of red blood cells (RBCs) and inflammation. Here, we show that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a pleiotropic cytoprotective isoenzyme that mitigates heme-mediated tissue damage, is induced after bites of sand flies, mosquitoes, and ticks. Further, we demonstrate that erythrophagocytosis by macrophages, including a skin-residing CD163+CD91+ professional iron-recycling subpopulation, produces HO-1 after bites. Importantly, we establish that global deletion or transient inhibition of HO-1 in mice increases inflammation and pathology following Leishmania-infected sand fly bites without affecting parasite number, whereas CO, an end product of the HO-1 enzymatic reaction, suppresses skin inflammation. This indicates that HO-1 induction by blood-feeding sand flies promotes tolerance to Leishmania infection. Collectively, our data demonstrate that HO-1 induction through erythrophagocytosis is a universal mechanism that regulates skin inflammation following blood feeding by arthropods, thus promoting early-stage disease tolerance to vector-borne pathogens.

Abstract: Despite the emerging concerns about the hepatotoxic risks associated with Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), yet, the morphological and molecular alterations associated with these extensively-used nanoparticles remain to be elucidated. Thus, the current study has been designed to analyze the effect of ZnO NPs on the hepatic histopathological and immunohistochemical changes, along with the modulation of the oxidative-stress induced JNK/p38MAPK and the STAT-3 signalling. The study also explored the potential protective role of selenium against those alterations. ZnO NPs disrupted the hepatic architecture, elevated the serum liver enzyme alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and caused dose-dependent decrease in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione-peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase along with an increase in the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde. ZnO NPs also increased the area of immune-reactivity of the apoptotic protein bax and decreased the area of immune-reactivity of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl2 together with augmentation of the hepatic caspase 3 gene expression. The role of selenium in ameliorating the hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress injury, and apoptosis induced by ZnO-NPs, along with its role in modulating the JNK/p38MAPK and the STAT-3 signalling and improving the histopathological hepatic changes, offers selenium as a promising adjunctive therapy in individuals subjected to high concentrations of ZnO NPs especially in cases of extensive occupational, medicinal and industrial exposure.

Abstract: The ultrastructural characteristics of the mature spermatozoon of Holorchis pycnoporus (Digenea, Lepocreadioidea, Aephnidiogenidae) are described by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Live worms were collected from the digestive tract of the Striped seabream Lithognathus mormyrus (Teleostei, Sparidae), off the Gulf of Gabès at La Chebba (Tunisia). The ultrastructural study reveals that the male gamete of H. pycnoporus is a filiform cell tapered at both extremities and exhibiting the type III of the digenean spermatozoon proposed by Bakhoum et al. (2017a), characterized by the presence of (1) two axonemes with the 9 + ‘1’ pattern of the Trepaxonemata, (2) external ornamentation of the plasma membrane located in a posterior part of the anterior region of the spermatozoon and associated with cortical microtubules, (3) two bundles of parallel cortical microtubules with maximum number located in the middle part of the spermatozoon, and (4) generally two mitochondria. Moreover, H. pycnoporus shares a set of ultrastructural characteristics with the studied Aephnidiogenidae such as: (1) two 9+'1' axonemes of different lengths, (2) an anterior electron-dense material, (3) mitochondrion/a, (4) an external ornamentation of the plasma membrane associated with cortical microtubules, and (5) two bundles of parallel cortical microtubules with their maximum number (around 24 microtubules) located in the middle or posterior part of the spermatozoon. In the Aephnidiogenidae, the mature spermatozoon exhibits a similar ultrastructural pattern. Some differences are observed, particularly the location of maximum number of cortical microtubules and the number of mitochondria. The presence of the anterolateral electron-dense material is the major particularity in species belonging to the Lepocreadioidea. This anterior dense material could be a synapomorphy for the superfamily and an ultrastructural argument supporting the monophyletic status of the Lepocreadioidea (Bray and Cribb, 2012).

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated metabolism is a key driver of maladaptive tumor-reactive T lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment. Actionable targets that rescue the effector activity of antitumor T cells remain elusive. Here, we report that the Sirtuin-2 (Sirt2) NAD+-dependent deacetylase inhibits T cell metabolism and impairs T cell effector functions. Remarkably, upregulation of Sirt2 in human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) negatively correlates with response to TIL therapy in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Mechanistically, Sirt2 suppresses T cell metabolism by targeting key enzymes involved in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid-cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and glutaminolysis. Accordingly, Sirt2-deficient murine T cells exhibit increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in enhanced proliferation and effector functions and subsequently exhibiting superior antitumor activity. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of Sirt2 endows human TILs with these superior metabolic fitness and effector functions. Our findings unveil Sirt2 as an unexpected actionable target for reprogramming T cell metabolism to augment a broad spectrum of cancer immunotherapies.

Chang has anti-rheumatism activity, and a mass spectrometry assay of patients’ serum after administration of the herb revealed that notopterol is the most abundant component enriched. However, the functions of notopterol and its molecular target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment remain unknown. Here, we show in different RA mouse strains that both oral and intraperitoneal administration of notopterol result in significant therapeutic effects. Mechanistically, notopterol directly binds Janus kinase (JAK)2 and JAK3 kinase domains to inhibit JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) activation, leading to reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Critically, combination therapy using both notopterol and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker results in enhanced therapeutic effects compared to using TNF blocker alone. We demonstrate that notopterol ameliorates RA pathology by targeting JAK-STAT signaling, raising the possibility that notopterol could be effective in treating other diseases characterized by aberrant JAK-STAT signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Genome editing often takes the form of either error-prone sequence disruption by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or sequence replacement by homology-directed repair (HDR). Although NHEJ is generally effective, HDR is often difficult in primary cells. Here, we use a combination of immunophenotyping, next-generation sequencing, and single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate and reprogram genome editing outcomes in subpopulations of adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We find that although quiescent stem-enriched cells mostly use NHEJ, non-quiescent cells with the same immunophenotype use both NHEJ and HDR. Inducing quiescence before editing results in a loss of HDR in all cell subtypes. We develop a strategy of controlled cycling and quiescence that yields a 6-fold increase in the HDR/NHEJ ratio in quiescent stem cells ex vivo and in vivo. Our results highlight the tension between editing and cellular physiology and suggest strategies to manipulate quiescent cells for research and therapeutic genome editing.

Abstract: In plants, both hyperosmolality and salt stress induce cytosolic calcium increases within seconds, referred to as the hyperosmolality-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases, OICIcyt, and salt stress-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases, SICIcyt. Previous studies have shown that Arabidopsis reduced hyperosmolality-induced [Ca2+]i increase 1 (OSCA1.1) encodes a hyperosmolality-gated calcium-permeable channel that mediates OICIcyt in guard cells and root cells. Multiple OSCA members exist in plants; for example, Oryza sativa has 11 OsOSCAs genes, indicating that OSCAs have diverse biological functions. Here, except for OsOSCA4.1, ten full-length OsOSCAs were separately subcloned, in which OsOSCA1.4 was exclusively localised to the plasma membrane and other nine OsOSCAs-eYFP co-localised with an endoplasmic reticulum marker in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. OsOSCA1.4 was further identified as a calcium-permeable ion channel that activates an inward current after receiving an osmotic signal exerted by hyperosmolality or salt stress, and mediates OICIcyt and SICIcyt in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Moreover, overexpression of OsOSCA1.4 in Arabidopsis osca1 mutant complemented osmotic Ca2+ signalling, root growth, and stomatal movement in response to hyperosmolality and salt stress. These results will facilitate further study of OsOSCA-mediated calcium signalling and its distinct roles in rice growth and development.

Abstract: Summary
Axons in the mature central nervous system (CNS) fail to regenerate after axotomy, partly due to the inhibitory environment constituted by reactive glial cells producing astrocytic scars, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, and myelin debris. We investigated this inhibitory milieu, showing that it is reversible and depends on glial metabolic status. We show that glia can be reprogrammed to promote morphological and functional regeneration after CNS injury in Drosophila via increased glycolysis. This enhancement is mediated by the glia derived metabolites: L-lactate and L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG). Genetically/pharmacologically increasing or reducing their bioactivity promoted or impeded CNS axon regeneration. L-lactate and L-2HG from glia acted on neuronal metabotropic GABAB receptors to boost cAMP signaling. Local application of L-lactate to injured spinal cord promoted corticospinal tract axon regeneration, leading to behavioral recovery in adult mice. Our findings revealed a metabolic switch to circumvent the inhibition of glia while amplifying their beneficial effects for treating CNS injuries.

Abstract: Summary
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and is characterized by the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Recent studies have implicated pro-inflammatory microglia, macrophages, and A1 astrocytes in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The role of pro-inflammatory, neurotoxic A1 astrocytes in glaucoma is just beginning to be explored. Using a mouse model of glaucoma, we demonstrate that ocular hypertension is sufficient to trigger production of C1q, interleukin-1α (IL-1α), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), three cytokines necessary and sufficient to drive the formation of A1 astrocytes. Upregulation of these cytokines occurs first in CD11b+ CD11c+ cells followed by CD11b+ CD11c− cells. Ablation of this pathway, by either genetic deletions of C1qa, IL-1α, and TNF-α, or treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist NLY01, reduces A1 astrocyte transformation and RGC death. Together, these results highlight a neuroinflammatory mechanism of glaucomatous neurodegeneration that can be therapeutically targeted by NLY01 administration.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNA predicting cardiac remodeling (lnc LIPCAR) was implicated in several human diseases, while its role in atrial fibrillation (AF) remained poorly understood. Our study aimed to discover the role of LICPAR played in AF. Samples of atrial muscle tissues from patients diagnosed with sinus rhythm (SR) and atrial fibrillation (AF) were collected, and human atrial fibroblasts were isolated and identified under immunofluorescence staining. After Angiotensin II (Ang II, as a activator of TGF-β) stimulation with LICPAR overexpression or knockdown, the viability and proliferation of atrial fibroblasts were respectively determined using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and clone formation assay. Relative expressions of LICPAR, fibrosis- and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad2/3-pathway related proteins were measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot as needed. LICPAR and TGF-β1 were upregulated and were positively correlated in atrial muscle tissues from AF. Atrial fibroblasts were identified as Vimentin positive. Further analysis indicated that Ang II enhanced the levels of LIPCAR, Smad2/3 phosphorylation and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Also, upregulating LIPCAR further promoted the promotive effects of Ang II on levels of LIPCAR, Collagen I, Collagen II, α-SMA and Smad2/3 phosphorylation, cell viability and proliferation of atrial fibroblasts, whereas silencing LIPCAR resulted in opposite effects. LICPAR regulates atrial fibrosis via modulating TGF-β/Smad pathway, which provided a potential therapeutic method for AF in clinical practice in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Animal fetuses may be used for the regeneration of human organs. We have previously generated a transgenic mouse model that allows diphtheria toxin (DT)-induced ablation of Six2-positive nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). Elimination of existing native host NPCs enables their replacement with donor NPCs, which can generate neo-nephrons. However, this system cannot be applied to human NPCs, because DT induces apoptosis in human cells. Therefore, the present study presents a transgenic mouse model for the ablation of NPCs using tamoxifen, which does not affect human cells. Using this system, we successfully regenerate interspecies neo-nephrons, which exhibit urine-producing abilities, from transplanted rat NPCs in a mouse host. Transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NPCs results in differentiation into renal vesicles, which connect to the ureteric bud of the host. Thus, we demonstrate the possibility of the regeneration of human kidneys derived from human iPSC-derived NPCs via NPC replacement.

Abstract: Summary
The linkage, length, and architecture of ubiquitin (Ub) chains are all important variables in providing tight control over many biological paradigms. There are clear roles for branched architectures in regulating proteasome-mediated degradation, but the proteins that selectively recognize and process these atypical chains are unknown. Here, using synthetic and enzyme-derived ubiquitin chains along with intact mass spectrometry, we report that UCH37/UCHL5, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinase, cleaves K48 branched chains. The activity and selectivity toward branched chains is markedly enhanced by the proteasomal Ub receptor RPN13/ADRM1. Using reconstituted proteasome complexes, we find that chain debranching promotes degradation of substrates modified with branched chains under multi-turnover conditions. These results are further supported by proteome-wide pulse-chase experiments, which show that the loss of UCH37 activity impairs global protein turnover. Our work therefore defines UCH37 as a debranching deubiquitinase important for promoting proteasomal degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Developing strategies that promote the resolution of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis remains a major therapeutic challenge. Here, we show that exosomes produced by naive bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM-exo) contain anti-inflammatory microRNA-99a/146b/378a that are further increased in exosomes produced by BMDM polarized with IL-4 (BMDM-IL-4-exo). These exosomal microRNAs suppress inflammation by targeting NF-κB and TNF-α signaling and foster M2 polarization in recipient macrophages. Repeated infusions of BMDM-IL-4-exo into Apoe−/− mice fed a Western diet reduce excessive hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and thereby the number of myeloid cells in the circulation and macrophages in aortic root lesions. This also leads to a reduction in necrotic lesion areas that collectively stabilize atheroma. Thus, BMDM-IL-4-exo may represent a useful therapeutic approach for atherosclerosis and other inflammatory disorders by targeting NF-κB and TNF-α via microRNA cargo delivery.

Abstract: Summary
Long-lived rodents have become an attractive model for the studies on aging. To understand evolutionary paths to long life, we prepare chromosome-level genome assemblies of the two longest-lived rodents, Canadian beaver (Castor canadensis) and naked mole rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber), which were scaffolded with in vitro proximity ligation and chromosome conformation capture data and complemented with long-read sequencing. Our comparative genomic analyses reveal that amino acid substitutions at “disease-causing” sites are widespread in the rodent genomes and that identical substitutions in long-lived rodents are associated with common adaptive phenotypes, e.g., enhanced resistance to DNA damage and cellular stress. By employing a newly developed substitution model and likelihood ratio test, we find that energy and fatty acid metabolism pathways are enriched for signals of positive selection in both long-lived rodents. Thus, the high-quality genome resource of long-lived rodents can assist in the discovery of genetic factors that control longevity and adaptive evolution.

Abstract: Summary
JQ1 is a BET-bromodomain inhibitor that has immunomodulatory effects. However, the precise molecular mechanism that JQ1 targets to elicit changes in antibody production is not understood. Our results show that JQ1 induces apoptosis, reduces cell proliferation, and as a consequence, inhibits antibody-secreting cell differentiation. ChIP-sequencing reveals a selective displacement of Brd4 in response to acute JQ1 treatment (<2 h), resulting in specific transcriptional repression. After 8 h, subsequent alterations in gene expression arise as a result of the global loss of Brd4 occupancy. We demonstrate that apoptosis induced by JQ1 is solely attributed to the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (Bcl2l11). Conversely, cell-cycle regulation by JQ1 is associated with multiple Myc-associated gene targets. Our results demonstrate that JQ1 drives temporal changes in Brd4 displacement that results in a specific transcriptional profile that directly affects B cell survival and proliferation to modulate the humoral immune response.

Abstract: Summary
Sensing stressful conditions and adjusting the cellular metabolism to adapt to the environment are essential activities for bacteria to survive in variable situations. Here, we describe a stress-related protein, YdiU, and characterize YdiU as an enzyme that catalyzes the covalent attachment of uridine-5′-monophosphate to a protein tyrosine/histidine residue, an unusual modification defined as UMPylation. Mn2+ serves as an essential co-factor for YdiU-mediated UMPylation. UTP and Mn2+ binding converts YdiU to an aggregate-prone state facilitating the recruitment of chaperones. The UMPylation of chaperones prevents them from binding co-factors or clients, thereby impairing their function. Consistent with the recent finding that YdiU acts as an AMPylator, we further demonstrate that the self-AMPylation of YdiU padlocks its chaperone-UMPylation activity. A detailed mechanism is proposed based on the crystal structures of Apo-YdiU and YdiU-AMPNPP-Mn2+ and on molecular dynamics simulation models of YdiU-UTP-Mn2+ and YdiU-UTP-peptide. In vivo data demonstrate that YdiU effectively protects Salmonella from stress-induced ATP depletion through UMPylation.

Abstract: Summary
Stress granules (SGs) are condensates of mRNPs that form in response to stress. SGs arise by multivalent protein-protein, protein-RNA, and RNA-RNA interactions. However, the role of RNA-RNA interactions in SG assembly remains understudied. Here, we describe a yeast SG reconstitution system that faithfully recapitulates SG assembly in response to trigger RNAs. SGs assembled by stem-loop RNA triggers are ATP-sensitive, regulated by helicase/chaperone activity, and exhibit the hallmarks of maturation observed for SG proteins that phase-separate in vitro. Additionally, the fraction of total RNA that phase-separates in vitro is sufficient to trigger SG formation. However, condensation of NFT1 mRNA, an enriched transcript in this population, can only assemble an incomplete SG. These results suggest that networks of distinct transcripts are required to form a canonical SG and provide a platform for dissecting the interplay between the transcriptome and ATP-dependent remodeling in SG formation.

Abstract: Summary
Cholesterol plays two critical roles in Hedgehog signaling, a fundamental pathway in animal development and cancer: it covalently modifies the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) ligand, restricting its release from producing cells, and directly activates Smoothened in responding cells. In both contexts, a membrane protein related to bacterial RND transporters regulates cholesterol: Dispatched1 controls release of cholesterylated SHH, and Patched1 antagonizes Smoothened activation by cholesterol. The mechanism and driving force for eukaryotic RND proteins, including Dispatched1 and Patched1, are unknown. Here, we show that Dispatched1 acts enzymatically to catalyze SHH release. Dispatched1 uses the energy of the plasma membrane Na+ gradient, thus functioning as an SHH/Na+ antiporter. In contrast, Patched1 repression of Smoothened requires the opposing K+ gradient. Our results clarify the transporter activity of essential eukaryotic RND proteins and demonstrate that the two main cation gradients of animal cells differentially power cholesterol transport at two crucial steps in the Hedgehog pathway.

Abstract: Summary
During embryogenesis, lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells are essential for lymph node organogenesis. These cells are part of the innate lymphoid cell (ILC) family. Although their earliest embryonic hematopoietic origin is unclear, other innate immune cells have been shown to be derived from early hemogenic endothelium in the yolk sac as well as the aorta-gonad-mesonephros. A proper model to discriminate between these locations was unavailable. In this study, using a Cxcr4-CreERT2 lineage tracing model, we identify a major contribution from embryonic hemogenic endothelium, but not the yolk sac, toward LTi progenitors. Conversely, embryonic LTi cells are replaced by hematopoietic stem cell-derived cells in adults. We further show that, in the fetal liver, common lymphoid progenitors differentiate into highly dynamic alpha-lymphoid precursor cells that, at this embryonic stage, preferentially mature into LTi precursors and establish their functional LTi cell identity only after reaching the periphery.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous mammalian cells contain abundant Zn2+ in their secretory granules, yet available Zn2+ sensors lack the desired specificity and sensitivity for imaging granular Zn2+. We developed a fluorescent zinc granule indicator, ZIGIR, that possesses numerous desired properties for live cell imaging, including >100-fold fluorescence enhancement, membrane permeability, and selective enrichment to acidic granules. The combined advantages endow ZIGIR with superior sensitivity and specificity for imaging granular Zn2+. ZIGIR enables separation of heterogenous β cells based on their insulin content and sorting of mouse islets into pure α cells and β cells. In human islets, ZIGIR facilitates sorting of endocrine cells into highly enriched α cells and β cells, reveals unexpectedly high Zn2+ activity in the somatostatin granule of some δ cells, and uncovers variation in the glucagon content among human α cells. We expect broad applications of ZIGIR for studying Zn2+ biology and Zn2+-rich secretory granules and for engineering β cells with high insulin content for treating diabetes.

SGs act as a protective mechanism to cope with acute stress, but persistent SGs have cytotoxic effects that are associated with several age-related diseases. Here, we demonstrate that the testis-specific protein, MAGE-B2, increases cellular stress tolerance by suppressing SG formation through translational inhibition of the key SG nucleator G3BP. MAGE-B2 reduces G3BP protein levels below the critical concentration for phase separation and suppresses SG initiation. Knockout of the MAGE-B2 mouse ortholog or overexpression of G3BP1 confers hypersensitivity of the male germline to heat stress in vivo. Thus, MAGE-B2 provides cytoprotection to maintain mammalian spermatogenesis, a highly thermosensitive process that must be preserved throughout reproductive life. These results demonstrate a mechanism that allows for tissue-specific resistance against stress and could aid in the development of male fertility therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Granule cells (GCs) of the cerebellar input layer express high-affinity δ GABAA subunit-containing GABAA receptors (δGABAARs) that respond to ambient GABA levels and context-dependent neuromodulators like steroids. We find that GC-specific deletion of δGABAA (cerebellar [cb] δ knockout [KO]) decreases tonic inhibition, makes GCs hyperexcitable, and in turn, leads to differential activation of cb output regions as well as many cortical and subcortical brain areas involved in cognition, anxiety-like behaviors, and the stress response. Cb δ KO mice display deficits in many behaviors, but motor function is normal. Strikingly, δGABAA deletion alters maternal behavior as well as spontaneous, stress-related, and social behaviors specifically in females. Our findings establish that δGABAARs enable the cerebellum to control diverse behaviors not previously associated with the cerebellum in a sex-dependent manner. These insights may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie behavioral abnormalities in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders that display a gender bias.

Abstract: Summary
Plastid-nucleus genome coordination is crucial for plastid activity, but the mechanisms remain unclear. By treating Arabidopsis plants with the organellar genome-damaging agent ciprofloxacin, we found that plastid genome instability can alter endoreplication and the cell cycle. Similar results are observed in the plastid genome instability mutants of reca1why1why3. Cell division and embryo development are disturbed in the reca1why1why3 mutant. Notably, SMR5 and SMR7 genes, which encode cell-cycle kinase inhibitors, are upregulated in plastid genome instability plants, and the mutation of SMR7 can restore the endoreplication and growth phenotype of reca1why1why3 plants. Furthermore, we establish that the DNA damage response transcription factor SOG1 mediates the alteration of endoreplication and cell cycle triggered by plastid genome instability. Finally, we demonstrate that reactive oxygen species produced in plastids are important for plastid-nucleus genome coordination. Our findings uncover a molecular mechanism for the coordination of plastid and nuclear genomes during plant growth and development.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza A virus (IAV) infection stimulates a type I interferon (IFN-I) response in host cells that exerts antiviral effects by inducing the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, most ISGs are poorly studied for their roles in the infection of IAV. Herein, we demonstrate that SERTA domain containing 3 (SERTAD3) has a significant inhibitory effect on IAV replication in vitro. More importantly, Sertad3−/− mice develop more severe symptoms upon IAV infection. Mechanistically, we find SERTAD3 reduces IAV replication through interacting with viral polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), and polymerase acidic protein (PA) to disrupt the formation of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex. We further identify an 8-amino-acid peptide of SERTAD3 as a minimum interacting motif that can disrupt RdRp complex formation and inhibit IAV replication. Thus, our studies not only identify SERTAD3 as an antiviral ISG, but also provide the mechanism of potential application of SERTAD3-derived peptide in suppressing influenza replication.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane protein biogenesis faces the challenge of chaperoning hydrophobic transmembrane helices for faithful membrane insertion. The guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathway targets and inserts tail-anchored (TA) proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane with an insertase (yeast Get1/Get2 or mammalian WRB/CAML) that captures the TA from a cytoplasmic chaperone (Get3 or TRC40, respectively). Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions, native mass spectrometry, and structure-based mutagenesis of human WRB/CAML/TRC40 and yeast Get1/Get2/Get3 complexes. Get3 binding to the membrane insertase supports heterotetramer formation, and phosphatidylinositol binding at the heterotetramer interface stabilizes the insertase for efficient TA insertion in vivo. We identify a Get2/CAML cytoplasmic helix that forms a “gating” interaction with Get3/TRC40 important for TA insertion. Structural homology with YidC and the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) implicates an evolutionarily conserved insertion mechanism for divergent substrates utilizing a hydrophilic groove. Thus, we provide a detailed structural and mechanistic framework to understand TA membrane insertion.

Abstract: Summary
A certain number of epithelial cells in intestinal crypts are DNA damage resistant and contribute to regeneration. However, the cellular mechanism underlying intestinal regeneration remains unclear. Using lineage tracing, we show that cells marked by an Msi1 reporter (Msi1+) are right above Lgr5high cells in intestinal crypts and exhibit DNA damage resistance. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the Msi1+ cells are heterogeneous with the majority being intestinal stem cells (ISCs). The DNA damage-resistant subpopulation of Msi1+ cells is characterized by low-to-negative Lgr5 expression and is more rapidly cycling than Lgr5high radiosensitive crypt base columnar stem cells (CBCs). This enables an efficient repopulation of the intestinal epithelium at early stage when Lgr5high cells are not emerging. Furthermore, relative to CBCs, Msi1+ cells preferentially produce Paneth cells during homeostasis and upon radiation repair. Together, we demonstrate that the DNA damage-resistant Msi1+ cells are cycling ISCs that maintain and regenerate the intestinal epithelium.

Abstract: Summary
The Coronaviridae is a family of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA genomes in nature, coronaviruses are critically dependent on long-distance RNA-RNA interactions to regulate the viral transcription and replication pathways. Here we experimentally mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome and subgenomic mRNAs. We uncovered a network of RNA-RNA interactions spanning tens of thousands of nucleotides. These interactions reveal that the viral genome and subgenomes adopt alternative topologies inside cells and engage in different interactions with host RNAs. Notably, we discovered a long-range RNA-RNA interaction, the FSE-arch, that encircles the programmed ribosomal frameshifting element. The FSE-arch is conserved in the related MERS-CoV and is under purifying selection. Our findings illuminate RNA structure-based mechanisms governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses and will aid future efforts to develop antiviral strategies.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted that early enhancement of the glycolytic pathway is a mode of maintaining the pro-inflammatory status of immune cells. Thiamine, a well-known co-activator of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, a gatekeeping enzyme, shifts energy utilization of glucose from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, we hypothesized that thiamine may modulate inflammation by alleviating metabolic shifts during immune cell activation. First, using allithiamine, which showed the most potent anti-inflammatory capacity among thiamine derivatives, we confirmed the inhibitory effects of allithiamine on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and maturation process in dendritic cells. We applied the LPS-induced sepsis model to examine whether allithiamine has a protective role in hyper-inflammatory status. We observed that allithiamine attenuated tissue damage and organ dysfunction during endotoxemia, even when the treatment was given after the early cytokine release. We assessed the changes in glucose metabolites during LPS-induced dendritic cell activation and found that allithiamine significantly inhibited glucose-driven citrate accumulation. We then examined the clinical implication of regulating metabolites during sepsis by performing a tail bleeding assay upon allithiamine treatment, which expands its capacity to hamper the coagulation process. Finally, we confirmed that the role of allithiamine in metabolic regulation is critical in exerting anti-inflammatory action by demonstrating its inhibitory effect upon mitochondrial citrate transporter activity. In conclusion, thiamine could be used as an alternative approach for controlling the immune response in patients with sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the pioneer transcription factor FOXA1 are a hallmark of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers. Examining FOXA1 in ∼5,000 breast cancer patients identifies several hotspot mutations in the Wing2 region and a breast cancer-specific mutation SY242CS, located in the third β strand. Using a clinico-genomically curated cohort, together with breast cancer models, we find that FOXA1 mutations associate with a lower response to aromatase inhibitors. Mechanistically, Wing2 mutations display increased chromatin binding at ER loci upon estrogen stimulation, and an enhanced ER-mediated transcription without changes in chromatin accessibility. In contrast, SY242CS shows neomorphic properties that include the ability to open distinct chromatin regions and activate an alternative cistrome and transcriptome. Structural modeling predicts that SY242CS confers a conformational change that mediates stable binding to a non-canonical DNA motif. Taken together, our results provide insights into how FOXA1 mutations perturb its function to dictate cancer progression and therapeutic response.

Abstract: Summary
Translation of ribosomal protein-coding mRNAs (RP-mRNAs) constitutes a key step in ribosome biogenesis, but the mechanisms that modulate RP-mRNA translation in coordination with other cellular processes are poorly defined. Here, we show that subcellular localization of RP-mRNAs acts as a key regulator of their translation during cell migration. As cells migrate into their surroundings, RP-mRNAs localize to the actin-rich cell protrusions. This localization is mediated by La-related protein 6 (LARP6), an RNA-binding protein that is enriched in protrusions. Protrusions act as hotspots of translation for RP-mRNAs, enhancing RP synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, and the overall protein synthesis in migratory cells. In human breast carcinomas, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) upregulates LARP6 expression to enhance protein synthesis and support invasive growth. Our findings reveal LARP6-mediated mRNA localization as a key regulator of ribosome biogenesis during cell migration and demonstrate a role for this process in cancer progression downstream of EMT.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular hyperexcitability is a salient feature of fragile X syndrome animal models. The cellular basis of hyperexcitability and how it responds to changing activity states is not fully understood. Here, we show increased axon initial segment length in CA1 of the Fmr1−/y mouse hippocampus, with increased cellular excitability. This change in length does not result from reduced AIS plasticity, as prolonged depolarization induces changes in AIS length independent of genotype. However, depolarization does reduce cellular excitability, the magnitude of which is greater in Fmr1−/y neurons. Finally, we observe reduced functional inputs from the entorhinal cortex, with no genotypic difference in the firing rates of CA1 pyramidal neurons. This suggests that AIS-dependent hyperexcitability in Fmr1−/y mice may result from adaptive or homeostatic regulation induced by reduced functional synaptic connectivity. Thus, while AIS length and intrinsic excitability contribute to cellular hyperexcitability, they may reflect a homeostatic mechanism for reduced synaptic input onto CA1 neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Site-directed RNA editing approaches offer great potential to correct genetic mutations in somatic cells while avoiding permanent off-target genomic edits. Nuclease-dead RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems recruit functional effectors to RNA molecules in a programmable fashion. Here, we demonstrate a Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9-ADAR2 fusion system that uses a 3′ modified guide RNA (gRNA) to enable adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of specific bases on reporter and endogenously expressed mRNAs. Due to the sufficient nature of the 3′ gRNA extension sequence, we observe that Cas9 gRNA spacer sequences are dispensable for directed RNA editing, revealing that Cas9 can act as an RNA-aptamer-binding protein. We demonstrate that Cas9-based A-to-I editing is comparable in on-target efficiency and off-target specificity with Cas13 RNA editing versions. This study provides a systematic benchmarking of RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas designs for reversible nucleotide-level conversion at the transcriptome level.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant mitophagy has been implicated in a broad spectrum of disorders. PINK1, Parkin, and ubiquitin have pivotal roles in priming mitophagy. However, the entire regulatory landscape and the precise control mechanisms of mitophagy remain to be elucidated. Here, we uncover fundamental mitophagy regulation involving PINK1 and a non-canonical role of the mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFm). The mitochondrion-cytosol dual-localized TUFm interacts with PINK1 biochemically and genetically, which is an evolutionarily conserved Parkin-independent route toward mitophagy. A PINK1-dependent TUFm phosphoswitch at Ser222 determines conversion from activating to suppressing mitophagy. PINK1 modulates differential translocation of TUFm because p-S222-TUFm is restricted predominantly to the cytosol, where it inhibits mitophagy by impeding Atg5-Atg12 formation. The self-antagonizing feature of PINK1/TUFm is critical for the robustness of mitophagy regulation, achieved by the unique kinetic parameters of p-S222-TUFm, p-S65-ubiquitin, and their common kinase PINK1. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into mitophagy and mitophagy-associated disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is an important human pathogen associated with gastric inflammation and neoplasia. It is commonly believed that this bacterium avoids major immune recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) because of low intrinsic activity of its flagellin and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In particular, TLR5 specifically detects flagellins in various bacterial pathogens, while Hp evolved mutations in flagellin to evade detection through TLR5. Cancerogenic Hp strains encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The T4SS core component and pilus-associated protein CagY, a large VirB10 ortholog, drives effector molecule translocation. Here, we identify CagY as a flagellin-independent TLR5 agonist. We detect five TLR5 interaction sites, promoting binding of CagY-positive Hp to TLR5-expressing cells, TLR5 stimulation, and intracellular signal transduction. Consequently, CagY constitutes a remarkable VirB10 member detected by TLR5, driving crucial innate immune responses by this human pathogen.

Abstract: Summary
The mononuclear phagocyte (MP) system consists of macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs). MP subtypes play distinct functional roles in steady-state and inflammatory conditions. Although murine MPs are well characterized, their pulmonary and lymph node (LN) human homologs remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we have created a gene expression compendium across 24 distinct human and murine lung and LN MPs, along with human blood and murine spleen MPs, to serve as validation datasets. In-depth RNA sequencing identifies corresponding human-mouse MP subtypes and determines marker genes shared and divergent across species. Unexpectedly, only 13%–23% of the top 1,000 marker genes (i.e., genes not shared across species-specific MP subtypes) overlap in corresponding human-mouse MP counterparts. Lastly, CD88 in both species helps distinguish monocytes/macrophages from DCs. Our cross-species expression compendium serves as a resource for future translational studies to investigate beforehand whether pursuing specific MP subtypes or genes will prove fruitful.

Abstract: Summary
Locomotion activates an array of sensory inputs that may help build the self-position map of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). In this map, speed-coding neurons are thought to dynamically update representations of the animal’s position. A possible origin for the entorhinal speed signal is the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which is critically involved in the activation of locomotor programs. Here, we describe, in rats, a circuit connecting the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) of the MLR to the MEC via the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB). At each level of this pathway, locomotion speed is linearly encoded in neuronal firing rates. Optogenetic activation of PPN cells drives locomotion and modulates activity of speed-modulated neurons in HDB and MEC. Our results provide evidence for a pathway by which brainstem speed signals can reach cortical structures implicated in navigation and higher-order dynamic representations of space.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin D1 encodes the regulatory subunit of a holoenzyme that phosphorylates RB and functions as a collaborative nuclear oncogene. The serine threonine kinase Akt plays a pivotal role in the control of cellular metabolism, survival, and mitogenic signaling. Herein, Akt1-mediated phosphorylation of downstream substrates in the mammary gland is reduced by cyclin D1 genetic deletion and is induced by mammary-gland-targeted cyclin D1 overexpression. Cyclin D1 is associated with Akt1 and augments the rate of onset and maximal cellular Akt1 activity induced by mitogens. Cyclin D1 is identified in a cytoplasmic-membrane-associated pool, and cytoplasmic-membrane-localized cyclin D1—but not nuclear-localized cyclin D1—recapitulates Akt1 transcriptional function. These studies identify a novel extranuclear function of cyclin D1 to enhance proliferative functions via augmenting Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor evolution from a single cell into a malignant, heterogeneous tissue remains poorly understood. Here, we profile single-cell transcriptomes of genetically engineered mouse lung tumors at seven stages, from pre-neoplastic hyperplasia to adenocarcinoma. The diversity of transcriptional states increases over time and is reproducible across tumors and mice. Cancer cells progressively adopt alternate lineage identities, computationally predicted to be mediated through a common transitional, high-plasticity cell state (HPCS). Accordingly, HPCS cells prospectively isolated from mouse tumors and human patient-derived xenografts display high capacity for differentiation and proliferation. The HPCS program is associated with poor survival across human cancers and demonstrates chemoresistance in mice. Our study reveals a central principle underpinning intra-tumoral heterogeneity and motivates therapeutic targeting of the HPCS.

Abstract: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) promote tumour progression by contributing to angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and immunotherapy resistance. Although recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can promote the expansion of MDSCs in the tumour environment, the mechanisms involved in this process are largely unknown. Here, we report that microRNA 449c (miR-449c) expression was upregulated in myeloid progenitor cells upon activation of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) under tumour conditions. MiR-449c upregulation increased the generation of monocytic MDSCs (mo-MDSCs). The increased expression of miR-449c could target STAT6 mRNA in myeloid progenitor cells to shift the differentiation balance of myeloid progenitor cells and lead to an enhancement of the mo-MDSCs population in the tumour environment. Thus, our results demonstrate that the miR-449c/STAT6 axis is involved in the expansion of mo-MDSCs from myeloid progenitor cells upon activation of CXCR2, and thus, inhibition of miR-449c/STAT6 signalling may help to attenuate tumour progression.

Abstract: Summary
How cellular checkpoints couple the orderly assembly of macromolecular machines with cell-cycle progression is poorly understood. The alpha-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus assembles a single polar flagellum during each cell cycle. We discovered that the expression of multiple flagellin transcripts is licensed by a translational checkpoint responsive to a dual input signal: a secretion-competent hook-basal-body (HBB) structure and a surge in the FlaF secretion chaperone during cytokinesis, instructed by the cell-cycle program. We find that the unorthodox FljJ flagellin, one of the six flagellin paralogs, acts as a checkpoint linchpin, binding both FlaF and the FlbT translational regulator. FljJ recruits FlbT to inhibit translation at the 5′ untranslated region in other flagellin transcripts before HBB assembly. Once FlaF is synthesized and stabilized, it directs FljJ secretion through the HBB, thereby separating FlbT from its co-activator and relieving translational inhibition. The FlbT/FlaF pair is wide spread and its functional properties are conserved in alpha-proteobacteria, including pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogenesis is highly orchestrated and involves the differentiation of diploid spermatogonia into haploid sperm. The process is driven by spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). SSCs undergo mitotic self-renewal, whereas sub-populations undergo differentiation and later gain competence to initiate meiosis. Here, we describe a high-resolution single-cell RNA-seq atlas of cells derived from Cynomolgus macaque testis. We identify gene signatures that define spermatogonial populations and explore self-renewal versus differentiation dynamics. We detail transcriptional changes occurring over the entire process of spermatogenesis and highlight the concerted activity of DNA damage response (DDR) pathway genes, which have dual roles in maintaining genomic integrity and effecting meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). We show remarkable similarities and differences in gene expression during spermatogenesis with two other eutherian mammals, i.e., mouse and humans. Sex chromosome expression in the male germline in all three species demonstrates conserved features of MSCI but divergent multicopy and ampliconic gene content.

Abstract: Summary
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) serve a dual role in charging tRNAs. Their enzymatic activities both provide protein synthesis flux and reduce uncharged tRNA levels. Although uncharged tRNAs can negatively impact bacterial growth, substantial concentrations of tRNAs remain deacylated even under nutrient-rich conditions. Here, we show that tRNA charging in Bacillus subtilis is not maximized due to optimization of aaRS production during rapid growth, which prioritizes demands in protein synthesis over charging levels. The presence of uncharged tRNAs is alleviated by precisely tuned translation kinetics and the stringent response, both insensitive to aaRS overproduction but sharply responsive to underproduction, allowing for just enough aaRS production atop a “fitness cliff.” Notably, we find that the stringent response mitigates fitness defects at all aaRS underproduction levels even without external starvation. Thus, adherence to minimal, flux-satisfying protein production drives limited tRNA charging and provides a basis for the sensitivity and setpoints of an integrated growth-control network.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication is carried out by a multi-protein machine called the replisome. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the replisome is composed of over 30 different proteins arranged into multiple subassemblies, each performing distinct activities. Synchrony of these activities is required for efficient replication and preservation of genomic integrity. How this is achieved is particularly puzzling at the lagging strand, where current models of the replisome architecture propose turnover of the canonical lagging strand polymerase, Pol δ, at every cycle of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Here, we established single-molecule fluorescence microscopy protocols to study the binding kinetics of individual replisome subunits in live S. cerevisiae. Our results show long residence times for most subunits at the active replisome, supporting a model where all subassemblies bind tightly and work in a coordinated manner for extended periods, including Pol δ, redefining the architecture of the active eukaryotic replisome.

Abstract: Summary
While effective anti-cancer drugs targeting the CHK1 kinase are advancing in the clinic, drug resistance is rapidly emerging. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR-mediated knockout of the little-known gene FAM122A/PABIR1 confers cellular resistance to CHK1 inhibitors (CHK1is) and cross-resistance to ATR inhibitors. Knockout of FAM122A results in activation of PP2A-B55α, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the WEE1 protein and rescues WEE1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The resulting increase in WEE1 protein expression reduces replication stress, activates the G2/M checkpoint, and confers cellular resistance to CHK1is. Interestingly, in tumor cells with oncogene-driven replication stress, CHK1 can directly phosphorylate FAM122A, leading to activation of the PP2A-B55α phosphatase and increased WEE1 expression. A combination of a CHK1i plus a WEE1 inhibitor can overcome CHK1i resistance of these tumor cells, thereby enhancing anti-cancer activity. The FAM122A expression level in a tumor cell can serve as a useful biomarker for predicting CHK1i sensitivity or resistance.

Abstract: Summary
SETD1A encodes a histone methyltransferase whose de novo mutations are identified in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and confer a large increase in disease risk. Here, we generate Setd1a mutant mice carrying the frameshift mutation that closely mimics a loss-of-function variant of SCZ. Our Setd1a (+/−) mice display various behavioral abnormalities relevant to features of SCZ, impaired excitatory synaptic transmission in layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and altered expression of diverse genes related to neurodevelopmental disorders and synaptic functions in the mPFC. RNAi-mediated Setd1a knockdown (KD) specifically in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mPFC only recapitulates impaired sociality among multiple behavioral abnormalities of Setd1a (+/−) mice. Optogenetics-assisted selective stimulation of presynaptic neurons combined with Setd1a KD reveals that Setd1a at postsynaptic site is essential for excitatory synaptic transmission. Our findings suggest that reduced SETD1A may attenuate excitatory synaptic function and contribute to the pathophysiology of SCZ.

Abstract: Summary
Cohesin mediates sister chromatid cohesion and 3D genome folding. Two versions of the complex carrying STAG1 or STAG2 coexist in somatic vertebrate cells. STAG2 is commonly mutated in cancer, and germline mutations have been identified in cohesinopathy patients. To better understand the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, we report the consequences of Stag2 ablation in mice. STAG2 is largely dispensable in adults, and its tissue-wide inactivation does not lead to tumors but reduces fitness and affects both hematopoiesis and intestinal homeostasis. STAG2 is also dispensable for murine embryonic fibroblasts in vitro. In contrast, Stag2-null embryos die by mid-gestation and show global developmental delay and defective heart morphogenesis, most prominently in structures derived from secondary heart field progenitors. Both decreased proliferation and altered transcription of tissue-specific genes contribute to these defects. Our results provide compelling evidence on cell- and tissue-specific roles of different cohesin complexes and how their dysfunction contributes to disease.

Abstract: Summary
SGLT2 inhibitors offer strong renoprotection in subjects with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). But the mechanism for such protection is not clear. Here, we report that in damaged proximal tubules of high-fat diet-fed ApoE-knockout mice, a model of non-proteinuric DKD, ATP production shifted from lipolysis to ketolysis dependent due to hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We further found that empagliflozin raised endogenous ketone body (KB) levels, and thus its use or treatment with 1,3-butanediol, a KB precursor, prevented decreases in renal ATP levels and organ damage in the mice. The renoprotective effect of empagliflozin was abolished by gene deletion of Hmgcs2, a rate-limiting enzyme of ketogenesis. Furthermore, KBs attenuated mTORC1-associated podocyte damage and proteinuria in diabetic db/db mice. Our findings show that SGLT2 inhibition-associated renoprotection is mediated by an elevation of KBs that in turn corrects mTORC1 hyperactivation that occurs in non-proteinuric and proteinuric DKD.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that continuously grow, divide, and fuse. The division of mitochondria is crucial for human health. During mitochondrial division, the mechano-guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) dynamin-related protein (Drp1) severs mitochondria at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria contact sites, where peripheral ER tubules interact with mitochondria. Here, we report that Drp1 directly shapes peripheral ER tubules in human and mouse cells. This ER-shaping activity is independent of GTP hydrolysis and located in a highly conserved peptide of 18 amino acids (termed D-octadecapeptide), which is predicted to form an amphipathic α helix. Synthetic D-octadecapeptide tubulates liposomes in vitro and the ER in cells. ER tubules formed by Drp1 promote mitochondrial division by facilitating ER-mitochondria interactions. Thus, Drp1 functions as a two-in-one protein during mitochondrial division, with ER tubulation and mechano-GTPase activities.

Abstract: Summary
Recently developed brain stimulation techniques have significantly advanced our ability to manipulate the brain’s function. However, stimulating specific neurons in a desired region without significant surgical invasion remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a neuron-specific and region-targeted neural excitation strategy using non-invasive ultrasound through activation of heterologously expressed mechanosensitive ion channels (MscL-G22S). Low-intensity ultrasound is significantly better at inducing Ca2+ influx and neuron activation in vitro and at evoking electromyogram (EMG) responses in vivo in targeted cells expressing MscL-G22S. Neurons in the cerebral cortex or dorsomedial striatum of mice are made to express MscL-G22S and stimulated ultrasonically. We find significant upregulation of c-Fos in neuron nuclei only in the regions expressing MscL-G22S compared with the non-MscL controls, as well as in various other regions in the same brain. Thus, we detail an effective approach for activating specific regions and cell types in intact mouse brains by sensitizing them to ultrasound using a mechanosensitive ion channel.

Abstract: Summary
Gut-associated phages are hypothesized to alter the abundance and activity of their bacterial hosts, contributing to human health and disease. Although temperate phages constitute a significant fraction of the gut virome, the effects of lysogenic infection are underexplored. We report that the temperate phage, Bacteroides phage BV01, broadly alters its host’s transcriptome, the prominent human gut symbiont Bacteroides vulgatus. This alteration occurs through phage-induced repression of a tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) and represses bile acid deconjugation. Because microbially modified bile acids are important signals for the mammalian host, this is a mechanism by which a phage may influence mammalian phenotypes. Furthermore, BV01 and its relatives in the proposed phage family Salyersviridae are ubiquitous in human gut metagenomes, infecting a broad range of Bacteroides hosts. These results demonstrate the complexity of phage-bacteria-mammal relationships and emphasize a need to better understand the role of temperate phages in the gut microbiome.

Abstract: Summary
The contribution of membrane interfacial interactions to recognition of membrane-embedded antigens by antibodies is currently unclear. This report demonstrates the optimization of this type of antibodies via chemical modification of regions near the membrane but not directly involved in the recognition of the epitope. Using the HIV-1 antibody 10E8 as a model, linear and polycyclic synthetic aromatic compounds are introduced at selected sites. Molecular dynamics simulations predict the favorable interactions of these synthetic compounds with the viral lipid membrane, where the epitope of the HIV-1 glycoprotein Env is located. Chemical modification of 10E8 with aromatic acetamides facilitates the productive and specific recognition of the native antigen, partially buried in the crowded environment of the viral membrane, resulting in a dramatic increase of its capacity to block viral infection. These observations support the harnessing of interfacial affinity through site-selective chemical modification to optimize the function of antibodies that target membrane-proximal epitopes.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage often induces heterogeneous cell-fate responses, such as cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we characterize the transcriptome response of cultured colon cancer cell lines to 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-induced DNA damage. After 5FU treatment, a single population of colon cancer cells adopts three distinct transcriptome phenotypes, which correspond to diversified cell-fate responses: apoptosis, cell-cycle checkpoint, and stress resistance. Although some genes are regulated uniformly across all groups of cells, many genes showed group-specific expression patterns mediating DNA damage responses specific to the corresponding cell fate. Some of these observations are reproduced at the protein level by flow cytometry and are replicated in cells treated with other 5FU-unrelated genotoxic drugs, camptothecin and etoposide. This work provides a resource for understanding heterogeneous DNA damage responses involving fractional killing and chemoresistance, which are among the major challenges in current cancer chemotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
In multiple cortical areas, including the motor cortex, neurons have similar firing rate statistics whether we observe or execute movements. These “congruent” neurons are hypothesized to support action understanding by participating in a neural circuit consistently activated in both observed and executed movements. We examined this hypothesis by analyzing neural population structure and dynamics between observed and executed movements. We find that observed and executed movements exhibit similar neural population covariation in a shared subspace capturing significant neural variance. Further, neural dynamics are more similar between observed and executed movements within the shared subspace than outside it. Finally, we find that this shared subspace has a heterogeneous composition of congruent and incongruent neurons. Together, these results argue that similar neural covariation and dynamics between observed and executed movements do not occur via activation of a subpopulation of congruent single neurons, but through consistent temporal activation of a heterogeneous neural population.

Abstract: Summary
PIK3CA, encoding the PI3Kα isoform, is the most frequently mutated oncogene in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors are used clinically but intrinsic and acquired resistance limits their utility. Improved selection of patients that will benefit from these drugs requires predictive biomarkers. We show here that persistent FOXM1 expression following drug treatment is a biomarker of resistance to PI3Kα inhibition in ER+ breast cancer. FOXM1 drives expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) but not hexokinase 2 (HK-II). The downstream metabolic changes can therefore be detected using MRI of LDH-catalyzed hyperpolarized 13C label exchange between pyruvate and lactate but not by positron emission tomography measurements of HK-II-mediated trapping of the glucose analog 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose. Rapid assessment of treatment response in breast cancer using this imaging method could help identify patients that benefit from PI3Kα inhibition and design drug combinations to counteract the emergence of resistance.

Here, we use single-cell epigenomics to profile chromatin state transitions in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We identify an epigenomic continuum representing loss of cellular identity and progression toward a metastatic state. We define co-accessible regulatory programs and infer key activating and repressive chromatin regulators of these cell states. Among these co-accessibility programs, we identify a pre-metastatic transition, characterized by activation of RUNX transcription factors, which mediates extracellular matrix remodeling to promote metastasis and is predictive of survival across human LUAD patients. Together, these results demonstrate the power of single-cell epigenomics to identify regulatory programs to uncover mechanisms and key biomarkers of tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
By studying healthy women who do not request analgesia during their first delivery, we investigate genetic effects on labor pain. Such women have normal sensory and psychometric test results, except for significantly higher cuff pressure pain. We find an excess of heterozygotes carrying the rare allele of SNP rs140124801 in KCNG4. The rare variant KV6.4-Met419 has a dominant-negative effect and cannot modulate the voltage dependence of KV2.1 inactivation because it fails to traffic to the plasma membrane. In vivo, Kcng4 (KV6.4) expression occurs in 40% of retrograde-labeled mouse uterine sensory neurons, all of which express KV2.1, and over 90% express the nociceptor genes Trpv1 and Scn10a. In neurons overexpressing KV6.4-Met419, the voltage dependence of inactivation for KV2.1 is more depolarized compared with neurons overexpressing KV6.4. Finally, KV6.4-Met419-overexpressing neurons have a higher action potential threshold. We conclude that KV6.4 can influence human labor pain by modulating the excitability of uterine nociceptors.

Abstract: Summary
Targeted inhibition of oncogenic pathways can be highly effective in halting the rapid growth of tumors but often leads to the emergence of slowly dividing persister cells, which constitute a reservoir for the selection of drug-resistant clones. In BRAFV600E melanomas, RAF and MEK inhibitors efficiently block oncogenic signaling, but persister cells emerge. Here, we show that persister cells escape drug-induced cell-cycle arrest via brief, sporadic ERK pulses generated by transmembrane receptors and growth factors operating in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Quantitative proteomics and computational modeling show that ERK pulsing is enabled by rewiring of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling: from an oncogenic BRAFV600E monomer-driven configuration that is drug sensitive to a receptor-driven configuration that involves Ras-GTP and RAF dimers and is highly resistant to RAF and MEK inhibitors. Altogether, this work shows that pulsatile MAPK activation by factors in the microenvironment generates a persistent population of melanoma cells that rewires MAPK signaling to sustain non-genetic drug resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Psychiatric disorders are highly heritable pathologies of altered neural circuit functioning. How genetic mutations lead to specific neural circuit abnormalities underlying behavioral disruptions, however, remains unclear. Using circuit-selective transgenic tools and a mouse model of maladaptive social behavior (ArpC3 mutant), we identify a neural circuit mechanism driving dysfunctional social behavior. We demonstrate that circuit-selective knockout (ctKO) of the ArpC3 gene within prefrontal cortical neurons that project to the basolateral amygdala elevates the excitability of the circuit neurons, leading to disruption of socially evoked neural activity and resulting in abnormal social behavior. Optogenetic activation of this circuit in wild-type mice recapitulates the social dysfunction observed in ArpC3 mutant mice. Finally, the maladaptive sociability of ctKO mice is rescued by optogenetically silencing neurons within this circuit. These results highlight a mechanism of how a gene-to-neural circuit interaction drives altered social behavior, a common phenotype of several psychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin dynamics play a critical role in cell fate determination and maintenance by regulating the expression of genes essential for development and differentiation. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), maintenance of pluripotency coincides with a poised chromatin state containing active and repressive histone modifications. However, the structural features of poised chromatin are largely uncharacterized. By adopting mild time-course MNase-seq with computational analysis, the low-compact chromatin in mESCs is featured in two groups: one in more open regions, corresponding to an active state, and the other enriched with bivalent histone modifications, considered the poised state. A parameter called the chromatin opening potential index (COPI) is also devised to quantify the transcription potential based on the dynamic changes of MNase-seq signals at promoter regions. Use of COPI provides effective prediction of gene activation potential and, more importantly, reveals a few developmental factors essential for mouse neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferon (IFN) plays an essential role in the host innate immune responses. Several ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) family members were reported to regulate type I IFN production and host antiviral immune responses. However, the molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood. Here, we report that UBE2S acts as a negative regulator in the type I IFN signaling pathway. Ectopic expression of UBE2S inhibits host antiviral immune responses and enhances viral replications, whereas deficiency of UBE2S enhances host antiviral immune responses and suppresses viral replications both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of type І IFN production by UBE2S is independent on its E2 and E3 enzymic activity. Mechanistically, UBE2S interacts with TBK1 and recruits ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) to remove Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chains of TBK1. Our findings reveal a role of the UBE2S-USP15-TBK1 axis in the regulation of host antiviral innate immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone functions as a protein-folding buffer and plays a role promoting the evolution of new heritable traits. To better understand how Hsp90 can affect mRNA translation, we screen more than 1,600 factors involved in mRNA regulation for physical interactions with Hsp90 in human cells. The mRNA binding protein CPEB2 strongly binds Hsp90 via its prion domain. In a yeast model, transient inhibition of Hsp90 results in persistent activation of a CPEB translation reporter even in the absence of exogenous CPEB that persists for 30 generations after the inhibitor is removed. Ribosomal profiling reveals that some endogenous yeast mRNAs, including HAC1, show a persistent change in translation efficiency following transient Hsp90 inhibition. Thus, transient loss of Hsp90 function can promote a nongenetic inheritance of a translational state affecting specific mRNAs, introducing a mechanism by which Hsp90 can promote phenotypic variation.

Abstract: Summary
Major depressive disorder (MDD) presents with two primary symptoms: depressed mood and anhedonia, which suggests that distinct neuronal circuits may regulate MDD. However, the underlying circuits of these individual symptoms linked to depression remain elusive. Herein, we identify a discrete circuit of tachykinin precursor 1 (Tac1)-expressing neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) lateral shell, which project to ventral pallidum and contribute to stress-induced anhedonia-like behavior. Selective inhibition and activation of Tac1NAc neurons bidirectionally modulate stress susceptibility, revealing that Tac1 neurons in the NAc are critical for regulating anhedonia-like behaviors. We find that a subpopulation of VP neurons receives inhibitory inputs from Tac1NAc neurons and exhibits decreased excitability in susceptible mice. Furthermore, the inhibition of the neurokinin 1 receptor promotes susceptibility to social stress. Overall, our study reveals a discrete circuit regulating anhedonia-like behavior in mice.

Abstract: Summary
It is currently assumed that 3D chromosomal organization plays a central role in transcriptional control. However, depletion of cohesin and CTCF affects the steady-state levels of only a minority of transcripts. Here, we use high-resolution Capture Hi-C to interrogate the dynamics of chromosomal contacts of all annotated human gene promoters upon degradation of cohesin and CTCF. We show that a majority of promoter-anchored contacts are lost in these conditions, but many contacts with distinct properties are maintained, and some new ones are gained. The rewiring of contacts between promoters and active enhancers upon cohesin degradation associates with rapid changes in target gene transcription as detected by SLAM sequencing (SLAM-seq). These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited, but consistent, effects of cohesin and CTCF depletion on steady-state transcription and suggest the existence of both cohesin-dependent and -independent mechanisms of enhancer-promoter pairing.

Abstract: Summary
The metabolic program of osteoblasts, the chief bone-making cells, remains incompletely understood. Here in murine calvarial cells, we establish that osteoblast differentiation under aerobic conditions is coupled with a marked increase in glucose consumption and lactate production but reduced oxygen consumption. As a result, aerobic glycolysis accounts for approximately 80% of the ATP production in mature osteoblasts. In vivo tracing with 13C-labeled glucose in the mouse shows that glucose in bone is readily metabolized to lactate but not organic acids in the TCA cycle. Glucose tracing in osteoblast cultures reveals that pyruvate is carboxylated to form malate integral to the malate-aspartate shuttle. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identifies Me2, encoding the mitochondrial NAD-dependent isoform of malic enzyme, as being specifically upregulated during osteoblast differentiation. Knockdown of Me2 markedly reduces the glycolytic flux and impairs osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Thus, the mitochondrial malic enzyme functionally couples the mitochondria with aerobic glycolysis in osteoblasts.

Abstract: Summary
A beneficial gut Bacteroides-folate-liver pathway regulating lipid metabolism is demonstrated. Oral administration of a Ganoderma meroterpene derivative (GMD) ameliorates nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis in the liver of fa/fa rats by reducing endotoxemia, enhancing lipid oxidation, decreasing de novo lipogenesis, and suppressing lipid export from the liver. An altered gut microbiota with an increase of butyrate and folate plays a causative role in the effects of GMD. The commensal bacteria Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides dorei, and Bacteroides uniformis, which are enriched by GMD, are major contributors to the increased gut folate. Administration of live B. xylanisolvens reduces hepatic steatosis and enhances the folate-mediated signaling pathways in mice. Knockout of the folate biosynthetic folp gene in B. xylanisolvens blocks its folate production and beneficial effects. This work confirms the therapeutic potential of GMD and B. xylanisolvens in alleviating nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis and provides evidence for benefits of the gut Bacteroides-folate-liver pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The Ras/PI3K/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signaling network plays fundamental roles in cell growth, survival, and migration and is frequently activated in cancer. Here, we show that the activities of the signaling network propagate as coordinated waves, biased by growth factor, which drive actin-based protrusions in human epithelial cells. The network exhibits hallmarks of biochemical excitability: the annihilation of oppositely directed waves, all-or-none responsiveness, and refractoriness. Abrupt perturbations to Ras, PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4)P2, ERK, and TORC2 alter the threshold, observations that define positive and negative feedback loops within the network. Oncogenic transformation dramatically increases the wave activity, the frequency of ERK pulses, and the sensitivity to EGF stimuli. Wave activity was progressively enhanced across a series of increasingly metastatic breast cancer cell lines. The view that oncogenic transformation is a shift to a lower threshold of excitable Ras/PI3K/ERK network, caused by various combinations of genetic insults, can facilitate the assessment of cancer severity and effectiveness of interventions.

Abstract: Summary
Early embryonic development is driven exclusively by maternal gene products deposited into the oocyte. Although critical in establishing early developmental programs, maternal gene functions have remained elusive due to a paucity of techniques for their systematic disruption and assessment. CRISPR-Cas13 systems have recently been employed to degrade RNA in yeast, plants, and mammalian cell lines. However, no systematic study of the potential of Cas13 has been carried out in an animal system. Here, we show that CRISPR-RfxCas13d (CasRx) is an effective and precise system to deplete specific mRNA transcripts in zebrafish embryos. We demonstrate that zygotically expressed and maternally provided transcripts are efficiently targeted, resulting in a 76% average decrease in transcript levels and recapitulation of well-known embryonic phenotypes. Moreover, we show that this system can be used in medaka, killifish, and mouse embryos. Altogether, our results demonstrate that CRISPR-RfxCas13d is an efficient knockdown platform to interrogate gene function in animal embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Cytokine activation of cells induces gene networks involved in inflammation and immunity. Transient gene activation can have a lasting effect even in the absence of ongoing transcription, known as long-term transcriptional memory. Here we explore the nature of the establishment and maintenance of interferon γ (IFNγ)-induced priming of human cells. We find that, although ongoing transcription and local chromatin signatures are short-lived, the IFNγ-primed state stably propagates through at least 14 cell division cycles. Single-cell analysis reveals that memory is manifested by an increased probability of primed cells to engage in target gene expression, correlating with the strength of initial gene activation. Further, we find that strongly memorized genes tend to reside in genomic clusters and that long-term memory of these genes is locally restricted by cohesin. We define the duration, stochastic nature, and molecular mechanisms of IFNγ-induced transcriptional memory, relevant to understanding enhanced innate immune signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Abnormal activation of calcium channels has been shown to play crucial roles in tumor occurrence and development. However, the role of inhibitors targeting calcium channels in tumor progression and immune regulation remains unclear, and their clinical applications are still limited. We show that nifedipine (NIFE), a calcium channel blocker, inhibits calcium influx to impair nuclear factor of activated T cell 2 (NFAT2) dephosphorylation, activation, and nuclear translocation, thus preventing transcriptional activation of downstream signaling molecules to suppress colorectal cancer (CRC) proliferation and metastasis. In addition, NIFE decreases expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on CRC cells and programmed death-1 (PD-1) on CD8+ T cells and reactivates tumor immune monitoring, which may stimulate or enhance PD-1-based antitumor immunotherapy. Our findings provide direct evidence that NIFE is a promising clinical therapy to treat patients with advanced CRC by affecting the tumor itself and tumor immunity. NIFE may be a promising therapeutic option to enhance effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in CRC.
