Abstract: In this paper, the use of hot solvent vapor (HSV) annealing is demonstrated to improve the performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs) fabricated by the spray process. The blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT/PCBM) is used as a photoactive layer of the solar cell. Compared to the conventional solvent vapor annealing, the HSV annealing can eliminate the formation of intra-droplet boundary during the spray process and optimize the nanostructure of the film quickly (≤5min). The study of conducting atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) reveals that the HSV annealed film exhibits smooth film surface and homogenous conductivity distribution. Moreover, an enhanced light harvesting and increased crystallinity of P3HT in the active layer are observed by UV–vis absorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD). With subsequent thermal annealing, the power conversion efficiency of solar cell made from the HSV annealed film is reached at 3.61%. This HSV annealing technique can be implemented into the fabrication of high efficient large-area PSCs using the spray process.

Abstract: The advantages of high mechanical flexibility of organic polymers that are suitable for the roll-to-roll processing technique have recently assisted its fast progress towards fabricating large-area organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices on flexible substrates including plastics and metals. We fabricated the inverted OPV devices on various metals namely: stainless steel (SS), titanium coated steel (Ti-S), chromium coated aluminium (Cr-Al), and aluminium (Al). Around 3.1% power conversion efficiency (PCE) was achieved on the SS and Cr-Al substrates for the poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester (P3HT:PCBM) OPV devices while only 1.48% PCE of the OPV devices was obtained on the Ti-S substrate and no effective devices were presented on the Al substrate. Morphologies of the metal substrates and the active P3HT:PCBM layer were investigated by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the tapping mode atomic force microscope (AFM), separately. We revealed why different metal substrates can provide significantly different performance for the inverted OPV devices by the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Abstract: In this study grain boundaries (GBs) and grain interiors in a sulfurized Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) photovoltaic thin film have been investigated by atom probe tomography. Grain boundaries could be clearly localized by the strong agglomeration of sodium, which was additionally observed in tube-shaped clusters. These GBs were proven to contain no oxygen or alkali metals which confirms the blocking function of the used diffusion barrier sputtered on the soda lime glass substrate. Further, the concentrations of the CIGSSe matrix atoms across the GBs were studied. Here, copper deficiency and enrichment appear to be correlated with the distance from the back contact (BC). Agglomeration of sulfur in all grain boundaries near to the BC indicates interface diffusion of sulfur. Moreover, our measurements reveal the existence of a thin layer upon the back contact in which the sulfur, copper and gallium contents are significantly increased. The corresponding band-gap widening may establish the function of minority carrier repulsion from the back contact.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the role of c-Myc/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway in sensitization of human hepatoma HepG2 cells to TRAIL. Knockdown of SIRT1 or treatment with SIRT1 inhibitor caused the up-regulation of DR5 and down-regulation of c-FLIP through modulation of c-Myc/ATF4/CHOP pathway, and subsequently enhanced the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of TRAIL on HepG2 cells. Interestingly, SIRT1 interacted directly with c-FLIPL and Ku70, and treatment with SIRT1 inhibitor enhanced acetylation of Ku70 and subsequently decreased its binding to c-FLIP. And this was followed by degradation of c-FLIP. Moreover, Ku70−/− MEF and Ku70-knockdown HepG2 cells showed the increased levels of c-Myc, ATF4, CHOP, and DR5 and decreased level of c-FLIP. These results were followed by increased sensitivity of Ku70−/− MEF cells and Ku70-knockdown HepG2 cells to TRAIL compared with their control cells. These findings reveal for the first time that SIRT1 inhibition increases Ku70 acetylation, and the acetylated Ku70 with a decreased function mediates the induction of DR5 and the down-regulation of c-FLIP by up-regulating c-Myc/ATF4/CHOP pathway, and consequently promotes the TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells. This study provides important mechanistic insight of the synergism exhibited by SIRT1 inhibition and TRAIL.

Abstract: Infection with Helicobacter pylori is important in the development and progression of gastric cancer. However, the mechanisms that regulate this activation in gastric tumors remain elusive. CACUL1 has been cloned and identified as a novel gene that is expressed in many types of cancer and is involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor growth. The current study aimed to examine the expression of CACUL1 in gastric cancer samples and analyze its correlation with H. pylori infection. We found that CACUL1 was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and negatively correlated with gastric cancer differentiation and TNM stage. In addition, CACUL1 expression was high in H. pylori-infected tissues compared with H. pylori non-infected tissue. We found that H. pylori could up-regulate CACUL1 expression through activating protein 1. The up-regulation of CACUL1 expression could promote matrix metalloproteinase 9 and Slug expression to increase invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. These results suggested that H. pylori-triggered CACUL1 production occurred in an activating protein 1-dependent manner and regulated matrix metalloproteinase 9 and Slug expression to affect the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Therefore, CACUL1 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of aggressive gastric cancer.

Abstract: Naphthalene derivatives such as 1-fluoronaohthalene, 1-chloronaohthalene, 1-bromonaohthalene, and 1-iodonaohthalene were introduced to poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT): [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) as processing additives. To investigate why the addition of naphthalene derivatives improved the efficiency of PSCs, the photon absorbance properties were observed using UV–vis spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL). Then, the degree of crystallinity of P3HT was examined through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. In addition, changes in the nanostructure and surface morphology of the P3HT:PC61BM blend film were observed through atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) of the fabricated PSCs were 8.77Ωcm2 and 2337Ωcm2, respectively. The short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) were 9.7mA/cm2, 0.636V, and 63.6%, respectively. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was 3.9%.

Abstract: The neurotensin (NT) receptor-3 (NTSR3), also called sortilin, is thought to display several functions including a role as a receptor or a co-receptor, in the sorting to plasma membrane and to lysosomes, and in the regulated secretion. The aim of this study was to investigate the function of the soluble form of NTSR3 (sNTSR3) released from several cell lines including colonic cancer cells. The human adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line HT29 has been used to monitor the release, the binding and internalization of sNTSR3 by radioreceptor assays and confocal microscopy. The modulation of the intracellular signaling pathways by the protein has been investigated by using Fura-2 fluorescence calcium imaging microscopy and Western blots analysis. We demonstrated that sNTSR3 specifically binds and internalizes into HT29 cells. This binding, independent from the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, leads to the increase of intracellular calcium concentration and to the activation of a FAK/Src-dependent activation of the PI3 kinase pathway. In conclusion, sNTSR3 released from the membrane bound NTSR3 is a functional protein able to activate intracellular pathways involved in cell survival but probably not in cell growth.

Mechanism of resistance to S138A substituted enfuvirtide and its application to peptide design,

Abstract: T-20 (enfuvirtide) resistance is caused by the N43D primary resistance mutation at its presumed binding site at the N-terminal heptad repeat (N-HR) of gp41, accompanied by the S138A secondary mutation at the C-terminal HR of gp41 (C-HR). We have discovered that modifying T-20 to include S138A (T-20S138A) allows it to efficiently block wild-type and T20-resistant viruses, by a mechanism that involves improved binding of T-20S138A to the N-HR that contains the N43D primary mutation. To determine how HIV-1 in turn escapes T-20S138A we used a dose escalation method to select T-20S138A-resistant HIV-1 starting with either wild-type (HIV-1WT) or T-20-resistant (HIV-1N43D/S138A) virus. We found that when starting with WT background, I37N and L44M emerged in the N-HR of gp41, and N126K in the C-HR. However, when starting with HIV-1N43D/S138A, L33S and I69L emerged in N-HR, and E137K in C-HR. T-20S138A-resistant recombinant HIV-1 showed cross-resistance to other T-20 derivatives, but not to C34 derivatives, suggesting that T-20S138A suppressed HIV-1 replication by a similar mechanism to T-20. Furthermore, E137K enhanced viral replication kinetics and restored binding affinity with N-HR containing N43D, indicating that it acts as a secondary, compensatory mutation. We therefore introduced E137K into T-20S138A (T-20E137K/S138A) and revealed that T-20E137K/S138A moderately suppressed replication of T-20S138A-resistant HIV-1. T-20E137K/S138A retained activity to HIV-1 without L33S, which seems to be a key mutation for T-20 derivatives. Our data demonstrate that secondary mutations can be consistently used for the design of peptide inhibitors that block replication of HIV resistant to fusion inhibitors.

ATP-P2X4 signaling mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation: A novel pathway of diabetic nephropathy,

Abstract: Tubulointerstitial inflammation plays a key role in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Cytokines in the IL-1 family are the key pro-inflammatory cytokines of tubulointerstitial inflammation. Extracellular ATP can cause P2X receptors to activate the NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and cause IL-1β and IL-18 maturation and release. We investigated the role of ATP-P2X4 signaling in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and renal interstitial inflammation characteristic of DN. Ex vivo studies, P2X4 showed increased expression in renal tubule epithelial cells in patients with nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes compared to those in the control group. Linear correlation analysis shows that P2X4 expression was positively related with urine IL-1β and IL-18 levels. Moreover, P2X4 expression was co-localized with NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 expression. In vitro culture experiments showed NLRP3 protein expression, cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β, and release of IL-1β, IL-18 and ATP in HK-2 cells significantly increased after high glucose stimulation. However, apyrase, which consumes extracellular ATP, completely blocked the changes caused by high glucose. The P2 receptor antagonist suramin, P2X receptor antagonist TNP-ATP, P2X4 selective antagonist 5-BDBD, and P2X4 gene silencing attenuated NLRP3 expression, cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β, and release of IL-1β and IL-18 induced by high glucose. Taken together, these results suggest that ATP-P2X4 signaling mediates high glucose-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, regulates IL-1 family cytokine secretion, and causes the development of tubulointerstitial inflammation in DN.

Abstract: A description of the synthesis procedure is provided for a new squaraine molecule, DiPSQ(OH)2. This molecule is an interesting target molecule for organic photovoltaics (OPV) because of its unusually broad panchromaticity, suggesting a tighter molecular packing than would be expected, given its bulky alkyl side groups. UV–vis–NIR absorption data provides evidence for the presence of both H- and J-aggregates. Thin film X-ray diffraction (TFXRD) data supports the presence of one dominant crystal structure. Further interpretation of TFXRD results and complementary Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) characterization for pure and blended samples provides a comprehensive explanation of how DiPSQ(OH)2 aggregates are affected by annealing and crystal growth. The described aggregation properties of donor–acceptor blends for solar cells are strongly dependent on annealing. Influencing phase separation, local crystallinity, and macroscopic crystallization, these physical properties are known to significantly impact charge dissociation, exciton diffusion rates, and bulk charge transport in devices. The strategy of systematically varying annealing times has resulted in improved bulk heterojunction crystallinity and regions of increased phase separation, both necessary to achieve the long term goal of morphological control for commercially viable NIR-active OPV devices.

Abstract: Intermediate band materials incorporate a collection of energy levels with special optoelectronic properties within the semiconductor bandgap. This feature broadens the energy range of the solar spectrum useful for photovoltaic conversion and has the potential for enabling both high-current and high-voltage photovoltaic cells. Here we present our preliminary results on a novel intermediate band solar cell based on creating an intermediate band through the incorporation of a large concentration of Ti atoms in a GaAs crystal. The characterization of the material verifies a high concentration of incorporated Ti and the absence of structural defects. The cells show below-bandgap photon absorption with a likely contribution from As antisites and Ga vacancies. The initially degraded open-circuit voltage of the cells exhibits a high voltage recovery from 0.1V (at room temperature and one-sun irradiance conditions) to 1.4V (at low temperature and concentrated light).

Abstract: An overview of the current status of CdTe solar cells and modules with respect to life cycle management of raw materials is provided. Actively managing raw materials throughout the product life cycle can help to manage cost and conserve resources for large-scale PV deployment. Among the various materials management strategies, a primary factor influencing the material intensity of PV systems is module conversion efficiency. CdTe record solar cell and module efficiency has recently increased to 19.6% and 16.1%, respectively. Future projections include improving CdTe solar cell efficiency to 22% as well as achieving an average CdTe production line module efficiency of 17% by 2017. Material and energy usage across life cycle stages (module manufacturing, balance of systems, collection and recycling) have been documented in life cycle inventories. An example of life cycle materials management is water management, where specific strategies include minimizing electricity use in PV module manufacturing, improving PV module efficiency, deploying tracking systems, developing a water balance for PV manufacturing facilities, minimizing grading during construction, using dry brush cleaning methods during operation, and recycling end-of-life systems. Due to low life cycle water usage, solar PV provides a potential path forward for addressing the energy–water nexus with solar desalination as an example application, such as the CdTe PV Greenough River Solar Farm in Western Australia.

Abstract: Cell adhesion on an extracellular matrix (ECM) participates in cell motility, invasion, cell signal transduction and gene expression. Many nuclear proteins regulate cell-ECM adhesion through managing the transcription of cell adhesion-related genes. Here, we identified MARVEL [MAL (The myelin and lymphocyte protein) and related proteins for vesicle trafficking and membrane link] domain containing 1 (MARVELD1) that could suppress cell spreading and complicate actin organization. Over-expression of MARVELD1 in NIH3T3 cells decreased the expression level of integrin β1 and vinculin, and further led to dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr 397. We also found that MARVELD1 partially colocalized with serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SC35) and interacted with nuclear cap binding protein subunit 2 (CBP20). Finally, we demonstrated that pre-mRNA processing of integrin β1 was affected by MARVELD1. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that MARVELD1 plays a role in pre-mRNA processing of integrin β1, and thereby regulates cell adhesion and cell motility. These studies provide a novel regulatory mechanism of cell-ECM adhesion by nuclear protein in cells.

Abstract: Performance degradation is one of the most important metrics for the evaluation of solar cells. In this paper we show that water is the primary species determining the degradation rate of electrical properties of Al/Ca/P3HT:PC61BM/PEDOT:PSS/ITO photovoltaic cells. This is accomplished by varying the diffusion rate of reactive species (oxygen, water) present in air through solar cell encapsulation with polyethylene terephthalate (PET), Kapton and silica glass.

Abstract: This paper describes for the first time a feasible strategy to prepare efficient hybrid solar cells that combine ideal bulk-heterojunction architecture and wide spectral response in ternary photoactive layer. CuInS2 quantum dots (CuInS2-QDs) with different sizes were controllably synthesized by the solvothermal method; MEH-PPV–CuInS2 hybrids for harvesting photons in a broad spectral range up to 900nm were prepared by blending CuInS2-QDs with poly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV), in which CuInS2-QDs aggregate into continuous and highly condensed interpenetrating nanochannels with the presence of effective MEH-PPV/CuInS2 interface for the energy transfer from MEH-PPV to CuInS2-QDs. Solar cells were fabricated by using the MEH-PPV–CuInS2 hybrids as light-harvester and vertically aligned TiO2 nanorod array (TiO2-NA) as a straightforward electron transporter, producing MEH-PPV–CuInS2/TiO2-NA devices with a ternary photoactive layer, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.60% was achieved under AM1.5 illumination. Compared to MEH-PPV/TiO2-NA binary solar cells, MEH-PPV–CuInS2/TiO2-NA ternary devices exhibit a much larger photocurrent and thereby efficiency. It is demonstrated that, in the ternary solar cells, photocurrent generation correlates dominantly with the light absorption property of MEH-PPV–CuInS2 hybrids, while open-circuit voltage is still mainly determined by the energy difference between the conduction band edge of TiO2 nanorods and the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the polymer. Based on the morphology and band alignments in the ternary system, the contributions of CuInS2-QDs to device performance and the related charge generation and transport processes are described.

Abstract: Inverted all polymer solar cells based on a blend of a perylene diimide based polymer acceptor and a dithienosilole based polymer donor were fabricated from small area devices to roll-to-roll (R2R) coated and printed large area modules. The device performance was successfully optimized by using solvent additive to tune the phase separation. By adding 2% chloronaphthalene as solvent additive for small area (0.25cm2) devices, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 0.63% was achieved for inverted geometry, higher than that (0.39%) of conventional geometry. This polymer blend showed excellent solution processibility and R2R coated and printed large area (4.2cm2) solar cells exhibited a PCE of 0.20%.

In this article, VO2-based films with increased microroughness are prepared by polymer assisted deposition, and ZnCl2 is added to the precursor solution to control the microstructure of the films. Addition of ZnCl2 increases the microroughness of films through phase separation, which largely decreases the refraction index and the reflectivity of the films, resulting in enhanced luminous transmittance and solar transmittance modulation; two films with balanced optical performance show Tlum=50.5% and ΔTsol=11.3%, and Tlum=59.3% and ΔTsol=10.5%, respectively. Moreover, this kind of microstructure control has no influence on doping VO2, which is proven by the deposition and characterization of W-doped VO2-based films. By the formation of a W-doped VO2/F:SnO2/glass multilayer stack, a film shows excellent thermochromic properties and low emissivities; typically, a film with a phase transition temperature, Tlum, ΔTsol of 43.4°C, 30.0%, 8.82%, respectively, and emissivity of 0.20 for monoclinic and 0.33 for rutile phase is successfully prepared.

Abstract: Bulk heterojunction in organic solar cells allows adequate interfaces for the dissociation of photo-generated excitons. However, the intermixed donor- and acceptor-like materials do not guarantee successful carrier transport and collections. In this work, we demonstrate ubiquitous carrier harvesting characteristics by using embedded indium–tin-oxide nano-electrodes (NEs) with a conformal electro-polymerized coating of a hole conducting layer. Compared to its planar electrode counterpart, this device exhibits internal quantum efficiency insensitive to the distribution of carrier generation, as determined by angle-resolved absorption spectroscopy and photocurrent characteristics. The ubiquitous carrier harvesting characteristics offer a viable solution to organic thin-film devices fabricated on flexible substrates or operated under diffused ambient light.

The Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor BH3I-2′ affects the dynamics and subcellular localization of sumoylated proteins,

Abstract: Sumoylation modulates many proteins implicated in apoptosis such as Fas, TNFR1, Daxx, p53 and its regulator MDM2. Some of these proteins, such as DRP-1, are involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The intrinsic pathway is regulated at the mitochondrial level by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The small-molecule inhibitor BH3I-2′ binds to the hydrophobic groove of the BH3 domain of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. Following treatment with this inhibitor in various experimental conditions, we observed decreased levels of detergent-soluble SUMO-1, an increase in the relative levels of detergent-insoluble sumoylated proteins, or both. Accordingly, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the relative numbers and intensities of endogenously or exogenously expressed SUMO-1 foci in the nucleus were increased following BH3I-2′ treatment. MG132 caused a large increase in steady-state levels of SUMO-1 and of sumoylated proteins, and this was especially true for detergent-insoluble proteins. The conjugation-incompetent GG-to-AA SUMO-1 mutant, which did not form nuclear foci, was only present in the detergent-soluble lysate fraction and was insensitive to BH3I-2′, implying that BH3I-2′ specifically affects SUMO in its conjugated form. Finally, BH3I-2′ had similar effects on SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 as it had on SUMO-1. In conclusion, BH3I-2′ causes an intracellular redistribution of sumoylated proteins, more specifically their targeting to PML and non-PML nuclear bodies in which they may be degraded by the proteasome. Interestingly, knocking down Bcl-2 also altered levels of sumoylated proteins and their presence in detergent-insoluble compartments, confirming the role of Bcl-2 as a modulator of the sumoylation pathway.

Abstract: Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is a 1-Cys member of the peroxiredoxin superfamily that plays an important role in antioxidant defense. Glutathionylation of recombinant Prdx6 mediated by π glutathione S-transferase (GST) is required for reduction of the oxidized Cys and completion of the peroxidatic catalytic cycle in vitro. This study investigated the requirement for πGST in intact cells. Transfection with a plasmid construct expressing πGST into MCF7, a cell line that lacks endogenous πGST, significantly increased phospholipid peroxidase activity as measured in cell lysates and protected intact cells against a peroxidative stress. siRNA knockdown indicated that this increased peroxidase activity was Prdx6 dependent. Interaction between πGST and Prdx6, evaluated by the Duolink Proximity Ligation Assay, was minimal under basal conditions but increased dramatically following treatment of cells with the oxidant, tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Interaction was abolished by mutation of C47, the active site for Prdx6 peroxidase activity. Depletion of cellular GSH by treatment of cells with buthionine sulfoximine had no effect on the interaction of Prdx6 and πGST. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidation of the catalytic cysteine in Prdx6 is required for its interaction with πGST and that the interaction plays an important role in regenerating the peroxidase activity of Prdx6.

Abstract: Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), a novel effector molecule of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg), mediates its suppressive activity through binding to low affinity Fcγ receptors expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs). FGL2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis, xeno- and allotransplant rejection, and rheumatoid arthritis. Here we fully analyzed the structure–function relationships of recombinant murine FGL2 generated in COS-7 cells and identified the receptor binding domains. Native FGL2 exists as an oligomer with a molecular weight of approximately 260kDa, while under reducing conditions, FGL2 has a molecular weight of 65kDa suggesting that native FGL2 is composed of four monomers. By site-directed mutation, cysteines at positions 94, 97, 184 and 187, found in the coiled-coil domain were shown to be crucial for FGL2 oligomerization. Monomeric FGL2 had a lower affinity binding to APCs, but increased immunosuppressive activity compared to oligomeric FGL2. Deglycosylation demonstrated that sugar moieties are critical for maintaining solubility of FGL2. SWISS-MODEL analysis suggested that FGL2 has a similar tertiary structure with other members of the fibrinogen family such as fibrinogen and tachylectin. Mutational analysis of cysteine residues and Western blots suggested an asymmetric bouquet-shaped quaternary structure for oligomeric FGL2, resembling many pattern-recognition molecules in the lectin pathway of innate immunity. The functional motifs of FGL2 were mapped to the C terminal globular domain, using a peptide blockade assay. These results collectively define the biochemical and immunological determinants of FGL2, an important immunosuppressive molecule of Treg providing important insights for designing FGL2-related therapeutics.

Abstract: The eigenfunctions and the interband photon absorption of a solar quantum well solar cell are calculated using the K.p Empirical Hamiltonian developed for quantum dot solar cells. The calculations are compared with the measured quantum efficiency in a prototype quantum well solar cell. The agreement is reasonably good. The absorption with quantum wells is found to be much greater than with quantum dots. This is due, besides the higher number of states, to the partially extended nature of quantum well wavefunctions that leads to photon matrix elements which are substantially different to those applicable to quantumdots.

Abstract: BLU is a tumor suppressor protein that is down-regulated in ovarian and cervical cancers. Its cellular biological functions appear related to cancer inhibition. We presently demonstrate that BLU has direct anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects on ovarian carcinoma and human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro by the arrest of the cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. BLU in combination with gemcitabine arrested the cell cycle at the G1–G0 phase and induced apoptosis. BLU actively contributed to cell growth by enhancing gemcitabine-inhibited cell migration and tubule formation in angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. The combined treatment with BLU and gemcitabine further activated p53 and p21 expression, whereas the productions of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and nuclear factor-kappa B proteins were decreased, with BLU possibly being more effective in the treatment of ovarian cancer when given in combination with gemcitabine, rather than as a single agent. Furthermore, as expected, BLU plus gemcitabine significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of signaling modulators downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, such as phospho-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin, as well as hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor. Taken together, our results provide evidence that BLU can effectively regulate the pro-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic activity of gemcitabine through the direct interaction with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, as well as the up-regulation of p21 and p53 expression.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel geometry for a photovoltaic module. This novel geometry employs light trapping effects to split the solar spectrum onto two different kinds of solar cells. The two different kinds of solar cells utilize different parts of the solar spectrum most efficiently. The proposed structure is based on prisms. The different kinds of solar cells are attached to opposing surfaces of the prisms. To achieve spectral selectivity, either spectrally selective filters or the solar cells itself are used. After introducing the general concept, we discuss different possible realizations. The theoretical potential of the light trap is calculated using the concept of spectral efficiency. Based on experimental solar cell data, we calculate theoretically that conversion efficiencies exceeding 30% are possible with such a module using silicon and GaAs solar cells. First experiments show that the optical losses of the proposed geometry are as low as 2.1% relative.

Abstract: A new conjugated polymer containing pentaselenophene (5Se) electron donor moieties was designed for use in polymer solar cells and synthesized via a Stille coupling reaction. The structure, optical properties, electrochemical properties, hole mobility, photovoltaic properties, and AFM morphology of the homopolymer (P5Se) and the donor–acceptor copolymer (P5SeDTDPP) with a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor were investigated and are discussed. The polymers showed good solubility, film-forming properties, and thermal stabilities. P5Se exhibited a broad absorption across the visible range, 400–700nm, which is a prerequisite for photovoltaic applications. P5SeDTDPP yielded a broader absorption spectrum, enhanced π–π interactions, and a lower band gap compared to P5Se, due to the enhanced intramolecular charge transfer interactions between the donating moiety (pentaselenophene) and the DPP accepting moiety. Solution-processed field effect transistors fabricated from these polymers displayed p-type organic thin film transistor characteristics. P5Se and P5SeDTDPP exhibited typical p-type organic semiconductor characteristics with hole mobilities of 2.3×10−3 and 1.2×10–2cm2V−1s−1, respectively. Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using polymer:PCBM blends in ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/Al structures. The P5SeDTDPP device exhibited an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.44V, a short circuit current (JSC) of 10.67mA/cm2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.51, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.40% under AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) conditions.

Abstract: Titanium oxide (TiOx) was introduced as an electron selective layer between the active layer and bottom electrode in inverted organic solar cells with graphene oxide (GO) an anode interfacial layer. The device with TiOx exhibited a significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency compared to that without TiOx, which indicates that TiOx efficiently blocked holes at the active/bottom layer. This device exhibits good stability over 2160h of storage with only 3.67% reduction in efficiency. The dependence of the device performances on TiOx film thickness was also investigated.

Abstract: We report on the electrochromic properties of transparent one-dimensional nickel oxide (NiO) nanorods grown in a high-density and large-area array. The NiO nanorod array was synthesized on a conducting indium tin oxide thin film via hot-filament metal-oxide vapor deposition (HFMOVD). The array contained ∼100 nanorods per square micrometer, which were ∼500nm long and ∼100nm wide. XRD analysis revealed the 1D NiO nanorods to be in cubic crystalline form within space group Fm3¯m . The outstanding electrochromic properties, including the stable and reversible coloration–bleaching cycles, and large diffusion coefficient (∼6.33×10−8cm2/s), as well as good coloration efficiency (43.3cm2/C), great optical transmittance difference (60%), high optical density (1.06), and very fast coloration and bleaching times (1.55 and 1.22s) at a wavelength of 630nm, make the NiO nanorods excellent materials for use in smart windows.

Abstract: The aluminum (Al) electrode interface in regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) solar cells is probed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. A state-of-the-art TEM sample preparation including in-situ lift-out is carried out using a dual focused ion beam (FIB) on two types of devices—one without annealing and one after annealing at 120°C for 20min. The vertical morphology is studied by crossectional TEM. It is found that upon annealing the thickness of both the Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS and P3HT/PCBM layers decreased significantly from 21±2nm to 16±1nm and 130±2 to 80±1nm, respectively. Through bright field micrographs a mixed layer between the Al electrode and the organic active layer is clearly observed in both methods of device preparations. A nanobeam mode is utilized to collect nanobeam electron diffraction (NBD) pattern in different layers of the device. In the Al layer, discrete diffraction spots from the atomic planes are observed, indicating a single crystal structure of Al. A broad ring diffraction pattern is observed in the P3HT/PCBM layer indicated disorder in the organic layer. A mixture of diffraction spots and an amorphous-like pattern is collected from the mixed region implying diffusion of Al into the organic layer. Elemental mapping results also confirmed that upon annealing Al diffused into the organic layer. Bright field TEM images of annealed devices show a well-contacted interface between Al and the mixed layer as compared to the unannealed devices. The effect of Al contact resistance before and after annealing is studied using the vertical transmission line model (TLM). It is found that by annealing after Al evaporation, the contact resistivity decreased by 38%. The results are consistent with the observation that upon annealing Al atoms diffused into the organic layer and established a mixed region which helps to decrease the contact resistance between the Al electrode and P3HT:PCBM active layer.

Abstract: Tat's transactivating activity is controlled by sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) that connects HIV transcription with the metabolic state of the cell. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a key enzyme in the salvaging pathway for the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) that is involved in energy metabolism. Host encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) may influence viral replication. In this study, our goal was aimed to investigate the regulation of miR-182 in TZM-bl cells and explore the mechanisms by which miR-182 influenced Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation through targeting at down-regulation of NAMPT expression. We showed that miR-182 was up-regulated when Tat was expressed in TZM-bl cells. MiR-182 significantly inhibited NAMPT protein expression by acting on the 3′-UTR of the NAMPT mRNA. MiR-182 was involved in Tat-induced NAD+ depletion, down-regulation of SIRT1 protein expression and activity, increased acetylation of p65. Forced expression of “miR-182 mimics” increased Tat-induced LTR transactivation. Our results uncover previously unknown links between Tat and a specific host cell miRNA that targets NAMPT. Our results suggest that strategies to augment NAMPT protein expression by down-regulation of miR-182 may have therapeutic benefits to prevent HIV-1 replication.

Abstract: Background and objectives
The etiology of favism remains unclear and the fate of favic patients has not previously been studied. Therefore, individuals who had experienced an episode of favism were studied regarding subsequent fava bean ingestion, including the reason for fava bean ingestion after the initial favic attack and any adverse reactions. In addition, a new hypothesis for the etiology of favism is proposed.
Patients and methods
From June 2005 to June 2012, a total of 38 patients with a history of favism were included in this study. Circumstances regarding the initial favic attack were obtained from medical records and patient interviews, and subsequent fava bean ingestion and recurrence of symptoms were investigated.
Results
Three of the 38 patients (7.9%) were female, and 35 (92.1%) were male. The mean age was 27.9years (14–63years). The first attack of favism occurred before 10years of age for 31 patients (81.6%) and in the springtime for 35 patients (92.1%). Thirty-three patients (86.7%) regularly ate fava beans before the attack, and 35 (92.1%) resumed eating fava beans within 1–17years after the attack without symptoms. Two patients (5.2%) experienced a single recurrence of symptoms. No evidence of hemolysis was found in the four patients checked after fava bean re-ingestion.
Conclusions
Patients resumed eating fava bean for various reasons, and the recurrence of symptoms was uncommon. An infectious agent such as a virus may play a role in the development of favism.

Abstract: Clusterin is a stress-responsive and highly glycosylated secretory protein that plays cytoprotective role in most body fluids. In addition to extracellular clusterin, several intracellular clusterin variants that are rather cytotoxic have been recently uncovered under diverse pathological conditions. Although these variants revealed heterogeneity in their glycan modification, its significance in many diseases remains to be validated. Here, we found that clusterin is differentially metabolized by two well-characterized ER stress inducers. Thapsigargin induced retrotranslocation and rapid degradation of clusterin from the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas tunicamycin failed to degrade but rather retained clusterin in the endoplasmic reticulum. Important sorting determinant for these processes proved to be N-glycan moieties that are required for the prevention of terminal misfolding and aggregation of clusterin in the endoplasmic reticulum. This study provides a mechanistic insight into the generation of noble cytotoxic variant of intracellular clusterin and an idea about molecular pathogenesis of diseases associated with chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress, such as neurodegeneration.

Abstract: This paper details the fabrication and properties of CdSe/CdTe thin film photovoltaic devices with a dual back contact geometry. Device fabrication involves CdSe electrodeposition on one of two interdigitated electrodes on a pre-patterned substrate followed by CdTe electrodeposition over the entire structure so that both electrodes are behind the active portion of the device. In contrast to traditional planar devices, illumination is on the electrode-free CdTe surface rather than through a window layer. Like previously detailed back-contact devices for other materials systems, all light that impinges on the device thus reaches the CdTe absorber, the surface being free of metallic electrodes, transparent conductors and window layers. Device efficiency of 2% under simulated air mass 1.5 illumination for feature spacing of 2μm is similar to that of three-dimensionally patterned CdS/CdTe devices detailed by other groups with similar feature height but much smaller 0.5μm spacing.

Abstract: To reduce the thick carbon layer between the Mo back contact and the CuInSe2 (CIS) absorber in non-vacuum-processed CIS solar cells, a hybrid ink was used to form a CuInSe2 (CIS) thin film. The hybrid ink consists of binary nanoparticles (CuS and In–Se) and a precursor solution. Binary nanoparticles were synthesized by a low-temperature colloidal process and acted as stress-relief and crack-deflection centers in the hybrid ink. A precursor solution was prepared with a chelating agent that acted to effectively bind the nanoparticles without other binders. In particular, the use of nanoparticles made it possible to reduce the carbon layer due to the easy removal of organics in the precursor solution through the pores between the nanoparticles. The thickness of the formed CIS layer was 1.22μm, and the thickness ratio of the CIS layer/carbon layer (CIS/carbon) was almost 1. The fabricated device with this thin film showed a reproducible conversion efficiency of 5.87% and a band gap of 1.11eV.

Abstract: Previously, we reported 15.4%-efficient copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS)-based photovoltaic devices from electrodeposited precursor films in which the final film composition was adjusted using the physical vapor deposition (PVD) method. At present, we are fabricating CIGS-based solar cells directly from electrodeposited precursor films, eliminating the expensive PVD step. Electrodeposited CIGS absorber layers are fabricated from a stacked Cu/In/Ga layers. All films are electrodeposited from an aqueous-based solution at room temperature in a two-electrode cell configuration, with platinum gauze as the counter electrode and a glass substrate as the working electrode. The substrate is DC-sputtered with about 1μm of Mo. The electrodeposited films are selenized at high temperature (∼550°C) to obtain 11.7%-efficient device.

Abstract: Mucus hypersecretion is a remarkable pathophysiological manifestation in airway obstructive diseases. These diseases are usually accompanied with elevated shear stress due to bronchoconstriction. Previous studies have reported that shear stress induces mucin5AC (MUC5AC) secretion via actin polymerization in cultured nasal epithelial cells. Furthermore, it is well known that cortactin, an actin binding protein, is a central mediator of actin polymerization. Therefore, we hypothesized that cortactin participates in MUC5AC hypersecretion induced by elevated shear stress via actin polymerization in cultured human airway epithelial cells. Compared with the relevant control groups, Src phosphorylation, cortactin phosphorylation, actin polymerization and MUC5AC secretion were significantly increased after exposure to elevated shear stress. Similar effects were found when pretreating the cells with jasplakinolide, and transfecting with wild-type cortactin. However, these effects were significantly attenuated by pretreating with Src inhibitor, cytochalasin D or transfecting cells with the specific small interfering RNA of cortactin. Collectively, these results suggest that elevated shear stress induces MUC5AC hypersecretion via tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin-associated actin polymerization in cultured human airway epithelial cells.

Abstract: Nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) is considered as a promising photocatalytic material due to its optical absorption extended in the visible region compared to pure TiO2. In the field of photovoltaic applications, dye-sensitized solar cells based on N-doped nanocrystalline titania electrodes have demonstrated improved performance due to the beneficial effects of nitrogen on the electronic and optical properties of TiO2. In this context, we report on the influence of nitrogen doping on the performance of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells, starting from TiO2 and N-TiO2 nanocrystals synthesized by laser pyrolysis. Using an integrated approach based on experimental and theoretical investigations, the relationship between the local electronic features of the starting metal oxide materials and device operation is described. We demonstrate that the short-circuit current density of the solar cells based on an N-doped TiO2 electrode increases by more than 10% compared to that of pure anatase. This improvement is clearly associated with the extended absorption of the doped electrode, suggesting that alternative charge generation mechanisms occur in the cells in addition to the conventional dye absorption. Computer simulations on isolated nanoclusters, as well as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, confirm that nitrogen atoms in the presence of oxygen vacancies can explain the introduction of additional energy states near the valence band of TiO2. Surface states associated with nitroxide radicals are also suggested to act as charge traps under illumination. These aspects confirm the strong potentialities of optically-active metal oxides for photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: Creatine kinase plays a key role in the energy homeostasis of vertebrate cells. Creatine kinase B (CKB), a cytosolic isoform of creatine kinase, shows upregulated expression in a variety of cancers. In this research, we confirmed that some ovarian cancer tissues had elevated CKB expression at the protein level. The functions of CKB in ovarian cancer progression were investigated in the ovarian cancer cell line Skov3, which has a high CKB expression. It was found that CKB knockdown inhibited Skov3 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis under hypoxia or hypoglycemia conditions. CKB depletion also sensitized Skov3 to chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, the CKB knockdown reduced glucose consumption and lactate production, and increased ROS production and oxygen consumption. This suggested that CKB knockdown decreased cytosolic glycolysis and resulted in a tumor suppressive metabolic state in Skov3 cells. Consequently, we found that the knockdown of CKB induced G2 arrest in cell cycle by elevating p21 expression and affected the PI3K/Akt and AMPK pathways. These findings provide new insights in the role of CKB in cancer cell survival and tumor progression. Our results also suggest that CKB depletion/inhibition in combination with chemotherapeutic agents might have synergistic effects in ovarian cancer therapy.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (CaP) is the second leading malignancy in men. The role of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), also known as CD326, in CaP progression and therapeutic resistance is still uncertain. Here, we aimed to investigate the roles of EpCAM in CaP metastasis and chemo/radioresistance. Expression of EpCAM in CaP cell lines and human CaP tissues was assessed using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, respectively. EpCAM was knocked down (KD) in PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP-C4-2B cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA), and KD results were confirmed by confocal microscope, Western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell growth was evaluated by proliferation and colony formation assays. The invasive potential was assessed using a matrigel chamber assay. Tumorigenesis potential was measured by a sphere formation assay. Chemo-/radiosensitivity were measured using a colony formation assay. Over-expression of EpCAM was found in primary CaP tissues and lymph node metastases including cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells. KD of EpCAM suppressed CaP proliferation and invasive ability, reduced sphere formation, enhanced chemo-/radiosensitivity, and down-regulated E-cadherin, p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-4EBP1 and p-S6K expression in CaP cells. Our findings suggest that EpCAM plays an important role in CaP proliferation, invasion, metastasis and chemo-/radioresistance associated with the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and is a novel therapeutic target to sensitize CaP cells to chemo-/radiotherapy.

Abstract: The form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) with fatty acid eutectics absorbed in and/or supported by the overlaid mats of electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers or the derived carbon nanofibers were explored for storage and retrieval of thermal energy. The carbon mats were made from the PAN mats through stabilization in air followed by carbonization in nitrogen. Three fatty acid eutectics of capric acid–lauric acid, capric acid–palmitic acid, and capric acid–stearic acid were studied as model PCMs; for comparison, the individual fatty acid of capric acid was also studied. The results indicated that electrospun nanofibrous mats were highly porous and capable of absorbing a large amount of PCMs, and the maximum absorption capacities of PAN and carbon mats were ∼99wt% and ∼81wt%, respectively. The composite materials (i.e., the form-stable PCMs) could well-retain their overall shapes when the PCMs were in the molten stage; i.e., they would not flow/leak from the mats. The conversion of PAN mats into carbon mats increased the thermal energy storage/retrieval rates of the resulting composite PCMs; nonetheless, the thermal treatments of stabilization and carbonization also made the mats to be less fluffy, leading to the reduction of absorption amount. Morphological structures, as well as the properties of thermal energy storage, absorption capacity, and thermal energy storage/retrieval rates, of electrospun nanofibrous mats and the resulting composite PCMs were studied by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and measurement of melting/freezing times. The results indicated that the melting temperatures and enthalpies of the prepared composite PCMs were in the range of 19.8–31.4°C and 120.1–165.4kJ/kg for PAN mats, and 18.8–30.7°C and 92.1–128.0kJ/kg for carbon mats, respectively. In comparison with melting times of CA–PA/PAN and freezing times of CA–SA/PAN, the melting times of CA–PA/carbon and freezing times of CA–SA/carbon were shortened by about 49.5% and 41.0%, respectively. It is envisioned that this innovative type of form-stable PCMs could be utilized for potential applications in building energy conservation.

Abstract: Neuroblastoma (NB) is characterized by pleomorphic molecular characteristics, which may influence cellular metabolism as well as the efficacy of glycolytic inhibitors in suppressing NB cell growth. We studied the metabolic profile of four NB cell lines without or with MYCN amplification and found no unanimous metabolic characteristics. The two NB cell lines with MYCN amplification exhibited a significantly higher HIF-1α expression level and ATP content compared to the two cell lines without MYCN amplification. MYCN amplification was associated with significantly greater inhibition of cellular proliferation and more apoptosis after treatment with the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). Further analysis showed that 2DG increased PDK1 but decreased the ATP content and increased expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bad in both SK-N-AS (without MYCN amplification) and SK-N-DZ (with MYCN amplification) cells. In addition, 2DG decreased hexokinase II expression in SK-N-DZ cells and increased HIF-1α, Noxa, and PUMA expression in SK-N-AS cells. Pretreating SK-N-DZ cells with 2DG or cisplatin for 24h, followed by cisplatin or 2DG for another 24h, resulted in significantly greater suppression of cellular proliferation compared to treatment with 2DG or cisplatin for 48h alone. Effective suppression of SK-N-AS proliferation occurred only when the cells were pretreated with cisplatin. Pretreatment of SK-N-DZ, but not SK-N-AS, with 2DG followed by the BH3-only mimetic ABT737 also resulted in significantly greater suppression of cellular proliferation compared to treatment with ABT737 or 2DG alone. A low dose of 2DG (2mM) was as effective as a high dose (20mM) in SK-N-DZ cells. In conclusion, the glycolytic inhibitor 2DG complemented the cisplatin- or ABT737-induced suppression of growth in NB cells, which are sensitive to glycolytic inhibition.

Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterised by an elevated capacity for tumour invasion and lymph node metastasis and the cause remains to be determined. Recent studies suggest that microRNAs can regulate the evolution of malignant behaviours by regulating multiple target genes. In this study, we have first confirmed that miR-363 is down-regulated in HNSCC tissues with lymph node metastasis and cell lines with highly invasive capacity. We used bioinformatics, cellular and molecular methods to predict and prove that miR-363 directly targeted to podoplanin (PDPN) and caused up-regulation of PDPN in HNSCC. MSP assay showed that DNA promoter methylation was involved in silencing the miR-363 in HNSCC. Furthermore, we provided evidence to demonstrate that PDPN dysregulation caused by down-regulation of miR-363 contributes to HNSCC invasion and metastasis. These data reveal a key role of miR-363-PDPN in HNSCC metastasis and support biological and clinical links between miR-363-PDPN and HNSCC.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 potentiates glucotoxicity-diminished insulin secretion via stimulation of cAMP-PKA signaling in INS-1E cells and mouse islets,

Abstract: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-enhanced insulin secretion is mainly mediated by cAMP-PKA and cAMP-Epac2 signaling pathways at physiological glucose concentrations. However the cellular mechanisms underlying the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 at glucotoxicity remain largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the effects of GLP-1 on glucotoxicity-diminished insulin secretion and explored the roles of these two cAMP-linked pathways in mediating the effects of GLP-1 under glucotoxic conditions. Consistent with the previous reports, exposure of INS-1E cells and mouse islets to 30mM glucose for 72h almost abolished glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Addition of 10nM GLP-1 significantly increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This was not due to a protective effect of GLP-1 against glucotoxicity-induced apoptosis but instead improvement of the secretory capacity of the insulin-secreting β-cells. It is of note that GLP-1 preferentially increased the expression and activity of PKA, whereas had no effects on Epac2 at high glucose. In correlation with the observations, treatment of INS-1E cells with the specific PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS completely abolished the insulinotropic action of GLP-1, whereas knock-down of Epac2 did not interfere the effects of GLP-1. Moreover, GLP-1 did not increase further insulin secretion in the presence of the PKA agonist 6-Bnz-cAMP-AM. By contrast, it produced additional enhancement of insulin secretion when Epac2 was maximally stimulated by its selective agonist 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM. Taken together, our results suggest that GLP-1 potentiates glucotoxicity-diminished insulin secretion mainly through cAMP-PKA signaling pathway.

Abstract: Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), together with its major downstream effector p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), has been identified a central role in cellular events such as cell cytoskeletal remodeling that contributed to cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). And there are data implicating that podocytes underwent EMT under pathological conditions. However, little is known about mechanisms of podocytes undergoing EMT. To address this, we assessed the cellular changes of podocytes after high glucose stimulation in vitro, detected the effects of Rac1/PAK1 signaling on podocytes in response to the stimuli, and investigated interactions of Rac1/PAK1 axis with β-catenin and Snail under high glucose conditions. We found that in vitro high glucose treatment led to remarkable down-regulation of nephrin and P-cadherin, as well as significant up-regulation of α-SMA and FSP-1, suggesting that in the presence of high glucose, podocytes underwent EMT, during which Rac1/PAK1 signaling was activated. And these were notably ameliorated by Rac1 gene knockdown. Furthermore, β-catenin and Snail nuclear translocation were triggered by Rac1/PAK1 axis, which were both markedly reversed via Rac1 gene knockdown or pretreatment of IPA-3, a PAK1 inhibitor. These findings elaborated that Rac1/PAK1 signaling contributed to high glucose-induced podocyte EMT via promoting β-catenin and Snail transcriptional activities, which could be a potential mechanism involved in podocytes injury in response to stimuli under diabetic conditions.

Abstract: A transparent electrode consists of nanoporous silver thin film and molybdenum oxide was developed for transparent anode with advantages of low cost, large-area processing and room-temperature fabrication. High density nanoporous silver film was fabricated by controlling thickness and deposition rate during thermal evaporation. With silver thickness of 10nm and 5Å/s deposition rate, the MoOx/nanoporous Ag/MoOx multilayer structure achieved ~9Ω/sq sheet resistance and ~70% transparency. Compared to the indium—tin-oxide (ITO) anode, the nanoporous anode/SubPc/C60/BCP/Al photovoltaic device has an enhanced surface-plasmon absorption and a higher fill factor. Although its transparency is lower than ITO, the nanoporous anode achieved 3.45% power conversion efficiency, comparable to ITO-based devices.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated previously by us that cyclin D1 and ClC-3 play important roles in regulation of the cell cycle in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. The action of cyclin D1 on the functional activities and expression of chloride channels were investigated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE-2Z cells in this study. The results indicated that enhanced cyclin D1 expression increased the activation of volume-activated chloride currents and promoted the expression of ClC-3 chloride channel proteins. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments demonstrated that the distance between cyclin D1 and ClC-3 was less than 10nm, and there existed interaction between the two proteins. ClC-3 was partially colocalized with cyclin D1 and CDK4/6. Dialyzing CDK4 antibodies into cells via recording pipettes activated a chloride current, but dialysis of CDK6 antibodies inhibited basal and volume-activated Cl− currents. The CDK4/6 inhibitor fascaplysin chloride hydrate (highly selective for CDK4/cyclin D1 with IC50=0.35μM and less selective for CDK6/D1 with IC50=3.4μM) activated a chloride current in low concentration, but did not show significantly facilitative effects on the current in high concentration. In conclusion, our data suggest that the ClC-3 chloride channel is an important target of cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 may regulate the functional activities of the chloride channel via CDK4 and CDK6, and/or the expression of the chloride channel. Cyclin D1–CDK4 complexes may phosphorylate chloride channels resulting in inhibition or inactivation of the channels, and cyclin D1–CDK6 complexes may facilitate the activation of chloride channels.

Abstract: A selective near-infrared absorbing heptamethine cyanine dye (Cy7-P) electron donor was used for the fabrication of bilayer solar cells with the acceptor C60. Using a reflective metal top electrode, solar cell optimization resulted in an external power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.5% for layer thicknesses of ~20nm for Cy7-P and of ~40nm for C60, with using either PEDOT:PSS or MoO3 as anode and Alq3 as cathode buffer layers. Highly transparent devices were then fabricated by using silver/Alq3 cathodes. Average visible transmittance (450–670nm) values of, for example, 67.2% (η=0.7%), 62.1% (η=0.9%) or 50% (η=1%) were obtained for different thickness combinations of silver and Alq3. Optimized solar cells had a maximum transparency of 79.8% at 568nm. The operational stability under 1sun illumination was T80=30h, after which 80% of the initial cell performance was reached.

Abstract: Two regioselective C60(OCH3)4 derivatives, C60(OCH3)4-PCBM (a methanofullerene derivative of C60(OCH3)4, PCBM=[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) and C60(OCH3)4-APCBM (an aziridinofullerene derivative of C60(OCH3)4) were synthesized from C60Cl6 and used as acceptor for polymer solar cells. Revealed by cyclic voltammetry, the LUMO energy levels of C60(OCH3)4-APCBM and C60(OCH3)4-PCBM are 0.2 and 0.3eV higher than that of PCBM, respectively. For the polymer photovoltaic cells with fullerene (PCBM, C60(OCH3)4-APCBM or C60(OCH3)4-PCBM) acceptor in combination with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) donor, the open-circuit voltage is increased from 0.58V (for PCBM) to 0.63V (for C60(OCH3)4-APCBM) and 0.72V (for C60(OCH3)4-PCBM). The higher open-circuit voltages are reasonably attributed to the higher LUMO levels of the C60(OCH3)4 derivatives because of four electron-donating methoxy groups attached. The photovoltaic performance of C60(OCH3)4-PCBM-based device is higher than that involving C60(OCH3)4-APCBM, largely due to the structural changeability of C60(OCH3)4-APCBM resulting from the rotatable N–C bond bridge therein. This work demonstrates that fullerene derivatives with higher LUMO level can be functionalized from multi-addition of electron-donating groups, and exemplifies that photovoltaic performances of fullerene-based solar cells are sensitive even to trivial bridge between functional group and fullerene core.

Abstract: We synthesized silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with particle sizes ∼6nm, and also investigated the effect of Ag NPs on the performance of polymer solar cells. It is seen that Ag NPs improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT) solar cells. PCE increased from 0.65 to 1.72 with incorporation of Ag NPs. Hole and electron recombination time (τn) was calculated with impedance spectroscopy as 0.4ms for PCDTBT solar cells with nanoparticles and 1.26ms for PCDTBT solar cells without nanoparticles.

Abstract: The interconnection of solar cells is one of the main process steps in photovoltaic module production. Usually solar cells are connected into strings by soldering. Due to cell thickness reduction and substantial changes of solar cell metallization, alternative interconnection techniques are required. The thermomechanically induced stress, caused by high soldering temperature and different coefficients of thermal expansion limits the long term reliability of the modules. The use of conductive adhesive enables the reduction of this thermomechanically induced stress significantly. Furthermore, conductive adhesive enables interconnection of new cells and interconnector concepts, such as heterojunction solar cells with their heat sensitive surface. Relatively costly silver (Ag) based conductive adhesives are commercially available. For cost reduction and for increase in long-term reliability reasons a carbon nanotube (CNT) based conductive adhesive has been produced and investigated. Single cell modules have been built using CNT and Ag based conductive adhesives and compared. Electroluminescence, power measurement, and contact resistance measurement among other tools have been used for evaluation.

Abstract: A primary optics for solar concentrator made of an achromatic Fresnel doublet has been designed and manufactured. The achromatic Fresnel doublet combines the advantages of plastic lenses without being affected by chromatic aberrations. The performance has been determined experimentally using a homemade continuous solar simulator and compared to paraxial theory and ray-tracing simulations. Experimental results are in good agreement with theory and show that the achromatic Fresnel doublet is tolerant to manufacturing errors and uncertainty on the dispersion of the refractive index: the concentration factor remains above 1600× with an f-number of 2.

Enhanced mesenchymal stem cell survival induced by GATA-4 overexpression is partially mediated by regulation of the miR-15 family,

Abstract: We reported previously that pre-programming mesenchymal stem cells with the GATA-4 gene increases significantly cell survival in an ischemic environment. In this study, we tested whether regulation of microRNAs and their target proteins was associated with the cytoprotective effects of GATA-4.
Methods and results
Mesenchymal stem cells were harvested from adult rat bone marrow and transduced with GATA-4 (MSCGATA-4) using the murine stem cell virus retroviral expression system. Cells transfected with empty vector (MSCNull) were used as controls. Quantitative real-time PCR data showed that the expression levels of miR-15 family members (miR-15b, miR-16, and miR-195) were significantly down-regulated in MSCGATA-4. The protein expression of Bcl-w (Bcl-2-like-2), an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, was increased in MSCGATA-4. Hypoxic culture (low glucose and low oxygen) induced the release of lactate dehydrogenase from mesenchymal stem cells and reduced cell survival. Compared to MSCNull, MSCGATA-4 showed less lactate dehydrogenase release and greater cell survival following 72h hypoxia exposure. The mitochondrial membrane potential, detected with the dye JC-1, was well maintained, and mitochondrial membrane permeability, expressed as caspase 3 and 7 activities in response to the ischemic environment was lower in MSCGATA-4. Moreover, transfection with miR-195 significantly down-regulated Bcl-w expression in mesenchymal stem cells through a binding site in the 3′-UTR of the Bcl-w mRNA and reduced mesenchymal stem cell resistance to ischemic injury.
Conclusions
The overexpression of GATA-4 in mesenchymal stem cells down-regulates miR-15 family members, causing increased resistance to ischemia through the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins in the Bcl-2 family.

Abstract: To fabricate efficient solar cells, it is crucial to control the nanoscale morphology of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) film, in which the thermal and morphological stability is an important issue. In this article, aqueous-solution-processed hybrid photovoltaic devices from poly(1,4-naphthalene vinylene) (PNV) and CdTe nanocrystals (NCs) are fabricated and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.74% under AM1.5G illumination is achieved. Furthermore, we demonstrate the high thermal stability of hybrid solar cells by investigating the evolution of hybrid films with prolonged annealing time and elevated temperature. Thermal annealing is necessary for converting PNV precursor to PNV and removing the ligands on CdTe NCs, which leads to the improvement of device performance. In particular, the prolonged annealing time and elevated temperature do not lower the PCE, because the interconnected CdTe networks are highly rigid and thereby suppress the excess phase separation of PNV, which is one of the main issues determining the long-term stability of polymer-based photovoltaic devices. This advantage is considered to promote the development of hybrid solar cells from various aqueous-solution-processed polymers and NCs.

Abstract: The silver nanosheets (AgNSs) prepared via normal silver mirror reaction were used to improve the performance of organic solar cells. AgNSs with a size of about 100nm in width and 10nm in thickness formed a 3-D network on an indium tin oxide (ITO) surface. Organic solar cells with a structure of ITO/AgNSs/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/poly(3-hexylthiophene) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM)/LiF/Al exhibited an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.60±0.01V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.16±0.08mA/cm2, a fill factor (FF) of 53.69±0.92%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.60±0.06%. The PCEs of organic solar cells with 3-D AgNSs layers were 1.29 times that of the control device without 3-D AgNSs layer. We attributed the improvement of the efficiency to localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced by the 3-D network of AgNSs, which enhanced the light harvest of active layers, increased the probability of exciton generation and dissociation.

Abstract: Aggregated amyloid-β causes pathological changes in mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes such as sporadic cytoplasmic intracellular Ca2+-signalling, increase in reactive oxygen species production and cell death. Some of the toxic effects of amyloid-β are mediated through the interaction of the peptide with α7-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the cell surface. Here we demonstrated that affinity purified antibodies to synthetic fragment 173–193 of the α7-subunit of the nAChR are able to protect cells from amyloid-β induced cell death. The antibodies had no effect on the amyloid-β induced calcium signal in astrocytes. However, they significantly reduced amyloid-β induced and NADPH oxidase mediated ROS production. Modulation of the NADPH oxidase activity by either the antibodies, the receptor agonist acetylcholine or the antagonist of the α7-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors α-bungarotoxin was vital in inhibiting both amyloid-β induced ROS production, caspase 3 cleavage as well as cell death. The uncovered details of the mechanism underlying the action of antibodies to α7-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors gives additional insight into the involvement of this receptor in Alzheimer's disease pathology and provides a new approach to anti-Alzheimer's disease vaccine design.

ONTD induces apoptosis of human hepatoma Bel-7402 cells via a MAPK-dependent mitochondrial pathway and the depletion of intracellular glutathione,

Abstract: 3-Oxo-29-noroleana-1,9(11),12-trien-2,20-dicarbonitrile (ONTD) is a novel synthetic derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), which has the ability to inhibit the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. However, the mechanisms by which ONTD exerts its inhibitory effects remain elusive. The present study was conducted to investigate the cytotoxicity of ONTD in Bel-7402 cells and its molecular mechanisms. We found that ONTD depleted intracellular GSH, increased the level of ROS, and consequently induced mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) leading to the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c (Cyt c) to the cytosol. Mitochondrial alteration and subsequent apoptotic cell death in ONTD-treated Bel-7402 cells could be blocked by addition of exogenous antioxidants N-acetylcystein (NAC), GSH and the MTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA). In addition, ONTD activated the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) but not extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK 1/2). When the cells were exposed to SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor), the deregulation of the expression of apoptotic proteins was attenuated. Furthermore, 40mg/kg ONTD significantly reduced tumor weight (−70.62%, p<0.01) in the H22 tumor-bearing mouse model in vivo. Taken together, these findings provide the first experimental evidence supporting that ONTD could induce apoptosis of Bel-7402 cells via MAPK-mediated mitochondrial pathway and ONTD has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of HCC.

Abstract: We present a soft method for the fabrication of well controlled plasmonic nanodots on large ITO substrate for organic solar cells. Masks of nanopatterned aluminum oxide are elaborated and deposited on ITO substrates before metal deposition. After removal of the mask, well organized and isolated metallic nanodots are observed. In this article, we focus on gold or silver nanostructures: they show a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) in the visible region, an important feature for their integration in organic thin film solar cells and the final improvement of the optical properties of the cell. In addition, their near field enhancement capacity is also clearly demonstrated by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and FDTD method simulation. An additional advantage of this protocol is that it can be used on any kind of surface and with different metals, depending on the final application.

Abstract: P3HT:PCBM blends applied as active layers for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells generally show unstable morphologies upon prolonged thermal annealing, severely limiting the lifetime of the devices. As such, the thermodynamic instability of the blend is a limiting factor in the overall performance of organic photovoltaics, and a strong disadvantage in the fierce competition with other photovoltaic technologies. This paper shows whether different blend preparation conditions and intrinsic structural changes in the side chains of poly(3-alkylthiophene) (P3AT) derivatives can influence the thermal stability of the resulting solar cells. A combination of Bright Field Transmission Electron Microscopy (BFTEM) and the analysis of Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) patterns revealed that the investigated preparation conditions do not really affect the thermal stability, whereas the introduction of a small ratio (10%) of specific functional moieties in the side chains of random P3AT copolymers does improve the thermal stability significantly. It was demonstrated that demixing of the blend components upon prolonged thermal annealing is strongly delayed in the functionalized P3AT:PCBM blends. The enhanced thermal stability was confirmed by in-situ monitoring of the short circuit current of organic solar cells based on the respective active layers. The introduction of functionalized side chains hence represents an attractive approach to increase the operational stability of organic photovoltaics based on the bulk heterojunction concept.

Abstract: Fabrication of large-area anti-reflective coatings (ARCs) on glass substrates by using a cost-efficient and simple approach, especially for applications in photovoltaics, remains a challenge. This study proposes electrospinning as a technique to fabricate porous SiO2 ARCs on large-area glass substrates (20×20cm2). The existing electrospinning setup is modified to enable large-area glass coatings and electrospinning process parameters are optimized to achieve sub-wavelength ARCs. The post-sintered SiO2 ARC is thoroughly characterized for the film morphology and optical properties. The transmittance for one-side and both-sides coated glass is found to be 94.3% and 96% respectively. The anti-reflective glass is incorporated in solar modules to determine the increase in short circuit current. The increase in short-circuit current is found to be 3%. Electrospinning as a fabrication technique has potential in offering a cost effective solution for synthesizing ARCs on large-area substrates for photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: Tec family kinases play critical roles in the activation of immune cells. In particular, Itk is important for the activation of T cells via the T cell Receptor (TcR), however, molecules that cooperate with Itk to activate downstream targets remain little explored. Here we show that Itk interacts with the heterotrimeric G-protein α subunit Gα13 during TcR triggering. This interaction requires membrane localization of both partners, and is partially dependent on GDP- and GTP-bound states of Gα13. Furthermore, we find that Itk interacts with Gα13 via the zinc binding regions within its Tec homology domain. The interaction between Itk and Gα13 also results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Gα13, however this is not required for the interaction. Itk enhances Gα13 mediated activation of serum response factor (SRF) transcriptional activity dependent on its ability to interact with Gα13, but its kinase activity is not required to enhance SRF activity. These data reveal a new pathway regulated by Itk in cells, and suggest cross talk between Itk and G-protein signaling downstream of the TcR.

Abstract: This paper describes inverted bulk heterojunction organic solar cells featuring solution-processed zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) as an electron extraction layer, prepared at relatively low annealing temperatures (≤150°C). A solution of ZnO NPs (average size: 25nm) was prepared using a wet grinding method. When the ZnO interlayer was present in the solar cell, the vertical phase separation of the active layers prepared with and without solvent annealing exhibited similar gradient concentrations and, therefore, similar photocurrent generation, both of which were superior to those of conventional devices incorporating a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) hole extraction layer. We attribute this vertical phase separation to the similar surface energies of the fullerene derivative and the ZnO interlayer. Under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5G illumination at 100mWcm−2, the power conversion efficiency of the optimized device was approximately 4%.

Abstract: We report evidence for the identification of the capacitance transients detected at room temperature for thin-film photovoltaic cells with CIGS absorbers as an additional non-ohmic contact in the structure with a time constant larger than that of the solar cell p–n junction. The N1 signal was recently interpreted as a back contact barrier for which the RC-like time constant is smaller than the time constant of the junction. In this work we unite these experimental observations in one model. Since for a Mo/CIGS/CdS/ZnO solar cell several interfaces are connected in series, we introduce the idea of modeling capacitance spectroscopy signals based on RC-circuits in series for each interface. It is shown that the distinct features observed in capacitance spectroscopy of CIGS solar cells can be mimicked using this circuit as an electrical model. The differential equation for this structure as a function of time is solved numerically. It is inherent to the model that the transients in such a structure are voltage transients over each of the interfaces and that the transients are coupled. These findings question the practical use of capacitance spectroscopy for direct measurement of defects in the absorber layer.

Abstract: This paper addresses a major issue related to the use of upgraded-metallurgical grade silicon for n-type solar cells. We show that n-type silicon ingots, grown from silicon feedstock containing both boron and phosphorus, display a vertical net doping variation which is incompatible with high-yield production of high-efficiency solar cells. As a solution, we propose to use compensation engineering, by means of gallium co-doping, and demonstrate its potential to control the net doping along the ingot height. The resulting material exhibits high minority carrier diffusion length gratefully to compensation but degrades upon illumination due to the activation of the boron–oxygen defect. This latter degradation remains an important though not unsurmountable challenge for making high-efficiency n-type solar cells with upgraded-metallurgical grade silicon.

Abstract: The physicochemical properties of two newly developed dirt-resistant cool white coatings were systematically measured in light of the relevant standard testing methods, and the influences of dirt accumulation and washing on the long-term cooling performance of cool coatings were investigated and discussed. Both cool white coatings owe their outstanding physicochemical properties to the optimized formulations, high glass transition temperature and minimum film formation temperature of selected aqueous self-curing acrylic emulsions. The high solid content was also influential. Dirt accumulation leads to a decline in the cooling performance of coatings, which may be almost fully restored by simply washing the coatings with a mild soap solution.

Abstract: Thin-film polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) solar cell technology tries to combine the cost benefit of thin-film technology and the quality potential of crystalline Si technology. For this type of solar cells the challenge is to fabricate high quality coarse-grained (grain size of 1–100µm) layers on non-silicon substrates in combination with superb light management. One possible material fabrication approach is metal induced crystallization (MIC). Many metals lower the crystallization temperature of a-Si but for photovoltaic (PV) solar cell applications aluminum seems to be the most interesting. Approximately a decade after the suggestion of Nast et al. to use aluminum induced layer exchange for thin-film solar cells, this paper will discuss the aluminum induced crystallization process itself as well as the implementation into workable solar cells. The record aluminum induced crystallization (AIC) solar cell today features an energy conversion efficiency of 8.5%, too low to be competitive with other PV technologies. The main problems and limitations as encountered today will be described. We believe that an energy conversion efficiency of 8.5% is not the limit of AIC solar cells. Different possible solutions to improve the AIC process as well as the resulting solar cells will be discussed together with our vision on the direction and future of AIC solar cell research.

Abstract: The influence of the interface morphologies on amorphous silicon thin-film solar cells prepared on randomly textured substrates was studied. A simple three-dimensional geometrical model was developed to describe the surface morphology of amorphous silicon films and thin-film solar cells. The simulated surface morphologies are confirmed by experimental measurements. A detailed understanding of the interface morphologies is required to gain insights in the light-trapping of silicon thin-film solar cells on randomly textured substrates and derive strategies to improve the light-trapping properties. The morphology of amorphous silicon solar cell layers is calculated by using atomic force microscope scans of the randomly textured substrates and the thickness of layers as input data. The influence of the interface morphologies on the surface roughness, average film thickness and size of surface textures is investigated. Finally the influence of these parameters on the light-trapping and optical losses is discussed.

Abstract: A new series of fullerene (C60) multiadducts of methyl ester substituted thieno-o-quinodimethane were synthesized for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The synthesized 5-methyl ester thieno-o-quinodimethane fullerene (C60) multiple adducts, such as METFMA (mono-adduct), METFBA (bis-adduct) and METFTA (tris-adduct), showed good solubility in toluene, CHCl3 and ODCB. Their molecular structures were confirmed by 1H, 13C NMR, UV–visible spectroscopy, DSC, TGA and HRMS Cyclic voltammetry revealing a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of −3.65eV for METFMA, −3.53eV for METFBA and −3.42eV for METFTA, which is higher than that of PC61BM. The higher LUMO energy level of METFMA, METFBA and METFTA resulted in an enhancement of the open-circuit voltages (Voc) of PSCs. Device of the multiple adduct acceptors was blended with a P3HT donor with the configuration, ITO/PEDOT/P3HT:acceptor/LiF/Al, using METFMA, METFBA, METFTA and PC61BM as the electron acceptor. The optimal photovoltaic performances were achieved using METFBA and METFTA with power conversion efficiencies of 3.00% and 2.93%, respectively. These results were comparable to the device conducted with P3HT:PC61BM (3.42%) under the same conditions.

Abstract: Polymer solar cell (PSC) with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Bphen/Ag was fabricated using spray coating method, and the influence of in situ annealing treatment on the PSC performance was studied. Comparing the performance of in situ annealed PSC with that of conventional post-annealed cell, the results showed that the in situ annealing treatment at low temperature not only corresponding to 12% enhancement of fill factor, but also resulting in 13% increase of open circuit voltage. The interpenetrating networks of P3HT:PCBM film were characterized by X-ray diffraction, and surface morphologies have been studied by atomic force microscope. The performance enhancement of PSC was attributed to the improved hole mobility of P3HT:PCBM blend and the increased interaction of active layer.

Abstract: Unencapsulated small molecular solar cells with a layer of carboxylated copper phthalocyanine (CuPc⁎) introduced between the donor copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and acceptor 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDI), and using ITO and Ag as the cathode and anode were investigated for 35 days. The performance and stability were compared between traditional ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CuPc/PTCDI/Ag cells and the new ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CuPc/CuPc*/PTCDI/Ag cells. The comparison shows that the modified cell has an enhanced stability compared to traditional cells. The improvement of the lifetime is likely due to the CuPc* layer working as buffer layer to prevent humidity and oxygen from diffusing into the active layer. Different thicknesses of CuPc were investigated to study the effects of CuPc layer thickness on the electrical properties of these devices. It was found that the properties of the cell with 20nm thickness of CuPc were the best.

Abstract: Ultra-thin WO3 nanorods (NRs) embedded polyaniline (PANI) composite thin films were synthesized by embedding WO3 NRs into polyaniline using a surface-initiated-polymerization method, followed by spin-coating deposition. The ultra-thin WO3 NRs with length of 60nm and diameter of 4nm were prepared by a solvothermal method. The nanofillers were well-dispersed in the polymer matrix. The nanocomposites were finally deposited onto ITO-coated glass via spin-coating technology. The electrochromic contrast, switching speed, and durability of the composite films were investigated in details. The composite film, being a dual electrochromic material, varied from purple to green, light yellow and finally dark blue. The switching speed (0.9s) is much faster than the films only composed of WO3 NRs. The durability of the hybrid film was enhanced compared with neat WO3 NRs film.

Abstract: With crystalline silicon technology around in commercial products for over 30 years and still dominating the PV market for the foreseeable future, it is important to consider how this technology can be improved to cope with the increasing demand for lower cost. This paper builds on a concept proposed by imec, integrated-interconnect-module (i2-module), to merge current crystalline silicon cell and module technology with module-level thin-film technology. It investigates, in particular, how hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers can be deposited on wafers that are bonded to a glass superstrate, to provide a low-temperature (heterojunction) approach for passivation and emitter formation in this concept. First, the concept is introduced, together with its context and motivation for a-Si:H heterojunctions. Then, the experiments are described. Starting from screening trials on temporarily and permanently bonded wafers, the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) a-Si:H deposition process is optimized by shielding the adhesive from the plasma, resulting in comparable surface passivation quality between bonded samples and standalone wafers. Finally, first attempts toward integration into solar cell devices are reported, resulting into efficiencies above 18%.

Abstract: A number of ligands with affinities for the heme binding site of apomyoglobin were tested to control amorphous and fibrillar aggregation in the protein. Several techniques, including fluorescence, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, dot blot analysis combined with viability studies were employed for structural characterization and cytotoxicity assessment of the intermediate and final protein structures formed during the aggregation process. Of the small molecules investigated, chrysin and Nile red with high structural similarities to heme were chosen for further studies. Only fibril formation was found to be prevented by Nile red, while chrysin, with a greater structural flexibility, was able to prevent both types of aggregate formation. The two ligands were found to influence aggregation at different stages of intermediate structure formation, an ability determined by their degrees of similarities with heme. Based on structural characterization and toxicity studies, it is concluded that ligands similar in structure to heme may be effective in influencing various stages of aggregate formation and toxicity potencies of the protein structures. Since metalloproteins constitute more than thirty percent of all known proteins, it is concluded that the present strategy may be of general significance.

Abstract: The quantum efficiency and short circuit current of microcrystalline silicon single junction and micromorph tandem solar cells significantly depend on the morphology of the metal back contact. Textured metal back reflectors improve light scattering and diffraction, but also increase optical losses in the back contact of the solar cells. The back contact morphology of microcrystalline silicon solar cell in superstate configuration is determined by the morphology of the textured front substrate and the texture introduced by the growth of the microcrystalline silicon film. A comparison of experimental data and optical simulations reveals that the optical losses associated with the metal back reflector are mainly determined by nano-features present at the metal reflector interface. The textures of the front substrate which propagate to the metal back reflector have only a minor influence on the optical losses. Different strategies will be presented on how to maximize the light trapping properties of the metal back reflector while minimizing the optical losses.

Abstract: We suggest a design guideline that optimally combines light absorptance and electrical performance in silicon nanowire (SiNW) solar cells. The design was experimentally developed using a tradeoff relation between wire length and space-filling ratio. Increasing (or decreasing) the wire length decreases (or increases) the wire filling ratio required to achieve the same amount of light absorption. The superior antireflection characteristics of SiNW arrays stem from optical impedance matching. A wire length of 1.2μm suppressed light reflection enough to obtain 99% absorptance at a filling ratio of 38%. A short length (∼500nm) design using nanopillars rather than nanowires effectively diminished the surface and bulk recombinations to achieve a short circuit current of ∼30mA/cm2 while maintaining good light absorptance.

Abstract: The performance of sputtered CdS/CdTe solar cells with MoO3−x/Au contacts was examined. The cells were fabricated on Pilkington SnO2:F-coated soda-lime glass with a high resistivity transparent SnO2 buffer layer. The MoO3-x/Au back contact layers were deposited by thermal evaporation. The incorporation of the MoO3−x layer was found to improve the open circuit voltage (VOC) but reduce the fill factor (FF) of the sputtered CdS/CdTe cells. While VOC is not sensitive to the thickness of the MoO3 layer, FF is very sensitive. The optimal thickness for the MoO3 layer is found to be 2–5nm, which yields nearly 12% efficiency. The performance of these CdS/CdTe solar cells was further evaluated under thermal stress at 200°C in controlled environments. We found that the cells degraded significantly under thermal stress in air, due to the increase of series resistance or decrease of FF.

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes/Prussian blue (CNT/PB) films were prepared and tested as electrodes for electrochemical devices. The thicknesses (and transmittances) of the different films were controlled through the amount of both CNTs and PB. The electrochromic behavior of the films was compared to a PB film electro-synthesized by the classical route, showing improvement in several parameters, mainly the stability towards electrochemical cycles. The five different CNT/PB films presented Coulombic efficiency between 91 and 94%, coloration efficiency between 61.1 and 138.6cm2C−1, response time between 1.1 and 3.2s and oxidation/reduction charge between 0.17 and 0.69mCcm−2. The combination of the electrochromic parameters and high stability should enable the CNT/PB films to be suitable for technological applications.

Antioxidant activity by a synergy of redox-sensitive mitochondrial phospholipase A2 and uncoupling protein-2 in lung and spleen,

Abstract: Mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) has been suggested to participate in the attenuation of the reactive oxygen species production, but the mechanism of action and the physiological significance of UCP2 activity remain controversial. Here we tested the hypothesis that UCP2 provides feedback downregulation of oxidative stress in vivo via synergy with an H2O2-activated mitochondrial calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (mt-iPLA2). Tert-butylhydroperoxide or H2O2 induced free fatty acid release from mitochondrial membranes as detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, which was inhibited by r-bromoenol lactone (r-BEL) but not by its stereoisomer s-BEL, suggesting participation of mt-iPLA2γ isoform. Tert-butylhydroperoxide or H2O2 also induced increase in respiration and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential in lung and spleen mitochondria from control but not UCP2-knockout mice. These data suggest that mt-iPLA2γ-dependent release of free fatty acids promotes UCP2-dependent uncoupling. Upon such uncoupling, mitochondrial superoxide formation decreased instantly also in the s-BEL presence, but not when mt-iPLA2 was blocked by R-BEL and not in mitochondria from UCP2-knockout mice. Mt-iPLA2γ was alternatively activated by H2O2 produced probably in conjunction with the electron-transferring flavoprotein:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETFQOR), acting in fatty acid β-oxidation. Palmitoyl-d,l-carnitine addition to mouse lung mitochondria, respiring with succinate plus rotenone, caused a respiration increase that was sensitive to r-BEL and insensitive to s-BEL. We thus demonstrate for the first time that UCP2, functional due to fatty acids released by redox-activated mt-iPLA2γ, suppresses mitochondrial superoxide production by its uncoupling action. In conclusion, H2O2-activated mt-iPLA2γ and UCP2 act in concert to protect against oxidative stress.

Abstract: Heterojunction is an important structure for the development of photovoltaic solar cells. In contrast to homojunction structures, heterojunction solar cells have internal crystalline interfaces, which will reflect part of the incident light, and this has not been considered carefully before though many heterostructure solar cells have been commercialized. This paper discusses the internal reflection for various material systems used for the development of heterostructure-based solar cells. It has been found that the most common heterostructure solar cells have internal reflection less than 2%, while some potential heterojunction solar cells such as ITO/GaAs, ITO/InP, Si/Ge, polymer/semiconductors and oxide semiconductors may have internal reflection as high as 20%. Also it is worse to have a window layer with a lower refractive index than the absorption layer for solar cells. Ignoring this strong internal reflection will lead to severe deterioration and reduction of conversion efficiency; therefore measures have to be taken to minimize or prevent this internal reflection.

Abstract: A conversion efficiency of 13.6% has been achieved in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cell with absorber layer fabricated by sequentially RF sputtering (In,Ga)2Se3 and CuSe targets and further annealing in Se vapor. The significant improvement, comparing with the efficiency of 10.8% for CIGS solar cell sputtering from a quaternary CIGS target, was attributed to smoother surface, better crystallinity, and more compact structure of the CIGS film. The reaction pathway of (In,Ga)2Se3/CuSe bilayer was discussed, and such a bilayer design was demonstrated to be energetically favorable to form a better-crystallized CIGS film.

Abstract: Polymer-based thin-film luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) currently rely on poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) as host matrix material. However, PMMA-based LSCs still suffer from degradation due to the limited photostability of the polymer. In this work, a new crosslinked fluoropolymer-based system is presented as a potential alternative host matrix material for the fabrication of durable polymer-based LSC devices. The new host matrix system is obtained by crosslinking a functional chloro-trifluoro-ethylene-vinyl-ether copolymer with an aliphatic isocyanurate crosslinker. It is shown that efficiency values comparable to those obtained with optimized PMMA-based thin film LSC devices can be reached with the new crosslinked fluoropolymer-based LSC system. In addition, superior long-term operational stability compared to PMMA-based devices can be obtained with the new fluoropolymer-based host matrix, as evidenced by long-term continuous light exposure tests (over 500h) on operating LSC devices. The results of this work demonstrate that crosslinked fluorinated polymers represent a class of promising host matrix materials to achieve environmentally stable LSC devices.

Interleukin-17 modulates myoblast cell migration by inhibiting urokinase type plasminogen activator expression through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase,

Abstract: Interleukin-17 belongs to a family of pro-inflammatory cytokines with pleiotropic effects, which can be associated with several inflammatory diseases of the muscle tissue. Although elevated levels of interleukin-17 have been described in inflammatory myopathies, its role in muscle homeostasis remains to be elucidated. The requirement of the urokinase type plasminogen activator in skeletal myogenesis was recently demonstrated in vivo and in vitro, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of extracellular matrix remodeling, cell migration and myoblast fusion. Our previous results have demonstrated that interleukin-17 inhibits myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts in vitro concomitantly with the inhibition of cell migration. However, the involvement of urokinase type plasminogen activator in interleukin-17-inhibited myogenesis and migration remained to be analyzed. Therefore, the effect of interleukin-17 on the production of urokinase type plasminogen activator by C2C12 myoblasts was determined in the present study. Our results demonstrated that interleukin-17 strongly inhibits urokinase type plasminogen activator expression during myogenic differentiation. This reduction of urokinase type plasminogen activator production corresponded with the inhibition of cell migration by interleukin-17. Activation of p38 signaling pathway elicited by interleukin-17 mediated the inhibition of both urokinase type plasminogen activator expression and cell migration. Additionally, IL-17 inhibited C2C12 cells migration by causing the cells to reorganize their cytoskeleton and lose polarity. Therefore, our results suggest a novel mechanism by which interleukin-17 regulates myogenic differentiation through the inhibition of urokinase type plasminogen activator expression and cell migration. Accordingly, interleukin-17 may represent a potential clinical target worth investigating for the treatment of inflammatory muscle diseases.

Abstract: We theoretically and experimentally investigate the effect of the incidence angle and polarization of sunlight on the optimized layer structure of organic solar cells (OSCs) to obtain the best absorption efficiency in a realistic deployment situation. We use the generalized transfer matrix method with respect to the incidence angle and polarization, which can calculate the spatial distribution of the optical power dissipation in both the incoherent glass substrate and the coherent multilayer without using any indirect correction factor. The angular dependence of the short-circuit current, the open-circuit voltage, and the output electric power is calculated and compared with the experimental results. Using the simulation parameters matched with the experimental results, we calculate the generation energy density per day by considering the variation of the incidence angle during daytime and determine the optimized thickness of the active region for maximum absorption efficiency. We show that the optimized active-region thickness based on the generation energy density per day is different from that determined from the variation of the short-circuit current density in only normal incidence, which is generally used for optimizing device structure of OSCs.

Abstract: The operation of a photoelectrochemical cell for hydrogen production by water decomposition under simulated sunlight (a 150W Xe lamp) with a hybrid photoanode based on a Si solar cell and TiO2 film as well as with a metal-hydride cathode based on LaNi5 alloy has been investigated. TiO2 films were produced by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. A new technique of production of continuous CVD TiO2 films on semiconductor surface has been proposed. The peculiarity of this technique is a deposition of a thin (30–40nm) Ti layer on the substrate prior to a TiO2 deposition. This metal layer serves as the catalyst of following TiO2 film growth and then it is oxidized to TiO2. Continuous TiO2 films obtained by such a way protect the solar cell surface from oxidation in the electrolyte. The optimal TiO2 film thickness and structure for highest photocurrent have been determined. It has been shown that the use of the metal-hydride cathode based on LaNi5 alloy instead of a Pt cathode increases significantly (up to 50%) the solar cell efficiency. The photoconversion efficiency attained 2% with the Pt cathode and 3% with the metal-hydride cathode.

Abstract: State-of-the-art optical trapping designs for tandem thin film silicon solar cells in the superstrate configuration commonly feature two elements: a textured transparent conductive oxide front contact and a low refractive index interlayer between top and bottom cell. We investigate more advanced super light trapping schemes that have been designed and implemented in thin film tandem junctions at different levels in the solar cells to further enhance light trapping capabilities. Regularly patterned nano-imprinted substrates offer an additional capability to tune the substrate morphology and optimize it for enhanced solar cell performance. We show that the onset of defect formation in thin film layers can be controlled and that the spectral response in the infra-red part of the spectrum is increased. Intermediate reflectors with ultra-low refractive indeces and plasmonic properties lead to increased light confinement in top cells. Results show that reducing the refractive index below 1.5 still leads to a substantial current increase in the top cell. These innovative designs improve the output current in amorphous/microcrystalline tandem devices with thin photo-active layers. In addition, they surprisingly enhance the electrical parameters of the tandem cells with a record open circuit voltage of 1.47V. Plasmonic effects of metal nano-particles embedded in interlayers do not compromise the electrical solar cell parameters and similarly strengthen light confinement in the top cell, however detrimental effects are observed in the bottom cell current output.

Abstract: Passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) are considered to be the next generation of industrial-type screen-printed silicon solar cells. Deposition methods for rear passivation layers have to meet both the high-throughput and low-cost requirements of the PV industry in combination with high-quality surface passivation properties. In this paper, we evaluate and optimise a novel deposition technique for AlOx passivation layers by applying an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) process. The ICP AlOx deposition process enables high deposition rates up to 5nm/s as well as excellent surface recombination velocities below 10cm/s after firing. A fixed negative charge of −4×1012cm−2 is measured for ICP AlOx single layers with an interface state density of 11.0×1011eV−1cm−2 at midgap position. When applied to PERC solar cells the ICP AlOx layer is capped with a PECVD SiNy layer. We achieve independently confirmed conversion efficiencies of up to 20.1% for large-area (15.6×15.6cm2) PERC solar cells with screen-printed metal contacts and ICP AlOx/SiNy rear side passivation on standard boron-doped Czochralski-grown silicon wafers. The internal quantum efficiency reveals an effective rear surface recombination velocity Srear of (90±30)cm/s and an internal rear reflectance Rb of (91±1)% which demonstrates the excellent rear surface passivation of the ICP AlOx/SiNy layer stack.

Abstract: Organic solar cells (OSC) show great potential as a low-cost energy source. In addition, their mechanical flexibility allows the added advantage of use on a wide variety of surfaces. In recent years, progress in experimental strategies and modeling approaches have enabled enhancing the power conversion efficiencies of OSC. In particular, simulation based analysis has played a significant role in improving our understanding of the charge transport phenomena in the active layer of these devices. The excitonic drift-diffusion (EDD) model has been used widely to simulate the generation and transport properties of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The EDD model – which is derived from the Boltzmann transport is dependent on a number of input parameters such as (1) material properties (mobility and permittivity), (2) operating conditions (illumination and device thickness), and (3) active layer morphology. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the short-circuit current, Jsc, to the input parameters is performed. This helps in rank ordering the input parameters and operating conditions – by strength and relevance – on their impact on Jsc. We particularly focus our investigations on understanding how the active layer morphology affects the sensitivity of Jsc. To accomplish this we analyze three classes of morphologies: bilayer, BHJ, and sawtooth. The results show significant differences in sensitivities between BHJ, sawtooth, and bilayer morphologies. Short-circuit current in BHJ structure shows higher sensitivity to material properties than either sawtooth and bilayer structure, suggesting that the necessity for finer control of material properties to counteract the increased disorder in the active layer morphology. The electrode current is found to be most sensitive to illumination intensity for all three morphologies. We report some interesting trends that may help choose the most sensitive parameters to vary for designing OSC's with better performance.

Abstract: In this study, immobilized ZnO semiconductor on stainless steel mesh was used in photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). To determine optimum conditions of photoreduction of CO2 and CH4, one of the experimental design techniques i.e. response surface methodology (RSM) was applied. Different properties of commercial and calcinated photocatalysts on mesh surface were characterized using XRD, SEM and UV–vis analysis, and photoreduction products were identified using GC-TCD and FTIR in gas medium. Calcination of coated ZnO increased the absorption of UV–vis light, reduced the agglomeration and led to uniform structure of photocatalyst. Optimization of experimental conditions indicate that maximum conversion of carbon dioxide was achieved in CO2 ratio of 10%, UV light power of 250W, total pressure of 30psi and 8g ZnO coated on mesh. Also, the products of the conversion were characterized to be formate and acetate derivatives.

Abstract: We have investigated the characteristics of transparent and flexible PEDOT:PSS electrodes passivated by thin InZnSnO (IZTO) film for flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs). Using damage-free linear facing target sputtering (LFTS), an IZTO passivation layer was deposited on the gravure printed PEDOT:PSS electrode without causing plasma damage. The thickness of the IZTO passivation layer was found to critically affect electrical and optical properties of the IZTO/PEDOT multilayer because the continuity and morphology of the thin IZTO passivation layer were greatly influenced by thickness. At optimized IZTO passivation thickness of 20nm, the IZTO/PEDOT:PSS multilayer electrode exhibited decreased sheet resistance of 353.6Ω/sq and optical transmittance of 83.09% without flexibility degradation. The FOSC with an optimized IZTO/PEDOT:PSS electrode showed better performances than the FOSC with PEDOT:PSS electrodes due to the effect of a stable IZTO passivation layer. This indicates that IZTO passivation on the PEDOT:PSS electrode using a LFTS is one of the key solutions for improving the properties and stability of flexible PEDOT:PSS electrodes for high performance FOSCs.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a novel encapsulation method for organic photovoltaic (OPV) with solution process. Inverted structure of organic photovoltaic (OPV) is used because its stability is better than that of the conventional structure. Zinc Oxide (ZnO) is used as a buffer layer on top of the anode electrode to reduce damage to the OPV device since the OPV device should be protected from the solution which is used for encapsulation. We found that the UV resin (400μm) encapsulation with ZnO buffer layer enhanced the stability of the device, where the power conversion efficiency (PCE) degrades by 20.5% after 672h in air.

Abstract: Calculations of the integrated absorptive capacity of CdTe layer taking into account the spectral distributions of the standard AM1.5 solar radiation and the absorption coefficient of the material have been carried out. It is shown that the complete absorption of photons (≥99.9%) in CdTe in the hv>Eg range takes place at a layer thickness d more than 20–30μm, and the absorptivity is about 93% at d=1μm. Based on the continuity equation and taking into account the recombination at the front and rear surfaces of the CdTe layer as well as in the space–charge region, the restrictions imposed on the thickness of the absorber layer in CdS/CdTe heterojunction are investigated. It is substantiated a combination of material parameters, for which thickness of the CdTe absorber is minimized. In all cases, along with the mobilities and lifetimes of charge carriers, the concentration of uncompensated impurities in CdTe, which determines the width of the space–charge region, plays a key role in the generation of photocurrent. The obtained results indicate that, when the CdTe absorber layer is too thin, it is impossible to avoid a noticeable decrease of the short-circuit current density as compared with a typical thickness of the CdTe layer (2–3μm). The decrease in Jsc is more than 20% when the thickness of the CdTe layer is 0.5μm compared to ~5% for a thickness of 2–3μm.

Abstract: It is desirable to be able to estimate the light trapping performance of glass in photovoltaic applications prior to depositing the active semiconductor layer onto it. However, conventional methods such as haze, root-mean-square roughness (Rms) are not very effective. Additionally, decoupling the geometries of two surfaces (“surface decoupling”) is known to enhance light trapping effectively. In this investigation, clear surface decoupling is observed between the inner surface in contact with an aluminium induced textured (AIT) glass surface and the exposed Si film surface grown on such glass by using cross-sectional focused ion beam (FIB) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging. Results suggest that light travelling from a texture on glass to a texture on the exposed Si film surface growing from the same glass texture gets randomised to some extent depending on the decoupling degree between the two textures. The surface decoupling degree can be characterised by a calculated correlation coefficient (CC) between decoupled surfaces. The CC calculation requires the topographies of both AIT glass and the Si film grown on such glass, with the former extracted from atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the latter calculated by a self-coding model based on the underlying AIT glass topography. This CC is found to form a stronger correlation with light trapping capability of AIT glass compared to the conventional light trapping estimation methods.

Abstract: In the present study, the direct photoconversion of carbon dioxide and methane in an appropriate gas-phase batch reactor under visible light was investigated. In the photocatalytic reaction system copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) modified titanium dioxide (CuPc/TiO2) photocatalyst that was coated on stainless steel mesh was used. The morphology of CuPc/TiO2 photocatalysts were characterized using XRD, SEM, FTIR and UV–vis analyses, and photoreduction products were identified using GC-TCD, GC–MS and FTIR in gas medium. The results of SEM have shown limited presence of CuPc on TiO2 surface, also the results of UV–vis have shown that the absorbance spectra of titania extended to visible spectral region. The results of photocatalytic activity have shown the conversion of 14% and 18% for CO2 and CH4 under modified TiO2 and visible light, respectively. However, the conversions of CO2 and CH4 under unmodified TiO2 and visible light were zero, approximately. Based on GC–MS and FTIR analyses, final products of conversion were characterized to be formate and acetate derivatives, and a mechanism involving the photoactivation of both TiO2 and CuPc sensitizer is proposed.

Abstract: Smoking is associated with a declining quality of semen. The aim of this study was to screen and investigate the differential expression of proteins extracted from the epididymis of mice exposed daily with cigarette smoke. Using MALDI-TOF–MS analysis, we found that the protein profile of the mouse epididymis was altered by cigarette smoking and identified 27 proteins from the most abundant and differentially expressed spots in the 2-DE gels of epididymal samples. These proteins were classified into groups according to their functions such as energy metabolism, reproduction and structural molecule activity. Through pathway analysis, these proteins were associated with the glutathione metabolism and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. These results showed that the epididymis may experience oxidative stress following cigarette smoke exposure, which was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. We determine that cigarette smoking can induce oxidative stress in the mouse epididymis, which may cause protein profile altering, thereby impairing epididymis function, and leading to a decline in semen quality.

Abstract: MiR-122 is a liver-speciﬁc miRNA. Recent studies demonstrated that the interferon (IFN) therapy efficacy is poor in the hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients with lower miR-122 abundance in the livers. The hepatocarcinoma patients also have low miR-122 levels in their livers. We previously found that the IFN expression was reduced when miR-122 was knocked down in human oligodendrocytes. The mechanism is unclear. In this study, the miR-122-abundant cell Huh7 was used to explore the regulatory mechanism of miR-122 on type I IFN expression. We found that miR-122 significantly increased the type I IFN expression in Huh7 cells, while knocking down miR-122 decreased the type I IFN expression. By screening potential miR-122 targets among the negative regulators in IFN signaling pathways, we found that there were putative miR-122 targets in the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) mRNA. Over-expressing miR-122 decreased the SOCS1 expression by 50.55% in Huh7 cells, while knocking down miR-122 increased SOCS1 expression by 62.56%. Using a green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fused SOCS1-expressing plasmid, the SOCS1-EGFP fluorescence intensity and protein were lower in miR-122 mimic-treated cells than those in mock-miRNA-treated cells, while miR-122 knockdown significantly increased the SOCS1-EGFP fluorescence intensity and protein expression. Mutations in the nt359–nt375 region abandoned the impact of miR-122 on SOCS1-EGFP expression. Taken together, SOCS1 is a target of miR-122. MiR-122 can regulate the type I IFN expression through modulating the SOCS1 expression.

Abstract: Concentrator solar cells need to be designed optimally depending on the concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) system, application and operating conditions to ensure the best system performance. The important factors while designing include concentration ratio, cell material properties, expected operating temperature, cell shape, bus bar configuration, number of fingers their size and spacing. The irradiation incident on the solar cell while being concentrated experiences several losses caused by the different physical phenomena’s occurring in the system. A particular issue for CPV technology is the non-uniformity of the incident flux on the solar cell which tends to cause hot spots, current mismatch and reduce the overall efficiency of the system. Understanding of this effect and designing the cell while considering these issues, would help in improving the overall performance of the system. This study focuses on modelling a low concentrating photovoltaic system used for building integration, optimising the cell metallisation and analysing the effects of temperature on the overall output of the system. The optical analysis of the concentrator is carried out using ray tracing and finite element methods to determine electrical and thermal performance under operating conditions. Furthermore, an analysis is made to understand the effects of non-uniformity on the output of the device. About 0.5% absolute drop in solar cell efficiency was observed due to non-uniformity at 5o incident angle. A relative drop of 1.85% was observed in the fill factor due to non-uniformity of the flux distribution. A maximum cell temperature of 349.5K was observed across the cell in both uniform and non-uniform conditions under an incident solar radiation of 1000W/m2 which further reduced the performance of the solar cell. The solar cell design was also analysed by varying the number of fingers and the optimum grid design reported. A small prototype concentrator based on the design proposed was made using polyurethane and tested experimentally with the optimized solar cell design. On comparing the results obtained using the experimental data a good agreement in the system output could be seen. The difference in the overall system output was seen to be of the order of 11% which could be due to several losses occurring in the prototype which were not accounted in the model.

Abstract: ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) proteins have been recognized as key players in cellular physiological transport processes. ABC transporter A6 (ABCA6) is a member of the ABC subfamily A. Although it was cloned more than 10 years ago, its expression regulation, subcellular localization, and physiologic function remain largely unknown. We here demonstrated that expression of ABCA6 was Forkhead box O (FoxO)-dependent in human endothelial cell line EA.hy926 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Two functional FoxO-responsive elements were identified in ABCA6 promoter and characterized in detail. ABCA6 mRNA was suppressed by insulin-like growth factor-1 which stimulates the phosphorylation and inactivation of FoxOs while inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase had the opposite effect. By immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, ABCA6 protein is localized primarily in an intracellular compartment, likely representing the Golgi apparatus. ABCA6 mRNA was demonstrated to be responsive to cholesterol loading as well as 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors in human endothelial cells. Our data provide evidence for an essential role of FoxO proteins in the transcription of ABCA6 in human vascular endothelial cells. Based on its cholesterol responsiveness, a potential involvement of ABCA6 in intracellular lipid transport processes may be anticipated.

Abstract: A study on the photo-degradation mechanism of a perylene-based thin-film organic luminescent solar concentrator (OLSC) is presented in this work. By exposing the OLSC thin film in air to continuous illumination in strong free-radical generating conditions, potential degradation pathways in the dye molecule could be proposed. Significant modifications to the molecular structure of the organic dye were observed upon light-exposure by means of photoluminescence, UV–vis and FTIR spectroscopy. In addition, online GC–MS analysis of volatile degradation products allowed to identify a potential degradation mechanism for the dye molecule in the OLSC thin film, initiating with the disruption of the lateral phenyl substituents attached to the perylene core of the organic dye. In addition, a correlation was found between chemical modifications occurring to the organic dye molecule and operational stability of OLSC devices, clarifying the effect of dye photo-degradation on device performance. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the photo-degradation mechanism of perylene-based OLSC devices and allow for the development of efficient stabilization strategies to lengthen OLSC lifetime.

Abstract: An optimized textured structure is a key for high efficiency multi-crystalline silicon solar cell. In this work, black silicon wafers with various structures have been successfully produced by plasma immersion ion implantation. The surface morphology, reflectance and internal quantum efficiency have been investigated by atomic force microscope, spectrophotometer and quantum efficiency measurement system, respectively. Results show that nanohillocks with average height of 150–600nm have been generated on black silicon surfaces by different texturing conditions, and the reflectance over the wavelength from 300nm to 1100nm decreases with increasing the height of nanohillocks, whereas the internal quantum efficiency worsens. The solar cell based on the optimized nanohillocks height of 300nm yeilds efficiency of 15.99% with short circuit current of 34.0mA/cm2.

Abstract: It is known that the formation of voids in solar cell solder joints leads to a worsening of their heat sinking capabilities, causing an increase in the average device temperature and thermal resistance. This phenomenon can be detrimental for the solar cell's performance, since the open-circuit voltage linearly decreases with temperature. The performances of silicon solar cells, in the presence of voids in the cell solder joint, are studied by means of numerical simulations and of an analytical thermal model which can assess the local temperature increase at cell surface due to a single isolated void in the solder joint. The results show that for small isolated voids the analytical model gives temperature peaks above the voids which match very well with the simulations result, within 5% of relative error. The analytical model also gives an estimation of the whole device thermal resistance, in the presence of a regular pattern of non-interacting voids all with the same surface area. For a 10×7 pattern of small area voids the analytical value for the device thermal resistance matches well with the results of numerical simulations, with a maximum error of 17.3% at 70% void coverage. To determine the temperature profile of the device surface we have implemented a thermal finite element analysis (FEA) which employs a detailed 3D model of the real morphology of voids in the solar cell, obtained by X-ray inspection. The resulting temperature map has been used as an input parameter for the subsequent electrical simulations performed by means of PSPICE software, which is based on a distributed 2.5 D electrical model of the solar cell. Results show that, for a concentrating factor of 100×, a real void pattern with 36.6% void coverage does not noticeably affect the performances of a concentrator silicon solar cell.

Abstract: Solar selective coatings draw much attention due to its critical role in solar receiver employed in solar heat power generation. Al/Ti0.5Al0.5N/Ti0.25Al0.75N/AlN solar selective coating exhibits a high absorptance of 0.926–0.945 in solar spectrum range and low emittance of 0.04–0.06 (82°C) in infrared spectrum range. The microstructure of the solar selective coatings by using Al as metal reflector layer had been analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), auger electron spectroscopy (AES), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM). After long time annealed in air, the coating is observed to lost effectiveness in solar spectrum adsorption. More Ti–N bonds rather than Ti–N–O bonds are observed in Ti0.5Al0.5N layer. The experimental results also indicate that the crystallization of the adsorption layers is not complete. It is believed that oxygen diffused into the Ti–Al–N layer to form Ti–Al–O–N structure, and the destruction of the four-layer structure, lead to the degradation of the coatings after long time (>192h) annealed in air at high temperature (500°C). Compared with the thermal stability in air, the coatings are much more stable in vacuum under high temperature, which makes it is more appropriate to be used in vacuum.
