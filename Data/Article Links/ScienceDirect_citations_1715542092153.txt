Abstract: Increasing studies have shown protective effects of intermittent hypoxia on brain injury and heart ischemia. However, the effect of intermittent hypoxia on blood glucose metabolism, especially in diabetic conditions, is rarely observed. The aim of this study was to investigate whether intermittent hypoxia influences blood glucose metabolism in type 1 diabetic rats. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic adult rats and age-matched control rats were treated with intermittent hypoxia (at an altitude of 3 km, 4 h per day for 3 weeks) or normoxia as control. Fasting blood glucose, body weight, plasma fructosamine, plasma insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), pancreas β-cell mass, and hepatic and soleus glycogen were measured. Compared with diabetic rats before treatment, the level of fasting blood glucose in diabetic rats after normoxic treatment was increased (19.88±5.69 mmol/L vs. 14.79±5.84 mmol/L, p < 0.05), while it was not different in diabetic rats after hypoxic treatment (13.14±5.77 mmol/L vs. 14.79±5.84 mmol/L, p > 0.05). Meanwhile, fasting blood glucose in diabetic rats after hypoxic treatment was also lower than that in diabetic rats after normoxic treatment (13.14±5.77 mmol/L vs. 19.88±5.69 mmol/L, p<0.05). Plasma fructosamine in diabetic rats receiving intermittent hypoxia was significantly lower than that in diabetic rats receiving normoxia (1.28±0.11 vs. 1.39 ± 0.11, p < 0.05), while there were no significant changes in body weight, plasma insulin and β-cell mass. HOMA-IR in diabetic rats after hypoxic treatment was also lower compared with diabetic rats after normoxic treatment (3.48±0.48 vs. 3.86 ± 0.42, p < 0.05). Moreover, intermittent hypoxia showed effect on the increase of soleus glycogen but not hepatic glycogen. We conclude that intermittent hypoxia maintains glycemia in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and its regulation on muscular glycogenesis may play a role in the underlying mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal infection during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes for the fetus, including postnatal cognitive disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms are obscure. We find that bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (CW), a universal PAMP for TLR2, traverses the murine placenta into the developing fetal brain. In contrast to adults, CW-exposed fetal brains did not show any signs of inflammation or neuronal death. Instead, the neuronal transcription factor FoxG1 was induced, and neuroproliferation leading to a 50% greater density of neurons in the cortical plate was observed. Bacterial infection of pregnant dams, followed by antibiotic treatment, which releases CW, yielded the same result. Neuroproliferation required TLR2 and was recapitulated in vitro with fetal neuronal precursor cells and TLR2/6, but not TLR2/1, ligands. The fetal neuroproliferative response correlated with abnormal cognitive behavior in CW-exposed pups following birth. Thus, the bacterial CW-TLR2 signaling axis affects fetal neurodevelopment and may underlie postnatal cognitive disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Heterozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) represent the strongest common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association are still poorly understood. Here, we have analyzed ten independent induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from three controls and three unrelated PD patients heterozygous for the GBA-N370S mutation, and identified relevant disease mechanisms. After differentiation into dopaminergic neurons, we observed misprocessing of mutant glucocerebrosidase protein in the ER, associated with activation of ER stress and abnormal cellular lipid profiles. Furthermore, we observed autophagic perturbations and an enlargement of the lysosomal compartment specifically in dopamine neurons. Finally, we found increased extracellular α-synuclein in patient-derived neuronal culture medium, which was not associated with exosomes. Overall, ER stress, autophagic/lysosomal perturbations, and elevated extracellular α-synuclein likely represent critical early cellular phenotypes of PD, which might offer multiple therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
MiR-34a was demonstrated to be upregulated during the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). Overexpression of miR-34a significantly increased alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization capacity, and the expression of osteogenesis-associated genes in hASCs in vitro. Enhanced heterotopic bone formation in vivo was also observed upon overexpression of miR-34a in hASCs. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-34a inhibited the expression of retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (RBP2) and reduced the luciferase activity of reporter gene construct comprising putative miR-34a binding sites in the 3′ UTR of RBP2. Moreover, miR-34a downregulated the expression of NOTCH1 and CYCLIN D1 and upregulated the expression of RUNX2 by targeting RBP2, NOTCH1, and CYCLIN D1. Taken together, our results suggested that miR-34a promotes the osteogenic differentiation of hASCs via the RBP2/NOTCH1/CYCLIN D1 coregulatory network, indicating that miR-34a-targeted therapy could be a valuable approach to promote bone regeneration.

Abstract: In the endothelial recovery process, bone marrow-derived MSCs are a potential source of cells for both research and therapy, and their capacities to self-renew and to differentiate into all the cell types in the human body make them a promising therapeutic agent for remodeling cellular differentiation and a valuable resource for the treatment of many diseases. Based on the results provided in a miRNA database, we selected miRNAs with unique targets in cell fate-related signaling pathways. The tested miRNAs targeting GSK-3β (miR-26a), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and CD133 (miR-26a and miR-29b) induced MSC differentiation into functional ECs, whereas miRNAs targeting VEGF receptor (miR-15, miR-144, miR-145, and miR-329) inhibited MSC differentiation into ECs through VEGF stimulation. In addition, the expression levels of these miRNAs were correlated with in vivo physiological endothelial recovery processes. These findings indicate that the miRNA expression profile is distinct for cells in different stages of differentiation from MSCs to ECs and that specific miRNAs can function as regulators of endothelialization.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming to pluripotency after overexpression of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC is accompanied by global genomic and epigenomic changes. Histone modification and DNA methylation states in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been shown to be highly similar to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, epigenetic differences still exist between iPSCs and ESCs. In particular, aberrant DNA methylation states found in iPSCs are a major concern when using iPSCs in a clinical setting. Thus, it is critical to find factors that regulate DNA methylation states in reprogramming. Here, we found that the miR-29 family is an important epigenetic regulator during human somatic cell reprogramming. Our global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation analysis shows that DNA demethylation is a major event mediated by miR-29a depletion during early reprogramming, and that iPSCs derived from miR-29a depletion are epigenetically closer to ESCs. Our findings uncover an important miRNA-based approach to generate clinically robust iPSCs.

MAGP2 controls Notch via interactions with RGD binding integrins: Identification of a novel ECM–integrin–Notch signaling axis,

Abstract: Canonical Notch signaling involves Notch receptor activation via interaction with cell surface bound Notch ligand. Recent findings also indicate that Notch signaling may be modulated by cross-talk with other signaling mechanisms. The ECM protein MAGP2 was previously shown to regulate Notch in a cell type dependent manner, although the molecular details of this interaction have not been dissected. Here, we report that MAGP2 cell type specific control of Notch is independent of individual Notch receptor-ligand combinations but dependent on interaction with RGD binding integrins. Overexpressed MAGP2 was found to suppress transcriptional activity from the Notch responsive Hes1 promoter activity in endothelial cells, while overexpression of a RGD→RGE MAGP2 mutant increased Notch signaling in the same cell type. This effect was not unique to MAGP2 since the RGD domain of the ECM protein EGFL7 was also found to be an important modulator of Hes1 promoter activity. Independently of MAGP2 or EGFL7, inhibition of RGD-binding integrins with soluble RGD peptides also increased accumulation of active N1ICD fragments and Notch responsive promoter activity independently of changes in Notch1, Jag1, or Dll4 expression. Finally, β1 or β3 integrin blocking antibodies also enhanced Notch signaling. Collectively, these results answer the question of how MAGP2 controls cell type dependent Notch signaling, but more importantly uncover a new mechanism to understand how extracellular matrices and cellular environments impact Notch signaling.

Abstract: Thioredoxin reductase 2 (TrxR2) is a selenium (Se) containing protein. Se deficiency is associated with an endemic osteoarthropathy characterized by impaired cartilage formation. It is unclear whether TrxR2 have roles in cartilage function. We examined the effects of TrxR2 on chondrogenic ATDC5 cells through shRNA-mediated gene silencing of TrxR2. We demonstrated TrxR2 deficiencies could enhance chondrogenic differentiation and apoptosis of ATDC5 cells. TrxR2 deficiencies increased accumulation of cartilage glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and mineralization. TrxR2 deficiencies also stimulated expression of extracellular (ECM) gene including Collagen II and Aggrecan. The enhanced chondrogenic properties were further confirmed by activation of Akt signaling which are required for chondrogenesis. In addition, TrxR2 deficiencies promoted chondrocyte proliferation through acceleration of cell cycle progression by increase in both S and G2/M phase cell distribution accompanied with induction of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). Moreover, TrxR2 deficiencies induced chondrocyte death via apoptosis and increased cell sensitivity to exogenous oxidative stress. Furthermore, TrxR2 deficiencies induced emission of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) without alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ATP content. Finally, treatment of TrxR2 deficiency cells with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited mitochondrial ROS production and chondrocyte apoptosis. NAC also prevented chondrogenic differentiation of TrxR2 deficiency cells by suppression of ECM gene expression, GAGs accumulation and mineralization, as well as attenuation of Akt signaling. Thus, TrxR2-mediated mitochondrial integrity is indispensable for chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells. TrxR2 deficiency-induced impaired proliferation and death of chondrocytes may be the pathological mechanism of the osteoarthropathy due to Se deficiency. Notably, this study also uncover the roles of mitochondrial ROS which could stimulate cartilage ECM synthesis that offer novel insights for development of therapeutic agent to prevent cartilage degeneration in human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cell lines grown as two-dimensional (2D) cultures have been an essential model for studying cancer biology and anticancer drug discovery. However, 2D cancer cell cultures have major limitations, as they do not closely mimic the heterogeneity and tissue context of in vivo tumors. Developing three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures, such as multicellular tumor spheroids, has the potential to address some of these limitations. Here, we combined a high-throughput gene expression profiling method with a tumor spheroid-based drug-screening assay to identify context-dependent treatment responses. As a proof of concept, we examined drug responses of quiescent cancer cells to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inhibitors. Use of multicellular tumor spheroids led to discovery that the mevalonate pathway is upregulated in quiescent cells during OXPHOS inhibition, and that OXPHOS inhibitors and mevalonate pathway inhibitors were synergistically toxic to quiescent spheroids. This work illustrates how 3D cellular models yield functional and mechanistic insights not accessible via 2D cultures.

Abstract: Recent lineage tracing studies showed that the prostate basal and luminal cells in adult mice are two independent lineages under the physiological condition, but basal cells are capable of generating luminal progenies during bacterial infection-induced prostatitis. Because acute bacterial infection in human prostate tissues is relatively rare, the disease relevance of the bacterial infection-induced basal-to-luminal differentiation is uncertain. Herein we employ a high fat diet-induced sterile prostate inflammation model to determine whether basal-to-luminal differentiation can be induced by inflammation irrespective of the underlying etiologies. A K14-CreER model and a fluorescent report line are utilized to specifically label basal cells with the green fluorescent protein. We show that high fat diet promotes immune cell infiltration into the prostate tissues and basal-to-luminal differentiation. Increased cell proliferation accompanies basal-to-luminal differentiation, suggesting a concurrent regulation of basal cell proliferation and differentiation. This study demonstrates that basal-to-luminal differentiation can be induced by different types of prostate inflammation evolved with distinct etiologies. Finally, high fat diet also accelerates initiation and progression of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia that are originated from basal cells with loss-of-function of the tumor suppressor Pten. Because prostate cancer originated from basal cells tends to be invasive, our study also provides an alternative explanation for the association between obesity and aggressive prostate cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) are a promising class of targeted cancer drugs, but their individual target profiles beyond the PARP family, which could result in differential clinical use or toxicity, are unknown. Using an unbiased, mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics approach, we generated a comparative proteome-wide target map of the four clinical PARPi, olaparib, veliparib, niraparib, and rucaparib. PARPi as a class displayed high target selectivity. However, in addition to the canonical targets PARP1, PARP2, and several of their binding partners, we also identified hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) and deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) as previously unrecognized targets of rucaparib and niraparib, respectively. Subsequent functional validation suggested that inhibition of DCK by niraparib could have detrimental effects when combined with nucleoside analog pro-drugs. H6PD silencing can cause apoptosis and further sensitize cells to PARPi, suggesting that H6PD may be, in addition to its established role in metabolic disorders, a new anticancer target.

Abstract: Heat shock protein gene (Hsp) families are thought to be important in thermal adaptation, but their expression patterns under various thermal stresses have still been poorly characterized outside of model systems. We have therefore characterized Hsp genes and their stress responses in the oriental fruit moth (OFM), Grapholita molesta, a widespread global orchard pest, and compared patterns of expression in this species to that of other insects. Genes from four Hsp families showed variable expression levels among tissues and developmental stages. Members of the Hsp40, 70, and 90 families were highly expressed under short exposures to heat and cold. Expression of Hsp40, 70, and Hsc70 family members increased in OFM undergoing diapause, while Hsp90 was downregulated. We found that there was strong sequence conservation of members of large Hsp families (Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsc70) across taxa, but this was not always matched by conservation of expression patterns. When the large Hsps as well as small Hsps from OFM were compared under acute and ramping heat stress, two groups of sHsps expression patterns were apparent, depending on whether expression increased or decreased immediately after stress exposure. These results highlight potential differences in conservation of function as opposed to sequence in this gene family and also point to Hsp genes potentially useful as bioindicators of diapause and thermal stress in OFM.

Abstract: Summary
RNA viruses exhibit a variety of genome organization strategies, including multicomponent genomes in which each segment is packaged separately. Although multicomponent genomes are common among viruses infecting plants and fungi, their prevalence among those infecting animals remains unclear. We characterize a multicomponent RNA virus isolated from mosquitoes, designated Guaico Culex virus (GCXV). GCXV belongs to a diverse clade of segmented viruses (Jingmenvirus) related to the prototypically unsegmented Flaviviridae. The GCXV genome comprises five segments, each of which appears to be separately packaged. The smallest segment is not required for replication, and its presence is variable in natural infections. We also describe a variant of Jingmen tick virus, another Jingmenvirus, sequenced from a Ugandan red colobus monkey, thus expanding the host range of this segmented and likely multicomponent virus group. Collectively, this study provides evidence for the existence of multicomponent animal viruses and their potential relevance for animal and human health.

Abstract: Summary
Infection with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) can lead to Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a lethal form of skin cancer. However, the skin cell type productively infected by MCPyV remains a central question. We combined cell culture and ex vivo approaches to identify human dermal fibroblasts as natural host cells that support productive MCPyV infection. Based on this, we established a cell culture model for MCPyV infection, which will facilitate investigation of the oncogenic mechanisms for this DNA virus. Using this model, we discovered that induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes by the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and other growth factors stimulates MCPyV infection. This suggests that MCC risk factors such as UV radiation and aging, which are known to stimulate WNT signaling and MMP expression, may promote viral infection and thus drive MCC. Our study also introduces the FDA-approved MEK antagonist trametinib as an effective inhibitor for controlling MCPyV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the negative regulators of antiviral immune responses will be critical for advancing immune-modulated antiviral strategies. NLRX1, an NLR protein that negatively regulates innate immunity, was previously identified in an unbiased siRNA screen as required for HIV infection. We find that NLRX1 depletion results in impaired nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA in human monocytic cells. Additionally, NLRX1 was observed to reduce type-I interferon (IFN-I) and cytokines in response to HIV-1 reverse-transcribed DNA. NLRX1 sequesters the DNA-sensing adaptor STING from interaction with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which is a requisite for IFN-1 induction in response to DNA. NLRX1-deficient cells generate an amplified STING-dependent host response to cytosolic DNA, c-di-GMP, cGAMP, HIV-1, and DNA viruses. Accordingly, Nlrx1−/− mice infected with DNA viruses exhibit enhanced innate immunity and reduced viral load. Thus, NLRX1 is a negative regulator of the host innate immune response to HIV-1 and DNA viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Modern enzyme complexes are characterized by a high catalytic efficiency and allosteric communication between the constituting protein subunits. We were interested in whether primordial enzyme complexes from extinct species displayed a similar degree of functional sophistication. To this end, we used ancestral sequence reconstruction to resurrect the α and β subunits of the tryptophan synthase (TS) complex from the last bacterial common ancestor (LBCA), which presumably existed more than 3.4 billion years ago. We show that the LBCA TS subunits are thermostable and exhibit high catalytic activity. Moreover, they form a complex with αββα stoichiometry whose crystal structure is similar to that of modern TS. Kinetic analysis revealed that the reaction intermediate indole is channeled from the α to the β subunits and suggests that allosteric communication already occurred in LBCA TS.

In mammalian cells, the second messenger (2′–5′,3′–5′) cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (2′,3′-cGAMP), is produced by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAMP synthase (cGAS), and subsequently bound by the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to trigger interferon response. Thus, the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway plays a critical role in pathogen detection, as well as pathophysiological conditions including cancer and autoimmune disorders. However, studying and targeting this immune signaling pathway has been challenging due to the absence of tools for high-throughput analysis. We have engineered an RNA-based fluorescent biosensor that responds to 2′,3′-cGAMP. The resulting “mix-and-go” cGAS activity assay shows excellent statistical reliability as a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay and distinguishes between direct and indirect cGAS inhibitors. Furthermore, the biosensor enables quantitation of 2′,3′-cGAMP in mammalian cell lysates. We envision this biosensor-based assay as a resource to study the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway in the context of infectious diseases, cancer immunotherapy, and autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Coxsackievirus group B (CVB) is one of the common pathogens that cause myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Evidence has shown that CVB replication in cardiomyocytes is responsible for the damage and loss of cardiac muscle and the dysfunction of the heart. However, it remains largely undefined how CVB would directly impact cardiac fibroblasts, the most abundant cells in human heart. In this study, cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from Balb/c mice and infected with CVB type 3 (CVB3). Increased double-membraned, autophagosome-like vesicles in the CVB3-infected cardiac fibroblasts were observed with electron microscope. Punctate distribution of LC3 and increased level of LC3-II were also detected in the infected cardiac fibroblasts. Furthermore, we observed that the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α, was increased in the CVB3-infected cardiac fibroblasts, while suppressed autophagy by 3-MA and Atg7-siRNA inhibited cytokine expression. Consistent with the in vitro findings, increased formation of autophagosomes was observed in the cardiac fibroblasts of Balb/c mice infected with CVB3. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that cardiac fibroblasts respond to CVB3 infection with the formation of autophagosomes and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results suggest that the autophagic response of cardiac fibroblasts may play a role in the pathogenesis of myocarditis caused by CVB3 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Kinetoplastids cause Chagas disease, human African trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniases. Current treatments for these diseases are toxic and inefficient, and our limited knowledge of drug targets and inhibitors has dramatically hindered the development of new drugs. Here we used a chemogenetic approach to identify new kinetoplastid drug targets and inhibitors. We conditionally knocked down Trypanosoma brucei inositol phosphate (IP) pathway genes and showed that almost every pathway step is essential for parasite growth and infection. Using a genetic and chemical screen, we identified inhibitors that target IP pathway enzymes and are selective against T. brucei. Two series of these inhibitors acted on T. brucei inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) preventing Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 phosphorylation. We show that IPMK is functionally conserved among kinetoplastids and that its inhibition is also lethal for Trypanosoma cruzi. Hence, IP enzymes are viable drug targets in kinetoplastids, and IPMK inhibitors may aid the development of new drugs.

Abstract: It is well known that vitamin A and its receptors protect against cancer development and that Retinoid Acid Receptor β (RARβ) is epigenetically silenced during tumoral progression. Cervical Cancer (CC) has been causally linked to high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. However, host factors are important in determining the outcome of persistent HR-HPV infection as most cervical precancerous lesions containing HR-HPVs do not progress to invasive carcinomas. Increasing evidence suggests that low diet in vitamin A and their receptors participate in the development of CC. The aim of this study has been to investigate the effects of abated RARβ expression in the development of cervical premalignant lesions in 4 month-old conditional mice (RARβL−/L−). Results demonstrated the development of spontaneous squamous metaplasia, inflammatory infiltrate, enhanced mitotic activity, loss of cell differentiation, as well as decreased apoptosis and p16INK4a protein levels in RARβL−/L− mice cervix. All these changes are hallmarks of moderate dysplasia. Importantly, our results suggest that the low expression of RARβ, may induce the down regulation of p16INK4a, chronic inflammation and decreased apoptosis and may be involved in vulnerability to HR-HPV and early stage cervical carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Intestinal homeostasis is maintained by complex interactions between intestinal microorganisms and the gut immune system. Dysregulation of gut immunity may lead to inflammatory disorders and tumorigenesis. We previously have shown the tumor suppressive effects of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in intestinal carcinogenesis. In the present study, we investigated AhR distribution in the mouse and human intestine by histochemical analysis. In the normal intestine, AhR was mainly localized in the stroma containing immune cells in the lamina propria and lymphoid follicles. On the other hand, in the tumor tissue from human colon cancer and that developed in ApcMin/+mice, AhR expression was elevated. AhR immunostaining was found in both stromal and tumor cells. Although AhR was localized in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in most cases, nuclear AhR was also observed in some. AhR knockdown using siRNA resulted in significant promotion of cell growth in colon cancer cell lines. Furthermore, AhR activation by AhR ligands supplemented in culture medium suppressed cell growth. Our study results suggest that tumor suppressive roles of AhR are estimated in two distinct ways: in normal tissue, AhR is associated with tumor prevention by regulating gut immunity, whereas in tumor cells, it is involved in growth suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are fast proliferating cells capable of differentiating into all somatic cell types. In somatic cells, it is well documented that p53 is rapidly activated upon DNA damage to arrest the cell cycle and induce apoptosis. In mouse ESCs, p53 can also be functionally activated, but the precise biological consequences are not well characterized. Here, we demonstrated that doxorubicin treatment initially led to cell-cycle arrest at G2/M in ESCs, followed by the occurrence of massive apoptosis. Neither p53 nor its target gene p73 was required for G2/M arrest. Instead, p53 and p73 were fully responsible for apoptosis. p53 and p73 were also required for differentiation-induced apoptosis in mouse ESCs. In addition, doxorubicin treatment induced the expression of retinoblastoma protein in a p53-dependent manner. Therefore, both p53 and p73 are critical in apoptosis induced by DNA damage and differentiation.

Abstract: The objective of the present study was to develop an accurate and reproducible method for liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) isolation in mice. Non-parenchymal cells were isolated using a modified two-step collagenase digestion combined with Optiprep density gradient centrifugation. LSEC were further purified using two prevalent methods, short-term selective adherence and CD146+ magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), and compared in terms of cell yield, viability and purity to our purification technique using CD11b cell depletion combined with long-term selective adherence. LSEC purification using our technique allowed to obtain 7.07±3.80 million LSEC per liver, while CD146+ MACS and short-term selective adherence yielded 2.94±1.28 and 0.99±0.66 million LSEC, respectively. Purity of the final cell preparation reached 95.10±2.58% when using our method. In contrast, CD146+ MACS and short-term selective adherence gave purities of 86.75±3.26% and 47.95±9.82%, respectively. Similarly, contamination by non-LSEC was the lowest when purification was performed using our technique, with a proportion of contaminating macrophages of only 1.87±0.77%. Further, isolated cells analysed by scanning electron microscopy presented typical LSEC fenestrations organized in sieve plates, demonstrating that the technique allowed to isolate bona fide LSEC. In conclusion, we described a reliable and reproducible technique for the isolation of high yields of pure LSEC in mice. This protocol provides an efficient method to prepare LSEC for studying their biological functions.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide an unlimited cell source for regenerative medicine. Hormone-producing cells are particularly suitable for cell therapy, and hypopituitarism, a defect in pituitary gland function, represents a promising therapeutic target. Previous studies have derived pituitary lineages from mouse and human ESCs using 3D organoid cultures that mimic the complex events underlying pituitary gland development in vivo. Instead of relying on unknown cellular signals, we present a simple and efficient strategy to derive human pituitary lineages from hPSCs using monolayer culture conditions suitable for cell manufacturing. We demonstrate that purified placode cells can be directed into pituitary fates using defined signals. hPSC-derived pituitary cells show basal and stimulus-induced hormone release in vitro and engraftment and hormone release in vivo after transplantation into a murine model of hypopituitarism. This work lays the foundation for future cell therapy applications in patients with hypopituitarism.

Abstract: Changes in the levels of three structurally and functionally different important thermoprotectant molecules, namely small heat shock proteins (sHsps), trehalose, and lipids, have been investigated upon heat shock in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Both α-crystallin-type sHsps (Hsp15.8 and Hsp16) were induced after prolonged high-temperature treatment but with different kinetic profiles. The shsp null mutants display a weak, but significant, heat sensitivity indicating their importance in the thermal stress management. The heat induction of sHsps is different in wild type and in highly heat-sensitive trehalose-deficient (tps1Δ) cells; however, trehalose level did not show significant alteration in shsp mutants. The altered timing of trehalose accumulation and induction of sHsps suggest that the disaccharide might provide protection at the early stage of the heat stress while elevated amount of sHsps are required at the later phase. The cellular lipid compositions of two different temperature-adapted wild-type S. pombe cells are also altered according to the rule of homeoviscous adaptation, indicating their crucial role in adapting to the environmental temperature changes. Both Hsp15.8 and Hsp16 are able to bind to different lipids isolated from S. pombe, whose interaction might provide a powerful protection against heat-induced damages of the membranes. Our data suggest that all the three investigated thermoprotectant macromolecules play a pivotal role during the thermal stress management in the fission yeast.

Abstract: Summary
Developing a model of primate neural tube (NT) development is important to promote many NT disorder studies in model organisms. Here, we report a robust and stable system to allow for clonal expansion of single monkey neuroepithelial stem cells (NESCs) to develop into miniature NT-like structures. Single NESCs can produce functional neurons in vitro, survive, and extensively regenerate neuron axons in monkey brain. NT formation and NESC maintenance depend on high metabolism activity and Wnt signaling. NESCs are regionally restricted to a telencephalic fate. Moreover, single NESCs can turn into radial glial progenitors (RGPCs). The transition is accurately regulated by Wnt signaling through regulation of Notch signaling and adhesion molecules. Finally, using the “NESC-TO-NTs” system, we model the functions of folic acid (FA) on NT closure and demonstrate that FA can regulate multiple mechanisms to prevent NT defects. Our system is ideal for studying NT development and diseases.

Metformin activation of AMPK-dependent pathways is neuroprotective in human neural stem cells against Amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction,

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the general consequence of dementia and is diagnostic neuropathology by the cumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein aggregates, which are thought to promote mitochondrial dysfunction processes leading to neurodegeneration. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical regulator of energy homeostasis and a major player in lipid and glucose metabolism, is potentially implied in the mitochondrial deficiency of AD. Metformin, one of the widespread used anti- metabolic disease drugs, use its actions in part by stimulation of AMPK. While the mechanisms of AD are well established, the neuronal roles for AMPK in AD are still not well understood. In the present study, human neural stem cells (hNSCs) exposed to Aβ had significantly reduced cell viability, which correlated with decreased AMPK, neuroprotective genes (Bcl-2 and CREB) and mitochondria associated genes (PGC1α, NRF-1 and Tfam) expressions, as well as increased activation of caspase 3/9 activity and cytosolic cytochrome c. Co-treatment with metformin distinct abolished the Aβ-caused actions in hNSCs. Metformin also significantly rescued hNSCs from Aβ-mediated mitochondrial deficiency (lower D-loop level, mitochondrial mass, maximal respiratory function, COX activity, and mitochondrial membrane potential). Importantly, co-treatment with metformin significantly restored fragmented mitochondria to almost normal morphology in the hNSCs with Aβ. These findings extend our understanding of the central role of AMPK in Aβ-related neuronal impairment. Thus, a better understanding of AMPK might assist in both the recognition of its critical effects and the implementation of new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of AD.

Abstract: GADD34 is a member of a growth arrest and DNA damage (GADD)-inducible gene family. Here, we established a novel Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1-derived cell line, CHO-K1-G34M, which carries a nonsense mutation (termed the Q525X mutation) in the GADD34 gene. The Q525X mutant protein lacks the C-terminal 66 amino acids required for GADD34 to bind to and activate protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). We investigated the effects of GADD34 with or without the Q525X mutation on the phosphorylation status of PP1 target proteins, including the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). CHO-K1-G34M cells had higher levels of eIF2α phosphorylation compared to the control CHO-K1-normal cells both in the presence and absence of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Overexpression of the wild-type GADD34 protein in CHO-K1-normal cells largely reduced eIF2α phosphorylation, while overexpression of the Q525X mutant did not produce similar reductions. Meanwhile, neither wild type nor Q525X mutation of GADD34 affected the GSK3β phosphorylation status. GADD34 also did not affect the canonical Wnt signaling pathway downstream of GSK3β. Cell proliferation rates were higher, while expression levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 were lower in CHO-K1-G34M cells compared to the CHO-K1-normal cells. The GADD34 Q525X mutant had a reduced ability to inhibit cell proliferation and enhance p21 expression of the CHO-K1-normal cells compared to the wild-type GADD34 protein. These results suggest that the GADD34 protein C-terminal plays important roles in regulating not only eIF2α dephosphorylation but also cell proliferation in CHO-K1 cells.

Abstract: Summary
The transition from replication to non-replication underlies much of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenesis, as non- or slowly replicating Mtb are responsible for persistence and poor treatment outcomes. Therapeutic targeting of non-replicating populations is a priority for tuberculosis treatment, but few drug targets in non-replicating Mtb are currently known. Here, we directly measured the activity of the highly diverse and druggable serine hydrolases (SHs) during active replication and non-replication using activity-based proteomics. We predict SH activity for 78 proteins, including 27 proteins with unknown function, and identify 37 SHs that remain active in the absence of replication, providing a set of candidate persistence targets. Non-replication was associated with major shifts in SH activity. These activity changes were largely independent of SH abundance, indicating extensive post-translational regulation of SHs. By probing a large cross-section of druggable Mtb enzyme space during replication and non-replication, we identify new SHs and suggest new persistence targets.

Abstract: Zebrafish as a model system have been instrumental in understanding early vertebrate development, especially of the hematopoietic system. The external development of zebrafish and their genetic amenability have allowed in-depth studies of multiple blood cell types and their respective genetic regulation. This chapter highlights some new data in zebrafish hematopoiesis regarding primitive and definitive hematopoiesis in the embryonic and adult fish, allowing the isolation of prospective progenitor subsets. It also highlights assays developed to examine the function of these progenitors in vivo and in vitro, allowing an evolutionary understanding of the hematopoietic system and how zebrafish can be better utilized as a model system for a multitude of hematopoietic disorders.

Abstract: Embryos of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, are genetically programmed to develop either ovoviparously or oviparously depending on environmental conditions. Shortly upon their release from the female, oviparous embryos enter diapause during which time they undergo major metabolic rate depression while simultaneously synthesize proteins that permit them to tolerate a wide range of stressful environmental events including prolonged periods of desiccation, freezing, and anoxia. Among the known stress-related proteins that accumulate in embryos entering diapause are the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins. This large group of intrinsically disordered proteins has been proposed to act as molecular shields or chaperones of macromolecules which are otherwise intolerant to harsh conditions associated with diapause. In this research, we used two model systems to study the potential function of the group 1 LEA proteins from Artemia. Expression of the Artemia group 1 gene (AfrLEA-1) in Escherichia coli inhibited growth in proportion to the number of 20-mer amino acid motifs expressed. As well, clones of E. coli, transformed with the AfrLEA-1 gene, expressed multiple bands of LEA proteins, either intrinsically or upon induction with isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside (IPTG), in a vector-specific manner. Expression of AfrLEA-1 in E. coli did not overcome the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of NaCl and KCl but modulated growth inhibition resulting from high concentrations of sorbitol in the growth medium. In contrast, expression of the AfrLEA-1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not alter the growth kinetics or permit yeast to tolerate high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, or sorbitol. However, expression of AfrLEA-1 in yeast improved its tolerance to drying (desiccation) and freezing. Under our experimental conditions, both E. coli and S. cerevisiae appear to be potentially suitable hosts to study the function of Artemia group 1 LEA proteins under environmentally stressful conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp90 belongs to a family of some of the most highly expressed heat shock proteins that function as molecular chaperones to protect the proteome not only from the heat shock but also from other misfolding events. As many client proteins of Hsp90 are involved in oncogenesis, this chaperone has been the focus of intense research efforts. Yet, we lack structural information for how Hsp90 interacts with co-chaperones and client proteins. Here, we developed a mass-spectrometry-based approach that allowed quantitative measurements of in vitro and in vivo effects of small-molecule inhibitors on Hsp90 conformation, and interaction with co-chaperones and client proteins. From this analysis, we were able to derive structural models for how Hsp90 engages its interaction partners in vivo, and how different drugs affect these structures. In addition, the methodology described here offers a new approach to probe the effects of virtually any inhibitor treatment on the proteome level.

Abstract: The Rab11 family of small GTPases, along with the Rab11-family interacting proteins (Rab11-FIPs), are critical regulators of intracellular vesicle trafficking and recycling. We have identified a point mutation of Threonine-197 site to an Alanine in Rab11-FIP1A, which causes a dramatic dominant negative phenotype when expressed in HeLa cells. The normally perinuclear distribution of GFP-Rab11-FIP1A was condensed into a membranous cisternum with almost no GFP-Rab11-FIP1A(T197A) remaining outside of this central locus. Also, this condensed GFP-FIP1A(T197A) altered the distribution of proteins in the Rab11a recycling pathway including endogenous Rab11a, Rab11-FIP1C, and transferrin receptor (CD71). Furthermore, this condensed GFP-FIP1A(T197A)-containing structure exhibited little movement in live HeLa cells. Expression of GFP-FIP1A(T197A) caused a strong blockade of transferrin recycling. Treatment of cells expressing GFP-FIP1A(T197A) with nocodazole did not disperse the Rab11a-containing recycling system. We also found that Rab5 and EEA1 were accumulated in membranes by GFP-Rab11-FIP1A but Rab4 was unaffected, suggesting that a direct pathway may exist from early endosomes into the Rab11a-containing recycling system. Our study of a potent inhibitory trafficking mutation in Rab11-FIP1A shows that Rab11-FIP1A associates with and regulates trafficking at an early step in the process of membrane recycling.

Abstract: Scientists in the UK have mapped the movement of charge through a metal organic framework (MOF) material, using a combination of X-ray and neutron techniques. Their improved understanding of the mechanism behind the flow of charge in MOFs is hoped to lead to the design of more efficient fuel cells in the future.

Abstract: Stromal fibroblasts have an important role in regulating tumor progression. Normal and quiescent fibroblasts have been shown to restrict and control cancer cell growth, while cancer-associated, i. e. activated fibroblasts have been shown to enhance proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells. In this study we describe generation of quiescent fibroblasts in multicellular spheroids and their effects on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) growth in soft-agarose and xenograft models. Quiescent phenotype of fibroblasts was determined by global down-regulation of expression of genes related to cell cycle and increased expression of p27. Interestingly, microarray analysis showed that fibroblast quiescence was associated with similar secretory phenotype as seen in senescence and they expressed senescence-associated-β-galactosidase. Quiescent fibroblasts spheroids also restricted the growth of RT3 SCC cells both in soft-agarose and xenograft models unlike proliferating fibroblasts. Restricted tumor growth was associated with marginally increased tumor cell senescence and cellular differentiation, showed with senescence-associated-β-galactosidase and cytokeratin 7 staining. Our results show that the fibroblasts spheroids can be used as a model to study cellular quiescence and their effects on cancer cell progression.

Abstract: Summary
Defining the molecular regulators of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) requires in vivo functional analyses. Competitive bone marrow transplants (BMTs) compare control and test HSPCs to demonstrate the functional role of a genetic change or chemical perturbation. Competitive BMT is enabled by antibodies that specifically recognize hematopoietic cells from congenic mouse strains due to variants of the cell surface protein CD45, designated CD45.1 and CD45.2. The current congenic competitor strain, B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (CD45.1), has a substantial inherent disadvantage in competition against the C57BL/6 (CD45.2) strain, confounding experimental interpretation. Despite backcrossing, the congenic interval over which the B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ strain differs is almost 40 Mb encoding ∼300 genes. Here, we demonstrate that a single amino acid change determines the CD45.1 epitope. Further, we report on the single targeted exon mutant (STEM) mouse strain, CD45.1STEM, which is functionally equivalent to CD45.2 cells in competitive BMT. This strain will permit the precise definition of functional roles for candidate genes using in vivo HSPC assays.

Abstract: Human prostate cancer (PCa) is a highly heterogeneous and multifactorial disease. Current clinical biomarkers are not sufficiently accurate, thus being unable to predict the clinical outcome. Therefore, searching for new biomarkers aiming to improve diagnosis, prognosis and therapy is still required. In this study, we performed 3D Cell-SELEX against PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, a novel strategy to select specific nucleic acid ligands against spheroid cells in 3D cell culture. This original system combines Cell-SELEX, a process that exploits the cellular structure to generate specific ligands, and 3D cell culture, an approach that mimics the tissue microenvironment in vitro. In the first round of 3D Cell-SELEX, a negative selection against RWPE-1, non-tumor cell line, was performed to subtract non-tumor specific aptamers. The supernatant was used in eight additional rounds of selection, which were performed against PC-3 cell line. After nine selection cycles, eight PC-3 specific RNA aptamers were selected and sequenced. The aptamers presented sizes between 20 and 50 nucleotides-long, with low free energy (∆G<−13.6), which contributed for their spontaneous folding and high stability. Furthermore, our results showed the aptamer A4 as a specific ligand to prostate tumor cells, with dissociation constant in the nanomolar scale. Therefore, the novel 3D Cell-SELEX procedure improved the selection of PCa cell-surface ligands and the aptamer A4 has shown potential for the identification of prostate tumor cells, suggesting the application of this molecule in further screening assays for PCa.

Abstract: Summary
The SPI-2 type III secretion system (T3SS) of intracellular Salmonella enterica translocates effector proteins into mammalian cells. Infection of antigen-presenting cells results in SPI-2 T3SS-dependent ubiquitination and reduction of surface-localized mature MHC class II (mMHCII). We identify the effector SteD as required and sufficient for this process. In Mel Juso cells, SteD localized to the Golgi network and vesicles containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 and mMHCII. SteD caused MARCH8-dependent ubiquitination and depletion of surface mMHCII. One of two transmembrane domains and the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of SteD mediated binding to MARCH8 and mMHCII, respectively. Infection of dendritic cells resulted in SteD-dependent depletion of surface MHCII, the co-stimulatory molecule B7.2, and suppression of T cell activation. SteD also accounted for suppression of T cell activation during Salmonella infection of mice. We propose that SteD is an adaptor, forcing inappropriate ubiquitination of mMHCII by MARCH8 and thereby suppressing T cell activation.

Abstract: G9a is one of the histone H3 Lys 9 (H3K9) specific methyltransferases first identified in mammals. Drosophila G9a (dG9a) has been reported to induce H3K9 dimethylation in vivo, and the target genes of dG9a were identified during embryonic and larval stages. Although dG9a is important for a variety of developmental processes, the link between dG9a and signaling pathways are not addressed yet. Here, by genome-wide genetic screen, taking advantage of the rough eye phenotype of flies that over-express dG9a in eye discs, we identified 16 genes that enhanced the rough eye phenotype induced by dG9a over-expression. These 16 genes included Star, anterior open, bereft and F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 6 which are components of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway. When dG9a over-expression was combined with mutation of Star, differentiation of R7 photoreceptors in eye imaginal discs as well as cone cells and pigment cells in pupal retinae was severely inhibited. Furthermore, the dG9a over-expression reduced the activated ERK signals in eye discs. These data demonstrate a strong genetic link between dG9a and the EGFR signaling pathway.

Abstract: X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is required for dosage compensation of X-linked genes in human female cells. Several previous reports have described the promiscuous XCI status in long-term cultured female human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and the majority of them exhibit non-random XCI. However, when and how such female hESCs acquire the aberrant XCI states during culture is unknown. Herein, through comparing the XCI states in 18 paired hES cell lines throughout early culture, we revealed a uniform dynamic change during this culture period under a widely used culture condition. The female initial hESCs (ihESCs, P4-P9) expressed XIST RNA, H3K27me3 punctate enrichment and displayed random XCI pattern. By further culturing, the female early hESCs (ehESCs, P20–P30) lost the expression of XIST RNA, H3K27me3 punctate enrichment and exhibited a completely skewed XCI pattern. Importantly, a subset of X-linked genes was up-regulated in ehESCs, including some cancer-related genes. At last, we found 5% physiological oxygen was beneficial for the expression of XIST and H3K27me3 punctate enrichment, but not for the XCI pattern. We conclude that the XCI dynamic change is a frequent epigenetic instability event during early culture, which is accompanied by the up-regulation of some X-linked genes. Furthermore, we emphasize that physiological oxygen is beneficial for XCI fidelity.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular proliferation requires the formation of new membranes. It is often assumed that the lipids needed for these membranes are synthesized mostly de novo. Here, we show that proliferating fibroblasts prefer to take up palmitate from the extracellular environment over synthesizing it de novo. Relative to quiescent fibroblasts, proliferating fibroblasts increase their uptake of palmitate, decrease fatty acid degradation, and instead direct more palmitate to membrane lipids. When exogenous palmitate is provided in the culture media at physiological concentrations, de novo synthesis accounts for only a minor fraction of intracellular palmitate in proliferating fibroblasts as well as proliferating HeLa and H460 cells. Blocking fatty acid uptake decreased the proliferation rate of fibroblasts, HeLa, and H460 cells, while supplementing media with exogenous palmitate resulted in decreased glucose uptake and rendered cells less sensitive to glycolytic inhibition. Our results suggest that cells scavenging exogenous lipids may be less susceptible to drugs targeting glycolysis and de novo lipid synthesis.

Abstract: Studies on the role of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) on tumor growth have reported both a tumor promoting and a suppressive effect. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of MSC isolated from Wharton's jelly of umbilical cord (WJMSC) on lung cancer stem cells (LCSC) derived from human lung tumors: two adenocarcinomas (AC) and two squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). LCSC derived from SCC and AC expressed, to varying extents, the more relevant stem cell markers. The effect of WJMSC on LCSC was investigated in vitro using conditioned medium (WJ-CM): a proliferation increase in AC-LCSC was observed, with an increase in the ALDH+ and in the CD133+ cell population. By contrast, WJ-CM hampered the growth of SCC-LCSC, with an increase in the pre-G1 phase indicating the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, the ALDH+ and CD133+ population was also reduced. In vivo, subcutaneous co-transplantation of AC-LCSC/WJMSC generated larger tumors than AC-LCSC alone, characterized by an increased percentage of CD133+ and CD166+ cells. By contrast, co-transplantation of WJMSC and SCC-LCSC did not affect the tumor size. Our results strongly suggest that WJMSC exert, both in vitro and in vivo, contrasting effects on LCSC derived from different lung tumor subtypes.

Abstract: Glutamate-induced neurotoxicity involves in overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress. Our previous data demonstrated that asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, has a protective effect against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third endogenous gaseous mediator, has potential therapeutic value for oxidative stress-induced neural damage. Therefore, we hypothesized that ADMA provides protection against the neurotoxicity of glutamate by regulating endogenous H2S generation. In the present study, we found that ADMA prevented glutamate-triggered decrease in endogenous H2S generation in PC12 cells and reversed glutamate-induced suppression in the expression and activity of cystathionine-β-synthetase (CBS), the predominant enzymatic source of H2S in PC12 cells. Furthermore, AOAA, a potent inhibitor of CBS, significantly abolished the protective action of ADMA against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity to PC12 cells. We also showed that ADMA suppressed glutamate-elicited NOS excessive activation and NO overproduction in PC12 cells. These data indicate that the protection of ADMA against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity is by promoting endogenous H2S generation, resulting from suppression in NOS excessive activation and NO overproduction. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying the protection of ADMA against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.

Abstract: Inositol polyphosphates represent a group of differentially phosphorylated inositol metabolites, many of which are implicated to regulate diverse cellular processes such as calcium mobilization, vesicular trafficking, differentiation, apoptosis, etc. The metabolic network of these compounds is complex and tightly regulated by various kinases and phosphatases present predominantly in the cytosol. Multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 1 (Minpp1) is the only known endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal enzyme that hydrolyzes various inositol polyphosphates in vitro as well as in vivo conditions. However, access of the Minpp1 to cytosolic substrates has not yet been demonstrated clearly and hence its physiological function. In this study, we examined a potential role for Minpp1 in ER stress-induced apoptosis. We generated a custom antibody and characterized its specificity to study the expression of Minpp1 protein in multiple mammalian cells under experimentally induced cellular stress conditions. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in the expression of Minpp1 in response to a variety of cellular stress conditions. The protein expression was corroborated with the expression of its mRNA and enzymatic activity. Further, in an attempt to link the role of Minpp1 to apoptotic stress, we studied the effect of Minpp1 expression on apoptosis following silencing of the Minpp1 gene by its specific siRNA. Our results suggest an attenuation of apoptotic parameters following knockdown of Minpp1. Thus, in addition to its known role in inositol polyphosphate metabolism, we have identified a novel role for Minpp1 as a stress-responsive protein. In summary, our results provide, for the first time, a probable link between ER stress-induced apoptosis and Minpp1 expression.

Abstract: Heteromeric complexes of GTP-binding proteins from the septin family assemble into higher order structures that are essential for cell division in many organisms. The correct organization of the subunits into filaments, gauzes, and rings is the basis of septin function in this process. Electron microscopy and polarization fluorescence microscopy contributed greatly to the understanding of the dynamics and organization of such structures. However, both methods show technical limitations in resolution and specificity that do not allow the identification of individual septin complexes in assemblies in intact cells. Single-molecule localization-based fluorescence superresolution microscopy methods combine the resolution of cellular structures at the nanometer level with highest molecular specificity and excellent contrast. Here, we provide a protocol that enables the investigation of the organization of septin complexes in higher order structures in cells by combining advantageous features of the model organism Ashbya gossypii with single-molecule localization microscopy. Our assay is designed to investigate the general assembly mechanism of septin complexes in cells and is applicable to many cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Apicomplexa exhibit a unique form of substrate-dependent gliding motility central for host cell invasion and parasite dissemination. Gliding is powered by rearward translocation of apically secreted transmembrane adhesins via their interaction with the parasite actomyosin system. We report a conserved armadillo and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing protein, termed glideosome-associated connector (GAC), that mediates apicomplexan gliding motility, invasion, and egress by connecting the micronemal adhesins with the actomyosin system. TgGAC binds to and stabilizes filamentous actin and specifically associates with the transmembrane adhesin TgMIC2. GAC localizes to the apical pole in invasive stages of Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium berghei, and apical positioning of TgGAC depends on an apical lysine methyltransferase, TgAKMT. GAC PH domain also binds to phosphatidic acid, a lipid mediator associated with microneme exocytosis. Collectively, these findings indicate a central role for GAC in spatially and temporally coordinating gliding motility and invasion.

Abstract: Diabetic cardiomyopathy increases the risk for the development of heart failure independent of coronary artery disease and hypertension. Either type 1 or type 2 diabetes is often accompanied by varying degrees of hyperglycemia, which has been proven to induce myocardial apoptosis in animal models. Recently, a novel small molecule, ZLN005, has been reported to show antidiabetic efficacy in a mouse model, possibly by induction of PGC-1α expression. In this study, we investigated whether ZLN005 protects cardiomyocytes against high glucose-induced cytotoxicity and the mechanisms involved. Neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were incubated with media containing 5.5 or 33mM glucose for 24h in the presence or absence of ZLN005. ZLN005 treatment led to ameliorated cardiomyocyte oxidative injury, enhanced cell viability, and reduced apoptosis in the high glucose environment. Western blot analysis revealed that high glucose suppressed cardiomyocyte autophagy, whereas ZLN005 increased the expression of autophagy marker proteins ATG5, beclin1, and LC3 II/LC3 I; this increase was accompanied by increased expression of SIRT1. Furthermore, EX527, a SIRT1-specific inhibitor, weakened the protective effects of ZLN005 on cardiomyocytes subjected to high glucose. Taken together, these results suggest that ZLN005 suppresses high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte injury by promoting SIRT1 expression and autophagy.

Abstract: Correct neuronal migration is crucial for the brain architecture and function. During brain development, excitatory and inhibitory neurons generated in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the dorsal telencephalon and ganglionic medial eminence, respectively, move to their final destinations in tightly regulated spatiotemporal manners. While a variety of morphological methods have been applied to neurobiology, in utero electroporation (IUE) technique is one of the most powerful tools for rapid gain- and loss-of-function studies of brain development. This method enables us to introduce genes of interest into VZ progenitor and stem cells of rodent embryos, and to observe resulting phenotypes such as proliferation, migration, and cell morphology at later stages. In this chapter, we first summarize basic immunohistochemistry methods that are foundations for any advanced methods and showed data on the distribution of Sept6, Sept9, and Sept14 as examples. Then, IUE method is described where functional analyses of Sept14 during brain development are used as examples. We subsequently refer to the in vivo electroporation (IVE)-mediated gene transfer, which is conceptually the same method as IUE, into granule cells of hippocampal dentate gyrus in neonatal mice. Finally, an IUE-based time-lapse imaging method is explained as an advanced technique for the analyses of cortical neuron migration. IUE and IVE methods and the application would contribute greatly to the morphological analyses of septins as well as other molecules to elucidate their neuronal functions and pathophysiological roles in various neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction is considered to be the main manifestation in the pathology of ischemia reperfusion injury, and by restoring its functional activity, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a novel endogenous gaseotransmitter renders cardioprotection. Given that interfibrillar (IFM) and subsarcolemmal (SSM) mitochondria are the two main types in the heart, the present study investigates the specific H2S-mediated action on IFM and SSM during ischemic reperfusion in the Langendorff rat heart model. Rats were randomly divided into five groups, namely normal, ischemic control, reperfusion control (I/R), ischemic post-conditioning (POC), and H2S post-conditioning (POC_H2S). In reperfusion control, cardiac contractility decreased, and lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and infracted size increased compared to both normal and ischemic group. In hearts post-conditioned with H2S and the classical method improved cardiac mechanical function and decreased cardiac markers in the perfusate and infarct size significantly. Both POC and POC_H2S exerts its cardioprotective effect of preserving the IFM, as evident by significant improvement in electron transport chain enzyme activities and mitochondrial respiration. The in vitro action of H2S on IFM and SSM from normal and I/R rat heart supports H2S and mediates cardioprotection via IFM preservation. Our study indicates that IFM play an important role in POC_H2S mediated cardioprotection from reperfusion injury.

Abstract: Summary
Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), a leading cause of genital herpes, infects oral or genital mucosal epithelial cells before infecting the peripheral sensory nervous system. The spread of HSV-1 beyond the sensory nervous system and the resulting broader spectrum of disease are not well understood. Using a mouse model of genital herpes, we found that HSV-1-infection-associated lethality correlated with severe fecal and urinary retention. No inflammation or infection of the brain was evident. Instead, HSV-1 spread via the dorsal root ganglia to the autonomic ganglia of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in the colon. ENS infection led to robust viral gene transcription, pathological inflammatory responses, and neutrophil-mediated destruction of enteric neurons, ultimately resulting in permanent loss of peristalsis and the development of toxic megacolon. Laxative treatment rescued mice from lethality following genital HSV-1 infection. These results reveal an unexpected pathogenesis of HSV associated with ENS infection.

Abstract: Summary
The discovery of novel small molecules that induce stem cell reprogramming and give efficient access to pluripotent stem cells is of major importance for potential therapeutic applications and may reveal novel insights into the factors controlling pluripotency. Chemical reprogramming of mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) into cells corresponding to embryonic stem cells (cESCs) is an inefficient process. In order to identify small molecules that promote this cellular transition, we analyzed the LOPAC library in a phenotypic screen monitoring Oct4-GFP expression and identified triamterene (TR) as initial hit. Synthesis of a TR-derived compound collection and investigation for reprogramming of EpiSCs into cESCs identified casein kinases 1 (CK1) α/δ/ɛ as responsible cellular targets of TR and unraveled the structural parameters that determine reprogramming. Delineation of a structure-activity relationship led to the development of Epiblastin A, which engages CK1 isoenzymes in cell lysate and induces efficient conversion of EpiSCs into cESCs.

Abstract: Extensive membrane blebbing is one of the earliest observable changes in HeLa cells stimulated with apoptosis inducers. Blebbing caused by actinomycin D or camptothecin, but not by anti-Fas antibody, is accompanied by an almost 10% volume increase as measured by transmission-through-dye microscopy. When the experiment is carried out in DMEM medium, the swelling appears to result from activation of amiloride-sensitive channels. Low-sodium choline-, but not N-methyl−D-glucamine-based, medium, also supports swelling during the blebbing phase of apoptosis; this indicates that the membrane becomes permeable to choline as well. Because choline can enter the cells through organic cation transporters (OCT), we tested three fluorescent dyes (2-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]-1-methylpyridinium iodide, rhodamine 123 and ethidium bromide) that have been reported to utilize OCT for cell entry. Intact HeLa cells are poorly permeable for these fluorophores, and initially they accumulate on the plasma membranes. Blebbing results in an enhanced penetration of these dyes into the cell interior, as was demonstrated both by direct observation and by FRET. The increased membrane permeability is specific for OCT substrates; the other tested cationic dyes apparently cross the membrane by other routes and exhibit a markedly different behavior. Our results reveal a previously unknown feature of apoptosis and the utility of cationic dyes for studying membrane transport.

Abstract: Summary
Trypanosoma brucei is an extracellular parasite that causes sleeping sickness. In mammalian hosts, trypanosomes are thought to exist in two major niches: early in infection, they populate the blood; later, they breach the blood-brain barrier. Working with a well-established mouse model, we discovered that adipose tissue constitutes a third major reservoir for T. brucei. Parasites from adipose tissue, here termed adipose tissue forms (ATFs), can replicate and were capable of infecting a naive animal. ATFs were transcriptionally distinct from bloodstream forms, and the genes upregulated included putative fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes. Consistent with this, ATFs were able to utilize exogenous myristate and form β-oxidation intermediates, suggesting that ATF parasites can use fatty acids as an external carbon source. These findings identify the adipose tissue as a niche for T. brucei during its mammalian life cycle and could potentially explain the weight loss associated with sleeping sickness.

Abstract: Huntingtin interacting protein HYPK (Huntingtin Yeast Partner K) is an intrinsically unstructured protein having chaperone-like activity and can suppress mutant huntingtin aggregates and toxicity in cell model of Huntington's Disease (HD). Heat shock response is an adaptive mechanism of cells characterized by upregulation of heat shock proteins by heat-induced activation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). The trans-activation ability of HSF1 is arrested upon restoration of proteostasis. We earlier identified HYPK as a heat-inducible protein and transcriptional target of HSF1. Here we show that HYPK can act as negative regulator of heat shock response by repressing transcriptional activity of HSF1. As part of its role as a repressor of heat shock response, HYPK can also inhibit HSF1-dependent trans-activation of its own promoter. HYPK is downregulated in cell and animal model of HD. We further show that transcriptional downregulation of HYPK in HD cell model is a consequence of reduced occupancy of HSF1 in HYPK promoter. Moreover, presence of mutant huntingtin inhibits effective induction of HYPK in response to heat shock. Taken together, our findings reveal that HYPK can suppress heat shock response via an autoregulatory loop and downregulation of HYPK in HD is caused by impaired transcriptional activity of HSF1 in presence of mutant huntingtin.

Abstract: Summary
Covalent addition of a methyl group to adenosine N6 (m6A) is an evolutionarily conserved and common RNA modification that is thought to modulate several aspects of RNA metabolism. While the presence of multiple m6A editing sites on diverse viral RNAs was reported starting almost 40 years ago, how m6A editing affects virus replication has remained unclear. Here, we used photo-crosslinking-assisted m6A sequencing techniques to precisely map several m6A editing sites on the HIV-1 genome and report that they cluster in the HIV-1 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR). Viral 3′ UTR m6A sites or analogous cellular m6A sites strongly enhanced mRNA expression in cis by recruiting the cellular YTHDF m6A “reader” proteins. Reducing YTHDF expression inhibited, while YTHDF overexpression enhanced, HIV-1 protein and RNA expression, and virus replication in CD4+ T cells. These data identify m6A editing and the resultant recruitment of YTHDF proteins as major positive regulators of HIV-1 mRNA expression.

Abstract: Summary
Primordial germ cell (PGC) specification occurs early in development. PGC specifiers have been identified in Drosophila, mouse, and human but remained elusive in most animals. Here we identify the RNA-binding protein Dnd as a critical PGC specifier in the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). Dnd depletion specifically abolished PGCs, and its overexpression boosted PGCs. We established a single-cell culture procedure enabling lineage tracing in vitro. We show that individual blastomeres from cleavage embryos at the 32- and 64-cell stages are capable of PGC production in culture. Importantly, Dnd overexpression increases PGCs via increasing PGC precursors. Strikingly, dnd RNA forms prominent particles that segregate asymmetrically. Dnd concentrates in germ plasm and stabilizes germ plasm RNA. Therefore, Dnd is a critical specifier of fish PGCs and utilizes particle partition as a previously unidentified mechanism for asymmetric segregation. These findings offer insights into PGC specification and manipulation in medaka as a lower vertebrate model.

Abstract: The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system is a powerful tool for genome editing in numerous organisms. However, the system is typically used for gene editing throughout the entire organism. Tissue and temporal specific mutagenesis is often desirable to determine gene function in a specific stage or tissue and to bypass undesired consequences of global mutations. We have developed the CRISPR/Cas system for conditional mutagenesis in transgenic zebrafish using tissue-specific and/or inducible expression of Cas9 and U6-driven expression of sgRNA. To allow mutagenesis of multiple targets, we have isolated four distinct U6 promoters and designed Golden Gate vectors to easily assemble transgenes with multiple sgRNAs. We provide experimental details on the reagents and applications for multiplex conditional mutagenesis in zebrafish.

Abstract: Generating human podocytes in vitro could offer a unique opportunity to study human diseases. Here, we describe a simple and efficient protocol for obtaining functional podocytes in vitro from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Cells were exposed to a three-step protocol, which induced their differentiation into intermediate mesoderm, then into nephron progenitors and, finally, into mature podocytes. After differentiation, cells expressed the main podocyte markers, such as synaptopodin, WT1, α-Actinin-4, P-cadherin and nephrin at the protein and mRNA level, and showed the low proliferation rate typical of mature podocytes. Exposure to Angiotensin II significantly decreased the expression of podocyte genes and cells underwent cytoskeleton rearrangement. Cells were able to internalize albumin and self-assembled into chimeric 3D structures in combination with dissociated embryonic mouse kidney cells. Overall, these findings demonstrate the establishment of a robust protocol that, mimicking developmental stages, makes it possible to derive functional podocytes in vitro.

Abstract: Neurofilaments, which are the intermediate filaments of nerve cells, are space-filling cytoskeletal polymers that contribute to the growth of axonal caliber. In addition to their structural role, neurofilaments are cargos of axonal transport that move along microtubule tracks in a rapid, intermittent, and bidirectional manner. Though they measure just 10nm in diameter, which is well below the diffraction limit of optical microscopes, these polymers can reach 100μm or more in length and are often packed densely, just tens of nanometers apart. These properties of neurofilaments present unique challenges for studies on their movement. In this article, we describe several live-cell fluorescence imaging strategies that we have developed to image neurofilament transport in axons of cultured neurons on short and long timescales. Together, these methods form a powerful set of complementary tools with which to study the axonal transport of these unique intracellular cargos.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are a class of chaperones with low molecular weight, feathered by a C-terminal α-crystallin domain (ACD). They participate in reestablishing the stability of partially denatured proteins and therefore contribute to cellular homeostasis. In this work, we identified a sHsp homolog (designated as sHsp19) from Haliotis discus hannai, an economically important farmed mollusk in East Asia. sHsp19 possesses a sHsp hallmark domain, which exhibits the typical fold of ACD as revealed by a three-dimensional model constructed through an iterative threading assembly refinement method. The amino acid sequence sHsp19 shares low identities with any other known sHsps, with percentages below 35 %. Besides, sHsp19 shows relatively distant phylogenetic relationships with sHsps of various mollusks, including two other identified sHsps of abalone subspecies. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of sHsp19 occurred in multiple tissues. Upon exposure to thermal, oxidative, and multiple toxic metal stresses, the level of sHsp19 mRNA was rapidly elevated in a persistent fashion, with the maximum increase up to 170.58-, 405.84-, and 361.96-fold, respectively. These results indicate sHsp is a novel sHsp that possesses the distinguishing structural feature of sHsps but has remote homologies with known sHsps. It is likely to be important in stress adaptation of abalone and may be applied as a bioindicator for monitoring pollution or detrimental changes of environment in abalone culture.

Abstract: Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACi) has emerged as a promising approach in the treatment of many types of cancer, including leukemias. Among the HDACs, Class III HDACs, also known as sirtuins (SIRTs), are unique in that their function is directly related to the cell's metabolic state through their dependency on the co-factor NAD+. In this study, we examined the relation between SIRTs and the growth, survival, and differentiation of K562 erythroleukemia cells. Using a mass spectrometry approach we previously developed, we show that SIRT expression and deacetylase activity in these cells changes greatly with differentiation state (undifferentiated vs. megakaryocytic differentiation vs. erythroid differentiation). Moreover, SIRT1 is crucially involved in regulating the differentiation state. Overexpression of wildtype (but not deacetylase mutant) SIRT1 resulted in upregulation of glycophorin A, ~2-fold increase in the mRNA levels of α, γ, ε, and ζ-globins, and spontaneous hemoglobinization. Hemin-induced differentiation was also enhanced by (and depended on) higher SIRT1 levels. Since K562 cells are bipotent, we also investigated whether SIRT1 modulation affected their ability to undergo megakaryocytic (MK) differentiation. SIRT1 was required for commitment to the MK lineage and subsequent maturation, but was not directly involved in polyploidization of either K562 cells or an already-MK-committed cell line, CHRF-288–11. The observed blockage in commitment to the MK lineage was associated with a dramatic decrease in the formation of autophagic vacuoles, which was previously shown to be required for K562 cell MK commitment. Autophagy-associated conversion of the protein LC3-I to LC3-II was greatly enhanced by overexpression of wildtype SIRT1, further suggesting a functional connection between SIRT1, autophagy, and MK differentiation. Based on its clear effects on autophagy, we also examined the effect of SIRT1 modulation on stress responses. Consistent with results of prior studies, we found that SIRT1 silencing modestly promoted drug-induced apoptosis, while overexpression was protective. Furthermore, pan-SIRT inhibition mediated by nicotinamide pre-treatment substantially increased imatinib-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our results suggest a complex role for SIRT1 in regulating many aspects of K562 cell state and stress response. These observations warrant further investigation using normal and leukemic primary cell models. We further suggest that, ultimately, a well-defined mapping of HDACs to their substrates and corresponding signaling pathways will be important for optimally designing HDACi-based therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: YB-1 is a multifunctional protein, which has been shown to correlate with resistance to treatment of various tumor types. This study investigated the expression and biologic function of YB-1 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression statuses of YB-1 and pYB-1S102 were reversely correlated with the clinical outcomes of DLBCL patients. In addition, we found that YB-1 could promote the proliferation of DLBCL cells by accelerating the G1/S transition. Ectopic expression of YB-1 could markedly increase the expression of cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and cyclin E. Furthermore, we found that adhesion of DLBCL cells to fibronectin (FN) could increase YB-1 phosphorylation at Ser102 and pYB-1S102 nuclear translocation. In addition, overexpression of YB-1 could increase the adhesion of DLBCL cells to FN. Intriguingly, we found that YB-1 overexpression could confer drug resistance through cell-adhesion dependent and independent mechanisms in DLBCL. Silencing of YB-1 could sensitize DLBCL cells to mitoxantrone and overcome cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) phenotype in an AKT-dependent manner.

Abstract: The inner ear is a remarkably intricate structure able to detect sound, motion, and gravity. During development of the zebrafish embryo, the ear undergoes dynamic morphogenesis from a simple epithelial vesicle into a complex labyrinth, consisting of three semicircular canals and three otolithic sensory organs, each with an array of differentiated cell types. This microcosm of biology has led to advances in understanding molecular and cellular changes in epithelial patterning and morphogenesis, through to mechanisms of mechanosensory transduction and the origins of reflexive behavior. In this chapter, we describe different methods to study the zebrafish ear, including high-speed imaging of otic cilia, confocal microscopy, and light-sheet fluorescent microscopy. Many dyes, antibodies, and transgenic lines for labeling the ear are available, and we provide a comprehensive review of these resources. The developing ear is amenable to genetic, chemical, and physical manipulations, including injection and transplantation. Chemical modulation of developmental signaling pathways has paved the way for zebrafish to be widely used in drug discovery. We describe two chemical screens with relevance to the ear: a fluorescent-based screen for compounds that protect against ototoxicity, and an in situ–based screen for modulators of a signaling pathway involved in semicircular canal development. We also describe methods for dissection and imaging of the adult otic epithelia. We review both manual and automated methods to test the function of the inner ear and lateral line, defects in which can lead to altered locomotor behavior. Finally, we review a collection of zebrafish models that are generating new insights into human deafness and vestibular disorders.

Abstract: The correlation between extracellular matrix (ECM) components, cell shape, and stem cell guidance can shed light in understanding and mimicking the functionality of stem cell niches for various applications. This interplay on osteogenic guidance of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) was focus of this study. Proliferation and osteogenic markers like alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium mineralization were slightly increased by the ECM components laminin (LA), collagen I (COL), and fibronectin (FIB); with control medium no differentiation occurred. ECM guided differentiation was rather dependent on osterix than on Runx2 pathway. FIB significantly enhanced cell elongation even in presence of actin polymerization blockers cytochalasin D (CytoD) and ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, which generally caused more rounded cells. Except for the COL surface, both inhibitors increased the extent of osterix, while the Runx2 pathway was more sensitive to the culture condition. Both inhibitors did not affect hASC proliferation. CytoD enabled osteogenic differentiation independently from the ECM, while it was rather blocked via Y-27632 treatment; on FIB the general highest extent of differentiation occurred. Taken together, the ECM effect on hASCs occurs indirectly and selectively via a dominant role of FIB: it sustains osteogenic differentiation in case of a tension-dependent control of actin polymerization.

Abstract: Summary
The KDM5/JARID1 family of Fe(II)- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent demethylases removes methyl groups from methylated lysine 4 of histone H3. Accumulating evidence supports a role for KDM5 family members as oncogenic drivers. We compare the in vitro inhibitory properties and binding affinity of ten diverse compounds with all four family members, and present the crystal structures of the KDM5A-linked Jumonji domain in complex with eight of these inhibitors in the presence of Mn(II). All eight inhibitors structurally examined occupy the binding site of α-ketoglutarate, but differ in their specific binding interactions, including the number of ligands involved in metal coordination. We also observed inhibitor-induced conformational changes in KDM5A, particularly those residues involved in the binding of α-ketoglutarate, the anticipated peptide substrate, and intramolecular interactions. We discuss how particular chemical moieties contribute to inhibitor potency and suggest strategies that might be utilized in the successful design of selective and potent epigenetic inhibitors.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (MSCs) act on different components of the immune response including macrophages (MΦs). Therefore this study has been committed to explore how MSCs may modify the effect of MΦ polarization upon an inductive environment using mouse bone marrow (BM)-derived “naïve”, unpolarized MΦs. Phagocytosis of various MΦ subtypes was different since M1 and M2b showed poorer, while M2a higher rate of phagocytosis. MSCs significantly promoted yeast ingestion by M1 and M2b and diminished it by M2a cells. Under polarizing conditions, MSCs profoundly affected the TNFα production of MΦ subtypes since M1 and M2b MΦs produced less and M2a produced higher amount of TNFα while the amount of IL-10 was not affected. The most striking effect of MSCs was registered on M2b cells since the inflammatory TNFα dominance remarkably shifted to the immunosuppressive IL-10. Prepolarized M1 cells readily converted to M2a and M2b states when polarizing conditions changed from M1 to M2a or M2b induction, respectively. Repolarizing from M1 to M2a resulted in the decline of IL-10 and TNFα and defined elevation of Ym1 similar to levels characteristic to M2a primarily polarized from naïve BM-MΦs. Similarly, polarization of M1 to M2b MΦs was successful showing increase in IL-10 and reduction in TNFα levels characteristic to M2b cells. However, when co-culturing with MSCs, M1-M2a or M1-M2b transition was not affected. Crosstalk between MΦs and MSCs depended on PGE-2 since COX-2 inhibition reduced the effect of MSCs to establish an IL-10-dominant cytokine production by MΦs.

Abstract: Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer with a continuously growing incidence worldwide and is usually resistant to chemotherapy agents, which is due in part to a strong resistance to apoptosis. Previously, we had showed that B16-F0 murine melanoma cells undergoing apoptosis are able to delay their own death induced by ursolic acid (UA), a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid compound. We had demonstrated that tyrosinase and TRP-1 up-regulation in apoptotic cells and the subsequent production of melanin were implicated in an apoptosis resistance mechanism. Several resistance mechanisms to apoptosis have been characterized in melanoma such as hyperactivation of DNA repair mechanisms, drug efflux systems, and reinforcement of survival signals (PI3K/Akt, NF-κB and Raf/MAPK pathways). Otherwise, other mechanisms of apoptosis resistance involving different proteins, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), have been described in many cancer types. By using a strategy of specific inhibition of each ways, we suggested that there was an interaction between melanogenesis and COX-2/PGE2 pathway. This was characterized by analyzing the COX-2 expression and activity, the expression of tyrosinase and melanin production. Furthermore, we showed that anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects of UA were mediated through modulation of multiple signaling pathways including Akt and ERK-1/2 proteins. Our study not only uncovers underlying molecular mechanisms of UA action in human melanoma cancer cells but also suggest its great potential as an adjuvant in treatment and cancer prevention.

Abstract: Homeodomain gene Distal-less-3 (DLX3) plays an essential role in the development of bones. Mutations of DLX3 are closely associated with Tricho-Dento-Osseous (TDO) syndrome featured with increased bone formation. However, the mechanism regarding whether DLX3 regulates osteoclastogenesis remains largely unknown. In this study, we firstly examined the expression of DLX3 mounting during osteoclastic differentiation process, and then established stably expressing wild type DLX3 (WT-DLX3), a novel mutant DLX3 (Q178R) found in our laboratory recently (MT-DLX3) and Dlx3 knockdown cell lines (Dlx3-shRNA) in Raw 264.7 cells using corresponding lentiviruses. Next, we investigated the influence of DLX3 on these stable cells in the process of osteoclastogenesis. The results showed that the expression of osteoclastogenesis-related genes as well as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells were lower in WT-DLX3 and MT-DLX3, but higher in Dlx3-shRNA compared with control cells. Besides, the microRNA-124 expression was higher in WT-DLX3 and MT-DLX3 but lower in Dlx3-shRNA. Moreover, the microRNA-124 expression level positively correlated with DLX3, negatively with osteoclastogenesis-related gene NFATc1. Our results indicate that DLX3 negatively regulates osteoclastic differentiation through microRNA-124, which is partially responsible for the increased bone density in TDO patient. DLX3 may be exploited for osteoclastogenesis regulator and potential therapeutic target of osteoporosis in future.

Abstract: Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can efficiently differentiate into the three germ layers similar to those formed by differentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells. This provides a new source of cells in which to establish preclinical allogeneic transplantation models. Our iPS cells were generated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transfected with the Yamanaka factors, the four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc), without antibiotic selection or MEF feeders. After the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), iPS cells spontaneously differentiated into Flk1-positive cardiac progenitors and cardiomyocytes expressing cardiac-specific markers such as alpha sarcomeric actinin (α-actinin), cardiac alpha myosin heavy chain (α-MHC), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and connexin 43 (CX43), as well as cardiac transcription factors Nk2 homebox 5 (Nkx2.5) and gata binding protein 4 (gata4). The electrophysiological activity of iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) was detected in beating cell clusters with optical mapping and RH237 a voltage-sensitive dye, and in single contracting cells with patch-clamp technology. Incompletely differentiated iPS cells formed teratomas when transplanted into a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model of myocardial infarction. Our results show that somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells, which in turn spontaneously differentiate into electrophysiologically functional mature cardiomyocytes expressing cardiac-specific makers, and that these cells can potentially be used to repair myocardial infarction (MI) in the future.

Abstract: Summary
A population of CD4 T lymphocytes harboring latent HIV genomes can persist in patients on antiretroviral therapy, posing a barrier to HIV eradication. To examine cellular complexes controlling HIV latency, we conducted a genome-wide screen with a pooled ultracomplex shRNA library and in vitro system modeling HIV latency and identified the mTOR complex as a modulator of HIV latency. Knockdown of mTOR complex subunits or pharmacological inhibition of mTOR activity suppresses reversal of latency in various HIV-1 latency models and HIV-infected patient cells. mTOR inhibitors suppress HIV transcription both through the viral transactivator Tat and via Tat-independent mechanisms. This inhibition occurs at least in part via blocking the phosphorylation of CDK9, a p-TEFb complex member that serves as a cofactor for Tat-mediated transcription. The control of HIV latency by mTOR signaling identifies a pathway that may have significant therapeutic opportunities.

Abstract: The vertebrate retina is remarkably conserved in evolution. Its relative simplicity and well-defined architecture make it particularly suitable for developmental and functional analysis of neuronal networks in the vertebrate central nervous system. The zebrafish model is at the forefront of these studies. It makes it possible to apply a wide variety of parallel embryological, genetic, and imaging tools to study the eye. Here we discuss experimental approaches that range from cell lineage analysis to the imaging of synaptic calcium currents and atomic force microscopy. These methods are currently used in zebrafish to model morphogenetic events during early development of the eye primordium, cell fate decisions during retinal neurogenesis, and the differentiation and function of the many fine structural features that underlie the detection and processing of light stimuli in the eye.

Abstract: Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) can severely disrupt lung function, leading to fatal consequences. Salidroside is a principal active ingredient of Rhodiola rosea and has recently been reported to protect against lung injures. The present study was aimed at exploring its therapeutic effects on PF. Lung fibrotic injuries were induced in SD rats by a single intratracheal instillation of 5 mg/kg bleomycin (BLM). Then, these rats were administrated with 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg salidroside for 28 days. BLM-triggered structure distortion, collagen overproduction, excessive inflammatory infiltration, and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and oxidative stress damages in lung tissues were attenuated by salidroside in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, salidroside was noted to inhibit IκBα phosphorylation and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 nuclear accumulation while activating Nrf2-antioxidant signaling in BLM-treated lungs. Downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin, fibronectin, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) indicated an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like shift in BLM-treated lungs. These changes were suppressed by salidroside. The expression of TGF-β1 and the phosphorylation of its downstream targets, Smad-2/-3, were enhanced by BLM, but weakened by salidroside. Additionally, salidroside was capable of reversing the recombinant TGF-β1-induced EMT-like changes in alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. Our study reveals that salidroside’s protective effects against fibrotic lung injuries are correlated to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antifibrotic properties.

Abstract: To understand the potential association of heat stress resistance with HspB1 induction by aspirin (ASA) in chicken myocardial cells, variations of HspB1 expression and heat stressed-induced damage of myocardial cells after ASA administration were studied in primary cultured myocardial cells. Cytopathological lesions as well as damage-related enzymes, such as creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicated the considerable protective ability of ASA pre-treatment against acute heat stress. Immunostaining assays showed that heat stress caused HspB1 to relocate into the nucleus, while ASA did not. ELISA analysis, revealed that HspB1 expression induced by ASA averaged 45.62-fold higher than that of the control. These results indicated that the acute heat-stressed injuries were accompanied by comparatively lower HspB1 expression caused by heat stress in vitro. ASA pre-treatment induced a level of HspB1 presumed to be sufficient to protect myocardial cells from acute heat stress in the extracorporal model, although more detailed mechanisms will require further investigation.

Abstract: Rice (Oryza sativa) ClpB-C (OsClpB-C) protein is expressed upon heat stress in vegetative tissues and constitutively in seeds. We produced stably transformed Arabidopsis plants carrying β-glucuronidase (Gus) reporter gene downstream to 1-kb OsClpB-C promoter (1kbPro plants). In the 1kbPro plants, expression of Gus transcript and protein followed the expression pattern of OsClpB-C gene in rice plants, i.e., heat induced in vegetative tissues and constitutive in seeds. Next, we produced transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing Gus downstream to 862-bp fragment of OsClpB-C promoter [lacking 138 nucleotides from 3′ end of the 5′untranslated region (5′UTR); ∆UTR plants). In ∆UTR plants, Gus transcript was expressed in heat-inducible manner, but strikingly, Gus protein levels were negligible after heat treatment. However, Gus protein was expressed in ∆UTR seedlings at levels comparable to 1kbPro seedlings when recovery treatment of 22 °C/2 h was given post heat stress (38 °C/15 min). This suggests that 5′UTR of OsClpB-C gene is involved in its post-transcriptional regulation and is an obligate requirement for protein expression during persistent heat stress. Furthermore, the Gus transcript levels were higher in the polysomal RNA fraction in heat-stressed seedlings of 1kbPro plants as compared to ∆UTR plants, indicating that 5′UTR aids in assembly of ribosomes onto the Gus transcript during heat stress. Unlike the case of seedlings, Gus protein was formed constitutively in ∆UTR seeds at levels comparable to 1kbPro seeds. Hence, the function of 5′UTR of OsClpB-C is dispensable for expression in seeds.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue virus infects more than 300 million people annually, yet there is no widely protective vaccine or drugs against the virus. Efforts to develop antivirals against classical targets such as the viral protease and polymerase have not yielded drugs that have advanced to the clinic. Here, we show that the allosteric Abl kinase inhibitor GNF-2 interferes with dengue virus replication via activity mediated by cellular Abl kinases but additionally blocks viral entry via an Abl-independent mechanism. To characterize this newly discovered antiviral activity, we developed disubstituted pyrimidines that block dengue virus entry with structure-activity relationships distinct from those driving kinase inhibition. We demonstrate that biotin- and fluorophore-conjugated derivatives of GNF-2 interact with the dengue glycoprotein, E, in the pre-fusion conformation that exists on the virion surface, and that this interaction inhibits viral entry. This study establishes GNF-2 as an antiviral compound with polypharmacological activity and provides “lead” compounds for further optimization efforts.

Abstract: Summary
S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is an endogenous transnitrosation donor involved in S-nitrosation of a variety of cellular proteins, thereby regulating diverse protein functions. Quantitative proteomic methods are necessary to establish which cysteine residues are most sensitive to GSNO-mediated transnitrosation. Here, a competitive cysteine-reactivity profiling strategy was implemented to quantitatively measure the sensitivity of >600 cysteine residues to transnitrosation by GSNO. This platform identified a subset of cysteine residues with a high propensity for GSNO-mediated transnitrosation. Functional characterization of previously unannotated S-nitrosation sites revealed that S-nitrosation of a cysteine residue distal to the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type 2 (HADH2) active site impaired catalytic activity. Similarly, S-nitrosation of a non-catalytic cysteine residue in the lysosomal aspartyl protease cathepsin D (CTSD) inhibited proteolytic activation. Together, these studies revealed two previously uncharacterized cysteine residues that regulate protein function, and established a chemical-proteomic platform with capabilities to determine substrate specificity of other cellular transnitrosation agents.

Abstract: Summary
Cells use plasma membrane proton fluxes to maintain cytoplasmic and extracellular pH and to mediate the co-transport of metabolites and ions. Because proton-coupled transport often involves movement of multiple substrates, traditional electrical measurements provide limited information about proton transport at the cell surface. Here we visualize voltage-dependent proton fluxes over the entire landscape of a cell by covalently attaching small-molecule fluorescent pH sensors to the cell's glycocalyx. We found that the extracellularly facing sensors enable real-time detection of proton accumulation and depletion at the plasma membrane, providing an indirect readout of channel and transporter activity that correlated with whole-cell proton current. Moreover, the proton wavefront emanating from one cell was readily visible as it crossed over nearby cells. Given that any small-molecule fluorescent sensor can be covalently attached to a cell's glycocalyx, our approach is readily adaptable to visualize most electrogenic and non-electrogenic transport events at the plasma membrane.

Abstract: Developing cell sensitive indicators on interacting substrates that allows specific cell manipulation by a combination of physical, chemical or mechanical cues is a challenge for current biomaterials. Hence, various fabrication approaches have been created on a variety of substrates to mimic or create cell specific cues. However, to achieve cell specific cues a multistep process or a post-chemical treatment is often necessitated. So, a simple approach without any chemical or biological treatment would go a long way in developing bio-functionalized substrates to effectively modulate cell adhesion and interaction. The present investigation is aimed to study the manipulative activity induced by phase transformed titanium surface. An ultra-short laser is used to fabricate the phase transformed titanium surface where a polymorphic titanium oxide phases with titanium monoxide (TiO), tri-titanium oxide (Ti3O) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) have been synthesized on commercially pure titanium. Control over oxide phase transformed area was demonstrated via a combination of laser scanning time (laser pulse interaction time) and laser pulse widths (laser pulse to pulse separation time). The interaction of phase transformed titanium surface with NIH3T3 fibroblasts and MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells developed a new bio-functionalized platforms on titanium based biomaterials to modulate cell migration and adhesion. The synthesized phase transformed titanium surface on the whole appeared to induce directional cues for cell migration with unique preferential cell adhesion unseen by other fabrication approaches. The precise bio-functionalization controllability exhibited during fabrication offers perceptible edge for developing a variety of smart bio-medical devices, implants and cardiovascular stents where the need in supressing specific cell adhesion and proliferation is of great demand.

Abstract: Previous studies showed nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF) can ablate solid tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but its effect on cell membrane is not fully understood. We hypothesized nsPEF disrupt the microdomains on outer-cellular membrane with direct mechanical force and as a result the plasma membrane permeability increases to facilitate the small molecule intake. Three HCC cells were pulsed one pulse per minute, an interval longer than nanopore resealing time. The cationized ferritin was used to mark up the electronegative microdomains, propidium iodide (PI) for membrane permeabilization, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for the negative cell surface charge and cisplatin for inner-cellular cytotoxicity. We demonstrated that the ferritin marked-microdomain and negative cell surface charge were disrupted by nsPEF caused-mechanical force. The cell uptake of propidium and cytotoxicity of DNA-targeted cisplatin increased with a dose effect. Cisplatin gains its maximum inner-cellular cytotoxicity when combining with nsPEF stimulation. We conclude that nsPEF disrupt the microdomains on the outer cellular membrane directly and increase the membrane permeabilization for PI and cisplatin. The microdomain disruption and membrane infiltration changes are caused by the mechanical force from the changes of negative cell surface charge.

Abstract: Summary
When comparing hepatic phenotypes between iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells from different liver disease patients, cell heterogeneity can confound interpretation. We proposed that homogeneous cell populations could be generated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Using cell-surface capture proteomics, we identified a total of 300 glycoproteins on hepatocytes. Analyses of the expression profiles during the differentiation of iPSCs revealed that SLC10A1, CLRN3, and AADAC were highly enriched during the final stages of hepatocyte differentiation. FACS purification of hepatocyte-like cells expressing SLC10A1, CLRN3, or AADAC demonstrated enrichment of cells with hepatocyte characteristics. Moreover, transcriptome analyses revealed that cells expressing the liver gene regulatory network were enriched while cells expressing a pluripotent stem cell network were depleted. In conclusion, we report an extensive catalog of cell-surface N-linked glycoproteins expressed in primary hepatocytes and identify cell-surface proteins that facilitate the purification of homogeneous populations of iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells.

Abstract: Summary
The development of dengue antivirals and vaccine has been hampered by the incomplete understanding of molecular mechanisms of dengue virus (DENV) infection and pathology, partly due to the limited suitable cell culture or animal models that can capture the comprehensive cellular changes induced by DENV. In this study, we differentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into hepatocytes, one of the target cells of DENV, to investigate various aspects of DENV-hepatocyte interaction. hPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) supported persistent and productive DENV infection. The activation of interferon pathways by DENV protected bystander cells from infection and protected the infected cells from massive apoptosis. Furthermore, DENV infection activated the NF-κB pathway, which led to production of proinflammatory cytokines and downregulated many liver-specific genes such as albumin and coagulation factor V. Our study demonstrates the utility of hPSC-derived hepatocytes as an in vitro model for DENV infection and reveals important aspects of DENV-host interactions.

Abstract: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is altered in mdx mouse, an animal model to study Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Our previous work demonstrated that perivascular glial endfeet control the selective exchanges between blood and neuropil as well as the BBB development and integrity; the alterations of dystrophin and dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPs) in the glial cells of mdx mouse, parallel damages of the BBB and increase in vascular permeability. The aim of this study was to improve our knowledge about brain cellular components in the mdx mouse through the isolation, for the first time, of the adult neural stem cells (ANSCs). We characterized them by FACS, electron microscopy, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, Real Time-PCR and western blotting, and we studied the expression of the DAPs aquaporin-4 (AQP4), potassium channel Kir4.1, α- and β-dystroglycan (αDG, βDG), α-syntrophin (αSyn), and short dystrophin isoform Dp71 proteins. The results showed that the mdx ANSCs expressed CD133 and Nestin receptor as the control ones, but showed a reduction in Notch receptor and altered cell proliferation with an increment in the apoptotic nuclei. Ultrastructurally, they appeared 50% size reduced compared to control ones, with a few cytoplasmic organelles. Moreover, the mdx ANSCs are devoid in full length dystrophin 427, and they expressed post-transcriptional reduction in the Dp71 in parallel with the ubiquitin proteasome activation, and decrement of DAPs proteins which appeared diffused in the cytoplasm and not polarized on the stem cells plasmamembrane, as prevalently observed in the controls. Overall, these results indicate that structural and molecular alterations affect the neural stem cells in the dystrophic brain, whose increased apoptosis and reduced Dp71 and DAPs proteins expression, together with loss in Dp427 dystrophin, could be responsible of the altered mdx glial maintenance and differentiation and consequent failure in the vessels barrier control occurring in the adult dystrophic brain.

Abstract: Recently, advantages concerning targeting specificity of PCR constructed oligonucleotide FISH probes in contrast to established FISH probes, e.g. BAC clones, have been demonstrated. These techniques, however, are still using labelling protocols with DNA denaturing steps applying harsh heat treatment with or without further denaturing chemical agents. COMBO-FISH (COMBinatorial Oligonucleotide FISH) allows the design of specific oligonucleotide probe combinations in silico. Thus, being independent from primer libraries or PCR laboratory conditions, the probe sequences extracted by computer sequence data base search can also be synthesized as single stranded PNA-probes (Peptide Nucleic Acid probes). Gene targets can be specifically labelled with at least about 20 PNA-probes obtaining visibly background free specimens. By using appropriately designed triplex forming oligonucleotides, the denaturing procedures can completely be omitted. These results reveal a significant step towards oligonucleotide-FISH maintaining the 3d-nanostructure and even the viability of the cell target. The method is demonstrated with the detection of Her2/neu and GRB7 genes, which are indicators in breast cancer diagnosis and therapy.

Abstract: Platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) and their receptors (PDGFRs) contribute to normal heart development. Deficient or abnormal expression of Pdgf and Pdgfr genes have a negative impact on cardiac development and function. The cellular effects of PDGFs in the hearts of Pdgf/Pdgfr mutants and the pathogenesis of the resulting abnormalities are poorly understood, but different PDGF isoforms induce varying effects. Here, we generated three new transgenic mouse types which complete a set of studies, where all different PDGF ligands have been expressed under the same heart specific alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. Transgenic expression of the natural isoforms of Pdgfa and Pdgfb resulted in isoform specific fibrotic reactions and cardiac hypertrophy. Pdgfa overexpression resulted in a severe fibrotic reaction with up to 8-fold increase in cardiac size, leading to lethal cardiac failure within a few weeks after birth. In contrast, Pdgfb overexpression led to focal fibrosis and moderate cardiac hypertrophy. As PDGF-A and PDGF-B have different affinity for the two PDGF receptors, we analyzed the expression of the receptors and the histology of the fibrotic hearts. Our data suggest that the stronger fibrotic effect generated by Pdgfa overexpression was mediated by Pdgfrα in cardiac interstitial mesenchymal cells, i.e. the likely source of extracellular matrix depostion and fibrotic reaction. The apparent sensitivity of the heart to ectopic PDGFRα agonists supports a role for endogenous PDGFRα agonists in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis.

Abstract: In vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos show both cell cycle and developmental arrest. We previously showed oxidative damage activates the ATM → Chk1 → Cdc25B/Cdc25C cascade to mediate G2/M cell cycle arrest for repair of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative damage in sperm. However, the mechanisms underlying the developmental delay of zygotes are unknown. To develop a model of oxidative-damaged zygotes, we treated mouse zygotes with different concentrations of H2O2 (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05 mM), and evaluated in vitro zygote development, BrdU incorporation to detect the duration of S phase. We also examined reactive oxygen species level and used immunofluorescence to detect activation of γH2AX, Cdc2, and Cdc25. Oxidatively damaged zygotes showed a delay in G2/M phase and produced a higher level of ROS. At the same time, γH2AX was detected in oxidatively damaged zygotes as well as phospho-Cdc25B (Ser323), phospho-Cdc25C (Ser216), and phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr15). Our study indicates that oxidative stress-induced DNA damage of mouse zygotes triggers the cell cycle checkpoint, which results in G2/M cell cycle arrest, and that phospho-Cdc25B (Ser323), phospho-Cdc25C (Ser216), and phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr15) participate in activating the G2/M checkpoint.

Abstract: Aldosterone has been recognized as a risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Studies have indicated that enhanced activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is associated with the development and progression of renal fibrosis. But if EGFR is involved in aldosterone-induced renal fibrosis is less investigated. In the present study, we examined the effect of erlotinib, an inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, on the progression of aldosterone-induced renal profibrotic responses in a murine model underwent uninephrectomy. Erlotinib-treated rats exhibited relieved structural lesion comparing with rats treated with aldosterone alone, as characterized by glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial cell proliferation and expansion. Also, erlotinib inhibited the expression of TGF-β, α-SMA and mesangial matrix proteins such as collagen Ⅳ and fibronectin. In cultured mesangial cells, inhibition of EGFR also abrogated aldosterone-induced expression of extracellular matrix proteins, cell proliferation and migration. We also demonstrated that aldosterone induced the phosphorylation of EGFR through generation of ROS. And the activation of EGFR resulted in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, leading to the activation of profibrotic pathways. Taken together, we concluded that aldosterone-mediated tissue fibrosis relies on ROS induced EGFR/ERK activation, highlighting EGFR as a potential therapeutic target for modulating renal fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
A major goal in understanding autoimmune diseases is to define the antigens that elicit a self-destructive immune response, but this is a difficult endeavor. In an effort to discover autoantigens associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), we used epitope surrogate technology that screens combinatorial libraries of synthetic molecules for compounds that could recognize disease-linked autoantibodies and enrich them from serum. Autoantibodies from one patient revealed a highly phosphorylated form of peripherin, a neuroendocrine filament protein, as a candidate T1D antigen. Peripherin antibodies were detected in 72% of donor patient sera. Further analysis revealed that the T1D-associated antibodies only recognized a dimeric conformation of peripherin. These data explain why peripherin was dismissed as an important T1D antigen previously. The discovery of this novel autoantigen would not have been possible using standard methods, such as hybridizing serum antibodies to recombinant protein arrays, highlighting the power of epitope surrogate technology for probing the mechanism of autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Indirect evidence suggests that adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASCs) possess different physiological and biological variations related to the anatomical localization of the adipose depots. Accordingly, to investigate the influence of the tissue origin on the intrinsic properties of ASCs and to assess their response to specific stimuli, we compared the biological, functional and ultrastructural properties of two ASC pools derived from mediastinal and subcutaneous depots (thoracic compartment) by means of supplements such as platelet lysate (PL) and FBS. Subcutaneous ASCs exhibited higher proliferative and clonogenic abilities than mediastinal counterpart, as well as increased secreted levels of IL-6 combined with lower amount of VEGF-C. In contrast, mediastinal ASCs displayed enhanced pro-angiogenic and adipogenic differentiation properties, increased cell diameter and early autophagic processes, highlighted by electron microscopy. Our results further support the hypothesis that the origin of adipose tissue significantly defines the biological properties of ASCs, and that a homogeneric function for all ASCs cannot be assumed.

Abstract: Wnt signaling plays a central role in tumor initiation and tumor progression. Mutations in Wnt pathway components, such as the tumor suppressor APC, lead to malignant transformation. While previous studies focused on Wnt-related changes in cancer cells, the impact of aberrant Wnt signaling on the tumor microenvironment is only beginning to emerge. In order to investigate the role of increased Wnt secretion on tumor growth and the microenvironment, we generated a novel germ cell tumor model by overexpressing the Wnt secretion factor Evi/Wls in mouse embryonic stem cells. Evi-overexpressing teratoma were characterized by enhanced tumor growth in supporting a tumor-promoting role of Wnt secretion. Interestingly, enhanced Evi expression correlated with impaired immune cell recruitment. Specifically, T- and B-cell infiltration was reduced in Evi-overexpressing teratomas, which was independent of teratoma size and differentiation. Our study suggests that Wnt secretion impairs immunosurveillance. Since immune cell infiltration has been shown to have prognostic value, the levels of secreted Wnt activity might impact the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Accurate transcriptional control of genes is fundamental for the correct functioning of organs and developmental processes. This control depends on the interplay between the promoter of genes and other noncoding sequences, whose interaction is mediated by 3D chromatin arrangements. Thus, the detailed description of transcriptional regulatory landscapes is essential to understand the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. However, to achieve that, two important challenges have to be faced: (1) the identification of the noncoding sequences that contribute to gene transcription and (2) the association of these sequences to the respective genes they control. In this chapter, we describe two protocols that allow overcoming these important challenges: the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) and circularized chromosome conformation capture (4C-seq). ATAC-seq is a very efficient technique that, using a very low number of cells as starting material, allows the identification of active chromatin regions genome wide, whereas 4C-seq detects the subset of sequences that interact specifically with the promoter of a given gene. When combined, both techniques provide a comprehensive snapshot of the regulatory landscapes of developmental genes. The protocols we present here have been optimized for teleost fish samples, zebrafish and medaka, allowing the in-depth study of transcriptional regulation in these two emerging animal models. Given the amenability and easy genetic manipulation of these two experimental systems, we anticipate that they will be important in revealing general principles of the vertebrate regulatory genome.

Abstract: The giant axon of the squid provides a unique cell biological model for analyzing the biochemistry and cell biology of the axon. These axons may exceed 500μm in diameter and can be readily dissected. Once the surrounding small axons and connective tissue are removed, the axoplasm can be extruded as an intact cylinder of isolated cytoplasm. This isolated axoplasm is morphologically indistinguishable from the intact axon, but without permeability barriers. Fast axonal transport will continue for more than 4h after extrusion and can be visualized in real time. By perfusing defined concentrations of proteins and/or reagents into the axoplasm, this preparation represents a powerful model for study of intracellular trafficking and its underlying molecular mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic and unexpected clinical outcomes, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and birth defects, has brought an urgent need for animal models. We evaluated infection and pathogenesis with contemporary and historical ZIKV strains in immunocompetent mice and mice lacking components of the antiviral response. Four- to six-week-old Irf3−/− Irf5−/− Irf7−/− triple knockout mice, which produce little interferon α/β, and mice lacking the interferon receptor (Ifnar1−/−) developed neurological disease and succumbed to ZIKV infection, whereas single Irf3−/−, Irf5−/−, and Mavs−/− knockout mice exhibited no overt illness. Ifnar1−/− mice sustained high viral loads in the brain and spinal cord, consistent with evidence that ZIKV causes neurodevelopmental defects in human fetuses. The testes of Ifnar1−/− mice had the highest viral loads, which is relevant to sexual transmission of ZIKV. This model of ZIKV pathogenesis will be valuable for evaluating vaccines and therapeutics as well as understanding disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: Among breast cancer subtypes, basal-like breast cancer is particularly aggressive, and research on the molecules involved in its pathology might contribute to therapy. In this study, we found that expression of NKX6.1, a homeobox transcription factor, is higher in basal-like breast cancer than in other subtypes. In loss-of-function experiments on basal-like breast cancer cell lines, NKX6.1-depleted cells exhibited reduced cell growth. Because cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is expressed in basal-like breast cancer, and increases cell growth, we analyzed expression levels of IL6, an IL-6 gene, and observed reduced IL6 expression in NKX6.1-depleted cells. In a reporter assay, IL6 promoter activity was reduced by loss of NKX6.1 function. A pull-down assay showed that NKX6.1 binds to the proximal region in IL6 promoter. These results indicate that NKX6.1 directly up-regulates IL6 expression. To investigate further, we established cells with forced expression of IL-6. We observed that exogenous IL-6 expression restored the reduced cell growth of NKX6.1-depleted cells. Furthermore, orthotopic xenografts showed that NKX6.1-depleted cells lost the capacity for tumor formation. We therefore conclude that NKX6.1 is a factor for IL-6-regulated growth and tumor formation in basal-like breast cancer. Our findings facilitate profound understanding of basal-like breast cancer, and the development of suitable therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Essential characteristics of cellular signaling networks include a complex interconnected architecture and temporal dynamics of protein activity. The latter can be monitored by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors at a single-live-cell level with high temporal resolution. However, these experiments are typically limited to the use of a couple of FRET biosensors. Here, we describe a FRET-based multi-parameter imaging platform (FMIP) that allows simultaneous high-throughput monitoring of multiple signaling pathways. We apply FMIP to monitor the crosstalk between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor signaling, signaling perturbations caused by pathophysiologically relevant EGFR mutations, and the effects of a clinically important MEK inhibitor (selumetinib) on the EGFR network. We expect that in the future the platform will be applied to develop comprehensive models of signaling networks and will help to investigate the mechanism of action as well as side effects of therapeutic treatments.

Abstract: Statins are competitive inhibitors of hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a key enzyme involved in the conversion of HMG-CoA to the cholesterol precursor mevalonate. Some statins, such as simvastatin (simvastatin), have been shown to have anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects, reducing cartilage degradation in osteoarthritic rabbits in vivo. However, the regulatory mechanisms undergirding simvastatin mediated chondrocyte differentiation have not been well elucidated. Thus, we investigated the action and mechanism of simvastatin on differentiation of rabbit articular chondrocytes through western blot analyses, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Simvastatin treatment was found to induce type II collagen expression and sulfated-proteoglycan synthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Indeed, RT-PCR revealed increased expression of type II collagen on treatment with simvastatin. Both IHC and IF staining indicated differentiation of chondrocytes. Simvastatin treatment reduced activation of ERK-1/2 and stimulated activation of p38 kinase. Inhibition of ERK-1/2 with PD98059 enhanced simvastatin induced differentiation, whereas inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 inhibited simvastatin induced differentiation. Simvastatin treatment also inhibits loss of type II collagen in serial monolayer culture. Collectively, our results indicate that ERK-1/2 and p38 kinase regulate simvastatin-induced differentiation of chondrocytes in opposing manners. Thus, these findings suggest that simvastatin may be a potential therapeutic drug for osteoarthritis.

Abstract: The pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease stems from mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to a chronic respiratory disease. Actin cytoskeleton is disorganized in CF airway epithelial cells, likely contributing to the CF-associated basic defects, i.e. defective chloride secretion and sodium/fluid hypersorption. In this work, we aimed to find whether this alteration could be pointed out by means of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) investigation, as roughness and Young's elastic module. Moreover, we also sought to determine whether disorganization of actin cytoskeleton is linked to hypersoption of apical fluid. Not only CFBE41o- (CFBE) cells, immortalized airway epithelial cells homozygous for the F508del CFTR allele, showed a different morphology in comparison with 16HBE14o- (16HBE) epithelial cells, wild-type for CFTR, but also they displayed a lack of stress fibers, suggestive of a disorganized actin cytoskeleton. AFM measurements showed that CFBE cells presented a higher membrane roughness and decreased rigidity as compared with 16HBE cells. CFBE overexpressing wtCFTR became more elongated than the parental CFBE cell line and presented actin stress fibers. CFBE cells absorbed more fluid from the apical compartment. Study of fluid absorption with the F-actin-depolymerizing agent Latrunculin B demonstrated that actin cytoskeletal disorganization increased fluid absorption, an effect observed at higher magnitude in 16HBE than in CFBE cells. For the first time, we demonstrate that actin cytoskeleton disorganization is reflected by AFM parameters in CF airway epithelial cells. Our data also strongly suggest that the lack of stress fibers is involved in at least one of the early step in CF pathophysiology at the levels of the airways, i.e. fluid hypersorption.

Abstract: Summary
De novo ASXL1 mutations are found in patients with Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a disease with severe developmental defects and early childhood mortality. The underlying pathologic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using Asxl1-targeted murine models, we found that Asxl1 global loss as well as conditional deletion in osteoblasts and their progenitors led to significant bone loss and a markedly decreased number of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) compared with wild-type littermates. Asxl1−/− BMSCs displayed impaired self-renewal and skewed differentiation, away from osteoblasts and favoring adipocytes. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed altered expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, skeletal development, and morphogenesis. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis showed decreased expression of stem cell self-renewal gene signature, suggesting a role of Asxl1 in regulating the stemness of BMSCs. Importantly, re-introduction of Asxl1 normalized NANOG and OCT4 expression and restored the self-renewal capacity of Asxl1−/− BMSCs. Our study unveils a pivotal role of ASXL1 in the maintenance of BMSC functions and skeletal development.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exhibit unique cell cycle structure, self-renewal and pluripotency. The Forkhead box transcription factor M1 (FOXM1) is critically required for the maintenance of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse embryonal carcinoma cells, but its role in hESCs remains unclear. Here, we show that FOXM1 expression was enriched in undifferentiated hESCs and was regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner with peak levels detected at the G2/M phase. Expression of FOXM1 did not correlate with OCT4 and NANOG during in vitro differentiation of hESCs. Importantly, knockdown of FOXM1 expression led to aberrant cell cycle distribution with impairment in mitotic progression but showed no profound effect on the undifferentiated state. Interestingly, FOXM1 depletion sensitized hESCs to oxidative stress. Moreover, genome-wide analysis of FOXM1 targets by ChIP-seq identified genes important for M phase including CCNB1 and CDK1, which were subsequently confirmed by ChIP and RNA interference analyses. Further peak set comparison against a differentiating hESC line and a cancer cell line revealed a substantial difference in the genomic binding profile of FOXM1 in hESCs. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence to support FOXM1 as an important regulator of cell cycle progression and defense against oxidative stress in hESCs.

Abstract: Cisplatin (CDDP) is currently recommended as the front-line chemotherapeutic agent for lung cancer. However, the resistance to cisplatin is widespread in patients with advanced lung cancer, and the molecular mechanism of such resistance remains incompletely understood. Disheveled (DVL), a key mediator of Wnt/β-catenin, has been linked to cancer progression, while the role of DVL in cancer drug resistance is not clear. Here, we found that DVL2 was over-expressed in cisplatin-resistant human lung cancer cells A549/CDDP compared to the parental A549 cells. Inhibition of DVL2 by its inhibitor (3289-8625) or shDVL2 resensitized A549/CDDP cells to cisplatin. In addition, over-expression of DVL2 in A549 cells increased the protein levels of BCRP, MRP4, and Survivin, which are known to be associated with chemoresistance, while inhibition of DVL2 in A549/CDDP cells decreased these protein levels, and reduced the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. In addition, shβ-catenin abolished the DVL2-induced the expression of BCRP, MRP4, and Survivin. Furthermore, our data showed that GSK3β/β-catenin signals were aberrantly activated by DVL2, and inactivation of GSK3β reversed the shDVL2-induced down-regulation of β-catenin. Taken together, these results suggested that inhibition of DVL2 can sensitize cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells through down-regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and inhibiting BCRP, MRP4, and Survivin expression. It promises a new strategy to chemosensitize cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in lung cancer.

Abstract: Human umbilical cord (hUC) blood and tissue are non-invasive sources of potential stem/progenitor cells with similar cell surface properties as bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). While they are limited in cord blood, they may be more abundant in hUC. However, the hUC is an anatomically complex organ and the potential of cells in various sites of the hUC has not been fully explored. We dissected the hUC into its discrete sites and isolated hUC cells from the cord placenta junction (CPJ), cord tissue (CT), and Wharton's jelly (WJ). Isolated cells displayed fibroblastoid morphology, and expressed CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105, and showed evidence of differentiation into multiple lineages in vitro. They also expressed low levels of pluripotency genes, OCT4, NANOG, SOX2 and KLF4. Passaging markedly affected cell proliferation with concomitant decreases in the expression of pluripotency and other markers, and an increase in chondrogenic markers. Microarray analysis further revealed the differences in the gene expression of CPJ-, CT- and WJ-hUC cells. Five coding and five lncRNA genes were differentially expressed in low vs. high passage hUC cells. Only MAEL was expressed at high levels in both low and high passage CPJ-hUC cells. They displayed a greater proliferation limit and a higher degree of multi-lineage differentiation in vitro and warrant further investigation to determine their full differentiation capacity, and therapeutic and regenerative medicine potential.
