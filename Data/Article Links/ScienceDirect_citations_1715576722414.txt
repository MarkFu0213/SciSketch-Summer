Abstract: Metabolic reprogramming is considered as a hallmark of cancer and is clinically exploited as a novel target for therapy. The E2F transcription factor-1 (E2F1) regulates various cellular processes, including proliferative and metabolic pathways, and acts, depending on the cellular and molecular context, as an oncogene or tumor suppressor. The latter is evident by the observation that E2f1-knockout mice develop spontaneous tumors, including uterine sarcomas. This dual role warrants a detailed investigation of how E2F1 loss impacts metabolic pathways related to cancer progression. Our data indicate that E2F1 binds to the promoter of several glutamine metabolism-related genes. Interestingly, the expression of genes in the glutamine metabolic pathway were increased in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking E2F1. In addition, we confirm that E2f1−/− MEFs are more efficient in metabolizing glutamine and producing glutamine-derived precursors for proliferation. Mechanistically, we observe a co-occupancy of E2F1 and MYC on glutamine metabolic promoters, increased MYC binding after E2F1 depletion and that silencing of MYC decreased the expression of glutamine-related genes in E2f1−/− MEFs. Analyses of transcriptomic profiles in 29 different human cancers identified uterine sarcoma that showed a negative correlation between E2F1 and glutamine metabolic genes. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of E2F1 in the uterine sarcoma cell line SK-UT-1 confirmed elevated glutamine metabolic gene expression, increased proliferation and increased MYC binding to glutamine-related promoters upon E2F1 loss. Together, our data suggest a crucial role of E2F1 in energy metabolism and metabolic adaptation in uterine sarcoma cells.

Abstract: Our previous studies showed that S100A9 was overexpressed in glioma and promoted tumor growth. However, S100A9 can also be secreted by tumor cells to regulate the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we aimed to explore the functions of glioma derived-S100A9 in microglial M2 polarization, resulting in inhibition of CD8+ T lymphocytes and promotion of immunosuppression. We first showed that glioma exhibited higher expression and secretion of S100A9 than astrocytes. After knocking down S100A9 in two glioma cell lines, the secretion of S100A9 was repressed. Then, the medium was collected and considered as conditioned medium (CM), which was incubated with microglia. We found that glioma-derived S100A9 drove microglial M2 polarization and increased TGFβ1 secretion. These molecular mechanisms were related to the interaction of S100A9 with αvβ3 integrin and the subsequent activation of AKT1 in microglia. Furthermore, we demonstrated that S100A9-induced M2 microglia negatively affected cell viability, IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion, together with increased early apoptosis in CD8+T lymphocytes via TGFβ1. Additionally, glioma cells were implanted into mouse brains, and we confirmed that S100A9 stimulated microglial M2 polarization, enhanced TGFβ1 levels and repressed CD8+ T lymphocytes in orthotopically transplanted tumors. In human glioma samples, S100A9 expression was positively associated with CD206 expression, but negatively correlated with CD8+T lymphocyte accumulation in the TME. Our data indicated that glioma-derived S100A9 has a promising ability to manipulate non-malignant cells and promote immune evasion in the TME, providing valuable insight into the mechanism by which S100A9 participates in the progression of glioma.

Abstract: Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Although the treatment and survival rate of BC are being improved, the risk factors and the underlying mechanisms causing BC are incompletely understood. Squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) has been associated with the occurrence and development of multiple cancers but whether it contributes to BC development is unclear. In this study, we performed bioinformatics analysis on paired BC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues and found that SQLE expression is significantly upregulated in BC samples. Knockdown of SQLE impairs viability, induces apoptosis, and inhibits the migration and invasion of BC cells. RNA-seq data reveals that SQLE deficiency leads to dysregulated expression of genes regulating proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Mass spectrometry-directed interactome screening identifies proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an SQLE-interacting protein and overexpression of PCNA partially rescues the impaired viability, migration, and invasion of BC cells caused by SQLE knockdown. In addition, we performed xenograft assays and confirmed that SQLE deficiency inhibits BC growth in vivo. In conclusion, these data suggest that SQLE promotes BC development and SQLE inhibition may be therapeutically useful in BC treatment.

Abstract: Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) are a broad and varied group of disorders that affect the brain and are characterized by epilepsy and comorbid intellectual disability (ID). These conditions have a broad spectrum of symptoms and can be caused by various underlying factors, including genetic mutations, infections, and other medical conditions. The exact cause of DEE remains largely unknown in the majority of cases. However, in around 25 % of patients, rare nonsynonymous coding variants in genes encoding ion channels, cell-surface receptors, and other neuronally expressed proteins are identified. This review focuses on a subgroup of DEE patients carrying variations in the gene encoding the Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 (TRPM3) ion channel, where recent data indicate that gain-of-function of TRPM3 channel activity underlies a spectrum of dominant neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) is a major route for protein degradation and a key regulatory mechanism in mammalian cells. UPP inhibitors, including TAK-243, a first-in-class inhibitor of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, are currently being used and tested for treatment of a range of diseases, particularly cancer. Here, we reveal that TAK-243 has major effects on Ca2+ handling in a range of cultured mammalian cells (αT3, HeLa and SH-SY5Y). Effects were seen on agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization, basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels, Ca2+ leak from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), store-operated Ca2+ entry and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. These effects correlated with induction of ER stress, as measured by PERK activation / eIF2α phosphorylation, and most seemed to be underpinned by enhanced Ca2+ leak from the ER. Overall, these data indicate that TAK-243 reprograms the Ca2+-handling properties of mammalian cells and that these effects should be considered when UPP inhibitors are employed as therapeutic agents.

Abstract: Our work is primarily driven by the absence of optical parameters for p-type Ge wafers, adaptable to any specific doping value, and, at the same time, able to cover any application from infrared to ultraviolet regime. To address this, we have determined the complex refractive indices of p-type commercial Ge wafers through a wide spectral range (200–25000 nm) employing spectroscopic ellipsometry and transmittance measurements. The doping levels in these wafers vary between 1015 and 1018 cm−3, which are most commonly used in photovoltaic, thermophotovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. Our data fitting procedure resulted in a dielectric function that successfully reproduces not only the critical points associated with interband transitions above the bandgap, but also absorption features below the bandgap connected to intraband processes. Consequently, we obtained the complex refraction indices of these Ge wafers as a function of dopant concentration, and these have been corroborated through experimental reflectance and transmittance measurements. Additionally, we achieved a successful validation of these refractive indices by simulating the external quantum efficiency of Ge single-junction solar cell with two different thickness fabricated on a Ge wafer with a different doping level than those analyzed in this study.

Abstract: Adenylyl Cyclase 8E (AC8E), which lacks part of M1 transmembrane domain, has been previously shown to dimerize with AC3 and down-regulate its activity, but the molecular mechanism of this inhibitory effect has remained elusive. Here, we first show that AC8E also inhibits AC2 and AC6, highlighting the functional importance of this novel regulatory mechanism in the cAMP signaling pathway across AC families. We then completed the partial structure of Bos taurus AC9 using combinations of comparative modeling and fold recognition methods, and used this as a template to build the first full 3D-models of AC8 and AC8E. These models evidenced that the lack of M1 transmembrane domain of AC8E shifts the N-terminal domain, which impacts the orientation of the helical domains, thus affecting the catalytic site. This was confirmed in living cells with cAMP imaging, where we showed that the N-terminal domain is required for reducing cAMP production. Our data also show that AC8E prevents the translocation of other ACs towards the plasma membrane, further reducing the cAMP responsiveness to extracellular signals. This newly discovered dual inhibitory mechanism provides an additional level of regulation of cAMP-dependent signals integration.

Abstract: Diabetic cardiomyopathy remains a formidable health challenge with a high mortality rate and no targeted treatments. Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) has shown promising effects on cardiovascular diseases; however, its role and the underlying mechanism in regulating diabetic cardiomyopathy remain unclear. In this study, we developed mouse models of diabetic cardiomyopathy using leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice and streptozocin-induced C57BL/6 mice. The diabetic cardiomyopathy model mice exhibited apparent structural damage in cardiac tissues and a significant increase in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. Notably, we observed a significant decreased expression of GDF11 in the myocardium of mice with diabetic cardiomyopathy. Moreover, GDF11 cardiac-specific knock-in mice (transgenic mice) exhibited improved cardiac function and reduced apoptosis. Moreover, exogenous administration of GDF11 mitigated high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GDF11 alleviated high glucose-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of the alkylation repair homolog 5 (ALKBH5)-forkhead box group O3a (FOXO3)-cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 transcript (CDR1as)/Hippo signaling pathway. Consequently, this novel mechanism effectively counteracted myocardial cell apoptosis, providing valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies for clinical diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: Cancer cachexia is a type of energy-wasting syndrome characterized by fatigue, anorexia, muscle weakness, fat loss, and systemic inflammation. Baicalein, a flavonoid with bioactive properties, has demonstrated the ability to mitigate cardiac and skeletal muscle atrophy in different experimental settings. This effect is achieved through the inhibition of muscle proteolysis, suggesting its potential in preserving skeletal muscle homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the anti-cancer cachexia effects of baicalein in the regulation of muscle and fat wasting, both in vivo and in vitro. Baicalein attenuated body weight loss, including skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue (WAT), in CT26-induced cachectic mice. Moreover, baicalein increased muscle fiber thickness and suppressed the muscle-specific ubiquitin-protease system, including F-box only protein 32 and muscle RING-finger protein-1, by activating AKT phosphorylation both in vivo and in vitro. The use of LY294002, a particular inhibitor of AKT, eliminated the observed impact of baicalein on the improvement of muscle atrophy. In conclusion, baicalein inhibits muscle proteolysis and enhances AKT phosphorylation, indicating its potential role in cancer cachexia-associated muscle atrophy.

Abstract: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling has been widely explored as a therapeutic target in cancer. Sphingosine kinase 2 (SK2), one of the kinases that phosphorylate sphingosine, has a cell type and cell location-dependent mechanism of action, so the ability of SK2 to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, proliferation, and survival is strongly influenced by the cell-context. In contrast to SK1, which is widely studied in different types of cancer, including head and neck cancer, the role of SK2 in the development and progression of oral cancer is still poorly understood. In order to elucidate SK2 role in oral cancer, we performed the overexpression of SK2 in non-tumor oral keratinocyte cell (NOK SK2) and in oral squamous cell carcinoma (HN12 SK2), and RNA interference for SK2 in another oral squamous cell carcinoma (HN13 shSK2). In our study we demonstrate for the first time that accumulation of SK2 can be a starting point for oncogenesis and transforms a non-tumor oral keratinocyte (NOK-SI) into highly aggressive tumor cells, even acting on cell plasticity. Furthermore, in oral metastatic cell line (HN12), SK2 contributed even more to the tumorigenesis, inducing proliferation and tumor growth. Our work reveals the intriguing role of SK2 as an oral tumor promoter and regulator of different pathways and cellular processes.

Abstract: Injury to the renal tubular epithelium has emerged as a leading factor underlying the formation of kidney stones. Indeed, epithelial cell damage contributes to the adherence and aggregation of crystals, thereby accelerating the formation of renal stones. Meanwhile, exosomes play an instrumental role in cellular communication, including DNA, RNA, mRNA, etc. In this study, homogenous cells were treated with exosomes derived from damaged cells in an attempt to establish “positive feedback” of cell damage, and the desired results were achieved. To begin, a serum-free medium and supersaturated concentrations of oxalate were added to the HK-2 cell line, and then exosomes were isolated from the two groups for analysis and comparison, and the autophagy-related gene Ambra1 (autophagy and beclin-1 regulator 1) was detected. Subsequently, normal HK-2 cells were treated with exosomes, and the related indexes of autophagy, ferroptosis and mitophagy were determined. Thereafter, Ambra1 was knocked down in exosome-derived HK-2 cells, resulting in the down-regulation of Ambra1 expression in exosomes produced by HK-2 cells following oxalate intervention. Thereafter, the ability of exosomes to stimulate autophagy, mitophagy and ferroptosis was re-evaluated in HK-2 cells after Ambra1 knockdown. The results corroborated that exosomes secreted by oxalate-treated HK-2 can directly elevate autophagy, ferroptosis and mitophagy levels in normal cells, and this effect was significantly mitigated following Ambra1 knockdown within exosomes. Meanwhile, exosomes-induced autophagy and ferroptosis were alleviated after knockdown of beclin-1 in recipient HK-2 cells. These results further suggest that beclin-1 plays a critical role in the process of exosome-induced autophagy-ferroptosis.

Abstract: With the rapid increase in efficiency of organic-inorganic hybrid solar cells of Si-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), their poor stability has become an important factor limiting its further development. Here, we demonstrate that the moisture in the air is the main cause for the performance degradation of the hybrid heterojunction solar cells (HHSCs) and innovatively discovered the effect of the Ag electrodes on the degradation of HHSCs. When exposed to air, the growth of the thin oxide layer on the interface of n-Si/PEDOT:PSS and the formation of silver sulfide (Ag2S) on the Ag/PEDOT:PSS interface together caused the increase in the series resistance (Rs) of the HHSCs. The increase in Rs decreases the fill factor (FF) of the HHSCs and thus leads to the degradation of the cell performance.

Abstract: S. cerevisiae (or budding yeast) is an important micro-organism for sucrose-based fermentation in biotechnology. Yet, it is largely unknown how budding yeast adapts to sucrose transitions. Sucrose can only be metabolized when the invertase or the maltose machinery are expressed and we propose that the Gpr1p receptor signals extracellular sucrose availability via the cAMP peak to adapt cells accordingly. A transition to sucrose or glucose gave a transient cAMP peak which was maximally induced for sucrose. When transitioned to sucrose, cAMP signalling mutants showed an impaired cAMP peak together with a lower growth rate, a longer lag phase and a higher final OD600 compared to a glucose transition. These effects were not caused by altered activity or expression of enzymes involved in sucrose metabolism and imply a more general metabolic adaptation defect. Basal cAMP levels were comparable among the mutant strains, suggesting that the transient cAMP peak is required to adapt cells correctly to sucrose. We propose that the short-term dynamics of the cAMP signalling cascade detects long-term extracellular sucrose availability and speculate that its function is to maintain a fermentative phenotype at continuously low glucose and fructose concentrations.

Abstract: Background
Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is associated with high mortality and has limited therapeutic treatment options. Plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU) plays important roles in tumor cell malignancy. However, the oncogenic role of PLAU in the progression of LUSC remains unknown. GATA-binding factor 6 (GATA6), a key regulator of lung development, inhibits LUSC cell proliferation and migration, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains to be further explored. Moreover, the regulatory effect of GATA6 on PLAU expression has not been reported. The aim of this study was to identify the role of PLAU and the transcriptional inhibition mechanism of GATA6 on PLAU expression in LUSC.
Methods
To identify the potential target genes regulated by GATA6, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained from GEO datasets analysis and RNA-seq experiment were subjected to Venn analysis and correlation heatmap analysis. The transcriptional regulatory effects of GATA6 on PLAU expression were detected by real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The oncogenic effects of PLAU on LUSC cell proliferation and migration were evaluated by EdU incorporation, Matrigel 3D culture and Transwell assays. PLAU expression was detected in tissue microarray of LUSC via immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. To determine prognostic factors for prognosis of LUSC patients, the clinicopathological characteristics and PLAU expression were subjected to univariate Cox regression analysis.
Results
PLAU overexpression promoted LUSC cell proliferation and migration. PLAU is overexpressed in LUSC tissues compared with normal tissues. Consistently, high PLAU expression, which acts as an independent risk factor, is associated with poor prognosis of LUSC patients. Furthermore, the expression of PLAU is transcriptionally regulated by GATA6.
Conclusion
In this work, it was revealed that PLAU is a novel oncogene for LUSC and a new molecular regulatory mechanism of GATA6 in LUSC was unveiled. Targeting the GATA6/PLAU pathway might help in the development of novel therapeutic treatment strategies for LUSC.

Abstract: Sarcopenia is associated with mortality in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) has been suggested to prevent sarcopenia, but reports on its effect on NASH-derived skeletal muscle atrophy in conjunction with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-mediated muscle homeostasis are few. Our aim was to examine the combined effect of the ARB losartan and IGF-1 replacement on skeletal muscle atrophy in a methionine–choline deficient (MCD) diet-fed murine steatohepatitis model. The MCD-fed mice developed steatohepatitis and skeletal muscle atrophy, as indicated by the reduction of psoas muscle mass and attenuation of forelimb and hindlimb grip strength. Significantly suppressed steatohepatitis and skeletal muscle atrophy was observed after single treatment with ARB or IGF-1, and these effects were augmented after combination treatment. Treatment with ARB and IGF-1 effectively inhibited ubiquitin proteasome-mediated protein degradation by reducing forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and FOXO3a transcriptional activity in the skeletal muscle. Combined ARB and IGF-1 decreased the intramuscular expression of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNFα, IL6, and IL1β) and increased the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity and antioxidant enzymes (CAT, GPX1, SOD2, and CYTB). This antioxidant effect was based on downregulation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2, normalization of mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics. Moreover, ARB increased the hepatic and plasma IGF-1 levels and improved steatohepatitis, leading to enhanced skeletal muscle protein synthesis mediated by IGF-1/ AKT/ mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling. Collectively, combined ARB and IGF-1 replacement could be a promising new therapeutic target for NASH-derived skeletal muscle wasting.

Abstract: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a key regulator of energy metabolism. Recent studies suggested that serum FGF21 levels increase with declining renal function. However, the link between FGF21 and kidney diseases and the direct effect of FGF21 in renal fibrosis remains unclear. In this study, FGF21 was upregulated in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal fibrosis and cellular fibrosis induced by transforming growth factor-β, and renal expression of FGF21 was positively correlated with fibrosis markers. Additionally, FGF21 was regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The knockdown and overexpression of FGF21 in mouse tubular epithelial cells demonstrated that FGF21 alleviates renal fibrosis by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. To investigate the effect of FGF21 on renal fibrosis in vivo, we established an overexpression model by injecting the plasmid in mice and found that FGF21 overexpression relieved UUO-induced renal fibrosis and renal inflammatory response. Taken together, FGF21 is upregulated with the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and alleviates renal fibrosis by inhibiting the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in a negative feedback mode. These results provide a new understanding for the source of elevated serum FGF21 in patients with chronic kidney disease and prove that FGF21 is a direct inhibitor of the progression of renal fibrosis, thus providing novel therapeutic intervention insights for renal fibrosis.

Abstract: The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) plays a central role in cellular energy metabolism by producing ATP. In this study, an in silico analysis conducted on nuclear somatically expressed Drosophila melanogaster OXPHOS genes, revealed shared features including widespread expression, presence of Nuclear Respiratory Gene (NRG) elements, and coordinated developmental-dependent expression, with two distinct peaks of expression during late embryonic and pupal stages. In contrast, OXPHOS paralog genes showed a unique pupal peak and were primarily expressed in adult testes. Furthermore, we conducted an extensive characterization of D. melanogaster mitochondrial phosphate carrier (Mpcp), a key player of OXPHOS. In Drosophila two genes, CG9090 and CG4994, encode putative Mpcp known as Mpcp1 and Mpcp2. Intriguingly, the expression patterns of Mpcps during development exhibited significant differences from each other and from those of other OXPHOS genes. This suggests that both isoforms contribute to ATP synthesis and are essential for the full organism development, with CG9090 also showing a connection with lifespan and aging processes. Functional complementation assays, swelling experiments carried out in the yeast mir1∆ strain and an extensive kinetic characterization of recombinant mature Mpcp2 confirmed that both isoforms transport phosphate. However, Mpcp1 displays a three folds lower activity compared to Mpcp2. Collectively, these findings suggest that mMpcp1 and mMpcp2 operate similarly to mammalian PiC-A and PiC-B, respectively. This provides a basis for exploring functional differences in mammals and gaining new insights into the mechanisms underlying OXPHOS-related diseases associated to deficiencies in human PiC transporters.

Abstract: The development of low bandgap GaAsNBi solar cells grown using MBE is reported. The devices include a pin heterostructure with GaAsNBi as the i-layer. The substrate rotation is stopped during epitaxy of the GaAsNBi layer (stationary growth), resulting in a continuous variation in the source fluxes over the wafer, enabling the investigation of a wide range of growth conditions in a single growth run. In particular, we investigate the photovoltaic properties as a function of the As/Ga flux ratio around the critical stoichiometric value. For slightly below stoichiometric As/Ga, the lattice mismatch and bandgap energy are minimized to 8 × 10-4 and 0.86 eV, respectively, while the crystal quality remains good. Increasing As/Ga over the stoichiometric ratio leads to a rapid increase in the tensile mismatch and bandgap energy, likely due to reduction in Bi incorporation. Despite a slightly higher open-circuit voltage offset at high As/Ga, this also leads to an clear increase in the external quantum efficiency and short-circuit current, suggesting significant differences in the carrier collection efficiencies. The results demonstrate the importance of the As/Ga flux ratio in controlling the solar cell performance, and the viability of GaAsNBi as a candidate for a low bandgap subjunction in multijunction solar cells.

Abstract: Though burgeoning research manifests that cell competition, an essential selection and quality control mechanism for maintaining tissue or organ growth and homeostasis in multicellular organisms, is closely related to tumorigenesis and development, the mechanism of cell competition associated with tumor drug resistance remains elusive. In the study, we uncovered that oxaliplatin-resistant hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells exhibit a pronounced competitive advantage against their sensitive counterparts, which is related to lipid takeover of resistant cells from sensitive cells. Of note, such lipid takeover is dependent on the existence of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) in resistant HCC cells. Mechanistically, IDH1 activity is regulated by heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90α) through binding with each other, which orchestrates the expressions of lipid metabolic enzymes and lipid accumulation in resistant HCC cells. Our results suggest that HCC cell competition-driven chemoresistance can be regulated by HSP90α/IDH1-mediated lipid metabolism, which may serve as a promising target for overcoming drug resistance in HCC.

Abstract: Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is an enzyme that is involved in the regulation of lipolysis in the heart. SCD1 also affects epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA and histone modifications, in various tissues. Both epigenetic modifications and changes in lipid metabolism are involved in the heart's response to hypoxia. The present study tested the hypothesis that SCD1 and epigenetic modifications interact to control lipolysis in cardiomyocytes under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We found that the inhibition of SCD1 activity and loss of SCD1 expression reduced global DNA methylation levels, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity, and DNMT1 expression in HL-1 cardiomyocytes and the mouse heart. We also found that the inhibition of adipose triglyceride lipase is involved in the control of global DNA methylation levels in cardiomyocytes in an SCD1-independent manner. Additionally, SCD1 inhibition reduced expression of the hormone-sensitive lipase (Lipe) gene through an increase in methylation of the Lipe gene promoter. Under hypoxic conditions, SCD1 inhibition abolished hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1α, likely through decreases in histone deacetylase, protein kinase A, and abhydrolase domain containing 5 protein levels, leading to the attenuation of DNA hypomethylation by DNMT1. Hypoxia led to demethylation of the Lipe promoter in cardiomyocytes with SCD1 inhibition, which increased Lipe expression. These results indicate that SCD1 is involved in the control of epigenetic mechanisms in the heart and may affect Lipe expression through changes in methylation in its promoter region. Therefore, SCD1 may be considered a key player in the epigenetic response to normoxia and hypoxia in cardiomyocytes.

Abstract: In this work, Au NPs were produced by laser ablation in liquids method (LASis) in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and processed onto the Spiro-OMeTAD (hole transport layer,HTL) in perovskite solar cells. Spiro-OMeTAD requires the use of additives to improve its electrical features, and these additives include the hygroscopic LiTFSI to promote the oxidation of this HTL. AFM images pointed out that the TFSI− precipitates along the surface of Spiro-OMeTAD with the aging time, thus resulting in reduced stability for devices operating in the air. Therefore, to avoid this problem, two procedures were adopted: washing the surface of Spiro-OMeTAD with IPA or processing the Au NPs onto the surface of Spiro-OMeTAD from IPA suspension. Both procedures were performed by spin coating method prior to the deposition of the top electrode. The photovoltaic response showed that the devices produced with modified HTL presented superior stability mainly due to the removal of TFSI− precipitates from the surface of the Spiro-OMeTAD and the residual excess of TFSI− that can be chemically adsorbed onto the gold surface via oxygen atoms.

Abstract: The dynamic interface between invading viral pathogens and programmed cell death (PCD) of the host is a finely regulated process. Host cellular demise at the end of the viral life cycle ensures the release of progeny virions to initiate new infection cycles. Rotavirus (RV), a diarrheagenic virus with double-stranded RNA genome, has been reported to trigger different types of PCD such as apoptosis and pyroptosis in a highly regulated way to successfully disseminate progeny virions. Recently our lab also showed that induction of MLKL-driven programmed necroptosis by RV. However, the host cellular machinery involved in RV-induced necroptosis and the upstream viral trigger responsible for it remained unaddressed. In the present study, the signalling upstream of MLKL-driven necroptosis has been delineated where the involvement of Receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 3 (RIPK3) and 1 (RIPK1) from the host side and RV non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) as the viral trigger for necroptosis has been shown. Interestingly, RV-NSP4 was found to be an integral component of the necrosome complex by interacting with RIPK1, thereby bypassing the requirement of RIPK1 kinase activity. Subsequently, NSP4-driven elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and Ca2+-binding to NSP4 lead further to RHIM domain-dependent RIPK1-RIPK3 interaction, RIPK3-dependent MLKL phosphorylation, and eventual necroptosis. Overall, this study presents the interplay between RV-NSP4 and the host cellular necrosome complex to induce necroptotic death of host cells.

Abstract: Broadband absorption of the solar spectrum is a prerequisite to any photovoltaic technology. Subwavelength arrays are known to provide various mechanisms for broadband and omnidirectional absorption of the solar spectrum. In the current work we examine optical absorption in NP arrays decorated with SiO2 quasi-nanolenses (qNL arrays), which numerically exhibit 10–15 % increase in broadband absorption. Specifically, near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) is employed to probe the underlying optical absorption mechanisms. Two NSOM methods are employed for the investigation: 1) far-field imaging using near-field excitation which allows the determination as to the origin of the reflected far-field photons, and 2) far-field excitation and near-field scanning to measure the lateral optical propagations in the arrays. We show that the enhanced optical absorption in qNL arrays is due to combination of three mechanisms: 1) each qNL serves as an effective anti-reflection coating, 2) the presence of qNLs increases the optical interactions between the adjacent dielectrics to conclude elevated levels of light trapping, and 3) the presence of qNL induces strong light concentration of the incoming radiation into the dielectric structures.

Abstract: The need to reduce the silver consumption for future global PV production requires novel approaches for cell metallization and module integration. A screen-printed aluminum cell metallization on the front side could contribute here, but requires a redesign of the solder pads and busbars. A compromise between shading and resistive losses is needed. We investigate the inclusion of Ag solder pads in high-aspect-ratio Al finger grids on the front side of p-type back junction solar cells featuring passivating polysilicon on oxide (POLO) contacts on the rear side. In order to determine the optimal geometric dimensions of the solder pads, we characterize the resistance at the interface between the Ag solder pads and the Al finger grid in dependence on the size of the overlap between the two paste. A contact resistance of 285 mΩ is determined for 200 μm-narrow Al busbars and small solder pads of 750 μm in length. This would require tens of solder pads per busbar for acceptable power losses below 0.5 % coming along with significant shading. Therefore, a new metallization design is developed. We use narrow Ag busbars with a widened intersection to the Al fingers in order to reduce the contact resistance caused by the Ag–Al alloy. Thereby, the shading losses of the solderable busbars and pads are less than 1.5 %.

The human testis-enriched HSPA2 interacts with HIF-1α in epidermal keratinocytes, yet HIF-1α stability and HIF-1-dependent gene expression rely on the HSPA (HSP70) activity,

Abstract: The Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) is essential for cellular adaptation to reduced oxygen levels. It also facilitates the maintenance and re-establishment of skin homeostasis. Among others, it is involved in regulating keratinocyte differentiation. The stability of the oxygen-liable HIF-1α subunit is regulated by various non-canonical oxygen-independent mechanisms, which among others involve Heat Shock Proteins of the A family (HSPA/HSP70). This group of highly homologous chaperones and proteostasis-controlling factors includes HSPA2, a unique member crucial for spermatogenesis and implicated in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation. HIF-1 can control the HSPA2 gene expression. In this study, we revealed that HIF-1α is the first confirmed client of HSPA2 in human somatic cells. It colocalises and interacts directly with HSPA2 in the epidermis in situ and immortalised keratinocytes in vitro. Using an in vitro model based on HSPA2-overexpressing and HSPA2-deficient variants of immortalised keratinocytes we showed that changes in HSPA2 levels do not affect the levels and intracellular localisation of HIF-1α or influence the ability of HIF-1 to modulate target gene expression. However, HIF-1α stability in keratinocytes appears critically reliant on HSPAs as a group of functionally overlapping chaperones. In addition to HSPA2, HIF-1α colocalises and forms complexes with HSPA8 and HSPA1, representing housekeeping and stress-inducible HSPA family paralogs, respectively. Chemical inhibition of HSPA activity, but not paralog-specific knockdown of HSPA8 or HSPA1 expression reduced HIF-1α levels and HIF-1-dependent gene expression. These observations suggest that pharmacological targeting of HSPAs could prevent excessive HIF-1 signalling in pathological skin conditions.

EGCG-induced selective death of cancer cells through autophagy-dependent regulation of the p62-mediated antioxidant survival pathway,

Abstract: The effects of EGCG on the selective death of cancer cells by modulating antioxidant pathways through autophagy were explored in various normal and cancer cells. EGCG positively regulated the p62-KEAP1-NRF2-HO-1 pathway in normal cells, while negatively regulating it in cancer cells, leading to selective apoptotic death of cancer cells. In EGCG-treated MRC5 cells (EGCG-MRC5), autophagic flux was blocked, which was accompanied by the formation of p62-positive aggregates. However, EGCG-treated HeLa cells (EGCG-HeLa) showed incomplete autophagic flux and no aggregate formation. The levels of P-ULK1 S556 and S758 increased in EGCG-MRC5 through AMPK-mTOR cooperative interaction. In contrast, EGCG treatment in HeLa cells led to AMPK-induced mTOR inactivation, resulting in abrogation of P-ULK1 S556 and S758 levels. AMPK knockout in EGCG-HeLa restored positive regulation of the p62-mediated pathway, which was accompanied by increased P-mTOR S2448 and P-ULK1 S758 levels. Knockdown of 67LR in EGCG-HeLa abolished AMPK activity but did not restore the p62-mediated pathway. Surprisingly, both AMPK knockout and 67LR knockdown in EGCG-HeLa markedly increased cell viability, despite differential regulation of the antioxidant enzyme HO-1. In conclusion, EGCG induces the selective death of cancer cells through the modulation of at least two autophagy-dependent and independent regulatory pathways: negative regulation involves the mTOR-ULK1 (S556 and S758)-p62-KEAP1-NRF2-HO-1 axis via AMPK activation, whereas positive regulation occurs through the 67LR-AMPK axis.

Abstract: Leishmania donovani is an auxotroph for heme. Parasite acquires heme by clathrin-mediated endocytosis of hemoglobin by specific receptor. However, the regulation of receptor recycling pathway is not known in Leishmania. Here, we have cloned, expressed and characterized the Rab4 homologue from L. donovani. We have found that LdRab4 localizes in both early endosomes and Golgi in L. donovani. To understand the role of LdRab4 in L. donovani, we have generated transgenic parasites overexpressing GFP-LdRab4:WT, GFP-LdRab4:Q67L, and GFP-LdRab4:S22N. Our results have shown that overexpression of GFP-LdRab4:Q67L or GFP-LdRab4:S22N does not alter the cell surface localization of hemoglobin receptor in L. donovani. Surprisingly, we have found that overexpression of GFP-LdRab4:S22N significantly blocks the transport of Ldgp63 to the cell surface whereas the trafficking of Ldgp63 is induced to the cell surface in GFP-LdRab4:WT and GFP-LdRab4:Q67L overexpressing parasites. Consequently, we have found significant inhibition of gp63 secretion by GFP-LdRab4:S22N overexpressing parasites whereas secretion of Ldgp63 is enhanced in GFP-LdRab4:WT and GFP-LdRab4:Q67L overexpressing parasites in comparison to untransfected control parasites. Moreover, we have found that survival of transgenic parasites overexpressing GFP-LdRab4:S22N is severely compromised in macrophages in comparison to GFP-LdRab4:WT and GFP-LdRab4:Q67L expressing parasites. These results demonstrated that LdRab4 unconventionally regulates the secretory pathway in L. donovani.

Abstract: Lenvatinib is the first-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC, however, drug resistance cannot be avoided during the treatment process, limiting the efficacy of Lenvatinib. We constructed drug-resistant HCC cells by gradually increasing the dose of Lenvatinib. The study found for the first time that USP22 and JMJD8 are upregulated in Lenvatinib resistant HCC cells. In addition, the expression level of stemness related proteins (CD133, C-MYC, BMI1, β-CATENIN) in drug-resistant cells was higher than that in wild-type HCC cells. Knockdown of USP22 in drug-resistant HCC cells could reduce the invasion, migration and stemness of cells. Next, we explored the mechanism of USP22 in Lenvatinib resistance of HCC cells. Under the treatment of Lenvatinib, USP22 knockdown inhibited the cell viability of drug-resistant HCC cells and promoted the apoptosis of drug-resistant cells. Animal experiments in nude mice further demonstrated the important role of USP22 in inducing the resistance of HCC to Lenvatinib in vivo. More importantly, we found that USP22 and JMJD8 constitute a functional axis regulating the drug resistance of Lenvatinib in HCC. In the rescue experiment, the overexpression of JMJD8 could reduce the apoptosis induced by USP22 knockdown. In general, this study shows that USP22-JMJD8 is a drug design target for the mechanism of Lenvatinib resistance in HCC, which may improve the long-term efficacy of Lenvatinib.

Abstract: Diet-based models are commonly used to investigate obesity and related disorders. We conducted a comparative profiling of three obesogenic diets HFD, high fat diet; HFHF, high fat high fructose diet; and HFCD, high fat choline deficient diet to assess their impact on the gut microbiome and metabolome. After 20 weeks, we analyzed the gut microbiota and metabolomes of liver, plasma, cecal, and fecal samples. Fecal and plasma bile acids (BAs) and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were also examined. Significant changes were observed in fecal and cecal metabolites, with increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes in the HFD, HFHF, and HFCD-fed mice compared to chow and LFD (low fat diet)-fed mice. Most BAs were reduced in plasma and fecal samples of obese groups, except taurocholic acid, which increased in HFCD mice's plasma. SCFAs like acetate and butyrate significantly decreased in obesogenic diet groups, while propionic acid specifically decreased in the HFCD group. Pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in amino acid, carbohydrate metabolism, and nucleic acid biosynthesis pathways in obese mice. Surprisingly, even LFD-fed mice showed distinct changes in microbiome and metabolite profiles compared to the chow group. This study provides insights into gut microbiome dysbiosis and metabolite alterations induced by obesogenic and LFD diets in various tissues. These findings aid in selecting suitable diet models to study the role of the gut microbiome and metabolites in obesity and associated disorders, with potential implications for understanding similar pathologies in humans.

Abstract: Efficient protein synthesis is a basic requirement of our cells to replace the old or defective proteins from the intrinsic crowded biomolecular environment. The interconnection among synthesis, folding, and degradation of proteins represents central paradigm to proteostasis. Failure of protein quality control (PQC) mechanisms results in the disturbance and inadequate functions of proteome. The consequent misfolded protein accumulation can form the basis of neurodegeneration onset and largely represents imperfect aging. Understanding how cells improve the function of deregulated PQC mechanisms to establish and maintain proteostasis against the unwanted sequestration of normal proteins with misfolded proteinaceous inclusions is a major challenge. Here we show that treatment of Lanosterol, a cholesterol synthesis pathway intermediate, induces Proteasome proteolytic activities and, therefore, supports the PQC mechanism for the elimination of intracellular aberrant proteins. The exposure of Lanosterol not only promotes Proteasome catalytic functions but also elevates the removal of both bona fide and neurodegenerative diseases associated toxic proteins. Our current study suggests that increasing Proteasome functions with the help of small molecules such as Lanosterol could serve as a cytoprotective therapeutic approach against abnormal protein accumulation. Cumulatively, based on findings in this study, we can understand the critical importance of small molecules and their potential therapeutic influence in re-establishing disturbed proteostasis linked with neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear ligand-activated receptor of bile acids that plays a role in the modulation of insulin content. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Forkhead box a2 (Foxa2) is an important nuclear transcription factor in pancreatic β-cells and is involved in β-cell function. We aimed to explore the signaling mechanism downstream of FXR to regulate insulin content and underscore its association with Foxa2 and insulin gene (Ins) transcription. All experiments were conducted on FXR transgenic mice, INS-1 823/13 cells, and diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats undergoing sham or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Islets from FXR knockout mice and INS-1823/13 cells with FXR knockdown exhibited substantially lower insulin levels than that of controls. This was accompanied by decreased Foxa2 expression and Ins transcription. Conversely, FXR overexpression increased insulin content, concomitant with enhanced Foxa2 expression and Ins transcription in INS-1 823/13 cells. Moreover, FXR knockdown reduced FXR recruitment and H3K27 trimethylation in the Foxa2 promoter. Importantly, Foxa2 overexpression abrogated the adverse effects of FXR knockdown on Ins transcription and insulin content in INS-1 823/13 cells. Notably, RYGB surgery led to improved insulin content in diabetic GK rats, which was accompanied by upregulated FXR and Foxa2 expression and Ins transcription. Collectively, these data suggest that Foxa2 serves as the target gene of FXR in β-cells and mediates FXR-enhanced Ins transcription. Additionally, the upregulated FXR/Foxa2 signaling cascade could contribute to the enhanced insulin content in diabetic GK rats after RYGB.

Abstract: Polyolefin elastomers (POE) have been established as a promising alternative to commonly used peroxide crosslinked ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) photovoltaic encapsulation materials. The main objective of this work was to assess the long-term ageing behavior of double-glass laminates based on UV-transparent EVA and POE under damp heat (85 °C, 85 %rh) conditions for up to 10,000h. Ageing induced changes were characterized by microscopy, UV–visible–near infrared (UVVISNIR) spectroscopy, compressive shear testing (CST), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), macro- and microscopic Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Within the laminates, the formation of birefringent spheric microdomains (maltese-crosses) was confirmed after an exposure time of more than 2,000h. The compressive shear behavior of EVA laminates was not significantly affected by damp heat ageing. Interestingly, the POE laminates revealed an even improved compressive shear performance. Whereas the tested EVA laminates failed in an interfacial manner independent on damp heat ageing time, POE laminates exhibited a failure mode transition from interfacial (unaged) to combined interfacial and cohesive (10,000h). On the interfacially fractured surfaces of EVA and POE laminates, carboxylic acid groups were ascertained. Deprotonated silanol and water bands were discernible on the opposite glass sides. Damp heat exposure of POE laminates for 10,000h resulted in pronounced glass ageing close to the interface associated with a partly cohesive failure within glass. This phenomenon was quite different to EVA and was attributed to the alkaline characteristics of the hindered amine light (HALS) stabilized, less-polar, UV-transparent POE encapsulant.

Abstract: The molecular mechanisms behind electrotaxis remain largely unknown, with no identified primary direct current electric field (dcEF) sensor. Two leading hypotheses propose mechanisms involving the redistribution of charged components in the cell membrane (driven by electrophoresis or electroosmosis) and the asymmetric activation of ion channels. To investigate these mechanisms, we studied the dynamics of electrotactic behaviour of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. We observed that 3T3 fibroblasts exhibit cathodal migration within just 1 min when exposed to physiological dcEF. This rapid response suggests the involvement of ion channels in the cell membrane. Our large-scale screening method identified several ion channel genes as potential key players, including the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.2. Blocking the Kir channel family with Ba2+ or silencing the Kcnj15 gene, encoding Kir4.2, significantly reduced the directional migration of 3T3 cells. Additionally, the levels of the intracellular regulators of Kir channels, spermine (SPM) and spermidine (SPD), had a significant impact on cell directionality. Interestingly, inhibiting Kir4.2 resulted in the temporary cessation of electrotaxis for approximately 1–2 h before its return. This observation suggests a two-phase mechanism for the electrotaxis of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, where ion channel activation triggers the initial rapid response to dcEF, and the subsequent redistribution of membrane receptors sustains long-term directional movement. In summary, our study unveils the involvement of Kir channels and proposes a biphasic mechanism to explain the electrotactic behaviour of mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of electrotaxis.

L-Dopa decarboxylase modulates autophagy in hepatocytes and is implicated in dengue virus-caused inhibition of autophagy completion,

Abstract: The enzyme L-Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC) synthesizes the catecholamine dopamine and the indolamine serotonin. Apart from its role in the brain as a neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzyme, DDC has been detected also in the liver and other peripheral organs, where it is implicated in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and host-virus interactions. Dengue virus (DENV) suppresses DDC expression at the later stages of infection, during which DENV also inhibits autophagosome-lysosome fusion. As dopamine affects autophagy in neuronal cells, we investigated the possible association of DDC with autophagy in human hepatocytes and examined whether DDC mediates the relationship between DENV infection and autophagy. We performed DDC silencing/overexpression and evaluated autophagic markers upon induction of autophagy, or suppression of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Our results showed that DDC favored the autophagic process, at least in part, through its biosynthetic function, while knockdown of DDC or inhibition of DDC enzymatic activity prevented autophagy completion. In turn, autophagy induction upregulated DDC, while autophagy reduction by chemical or genetic (ATG14L knockout) ways caused the opposite effect. This study also implicated DDC with the cellular energetic status, as DDC silencing reduced the oxidative phosphorylation activity of the cell. We also report that upon DDC silencing, the repressive effect of DENV on the completion of autophagy was enhanced, and the inhibition of autolysosome formation did not exert an additive effect on viral proliferation. These data unravel a novel role of DDC in the autophagic process and suggest that DENV downregulates DDC expression to inhibit the completion of autophagy, reinforcing the importance of this protein in viral infections.

Abstract: Prostate cancer is the most common malignant tumor in males, which frequently develops into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC metastasis is the main reason for its high mortality rate. At present, it lacks effective treatment for patients with CRPC. Raltitrexed (RTX) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of colorectal cancer. However, the effect of RTX on prostate cancer and the underlying mechanism remain unknown. In the current study, we found that RTX could dose-dependently inhibit proliferation, migration, colony formation and induce apoptosis in DU145 and PC-3 cells. RTX also increased ROS generation in prostate cancer cells. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly prevented RTX-induced cell apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling activation in prostate cancer cells. Additionally, we found RTX-induced ROS generation and ER stress activation depended on the expression of heat shock protein family A member 8 (HSPA8). Over-expression of HSPA8 could alleviate RTX-induced cell apoptosis, ROS generation and ER stress signaling activation. Finally, our study also showed that RTX attenuated the tumor growth of prostate cancer in the DU145 xenograft model and significantly downregulated HSPA8 expression and activated ER stress signaling pathway in tumor tissues. Our study is the first to reveal that RTX induces prostate cancer cells apoptosis through inhibiting the expression of HSPA8 and further inducing ROS-mediated ER stress pathway action. This study suggests that RTX may be a novel promising candidate drug for prostate cancer therapy.

Abstract: Liver cancer is ranked as the sixth most prevalent from of malignancy globally and stands as the third primary contributor to cancer-related mortality. Metastasis is the main reason for liver cancer treatment failure and patient deaths. Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) serves as a crucial substrate junction protein within the cullin-RING E3 ligase complex, acting as a significant tumor suppressor in liver cancer. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanism underlying the role of SPOP in liver cancer metastasis remain elusive. In the current study, we identified cAMP response element binding 5 (CREB5) as a novel SPOP substrate in liver cancer. SPOP facilitates non-degradative K63-polyubiquitination of CREB5 on K432 site, consequently hindering its capacity to activate receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Moreover, liver cancer-associated SPOP mutant S119N disrupts the SPOP-CREB5 interactions and impairs the ubiquitination of CREB5.This disruption ultimately leads to the activation of the MET signaling pathway and enhances metastatic properties of hepatoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our findings highlight the functional significance of the SPOP-CREB5-MET axis in liver cancer metastasis.

Abstract: Adipose tissue fibrosis has been identified as a novel contributor to the pathomechanism of obesity associated metabolic disorders. Sulforaphane (SFN) has been shown to have an anti-obesity effect. However, the impact of SFN on adipose tissue fibrosis is still not well understood. In this study, obese mice induced by high-fat diets (HFD) were used to examine the effects of SFN on adipose tissue fibrosis. According to the current findings, SFN dramatically enhanced glucose tolerance and decreased body weight in diet-induced-obesity (DIO) mice. Additionally, SFN therapy significantly reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and altered the expression of genes related to fibrosis. Furthermore, SFN also reduced inflammation and promoted macrophages polarization towards to M2 phenotype in adipose tissue, which protected adipose tissue from fibrosis. Notably, SFN-mediated nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation was crucial in decreasing adipose tissue fibrosis. These results implied that SFN had favorable benefits in adipose tissue fibrosis, which consequently ameliorates obesity-related metabolic problems. Our research provides new treatment strategies for obesity and associated metabolic disorders.

Abstract: The integrated landscape of ferroptosis regulatory patterns and their association with colon microenvironment have been demonstrated in recent studies. However, the ferroptosis-related immunotherapeutic signature for colon cancer (CC) remains unclear. We comprehensively evaluated 1623 CC samples, identified patterns of ferroptosis modification based on ferroptosis-associated genes, and systematically correlated these patterns with tumor microenvironment (TME) cell infiltration characteristics. In addition, the ferroptosis-regulated gene score (FRG-score) was constructed to quantify the pattern of ferroptosis alterations in individual tumors. Three distinct patterns of ferroptosis modification were identified, including antioxidant defense, iron toxicity, and lipid peroxidation. The characteristics of TME cell infiltration under these three patterns were highly consistent with the three immune phenotypes of tumors, including immune-inflamed, immune-excluded and immune-desert phenotypes. We also demonstrated that evaluation of ferroptosis regulatory patterns within individual tumors can predict tumor inflammatory status, tumor subtype, TME stromal activity, genetic variation, and clinical outcome. Immunotherapy cohorts confirmed that patients with low FRG-scores showed remarkable therapeutic and clinical benefits. Furthermore, the hub gene apolipoprotein L6 (APOL6), a drug-sensitive target associated with cancer cell ferroptosis, was identified through our proposed novel key gene screening process and validated in CC cell lines and scRNA-seq.

Abstract: The bacterial magnesium transporter A (MgtA) is a specialized P-type ATPase important for Mg2+ import into the cytoplasm; disrupted magnesium homeostasis is linked to intrinsic ribosome instability and antibacterial resistance in Salmonella strains. Here, we show that MgtA has functional specificity for cardiolipin 18:1. Still, it reaches maximum activity only in combination with cardiolipin 16:0, equivalent to the major components of native cardiolipin found in E. coli membranes. Native mass spectrometry indicates the presence of two binding sites for cardiolipin, agreeing with the kinetic studies revealing that a cooperative relationship likely exists between the two cardiolipin variants. This is the first experimental evidence of cooperative effects between lipids of the same class, with only minor variations in their acyl chain composition, acting on a membrane protein. In summary, our results reveal that MgtA exhibits a highly complex interaction with one cardiolipin 18:1 and one cardiolipin 16:0, affecting protein activity and stability, contributing to our understanding of the particular interactions between lipid environment and membrane proteins. Further, a better understanding of Mg2+ homeostasis in bacteria, due to its role as a virulence regulator, will provide further insights into the regulation and mechanism of bacterial infections.

Abstract: Copper (Cu) dyshomeostasis has been linked to obesity and related morbidities and also to aging. Cu levels are higher in older or obese individuals, and adipose tissue (AT) Cu levels correlate with body mass index. Aging and obesity induce similar AT functional and structural changes, including an accumulation of senescent cells. To study the effect of Cu-mediated stress-induced premature senescent (Cu-SIPS) on preadipocytes, 3T3-L1 cell line was exposed to a subcytotoxic concentration of copper sulfate. After Cu treatment, preadipocytes acquired typical senescence characteristics including diminished cell proliferation, cell and nuclei enlargement and increased lysosomal mass (higher Lamp2 expression and a slight increased number of cells positive for β-galactosidase associated with senescence (SA-β-Gal)). Cell cycle arrest was due to upregulation of p16Ink4aInk4a and p21Waf1/Cip1. Accordingly, protein levels of the proliferation marker KI67 were reduced. Cu-SIPS relates with oxidative stress and, in this context, an increase of SOD1 and HO-1 expression was detected in Cu-treated cells. The mRNA expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors, such as Mmp3, Il-6 and Tnf-α, increased in Cu-SIPS 3T3-L1 cells but no effect was observed on the expression of heterochromatin-associated protein 1(HP1). Although the downregulation of Lamin B1 expression is considered a hallmark of senescence, Cu-SIPS cells presented higher levels of Lamin B1. The dysregulation of nuclear lamina was accompanied by an increase of nuclear blebbing, but not of micronuclei number. To conclude, a Cu-SIPS model in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes is here described, which may be an asset to the study of AT dysregulation observed in obesity and aging.

Abstract: Dengue virus (DENV) envelope protein plays crucial role in virus entry and maturation of virus during infection. Maturation of DENV occurs in the trans Golgi network at slightly acidic pH which is close to pKa of histidine. When exposed to the acidic environment of the late secretory pathway, dengue virus particles go through a significant conformational change, whereby interactions of structural proteins envelope (E) and prM proteins are reorganised and enable furin protease to cleave prM resulting in mature virus. In order to study the role of histidine of E protein in DENV maturation, we mutated 7 conserved histidine residues of envelope protein and assessed the percent of budding using viral like particle (VLP) system. Histidine mutants; H144A, H244A, H261A and H282A severely disrupted VLP formation without any significant change in expression in cell and its oligomerization ability. Treatment with acidotropic amine reversed the defect for all 4 mutants suggesting that these histidines could be involved in maturation and release. Over expression of capsid protein slightly enhanced VLP release of H244A and H261A. Similarly, furin over expression increased VLP release of these mutants. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that prM and E interaction is lost for H244A, H261A and H282A mutants at acidic pH but not at neutral pH indicating that they could be involved in histidine switch during maturation at acidic pH. Detailed analysis of the mutants could provide novel insights on the interplay of envelop protein during maturation and aid in target for drug development.

Abstract: Background
We have previously shown that non-curative chemotherapy imposes fetal conversion and high metastatic capacity to cancer cells. From the set of genes differentially expressed in Chemotherapy Resistant Cells, we obtained a characteristic fetal intestinal cell signature that is present in a group of untreated tumors and is sufficient to predict patient prognosis. A feature of this fetal signature is the loss of CDX1.
Methods
We have analyzed transcriptomic data in public datasets and performed immunohistochemistry analysis of paraffin embedded tumor samples from two cohorts of colorectal cancer patients.
Results
We demonstrated that low levels of CDX1 are sufficient to identify patients with poorest outcome at the early tumor stages II and III. Presence tumor areas that are negative for CDX1 staining in stage I cancers is associated with tumor relapse.
Conclusions
Our results reveal the actual possibility of incorporating CDX1 immunostaining as a valuable biomarker for CRC patients.

Abstract: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) changes are acknowledged as early indicators of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The permeability and integrity of the BBB rely significantly on the essential role played by the tight junction proteins (TJPs) connecting endothelial cells. This study found the reduced RNA binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) expression in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) incubated with Aβ1–42. This downregulation of RBM3 caused a decrease in the levels of ZO-1 and occludin and increased the permeability of BBB cell model in AD microenvironment. Myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) expression was also inhibited in BMECs incubated with Aβ1–42. A decrease in MEF2C expression led to increased permeability of BBB cell model in AD microenvironment and reductions in the levels of ZO-1 and occludin. Further analysis of the underlying mechanism revealed that RBM3 binds to and stabilizes MEF2C mRNA. MEF2C binds to the promoters of ZO-1 and occludin, enhancing their transcriptional activities and modulating BBB permeability. RBM3 increases the stability of MEF2C mRNA and subsequently modulates BBB permeability through the paracellular pathway of TJPs. This may provide new insights for AD research.

Abstract: The optimization of present multijunction junction solar cells and the development of new concepts is an important task for modem photovoltaics. For its development, special attention should be paid to the potential quality of photoactive p-n junctions, as well as to their properties when operating at various temperatures. The present research has shown that for two-diode model of the p-n junction it is convenient to use current invariants Jz1 and Jz2 for calculating the diffusion and recombination saturation dark currents J01 and J02 for p-n junctions based on semiconductor materials with any band-gap energy. It has been experimentally found that Jz1 and Jz2 are constants relating the semiconductor material band gap energy and temperature with J01 and J02. It has also been shown that Jz1 and Jz2 determine the open circuit voltage and the value of voltage offset WOC. Current invariant suggested to be useful tool for evaluating the quality of a p-n junction and for modeling the characteristics of solar cells because it allows making calculations taking into account both main mechanisms of current flow and the operating temperature of the device.

Abstract: Since Nrf1 and Nrf2 are essential for regulating the lipid metabolism pathways, their dysregulation has thus been shown to be critically involved in the non-controllable inflammatory transformation into cancer. Herein, we have explored the molecular mechanisms underlying their distinct regulation of lipid metabolism, by comparatively analyzing the changes in those lipid metabolism-related genes in Nrf1α−/− and/or Nrf2−/− cell lines relative to wild-type controls. The results revealed that loss of Nrf1α leads to lipid metabolism disorders. That is, its lipid synthesis pathway was up-regulated by the JNK-Nrf2-AP1 signaling, while its lipid decomposition pathway was down-regulated by the nuclear receptor PPAR-PGC1 signaling, thereby resulting in severe accumulation of lipids as deposited in lipid droplets. By contrast, knockout of Nrf2 gave rise to decreases in lipid synthesis and uptake capacity. These demonstrate that Nrf1 and Nrf2 contribute to significant differences in the cellular lipid metabolism profiles and relevant pathological responses. Further experimental evidence unraveled that lipid deposition in Nrf1α−/− cells resulted from CD36 up-regulation by activating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, leading to abnormal activation of the inflammatory response. This was also accompanied by a series of adverse consequences, e.g., accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Nrf1α−/− cells. Interestingly, treatment of Nrf1α−/− cells with 2-bromopalmitate (2BP) enabled the yield of lipid droplets to be strikingly alleviated, as accompanied by substantial abolishment of CD36 and critical inflammatory cytokines. Such Nrf1α−/− -led inflammatory accumulation of lipids, as well as ROS, was significantly ameliorated by 2BP. Overall, this study provides a potential strategy for cancer prevention and treatment by precision targeting of Nrf1, Nrf2 alone or both.

Abstract: The quality of perovskite films plays a vital role in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Additive engineering has been proven to be an effective strategy for reducing defects in perovskite films. In this study, a betaine-based zwitterionic molecule, [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide (denoted as SBMA), is employed as an additive in p-i-n PSCs. SBMA can passivate the defects in two ways: (1) The ester groups and SO32− passivate the positively charged defects. (2) Quaternary ammonium ions can passivate the negatively charged defects. The addition of SBMA reduces the trap density in the perovskite films, and therefore, nonradiative recombination is effectively suppressed. A champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 21.39% for p-i-n PSCs based on CH3NH3PbI3 is achieved, and the thermal and humidity stability is improved. Moreover, when the active area was increased to 0.27 cm2 and 1.1 cm2, the device with SBMA could achieve PCEs of 20.18% and 18.43%, respectively.

Abstract: This work addresses the solderability and the reliability of n-type IBC ZEBRA cells with screen printed copper paste busbars. Improvement of the solderability by Sn60Pb40 solder alloy coated PV ribbon using an industrial automated IR stringer is reported. For qualification of the module reliability, climate chamber thermal cycling (TC) and damp heat tests (DH) were performed on mini modules with variations in material combinations: low temperature silver and copper pastes, each of them demanding dedicated soldering process parameters and two different encapsulation materials: polyolefin elastomers (POE) and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). All tested modules passed 3 x IEC TC and 2 x IEC DH, while the modules with EVA encapsulant passed DH 3000 as well. The copper paste metallized modules with EVA encapsulant showed no degradation in pseudo fill factor (pFF) and open circuit voltage (VOC), proving the statement that no copper diffuses into the silicon bulk.

Abstract: Diapause is a widespread adaptation of insects that enables them to survive during unfavorable seasons and is characterized by suppressed metabolism and increased lifespan. Previous works have demonstrated that high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in the pupal brain of the moth Helicoverpa armigera induce diapause and extend lifespan by downregulating mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). However, the molecular mechanisms of ROS-HIF-1α regulating metabolic activity to extend lifespan are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the mitochondrial abundance in diapause-type pupal brains is markedly lower than that in their nondiapause-type pupae, suggesting that ROS-HIF-1α signaling negatively regulates the number of mitochondria. The protease Lon, a major mitochondrial matrix protease, can respond to ROS signals. It is activated by transcription factor HIF-1α, which specifically binds the LON promoter to promote its expression. A high level of LON mediates the degradation of TFAM, which is a crucial factor in regulating mitochondrial abundance and metabolic activity. We believe this is the first report that a previously unrecognized regulatory pathway, ROS-HIF-1α-LON-TFAM, reduces mitochondrial activity to induce diapause, extending insect lifespan.

Abstract: AP2 forms AP2 CCV with clathrin and over 60 additional coat proteins. Due to this complexity, we have a limited understanding of CCV life cycle regulation. Synapses contain canonical AP2 CCV, canCCV, and more stable, thereby longer lived, AP2 CCV. The more stable AP2 CCV can be distinguished from canCCV due to the stable binding of Hsc70 to clathrin. The AP1/σ1B complex knockout leads to impaired synaptic vesicle recycling and altered endosomal protein sorting. This causes as a secondary phenotype the twofold upregulation of endocytosis by canCCV and by more stable AP2 CCV. These stable CCV are more stabilized than their wt counterpart, hence stCCV. They have less of the uncoating proteins synaptojanin1 and Hsc70, and more of the coat stabilizing AAK1. Hsc70 clathrin dissociation activity is regulated by complex phosphorylation patterns. Two major groups of hyper- and of hypo-phosphorylated Hsc70 proteins are formed. The latter are enriched in wt stable CCV and stabilized stCCV. Hsc70 T265 phosphorylation regulates binding of CaM/Ca2+. CaM/Ca2+ binding to the T265 domain blocks Hsc70 homodimerization and its concentration in stCCV required for clathrin disassembly. Kinases DYRK1A and CaMK-IIδ can phosphorylate T265 preventing CaM/Ca2+ binding. Their and the levels of STK38L and STK39/Cab39, which are able to phosphorylate additional Hsc70 residues are reduced in stCCV. The stCCV pathway sorts specifically the cell adhesion proteins CHL1 and Neurocan, supporting our model of that the stCCV pathway fulfills specific functions in synaptic plasticity.

Abstract: Cell fate is tightly controlled by a continuous balance between cell survival and cell death inducing mechanisms. B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-family members, composed of effectors and regulators, not only control apoptosis at the level of the mitochondria but also by impacting the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and dynamics. On the one hand, anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, prevents mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) by scaffolding and neutralizing proapoptotic Bcl-2-family members via its hydrophobic cleft (region composed of BH-domain 1–3). On the other hand, Bcl-2 suppress pro-apoptotic Ca2+ signals by binding and inhibiting IP3 receptors via its BH4 domain, which is structurally exiled from the hydrophobic cleft by a flexible loop region (FLR). As such, Bcl-2 prevents excessive Ca2+ transfer from ER to mitochondria. Whereas regulation of both pathways requires different functional regions of Bcl-2, both seem to be connected in cancers that overexpress Bcl-2 in a life-promoting dependent manner. Here we discuss the anti-apoptotic canonical and non-canonical role, via calcium signaling, of Bcl-2 in health and cancer and evolving from this the proposed anti-cancer therapies with their shortcomings. We also argue how some cancers, with the major focus on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are difficult to treat, although theoretically prime marked for Bcl-2-targeting therapeutics. Further work is needed to understand the non-canonical functions of Bcl-2 also at organelles beyond the mitochondria, the interaction partners outside the Bcl-2 family as well as their ability to target or exploit these functions as therapeutic strategies in diseases.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of death in males. It has been reported that δ-catenin expression is upregulated during the late stage of prostate cancer. Palmitoylation promotes protein transport to the cytomembrane and regulates protein localization and function. However, the effect of δ-catenin palmitoylation on the regulation of cancer remains unknown. In this study, we utilized prostate cancer cells overexpressing mutant δ-catenin (J6A cells) to induce a depalmitoylation phenotype and investigate its effect on prostate cancer. Our results indicated that depalmitoylation of δ-catenin not only reduced its membrane expression but also promoted its degradation in the cytoplasm, resulting in a decrease in the effect of EGFR and E-cadherin signaling. Consequently, depalmitoylation of δ-catenin reduced the proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer cells. Our findings provide novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies for controlling the progression of prostate cancer through palmitoylation-based targeting of δ-catenin.

Abstract: Psoriasis is a common and immune-mediated skin disease related to keratinocytes hyperproliferation and inflammation. Fos-like antigen-1 (FOSL1) is an important transcription factor involved in various diseases. FOSL1 has been reported to be differentially expressed in psoriasis. However, the roles and mechanism of FOSL1 in psoriasis progression remain largely unknown. FOSL1 is an upregulated transcription factor in psoriasis and increased in M5-treated HaCaT cells. FOSL1 had a diagnostic value in psoriasis, and positively associated with PASI score, TNF-α and IL-6 levels in psoriasis patients. FOSL1 silencing attenuated M5-induced HaCaT cell hyperproliferation through decreasing cell viability and proliferative ability and increasing cell apoptosis. FOSL1 knockdown mitigated M5-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and it-mediated inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-8 and CCL17) expression. TRAF3 expression was increased in psoriasis patients and M5-treated HaCaT cells. FOSL1 transcriptionally activating TRAF3 in HaCaT cells. TRAF3 overexpression reversed the suppressive effects of FOSL1 silencing on M5-induced hyperproliferation and NLRP3-mediated inflammation. FOSL1 knockdown attenuated M5-induced NF-κB signaling activation by reducing TRAF3. Activation of NF-κB signaling reversed the effects of FOSL1 knockdown on hyperproliferation and inflammation in M5-treated cells. FOSL1 silencing prevented M5-induced hyperproliferation and NLRP3-mediated inflammation of keratinocytes by inhibiting TRAF3-mediated NF-κB activity, indicating FOSL1 might act as a therapeutic target of psoriasis.

Abstract: The crosstalk between lung cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) is pivotal in cancer progression. Heat shock protein family D member 1 (HSPD1) is a potential prognostic biomarker associated with the tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, the role of HSPD1 in CAF activation remains unclear. This study established stable HSPD1-knockdown A549 lung cancer cells using a lentivirus-mediated shRNA transduction. A targeted label-free proteomic analysis identified six significantly altered secretory proteins in the shHSPD1-A549 secretome compared to shControl-A549. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted their involvement in cell-to-cell communication and immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, most altered proteins exhibited positive correlations and significant prognostic impacts on LUAD patient survival. Investigations on the effects of lung cancer secretomes on lung fibroblast WI-38 cells revealed that the shControl-A549 secretome stimulated fibroblast proliferation, migration, and CAF marker expression. These effects were reversed upon the knockdown of HSPD1 in A549 cells. Altogether, our findings illustrate the role of HSPD1 in mediating CAF induction through secretory proteins, potentially contributing to the progression and aggressiveness of lung cancer.

Abstract: Dormancy is a potential way for tumors to develop drug resistance and escape treatment. However, the mechanisms involved in cancer dormancy remain poorly understood. This is mainly because there is no in vitro culture model making it possible to spontaneously induce dormancy. In this context, the present work proposes the use of three-dimensional (3D) spheroids developed from osteosarcoma cell lines as a relevant model for studying cancer dormancy. MNNG-HOS, SaOS-2, 143B, MG-63, U2OS and SJSA-1 cell lines were cultured in 3D using the Liquid Overlay Technique (LOT). Dormancy was studied by staining cancer cells with a lipophilic dye (DiD), and long-term DiD+ cells were considered as dormant cancer cells. The role of the extracellular matrix in inducing dormancy was investigated by embedding cells into methylcellulose or Geltrex™. Gene expression of DiD+ cells was assessed with a Nanostring™ approach and the role of the genes detected in dormancy was validated by a transient down-expression model using siRNA treatment. Proliferation was measured using fluorescence microscopy and the xCELLigence technology. We observed that MNNG-HOS, 143B and MG-G3 cell lines had a reduced proliferation rate in 3D compared to 2D. U2OS cells had an increased proliferation rate when they were cultured in Geltrex™ compared to other 3D culture methods. Using 3D cultures, a transcriptomic signature of dormancy was obtained and showed a decreased expression of 18 genes including ETV4, HELLS, ITGA6, MCM4, PRKDC, RAD21 and UBE2T. The treatment with siRNA targeting these genes showed that cancer cell proliferation was reduced when the expression of ETV4 and MCM4 were decreased, whereas proliferation was increased when the expression of RAD21 was decreased. 3D culture facilitates the maintenance of dormant cancer cells characterized by a reduced proliferation and less differential gene expression as compared to proliferative cells. Further studies of the genes involved has enabled us to envisage their role in regulating cell proliferation.

Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy (DN), one of the most common complications of Diabetes Mellitus, is the leading cause of end-stage renal diseases worldwide. Our previous study proved that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) alleviated renal damages in mice with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus by suppressing overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in podocytes, while the further mechanism of how HGF lessens ROS production had not been clarified yet. ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), the member of the small GTPases superfamilies, is widely spread among epithelial cells and can be activated by the HGF/c-Met signaling. Thus, this study was aimed to explore whether HGF could function on mitochondrial homeostasis, the main resource of ROS, in podocytes exposed to diabetic conditions via ARF6 activation. Our in vivo data showed that HGF markedly ameliorated the pathological damages in kidneys of db/db mice, especially the sharp decline of podocyte number, which was mostly blocked by the ARF6 inhibitor SecinH3. Correspondingly, our in vitro data revealed that HGF protected against high glucose-induced podocyte injuries by increasing ARF6 activity. Besides, this ARF6-dependent beneficial effect of HGF on podocytes was accompanied by improved mitochondrial dynamics and declined DRP1 translocation from cytosol to mitochondria. Collectively, our findings confirm the ability of HGF maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in diabetic podocytes via decreasing ARF6-dependent DRP1 translocation and shed light on the novel mechanism of HGF treatment for DN.

Abstract: Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells are renowned for their high efficiency. However, SHJ solar cells are susceptible to various contaminants, leading to significant performance degradation when exposed to damp-heat conditions (e.g., 85 °C and 85% relative humidity). Sodium (Na) has been identified as one of the main contributors to degradation in silicon solar modules subjected to damp-heat conditions. This work investigates the role of an ultra-thin AlOx capping layer (∼10 nm) in preventing the failure in SHJ cells caused by Na-related contaminants. NaCl is applied directly to the solar cell, and the unencapsulated cell undergoes a damp heat test at 85 °C and 85% relative humidity (DH85). It is found that without the AlOx barrier layer, the SHJ cells experience a relative reduction in power of ∼30%rel after only 20 h at DH85. Both the front and rear sides of the cell degrade when exposed to NaCl. This is primarily due to a deterioration of the Ag contact resulting in increased series resistance (Rs), and decrease in fill factor (FF), and an increase in recombination, leading to a significant drop in open-circuit voltage (Voc), particularly when NaCl is applied on the rear side. However, when an AlOx barrier layer is applied to the SHJ cells, the performance losses caused by NaCl are significantly reduced to only ∼3.3%rel. The loss in Voc on the rear side is completely suppressed, and there is only a slight increase in Rs of ∼50%rel compared to ∼300%rel increase in Rs for cells without the AlOx barrier layer. These findings indicate that the ultra-thin AlOx barrier layer provides effective protection for SHJ cells against Na ions, mitigating both Rs and recombination losses. This AlOx barrier layer depositing method is compatible with existing industrial mass-production ALD tools and thus presents a viable solution at the cell level for SHJ cells.

Abstract: Inhibition of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) is one of the strategies that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) employs as its defence mechanism. In this study, the role of PPE15 (Rv1039c), a late-stage protein, has been investigated in modulating the cellular ROS. We discovered PPE15 to be a secretory protein that downregulates ROS generation in THP1 macrophages. Our in-silico analysis revealed the presence of a eukaryote-like SH3 (SH3e) domain in PPE15. The predicted SH3e-domain of PPE15 was found to interact with cytosolic components of NADPH Oxidase (NOX), p67phox and p47phox through molecular docking. In-vitro experiments using THP1 macrophages showed a diminished NADP/NADPH ratio, indicating reduced NOX activity. We also observed increased levels of p67phox and p47phox in the cytoplasmic fraction of PPE15 treated macrophages as compared to the plasma membrane fraction. To understand the role of the SH3e-domain in ROS modulation, this domain was deleted from the full-length PPE15 (PPE15-/-SH3). We observed an increase in cellular ROS and NADP/NADPH ratio in response to PPE15-/-SH3 protein. The interaction of PPE15-/-SH3 with p67phox or p47phox was also reduced in the cytoplasm, indicating migration of NOX subunits to the plasma membrane. Additionally, M. smegmatis expressing PPE15 was observed to be resistant to oxidative stress with significant intracellular survival in THP1 macrophages as compared to M. smegmatis expressing PPE15-/-SH3. These observations suggest that the SH3e-domain of PPE15 interferes with ROS generation by sequestering NOX components that inhibit NOX assembly at the cell membrane. Therefore, PPE15 acts like a molecular mimic of SH3-domain carrying eukaryotic proteins that can be employed by Mtb at late stages of infection for its survival. These findings give us new insights about the pathogen evading strategy of Mtb which may help in improving the therapeutics for TB treatment.

Abstract: We developed a comprehensive Poisson and drift-diffusion solver coupled with a time-dependent ion migration model in the COMSOL simulation software to analyze hysteresis effects and efficiency in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Initial simulations on PSCs with the structure ITO/SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au revealed suboptimal efficiency of 10.31% due to hysteresis loops near the open-circuit voltage (Voc) caused by interface recombination. Next, we explored the influence of the transport layer's dielectric constant on PSCs performance and hysteresis. The modeling results emphasized the vital role of the transport layer's dielectric constant in determining PSCs hysteresis and power conversion efficiency (PCE). To investigate further, we replaced the hole transport layer (HTL) material with NiO, CuSCN, and CuI. Studied four different transport layer combinations for n-i-p PSCs: SnO2-Spiro-OMeTAD, SnO2–NiO, SnO2–CuSCN, and SnO2–CuI. Notably, the SnO2–CuSCN combination achieved an impressive efficiency of 21.30%. The p-i-n PSCs with a matched dielectric constant PCBM-PTAA transport layer combination achieves higher PCE. It attains a reverse-scan PCE of up to 21.22% with a fill factor (FF) of 85.04%. Our findings underscore the importance of dielectric constant matching in both electron transport layer (ETL) and HTL, highlighting the potential of SnO2–CuSCN and PCBM-PTAA as transport layer materials for achieving high efficiency and minimizing hysteresis in PSCs.

Abstract: The migratory and invasive potential of tumour cells relies on the actin cytoskeleton. We previously demonstrated that the tricyclic compound, TBE-31, inhibits actin polymerization and here we further examine the precise interaction between TBE-31 and actin. We demonstrate that iodoacetamide, a cysteine (Cys) alkylating agent, interferes with the ability of TBE-31 to interact with actin. In addition, in silico analysis identified Cys 217, Cys 272, Cys 285 and Cys 374 as potential binding sites for TBE-31. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we determined that TBE-31 associates with actin with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. We mutated the identified cysteines of actin to alanine and performed a pull-down analysis with a biotin labeled TBE-31 and demonstrated that by mutating Cys 374 to alanine the association between TBE-31 and actin was significantly reduced, suggesting that TBE-31 binds to Cys 374. A characterization of the NIH3T3 cells overexpressing eGFP-actin-C374A showed reduced stress fiber formation, suggesting Cys 374 is necessary for efficient incorporation into filamentous actin. Furthermore, migration of eGFP-Actin-WT expressing cells were observed to be inhibited by TBE-31, however fewer eGFP-Actin-C374A expressing cells were observed to migrate compared to the cells expressing eGFP-Actin-WT in the presence or absence of TBE-31. Taken together, our results suggest that TBE-31 binds to Cys 374 of actin to inhibit actin stress fiber formation and may potentially be a mechanism through which TBE-31 inhibits cell migration.

Abstract: Background
Understanding the genetic underpinnings of protein networks conferring stemness is of broad interest for basic and translational research.
Methods
We used multi-omics analyses to identify and characterize stemness genes, and focused on the zinc finger protein 982 (Zfp982) that regulates stemness through the expression of Nanog, Zfp42, and Dppa3 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC).
Results
Zfp982 was expressed in stem cells, and bound to chromatin through a GCAGAGKC motif, for example near the stemness genes Nanog, Zfp42, and Dppa3. Nanog and Zfp42 were direct targets of ZFP982 that decreased in expression upon knockdown and increased upon overexpression of Zfp982. We show that ZFP982 expression strongly correlated with stem cell characteristics, both on the transcriptional and morphological levels. Zfp982 expression decreased with progressive differentiation into ecto-, endo- and mesodermal cell lineages, and knockdown of Zfp982 correlated with morphological and transcriptional features of differentiated cells. Zfp982 showed transcriptional overlap with members of the Hippo signaling pathway, one of which was Yap1, the major co-activator of Hippo signaling. Despite the observation that ZFP982 and YAP1 interacted and localized predominantly to the cytoplasm upon differentiation, the localization of YAP1 was not influenced by ZFP982 localization.
Conclusions
Together, our study identified ZFP982 as a transcriptional regulator of early stemness genes, and since ZFP982 is under the control of the Hippo pathway, underscored the importance of the context-dependent Hippo signals for stem cell characteristics.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-released vesicles that mediate intercellular communication by transferring bioactive cargo. Protein and RNA sorting into EVs has been extensively assessed, while selective enrichment of glycans in EVs remains less explored. In this study, a mass spectrometry-based approach, glycan node analysis (GNA), was applied to broadly assess the sorting of glycan features into EVs. Two metastatic variants (lung and bone) generated in mouse modes from the MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line were assessed, as these EVs are known to contain distinct organotropic biomolecules. EVs were isolated from conditioned cell culture medium by tangential flow filtration and authenticated by standard techniques. GNA analysis revealed selective enrichment of several glycan features in EVs compared to the originating cells, particularly those associated with binding to the extracellular matrix, which was also observed in EVs from the parental MDA-MB-231 cell line (human pleural metastases). The bone-tropic variant displayed enrichment of distinct EV glycan features compared to the lung-tropic one. Additionally, the metastatic variants generated in mouse models displayed reduced EV glycan sorting compared to the parental metastatic cell line. This study represents the first comprehensive assessment of differences in glycan features between EVs and originating cells and provides evidence that the diversity of EV glycan sorting is reduced upon generation of variant cell lines in mouse models. Future research is likely to uncover novel mechanisms of EV glycan sorting, shed light on glycan features for EV authentication or biomarker purposes, and assess functional roles of the EV glycocode in (patho)physiology.

Abstract: Exploring the molecular mechanisms of cell behaviors is beneficial for promoting periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSC)-mediated tissue regeneration. This study intends to explore the regulatory effects of EID3 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and osteogenic differentiation and to preliminarily explore the regulatory mechanism of EID3. Here, EID3 was overexpressed or knocked down in PDLSCs by recombinant lentivirus. Then, cell proliferation activity was analyzed by colony-forming assay, EdU assay, and cell cycle assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The osteo-differentiation potential was analyzed using ALP activity assay, ALP staining, alizarin red staining, and mRNA and protein assay of osteo-differentiation related genes. The results showed that when EID3 was knocked down, the proliferation activity and osteogenic differentiation potential of PDLSCs decreased, while they increased when EID3 was overexpressed. The cell apoptosis rate decreased in PDLSCs with EID3 knockdown but increased in PDLSCs with EID3 overexpression. Moreover, EID3 inhibited the transduction of the AKT/MTOR and ERK signaling pathway. In addition, TAZ negatively regulated the expression of EID3, and the overexpression of EID3 partially reversed the promotive effects of TAZ on the osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs. Taken together, EID3 inhibits the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation while promoting the apoptosis of PDLSCs. EID3 inhibits the transduction of the AKT/MTOR and ERK signaling pathways and mediates the regulatory effect of TAZ on PDLSC osteogenic differentiation.

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a devastating pathology of numerous ocular diseases, such as wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), which causes irreversible vision loss. Although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has been widely used, poor response or no response still exists in some cases, suggesting that there are other components involved in the angiogenic process. Therefore, the underlying mechanism needs to be clarified and new target of anti-angiogenic therapy is urgently needed. It has been demonstrated that damaged retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells can activate inflammasome, driving a degenerative tissue environment and an enhanced pro-angiogenic response, which implies that RPE dysfunction may be a hallmark of the pathogenesis. Previously, we have shown that DNA damage can induce RPE dysfunction, triggering senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and local inflammation. In this study, we identify that chrysin can reduce DNA damage, especially telomere erosion in vitro, thus compromise the dysfunction of RPE and the decreased expression of SASP factor. Importantly, we find that DNA damage of RPE cells is remarkable in laser-induced CNV lesion, resulting in inflammatory response, which can be ameliorated by chrysin, mainly through IL-17 signaling pathway and its downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activities. In summary, our results indicate the interplay between DNA damage, perturbed RPE homeostasis, inflammatory response and angiogenesis in laser-induced CNV, and more importantly, chrysin may be an effective therapeutic supplement for CNV.

Abstract: Calcium signalling is involved in many processes in mammalian retina, from development to mature functions and neurodegeneration. Although proteins involved in Ca2+ entry in retinal cells have been well studied, less is known about Ca2+-clearance. Among the Ca2+ pumps, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs) have been identified as key proteins extruding Ca2+ across the plasma membrane with specific distribution in developing and adult retina. However, the two main isoforms of intracellular Ca2+-ATPases in the central nervous system, the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) and the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase 1 (SPCA1), which remove cytosolic Ca2+ into intracellular stores, have been less or not at all analysed, respectively. In this study, we described for the first time the SPCA1 localisation in adult mouse retina and we report differential distributions of SERCA2b and SPCA1 transporters within various classes of retinal neurons and distinct subcellular localisations. In addition, we studied the expression and localisation of both Ca2+ pumps in 661W cells, a cone photoreceptor-derived cell line. Since continuous exposure to high light intensity induces photodegeneration, we analysed the effect of LED light exposure on these cells and SERCA2b and SPCA1 distribution. We found that continuous mild LED-light exposure compromised cell survival and produced stress in the ER and Golgi, the Ca2+ stores where the two pumps are localised. These effects were reversed after halting light exposure and washing. This study demonstrates that Ca2+ signalling may be involved in light-induced photoreceptor cell damage and points to previously unrecognised functions of intracellular Ca2+-ATPases in retina physiology.

Abstract: Endogenous electric fields (EFs) have been demonstrated to facilitate wound healing by directing the migration of epidermal cells. Despite the identification of numerous molecules and signaling pathways that are crucial for the directional migration of keratinocytes under EFs, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain undefined. Previous studies have indicated that microtubule (MT) acetylation is linked to cell migration, while Paxillin exerts a significant influence on cell motility. Therefore, we postulated that Paxillin could enhance EF-induced directional migration of keratinocytes by modulating MT acetylation. In the present study, we observed that EFs (200 mV/mm) induced migration of human immortalized epidermal cells (HaCaT) towards the anode, while upregulating Paxillin, downregulating HDAC6, and increasing the level of microtubule acetylation. Our findings suggested that Paxillin plays a pivotal role in inhibiting HDAC6-mediated microtubule acetylation during directional migration under EF regulation. Conversely, downregulation of Paxillin decreased microtubule acetylation and electrotaxis of epidermal cells by promoting HDAC6 expression, and this effect could be reversed by the addition of tubacin, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor. Furthermore, we observed that EFs also mediated the polarization of Paxillin and acetylated α-tubulin, which is critical for directional migration. In conclusion, our study revealed that MT acetylation in EF-guided keratinocyte migration is regulated by the Paxillin/HDAC6 signaling pathway, providing a novel theoretical foundation for the molecular mechanism of EF-guided directional migration of keratinocytes.

DDIT3/CHOP promotes LPS/ATP-induced pyroptosis in osteoblasts via mitophagy inhibition,

Abstract: Inflammatory environments can trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and lead to pyroptosis in various tissues and cells, including liver, brain, and immune cells. As a key factor of ER stress, DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3)/CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) is upregulated in osteoblasts during inflammatory stimulation. DDIT3/CHOP may therefore regulate osteoblast pyroptosis in inflammatory conditions. During this investigation, we found that lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) stimulation in vitro induced osteoblasts to undergo pyroptosis, and the expression of DDIT3/CHOP was increased during this process. The overexpression of DDIT3/CHOP further promoted osteoblast pyroptosis as evidenced by the increased expression of the inflammasome NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and ratios of caspase-1 p20/caspase-1 and cleaved gasdermin D (GSDMD)/GSDMD. To explore the specific mechanism of this effect, we found through fluorescence imaging and Western blot analysis that LPS/ATP stimulation promoted PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase parkin (Parkin)-mediated mitophagy in osteoblasts, and this alteration was suppressed by the DDIT3/CHOP overexpression, resulting in increased ratio of pyroptosis compared with the control groups. The impact of DDIT3/CHOP on pyroptosis in osteoblasts was reversed by the application of carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a specific mitophagy agonist. Therefore, our data demonstrated that DDIT3/CHOP promotes osteoblast pyroptosis by inhibiting PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in an inflammatory environment.

Abstract: γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The termination of GABA transmission is through the action of GABA transporters (GATs). mGAT4 (encoded by Slc6a11) is another GAT besides GAT1 (encoded by Slc6a1) that functions in GABA reuptake in CNS. Research on the function of mGAT4 is still in its infancy. We developed an mGat4 knockout mouse model (mGat4−/− mice) and performed a series of behavioral analyses for the first time to study the effect of mGat4 on biological processes in CNS. Our results indicated that homozygous mGat4−/− mice had less depression, anxiety-like behavior and more social activities than their wild-type littermate controls. However, they had weight loss and showed motor incoordination and imbalance. Meanwhile, mGat4−/− mice showed increased pain threshold and hypoalgesia behavior in nociceptive stimulus and learning and memory impairments. The expression of multiple components of the GABAergic system including GAD67, GABAA and KCC2 was altered. There is little or no compensatory change in mGat1. In a word, mGat4 may play a key role in normal motor coordination, sensation, emotion, learning and memory and could be the potential target of neurological disorders.

Abstract: This study reports on the influence of air annealing and Na incorporation into the absorber on the performance of Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) bifacial solar cells with FTO and W/FTO back contacts. Na was incorporated by depositing ∼12 nm thick NaF on the CZTS precursors prior to the sulfurization process via thermal evaporation. After sulfurization, some of the samples were annealed in air at 300 °C for 90 s and subsequently at 200 °C for 600 s. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed sulfurization of the W interlayer to form WS2 which improves the FTO ohmicity. Na incorporation improved grain size of the absorber as revealed by scanning electron microscopy. Non-annealed samples had the unwanted SnS2 phase while the air annealed samples, particularly those with both W interlayer and Na incorporation, were exempt from SnS2 phase, as was confirmed through grazing incident X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. These results suggest that absorber air annealing and Na incorporation enhance absorber crystal growth which is advantageous in reducing bulk carrier recombination. As a result, the efficiency was significantly improved from 3.0% for solar cells fabricated directly on FTO to 5.2% for those whose absorbers were air annealed, incorporated with Na and made on W/FTO. The latter also exhibits the highest external quantum efficiency response and calculated short circuit current density for both sides illumination. This indicates that the air annealing, Na incorporation and W interlayer are enhancing the performance of bifacial CZTS solar cells with FTO back contact for both back side and front side illumination.

Abstract: The genome is frequently targeted by genotoxic agents, resulting in the formation of DNA scars. However, cells employ diverse repair mechanisms to restore DNA integrity. Among these processes, the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex detects double-strand breaks (DSBs) and recruits DNA damage response proteins such as ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase to DNA damage sites. ATM phosphorylates the transactivation domain (TAD) of the p53 tumor suppressor, which in turn regulates DNA repair, growth arrest, apoptosis, and senescence following DNA damage. The disordered glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) domain of double-strand break protein MRE11 (MRE11GAR) and its methylation are important for DSB repair, and localization to Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). There is preliminary evidence that p53, PML protein, and MRE11 might co-localize and interact at DSB sites. To uncover the molecular details of these interactions, we aimed to identify the domains mediating the p53-MRE11 interaction and to elucidate the regulation of the p53-MRE11 interaction by post-translational modifications (PTMs) through a combination of biophysical techniques. We discovered that, in vitro, p53 binds directly to MRE11GAR mainly through p53TAD2 and that phosphorylation further enhances this interaction. Furthermore, we found that MRE11GAR methylation still allows for binding to p53. Overall, we demonstrated that p53 and MRE11 interaction is facilitated by disordered regions. We provide for the first time insight into the molecular details of the p53-MRE11 complex formation and elucidate potential regulatory mechanisms that will promote our understanding of the DNA damage response. Our findings suggest that PTMs regulate the p53-MRE11 interaction and subsequently their colocalization to PML-NBs upon DNA damage.

Abstract: Recent findings suggest that uncarboxylated osteocalcin (GluOC) promotes glucose and lipid metabolism via its putative receptor GPRC6A; however, its direct effect on adipocytes remains elusive. In this study, we elucidated the effects of GluOC on adipocytes, with an emphasis on the role of cell adhesion molecules. We determined that GluOC promoted the expression of adipocyte adhesion molecule (ACAM) and its transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 4 and enhanced the cortical actin filament assembly, which ameliorated lipid droplet hypertrophy. Additionally, GluOC upregulated the expression of integrin αVβ3 and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and prevented insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) degradation by inhibiting the ubiquitin–proteasome system via the FAK–PLC–PKC axis, which activated IRS1–Akt-mediated glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) transport. Furthermore, we showed that GluOC elevated the expression of the insulin-independent glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT8, which facilitated insulin stimulation-independent glucose transport. The GluOC-induced activation of integrin αVβ3 signaling promoted microtubule assembly, which improved glucose and lipid metabolism via its involvement in intracellular vesicular transport. GluOC treatment also suppressed collagen type 1 formation, which might prevent adipose tissue fibrosis in obese individuals. Overall, our results imply that GluOC promotes glucose and lipid metabolism via ACAM, integrin αVβ3, and GLUT1 and 8 expression, directly affecting adipocytes.

Abstract: Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) bacteria improve the functions of theere intestinal and blood–brain barriers (BBB) via their extracellular vesicles (AmEvs). However, their role in postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate, we used C57BL/6 J mice divided into five groups: Sham, POCD, POCD+Akk, POCD+Evs, and POCD+Evs + PLX5622. POCD was induced through intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). The mice's cognitive function was assessed using behavioral tests, and possible mechanisms were explored by examining gut and BBB permeability, inflammation, and microglial function. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2/4 pathway-related proteins were also investigated both in vitro and in vivo. PLX5622 chow was employed to eliminate microglial cells. Our findings revealed a negative correlation between AKK abundance and POCD symptoms. Supplementation with either AKK or AmEvs improved cognitive function, improved the performance of the intestinal barrier and BBB, and decreased inflammation and microglial activation in POCD mice compared to controls. Moreover, AmEvs treatment inhibited TLR2/4 signaling in the brains of POCD mice and LPS-treated microglial cells. In microglial-ablated POCD mice, however, AmEvs failed to protect BBB integrity. Overall, AmEvs is a potential therapeutic strategy for managing POCD by enhancing gut and BBB integrity and inhibiting microglial-mediated TLR2/4 signaling.

Abstract: The best-known function of the essential GPN-loop GTPase Gpn3 is to contribute to RNA polymerase II assembly, a prerequisite for its nuclear targeting. Although this process occurs in the cytoplasm, we have previously shown that Gpn3 enters the cell nucleus before being polyubiquitinated. Here, we show that inhibiting Crm1-mediated nuclear export with leptomycin B, or the proteasome with MG132, caused the nuclear accumulation of recombinant and endogenous Gpn3 in MCF-12A cells. When added simultaneously, leptomycin B and MG132 had an additive effect. Analysis of Gpn3 primary sequence revealed the presence of at least five nuclear export sequence (NES) motifs, with some having a higher exposure to the solvent in the GTP-bound than GDP-bound state in a Gpn3 structural model. Inactivation of any of these NESes led to some degree of Gpn3 nuclear accumulation, although mutating NES1 or NES3 had the more robust effect. MCF-12A cells expressing exclusively a NES-deficient version of Gpn3R-Flag proliferated slower than cells expressing Gpn3R-Flag wt, indicating that nuclear export is important for Gpn3 function. Next, we searched for physiological conditions regulating Gpn3 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Interestingly, whereas Gpn3R-Flag was both nuclear and cytoplasmic in low-density growing MCF-12A cells, it was exclusively cytoplasmic in high-density areas. Furthermore, Gpn3R-Flag was cytoplasmic, mostly perinuclear, in sparse but starved MCF-12A cells, and serum-stimulation caused a rapid, although transient, Gpn3R-Flag nuclear accumulation. We conclude that Gpn3 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is regulated by cell density and growth factors, and propose that Gpn3 has an unknown nuclear function positively linked to cell growth and/or proliferation.

Abstract: Chemically activated biochar with richer pore structure and higher specific surface area is well suited for loading phase change materials (PCMs). However, the effect of structural characteristics and abundant surface functional groups of chemically activated biochar on the thermal properties of PCMs has not been systematically investigated. Here, shape-stable samples were prepared by introducing biochar obtained by activation with different chemical reagents (ZnCl2, H3PO4, KOH, and K2CO3) into three organic PCMs (paraffin, stearic acid, and polyethylene glycol). The results indicated that the biochar activated by KOH possessed the highest specific surface area of 1344.45 m2/g, followed by biochar activated by ZnCl2, H3PO4, and K2CO3 of 1297.35, 1062.74, and 891.38 m2/g, respectively. The loading capacity of KOH-activated biochar was as high as 82.12 %, 83.13 %, and 80.81 % for the three organic PCMs, and the melting enthalpies of corresponding composite PCMs were 163.82, 168.54, and 139.96 kJ/kg. Additionally, the influence degree on the enthalpies of the three PCMs was only 10.84 %, 12.26 %, and 7.74 %, while that of ZnCl2 and H3PO4-activated biochar was as high as 53.61 % and 44.22 %, 52.10 %, and 57.74 %, 55.35 % and 45.79 % indicating the two biochar were not suitable as support materials for PCMs. Moreover, ZnCl2-activated biochar has the most apparent upgradation on PCMs' thermal conductivity, which could increase the thermal conductivity of the three organic PCMs by 1.318, 1.34, and 1.229 times, respectively, followed by H3PO4, K2CO3, and KOH-activated biochar.

Abstract: Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) has been recently demonstrated as a potential diagnostic biomarker for thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). However, its precise role in the progression of TAA remains unclear. In this study, TAA models were established in ApoE-knockout mice and primary mouse vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through treatment with angiotensin (Ang) II. Our findings revealed a downregulation of ESR1 in Ang II-induced TAA mice and VSMCs. Upregulation of ESR1 mitigated expansion and cell apoptosis in the mouse aorta, reduced pathogenetic transformation of VSMCs, and reduced inflammatory infiltration and oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we identified macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as a biological target of ESR1. ESR1 bound to the MIF promoter to suppress its transcription. Artificial MIF restoration negated the mitigating effects of ESR1 on TAA. Additionally, we discovered that murine double minute 2 (MDM2) was highly expressed in TAA models and mediated protein degradation of ESR1 through ubiquitination modification. Silencing of MDM2 reduced VSMC dedifferentiation and suppressed oxidative stress. However, these effects were reversed upon further silencing of ESR1. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MDM2 activates MIF by mediating ESR1 degradation, thus promoting VSMC dedifferentiation and oxidative stress during TAA progression.

Abstract: Talin protein (Talin 1/2) is a mechanosensitive cytoskeleton protein. The unique structure of the Talin plays a vital role in transmitting mechanical forces. Talin proteins connect the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton by linking to integrins and actin, thereby mediating the conversion of mechanical signals into biochemical signals and influencing disease progression as potential diagnostic indicators, therapeutic targets, and prognostic indicators of various diseases. Most studies in recent years have confirmed that mechanical forces also have a crucial role in the development of disease, and Talin has been found to play a role in several diseases. Still, more studies need to be done on how Talin is involved in mechanical signaling in disease. This review focuses on the mechanical signaling of Talin in disease, aiming to summarize the mechanisms by which Talin plays a role in disease and to provide references for further studies.

Abstract: The inflammatory response is a key process in periodontitis. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has been proven to be involved in various physiological and pathological processes. This study aims to investigate the role and downstream mechanism of N6-adenosine-enzyme subunits methyltransferase (METTL) 3 and 14 in the inflammatory response of periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs). The total m6A content and the expression of METTL3 and METTL14 were upregulated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated PDLCs. Knockdown of METTL3 or METTL14 suppressed the LPS-induced interleukin (IL)-6 expression, as shown by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mechanistically, conjoint analysis of m6A sequencing of METTL3-knockdown and METTL14-knockdown PDLCs revealed that the expression of solute carrier family 39 member 9 (SLC39A9) was mediated in a m6A-dependent manner. The suppression of LPS-induced IL-6 by METTL3 or METTL14 knockdown was partially counteracted by SLC39A9 knockdown, which induced downregulation of intracellular zinc via immunofluorescence staining. Amplicon bisulfite sequencing (AmpBS) demonstrated that METTL3/14 knockdown increased the methylation at one position of the IL-6 promoter, while SLC39A9 knockdown decreased it, which was basically consistent with the intracellular zinc concentration and negatively associated with IL-6 expression. Moreover, METTL3 or METTL14 knockdown attenuated the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which was partially counteracted by SLC39A9 knockdown. These results revealed the “LPS-METTL3/14-SLC39A9-zinc-IL-6” axis and involvement of p38 and JNK MAPK signaling pathway in the inflammatory responses of PDLCs.

Abstract: Human DNA polymerase ι (Polι) belongs to the Y-family of specialized DNA polymerases engaged in the DNA damage tolerance pathway of translesion DNA synthesis that is crucial to the maintenance of genome integrity. The extreme infidelity of Polι and the fact that both its up- and down-regulation correlate with various cancers indicate that Polι expression and access to the replication fork should be strictly controlled. Here, we identify RNF2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a new interacting partner of Polι that is responsible for Polι stabilization in vivo. Interestingly, while we report that RNF2 does not directly ubiquitinate Polι, inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF2 affects the cellular level of Polι thereby protecting it from destabilization. Additionally, we indicate that this mechanism is more general, as DNA polymerase η, another Y-family polymerase and the closest paralogue of Polι, share similar features.

Abstract: Tanc1 and its homologous protein Tanc2 are critical synaptic scaffold proteins which regulate synaptic spine densities and excitatory synapse strength. Recent studies indicated TANC1 and TANC2 are candidate genes of several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). In this study, we identified and characterized a novel interaction between Tanc1/2 and Myo18a, mediated by the Tanc1/2 TPR domains and Myo18a coiled-coil domain and C-extension (CCex). Sequence analysis and size exclusion chromatography experiments reveal that high salt disrupts the interaction between Myo18a and Tanc1/2, indicating that the interaction is primarily driven by charge-charge interactions. More importantly, we found that the Tanc1-TPR/Myo18a CCex interaction could undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in both cultured cells and test tubes, which provides the biochemical basis and potential molecular mechanisms for the LLPS-mediated interactions between Myo18a and Tanc1/2.

Abstract: The replication of DNA requires specialized and intricate machinery. This machinery is known as a replisome and is highly evolutionarily conserved, from simple unicellular organisms such as yeast to human cells. The replisome comprises multiple protein complexes responsible for various steps in the replication process. One crucial component of the replisome is the Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase complex, which unwinds double-stranded DNA and coordinates the assembly and function of other replisome components, including DNA polymerases. The genes encoding the CMG helicase components are essential for initiating DNA replication. In this study, we aimed to investigate how the absence of one copy of the CMG complex genes in heterozygous Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells impacts the cells' physiology and aging. Our data revealed that these cells exhibited a significant reduction in transcript levels for the respective CMG helicase complex proteins, as well as disruptions in the cell cycle, extended doubling times, and alterations in their biochemical profile. Notably, this study provided the first demonstration that cells heterozygous for genes encoding subunits of the CMG helicase exhibited a significantly increased reproductive potential and delayed chronological aging. Additionally, we observed a noteworthy correlation between RNA and polysaccharide levels in yeast and their reproductive potential, as well as a correlation between fatty acid levels and cell doubling times. Our findings also shed new light on the potential utility of yeast in investigating potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Imidazole propionate (ImP) is a detrimental metabolite produced by the fermentation of histidine intermediates via the intestinal flora. Here, the untargeted metabolite analysis of plasma metabolites from patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN), in combination with the Human Metabolome Database, revealed significantly increased levels of ImP in patients with DN, with a positive correlation with patients' blood creatinine concentration and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and a negative correlation with the glomerular filtration rate. RNA-seq was applied to detect the effects of ImP on renal tissue transcriptome in mice with DN. It demonstrated that ImP exacerbated renal injury in mice with DN and promoted renal tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to renal mesenchymal fibrosis and renal impairment. Furthermore, ImP was found to directly target HAP90α and activate the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, which is involved in EMT, by the drug affinity response target stability method. The findings showed that ImP may provide a novel target for DN quality, as it can directly bind to and activate HSP90, thereby facilitating the development of DN while acting as a potential indicator for the clinical diagnosis of DN.

Abstract: Ribosomes across species contain subsets of zinc finger proteins that play structural roles by binding to rRNA. While the majority of these zinc fingers belong to the C2-C2 type, the large subunit protein L36 in bacteria and mitochondria exhibits an atypical C2-CH motif. To comprehend the contribution of each coordinating residue in S. cerevisiae bL36m to mitoribosome assembly and function, we engineered and characterized strains carrying single and double mutations in the zinc coordinating residues. Our findings reveal that although all four residues markedly influence protein stability, C to A mutations in C66 and/or C69 have a more pronounced effect compared to those at C82 and H88. Importantly, protein stability directly correlates with the assembly and function of the mitoribosome and the growth rate of yeast in respiratory conditions. Mass spectrometry analysis of large subunit particles indicates that strains deleted for bL36m or expressing mutant variants have defective assembly of the L7/L12 stalk base, limiting their functional competence. Furthermore, we employed a synthetic bL36m protein collection, including both wild-type and mutant proteins, to elucidate their ability to bind zinc. Our data indicate that mutations in C82 and, particularly, H88 allow for some zinc binding albeit inefficient or unstable, explaining the residual accumulation and activity in mitochondria of bL36m variants carrying mutations in these residues. In conclusion, stable zinc binding by bL36m is essential for optimal mitoribosome assembly and function. MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD046465.

Abstract: Crystalline germanium (c-Ge) has historically been regarded as a cost-effective alternative to III-V semiconductors for thermophotovoltaic (TPV) device fabrication. However, Ge-based devices have not yet reported high efficiencies, partially due to the lack of an efficient back-surface reflector that turns back to the heat source out-band (sub-bandgap) thermal radiation. The difficulty of implementing back surface reflectors in Ge TPV cells is related to the simultaneous requirement of good back surface passivation, low electrical resistivity, and high out-band optical reflectivity. In this study, we demonstrate a highly reflective ohmic contact to p-type c-Ge (doping concentration of 2 × 1015 cm−3) made of an aSiCx(1 nm)/Al2O3 (50 nm)/aSiC (45 nm) stack that is laser processed using Nd:YVO4 laser emitting at 355 nm to create punctual p+ contacts (locally diffused Al regions). This stack is finally caped with a thick (1000 nm) Al layer that behaves as a metallic mirror and back electrode. As the laser processed area increases from 0.1 to 3 %, which is the typical range in the final devices, the surface recombination velocity increase from 10.5 to 60.0 cm/s, while the effective contact resistance reduces from 0.462 to 0.036 Ω cm2. Moreover, a sub-bandgap reflectance of 90–98 % is achieved. Simulations assuming ideal device configuration indicate that implementing these back contacts could potentially enable TPV cell conversion efficiencies comparable to the reported high-efficiency c-Ge TPV cells operating at similar illumination temperature.

Abstract: Hypertension is one of the major life-threatening complications of obesity. Recently adipose multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were implicated to the pathogenesis of obesity-associated hypertension. These cells amplify noradrenaline-induced vascular cell contraction via cAMP-mediated signaling pathway. In this study we tested the ability of several cAMP-mediated hormones to affect the adrenergic sensitivity of MSCs and their associated contractility. Despite that adipose MSCs express a plethora of receptors capable of cAMP signaling activation, only 5-HT was able to elevate α1A-adrenoceptor-induced Ca2+ signaling in MSCs. Furthermore, 5-HT markedly enhanced noradrenaline-induced MSCs contractility. Using HTR isoform-specific antagonists followed by CRISPRi-mediated knockdown, we identified that the observed 5-HT effect on MSCs was mediated by the HTR6 isoform. This receptor was previously associated exclusively with 5-HT central nervous system activity. Discovered effect of HTR6 on MSCs contractility points to it as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of obesity-associated hypertension.

Abstract: In prostate cancer (PCa) patients, a proto-oncogene Tumor protein D52 (TPD52) is overexpressed, and it is involved in different cellular functions. In this study, we report that TPD52 expression is positively associated with the emergence of neuroendocrine PCa (NEPC). With overexpression of TPD52 in LNCaP cells, we found neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of cells in in-vitro and distinct NED features confirmed by NE markers neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and chromogranin A (CHR-A). Further, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in TPD52 mediated NED of PCa cells. We found that TPD52 activates the NF- κB – STAT3 axis for the induction of NED in LNCaP cells. Indeed, inhibition of NF-κB – STAT3 attenuated the progression of NED in TPD52 positive LNCaP cells. Importantly, silencing of TPD52 expression or inhibition of NF-κB – STAT3 activity in a neuroendocrine cell line NCI-H660 showed a marked decrease in the expression of NSE and CHR-A, confirming the reversal of the NE properties. Notably, TPD52 overexpression in LNCaP cells induced expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB1, and Snail1 indicating that TPD52 positively regulates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PCa cells towards NED. Moreover, silencing of Snail1 in TPD52 positive cells blocked the progression of NED and, in NCI-H660 cells reversed NE properties as expected. Of the few requirements of TPD52, activation of NF-κB – STAT3 is essential for promoting EMT compelling NED of LNCaP cells. Collectively, these results reveal that TPD52 is associated with the progression of NEPC and emphasizes the need for therapeutic targeting of TPD52 in PCa.

Abstract: Background
The carcinogenic transcription factor c-Myc is the most aggressive oncogene, which drive malignant transformation and dissemination of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Recruitment of many cofactors, especially WDR5, a protein that nucleates H3K4me chromatin modifying complexes, play a pivotal role in regulating c-Myc-dependent gene transcription, a critical process for c-Myc signaling to function in a variety of biological and pathological contexts. For this reason, interrupting the interaction between c-Myc and the transcription cofactor WDR5 may become the most promising new strategy for treating c-Myc driven TNBC.
Methods
Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (IP-MS) is used to screen proteins that bind c-Myc/WDR5 interactions. The interaction of METTL3 with c-Myc/WDR5 in breast cancer tissues and TNBC cells was detected by Co-IP and immunofluorescence. Subsequently, we further analyzed the influence of METTL3 expression on c-Myc/WDR5 protein expression and its interaction stability by Western blot and Co-IP. The correlation between METTL3 and c-Myc pathway was analyzed by ChIP-seq sequencing and METTL3 knockdown transcriptome data. The effect of METTL3 expression on c-Myc transcriptional activity was detected by ChIP-qPCR and Dual Luciferase Reporter. At the same time, the overexpression vector METTL3-MUT (m6A) was constructed, which mutated the methyltransferase active site (Aa395–398, DPPW/APPA), and further explored whether the interaction between METTL3 and c-Myc/WDR5 was independent of methyltransferase activity. In addition, we also detected the changes of METTL3 expression on TNBC's sensitivity to small molecule inhibitors such as JQ1 and OICR9429 by CCK8, Transwell and clonal formation assays. Finally, we further verified our conclusions in spontaneous tumor formation mouse MMTV-PyMT and nude mouse orthotopic transplantation tumor models.
Results
METTL3 was found to bind mainly to c-Myc/WDR5 protein in the nucleus. It enhances the stability of c-Myc/WDR5 interaction through its methyltransferase independent mechanism, thereby enhancing the transcriptional activity of c-Myc on downstream glucose metabolism genes. Notably, the study also confirmed that METTL3 can directly participate in the transcription of glucose metabolism genes as a transcription factor, and knockdown METTL3 enhances the drug sensitivity of breast cancer cells to small molecule inhibitors JQ1 and OICR9429. The study was further confirmed by spontaneous tumor formation mouse MMTV-PyMT and nude mouse orthotopic transplantation tumor models.
Conclusion
METTL3 binds to the c-Myc/WDR5 protein complex and promotes glycolysis, which plays a powerful role in promoting TNBC progression. Our findings further broaden our understanding of the role and mechanism of action of METTL3, and may open up new therapeutic avenues for effective treatment of TNBC with high c-Myc expression.

Abstract: Centromere protein L (CENPL) is involved in the mitotic process of eukaryotic cells and the development of various types of cancer. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the expression and clinical significance of CENPL in HCC, and explore its involvement in regulating HCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and glycolysis both in vivo and in vitro. CENPL expression was analyzed in HCC and normal liver tissues using The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus mining, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. Functional assays were used to assess the role of CENPL in HCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and glycolysis. The potential pathways underlying the regulatory effects of CENPL, as well as the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway-related molecules and markers of proliferation and glycolysis were investigated. CENPL was significantly upregulated in HCC tissue and associated with multiple clinicopathological features and poor patient prognosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that CENPL may serve as an independent prognostic factor for HCC. Upregulation of CENPL in HCC regulated tumor proliferation and glycolytic processes. Mechanistic studies revealed that differentially expressed genes between the CENPL-overexpressing and control groups were mainly concentrated in the MAPK signaling pathway. Pathway inhibition analysis indicated that CENPL activated the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway to promote proliferation and glycolysis in HCC cells. This study elucidated the role of CENPL in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and glycolysis in HCC. CENPL may represent a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for HCC.

Abstract: Background
We tested whether enhancing the capacity for calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) signaling would delay fatigue of excitation-induced calcium release and improve contractile characteristics of skeletal muscle during fatiguing exercise.
Methods
Fast and slow type muscle, gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and soleus (SOL), of rats and mouse interosseus (IO) muscle fibers, were transfected with pcDNA3-based plasmids for rat α and β CaMKII or empty controls. Levels of CaMKII, its T287-phosphorylation (pT287-CaMKII), and phosphorylation of components of calcium release and re-uptake, ryanodine receptor 1 (pS2843-RyR1) and phospholamban (pT17-PLN), were quantified biochemically. Sarcoplasmic calcium in transfected muscle fibers was monitored microscopically during trains of electrical excitation based on Fluo-4 FF fluorescence (n = 5–7). Effects of low- (n = 6) and high- (n = 8) intensity exercise on pT287-CaMKII and contractile characteristics were studied in situ.
Results
Co-transfection with αCaMKII-pcDNA3/βCaMKII-pcDNA3 increased α and βCaMKII levels in SOL (+45.8 %, +250.5 %) and GM (+40.4 %, +89.9 %) muscle fibers compared to control transfection. High-intensity exercise increased pT287-βCaMKII and pS2843-RyR1 levels in SOL (+269 %, +151 %) and GM (+354 %, +119 %), but decreased pT287-αCaMKII and p17-PLN levels in GM compared to SOL (−76 % vs. +166 %; 0 % vs. +128 %). α/β CaMKII overexpression attenuated the decline of calcium release in muscle fibers with repeated excitation, and mitigated exercise-induced deterioration of rates in force production, and passive force, in a muscle-dependent manner, in correlation with pS2843-RyR1 and pT17-PLN levels (|r| > 0.7).
Conclusion
Enhanced capacity for α/β CaMKII signaling improves fatigue-resistance of active and passive contractile muscle properties in association with RyR1- and PLN-related improvements in sarcoplasmic calcium release.

Abstract: This work is concerned with a novel ternary eutectic salt based phase change material (PCM) for high temperature thermal energy storage applications. We designed the PCM formulation in a FactSage environment and demonstrated that the formulation had a very high latent heat. The microstructure, thermal physical properties, thermal stability and cycling service life of the eutectic salt were measured experimentally with various analytical methods including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometer analysis (XRD), simultaneous thermogravimetric analyzer (STA) technique, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results indicated that the eutectic salt had a melting point of 552.23 °C with a superhigh fusion enthalpy of 661.33 J/g. The change of melting point and latent heat of salt after 1500 cycles is 0.48% and 7.84%, respectively, showing excellent cycle stability.

Abstract: Nitric oxide is a pleiotropic free radical produced by three nitric oxide synthases (NOS1–3), of which inducible NOS2 is involved in tumor initiation and progression. In this study, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and qRT-PCR experiments combined with bioinformatic analyses showed that NRF2 is a repressor of NOS2 gene by maintaining a distal enhancer located 22 kb downstream of TSS in an inactive state. Deletion of NRF2 leads to activation of the enhancer, which exerts a pioneering function before it is fully activated. Specifically, NRF2 controls the expression of NOS2 in response to intracellular oxidative stress and extracellular oxygen pressure. We found that abrogation of NOS2 expression by siRNAs partially reduced the ability of WT Panc-1 cells to form 3D spheroids, but strongly reduced the formation of 3D spheroids by NRF2-depleted Panc-1 cells. Mechanistically, this effect correlates with the finding that NOS2 and nitric oxide stimulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in NRF2-depleted Panc-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. We also found that knockdown of NOS2 leads to blockade of 3D matrigel invasion of NRF2-depleted PDAC cells, demonstrating that a short-circuit in the reciprocal regulation of NOS2 and NRF2 attenuates the malignancy of PDAC cells. In summary, we show for the first time that: (i) NRF2 is a suppressor of NOS2 in pancreatic cancer cells; (ii) NRF2 binds to and inactivates an enhancer located 22 kb downstream of TSS of the NOS2 gene; (iii) activation of NOS2 requires suppression of NRF2; (iv) NOS2 is required for NRF2-depleted Panc-1 cells to maintain their malignancy and invasiveness.

Abstract: Peroxisomes are ubiquitous cell organelles involved in various metabolic pathways. In order to properly function, several cofactors, substrates and products of peroxisomal enzymes need to pass the organellar membrane. So far only a few transporter proteins have been identified. We analysed peroxisomal membrane fractions purified from the yeast Hansenula polymorpha by untargeted label-free quantitation mass spectrometry. As expected, several known peroxisome-associated proteins were enriched in the peroxisomal membrane fraction. In addition, several other proteins were enriched, including mitochondrial transport proteins. Localization studies revealed that one of them, the mitochondrial phosphate carrier Mir1, has a dual localization on mitochondria and peroxisomes. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of dual sorting, we localized Mir1 in cells lacking Pex3 or Pex19, two peroxins that play a role in targeting of peroxisomal membrane proteins. In these cells Mir1 only localized to mitochondria, indicating that Pex3 and Pex19 are required to sort Mir1 to peroxisomes. Analysis of the localization of truncated versions of Mir1 in wild-type H. polymorpha cells revealed that most of them localized to mitochondria, but only one, consisting of the transmembrane domains 3–6, was peroxisomal. Peroxisomal localization of this construct was lost in a MIR1 deletion strain, indicating that full-length Mir1 was required for the localization of the truncated protein to peroxisomes. Our data suggest that only full-length Mir1 sorts to peroxisomes, while Mir1 contains multiple regions with mitochondrial sorting information. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD050324.

Abstract: The scaffold protein 14-3-3ζ is an established regulator of adipogenesis and postnatal adiposity. We and others have demonstrated the 14-3-3ζ interactome to be diverse and dynamic, and it can be examined to identify novel regulators of physiological processes, including adipogenesis. In the present study, we sought to determine if factors that influence adipogenesis during the development of obesity could be identified in the 14-3-3ζ interactome found in white adipose tissue of lean or obese TAP-tagged-14-3-3ζ overexpressing mice. Using mass spectrometry, differences in the abundance of novel, as well as established, adipogenic factors within the 14-3-3ζ interactome could be detected in adipose tissues. One novel candidate was revealed to be plakoglobin, the homolog of the known adipogenic inhibitor, β-catenin, and herein, we report that plakoglobin is involved in adipocyte differentiation. Plakoglobin is expressed in murine 3T3-L1 cells and is primarily localized to the nucleus, where its abundance decreases during adipogenesis. Depletion of plakoglobin by siRNA inhibited adipogenesis and reduced PPARγ2 expression, and similarly, plakoglobin depletion in human adipose-derived stem cells also impaired adipogenesis and reduced lipid accumulation post-differentiation. Transcriptional assays indicated that plakoglobin does not participate in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, as its depletion did not affect Wnt3a-mediated transcriptional activity. Taken together, our results establish plakoglobin as a novel regulator of adipogenesis in vitro and highlights the ability of using the 14-3-3ζ interactome to identify potential pro-obesogenic factors.

Abstract: Background
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common forms of oral cancer and is known to have poor prognostic outcomes. Autophagy is known to be associated with aggressive tumor biology of OSCC. Hence, this study aimed to develop a novel therapeutic strategy against OSCC by targeting the autophagic pathway.
Methods
Immunoblotting, and confocal microscopy were used to examine the effect of tumor microenvironmental stressors on the autophagy activity. Cellular proliferation and migration assays were performed to assess the anti-cancer activity of standard chemotherapy and autophagy initiation inhibitors, either alone or in combination. High resolution mass-spectrometry based proteomic analysis was utilized to understand the mechanisms behind chemoresistance in OSCC models. Finally, immunohistochemistry was performed to determine associations between autophagy markers and clinicopathological characteristics.
Results
Tumor microenvironmental stressors were shown to induce autophagy activity in OSCC cell lines. Novel combinations of chemotherapy and autophagy inhibitors as well as different classes of autophagy inhibitors were identified. Combination of MRT68921 and SAR405 demonstrated marked synergy in their anti-proliferative activity and also showed synergy with chemotherapy in chemoresistant OSCC cell models. Autophagy was identified as one of the key pathways involved in mediating chemoresistance in OSCC. Furthermore, TGM2 was identified as a key upstream regulator of chemoresistance in OSCC models. Finally, positive staining for autophagosome marker LC3 was shown to be associated with low histological grade OSCC.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study identified a combination of novel autophagy inhibitors which can potently inhibit proliferation of both chemosensitive as well as chemoresistant OSCC cells and could be developed as a novel therapy against advanced OSCC tumors.

Abstract: DNA damage-induced autophagy is a new type of autophagy that differs from traditional macroautophagy; however, this type of autophagy has not been identified in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. Inositol polyphosphates are involved in the regulation of DNA damage repair and macroautophagy; however, whether inositol polyphosphates are involved in the regulation of DNA damage-induced autophagy remains unclear. In this study, we identified DNA damage-induced autophagy in C. albicans and systematically investigated the mechanisms of inositol polyphosphate pathway regulation. We found that the core machinery of macro autophagy is also essential for DNA damage-induced autophagy, and that inositol polyphosphate synthetases Kcs1, Ipk1, and Vip1 play a critical role in autophagy. In this study, we focused on Kcs1 and Vip1, which are responsible for the synthesis of inositol pyrophosphate. The kcs1Δ/Δ and vip1Δ/Δ strains exhibited reduced number of phagophore assembly sites (PAS) and autophagic bodies. The recruitment of autophagy-related gene 1 (Atg1) to PAS was significantly affected in the kcs1Δ/Δ and vip1Δ/Δ strains. Target of rapamycin complex 1 kinase activity was elevated in kcs1Δ/Δ and vip1Δ/Δ strains, which significantly inhibited the initiation of autophagy. Atg18 Localization was altered in these mutants. The absence of Kcs1 or Vip1 caused the downregulation of RAD53, a key gene in the DNA damage response. These data provide further understanding of the mechanism of autophagy regulation in C. albicans.

Abstract: Unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA) is a common complication of pregnancy that affects the health of pregnant women. Deficient endometrial decidualization has been associated with URSA. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. This study aims to explore the mechanisms of mitochondrial fission induced necroptosis in deficient decidualization in URSA, and explore the regulation of baicalin on this mechanism. Initially, decidual tissues were collected from patients with URSA and health controls. Subsequently, in vitro induced decidualization model of Telomerase-Immortalized Human Endometrial Stromal Cells (T-hESCs) was constructed. Additionally, murine models of URSA (CBA/J × DBA/2) and normal pregnancy (CBA/J × BALB/c) were established, respectively. The level of decidualization, necroptosis, and mitochondrial fission of decidual tissues from clinical samples were detected. The function of mitochondrial fission on necroptosis during decidualization in T-hESCs was assessed by enhancing or inhibiting mitochondrial fission or necroptosis. Finally, CBA/J × DBA/2 pregnant mice were administrated with different doses of baicalin or saline, and the expression of mitochondrial fission, necroptosis, and decidualization markers were verified. The results of the study demonstrated a significant decrease in decidualization markers in the decidual tissues of URSA patients (P < 0.05), along with an increase in the incidence of cell necroptosis (P < 0.05) and hyperactive mitochondrial fission (P < 0.05). In vitro experiments, LPS was induced to trigger necroptosis of T-hESCs during induced decidualization, and decidualization markers IGFBP1 and PRL were subsequently decreased (P < 0.05). Besides, the mitochondrial fission agonist Tyrphostin A9 was found to promote the level of necroptosis (P < 0.05) and induced deficient decidualization (P < 0.05), which could be rescued by mitochondrial fission inhibitor Mdivi-1 and necroptosis inhibitor Nec-1 (P < 0.05). In addition, baicalin was shown to reduce hyperactive mitochondrial fission (P < 0.05), necroptosis (P < 0.05) and ameliorate deficient decidualization in vitro and in URSA murine models (P < 0.05). Collectively, baicalin shows potential in ameliorating deficient decidualization in URSA by inhibiting mitochondrial fission-triggered necroptosis.

Abstract: We developed a dynamic smart window capable of demonstrating transparent, black, and mirror modes across the entire solar spectrum. We demonstrated that the surface-roughness-controlled WO3 film deposited by nano particle deposition system (NPDS) can achieve the black mode with almost zero solar heat transmittance (Tsol). In the Reversible Metal Electrodeposition (RME), device can block heat similar to the mirror mode. NPDS is a unique dry deposition method to enhance the light scattering effect. As a result, the transmittance was measured in the range of the entire solar spectrum (λ ∼ 300 nm–2500 nm), obtaining 0.81% and 0.56% of Tsol for the black and mirror modes, respectively. However, 61% of Tsol was obtained for the transparent mode, confirming stark differences in Tsol. Furthermore, a dynamic smart window of 4 cm2 in size was fabricated to study the temperature change within the model house upon exposure to an infrared lamp to monitor any increase in temperature during transparent, black, and mirror modes. As a result, the temperature increases within the model house during transmittance mode increased by 19.2 °C, while the temperature increases during black and mirror modes slightly by 4.1 °C and 3.8 °C, respectively. The dynamic smart window was able to reduce the indoor temperature by more than 4.7 folds during the black/mirror modes. These findings confirmed that we developed an RME device capable of completely blocking sunlight to minimize indoor temperature change across the entire solar spectrum.

Abstract: Long-term spaceflights affect the structural changes in brain, alter motor or cognitive function and associated development of neuro-optic syndrome in astronauts. Studies addressing the impact of microgravity on brain cells are very limited. Herein, we employed microglial (CHME3) and glioblastoma (U87MG and A172) cells to study their molecular and functional adaptations under simulated microgravity (SMG) exposure. A reduction in cell viability and proliferation with decreased levels of PCNA were observed in these cells. SMG caused extensive DNA damage with an increase in γH2A.X (ser139) phosphorylation and differential activation/expression of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins including ATM, ATR, Chk1, Chk2 and p53 in all the three cell lines. Unlike CHME3, the ATM/Chk2-dependent DDR pathway was activated in glioblastoma cells suggesting a marked difference in the adaptation between normal and cancer cells to SMG. Five different classes of DNA repair pathways including BER, NER, MMR, NHEJ and HR were suppressed in both cell lines with the notable exception of NHEJ (Ku70/80 and DNA-PK) activation in U87MG cells. SMG induced mitochondrial apoptosis with increased expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and reduced Bcl-2 level. SMG triggered apoptosis simultaneously via ERK1/2 and AKT activation, and inhibition of GSK3β activity which was reversed by MEK1 and PI3K inhibitors. Taken together, our study revealed that microgravity is a strong stressor to trigger DNA damage and apoptosis through activation of ERK1/2 and AKT, and impairment of DNA repair capacity, albeit with a cell-type difference in DDR and NHEJ regulation, in microglial and glioblastoma cells.

AKAP2-anchored extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) regulates cardiac myofibroblast migration,

Abstract: Cardiac fibrosis is a major cause of dysfunctions and arrhythmias in failing hearts. At the cellular level fibrosis is mediated by cardiac myofibroblasts, which display an increased migratory capacity and secrete large amounts of extracellular matrix. These properties allow myofibroblasts to invade, remodel and stiffen the myocardium and eventually alter cardiac function. While the enhanced ability of cardiac myofibroblasts to migrate has been proposed to contribute to the initiation of the fibrotic process, the molecular mechanisms controlling their motile function have been poorly defined. In this context, our current findings indicate that A-kinase anchoring protein 2 (AKAP2) associates with actin at the leading edge of migrating cardiac myofibroblasts. Proteomic analysis of the AKAP2 interactome revealed that this anchoring protein assembles a signaling complex composed of the extracellular regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and its upstream activator Grb2 that mediates the activation of ERK in cardiac myofibroblasts. Silencing AKAP2 expression results in a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of ERK1 and its downstream effector WAVE2, a protein involved in actin polymerization, and impairs the ability of cardiac myofibroblasts to migrate. Importantly, disruption of the interaction between AKAP2 and F-actin using cell-permeant competitor peptides, inhibits the activation of the ERK-WAVE2 signaling axis, resulting in a reduction of the translocation of Arp2 to the leading-edge membrane and in inhibition of cardiac myofibroblast migration. Collectively, these findings suggest that AKAP2 functions as an F-actin bound molecular scaffold mediating the activation of an ERK1-dependent promigratory transduction pathway in cardiac myofibroblasts.

Abstract: Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is characterized by early metastasis and high mortality rates, underscoring the need for deeper understanding of these aspects. This study explores the role of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) driven by zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in OvCa progression and metastasis. Specifically, this study explored whether ZEB1 promotes glycolysis and assessed the potential involvement of GLUT3 in this process in OvCa cells. Our findings revealed that ZEB1 and GLUT3 were excessively expressed and closely correlated in OvCa. Mechanistically, ZEB1 activates the transcription of GLUT3 by binding to its promoter region. Increased expression of GLUT3 driven by ZEB1 dramatically enhances glycolysis, and thus fuels Warburg Effect to promote OvCa progression and metastasis. Consistently, elevated ZEB1 and GLUT3 expression in clinical OvCa is correlated with poor prognosis, reinforcing the profound contribution of ZEB1-GLUT3 axis to OvCa. These results suggest that activation of GLUT3 expression by ZEB1 is crucial for the proliferation and metastasis of OvCa via fueling glycolysis, shedding new light on OvCa treatment.

Abstract: Measuring specific contact resistivity (ρc) in test vehicles representative of the final solar cell is critical for interface engineering in high efficiency devices such as silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell. The Transfer Length Method (TLM) is commonly used for layer sheet resistance (Rsheet) and ρc evaluation and is valid for samples with charge transport confined in one conductive layer only. For metal/Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) interface ρc evaluation from SHJ cells precursors, there is a need to prevent any contribution from the conductive c-Si. In this work, we investigated by simulation and experimental approach the parameters restricting the current confinement inside the TCO. The first one is the mid-gap trap density (Dit) at the a-Si:H/c-Si interface which has no strong impact on current confinement on simulated TLM test structures. The second one is the variation of the activation energy (Ea=Ec−EF) of the a-Si:H contact layers. Both simulated and experimental results have demonstrated that three current distribution regimes are possible in the TLM test structure depending on the Ea value with only one regime, for Ea between 0.6 and 1.4 eV, enabling to isolate the metal/TCO interface. This condition is mandatory to maintain a sufficiently high potential barrier for electrons at the interfaces a-Si:H(p)/a-Si:H(i)/c-Si(n) and thus lateral current in the TCO layer to apply TLM on SHJ devices.

Abstract: The proliferative expansion of cardiac fibroblasts (CF) contributes towards cardiac fibrosis, which results in myocardial stiffening, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure. CF sense and respond to increased stiffness of their local extracellular matrix, modulating their phenotype towards increased collagen synthesis and higher proliferation, leading potentially to a vicious circle of positive feedback. Here we describe a novel mechanism that mediates increased CF proliferation in response to a pathologically stiff Exteracellular matrix (ECM). The mechanism we describe is independent of the well-characterised mechano-sensitive transcript factors, YAP-TEAD and MKL1-SRF, which our data indicate are only responsible for part of the genes induced by stiffened ECM. Instead, our data identify Nuclear Factor-Y (NF-Y) as a novel mechanosensitive transcription factor, which mediates enhanced CF proliferation in response to a stiff ECM. We show that levels of NF-YA protein, the major regulatory subunit of NF-Y, and NF-Y transcriptional activity, are increased by a stiff ECM. Indeed, NF-Y activity drives the expression of multiple cell-cycle genes. Furthermore, NF-YA protein levels are dependent on FAK signalling suggesting a mechanistic link to ECM composition. Consistent with its role as a mechano-sensor, inhibition of NF-Y using siRNA or dominant negative mutant blocks CF proliferation on plastic in vitro, which models a stiff ECM, whereas ectopic expression of NF-YA increases the proliferation of cells interacting under conditions that model a physiologically soft ECM. In summary, our data demonstrate that NF-Y is a biomechanically sensitive transcription factor that promotes CF proliferation in a model of pathologically stiffened ECM.
