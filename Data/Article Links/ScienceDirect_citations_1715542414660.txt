Abstract: We investigate the implications of using partial or patterned illumination for luminescence imaging of photovoltaic modules. Partial illumination induces local photovoltage variations that drive lateral current flow into non-illuminated cell regions, causing the average injection level to vary over the course of luminescence measurement. The extent of lateral current depends on material properties and is especially significant for high-efficiency devices such as the silicon heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) modules that we investigate. We compare four module imaging methods including large-area illumination, scanning-laser illumination, contactless electroluminescence, and pattern-illuminated photoluminescence. By evaluating the statistical correlation among the different methods under varying laser fluences, we conclude that most methods converge to similar results at matched photon dose per cell (not laser power density) for the modules that we study, while pattern-illuminated photoluminescence yields distinct images from the other techniques regardless of the illumination power. Our combined analysis using multiple luminescence imaging techniques gives specific insight into the causes of HIT module degradation, including suspected degradation of the transparent conductive oxide and passivation layer.

Abstract: Interface property has been considered one of the most critical factors affecting the performance of semiconductor devices. In this work, we demonstrate an efficient surface passivation for the interface between Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and CdS buffer layer by using UV-ozone treatment at room temperature. The passivation led to a significant enhancement of short circuit current density (Jsc) of the device from 11.70 mA/cm2 to 18.34 mA/cm2 and thus efficiency of the CZTS solar cells from 3.18% to 5.55%. The study of surface chemistry has revealed that the UV-ozone exposure led to formation of a Sn–O rich surface on CZTS, which passivates the dangling bonds and forms an ultra-thin energy barrier layer at the interface of CZTS/CdS. The barrier is considered to be responsible for the reduction of non-radiative recombination loss in the solar cells as confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) measurement. The elongated lifetime of minority carriers in the CZTS solar cells by time-resolved PL has further verified the interface passivation effect induced by UV-ozone treatment. This work provides a fast, simple yet very effective approach for surface passivation of CZTS film to boost the performance of CZTS solar cells.

Abstract: Inkjet‐printable VO2 inks were developed for fabrication of infrared thermochromic VO2 nanoparticle films on the nanoporous polyethylene (nanoPE) substrates. The surface morphology and roughness of the printed films were investigated via scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The obtained films demonstrated excellent infrared optical properties with large infrared optical modulation (32.4% at 20 µm wavelength). Moreover, the inkjet printed large area VO2 nanoparticle films of 560 cm2 had good uniformity, which the difference in infrared transmittance of the 40 regions on the film was within 0.3%. These promising results help to promote the applications of this material in optoelectronic devices such as intelligent camouflage and optical switches.

Abstract: We report on strategies that improve Se-derivative based solar cells performance. With this aim, a compact thin film based on ZnO nanoparticles is deposited onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) as an electron-transport layer, in thermally evaporated GaxSe10-x based solar cells. ZnO nanoparticles films are synthesized by sol-gel process whereas GaxSe10-x material is obtained by mechanical alloying. Using current-voltage measurements, impedance spectroscopy, and capacitance-voltage profiling, device characteristics and performance limiting factors are revealed and discussed. Particularly, the use of ZnO nanoparticles results in improved device performance as well as long-term stability. In comparison to Se-only devices with the structure FTO/Se/Au (power conversion efficiency of 0.98%), under 100 mW/cm2 AM 1.5 G illumination the devices achieved a power conversion efficiency of 2.7% with the structure FTO/ZnO/GaSe9/Au (open circuit voltage of 0.71 V, short-circuit current of 7.9 mA/cm2). Hence, an increase of around 175% in the power conversion efficiency is obtained in comparison to Se-only devices. In addition, the effect of others parameters, like thickness of the active layer as well as the gallium contents in the alloy, are discussed.

Abstract: Transition metal oxides (TMOs) have attracted considerable attention due to their variety of chromogenic properties. Among them, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) has gained significant interest in respect of multichromism associated with orange, green and blue colors. Herein, we report a simple and easy method for the fabrication of Mo doped V2O5 thick films, leading to improved cyclability. Molybdenum doped vanadium pentoxide powders were synthesized from one single polyol route through the precipitation of an intermediate precursor: molybdenum doped vanadium ethyleneglycolate (Mo doped VEG). The as-synthesized Mo-doped V2O5 exhibits improved electrochromic performance in terms of capacity, cycling stability, and color contrast compared to single-component V2O5 in lithium as well as sodium based electrolyte. The improvement in EC performances lies in films of higher porosity as well as higher diffusion coefficients. To conclude, an electrochromic device combining Mo-V2O5 to WO3.2H2O, via a PMMA-lithium based electrolyte membrane exhibits simultaneously reversible color change from yellow to green for Mo-V2O5 and from blue to yellow white for WO3.2H2O with a cycling stability up to 10 000 cycles.

Abstract: The application of single-phase ZnO in hydrogen production through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water reduction is limited because of its unability to utilize photon energy of visible light and high carrier recombination rate. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) plasmonic photoanode consisting of Au nanoparticles/ZnFe2O4 nanosheets coated onto ZnO nanotube arrays (Au/ZnFe2O4/ZnO NTAs) is rationally designed for hydrogen generation via PEC water splitting. The measurements preformed under simulated solar light and visible light irradiation show that the hot-electron injection of Au nanoparticles (NPs) significantly enhances PEC water splitting for hydrogen generation of 3D plasmonic Au/ZnFe2O4/ZnO NTAs photoanode. Benefiting from the outstanding visible light harvesting ability of ZnFe2O4 nanosheets, efficient suppression of carrier recombination by a favorable band alignment, hot-electron injection of Au NPs and large surface area of 3D architecture, the 3D plasmonic Au/ZnFe2O4/ZnO NTAs photoanode exhibits enhanced PEC water splitting for hydrogen generation. The hydrogen generation rate obtained by 3D plasmonic Au/ZnFe2O4/ZnO NTAs photoanode is 1.5 and 5.7-fold of ZnO/ZnFe2O and ZnO NTAs photoanodes, respectively, at 0.6 V versus reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) under simulated solar light irradiation.

Abstract: Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) has been widely reported to affect cancer cell growth and survival and recent studies suggest it may alter cell metabolism. In this study, the effects of NAT1 deletion on mitochondrial function was examined in 2 human cell lines, breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 and colon carcinoma HT-29 cells. Using a Seahorse XFe96 Flux Analyzer, NAT1 deletion was shown to decrease oxidative phosphorylation with a significant loss in respiratory reserve capacity in both cell lines. There also was a decrease in glycolysis without a change in glucose uptake. The changes in mitochondrial function was due to a decrease in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, which could be reversed with the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor dichloroacetate. In the MDA-MB-231 and HT-29 cells, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was attenuated either by an increase in phosphorylation or a decrease in total protein expression. These results may help explain some of the cellular events that have been reported recently in cell and animal models of NAT1 deficiency.

Abstract: Background
CCR5 is a chemokine receptor expressed by various populations including leukocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelium. Δ32 polymorphism of CCR5 gene has been connected with, inter alia, cardiovascular disease development. The aim of our study was to evaluate impact of CCR5 variant on CD34+ and CD34+VEGFR2+ cells - populations involved in cardiovascular system homeostasis and regeneration.
Methods and results
We have examined 170 Polish subjects from Pomeranian region. The analysis concerned CCR5 polymorphism and flow cytometry evaluation of whole blood cells. Our results indicate that individuals with at least one CCR5-Δ32 allele are characterized by greater number of CD34+CXCR4+, CD34+VEGFR2+ and CD34+VEGFR2+c-Kit + cells than their wild type counterparts. This group also exhibits more beneficial values of renal function parameters.
Conclusion
Maintaining greater size of CD34+ and CD34+VEGFR2+ populations as well as proper kidney function may constitute mechanisms that connect chemokine receptor polymorphism with cardiovascular system health.

Abstract: In this study, a novel microencapsulated phase change material paraffin@Cu-Cu2O/CNTs was successfully prepared by hydrothermal reduction and in situ deposition method, in which paraffin as the core, Cu, Cu2O and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the shell. SEM and TEM results proved that the microcapsules have a core-shell structure, the CNTs were irregularly wrapped on the shell, and the diameter of the microcapsules was about 600-800 nm. The melting temperature and latent heat of the paraffin@Cu-Cu2O/CNTs microcapsules were 61.17 °C and 81.31Jg-1, respectively, and the encapsulation rate of the microcapsules was calculated to be 41.53% from the results of the DSC measurement. Due to the shell material, the paraffin@Cu-Cu2O/CNTs microcapsules displayed excellent thermal stability, its thermal decomposition temperature is increased by 97 °C compared to paraffin. Moreover, the paraffin@Cu-Cu2O/CNTs microcapsules were dispersed in water to form a new kind of slurry, such fluid exhibited great improvement in terms of thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, light absorption performance and photo-thermal conversion efficiency than that of paraffin@Cu-Cu2O microcapsules slurry. Therefore, the high heat storage capability and excellent photo-thermal conversion performance of the paraffin@Cu-Cu2O/CNTs microcapsule slurry make it to be the most potential heat transfer fluid for direct absorption solar collector.

Abstract: The cancer cell population is heterogeneous, and cancer stem cells (CSCs) are important for tumor growth and maintenance. The CSC population is associated with different neoplastic characteristics, such as cell migration, resistance to apoptosis, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. To increase the knowledge of CSCs in canine prostate cancer (PC), we characterized CSC markers in canine PC tissues and tumorspheres. We performed immunohistochemistry of OCT3/4, Nestin, NANOG, CD44 and CD24 in 10 normal canine prostatic tissue samples, 10 prostatic hyperplastic (PH) tissue samples and 28 PC tissue samples. Then, we established two canine prostate cancer cell cultures and characterized the CSC profile of tumorspheres grown from these cultures. Normal and PH tissues were positive for Nestin, NANOG, CD44 and CD24 only in the basal cell layer. OCT3/4 was expressed in the luminal cells of normal and PH tissues. There was no significant difference in Nestin expression among the prostatic tissues. However, we found higher expression of NANOG and CD44 in canine PC tissues than that in normal and PH tissues. Tumorspheres from canine prostate cancer cells express OCT3/4, Nestin, NANOG and CD44, indicating that these markers may be potential cancer stem cell markers in canine PC. The results obtained can be useful to better characterize the stem cell population in canine prostatic cancer and to guide future studies in comparative oncology.

Abstract: CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) plants technologies use the concentration of solar energy on a receiver to produce heat and then electricity by a thermodynamical process. A solar absorber material is used to convert the energy carried by light into heat. This type of material works at high temperatures (up to 1000 °C) under a highly concentrated solar flux (up to x1000 or more). Optical properties determine the performance of absorbers and it is thus necessary to measure their spectral absorptance and emittance. Solar absorptance is directly linked to the capacity of the absorber material to convert the solar flux into heat. Emittance drives the radiative thermal losses for the heated absorber and depends on the absorber temperature. The characterization of a material in operational conditions at high temperatures requires advanced apparatuses, and different measurement methods exist for the characterization of these two quantities of relevance regarding an absorber. A Round Robin Test (RRT) was conducted with the objective of comparing different new optical apparatuses and methods for measuring the emittance or luminance of various solar absorbers in air. Measurements were carried out directly at temperatures up to 560 °C while heating the samples, and also indirectly by hemispherical reflectance measurements at room temperature. In this paper, the Round Robin Test procedure to compare apparatuses is described, as well as the corresponding reflectance and emittance results on four types of materials. In addition, a discussion of some factors of influence over high temperature measurements in air and of the observed discrepancies among results from the evaluators is presented. The reliability of reflectance/emittance measurements is also demonstrated and statistics of deviations from the mean value are analysed. These allow us to infer information about measurement reproducibility. The reflectance spectra of all samples after high temperature measurements in air (up to 500 °C) do not show any significant changes.

Abstract: Elevated temperature due to sunshine and self-heating can be detrimental to the performance and reliability of solar cells. In this work, we use theoretical calculations to identify that polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is chemically stable and inexpensive, can be a highly efficient thermal emitter for cooling flexible thin-film solar cells. It is shown that a 200 µm-thick planar PDMS layer is capable of achieving high emissivity over 0.9 in the whole IR regime of 4–26 µm. The emissivity can be further increased to near-unity by introducing pyramid structures to the surface in the range of 8–13 µm, where environment radiation is negligible. According to the calculated radiative cooling rates and realistic power conversion efficiencies, we show that a pyramid-structured PDMS layer can significantly lower the temperature of an organic, a perovskite and a micro-crystalline (µc)-Si flexible solar cell by 11 °C, 12 °C and 16 °C, respectively. This work may provide important guidance to the design of high performance and reliable flexible solar cells.

Abstract: Point defects play a crucial role in the performance of functional materials. The most important extrinsic elements for point defects in titanium-based photocatalysts are oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen due to their large chemical affinity and substantial solubility with titanium. Therefore, understanding the nature of such defects will help designing high-performance photocatalysts for various applications. Herein, we make use of alloyed multipodal Ti-Nb-Zr-O nanotubes (MPNTs) annealed under different atmospheres: Air, O2, and H2 for enhanced photoelectrochemical water-splitting. Structural analysis using XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS confirmed the formation of a single mixed oxide Ti-Nb-Zr-O in a strained-anatase crystal structure in both Air and Oxygen atmospheres. However, XPS fitting showed the presence of ZrTiO4 and Ti3+ upon annealing in Hydrogen atmosphere. Valence band XPS analysis confirms the presence of valence band tail states causing band-gap reduction in the hydrogen-annealed samples, with an absorption tail reaching NIR/Vis region. Mott-Schottky analysis showed 4 orders of magnitude increase in the carrier density for the samples annealed in hydrogen atmosphere compared to those annealed in Air or O2, owing to the presence of Ti3+ defects/oxygen vacancies, titanium substitution by niobium, and the valence band tail states. These synergistic effects resulted in almost 25-fold enhancement in the photocurrent compared to the performance of the samples annealed in Oxygen or Air. It is thus concluded that annealing in a reducing atmosphere produces disordered and defective structure. Accordingly, the optical and electronic properties of complex metal oxides exhibiting poor performance can be manipulated to produce promising candidates for enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting.

Abstract: Recently, a new composite “LiCl inside Multi-Wall Carbon NanoTubes” (LiCl/MWCNT) has been suggested as water sorbent for Adsorption Thermal Energy Storage (ATES), because it has a large thermal storage capacity of 1.7 kJ/g for a daily heat storage cycle. This work addresses the results of the study of water sorption dynamics on the novel composite loaded into representative small scale fragments of a common finned flat-tube HEx. The study consists of four parts: (1) shaping the LiCl/MWCNT composite as grains using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a binder; (2) analysis of sorption equilibrium for the pair “LiCl/ MWCNT/PVA – water”; (3) measuring the thermal storage capacity of the granulated LiCl/ MWCNT/PVA composite; (4) investigation of water sorption dynamics on the LiCl/MWCNT/PVA under typical conditions of the daily storage cycle. It is shown that the thermal storage capacity of the LiCl/MWCNT/PVA composite equals 1.5–1.6 kJ/g. The specific power reaches 4.2 and 9.8 kW/kg of the heat release and thermal storage stages, respectively. The results obtained show that the working pair “LiCl/MWCNT/PVA – water” appears to be advantageous for ATES.

Abstract: In this paper, the impact of the plasma process for III-V/Ge heterostructure etching on both the morphology and the photovoltaic performance is investigated for the fabrication of multijunction solar cells with a through cell via contact architecture. Three different plasma chemistries (BCl3/Cl2, SiCl4/Cl2, and SiCl4/H2/Cl2) have been studied in order to obtain anisotropic etching through the multijunction heterostructure without inducing photovoltaic performance loss. SiCl4-based plasma chemistries have been found more suitable to achieve deep via hole etching (∼ 30 µm) without lateral etching. The study suggests that SiClx passivation is more efficient to protect the sidewalls compared to BClx. The addition of H2 in SiCl4/Cl2 mixture appears to reinforce the sidewall passivation and thus to limit the lateral etching. III-V/Ge triple junction solar cells with standard grid line and busbar front and back contact have been fabricated on which shallow via-holes have been etched in order to assess the associated photovoltaic performance loss to each plasma etching process. Despite the fact that similar hole sidewall profiles are obtained, the electrical performances are plasma chemistry dependant. This study demonstrates that the SiCl4/H2/Cl2 process presents the lowest losses with almost no induced open-circuit voltage degradation, which makes it promising for the through cell via contact architecture recently proposed for concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) solar cells.

Abstract: Owing to the chemical resistance, facile production and high electrochemical activity, layered Ni(OH)2 is a useful electrode material for supercapacitors and electrochromic (EC) devices. Nevertheless, the poor electrical conductivity of Ni(OH)2 and its strong tendency to restack during processing have restricted its applications. In this study, we have modified Ni(OH)2 surfaces with a layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) using (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS) as a linker. A nanospace can be created by the conductive layer of PEDOT:PSS wrapped on the Ni(OH)2 nanosheet, which can avoid the reaggregation. Therefore, the Ni(OH)2/PEDOT (P–Ni(OH)2) composites display greater electrochemical activity and kinetics due to the favorable conductivity and interfacial area, suitable for supercapacitor and EC applications. The flexible electrochromic device (ECD) and an asymmetric supercapacitor (AS) incorporating P–Ni(OH)2 are also evaluated in this article. The P–Ni(OH)2 based ECD exhibits superior mechanical stability and the AS also shows excellent cycling stability.

Abstract: MicroRNAs are classified as small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression mainly through targeting the 3′UTR region of mRNAs. A great number of miRNAs play important role in the regulation of signaling pathways in normal and cancer cells. Here, we predicted hsa-miR-5195-3p (miR-5195-3p) as a potential regulator of TGFβ signaling and investigated its effect on TGFB-R1, TGFB-R2, SMAD2, SMAD3 and SMAD4 transcripts which are key players of TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway. Overexpression of miR-5195 in HCT116 cells resulted in a significant reduction of TGFB-R1, SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 at the mRNA level which was confirmed using RT-qPCR. Consistently, western blot analysis confirmed that miR-5195 overexpression in HCT116 cells resulted in downregulation of TGFBR1 at the protein level. Furthermore, dual luciferase analysis verified the direct interaction of miR-5195 with TGFB-R1 and SMAD4 3′UTR sequences in SW480 cells. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that miR-5195 overexpression significantly increased the sub-G1 and decreased the G-1 cell populations in both SW480 and HCT116 cell lines. Finally, miR-5195 overexpression significantly downregulated c-MYC and cyclin D1 but upregulated p21 genes. Overall, our results indicated that miR-5195 modulates TGFβ signaling pathway and affects the cell cycle progression through targeting TGFB-R1, TGFB-R2, SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 transcripts.

Abstract: In search of novel, non-toxic and high performance materials for the use in quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs), we have investigated the effect of adatoms (nitrogen, boron and phosphorus) on carboxyl edge-functionalized graphene quantum dot (COOH-GQD) through the state-of-the-art first principles calculation based on density functional theory. The HOMO, LUMO and energy gaps are analysed in order to check the modulation in electronic properties by the foreign atom through hybrid functional B3LYP with 6-31G basis set. Binding mechanism, molecular electrostatic potential (MESP), and charge transfer are investigated to study the electron injection and charge separation in doped/undoped COOH-GQD. Optical properties show broad spectrum in the visible range favorable to harvest solar light. To envisage the application of adatom doped COOH-GQD in QDSC, the solar cell parameters such as open circuit voltage (Voc), Fill factor (FF), short circuit current density (Jsc) and efficiency (η) are presented. The efficiency of COOH-GQD increases by 22–30% after the substitutional doping of nitrogen, boron and phosphorus. Maximum efficiency is achieved in case of phosphorus doping due to its more electron donating nature which will inject more electrons in TiO2 surface. Our findings show that these new sensitizers based on GQD are promising candidates for QDSCs applications.

Abstract: We have recently found that conjugation of acrolein with a 50 kDa protein(s) is strongly associated with tissue damage during brain infarction. In the current study, the identity and function of the 50 kDa protein(s) conjugated with acrolein during brain infarction were investigated. The 50 kDa protein(s) conjugated with acrolein were identified as α- and β-tubulins. Ten cysteine residues in α- and β-tubulins (Cys25, 295, 347 and 376 in α-tubulin and Cys12, 129, 211, 239, 303 and 354 in β-tubulin) were mainly conjugated with acrolein. Since two cysteine residues of α-tubulin (Cys347 and 376) and four cysteine residues of β-tubulin (Cys12, 129, 239 and 354) were located at the interaction site of α- and β-tubulins, association between α- and β-tubulins to form microtubules was strongly inhibited by conjugation with acrolein. Accordingly, dendritic spine extension consisting of microtubules was greatly inhibited in acrolein-treated Neuro2a cells. The results strongly suggest that acrolein contributes to the functional losses in brain signaling through its conjugation with α- and β-tubulins.

Abstract: In this study, it was carried out the development of a poly(ethylene glycol)/cellulose phase change reactive composite as latent heat storage material for cooling application and determination of its thermal stability. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was grafted onto a cellulose backbone as solid–solid phase change material. The change in the surface morphology of the PEG1000 was studied by using a polarised optical microscopy (POM) instrument. Thermal analysis and thermal stability upon usage of the phase change composite material were performed by using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) instrument. The chemical analysis of the PCM composite was carried out by using a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) instrument. Phase change composite melted and crystallized 10 times to determine the thermal stability. The PEG1000 grafted cellulose phase change composite before 10 times thermal cycling absorbed 78.6 J/g of heat at 7.7 °C and released 74.4 J/g at − 5.4 °C whereas the PEG1000 grafted cellulose phase change composite after 10 times thermal cycling absorbed 92.7 J/g of heat at 8.3 °C and released 83.2 J/g at 1 °C during melting and freezing respectively. It was observed that Cp of the PEG1000 grafted cellulose sample was decreased compared to Cp of the pristine PEG1000. There was a considerable difference between crystal structures of pristine PEG1000 and PEG1000 grafted cellulose phase change composite. The disappearance of diisocyanate peak of TDI observed at 2228.34 cm−1 in PEG1000 grafted cellulose sample before and after 10 times thermal cycling was accepted as the evidence of polyurethane formation. As a result, PEG1000 grafted cellulose phase change composite was found as a potential thermal energy storage material for cooling application in relevant systems.

Abstract: Staphylococcal food poisoning is a disease that originates significant health and economic losses and is caused by Staphylococcus aureus strains able to produce enterotoxins. The aim of this work is to go further on the study of the volatile exometabolome of S. aureus using an advanced gas chromatographic technique. Enterotoxic and non-enterotoxic strains were assessed. The volatile exometabolome profile comprised 240 volatiles belonging to ten chemical families. This volatiles were mainly by-products of branched-chain amino acids and methionine degradation, pyruvate metabolism, diacetyl pathway, oxidative stress and carotenoid cleavage. Metabolites released by the first two pathways were produced in higher contents by the enterotoxic strains. This study add further insights to S. aureus volatile exometabolome, and also shows that by applying it, it is possible to distinguish strains of S. aureus by the number of produced enterotoxins, which is especially important from the food safety point of view.

Abstract: In this research work, a three dimensionally (3D) interconnected porous polystyrene-carbon nanotubes (PS-CNT) polyHIPE foam was developed as a phase change material (PCM) scaffold for photo-to-thermal energy storage applications. Structural and thermal properties of the novel phase change composite were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X–ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffused reflectance spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, and laser flash analysis. The paraffin/PS-CNT composite containing 1 wt% CNTs exhibited a thermal conductivity as high as 0.39 Wm-1 K-1, 1.62 fold higher than that of pure paraffin. The highly porous structure of the prepared foam led to a high PCM loading of 82.5%, a high latent heat of 119.3 J g-1 and a melting point of 56.88 °C. The prepared composite preserved its stable thermophysical properties after 100 melting/solidification cycles. The enthalpy of paraffin increased about 3.5% after infiltrating into the PS-CNT polyHIPE foam. Further, the composite displayed excellent shape stability, which prevented the leakage of phase change material during phase transitions. Incorporation of carbon nanotubes in the polyHIPE foam led to black color of the composite leading to an increase in the light absorbance efficiency and especially the light-to-thermal energy conversion efficiency (90%).

Abstract: We report on the first single-junction GaSb solar cell epitaxially grown on a Si substrate. A control stand-alone GaSb solar cell was primarily fabricated, which demonstrated a 5.90% efficiency (AM1.5G). The preparation, growth and manufacturing procedures were then adapted to create the GaSb-on-Si solar cell. The hybrid device resulted in a degraded efficiency for which comparison between experimental and simulated data revealed dominant non-radiative recombination processes. Material and electrical characterization also highlighted the impact of anti-phase domains and boundaries and threading dislocation density on the shunt resistance of the cell. Nevertheless, the GaSb-on-Si cell performance is close to recent results on the integration of GaSb solar cells on GaAs, despite a much larger lattice mismatch (12% vs 8%). Routes for improvement, concerning the material quality and cell structure, are proposed. This work lays the foundations of a GaSb-based multi-junction solar cell monolithically integrated on Si.

Abstract: Environment friendly, thin and flexible devices require the synthesis of Indium-free new transparent conducting materials (TCM) with improved structural, thermal, electrical and optical properties. To overcome the critical issues raised by thinning the TCM, we propose a multilayer structure in which nanogranular Ag film obtained by supersonic cluster beam deposition is sandwiched in between Alluminum doped Zinc Oxide (AZO) thin layers. The introduction of the nanogranular Ag film, when compared to the standard sputtered one, yields higher optical transmittance in the technologically relevant VIS-NIR region and superior mechanical reliability while preserving low electrical resistance. The present results open new perspectives to exploit the nanogranular nature of conductive films, synthesized via Supersonic Cluster Beam Deposition, to engineer transparent conducting materials.

Abstract: In this paper, composites based on a standard mortar and two commercial microencapsulated phase change materials (PCMs) with nominal melting point of 23 °C and 26 °C in different percentage were produced and characterized. To this aim, an innovative experimental setup, able to contemporarily test two different samples subjected to the same temperature profile was designed and realized. The experimental results were then used to validate a numerical model, implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics. Finally, a parametric analysis was carried out to define optimized melting temperature for the PCM for Mediterranean application, aiming at reducing the overall energy consumption as well as to improve the comfort conditions inside buildings both during winter and summer. The results demonstrated that an optimal melting temperature of 27 °C is achieved under Sicilian climatic condition. Furthermore, adding 15 wt% of optimized PCM allows to improve the comfort conditions of about 15% compared to standard solutions based on pure cement mortars.

Abstract: To optimize the visible light driven photovoltaic (PV) performance of orthorhombic n- type AgInS2 (AIS) fabricated thin film semiconductor (SC), in-situ incorporation of metallic gold [Au (0)] with very low concentrations (0.2–0.8%) has been done into AIS nanocrystal (NC). Sensitivity and stability of the SCs have been reported by chronoamperometric measurement. The optimized photocurrent density (7.1 mA/cm2) was obtained for AIS@Au (0.6%) and PV efficiency (η) is increased by 3.30 times (approx.) with respect to the host AIS SC. Most importantly the Incident Photon to current Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) measurement within the wavelength range of 450–750 nm reveals the definite wavelength of visible light energy corresponds to 560 nm at which about 80% efficiency was obtained for AIS@Au (0.6%). Powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) study, Transmission Electron Microscopic (TEM) analysis, UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy and Photoluminescence (PL) measurement indicate the presence as well as the importance of the metallic dopant in the hybrid nanomaterial. Mott-schottky plot reveals the flat band potential (0.22 V Vs. reference hydrogen electrode) for AIS SC as well as majority carrier (here e-) density (ND) 2.63 × 1016 cm−3 for AIS@Au (0.6%) which help to predict the higher PV efficiency of hybrid material fabricated thin film SC.

Abstract: VO2/CoFe2O4 nanoparticle composites were synthesized by hydrothermal method combined with annealing treatment. The nanocomposites consist of quasi-spherical nanoparticles with an average size of about 70 nm. The thermochromic properties of the nanocomposite films can be modulated by changing film thickness and the content of CoFe2O4 in the nanocomposites. The band gap of the VO2/CoFe2O4 nanocomposites increases with increasing CoFe2O4 additive content. The introduction of CoFe2O4 into VO2 matrix can not only lower the phase transition temperature, but also optimize the luminous transmittance and solar modulation ability of the VO2/CoFe2O4 nanocomposites as well. Our findings demonstrate a promising avenue in constructing VO2-based smart films with excellent thermochromic performance.

Abstract: The combination of dye or quantum dots sensitized solar cell and electrochromic device has led to the realization of the photoelectrochromic device (PECD). In this study, a PECD consisted of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) sensitized photoanode, poly(3,4-(2,2-dimethylpropylenedioxy)thiophene) (PProDOT-Me2) electrochromic film, Br-/Br3- with Li+ as electrolyte was fabricated, and it shows advantages of highly transparency for bleached state when compared with conventional photoelectrochromic device. As a PECD, it exhibits a reversible optical modulation under constant illumination (100 mW cm−2) by simply altering its circuit states between on and off. A high optical window of 54.6% with coloration time of 4.9 s, and bleaching time of 5.2 s was achieved at 580 nm. Additionally, stable switching for transmittance modulation after 400 cycles demonstrates its good cycle durability, exhibiting great potential in developing energy-saving applications.

Abstract: Dysregulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2S (UBE2S) contributes to tumor progression. However, its clinical significance and biological function in endometrial cancer (EMC) remain unclear. Here, we show that UBE2S is upregulated in EMC and exhibits oncogenic activities via activation of SOX6/β-Catenin signaling. High expression of UBE2S is significantly associated with poor prognosis in two independent cohorts consisting of a total of 773 patients with EMC. in vitro studies demonstrate that ectopic expression of UBE2S promotes cell proliferation and migration, whereas knockdown of UBE2S results in opposite phenotypes. Overexpression of UBE2S in EMC cells enhances the nuclear translocation of β-Catenin, and subsequently induces the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1. Inhibition of β-Catenin by XAV-939 markedly attenuates UBE2S-promoted cell growth. Mechanistically, UBE2S suppresses the expression of SOX6 to trigger β-Catenin signaling. Re-expression of SOX6 in UBE2S-expressing EMC cells abolishes the nuclear localization of β-Catenin. Collectively, these data suggest UBE2S may serve as a promising prognostic factor and function as an oncogene in EMC. The newly identified UBE2S/SOX6/β-Catenin axis represents a new potential therapeutic target for EMC intervention.

Abstract: Understanding the origin of thermomechanical stress in solar cells is a key factor to extend the lifetime of photovoltaic modules. However, the methods to determine the stress are very limited. With the confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy, we present a contactless method, which is able to measure through the front glass and is well-known in the field of microelectronics. One major challenge for the measurement on crystalline silicon solar cells and modules is the surface texturization of the mono crystalline solar cell, which changes the topology from a plain (100) surface to pyramids with (111) flanks and (100) valleys. We develop a procedure to cover the challenges arising from this topology, namely the inhomogeneous stress distribution on the pyramid flanks and the different crystal planes of the phonon vibrations and the photon back scattering. By studying the procedure on a reference system, we determine a factor for the conversion of a micro-Raman peak shift to stress of Σ=−(833±49)MPa/rel.cm−1. The presented measurements show that the factor holds for uniaxial stress, biaxial stress as well as the stress states occurring from the PV module production processes. We then apply the procedure to measure the stress from soldering 156 × 156 mm2 solar cells and the lamination. We obtain (− 21 ± 2) MPa for the stress in the unsoldered solar cells, which arise from the cell production steps, like metallization. After soldering, we measure (− 26 ± 3) MPa and after lamination (− 53 ± 6) MPa. Additionally we perform a line scan along the cell diagonal and area scans of the quarter cell as well as the end of one busbar. All results match well with a simulation of stress induced by the soldering process and lamination using the finite element method.

Abstract: Regulation of alternative splicing events is an essential step required for the expression of functional cytoskeleton and sarcomere proteins in cardiomyocytes. About 3% of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy cases present mutations in the RNA binding protein RBM20, a tissue specific regulator of alternative splicing. Transcripts expressed preferentially in skeletal and cardiac muscle, including TTN, CAMK2D, LDB3, LMO7, PDLIM3, RTN4, and RYR2, are RBM20-dependent splice variants. In the present study, we investigated the RBM20 involvement in post-transcriptional regulation of splicing variants expressed by Formin homology 2 domain containing 3 (FHOD3) gene. FHOD3 is a sarcomeric protein highly expressed in the cardiac tissue and required for the assembly of the contractile apparatus. Recently, FHOD3 mutations have been found associated with heart diseases. We identified novel FHOD3 splicing variants differentially expressed in human tissues and provided evidences that FHOD3 transcripts are specific RBM20 and PTBP1 targets. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the expression of RBM20 and PTBP1 promoted the alternative shift, from inclusion to exclusion, of selected FHOD3 exons. These results indicate that RBM20 and PTBP1 play a role in the actin filament functional organization mediated by FHOD3 isoforms and suggest their possible involvement in heart diseases.

Abstract: Soiling of Photovoltaic (PV) modules is a growing area of concern due to the adverse effect of dust accumulation on PV performance and reliability. In this work, we report on four fundamental adhesion forces that take place at the first stage of soiling process. These are capillary, van der Waal, electrostatic and gravitational forces. It is found that under high relative humidity, the adhesion mechanism between dust particles and PV module surfaces is dominated by capillary force, while van der Waal force dominates under dry conditions. Moreover, real field data for long soiling periods over solar panels in Qatar were investigated and resulted in proposing a novel modified sigmoid function that predicts a relative humidity inflexion value at which transition in the particulate matter deposition rate takes place from low to high values. Moreover, the effect of surface roughness was investigated by measuring adhesion force over clean glass versus substrates that are coated with in-house developed anti-dust titania thin films.

The use semiconducting two dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) nanosheets light absorbing layer in modern solar cell is inevitable. Diverse large area synthesis tools to tailor nanosheets and its incorporation in solar cell cover the entire solar spectrum for enhanced photon management. In this review, the case to case use of TMDCs in various photovoltaic devices as an efficient absorber layer has been discussed. Experimental measures to overcome the limitations of pristine TMDC layers due to its atomic layer thickness were also reviewed. It can be seen that, the device performance of the TMDCs based solar cells is showing significant improvement in comparison with conversional silicon based photovoltaics.

Abstract: Cancer cells exhibit HR defects, increased proliferation and checkpoint aberrations. Tumour suppressor proteins, BRCA2 and p53 counteract such aberrant proliferation by checkpoint regulation. Intriguingly, chemo-resistant cancer cells, exhibiting mutated BRCA2 and p53 protein survive even with increased DNA damage accumulation. Such cancer cells show upregulation of RAD52 tumour suppressor protein implying that RAD52 might be providing survival advantage to cancer cells. To understand this paradoxical condition of a tumour suppressor protein facilitating cancer cell survival, in the current study, we investigate the role of RAD52 overexpression in BRCA2 deficient cells. We provide evidence that RAD52 protein alleviates HR inhibition imposed by p53 in BRCA2 deficient cells. In addition, we study the role of RAD52 protein during short replication stress in BRCA2 deficient cells. BRCA2 deficient cells exhibit excessive origin firing and checkpoint evasion in the presence of prevailing DNA damage. Interestingly, overexpression of RAD52 rescues the excessive origin firing and checkpoint defects observed in BRCA2 deficient cells, indicating RAD52 protein compensates for the loss of BRCA2 function. We show that RAD52 protein, just as BRCA2, interacts with pCHK1 checkpoint protein and helps maintain the checkpoint control in BRCA2 deficient cells during DNA damage response.

Abstract: Hyperandrogenism is one of the clinical and biochemical characteristics of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Our previous studies confirmed that nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1), as a differentially expressed gene in the ovaries of PCOS patients, was upregulated by increased androgen. However, the potential mechanism of NR4A1 upregulation remains unknown. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in NR4A1 regulation, we cloned and characterized the promoter regions of the NR4A1 gene using a series of truncated promoter plasmids in luciferase reporter assays. We identified two unique core promoters of NR4A1 located within the +1055/+1251 and +3183/+3233 regions relative to the transcription start site. TFAP2A downregulated NR4A1 expression, while five ETS transcription factors, ETS1, ELK1, ERG, FLI1 and SPI1, could upregulate NR4A1 promoter activity in HeLa cells. Of these transcription factors, ETS1 and ELK1 were the most effective ones. Moreover, all six transcription factors were confirmed to interact directly with the NR4A1 promoter. In conclusion, this study presents the first description that TFAP2A and ETS family signaling networks are involved in the androgen-mediated transcriptional regulation of NR4A1, which contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the TFAP2A-NR4A1 and ETS-NR4A1 signaling networks in PCOS.

Abstract: Five new donor-acceptor (X-DAD'AD)n type conjugated polymers have been synthesized using different X blocks based on carbazole, fluorene, silafluorene, benzodithiophene, and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT). The strongly electron donating CPDT unit was used as a central D′ fragment to enhance intramolecular charge transfer interactions along the polymer backbone and reduce the bandgap of the resulting conjugated polymers. Apparently, the nature of the X block impacts the photophysical, morphological and optoelectronic properties of the designed polymers as well as their performance in bulk heterojunction solar cells. Fluorene-based copolymer P2 in combination with [70]PCBM delivered the best power conversion efficiency of 5.0% with a VOC of 0.78 V, a JSC of 11.1 mA/cm2 and a FF of 57%. Possibility for easy variation of the X and D′ blocks in the designed materials paves a way towards design of a variety of new materials for optoelectronic applications.

Abstract: The paper deals with VO2-based thermochromic coatings prepared by reactive magnetron sputtering. We combine four ways how to improve the coating performance and to increase its application potential. First, reactive high-power impulse magnetron sputtering with a pulsed O2 flow control allowed us to prepare crystalline VO2 of the correct stoichiometry under highly industry-friendly deposition conditions: without any substrate bias at a low deposition temperature of 330 °C. Second, doping of VO2 by W (leading to V1-xWxO2, with x = 0.012 in this work) allowed us to shift the thermochromic transition temperature towards the room temperature (39 °C in this work), without concessions in terms of coating properties. Third, we employ ZrO2 antireflection layers both below and above the thermochromic V1-xWxO2 layer, and present an optimum design of the resulting ZrO2/V1-xWxO2/ZrO2 coatings. Most importantly, we show that while utilizing a first-order interference on ZrO2 leads one to a tradeoff between the luminous transmittance (Tlum) and the modulation of the solar transmittance (ΔTsol), utilizing a second-order interference allows one to optimize both Tlum and ΔTsol in parallel. Fourth, the crystalline structure of the bottom ZrO2 layer further improves the VO2 crystallinity and the process reproducibility. The optimum experimental values of ZrO2 thickness are in agreement with those predicted during the coating design. The results are important for the design and low-temperature fabrication of high-performance durable thermochromic VO2-based coatings for smart window applications.

Abstract: High capital expenditures associated with manufacturing thin silicon wafers make it difficult for the industry to scale up and prevent novel technologies from entering the market. Thin wafers fail largely due to breakage during solar cell processing and handling. One of the root causes for breakage is sub-mm edge cracks in the silicon wafer, and these cracks cannot be reliably detected by most commercially-available crack detection tools. In this work, we first investigate the correlation between wafer thickness and critical crack length, and explain the importance of detecting sub-500-μm edge cracks as the wafer thickness is reduced. Secondly, we extend our previous work of micro-crack detection to demonstrate an edge illumination technique using a near-infrared laser to image edge cracks less than 500 μm in length in multicrystalline silicon. Thirdly, we investigate two fundamental edge illumination mechanisms based on dark-field imaging; namely, direct and vicinal illumination. We will then compare these methods to a state-of-the-art rear illumination method. The advantages and disadvantages of both illumination methods are presented and provide an in-depth analysis of light-crack interaction. In particular, we find that the robustness of vicinal illumination is due to diffuse reflectance. The diffuse reflectance has less dependence on crack configurations, while direct illumination has more dependence on the crack configurations because it utilizes specular reflectance. Our results show that our proposed prototype can detect sub-mm edge cracks in multicrystalline silicon wafers, which is an important step in enabling thin silicon wafer manufacturing.

Abstract: Background: Bioactive peptides existing in vivo have been considered as an important class of natural medicines for the treatment of diseases. Peptidome analysis of tissues and biofluids had provided important information about the differentially expressed bioactive peptides in vivo. Methods: Here, we analyzed the peptidome of serous ovarian cancer tissue samples and normal ovarian epithelial tissue samples by mass spectrometry and further investigated the possible bioactive peptides that were differentially expressed. Results: We identified 634 differentially expressed peptides, 508 of these peptides were highly abundant in serous ovarian cancer tissues, a result consistent with higher protease activity in ovarian cancer patients. The difference in preferred cleavage sites between the serous ovarian cancer tissues and normal ovarian epithelium indicated the characteristic peptidome of ovarian cancer and the nature of cancer-associated protease activity. Interestingly, KEGG pathway analysis of the peptide precursors indicated that the differentially regulated pathways in ovarian cancer are highly consistent with the pathways discovered in other cancers. Besides, we found that a proportion of the differentially expressed peptides are similar to the known immune-regulatory peptides and anti-bacterial peptides. Then we further investigated the function of the two down-regulated peptides in ovarian cancer cells and found that peptide P1DS significantly inhibited the invasion and migration of OVCAR3 and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. Conclusions: Our results are the first to identify the differentially expressed peptides between the serous ovarian cancer tissue and the normal ovarian epithelium. Our results indicate that bioactive peptides involved in tumorigenesis are existed in vivo.

Abstract: To make the concept of building-integrated solar cells viable, the latter should possess an increased tolerance towards light incident angle and intensity that naturally change along the day, among other required properties. In this work, three solar cell technologies as candidates for building-integrated applications are compared regarding their normalized average efficiency as a function of light intensity and incident angle. The mechanisms that lead to higher efficiency independence are evidenced by comparing several cell designs for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) and perovskite solar cells (PSC). By doing so, it was found that superior efficiency independence towards tilted light is obtained for PSC with more transparent active layers due to optical path lengthening (OPL), while DSC were found to exhibit OPL in standard configuration. All cells show a fairly stable efficiency evolution when light intensity was reduced, while at lower light intensity PSC slightly outperform DSC. The almost constant relative efficiency evolution of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells is a very interesting outcome of this work and so far, efficiency evolution of such SHJ under low light intensity have not been reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge.

TNFα stimulates NO release in EA.hy926 cells by activating the CaMKKβ-AMPK-eNOS pathway,

Abstract: Previously we showed that a mild stimulation of EA.hy926 cells with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) activated mitochondrial biogenesis, probably as a mechanism preventing cell death. This was accompanied by an increased phosphorylation of eNOS and elevation of NO release. The aim of the present study was to explain the biochemical basis of this effect. Our results indicate that eNOS is the only enzyme catalysing NO generation in EA.hy926 cells, and TNFα stimulates its activity by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Inhibition of AMPK with Compound C prevents the TNFα-induced activatory phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) at Ser1177 and reduces the NO release. AMPK is activated by phosphorylation catalysed by liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta (CaMKKβ), which are phosphorylated and thereby activated in the presence of TNFα. Moreover, CaMKKβ catalyses an activatory phosphorylation of sirtuin 1, which could deacetylate and activate eNOS both directly and indirectly by an elevating the LKB1 activity. TNFα hardly increases the nuclear fraction of sirtuin 1, thus its major activity is probably attributed to the cytosolic pool. This is in line with the elevated activity of eNOS. We conclude that the increased AMPK–dependent phosphorylation of eNOS at least partially explains the stimulation of NO generation by TNFα in EA.hy926 cells.

Abstract: Perovskite solar cells with carbon back contact (C-PSC) represent a promising architecture that allows for a simplification of the manufacture process and a stabilization of the cell performances. In this work, we designed a fully printable C-PSC using a homemade mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) ink. By increasing the alumina layer thickness we show that fill factor reduces, short-circuit current increases, while open circuit voltage increases until a thickness of 1.2 μm. In order to improve performances of PSCs, we investigated a water pre-treatment before perovskite deposition. We show that water pre-treatment improves pore filling, leads to a reduction of charge recombination, and improves the conversion of PbI2 crystals into perovskite. The water pre-treatment permits to obtain an average efficiency increasing of 16% with respect to cells without water pre-treatment.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in gametogenesis and embryo development. The present study was undertaken to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and explore their functions in oocyte vitrification. Small RNA sequencing data revealed that 22 miRNAs were differentially expressed in vitrified oocytes compared with that of the fresh counterparts. The potential target genes for the differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched in “anatomical development” in biological process, “cell” in cellular components, and “protein binding” in molecular functions by gene ontology annotation analysis. In addition, “endometrial cancer” and “metabolic pathway” were the two pathways enriched in KEGG with the lowest p-value and highest count number genes, respectively. RT-qPCR data showed that miR-134-5p, miR-210-5p, and miR-21-3p were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.01), whereas miR-465c-5p was dramatically down-regulated (P < 0.01) in vitrified oocytes, which were consistent with that of the sequencing result. Moreover, the expression of potential target PTEN was significantly reduced both at transcriptional (P < 0.01) and post-transcriptional level (P < 0.01) in vitrified oocytes. The expression pattern of PTEN was negatively correlated with that of miR-21-3p. Dual-luciferase reporter assay further demonstrated that miR-21-3p could down-regulate PTEN by targeting its 3′UTR. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that specific miRNAs were differentially expressed in warmed oocytes, and decreased expression of PTEN was involved in response to vitrification stress.

Abstract: Radiative cooling is a natural phenomenon in which earthbound objects emit energy into outer space through thermal radiation. Emitters should have high spectral reflectivity in the solar radiation band and high spectral absorptivity (emissivity) in the infrared band, especially the atmospheric window band (i.e., 0.3–3 and 8–13 µm), to efficiently utilize radiative cooling. In this work, we proposed two types of surfaces to achieve such spectral properties based on the analysis of selective and broadband radiator cooling performance. One type is a specular surface made by ultra-white glass-plated silver (Ag). The other type is a diffuse surface made by spraying zinc phosphate sodium (NaZnPO4) particles on aluminum (Al) substrate. Sample tests showed that both surfaces can effectively reflect sunlight and strongly exchange heat with outer space via thermal radiation. A radiative cooling apparatus with simple structure was built, and the equilibrium temperatures of the surfaces were tested. Both surfaces achieved consecutive 24 h sub-ambient radiative cooling effect. The equilibrium temperatures of the specular and diffuse surfaces at nighttime were lower than those of ambient air by approximately 9.8 °C and 7.3 °C, respectively. When solar irradiance exceeded 430 W m−2 at noontime, the two surfaces reached equilibrium temperatures of 2.5 °C and 1.5 °C lower than those of the surroundings. Both surfaces showed daytime radiative cooling characteristics and were superior to existing radiative coolers in terms of cost and fabrication.

Abstract: This study assessed the behaviour of a constructive material in CSP plants, namely ferritic-martensitic steel, with molten NaNO3/KNO3 (60/40 wt%), also known as Solar Salt. To this end, EIS is presented as a suitable technique to evaluate and monitor the resistance of this material to Solar Salt at 580 °C. Tests were performed up to 1000 h and results were also supported by gravimetric and microstructural characterisation of the samples and chemical analysis of the salt. According to the EIS results, a diffusion-controlled reaction occurred during contact, which indicates that the corrosion process follows a porous layer mechanism. The results also indicated variations in corrosion layer thickness and instability of the salt during the whole test. The EIS results were also used for determining the corrosion rate, this being estimated at ~300 µm year−1. Results obtained by EIS were in line with the behaviour of P91 steel as measured by gravimetric, morphological and chemical analysis. Thus, the results confirm the suitability of EIS for monitoring corrosion processes in real-time of constructive materials in CSP plants.

Abstract: In this study, novel shape-stabilized phase change materials (SSPCMs) were first prepared via melt blending by employing bio-based poly (lactic acid) (PLA) as the supporting matrix and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as the phase change working substance for thermal energy storage (TES) applications. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated that no chemical reaction occurred between PLA and HDPE during melt processing, but the crystalline regions of HDPE was decreased by the introduction of PLA component. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and shape stability tests showed that the PLA50/50HDPE blend with co-continuous phase morphology had good shape stability and thermal energy storage capacity. The co-continuous structure of un-melted PLA component in the PLA50/50HDPE blend could provide strong support for the HDPE component and maintain its shape during the phase change process. The latent heat for the PLA50/50HDPE blend during melting and freezing process are 100.1 J/g and 97.6 J/g, respectively, and the relative enthalpy efficiency reaches as high as 104.2%. After 10 thermal cycles, the thermal parameters of PLA50/50HDPE blend remain nearly constant. It indicated that the PLA50/50HDPE blend as SSPCM had excellent reusability and thermal reliability. The simple thermal energy storage and conversion experiments showed that the PLA50/50HDPE SSPCM owns great potential in solar energy storage or industrial waste heat recovery field.

Abstract: Analysis of damage to passivation contact in heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) solar cells by indium tin oxide (ITO) sputtering under various plasma excitation modes such as radio frequency (RF), direct current (DC), RF-superimposed DC, pulsed DC is presented. A significant degradation of effective minority carrier lifetime of the precursor cells at both low and high-level injections after the ITO deposition by sputtering technique was observed regardless of plasma excitation modes. We found that the main reason for this degradation was mainly due to the ion flux in the sputtering plasma rather than the ion kinetic energy. On the basis of the experimental and simulated results, we attributed the degradation of surface passivation quality mainly to the damage of the amorphous-silicon/crystalline-silicon interfaces rather than that of the intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers. This degradation could be significantly reduced by the ITO deposition at a high temperature in which a trade-off between degradation and curing step was expected to occur. The cell performance of the HIT solar cells using the ITO films deposited by various plasma excitation modes at 180 °C was subsequently discussed. The ITO films deposited by the RF-superimposed DC mode exhibited a high potential as excellent opto-electrical properties and free sputter-induced damage electrodes for HIT solar cell applications. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the ITO films deposited by the RF-superimpose DC mode are used as electrodes in the HIT solar cells.

Abstract: Herein, novel BiOCl-Bi24O31Cl10/rGO heterostructured nanocomposites with various contents of rGO were designed through a simple sono-solvothermal method, employing in the photo-elimination of fluoroquinolone antibiotics under the simulated solar-light. Their properties were described using various analyses such as XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FESEM, HRTEM, surface particle size distribution, BET-BJH, DRS and photoluminescence analyses. The results revealed the suitable dispersion of BiOCl-Bi24O31Cl10 nanoparticles on the rGO nanosheets and the creation Bi-C bonds in BiOCl-Bi24O31Cl10/rGO. On the basis of experimental outcomes, it was concluded the strong influence of the rGO value into BiOCl-Bi24O31Cl10/rGO structure on the fluoroquinolone photo-degradation and the high photo-activity was obtained on the BiOCl-Bi24O31Cl10/rGO(0.5%) with the elimination rate constant 1.6 times contrasting to the bare BiOCl-Bi24O31Cl10 in the ofloxacin photo-removal. This consequence was devoted the decrease of band gap and the enhanced light absorption features which can lead to enhancing production of electron-hole pairs, the raising separation and transmission of charge carriers and reducing recombination rate of them, the increasing surface adsorption of contaminant molecules and the increment of accessible active sites. Besides, the synthesized BiOCl-Bi24O31Cl10/rGO(0.5%) was exposed the great stability.

Abstract: Passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC) on p-type Cz Si wafers are currently being migrated to mainstream production, applying the ongoing improvements in recent years. For PERC solar cells, the emitter recombination loss becomes the main loss of the entire cell. Currently, two-step diffusion consisting of low temperature phosphosilicate glass (PSG) deposition and high-temperature drive-in has been widely applied in production and can reduce saturation current density (J0) of the emitter in the passivated area. However, a low contact resistance under metal area cannot be guaranteed. Meanwhile, the determination of the saturation current density J0 in the passivated area is dependent on the injection density during the measurement, and exact calculation of J0,metal is not as convenient as J0,diffusion, which could lead to a wrong assessment in cell analysis. In this study, a three-step diffusion (low-temperature PSG deposition–high-temperature drive-in–low temperature PSG deposition) with low J0 and low Ag-Si contact resistance is investigated and combined with a selective emitter by an etch-back process. The results are compared with a conventional two-step POCl3 diffusion. The accuracy of J0 measurement and J0,metal test method is also discussed. With these improvements, the champion cell efficiency of our PERC solar cells fabricated on 156 × 156 mm2 wafers using screen printing technology and industrial-type process has reached 22.61% with Voc of 684.4 mV and a fill factor of 81.49%, as confirmed by Fraunhofer ISE CalLab PV cells. By implementing the diffusion process to mass production, the average cell-efficiency gain is approximately 0.2% with a median efficiency of 21.7%.

Abstract: Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on fullerene acceptors demonstrated significant growth over the past two decades with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) exceeding 13%. However, the advent of non-fullerene (NF) acceptors with superior optoelectronic properties, tunable morphology, and absorption characteristics, have resulted in a scenario where the NF OSCs have demonstrated higher PCE of over 14% in single junction and over 17% in tandem OSCs incorporating NF OSCs which is relatively higher than conventional fullerene-based counterparts. In this review, recent progress and advancements made in the field of NF OSCs is discussed and its photovoltaic device performance ranging across several donor: acceptor (D/A) combinations is elaborated. The advantages of each NF materials in conjunction with the donor molecules is deliberated in the context of D/A blends correlating it to device performance. In addition, the challenges in the development and application of NF OSCs are also discussed, providing an overview for future developments.

Abstract: High temperature phase change materials (PCMs) are drawing increasing attentions globally due to their high latent heat storage ability for solar thermal energy. Encapsulation of PCMs is an effective method for preventing the leakage of liquid PCM during heat storage, which makes PCMs easier to handle. In this paper, the synthesis of microencapsulated PCM (MEPCM) with Al-25 wt% Si core (spheres, average diameter 36 µm) and Al2O3@Cu multilayered shell is reported, which works at temperature up to 500 °C. The homogeneous and effective composite shell is synthesized in multi-steps: First, a boehmite (AlOOH) shell is formed by boiling treatment in water, which is then transferred to Al2O3 shell by heating at 500 °C. Second, the Al2O3 covered particles are etched with HCl solution. Third, electroless plating of Cu layer is carried out to form the multilayered MEPCM. The surface morphology, cross-sectional structure, and thermal durability and stability of the MEPCM are investigated. The core/shell Al-25 wt%Si@Al2O3@Cu particles can maintain their integrity even after 100 melting–solidification cycles with a low breakage ratio of about 1.7%. The results indicate that as-prepared MEPCM can be used for high temperature thermal energy storage such as solar thermal power generation. The success of Cu plating on spherical particles can also be applied to fabricate other Cu coated PCMs due to expected high thermal conductivity of Cu, especially for the low temperature ones such as organic PCMs.

Abstract: Carrier-selective contacts based on silicon films deposited onto a thin SiOx layer combine high performance with a degree of compatibility with industrial solar cell metallization steps. This paper demonstrates an approach to form electron-selective passivating contacts that maximises the overlap with common industrial equipment; it is based on depositing an intrinsic amorphous silicon (a-Si) layer by PECVD and then doping and re-crystallizing it by means of a thermal phosphorus diffusion. By optimizing the intrinsic a-Si thickness and the phosphorus diffusion temperature, a low recombination current density Joc ≈ 3 fA/cm2 and a low contact resistivity of ρc ≈ 3 mΩ-cm2 have been achieved. Additionally, these electrical parameters have been found to be sensitive to the work function of the outer metal electrode. The application of these optimized electron-selective passivating contacts to n-type silicon solar cells has permitted to achieve a conversion efficiency of 24.7%. A loss analysis has been conducted through Quokka 2 simulations, which together with quantum efficiency measurements, indicate that further optimization should focus on the front boron-doped region of the device.

Abstract: Objective/Background
The Oncotype Dx test is a genomic test currently used in clinical practice to predict the risk of disease recurrence in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node-negative or micrometastatic disease. The test is one of several similar genomically based tests available. Although it has a good predictive value, it is expensive and thus constitutes a significant financial burden for health systems. Thus, several attempts have been made to devise low-cost tools that could predict the recurrence score derived from the genomic evaluation using easily obtainable clinical parameters.
Methods
Two previously proposed predictive tools were evaluated in a cohort of 201 patients that had undergone the Oncotype Dx test for their efficacy in predicting the Oncotype Dx Recurrence Score (RS). A simple predictor, named GR-PR, based on two available pathologic parameters, grade and progesterone receptor status was devised and also evaluated.
Results
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of all three tools were compared and found to be similar for all cutoff points of Oncotype Dx RS. The accuracy of GR-PR was comparable to the best performing of the two other prediction tools for all four cutoff points.
Conclusion
The simple GR-PR predictor proposed in this study seems to be at least as accurate as more complex tools and should be the preferred tool for the prediction of Oncotype Dx RS from clinicopathologic parameters when the Oncotype Dx test is not available.

Abstract: The acquisition of resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remains a critical problem in lung cancer clinic, but the underlying mechanisms have remained incompletely understood. Although the TKI-induced or –selected genetic changes are known to drive resistance, resistance also occurs in tumor cells without genetic changes through poorly-characterized processes. Here, we show that the extracellular matrix (ECM) from various components of the tumor microenvironment, including neighboring tumor cells and fibroblasts, may be the driver of resistance in the absence of genetic changes. Unlike genetic changes, which may evolve during relatively long time of chronic EGFR TKI treatment to drive resistance, briefly culturing on de-cellularized ECM, or co-culturing with the ECM donor cells, immediately confers resistance to tumor cells that are otherwise sensitive to EGFR TKIs. We show evidence that collagen in the ECM may be its primary constituent driving resistance, at least partly through the collagen receptor Integrin-β1. Intriguingly, such effect of ECM and collagen is dose-dependent and reversible, suggesting a potential clinic-relevant application for targeting this effect. Collectively, our results reveal that the stromal ECM acts as a microenvironmental cue promoting EGFR TKI resistance in lung cancer cells, and targeting collagen and Integrin-β1 may be useful for treating resistance, especially the resistance without clearly-defined genetic changes, for which effective therapeutics are lacking.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to prepare an Al/Al2O3 core–shell microencapsulated phase-change material (MEPCM) for a high-temperature thermal energy storage (TES) system. Al (melting temperature: 660 °C) was selected as a raw material for use as a phase change material (PCM). The MEPCM was prepared in two steps: (1) the formation of an AlOOH precursor shell on the PCM microspheres via boehmite treatment in boiled distilled water and (2) heat oxidation treatment in an O2 atmosphere to form a stable Al2O3 shell. The effects of the heat oxidation temperature on the shell morphology, shell structure, heat capacity, and cyclic durability of the prepared MEPCMs were examined. The resultant MEPCM was a core–shell-type structure composed of a stable α-Al2O3 shell and an Al core. The melting temperature of the MEPCMs was close to that of pure Al, and small supercooling of approximately 10 K was observed. Although the increase of the heat oxidation temperature reduced the heat-storage capacity of the MEPCMs (273–301 J g−1) as larger amounts of Al were consumed to form α-Al2O3, the repetition durability of the developed specimens was improved by increasing the heat-treatment temperature. In conclusion, the Al-based MEPCM is a potential candidate for high-temperature TES applications owing to its high melting temperature, high thermal storage capacity, and small degree of supercooling.

Abstract: Antireflection (AR) coatings on solar glass, used in photovoltaic (PV) modules, generally encounter harsh environments, which demands that AR coatings must hinder moisture penetration, scratch damage, and dust accumulation. Though chemical modification generally benefits the multi-functionalization of AR coatings, it is likely to bring about a degradation of optical and mechanical properties. We demonstrated that a well-controlled dual precursor modification/hybridization process of hollow silica nanospheres was the key to achieve the robust multifunctional AR coatings. The dual precursor-derived AR coatings exhibited an increase of 5.08% in average transmittance at wavelengths from 300 to 1200 nm and a small relative reduction below 0.6% after an ultra-long highly-accelerated humidity and temperature stress test duration of 120 h, equivalent to a 5000 h damp heat test at a temperature and a relative humidity of 85 °C and 85%, respectively, as well as the excellent abrasion and dust resistance. The effects of the dual precursor-derived AR coatings on PV devices were evaluated by the encapsulated crystalline silicon mini-modules, where the improvements of 2.45% and 3.20% in the short-circuit current and the power conversion efficiency (Jsc and PCE) on average, respectively, relative to the bare glass encapsulated mini-modules were observed; meanwhile, the dust resistance of the AR coatings brought about the less degradations of 1.01% and 1.15% in Jsc and PCE, respectively, after the dust settling and removal tests, while the mini-modules with bare glass were 3.45% and 4.40%. It was believed that the dual-precursor, potentially, multi-precursor protocols would pave the way towards developing mechanically robust AR coatings with various fascinating functionalities, such as anti-fingerprint, anti-soiling, anti-fogging, and anti-icing.

Abstract: S. cerevisiae ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus hosts a series of highly complex regulatory machineries for RNA polymerase I, II and III transcription, DNA replication and units recombination, all acting in the Non Transcribed Spacers (NTSs) interposed between the repeated units by which it is composed. DNA topoisomerase I (Top1p) contributes, recruiting Sir2p, to the maintenance of transcriptional silencing occurring at the RNA Polymerase II cryptic promoters, located in the NTS region. In this paper we found that Fob1p presence is crucial for Top1p recruitment at NTS, allowing transcriptional silencing to be established and maintained. We also showed the role of Nsr1p in Top1p recruitment to rDNA locus. Our work allows to hypothesize that Nsr1p targets Top1p into the nucleolus while Fob1p is responsible for its preferential distribution at RFB.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown a highly efficient performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) of 22.7%. Although a number of efforts have been made to reproduce flat, uniform, and dense perovskite films using a stoichiometric ratio of 'CH3NH3I: PbI2: DMSO = 1:1:1′, several complicated processes are required to achieve a regular grain-to-grain uniformity. Therefore, it was difficult to reproduce. This is because the conventional ratio of 'CH3NH3I: PbI2: DMSO = 1:1:1′ can cause the CH3NH3I-PbI2-DMSO intermediate phase and the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal phase to coexist in solution. As a result, the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals in the solution may deteriorate the quality of the thin film. In this study, the non-stoichiometric molar ratio among CH3NH3I:PbI2:DMSO solutions was applied to control the quality of the perovskite layers. We successfully fabricated uniform and dense CH3NH3PbI3 PSCs, by simply manipulating CH3NH3PbI3 solubility with the different DMSO molar amounts. Further, a homogeneous grain size and a regular inter-grain arrangement with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were obtained in the optimized solubility. We also confirmed that the PSCs with the optimized condition exhibited higher Jsc (Current density) and PCE (Power Conversion Efficiency), due to the Lamer model effect on the enhancement of the internal light absorption. Furthermore, the device with the optimized solubility exhibited enhanced electrical properties. Especially, the improved-electrical properties of the charge carrier-separation, mobility, collection, generation, and resistances were confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) quenching/mapping of the space-charge limited current (SCLC), the photo current density as a function of internal voltage (Jph–Vint) characteristic, and the impedance. Consequently, it was shown that tailoring the solubility of CH3NH3PbI3 can have a critical effect on the production of high quality perovskite thin films. These films will have an appropriate particle size and uniformity that will have a promising approach for generating high current densities.

Abstract: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is one of the most common fatal carcinomas and is well known to be lack of effective treatment. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are greatly needed. Evodiamine, a quinozole alkaloid isolated from evodia rutaecarpa Bentham, has been demonstrated to exhibit anti-tumor effects on many cancer cells. However, little is known in terms of the effects on cholangiocarcinoma. In this study, we studied whether this traditional Chinese Medicine could serve as new potential therapeutic drugs to treat CCA. We discovered that evodiamine inhibited CCA cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Moreover, evodiamine inhibited CCA cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, our studies demonstrated that evodiamine inhibited the activation of IL-6 -induced STAT3 signaling activation, and the inhibitory effect was likely due to the upregulation of phosphatase shatterproof 2 (SHP-2), a negative feedback regulator of IL-6/STAT3. Blockage of SHP-2 through small interference RNA (siRNA) abolished the evodiamine -induced IL-6/STAT3 signaling inhibition. Moreover, in vivo experiment showed evodiamine inhibited the tumor growth of nude mice bearing TFK-1 xenografts. In summary, our results implied evodiamine as a promising anti-cancer agent in the treatment of CCA, and the mechanism is likely due to the inhibition of IL-6/STAT3 signaling with upregulating the expression levels of SHP-2.

Abstract: Hollow rice grain-shaped titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanostructures (NSs) with the radius of 200–300 nm are fabricated by electrospinning titanium isopropoxide solution and further calcination. The resulting hollow rice grain-shaped TiO2 NSs are highly porous, which are beneficial to the infiltration of perovskites and provide a large contact area, as the building blocks to construct the mesoporous TiO2 layer for the large-area (the active area is 1 cm2) CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). By varying the spin coating speed (2000 rpm, 4000 rpm, and 8000 rpm, respectively), the performance of PSCs changes with different TiO2 NSs distribution densities. The optimized PSC employing the 4000 rpm spin coating speed exhibits a photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.2% with the short circuit current density (JSC) of 21.6 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.07 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.61, which is superior to the plain structure based control group with the PCE of 9.6%. Furthermore, the PSC possesses a reproducible PCE value with weak hysteresis in its current density-voltage (J-V) curves. Moreover, photoluminescence (PL) measurements and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical simulations reveal the enhanced fast charge carrier extraction/transport and light absorption in the proposed system, which makes electrospun hollow rice grain-shaped TiO2 NSs a promising electron transportation material for high-efficiency and large-area photovoltaic devices.

Abstract: We demonstrate solar cell devices grown on 50 mm diameter GaAs substrates by dynamic hydride vapor phase epitaxy (D-HVPE). In contrast to our prior D-HVPE devices, grown at 650 °C in a transport-limited regime, these devices were grown at 700 °C in a kinetically-limited growth regime in which the growth rate uniformity is controlled by thermally-activated surface reactions. These devices exhibit open-circuit voltages up to 1.07 V, nearly identical performance to the devices grown at lower temperature in a different growth regime. We evaluate the uniformity of device performance and find only a 1% variation in absolute, device efficiency across the majority of the wafer in devices without anti-reflection coating. We analyze the GaAs and GaInP thickness uniformity and GaInP compositional uniformity, using high-tresolution x-ray diffraction mapping, and find that any non-uniformity in device efficiency is not related to variations in these structural parameters. We combine three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics modeling of our reactor with a kinetic model for GaAs growth, and use the combined model to predict spatial GaAs growth rate over a 50 mm wafer area. We compare these predictions with experimental data from our D-HVPE reactor and find excellent agreement. We use the model to the gain insight into the specific mechanisms that control GaAs spatial uniformity in the kinetically-limitedgrowth regime. These results suggest a large parameter window for the growth of high-performance optoelectronic devices by D-HVPE, possibly with large area uniformity.

Abstract: In this work we develop a rear emitter silicon solar cell integrating carrier-selective passivating contacts (CSPCs) with different thermal budget in the same device. The solar cell consists of a B-doped poly-Si/SiOx hole collector and an i/n hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) stack acting as electron collector placed on the planar rear and textured front side, respectively. We investigate the passivation properties of both CSPCs on symmetric structures by optimizing the interdependency among annealing temperature, time and environment. The optimized B-doped poly-Si/SiOx reaches a saturation current density of ~10 fA/cm2 on n-type wafers and an implied open circuit voltage (iVOC) of 716 mV. Furthermore, the i/n a-Si:H stack shows an effective carrier lifetime above 4 ms and iVOC of ~705 mV for cell-relevant layers thickness. After a post-deposition annealing in H2, lifetime is above 10 ms and iVOC = 708 mV. Finally, we optimize the optoelectronic properties of indium-based transparent conductive oxide (Indium Tin Oxide ITO and hydrogenated indium oxide IO:H) to reduce parasitic absorption with a gain in short circuit current density of 0.23 mA/cm2. In conclusion, the optimized layer stacks are implemented at device level obtaining a device with VOC = 704 mV, fill factor of 73.8%, a short circuit current of 39.7 mA/cm2 and 21.0% aperture-area conversion efficiency.

Abstract: Organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells emerge as a breakthrough photovoltaic technology with high power conversion efficiency. However, some inherent shortcomings impede their further industrialization: 1) the toxicity of Pb, 2) unstable, sensitive to moisture and/or light. To circumvent these issues, we study the lead-free and solution-processed photovoltaic devices based on the double-metals <111>-oriented 2D layered formamidinium germanium-antimony halide perovskites (FA4GeIISbIIICl12) in this contribution. Compared with benchmark MAPbI3, the larger formamidinium is selected to replace methylammonium to form a more stable crystal structure while the double metals germanium-antimony (GeII-SbIII) are chosen to replace Pb under the considerations that expanding the possible metal combinations in the design of new perovskite with analogous photovoltaic performance. The FA4GeIISbIIICl12 perovskite behaves as a stable and efficient semiconductor with direct bandgap of ~ 1.3 eV and its conductivity is one order of magnitude higher than that of MAPbI3. Meanwhile, FA4GeIISbIIICl12 based solar cell with power conversion efficiency up to 4.7% can be achieved without use of any additives. This approach opens up new possibilities of exploiting lead-free perovskite that incorporates metals in different valence states and offers great potential application in photoelectric field.

Abstract: Background
Invasion and metastasis of synovial sarcoma is the leading cause of death in patients. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) accelerates tumor cell invasion and metastasis. MiR-9 promotes tumor metastasis by inducing EMT. However, the role of miR-9 in synovial sarcoma is still not clear.
Methods
Overexpression or knockdown of miR-9 in human synovial sarcoma (HSS) cell lines was carried out by miR-9 mimics or miR-9 inhibitors transfection. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were detected using MTS and colony formation assays, flow cytometry, wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was applied to study the interaction between miR-9 and CDH1. Nude mice xenograft model was established, and immunohistochemistry staining assessed Ki-67 level. The related mRNA and protein expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting.
Results
The bioinformatics analyses and luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-9 can target CDH1 3′-UTR. Moreover, miR-9 could induce EMT of HSS cells via targeting CDH1. The negative regulation of miR-9 on CDH1 expression was also confirmed in a mouse xenograft model of synovial sarcoma. Furthermore, miR-9 was observed to induce HSS cell proliferation, migration and invasion and inhibit apoptosis. MAPK/ERK and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathways were activated by the miR-9 overexpression in HSS cells, and then further enhancing tumorigenesis of HSS, which was further confirmed in the mouse model.
Conclusion
MiR-9 induces EMT by targeting CDH1, and activates MAPK/ERK and Wnt/β-catenin signal pathways, thus promoting HSS tumorigenesis.

Abstract: In the current study, a numerical modelling for the thermal performance of a solar collector is improved. In order to enhance the heat transfer rate, three types of nanofluids, including copper oxide, aluminum oxide and carbon nanotubes are studied where the base fluid is the water. Thermal performance and temperature distribution in the solar collector pipelines are investigated by changing nanoparticles and their volumetric concentration. The applied volumetric fractions are 1%, 3%, 5%, 7% and 10%. Results indicate that the thermal performance of the absorbing pipe is improved compared to the pure water. Furthermore, carbon nanotubes show a better heat transfer behavior compared to other nanoparticles. For volumetric fractions less than 5%, the system shows better efficiency compared with higher volumetric fractions.

Abstract: Further increasing the conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells by advanced solar cell concepts like SHJ (Silicon Hetero-Junction), PERT (Passivated Emitter Rear Totally diffused), IBC (Interdigitated Back-Contact), requires a highly controlled silicon surface in terms of metal impurity density. The goal of this study is investigating the deposition property of different metals in acidic cleaning solutions and consequently determining the impact of these impurities on the effective minority lifetime of the crystalline silicon solar cell material. The deposition behaviour of impurities is mathematically described with an adsorption isotherm theory. Once attached at the silicon surface, the metal impurity can diffuse into the silicon bulk material during a high temperature process step like diffusion, passivation or contact annealing (firing). First, we have studied the adsorption isotherm behaviour of prominent metal impurities (Fe, Cu, Ti, Co, Cr and Zn) in acidic liquid onto a silicon surface. Moreover, the impact of metal impurities on effective minority carrier lifetime in commercially available n-type Cz-silicon (3–5 Ω cm, 239 cm2) is determined. From controlled contamination experiments we can extract an exchange volume, that provides the minimum amount on wet chemical cleaning solution that is required to clean a silicon surface from a given high metal impurity level to a specified low metal impurity level. This exchange volume plays a crucial role by defining feed and bleed recipes on wet chemical cleaning tanks in solar cell manufacturing. A second parameter extracted is the effective minority carrier lifetime degradation of the metal impurities. After deposition on the surface, the impurities are driven into the silicon bulk by high temperature processes. Depending on the lifetime degradation capacity, a relation of effective minority carrier lifetime versus surface contamination level could be identified for each metal impurity. We found Co, Fe and Cu having a strong impact on effective minority carrier lifetime degradation, e.g. 2e10/cm2 Fe surface concentration can reduce the effective minority carrier lifetime by 75%, while Ti, Zn and Cr are more moderate and only high surface concentrations above 1e12/cm2 lead to effective minority carrier lifetime degradation of more than 20% compared to the non-contaminated wafers.

Abstract: Improvement of solar cell performance through the parallel homo-tandem architecture is studied. The cell geometry is optically designed to maximize absorption of the AM1.5 spectrum. We consider both ITO electrode and a recently devised ITO-free alternative, the Two-Resonance Tapping Cavity. The optimal geometry strongly depends on this choice. We identify two mechanisms by which tandem cells outperform single cells: (i) back-up absorption and (ii) interferometric gain mediated by the central metallic electrode. We numerically demonstrate large improvement in short-circuit current for a wide choice of realistic materials: PTB7-th:PC71BM, P3HT:PC61BM, DBP:C70, and methylammonium lead halide perovskite, as well as a theoretical material with a Shockley-Queiser type of spectral absorption plus an Urbach tail. Such an idealized response is found to reliably model real materials. A general response pattern is found that fits all the cases covered in our study, and which can serve as a guide to optimize homo-tandem cells.

Abstract: The expression and levels of secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), important Wnt signalling antagonists, have been reported to be reduced in various cancers, and are associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. During tumour development, all sFRP (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) genes are hypermethylated, causing transcriptional silencing. sFRPs have an ability to sensitize tumour cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, enhancing cell death. Reduced Wnt signalling is associated with loss of cancer stem cell (CSC) viability. We investigated the possible involvement of methylation-mediated silencing of the sFRP gene family in CSCs derived from breast, prostate, and ovarian tumour cell lines. Real-time RT-PCR studies indicated that loss or downregulation of sFRP (1-5) expression in tumours is associated with promoter hypermethylation. Additionally, CSCs derived from all tumour cell lines with sFRP (1-5) promotor hypermethylation expressed sFRP (1-5) mRNA after treatment with 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza), especially sFRP4, implying that DNA methylation is the predominant epigenetic mechanism for sFRP (1-5) silencing. Furthermore, post-translational modification (PTM) in total and histone proteins was observed post 5-Aza and sFRP4 treatment. Protein levels of Wnt downstream signalling components (GSK3β, active β-catenin, and phospho β-catenin) and epigenetic factors of histones (acetyl histone H3, and H3K27me3) affecting PTM were analysed. Our findings suggest that downregulation of sFRP4 expression in endocrine-related cancers can be attributed to aberrant promoter hypermethylation in conjugation with histone modification, and indicate the important role of methylation-induced gene silencing of sFRP4 in survival and proliferation of CSCs derived from these cancers.

Abstract: The energy of ions during plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is known to impact material quality, but isolating this effect from other process parameters (plasma density, pressure) in a capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) is not straightforward. In this work, we utilize a novel radio-frequency (RF) excitation technique – tailored voltage waveforms (TVW) – as a solution to achieve ion flux-energy decoupling through the electrical asymmetry effect. This makes it possible to independently study the impact of ion energy on material deposition. We study the impact of ion energy - more precisely the maximum ion bombardment energy (IBEmax) before collisions - on the PECVD of hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (µc-Si:H) thin films from an SiF4/H2/Ar chemistry. Through structural and electronic analysis, we find that the variation of IBEmax directly translates into material quality, even at relatively high process pressure. Better material properties (crystalline grain features, material density and photoelectronic response) are obtained for films deposited with moderate values of IBEmax around 45–55 eV. Above this range, a deterioration in material quality is observed, presumably due to more effective bulk atomic displacements induced by the silicon-containing ions. These results are consistent with the performance of single-junction µc-Si:H solar cell devices using these materials as active layers. Optimum performance is obtained for devices with an absorber layer deposited using a plasma excitation resulting in IBEmax in the range of ~45–55 eV. The variation in device performance is mainly due to changes in the open circuit voltage.

Abstract: The outdoor dependence of module orientation and diurnal climatic conditions on the performance of Organic Photovoltaics (OPVs) configured for Building Integrated PV (BIPV) arrays is reported. The study focuses upon a Northern European climate and the significance of module orientation upon energy yield across diurnal, seasonal change and climatic conditions are discussed. It is shown that the optimum position of a BIPV facade depends upon season and that a south facing BIPV facade provides the greatest energy yield during winter months. The results also show how west-facing modules can significantly contribute to power generation during peak power periods (5–8 p.m.), which is imperative for balancing energy demand for buildings of the future and in particular supply the energy needs of buildings during peak hours in Northern Europe. Electrical characteristics under standard and part-load conditions were collated from laboratory scale OPV module experimental data and scaled for commercial-size modules in order to simulate BIPV arrays based upon OPVs. The simulated data is compared to experimental data and the closeness shows that BIPV systems based upon OPVs can be accurately simulated prior to installation. The system simulations compare typical energy demand profiles of small commercial buildings and illustrate that OPV arrays show strong potential to be used with excess energy generation for 8 months of the year based upon a 4.22kWp OPV system. Four 4.22kWp OPV systems scenarios have been investigated for (1) the highest annual energy generation, (2) architecturally evenly-spaced around the building (avoiding a North façade), (3) grid-balancing and (4) East-West split. Whilst Scenario 4 shows the lowest overall energy yield over the course of the year, energy production during peak hours is substantially higher than in other scenarios. The options presented show that OPVs are viable to use in BIPVs and can adequately meet the energy demand of a small commercial building during spring, summer and autumn in Norther Europe and can be adapted to end user's needs.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide. PDAC is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy which leads to the poor prognosis of PDAC patients and a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. Exploring the mechanism of the pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis is the key to finding a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. B7-H3 belongs to the B7 family of immunoregulatory proteins, and the overexpression of B7-H3 is found in various types of cancer. The regulation of B7-H3 expression in pancreatic cancer is still unclear. Here, we showed that B7-H3 acted as a negative prognostic biomarker in PDAC and promoted cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Next, we applied the drug screening method to identify bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) inhibitors that decreased the protein and mRNA levels of B7-H3 in pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, we verified that BRD4 was responsible for regulating the expression of B7-H3 at the transcriptional level. Finally, our data indicated that the BRD4/B7-H3 axis modulated the expression of TLR4 in pancreatic cancer cells. Taken together, our results elucidated the regulation of B7-H3 expression in pancreatic cancer and uncovered the importance of BRD4/B7-H3/TLR4 pathway. The targeting of B7-H3 by the BET inhibitors may be a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome the immunotherapy and chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer.

Abstract: An anisotropic thermal conductivity phase change composite was successfully prepared. The carbon nanotube array(CNT array) is infiltrated byRT100. The as-prepared RT100/CNT array composite is determined by SEM and XRD and the results show that the RT100 is mostly encapsulated in the pores of CNT array. The DSC measurements indicate that the melting temperature and latent heat of the composite are 87.5 °C and 195.5 J g−1, respectively. The as-prepared composite shows 51-fold thermal conductivity enhancement as compared to RT100 and anisotropic thermal conductivity. The RT100/CNT array with anisotropic thermal conductivity could be used in specific application, such as the direct solar thermal storage systems. Further, the as-prepared PCM composite shows great thermal photo-driven performance when placed under the solar simulator. Hence, the RT100/CNT array has great potential in solar thermal utilization.

Abstract: Treatment outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unsatisfactory, and effective new therapeutic methods are urgently needed. Gossypol has been shown to have an anti-HCC effect, but the underlying mechanism requires further study. In this study, we found gossypol inhibited HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Typical apoptosis was induced in HCC cells. Dilated ER and autophagosomes were observed by electron microscopy, and the activation of the unfolded protein response and autophagy markers suggested that gossypol induced both ER stress and autophagy. C/EBP homologous protein was the key factor that led to apoptotic cell death, whereas inositol-requiring enzyme 1α and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α played a protective role. Autophagy protected the cells from ER stress-related apoptosis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that inhibition of autophagy enhanced the anti-HCC effect of gossypol. Taken together, ER stress is the molecular mechanism underlying gossypol-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Gossypol exhibits anti-HCC activity primarily through the activation of apoptosis. However, gossypol-induced autophagy protects HCC cells from ER stress. Therefore, a combination therapy of gossypol and autophagy inhibitors may lead to an enhanced anti−HCC effect.

Abstract: Intensive research on lead halide perovskites over the last decade led to highly efficient perovskite thin-film photovoltaics. Further enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of this technology is expected from improved light management. In this simulation-based study, nanophotonic perovskite absorber layers are designed in order to enhance the short-circuit current density (JSC) of perovskite solar cells. The enhancement in JSC is beneficial in one of two ways. Firstly, optimized nanophotonic perovskite layers lead to an enhancement in JSC by 5–6% assuming a constant perovskite absorber volume, which correlates to a similar improvement in PCE and annual energy yield (EY). Secondly, optimized nanophotonic perovskite layers can alternatively allow a high JSC to be maintained at reduced perovskite absorber volumes. The latter approach results in about one third of the harmful lead content being mitigated in conventional perovskite solar cells, for an initial perovskite layer thickness of ~300 nm. This study evaluates and analyzes in detail the design of nanophotonic perovskite layers that can be fabricated by nanoimprint lithography. Various design parameters of the nanophotonic perovskite layers such as the period (150–750 nm), the geometrical filling fraction (0.2–0.6) and the depth (0–500 nm) of the nanostructures are studied. A broad optimum to enhance JSC is found for a period of 400 nm. Finally, the angular stability of simulated nanophotonic perovskite solar cells is shown and their excellent light harvesting for realistic irradiation conditions is demonstrated by EY modelling.

Abstract: The relevance of perovskite photovoltaics is fully supported by its impressive development in recent years. Besides high efficiency, adoption of this technology requires obtaining long operational stability and cost-effective fabrication methods of large area devices. With the current perovskite solar cell (PSC) configurations (planar or meso n-i-p), it is difficult to deposit uniform pin-hole free films over large area at low temperature (<100 °C). In order to solve the above issues, we adopt a fabrication strategy for the scaling up of perovskite solar cells. Particularly, we study and fabricate a meso-superstructured p-type/intrinsic/n-type (p-i-n) cell (p-i-n-meso) configuration in which the insulating mesoporous layer of Al2O3 plays a key role in the fabrication of perovskite solar modules and therefore we also draw attention to this structure that has been out of the map for the fabrication of large area perovskite devices. The potential of this architecture is demonstrated through fabrication of devices ranging from small area (9 mm2) up to eight-cell CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite modules over substrates as large as 100 cm2. A record photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.3% and geometrical fill factor (GFF) of 84% was reached for a module with 17 cm2 of active area. Additionally, we carried out an in-situ monitoring of the photovoltaic parameters of one perovskite module for 2000 h under outdoor conditions, giving evidence of the high performance and stability of encapsulated perovskite photovoltaic technology in a real operational environment. This study paves the way to the upscaling of stable, efficient and full-solution-processed PSCs.

Abstract: Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a well-suited technique to prepare thin film heterostructures for solar cell applications. In this work, we explore the feasibility of preparing complete CIGS-type solar cells by ALD, namely the absorber layer, the buffer layer and the transparent conducting oxide window layers, with a focus on using an ultra-thin CIGS-type layer (<100 nm). The syntheses are carried out with ALD in a cross-flow reactor configuration. The materials used are the ternary material CuInS2 as absorber layer, the In2S3 as buffer layer and the bilayer ZnO/ZnO:Al as window layers. Structural (by Grazing incidence XRD), optical and electrical properties are characterized as a function of the experimental deposition conditions. The thickness of In2S3 and the deposition conditions of the window layers have been optimized on a coevaporated 2 μm-thick CIGS absorber as reference. Results are comparable to the classical stack CdS/ZnO/ZnO:Al deposited by chemical bath deposition and sputtering. Ultra-thin film CuInS2 (60 nm) has been then deposited and combined with the optimized ALD front layers. Preliminary results on completed solar cells are given with very low efficiency presently but paving the way of an all ALD CIGS layer route.

Abstract: Heterostructure of wide-bandgap materials have great potential for use in transparent optoelectronics for examples ultraviolet photodetectors, transparent solar cells, and transparent electronics. This study demonstrates the exciton, band-to-band and intermediate-band optical transitions in a ZnO/NiO heterostructure at room temperature. This heterostructure exhibits Ohmic current-voltage characteristics close to that of various metal contacts such as Ag, C, Ni, and Au. Temperature-dependence studies revealed that the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of ZnO/NiO heterostructure is limited by the charge-transfer potential, analogous to excitonic solar cells. A negligibly small dark current of 1.6 × 10−8 A, a large VOC of 675 mV and a photoresponse speeds of 9.4 μs make it promising for high-speed energy-efficient optoelectronics. The optoelectronic performances of the ZnO/NiO/Ag microink suggest that broadband photons can be utilized with incident photons to current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of 2% and 39% in the visible and ultraviolet regions, respectively which demonstrate that the ZnO/NiO heterostructure can acts as a broadband quantum optoelectronic device.

Abstract: In ultra-thin chalcopyrite solar cells and photovoltaic modules, efficient light management is required to increase the photocurrent and to gain in conversion efficiency. In this work we employ optical modelling to investigate different optical approaches and quantify their potential improvements in the short-circuit current density of Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) devices. For structures with an ultra-thin (500 nm) CIGS absorber, we study the improvements related to the introduction of (i) highly reflective metal back reflectors, (ii) internal nano-textures applied to the substrate and (iii) external micro-textures by using a light management foil. In the analysis we use CIGS devices in a PV module configuration, thus, solar cell structure including encapsulation and front glass. A thin Al2O3 layer was considered in the structure at the rear side of CIGS for passivation and diffusion barrier for metal reflectors. We show that not any individual aforementioned approach is sufficient to compensate for the short circuit drop related to ultra-thin absorber, but a combination of a highly reflective back contact and textures (internal or external) is needed to obtain and also exceed the short-circuit current density of a thick (1800 nm) CIGS absorber.

Abstract: In this work we investigate the effect of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the performance of solar cells consisting of different GaAsSbN-based structures and correlate the device results with modifications of the optical and structural properties of the alloy. In particular, bulk layers grown at different growth rates and type-II GaAsSb/GaAsN superlattices with different period thickness are analyzed. We find evidences of material quality improvement after the annealing process such as a reduction of N-related radiative defects and Sb clusters. These RTA-induced changes lead to a notable enhancement of the open circuit voltage (VOC), which results in values of the bandgap-voltage offset (WOC = EG/q-VOC) comparable to that of a non-optimized reference GaAs solar cell with the same device structure (WOC ∼0.63 eV). The decrease in WOC after annealing shows a correlation with the reduced radiative recombination at low energy N-related sub-bandgap states. These results suggest that radiative recombination in a broad band of deep defect states is a source of VOC degradation in GaAsSbN solar cells.

Abstract: Cancer stem cells are the cancer cells that have abilities to self-renew, differentiate into defined progenies, and initiate and maintain tumor growth. They also contribute to cancer metastasis and therapeutic resistance, both of which are the major causes of cancer mortality. Among the reported makers of the cancer stem cells, CD133 is the most well-known marker for isolating and studying cancer stem cells in different types of cancer. The CD133high population of cancer cells are not only capable of self-renewal, proliferation, but also highly metastatic and resistant to therapy. Despite very limited information on physiological functions of CD133, many ongoing studies are aimed to reveal the mechanisms that CD133 utilizes to modulate cancer dissemination and drug resistance with a long-term goal for bringing down the number of cancer deaths. In this review, in addition to the regulation of CD133, and its involvement in cancer initiation, and development, the recent updates on how CD133 modulates cancer dissemination, and therapeutic resistance are provided. The key signaling pathways that are upstream or downstream of CD133 during these processes are summarized. A comprehensive understanding of CD133-mediated cancer initiation, development, and dissemination through its pivotal role in cancer stem cells will offer new strategies in cancer therapy.

Abstract: Scale-up deposition methods in perovskite solar cell research, are mostly used under humidity environment outside the glove-box. Also, the as-printed absorbing layer before the post-annealing process is always wet. Thus, controlling the morphology and crystallization of perovskite thin-films in up-scaled deposition systems is difficult and strongly investigated by the researchers. In this work, we introduce an anti-solvent-free meniscus printing method in which, the absorbing perovskite film with optimal performance is achieved. To this end, we check the printing parameters to get to the optimized film characteristics. Also, a vacuum chamber (<100 Pa) is used for 30 s to remove the solvent with appropriate pace from the as-printed wet perovskite films. Based on using vacuum process, instead of low surface coverage needle-like morphology, a pinhole-free dense film with appropriate grain-size (400–500 nm) and thickness (~480 nm) was obtained. The perovskite devices with optimized meniscus printed films with and without vacuum process show a PCE of 10.1% and 2.3% respectively (with active area of 0.1 cm2). Also, the conversion efficiency of 8.0% was achieved with an active area of 1 cm2. The result demonstrated the merit of using vacuum process before post-annealing step.

Abstract: In this work, the TiO2 nanoparticles have been used for the fabrication of CdS/TiO2, CdSe/TiO2, ZnS/CdSe/CdS/TiO2, ZnS/CdSe:Cu/CdS/TiO2 and ZnS/CdSe:Mn/CdS/TiO2 quantum dot-sensitized solar cells. The TiO2 films are sensitized with consecutive layers of CdS, CdSe quantum dots. Further, Cu2+ or Mn2+ ions were doped on CdSe quantum dots by successive ion layer adsorption and reaction. The performance of the QDSSCs is examined in detail using polysulfide electrolyte with Cu2S counter electrode. The cells containing CdSe quantum dots doped with the these ions show an improved short circuit current density (∼20.01 mA/cm2) with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 4.31% under 1 sun illumination. This enhancement is mainly attributed due to the superior light harvesting ability of the CdSe:Cu or CdSe:Mn quantum dots and make large accumulation of photo-injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 nanoparticles. In addition, the combination of doped CdSe and the presence of CdS layers caused lower recombination of photo-injected electrons with the electrolyte. These changes are demonstrated in this studying by using photovoltaic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

Abstract: In this work, a phase change material based photo-thermal cells was prepared and the solar light triggered thermal storage charging and discharging property was investigated. The graphene nanosheet was uniformly dispersed into paraffin to form phase change materials based photo-thermal cells. The thermal conductivity, enthalpy, heat capacity, optical absorptive property and photo-thermal performance of photo-thermal cells were investigated. The results show that adding 50 ppm of graphene nanosheet in the phase change materials could largely improve the optical absorptive property in visible range and thermal storage capacity charging rate. To calculate the effective thermal storage capacity of phase change material, the results show that the phase change material based photo-thermal cells has larger effective thermal storage capacity than water, indicating the phase change material based photo-thermal cells is promising in solar thermal utilization systems.

Abstract: In the present work, a solar selective coating of ZrB2/Al2O3 was deposited onto stainless steel (SS) substrates using a magnetron sputtering system. The coating exhibited an good selective absorbing properties with an absorptance of 0.92 and an emittance of 0.11. To investigate the thermal stability of the coating, the samples were annealed at 500 °C and 600 °C for 100 h, respectively. Experimental results indicated that the coating was thermally stable at 500 °C. The structure and optical properties of the coating is also characterized using ultra-high resolution scanning electron microscope, UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The reflectance spectra of the SS/ZrB2/Al2O3 coating was successfully simulated by CODE software.

Abstract: In this study, a novel type of dual-responsive microencapsulated phase change material (PCM) was fabricated by encapsulating n-eicosane into a brookite TiO2 shell through emulsion-templated interfacial polycondensation, followed by impregnation of ZnO. The resulting microcapsules are expected not only to generate a thermal response by phase transitions of the PCM core but also to gain a photocatalytic response capability originated from the ZnO-doped TiO2 shell. The dual-responsive microcapsules were found to show a perfect core-shell microstructure as well as a regular morphology, and their chemical compositions and microstructure were determined by various spectroscopy and microscopy characterizations. The thermally responsive behaviors and phase change performance of the dual-responsive microcapsules were confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry and their photocatalytic response was identified by an antibacterial experiment. An applied research was carried out by incorporation of the dual-responsive microcapsules into the gypsum matrix, and the resulting gypsum/microcapsule composites not only presented a diverse range of superior thermal performance including prominent thermal regulation and thermal management capabilities, high thermal reliability, good operation durability and highly stable shape/form, but also showed an enhanced antibacterial function. This type of dual-responsive microcapsules exhibits a great potential for solar thermal energy-storage, energy-saving, healthcare and medical applications.

Abstract: Concentrated Solar Technology can produce process heat, power and fuels from solar energy in the temperature range 150–1500 °C, bringing the question of the receiver ability to reliably perform over the expected lifetime. Conventional methods commonly used to assess the mechanical stability and lifetime involve in-door laboratory testing, which suffers from the fundamental inability to reproduce the real operating conditions. A previous work introduced an original experimental setup based on acoustic emission named IMPACT (In situ thermo-Mechanical Probe by ACoustic Tracking), designed for an in situ and passive characterization of receiver materials under harsh thermo-mechanical stresses. This paper proposes an original method, based on a modelling approach, to control the sample damage amplification with IMPACT, and assess its relevance through an experimental campaign on two selected materials (SiC and Inconel 625).

Abstract: The identity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains an enigma, with the question outstanding of whether CSCs are fixed entities or plastic cell states in response to microenvironmental cues. Recent evidence highlights the power of the tumor microenvironment to dictate CSC functionality and spatiotemporal regulation that gives rise to tumor heterogeneity. This microenvironmental regulation of CSCs parallels that of normal tissues, whereby resident stem cells reside within specialized microenvironments or ‘niches’, which provide the cellular and molecular signals that wire every aspect of stem cell behavior and fate. The extracellular matrix (ECM), along with its sequestered growth factors, is a fundamental component of the stem cell niche. Pathological ECM remodeling is an established hallmark of cancer, with the ECM a key mediator of metastasis and drug resistance. In this review, we discuss the controversial identity of CSCs and new understanding of the impact of tumor microenvironment on CSC function and phenotype. We outline parallels between development, wound repair and cancer to discuss how changes in ECM dynamics influence stem cell function during normal physiological processes and pathological states, as well as the transition between the two in the form of precancerous lesions. We then explore examples illustrating the molecular circuits partnering cancer cells with stromal cells and how this communication involving ECM imparts a CSC phenotype and promotes chemoresistance. Understanding the mechanisms underlying CSC functionality and chemoresistance, along with mathematical modeling approaches and advancing technologies for targeting the undruggable proteome, should open opportunities for cancer breakthroughs in the future.

Abstract: To improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) prepared in humid air (RH = 55%), a new zinc oxide (ZnO):TIPD composite film is inserted between PCBM layer and Ag electrode for the first time. Compared to the single PCBM layer, the formed PCBM/ZnO:TIPD electron transport layer (ETL) has better coverage on the perovskite layer and more effective charge extraction ability from the perovskite layer. The insertion of ZnO:TIPD film effectively suppress the charge recombination at perovskite/ETL interface. Besides, the PCBM/ZnO:TIPD layer has better ability to prevent moisture from penetrating into the perovskite layer than single PCBM film. For these reasons, the PCE and stability of the PSCs with the PCBM/ZnO:TIPD are significantly improved compared to the PSCs with single PCBM (or ZnO:TIPD) layer. The highest efficiency of the cell with PCBM/ZnO:TIPD ETL reaches (13.7 ± 0.4)% in ambient atmosphere, which is 1.20 times that of the PSCs with PCBM only.

Abstract: Semi-transparent ultrathin Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) solar cells offer many promising applications but their efficiencies are still limited. In this work, SiO2 point contact structures were prepared using nanosphere lithography on Sn:In2O3 (ITO) substrate and ultrathin CIGSe solar cells were fabricated on top. It was discovered that the SiO2 point contact structure at the CIGSe/ITO interface behaves significantly different from at the CIGSe/Mo interface and does not improve the rear interface reflectivity or short-circuit current density. However, the SiO2 point contact structure brings pronounced electrical benefits, arising from the joint effect of reduced back recombination and induced field effect by internal charges. Semi-transparent ultrathin CIGSe solar cells with an absorber thickness of 380 nm exhibited a significant increase in open circuit voltage of 26 mV and fill factor of 9.4% (absolute). Consequently, the efficiency is improved by 23% (from absolute 6.8%–8.4%).

Abstract: Doping of CdTe using Group-V elements (As, P, and Sb) has gained interest in pursuit of increasing the cell voltage of CdTe thin film solar devices. Studies on bulk CdTe crystals have shown that much higher acceptor concentration than the traditional copper treatment is possible with As, P or Sb, enabled by high process temperature and/or rapid thermal quenching under Cd overpressure. We report a comprehensive study on in-situ As doping of poly-crystalline CdTe solar cells by MOCVD, whereby high acceptor densities, approaching 3 × 1016 cm−3 were achieved at low growth temperature of 390 °C. No As segregation could be detected at grain boundaries, even for 1019 As cm−3. A shallow acceptor level (+0.1 eV) due to AsTe substitutional doping and deep-level defects were observed at elevated As concentrations. Devices with variable As doping were analysed. Narrowing of the depletion layer, enhancement of bulk recombination, and reduction in device current and red response, albeit a small near infrared gain due to optical gap reduction, were observed at high concentrations. Device modelling indicated that the properties of the n-type window layer and associated interfacial recombination velocity are highly critical when the absorber doping is relatively high, demonstrating a route for obtaining high cell voltage.

Abstract: Substance P (SP) is believed to play a role in traumatic brain injury (TBI), and the inhibition of binding of SP to the tachykinin neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) using NK1R antagonists had made favorable effects on TBI. Our current study addresses the functional roles and underlying mechanisms of SP and NK1R antagonist L-733,060 following TBI. Adult male wild type C57BL/6 J and SP knock out (SPKO) mice received a controlled cortical impact and outcome parameters were assessed. The results showed that TBI-induced motor and spatial memory deficits, lesion volume, brain water content and blood-brain barrier disruption were alleviated both in L-733,060-treated C57BL/6 J mice and vehicle-treated SPKO mice. L-733,060 treatment and SP deletion inhibited TBI-induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm, activation of caspase-3, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Higher SP levels in serum and cortex were observed in wild type mice undergoing TBI relative to wild type sham group, but very little expression of cortical SP was detected in the SP-/- mice either TBI or not. Upregulation of NK1R expression after TBI was observed, and there was no significant difference between wild type and SPKO groups. in vitro, L-733,060 and SP deletion inhibited scratch injury-induced cell death, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production following TBI. Together, the results of this study implicate a functional role for NK1-R antagonist L-733,060 and deletion of SP in TBI-induced neurological outcome, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation and cell death. Upregulation of NK1R maybe a consequence of TBI, independent of the levels of substance P. This study raises the possibility that targeting SP through its receptor NK1R or genetic deletion may have therapeutic efficacy in TBI.

Abstract: We present clear evidence of excellent resilience to potential-induced degradation (PID) from polysilicon passivated contacts implemented on the rear of n-type solar cells. Under the stress conditions of −1000 V, 50 °C, 30% relative humidity with aluminum foil, no damage was caused to the passivated contact consisting of an ultrathin silicon oxide (SiOx) film and an n+-doped polysilicon (poly-Si) layer after 168 h. With +1000 V bias and under the same chamber conditions, the SiOx/poly-Si (n+) passivated contact showed a slight change that translated into about 1% module power loss after 168 h, which is significantly lower than the 5% threshold recommended by IEC 62804-1 PID test standard. Furthermore, the SiOx/poly-Si (n+) passivated contact, even when encapsulated with ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer films having a low volume resistivity in the range of 5 × 1014 Ω⸱cm, exhibited good stability under high-voltage stress. The experimental results were also validated by a generic device simulation, where the SiOx/poly-Si (n+) stack was shown to be immune to the surface polarization effect. In addition, a promising cell-level solution (i.e., using a stack of aluminium oxide and silicon nitride) to the polarization-type PID for n-type passivated emitter rear totally diffused silicon solar cells was also demonstrated.

Abstract: Flexible gasochromic solar energy devices have received extensive attention in recent years. It is difficult to prepare flexible gas chromogenic films by traditional methods. In practical application, with the rise of temperature, the performance of the conventional gasochromic film decreases significantly and is even completely unusable. Therefore, it is necessary to develop gasochromic films with good high temperature resistance. Photo-deposition, a simple method to prepare porous tungsten oxide gasochromic film using tungsten hexachloride and ethanol was reported. We developed this facile method to prepare the flexible edge-sharing WO3 gasochromic films on Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The WO3 films prepared by this method on glass can keep the high porosity after heated at 250 °C and also can keep the fast speed of the gasochromic (tc,90%=22 s and tb=4 s) after 300 cycles. In addition, the gasochromic films still can be homogeneous extraordinarily after folded 180 degrees for 100 times. Finally, we also demonstrate a flexible tent consist of WO3 gasochromic films by this way which is a possible use of the film we proposed by coating on PET.

Abstract: Degradation of organic solar cells (OSC) remains a problem which has prevented its commercial exploitation. While there are several experimental studies pointing towards different reasons behind the atmospheric degradation of these devices, yet a microscopic understanding is lacking. Here, we present a combined experimental and modeling study to understand the degradation in the electrical characteristics of OSC in normal and inverted architectures, further correlated with the interfacial degradation. Our investigations show that degradation of current density – voltage (J-V) characteristics of normal devices is extremely fast i.e. 50% in 9 h as against 21 days for inverted devices. Interestingly, degradation in normal devices is driven primarily by a decrease in short circuit current density (Jsc) without appearance of S-shape in J-V characteristics while degraded inverted devices exhibit S-shaped J-V characteristics. Modeling of J-V data along with time dependent capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis suggests that the degradation in normal OSC devices can be modeled using degradation induced reduced effective area theory supporting the formation of Al2O3 pockets at the cathode-active layer interface which grow exponentially with storage time eventually forming a continuous layer. In contrast, inverted devices degrade much slowly, via deterioration of hole transporting MoO3 layer resulting in increased anode barrier height and reduced surface recombination velocity (Sp) at anode causing a S shaped J-V curve due to decreased carrier extraction rate. The study clearly highlights the differences between the way two differences architectures and elucidates the underlying reasons.

Abstract: We have demonstrated that Prussian green (PG) film can be directly grown on fluorine-doped tin oxides (FTO) glass by a facile, template-free and one-step hydrothermal process, and a reaction mechanism for the formation of PG film under the hydrothermal conditions is also proposed. The as-grown PG film exhibits a much better cycling stability than PG film prepared by electrochemical method. The electrochromic device based on the as-grown PG film shows reversible and multi-stage color changes among green, blue and colorless states. Large optical modulations of 58% and 42% between colorless and both blue and green state, respectively, fast switching times of 1.1 and 2.4 s and a high coloration efficiency of 79.1 cm2 C−1 are also achieved for the PG device, making it promising candidates for applications in high-performance smart windows and displays.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women across the globe. The major reason for its recurrence and high mortality is due to the presence of a drug refractory and self-renewing population of cells, the cancer stem cells (CSCs). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently emerged as a promising cell-based therapeutic agent for the treatment of different cancer types. However, the anti-tumor effect of MSCs has been indicated to be substantially reduced by their in vivo tumor-trophic migration property and direct cell-to-cell integration with tumor stromal elements. To address this drawback, the present study uses a biomaterial, sodium alginate, for the encapsulation of MSCs from the perinatal tissue, Wharton’s jelly (WJMSCs) into microbeads, to study the effect of WJMSCs beads on breast CSCs derived from two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7. Encapsulation with sodium alginate facilitated the prevention of direct cell-to-cell interaction and these microbeads provided a three-dimensional (3D) microenvironment for the encapsulated WJMSCs (eWJMSCs). Compared to two dimensional (2D) culture, eWJMSC increased proliferation of WJMSCs with an increase in pluripotency genes, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune-modulation, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, the tumor invasion suppressor protein E-cadherin was highly expressed in eWJMSCs as shown by Western blot analysis. In addition, eWJMSCs had an increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines VEGF, TGF-β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-10 and -6, and IL-3β when compared to 2D culture. Treatment of CSCs with eWJMSCs reduced cell viability, inhibited migration, and exerted an anti-angiogenic effect. eWJMSCs treatment of CSCs increased caspase 3/7 activity, nitric oxide production, and reactive oxygen species production, suggesting its anti-tumorigenic activity. Gene expression analysis revealed that CSCs treated with eWJMSCs had a downregulation of pro-proliferation markers, drug transporters, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated markers, and angiogenesis related genes. The mode of anti-proliferative action of WJMSCs beads was possibly through inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as indicated by the upregulation of the Wnt antagonists sFRP4 and DKK1. These data suggest that alginate-encapsulated WJMSCs could be an efficient cell contact-free system for developing stem cell-based therapies for CSCs.

Abstract: In this paper, we report characterization and performance results of lead bromide perovskite luminescent solar concentrator. CH3NH3PbBr3 fluorophores are synthesized by sonication method and examined by their X-ray diffraction pattern and scanning electron microscopy. Synthesized perovskite shows excitonic absorption at 524 nm and PL emission peak located at 532 nm with a Stokes shift around 8 nm. Micron-sized fluorophores are dissolved in prepared solutions and uniformly embedded in PMMA host with 0.006–0.120%wt concentration. Then, Fabricated devices are cut into 50 × 30 × 5 mm cuboid shapes and placed in a mirror surrounded configuration with an attached photovoltaic cell. Fabricated device is put under standard AM1.5 illumination and the output spectrum from the concentrator is acquired. Re-absorption in the samples is also measured by variable optical path method, showing red-shifts up to 13 nm in the output spectrum. Spatially resolved photoluminescence maps and optical efficiencies are also presented for each sample. Plus, a Monte-Carlo ray tracing algorithm is developed to assist better understanding the experimental results. Stability of fabricated samples are evaluated under high intensity UV illumination, reporting efficiency reduction around 15% after 24 h. Finally, Comparing current-voltage characterization of the attached photovoltaic cell reveals optimized efficiency enhancement in the 0.04%wt sample above 65%.

Abstract: Novel small-molecules, B2T and B2F, based on benzobis(thiadiazole) have been designed and synthesized as electron transporting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Benefiting from the high electron affinity of benzobis(thiadiazole) unit, both B2T and B2F exhibited an efficient electron transporting ability in CH3NH3PbI3-xClx planar-heterojunction (PHJ) PSCs. The device based on B2T exhibited an optimal power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.0%, while that of B2F was 15.0% with a relatively low hysteresis. Compared to B2T device, the higher efficiency of B2F device was mainly due to the impressive increase in short-circuit current density (JSC), from 19.36 mA cm−2 to 22.13 mA cm−2. By comprehensive analysis of the energy level and photoluminescence spectra of the devices, we inferred that the higher JSC was resulted from the lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of B2F than B2T, which induced a more efficient hole-blocking and less recombination of charge carriers. Through the molecular design (from thiophene to fluorene), we developed a highly efficient electron transporting material, this strategy may provide a new building block to develop novel efficient interface materials for PSCs.
