Abstract: Summary
RNAi has enabled researchers to study the function of many genes. However, it is not understood why some RNAi experiments succeed while others do not. Here, we show in C. elegans that pharyngeal muscle is resistant to RNAi when initially exposed to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by feeding but sensitive to RNAi in the next generation. Investigating this observation, we find that pharyngeal muscle cells as well as vulval muscle cells require nuclear rather than cytoplasmic RNAi. Further, we find in these cell types that nuclear RNAi silencing is most efficiently triggered during early development, defining a critical period for initiating nuclear RNAi. Finally, using heat-shock-induced dsRNA expression, we show that synMuv B class mutants act in part to extend this critical window. The synMuv-B-dependent early-development-associated critical period for initiating nuclear RNAi suggests that mechanisms that restrict developmental plasticity may also restrict the initiation of nuclear RNAi.

Abstract: Summary
Whereas type I interferons (IFNs-I) were proposed to be elevated in human periodontitis, their role in the disease remains elusive. Using a bacterial-induced model of murine periodontitis, we revealed a prolonged elevation in IFN-I expression. This was due to the downregulation of TAM signaling, a major negative regulator of IFN-I. Further examination revealed that the expression of certain TAM components was reduced as a result of prolonged degradation of MYD88 by the infection. As a result of such prolonged IFN-I production, innate immunological functions of the gingiva were disrupted, and CD4+ T cells were constitutively primed by dendritic cells, leading to elevated RANKL expression and, subsequently, alveolar bone loss (ABL). Blocking IFN-I signaling restored proper immunological function and prevented ABL. Importantly, a loss of negative regulation on IFN-I expression by TAM signaling was also evident in periodontitis patients. These findings thus suggest a role for IFN-I in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

Abstract: Summary
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) stimulates Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the response is potentiated by 3′,5′-cyclic AMP (cAMP). We investigated this interaction in HEK293 cells using carbachol and parathyroid hormone (PTH) to stimulate formation of IP3 and cAMP, respectively. PTH alone had no effect on the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, but it potentiated the Ca2+ signals evoked by carbachol. Surprisingly, however, the intracellular Ca2+ stores that respond to carbachol alone could be both emptied and refilled without affecting the subsequent response to PTH. We provide evidence that PTH unmasks high-affinity IP3 receptors within a discrete Ca2+ store. We conclude that Ca2+ stores within the ER that dynamically exchange Ca2+ with the cytosol maintain a functional independence that allows one store to be released by carbachol and another to be released by carbachol with PTH. Compartmentalization of ER Ca2+ stores adds versatility to IP3-evoked Ca2+ signals.

Abstract: Summary
Indirect evidence from human studies suggests that brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis is fueled predominantly by fatty acids hydrolyzed from intracellular triglycerides (TGs). However, no direct experimental evidence to support this assumption currently exists in humans. The aim of this study was to determine the role of intracellular TG in BAT thermogenesis, in cold-exposed men. Using positron emission tomography with 11C-acetate and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, we showed that oral nicotinic acid (NiAc) administration, an inhibitor of intracellular TG lipolysis, suppressed the cold-induced increase in BAT oxidative metabolism and glucose uptake, despite no difference in BAT blood flow. There was a commensurate increase in shivering intensity and shift toward a greater reliance on glycolytic muscle fibers without modifying total heat production. Together, these findings show that intracellular TG lipolysis is critical for BAT thermogenesis and provides experimental evidence for a reciprocal role of BAT thermogenesis and shivering in cold-induced thermogenesis in humans.

Abstract: Summary
Fumarate hydratase (FH) is an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle mutated in hereditary and sporadic cancers. Despite recent advances in understanding its role in tumorigenesis, the effects of FH loss on mitochondrial metabolism are still unclear. Here, we used mouse and human cell lines to assess mitochondrial function of FH-deficient cells. We found that human and mouse FH-deficient cells exhibit decreased respiration, accompanied by a varying degree of dysfunction of respiratory chain (RC) complex I and II. Moreover, we show that fumarate induces succination of key components of the iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis family of proteins, leading to defects in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters that affect complex I function. We also demonstrate that suppression of complex II activity is caused by product inhibition due to fumarate accumulation. Overall, our work provides evidence that the loss of a single TCA cycle enzyme is sufficient to cause combined RC activity dysfunction.

IDH1 Mutation Promotes Tumorigenesis by Inhibiting JNK Activation and Apoptosis Induced by Serum Starvation,

Abstract: Summary
Two hallmarks of cancer cells are their resistance to apoptosis and ability to thrive despite reduced levels of vital serum components. c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation is crucial for apoptosis triggered by serum starvation (SS), and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations are tumorigenic, in part, because they produce the abnormal metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). However, it is unknown whether 2-HG-induced tumorigenesis is partially due to JNK inhibition and thus defective SS-induced apoptosis. We show here, using IDH1-R132Q knockin mutant mouse cells, that 2-HG inhibits JNK activation induced only by SS and not by UV or doxorubicin, and thus can block apoptosis. Upon SS, Cdc42 normally disrupts mixed lineage kinase 3’s (MLK3’s) auto-inhibition, triggering the MLK3-MKK4/7-JNK-Bim apoptotic cascade. 2-HG binds to Cdc42 and abolishes its association with MLK3, inactivating MLK3 and apoptosis. Allograft tumor assays in mice demonstrate that this mechanism contributes to tumorigenesis driven by mutant IDH1, a result confirmed by detection of JNK inactivation in human gliomas harboring IDH1-R132H mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Although hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs) were thought to comprise a uniform population, recent evidence supports two distinct sublayers along the radial axis, with deep neurons more likely to form place cells than superficial neurons. CA1 PNs also differ along the transverse axis with regard to direct inputs from entorhinal cortex (EC), with medial EC (MEC) providing spatial information to PNs toward CA2 (proximal CA1) and lateral EC (LEC) providing non-spatial information to PNs toward subiculum (distal CA1). We demonstrate that the two inputs differentially activate the radial sublayers and that this difference reverses along the transverse axis, with MEC preferentially targeting deep PNs in proximal CA1 and LEC preferentially exciting superficial PNs in distal CA1. This differential excitation reflects differences in dendritic spine numbers. Our results reveal a heterogeneity in EC-CA1 connectivity that may help explain differential roles of CA1 PNs in spatial and non-spatial learning and memory.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia and astrocytes become reactive following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the coordination of this reactivity and its relation to pathophysiology are unclear. Here, we show that microglia transform astrocytes into a neuroprotective phenotype via downregulation of the P2Y1 purinergic receptor. TBI initially caused microglial activation in the injury core, followed by reactive astrogliosis in the peri-injured region and formation of a neuroprotective astrocyte scar. Equivalent changes to astrocytes were observed in vitro after injury. This change in astrocyte phenotype resulted from P2Y1 receptor downregulation, mediated by microglia-derived cytokines. In mice, astrocyte-specific P2Y1 receptor overexpression (Astro-P2Y1OE) counteracted scar formation, while astrocyte-specific P2Y1 receptor knockdown (Astro-P2Y1KD) facilitated scar formation, suggesting critical roles of P2Y1 receptors in the transformation. Astro-P2Y1OE and Astro-P2Y1KD mice showed increased and reduced neuronal damage, respectively. Altogether, our findings indicate that microglia-astrocyte interaction, involving a purinergic signal, is essential for the formation of neuroprotective astrocytes.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems defend microbes against foreign nucleic acids via RNA-guided endonucleases. Using a computational sequence database mining approach, we identify two class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems (subtype VI-B) that lack Cas1 and Cas2 and encompass a single large effector protein, Cas13b, along with one of two previously uncharacterized associated proteins, Csx27 and Csx28. We establish that these CRISPR-Cas systems can achieve RNA interference when heterologously expressed. Through a combination of biochemical and genetic experiments, we show that Cas13b processes its own CRISPR array with short and long direct repeats, cleaves target RNA, and exhibits collateral RNase activity. Using an E. coli essential gene screen, we demonstrate that Cas13b has a double-sided protospacer-flanking sequence and elucidate RNA secondary structure requirements for targeting. We also find that Csx27 represses, whereas Csx28 enhances, Cas13b-mediated RNA interference. Characterization of these CRISPR systems creates opportunities to develop tools to manipulate and monitor cellular transcripts.

Abstract: Summary
Notch signaling in neural progenitor cell is triggered by ligands expressed in adjacent cells. To identify the sources of active Notch ligands in the mouse retina, we negatively regulated Notch ligand activity in various neighbors of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) by eliminating mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (Mib1). Mib1-deficient retinal cells failed to induce Notch activation in intra-lineage RPCs, which prematurely differentiated into neurons; however, Mib1 in post-mitotic retinal ganglion cells was not important. Interestingly, Mib1 in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) also contributed to Notch activation in adjacent RPCs by supporting the localization of active Notch ligands at RPE-RPC contacts. Combining this RPE-driven Notch signaling and intra-retinal Notch signaling, we propose a model in which one RPC daughter receives extra Notch signals from the RPE to become an RPC, whereas its sister cell receives only a subthreshold level of intra-retinal Notch signal and differentiates into a neuron.

Abstract: Summary
p62/SQSTM1 (p62) is a scaffolding protein that facilitates the formation and degradation of ubiquitinated aggregates via its self-interaction and ubiquitin binding domains. The regulation of this process is unclear but may relate to the post-translational modification of p62. In the present study, we find that Keap1/Cullin3 ubiquitinates p62 at lysine 420 within its UBA domain. Substitution of lysine 420 with an arginine diminishes p62 sequestration and degradation activity similar what is seen when the UBA domain is deleted. Overexpression of Keap1/Cullin3 in p62-WT-expressing cells increases ubiquitinated inclusion formation and p62's association with LC3 and rescues proteotoxicity. This effect is not seen in cells expressing a mutant p62 that fails to interact with Keap1. Interestingly, p62 disease mutants have diminished or absent UBA domain ubiquitination. These data suggest that the ubiquitination of p62’s UBA domain at lysine 420 may regulate p62’s function and be disrupted in p62-associated disease.

Abstract: Summary
The Arabidopsis thaliana root epidermis is comprised of two cell types, hair and nonhair cells, which differentiate from the same precursor. Although the transcriptional programs regulating these events are well studied, post-transcriptional factors functioning in this cell fate decision are mostly unknown. Here, we globally identify RNA-protein interactions and RNA secondary structure in hair and nonhair cell nuclei. This analysis reveals distinct structural and protein binding patterns across both transcriptomes, allowing identification of differential RNA binding protein (RBP) recognition sites. Using these sequences, we identify two RBPs that regulate hair cell development. Specifically, we find that SERRATE functions in a microRNA-dependent manner to inhibit hair cell fate, while also terminating growth of root hairs mostly independent of microRNA biogenesis. In addition, we show that GLYCINE-RICH PROTEIN 8 promotes hair cell fate while alleviating phosphate starvation stress. In total, this global analysis reveals post-transcriptional regulators of plant root epidermal cell fate.

Abstract: We hypothesized that inflammation affects number and activity of osteoclasts (OCs) via enhancing autophagy. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced autophagy, osteoclastogenesis, and cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bone marrow-derived macrophages that were pre-stimulated with receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand. An autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) decreased LPS-induced OC formation and bone resorption, indicating that autophagy is responsible for increasing number and activity of OCs upon LPS stimulus. Knockdown of autophagy-related protein 7 attenuated the effect of LPS on OC-specific genes, supporting a role of LPS as an autophagy inducer in OC. Removal of ROS decreased LPS-induced OC formation as well as autophagy. However, 3-MA did not affect LPS-induced ROS levels, suggesting that ROS act upstream of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase in LPS-induced autophagy. Our results suggest the possible use of autophagy inhibitors targeting OCs to reduce inflammatory bone loss.

Abstract: Summary
Serine hydrolases are a large family of multifunctional enzymes known to influence obesity. Here, we performed activity-based protein profiling to assess the functional level of serine hydrolases in liver biopsies from lean and obese humans in order to gain mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of metabolic disease. We identified reduced hepatic activity of carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) and arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) in human obesity. In primary human hepatocytes, CES2 knockdown impaired glucose storage and lipid oxidation. In mice, obesity reduced CES2, whereas adenoviral delivery of human CES2 reversed hepatic steatosis, improved glucose tolerance, and decreased inflammation. Lipidomic analysis identified a network of CES2-regulated lipids altered in human and mouse obesity. CES2 possesses triglyceride and diacylglycerol lipase activities and displayed an inverse correlation with HOMA-IR and hepatic diacylglycerol concentrations in humans. Thus, decreased CES2 is a conserved feature of obesity and plays a causative role in the pathogenesis of obesity-related metabolic disturbances.

Abstract: Summary
Amino acid taste is expected to be a universal property among animals. Although sweet, bitter, salt, and water tastes have been well characterized in insects, the mechanisms underlying amino acid taste remain elusive. From a Drosophila RNAi screen, we identify an ionotropic receptor, Ir76b, as necessary for yeast preference. Using calcium imaging, we identify Ir76b+ amino acid taste neurons in legs, overlapping partially with sweet neurons but not those that sense other tastants. Ir76b mutants have reduced responses to amino acids, which are rescued by transgenic expression of Ir76b and a mosquito ortholog AgIr76b. Co-expression of Ir20a with Ir76b is sufficient for conferring amino acid responses in sweet-taste neurons. Notably, Ir20a also serves to block salt response of Ir76b. Our study establishes the role of a highly conserved receptor in amino acid taste and suggests a mechanism for mutually exclusive roles of Ir76b in salt- and amino-acid-sensing neurons.

Abstract: Summary
In plant cells, changes in fluidity of the plasma membrane may serve as the primary sensor of cold stress; however, the precise mechanism and how the cell transduces and fine-tunes cold signals remain elusive. Here we show that the cold-activated plasma membrane protein cold-responsive protein kinase 1 (CRPK1) phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins. The phosphorylated 14-3-3 proteins shuttle from the cytosol to the nucleus, where they interact with and destabilize the key cold-responsive C-repeat-binding factor (CBF) proteins. Consistent with this, the crpk1 and 14-3-3κλ mutants show enhanced freezing tolerance, and transgenic plants overexpressing 14-3-3λ show reduced freezing tolerance. Further study shows that CRPK1 is essential for the nuclear translocation of 14-3-3 proteins and for 14-3-3 function in freezing tolerance. Thus, our study reveals that the CRPK1-14-3-3 module transduces the cold signal from the plasma membrane to the nucleus to modulate CBF stability, which ensures a faithfully adjusted response to cold stress of plants.

Abstract: Summary
PKCε, an oncogenic member of the PKC family, is aberrantly overexpressed in epithelial cancers. To date, little is known about functional interactions of PKCε with other genetic alterations, as well as the effectors contributing to its tumorigenic and metastatic phenotype. Here, we demonstrate that PKCε cooperates with the loss of the tumor suppressor Pten for the development of prostate cancer in a mouse model. Mechanistic analysis revealed that PKCε overexpression and Pten loss individually and synergistically upregulate the production of the chemokine CXCL13, which involves the transcriptional activation of the CXCL13 gene via the non-canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. Notably, targeted disruption of CXCL13 or its receptor, CXCR5, in prostate cancer cells impaired their migratory and tumorigenic properties. In addition to providing evidence for an autonomous vicious cycle driven by PKCε, our studies identified a compelling rationale for targeting the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis for prostate cancer treatment.

BMP2 and TGFβ1 are functional antagonists of pathological remodeling in the arteries, heart, and lung; however, the mechanisms in VSMCs, and their disturbance in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), are unclear. We found a pro-proliferative TGFβ1-Stat3-FoxO1 axis in VSMCs, and PPARγ as inhibitory regulator of TGFβ1-Stat3-FoxO1 and TGFβ1-Smad3/4, by physically interacting with Stat3 and Smad3. TGFβ1 induces fibrosis-related genes and miR-130a/301b, suppressing PPARγ. Conversely, PPARγ inhibits TGFβ1-induced mitochondrial activation and VSMC proliferation, and regulates two glucose metabolism-related enzymes, platelet isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFKP, a PPARγ target, via miR-331-5p) and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3G (PPP1R3G, a Smad3 target). PPARγ knockdown/deletion in VSMCs activates TGFβ1 signaling. The PPARγ agonist pioglitazone reverses PAH and inhibits the TGFβ1-Stat3-FoxO1 axis in TGFβ1-overexpressing mice. We identified PPARγ as a missing link between BMP2 and TGFβ1 pathways in VSMCs. PPARγ activation can be beneficial in TGFβ1-associated diseases, such as PAH, parenchymal lung diseases, and Marfan’s syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Dysfunction in host immune responses and pathologic alterations in the gut microbiota, referred to as dysbiosis, can both contribute to the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, it remains unclear how specific changes in host immunity or the microbiota cause disease. We previously demonstrated that the loss of the innate immune receptor NLRP6 in mice resulted in impaired production of interleukin-18 (IL-18) and increased susceptibility to epithelial-induced injury. Here, we show that NLRP6 is important for suppressing the development of spontaneous colitis in the Il10−/− mice model of IBD and that NLRP6 deficiency results in the enrichment of Akkermansia muciniphila. A. muciniphila was sufficient for promoting intestinal inflammation in both specific-pathogen-free and germ-free Il10−/− mice. Our results demonstrate that A. muciniphila can act as a pathobiont to promote colitis in a genetically susceptible host and that NLRP6 is a key regulator of its abundance.

Abstract: Summary
During brain development, the correct migration of newborn neurons is one of the determinants of circuit formation, and neuronal migration defects may lead to neurological and psychiatric disorders. The molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal migration and related disorders are poorly understood. Here, we report that Chromodomain Y-like (CDYL) is critical for neuronal migration in mice. Knocking down CDYL caused neuronal migration defects and disrupted both mobility and multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating neurons. We find that CDYL regulates neuronal migration by transcriptionally repressing RhoA. In addition, CDYL deficiency increased the excitability of cortical pyramidal neurons and the susceptibility of mice to convulsant-induced seizures. These results demonstrate that CDYL is a regulator of neuronal migration and shed light on the pathogenesis of seizure-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The CCHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP/ZNF9) is conserved in eukaryotes and is essential for embryonic development in mammals. It has been implicated in transcriptional, as well as post-transcriptional, gene regulation; however, its nucleic acid ligands and molecular function remain elusive. Here, we use multiple systems-wide approaches to identify CNBP targets and function. We used photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) to identify 8,420 CNBP binding sites on 4,178 mRNAs. CNBP preferentially bound G-rich elements in the target mRNA coding sequences, most of which were previously found to form G-quadruplex and other stable structures in vitro. Functional analyses, including RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and quantitative mass spectrometry, revealed that CNBP binding did not influence target mRNA abundance but rather increased their translational efficiency. Considering that CNBP binding prevented G-quadruplex structure formation in vitro, we hypothesize that CNBP is supporting translation by resolving stable structures on mRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Follicular T helper (TFH) cells orchestrate the germinal center (GC) response locally. TFH localization in GCs is controlled by chemo-guidance cues and antigen-specific adhesion. Here. we define an antigen-independent, contact-dependent, adhesive guidance system for TFH cells. Unusual for amoeboid cell migration, the system is composed of transmembrane plexin B2 (PlxnB2) molecule, which is highly expressed by GC B cells, and its transmembrane binding partner semaphorin 4C (Sema4C), which is upregulated on TFH cells. Sema4C on TFH cells serves as a receptor to sense the GC-presented PlxnB2 cue and biases TFH migration inwards at the GC edge to promote GC access. The absence of PlxnB2 from the GC or Sema4C from TFH cells causes TFH accumulation along the GC border, impairs T-B cell interactions in the GC, and is associated with defective plasma cell production and affinity maturation. Therefore, Sema4C and PlxnB2 regulate GC TFH recruitment and function and optimize antibody responses.

Abstract: Summary
The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed the genomic landscapes of human cancers. In parallel, immunotherapy is transforming the treatment of advanced cancers. Unfortunately, the majority of patients do not respond to immunotherapy, making the identification of predictive markers and the mechanisms of resistance an area of intense research. To increase our understanding of tumor-immune cell interactions, we characterized the intratumoral immune landscapes and the cancer antigenomes from 20 solid cancers and created The Cancer Immunome Atlas (https://tcia.at/). Cellular characterization of the immune infiltrates showed that tumor genotypes determine immunophenotypes and tumor escape mechanisms. Using machine learning, we identified determinants of tumor immunogenicity and developed a scoring scheme for the quantification termed immunophenoscore. The immunophenoscore was a superior predictor of response to anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies in two independent validation cohorts. Our findings and this resource may help inform cancer immunotherapy and facilitate the development of precision immuno-oncology.

Abstract: Summary
Many pathogens initiate infection at mucosal surfaces, and tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells play an important role in protective immunity, yet the tissue-specific signals that regulate Trm differentiation are poorly defined. During Yersinia infection, CD8+ T cell recruitment to areas of inflammation within the intestine is required for differentiation of the CD103−CD69+ Trm subset. Intestinal proinflammatory microenvironments have elevated interferon (IFN)-β and interleukin-12 (IL-12), which regulated Trm markers, including CD103. Type I interferon-receptor- or IL-12-receptor-deficient T cells functioned similarly to wild-type (WT) cells during infection; however, the inability of T cells to respond to inflammation resulted in defective differentiation of CD103−CD69+ Trm cells and reduced Trm persistence. Intestinal macrophages were the main producers of IFN-β and IL-12 during infection, and deletion of CCR2+ IL-12-producing cells reduced the size of the CD103− Trm population. These data indicate that intestinal inflammation drives phenotypic diversity and abundance of Trm cells for optimal tissue-specific immunity.

Abstract: Summary
In mammalian cells, histone deacetylase (HDAC) and Sirtuin (SIRT) are two families responsible for removing acetyl groups from acetylated proteins. Here, we describe protein deacetylation coupled with deacetylimination as a function of lysyl oxidase (LOX) family members. LOX-like 3 (Loxl3) associates with Stat3 in the nucleus to deacetylate and deacetyliminate Stat3 on multiple acetyl-lysine sites. Surprisingly, Loxl3 N-terminal scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) repeats, rather than the C-terminal oxidase catalytic domain, represent the major deacetylase/deacetyliminase activity. Loxl3-mediated deacetylation/deacetylimination disrupts Stat3 dimerization, abolishes Stat3 transcription activity, and restricts cell proliferation. In Loxl3−/− mice, Stat3 is constitutively acetylated and naive CD4+ T cells are potentiated in Th17/Treg cell differentiation. When overexpressed, the SRCR repeats from other LOX family members can catalyze protein deacetylation/deacetylimination. Thus, our findings delineate a hitherto-unknown mechanism of protein deacetylation and deacetylimination catalyzed by lysyl oxidases.

Abstract: Summary
Loss or inactivation of the histone H3K27 demethylase UTX occurs in several malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). Using an isogenic cell system, we found that loss of UTX leads to deactivation of gene expression ultimately promoting the proliferation, clonogenicity, adhesion, and tumorigenicity of MM cells. Moreover, UTX mutant cells showed increased in vitro and in vivo sensitivity to inhibition of EZH2, a histone methyltransferase that generates H3K27me3. Such sensitivity was related to a decrease in the levels of IRF4 and c-MYC and an activation of repressors of IRF4 characteristic of germinal center B cells such as BCL6 and IRF1. Rebalance of H3K27me3 levels at specific genes through EZH2 inhibitors may be a therapeutic strategy in MM cases harboring UTX mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial network remodeling between fused and fragmented states facilitates mitophagy, interaction with other organelles, and metabolic flexibility. Aging is associated with a loss of mitochondrial network homeostasis, but cellular processes causally linking these changes to organismal senescence remain unclear. Here, we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and dietary restriction (DR) promote longevity in C. elegans via maintaining mitochondrial network homeostasis and functional coordination with peroxisomes to increase fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Inhibiting fusion or fission specifically blocks AMPK- and DR-mediated longevity. Strikingly, however, preserving mitochondrial network homeostasis during aging by co-inhibition of fusion and fission is sufficient itself to increase lifespan, while dynamic network remodeling is required for intermittent fasting-mediated longevity. Finally, we show that increasing lifespan via maintaining mitochondrial network homeostasis requires FAO and peroxisomal function. Together, these data demonstrate that mechanisms that promote mitochondrial homeostasis and plasticity can be targeted to promote healthy aging.

Abstract: Summary
A decline in proteasome function is causally connected to neuronal aging and aging-associated neuropathologies. By using hippocampal neurons in culture and in vivo, we show that aging triggers a reduction and a cytoplasm-to-nucleus redistribution of the E3 ubiquitin ligase mahogunin (MGRN1). Proteasome impairment induces MGRN1 monoubiquitination, the key post-translational modification for its nuclear entry. One potential mechanism for MGRN1 monoubiquitination is via progressive deubiquitination at the proteasome of polyubiquitinated MGRN1. Once in the nucleus, MGRN1 potentiates the transcriptional cellular response to proteotoxic stress. Inhibition of MGRN1 impairs ATF3-mediated neuronal responsiveness to proteosomal stress and increases neuronal stress, while increasing MGRN1 ameliorates signs of neuronal aging, including cognitive performance in old animals. Our results imply that, among others, the strength of neuronal survival in a proteasomal deterioration background, like during aging, depends on the fine-tuning of ubiquitination-deubiquitination.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 Tat activates viral transcription and limited Tat transactivation correlates with latency establishment. We postulated a “block-and-lock” functional cure approach based on properties of the Tat inhibitor didehydro-Cortistatin A (dCA). HIV-1 transcriptional inhibitors could block ongoing viremia during antiretroviral therapy (ART), locking the HIV promoter in persistent latency. We investigated this hypothesis in human CD4+ T cells isolated from aviremic individuals. Combining dCA with ART accelerates HIV-1 suppression and prevents viral rebound after treatment interruption, even during strong cellular activation. We show that dCA mediates epigenetic silencing by increasing nucleosomal occupancy at Nucleosome-1, restricting RNAPII recruitment to the HIV-1 promoter. The efficacy of dCA was studied in the bone marrow-liver-thymus (BLT) mouse model of HIV latency and persistence. Adding dCA to ART-suppressed mice systemically reduces viral mRNA in tissues. Moreover, dCA significantly delays and reduces viral rebound levels upon treatment interruption. Altogether, this work demonstrates the potential of block-and-lock cure strategies.

Abstract: Hair follicle stem cells play important roles in maintaining homeostasis and skin tissue self-renewal. Transit-amplifying cells represent the transition of cells from hair follicle stem cells into differentiated epidermal cells. Thus far, the signaling pathway and the molecular biological mechanism that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of hair follicle stem cells remain unclear. In this paper, we studied the relationship between β-catenin and c-myc during the process of the differentiation of hair follicle stem cells into transit-amplifying cells. Based on our results, the expression of β-catenin can activate the nuclear gene c-myc and regulate the expression of transit-amplifying cell markers K15, K19, a6-integrin and β1-integrin, indicating that β-catenin is involved in the transformation process from hair follicle stem cells to transit-amplifying cells and suggesting that β-catenin plays an important biological role in the induction of this differentiation process.

Abstract: The transcriptional activator AphB has been implicated in acid resistance and pathogenesis in the food borne pathogens Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio cholerae. To date, the full-length AphB crystal structure of V. cholerae has been determined and characterized by a tetrameric assembly of AphB consisting of a DNA binding domain and a regulatory domain (RD). Although acidic pH and low oxygen tension might be involved in the activation of AphB, it remains unknown which ligand or stimulus activates AphB at the molecular level. In this study, we determine the crystal structure of the AphB RD from V. vulnificus under aerobic conditions without modification at the conserved cysteine residue of the RD, even in the presence of the oxidizing agent cumene hydroperoxide. A cysteine to serine amino acid residue mutant RD protein further confirmed that the cysteine residue is not involved in sensing oxidative stress in vitro. Interestingly, an unidentified small molecule was observed in the inter-subdomain cavity in the RD when the crystal was incubated with cumene hydroperoxide molecules, suggesting a new ligand-binding site. In addition, we confirmed the role of AphB in acid tolerance by observing an aphB-dependent increase in cadC transcript level when V. vulnificus was exposed to acidic pH. Our study contributes to the understanding of the AphB molecular mechanism in the process of recognizing the host environment.

Abstract: Summary
In segmented tissues, anterior and posterior compartments represent independent morphogenetic domains, which are made of distinct lineages separated by boundaries. During dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo, specific “mixer cells” (MCs) are reprogrammed in a JNK-dependent manner to express the posterior determinant engrailed (en) and cross the segment boundary. Here, we show that JNK signaling induces de novo expression of en in the MCs through repression of Polycomb (Pc) and release of the en locus from the silencing PcG bodies. Whereas reprogramming occurs in MCs from all thoracic and abdominal segments, cell mixing is restricted to the central abdominal region. We demonstrate that this spatial control of MC remodeling depends on the antagonist activity of the Hox genes abdominal-A and Abdominal-B. Together, these results reveal an essential JNK/en/Pc/Hox gene regulatory network important in controlling both the plasticity of segment boundaries and developmental reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
TNF is an inflammatory cytokine that upon binding to its receptor, TNFR1, can drive cytokine production, cell survival, or cell death. TNFR1 stimulation causes activation of NF-κB, p38α, and its downstream effector kinase MK2, thereby promoting transcription, mRNA stabilization, and translation of target genes. Here we show that TNF-induced activation of MK2 results in global RIPK1 phosphorylation. MK2 directly phosphorylates RIPK1 at residue S321, which inhibits its ability to bind FADD/caspase-8 and induce RIPK1-kinase-dependent apoptosis and necroptosis. Consistently, a phospho-mimetic S321D RIPK1 mutation limits TNF-induced death. Mechanistically, we find that phosphorylation of S321 inhibits RIPK1 kinase activation. We further show that cytosolic RIPK1 contributes to complex-II-mediated cell death, independent of its recruitment to complex-I, suggesting that complex-II originates from both RIPK1 in complex-I and cytosolic RIPK1. Thus, MK2-mediated phosphorylation of RIPK1 serves as a checkpoint within the TNF signaling pathway that integrates cell survival and cytokine production.

Abstract: Summary
Previous autonomous pattern-formation models often assumed complex molecular and cellular networks. This theoretical study, however, shows that a system composed of one substrate with multisite phosphorylation and a pair of kinase and phosphatase can generate autonomous spatial information, including complex stripe patterns. All (de-)phosphorylation reactions are described with a generic Michaelis-Menten scheme, and all species freely diffuse without pre-existing gradients. Computational simulation upon >23,000,000 randomly generated parameter sets revealed the design motifs of cyclic reaction and enzyme sequestration by slow-diffusing substrates. These motifs constitute short-range positive and long-range negative feedback loops to induce Turing instability. The width and height of spatial patterns can be controlled independently by distinct reaction-diffusion processes. Therefore, multisite reversible post-translational modification can be a ubiquitous source for various patterns without requiring other complex regulations such as autocatalytic regulation of enzymes and is applicable to molecular mechanisms for inducing subcellular localization of proteins driven by post-translational modifications.

Abstract: Summary
During embryonic development of the cerebellum, Purkinje cells (PCs) migrate away from the ventricular zone to form the PC plate. The mechanisms that regulate PC migration are incompletely understood. Here, we report that the neurotrophic receptor GFRα1 is transiently expressed in developing PCs and loss of GFRα1 delays PC migration. Neither GDNF nor RET, the canonical GFRα1 ligand and co-receptor, respectively, contribute to this process. Instead, we found that the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM is co-expressed and directly interacts with GFRα1 in embryonic PCs. Genetic reduction of NCAM expression enhances wild-type PC migration and restores migration in Gfra1 mutants, indicating that NCAM restricts PC migration in the embryonic cerebellum. In vitro experiments indicated that GFRα1 can function both in cis and trans to counteract NCAM and promote PC migration. Collectively, our studies show that GFRα1 contributes to PC migration by limiting NCAM function.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell-based therapy for type 1 diabetes would benefit from implementation of a cell purification step at the pancreatic endoderm stage. This would increase the safety of the final cell product, allow the establishment of an intermediate-stage stem cell bank, and provide a means for upscaling β cell manufacturing. Comparative gene expression analysis revealed glycoprotein 2 (GP2) as a specific cell surface marker for isolating pancreatic endoderm cells (PECs) from differentiated hESCs and human fetal pancreas. Isolated GP2+ PECs efficiently differentiated into glucose responsive insulin-producing cells in vitro. We found that in vitro PEC proliferation declines due to enhanced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN2A. However, we identified a time window when reducing CDKN1A or CDKN2A expression increased proliferation and yield of GP2+ PECs. Altogether, our results contribute tools and concepts toward the isolation and use of PECs as a source for the safe production of hPSC-derived β cells.

Abstract: Summary
Isogenic cells in a common environment show substantial cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, often referred to as “expression noise.” Here, we use multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets to identify features associated with high or low expression noise in mouse embryonic stem cells. These include the core promoter architecture of a gene, with CpG island promoters and a TATA box associated with low and high noise, respectively. High noise is also associated with “conflicting” chromatin states—the absence of transcription-associated histone modifications or the presence of repressive ones in active genes. Genes regulated by pluripotency factors through super-enhancers show high and correlated expression variability, consistent with fluctuations in the pluripotent state. Together, our results provide an integrated view of how core promoters, chromatin, regulation, and pluripotency fluctuations contribute to the variability of gene expression across individual stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating-type switching is initiated by a double-strand break (DSB) at MATa, leaving one cut end perfectly homologous to the HMLα donor, while the second end must be processed to remove a non-homologous tail before completing repair by gene conversion (GC). When homology at the matched end is ≤150 bp, efficient repair depends on the recombination enhancer, which tethers HMLα near the DSB. Thus, homology shorter than an apparent minimum efficient processing segment can be rescued by tethering the donor near the break. When homology at the second end is ≤150 bp, second-end capture becomes inefficient and repair shifts from GC to break-induced replication (BIR). But when pol32 or pif1 mutants block BIR, GC increases 3-fold, indicating that the steps blocked by these mutations are reversible. With short second-end homology, absence of the RecQ helicase Sgs1 promotes gene conversion, whereas deletion of the FANCM-related Mph1 helicase promotes BIR.

Abstract: The uncoupling protein 4 (ucp-4) gene is involved in age-dependent neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying the association between mitochondrial uncoupling and neurodegeneration by examining the effects of uncoupling agents and ucp-4 overexpression in C. elegans. Treatment with either DNP or CCCP improved neuronal defects in wild type during aging. Uncoupling agents also restored neuronal phenotypes of ucp-4 mutants to those exhibited by wild type, while ucp-4 overexpression attenuated the severity of age-dependent neurodegeneration. Neuronal improvements were further associated with reductions in mitochondrial membrane potentials. However, these age-dependent neuroprotective effects were limited in mitophagy-deficient mutant, pink-1, background. These results suggest that membrane uncoupling can attenuate age-dependent neurodegeneration by stimulating mitophagy.

Abstract: Summary
The hangover gene defines a cellular stress pathway that is required for rapid ethanol tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster. To understand how cellular stress changes neuronal function, we analyzed Hangover function on a cellular and neuronal level. We provide evidence that Hangover acts as a nuclear RNA binding protein and we identified the phosphodiesterase 4d ortholog dunce as a target RNA. We generated a transcript-specific dunce mutant that is impaired not only in ethanol tolerance but also in the cellular stress response. At the neuronal level, Dunce and Hangover are required in the same neuron pair to regulate experience-dependent motor output. Within these neurons, two cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent mechanisms balance the degree of tolerance. The balance is achieved by feedback regulation of Hangover and dunce transcript levels. This study provides insight into how nuclear Hangover/RNA signaling is linked to the cytoplasmic regulation of cAMP levels and results in neuronal adaptation and behavioral changes.

Abstract: Summary
Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited polyneuropathies. Mutations in 80 genetic loci can cause forms of CMT, resulting in demyelination and axonal dysfunction. The clinical presentation, including sensory deficits, distal muscle weakness, and atrophy, can vary greatly in severity and progression. Here, we used mouse models of CMT to demonstrate genetic interactions that result in a more severe neuropathy phenotype. The cell adhesion molecule Nrcam and the Na+ channel Scn8a (NaV1.6) are important components of nodes. Homozygous Nrcam and heterozygous Scn8a mutations synergized with both an Sh3tc2 mutation, modeling recessive demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4C, and mutations in Gars, modeling dominant axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2D. We conclude that genetic variants perturbing the structure and function of nodes interact with mutations affecting the cable properties of axons by thinning myelin or reducing axon diameter. Therefore, genes integral to peripheral nodes are candidate modifiers of peripheral neuropathy.

Abstract: Summary
The small ventral lateral neurons (sLNvs) constitute a central circadian pacemaker in the Drosophila brain. They organize daily locomotor activity, partly through the release of the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), coordinating the action of the remaining clusters required for network synchronization. Despite extensive efforts, the basic principles underlying communication among circadian clusters remain obscure. We identified classical neurotransmitters released by sLNvs through disruption of specific transporters. Adult-specific RNAi-mediated downregulation of the glycine transporter or impairment of glycine synthesis in LNv neurons increased period length by nearly an hour without affecting rhythmicity of locomotor activity. Electrophysiological recordings showed that glycine reduces spiking frequency in circadian neurons. Interestingly, downregulation of glycine receptor subunits in specific sLNv targets impaired rhythmicity, revealing involvement of glycine in information processing within the network. These data identify glycinergic inhibition of specific targets as a cue that contributes to the synchronization of the circadian network.

Abstract: Summary
Sirtuin-1 deacetylates proteins and has emerged as a critical regulator of different cellular processes, particularly inflammation. Basal SIRT1 activity was previously found to limit Th9 and enhance Th17 differentiation in mice, but the effect of pharmacological SIRT1 activation on T cell differentiation and antitumor responses remains unclear. Here, we find that SIRT1 pharmacological agonists selectively impede mouse and human Th17 cell differentiation. SIRT1 activation induces STAT3 deacetylation, thus reducing its ability to translocate into the nucleus, bind to Rorc promoter, and induce its transcription. SIRT1 agonists reduce tumor growth in mice by blocking Th17 cell differentiation. In cancer patients, the SIRT1 agonist metformin reduced the frequency of Th17 cells and STAT3 acetylation levels. Altogether, these data underscore that SIRT1 activation impedes Th17 cell differentiation and thereby limits tumor growth and suggest that SIRT1 activators may directly target IL-17A functions.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mammalian brain serve as a reservoir for the generation of new neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize adult NSC populations and examine the molecular identities and heterogeneity of in vivo NSC populations. We find that cells in the NSC lineage exist on a continuum through the processes of activation and differentiation. Interestingly, rare intermediate states with distinct molecular profiles can be identified and experimentally validated, and our analysis identifies putative surface markers and key intracellular regulators for these subpopulations of NSCs. Finally, using the power of single-cell profiling, we conduct a meta-analysis to compare in vivo NSCs and in vitro cultures, distinct fluorescence-activated cell sorting strategies, and different neurogenic niches. These data provide a resource for the field and contribute to an integrative understanding of the adult NSC lineage.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a method for primary culture of a well differentiated electrically tight rabbit vocal fold epithelial cell multilayer and the measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) for the evaluation of epithelial barrier function in vitro. Rabbit larynges were harvested and enzymatically treated to isolate vocal fold epithelial cells and to establish primary culture. Vocal fold epithelial cells were co-cultured with mitomycin C-treated feeder cells on collagen-coated plates. After 10–14 days in primary culture, cells were passaged and cultured until they achieved 70–90% confluence on collagen-coated plates. Epithelial cells were then passaged onto collagen-coated cell culture inserts using 4.5cm2 membrane filters (1.0μm pore size) with 10% fetal bovine serum or 30μg/mL bovine pituitary extract to investigate the effects of growth-promoting additives on TEER. Additional experiments were performed to investigate optimal seeding density (1.1, 2.2, 4.4, or 8.9×105 cells/cm2), the effect of co-culture with feeder cells, and the effect of passage number on epithelial barrier function. Characterization of in vitro cultures was performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunostaining for vocal fold epithelial cell markers and tight junctions. Results revealed higher TEER in cells supplemented with fetal bovine serum compared to bovine pituitary extract. TEER was highest in cells passaged at a seeding density of 2.2×104 cells/cm2, and TEER was higher in cells at passage two than passage three. Ultrastructural experiments revealed a well-differentiated epithelial cell multilayer, expressing the epithelial cell markers CK13, CK14 and the tight junction proteins occludin and ZO-1.

Abstract: Summary
During pancreatic development, proliferating pancreatic progenitors activate the proendocrine transcription factor neurogenin 3 (NEUROG3), exit the cell cycle, and differentiate into islet cells. The mechanisms that direct robust NEUROG3 expression within a subset of progenitor cells control the size of the endocrine population. Here we demonstrate that NEUROG3 is phosphorylated within the nucleus on serine 183, which catalyzes its hyperphosphorylation and proteosomal degradation. During progression through the progenitor cell cycle, NEUROG3 phosphorylation is driven by the actions of cyclin-dependent kinases 2 and 4/6 at G1/S cell-cycle checkpoint. Using models of mouse and human pancreas development, we show that lengthening of the G1 phase of the pancreatic progenitor cell cycle is essential for proper induction of NEUROG3 and initiation of endocrine cell differentiation. In sum, these studies demonstrate that progenitor cell-cycle G1 lengthening, through its actions on stabilization of NEUROG3, is an essential variable in normal endocrine cell genesis.

Abstract: Summary
Linker histones associate with nucleosomes to promote the formation of higher-order chromatin structure, but the underlying molecular details are unclear. We investigated the structure of a 197 bp nucleosome bearing symmetric 25 bp linker DNA arms in complex with vertebrate linker histone H1. We determined electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) and crystal structures of unbound and H1-bound nucleosomes and validated these structures by site-directed protein cross-linking and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments. Histone H1 shifts the conformational landscape of the nucleosome by drawing the two linkers together and reducing their flexibility. The H1 C-terminal domain (CTD) localizes primarily to a single linker, while the H1 globular domain contacts the nucleosome dyad and both linkers, associating more closely with the CTD-distal linker. These findings reveal that H1 imparts a strong degree of asymmetry to the nucleosome, which is likely to influence the assembly and architecture of higher-order structures.

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) degrades mRNAs containing a premature termination codon (PTC). PTCs are a frequent cause of human genetic diseases, and the NMD pathway is known to modulate disease severity. Since partial NMD attenuation can potentially enhance nonsense suppression therapies, better definition of human-specific NMD is required. However, the majority of NMD factors were first discovered in model organisms and then subsequently identified by homology in human. Sensitivity and throughput limitations of existing approaches have hindered systematic forward genetic screening for NMD factors in human cells. We developed a method of in vivo amplification of NMD reporter fluorescence (Fireworks) that enables CRISPR-based forward genetic screening for NMD pathway defects in human cells. The Fireworks genetic screen identifies multiple known NMD factors and numerous human candidate genes, providing a platform for discovery of additional key factors in human mRNA degradation.

Abstract: Summary
Naive pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) utilize both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to satisfy their metabolic demands. However, it is unclear how somatic cells acquire this hybrid energy metabolism during reprogramming toward naive pluripotency. Here, we show that when transduced with Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSK) into murine fibroblasts, Zic3 and Esrrb synergistically enhance the reprogramming efficiency by regulating cellular metabolic pathways. These two transcription factors (TFs) cooperatively activate glycolytic metabolism independently of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs). In contrast, the regulatory modes of the TFs on OXPHOS are antagonistic: Zic3 represses OXPHOS, whereas Esrrb activates it. Therefore, when introduced with Zic3, Esrrb restores OXPHOS activity, which is essential for efficient reprogramming. In addition, Esrrb-mediated OXPHOS activation is critical for the conversion of primed PSCs into the naive state. Our study suggests that the combinatorial function of TFs achieves an appropriate balance of metabolic pathways to induce naive PSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The induction of tumor suppressor proteins capable of cancer cell apoptosis represents an attractive option for the re-purposing of existing drugs. We report that the anti-malarial drug, chloroquine (CQ), is a robust inducer of Par-4 secretion from normal cells in mice and cancer patients in a clinical trial. CQ-inducible Par-4 secretion triggers paracrine apoptosis of cancer cells and also inhibits metastatic tumor growth. CQ induces Par-4 secretion via the classical secretory pathway that requires the activation of p53. Mechanistically, p53 directly induces Rab8b, a GTPase essential for vesicle transport of Par-4 to the plasma membrane prior to secretion. Our findings indicate that CQ induces p53- and Rab8b-dependent Par-4 secretion from normal cells for Par-4-dependent inhibition of metastatic tumor growth.

Abstract: Summary
Chlamydia trachomatis is a human pathogen associated with significant morbidity worldwide. As obligate intracellular parasites, chlamydiae must survive within eukaryotic cells for sufficient time to complete their developmental cycle. To promote host cell survival, chlamydiae express poorly understood anti-apoptotic factors. Using recently developed genetic tools, we show that three inclusion membrane proteins (Incs) out of eleven examined are required for inclusion membrane stability and avoidance of host cell death pathways. In the absence of specific Incs, premature inclusion lysis results in recognition by autophagolysosomes, activation of intrinsic apoptosis, and premature termination of the chlamydial developmental cycle. Inhibition of autophagy or knockdown of STING prevented host cell death and activation of intrinsic apoptosis. Significantly, these findings emphasize the importance of Incs in the establishment of a replicative compartment that sequesters the pathogen from host surveillance systems.

Abstract: Summary
Interaction networks between chromatin complexes and long noncoding RNAs have become a recurrent theme in epigenetic regulation. However, technical limitations have precluded identification of RNA binding motifs for chromatin-associated proteins. Here, we add a denaturation step to UV-crosslink RNA immunoprecipitation (dCLIP) and apply dCLIP to mouse and human chromobox homolog 7 (CBX7), an RNA binding subunit of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). In both species, CBX7 predominantly binds 3′ UTRs of messenger RNAs. CBX7 binds with a median RNA “footprint” of 171–183 nucleotides, the small size of which facilitates motif identification by bioinformatics. We find four families of consensus RNA motifs in mouse, and independent analysis of human CBX7 dCLIP data identifies similar motifs. Their mutation abolishes CBX7 binding in vitro. Pharmacological intervention with antisense oligonucleotides paradoxically increases CBX7 binding and enhances gene expression. These data support the utility of dCLIP and reveal an unexpected functional interaction between CBX7 and the 3′ UTRs of mRNA.

Abstract: Summary
The endothelial cytoskeleton is a barrier for leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM). Mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes generate gaps of similar micron-scale size when squeezing through inflamed endothelial barriers in vitro and in vivo. To elucidate how leukocytes squeeze through these barriers, we co-tracked the endothelial actin filaments and leukocyte nuclei in real time. Nuclear squeezing involved either preexistent or de novo-generated lobes inserted into the leukocyte lamellipodia. Leukocyte nuclei reversibly bent the endothelial actin stress fibers. Surprisingly, formation of both paracellular gaps and transcellular pores by squeezing leukocytes did not require Rho kinase or myosin II-mediated endothelial contractility. Electron-microscopic analysis suggested that nuclear squeezing displaced without condensing the endothelial actin filaments. Blocking endothelial actin turnover abolished leukocyte nuclear squeezing, whereas increasing actin filament density did not. We propose that leukocyte nuclei must disassemble the thin endothelial actin filaments interlaced between endothelial stress fibers in order to complete TEM.

Abstract: Summary
Long-term studies of Caenorhabditis elegans larval development traditionally require tedious manual observations because larvae must move to develop, and existing immobilization techniques either perturb development or are unsuited for young larvae. Here, we present a simple microfluidic device to simultaneously follow development of ten C. elegans larvae at high spatiotemporal resolution from hatching to adulthood (∼3 days). Animals grown in microchambers are periodically immobilized by compression to allow high-quality imaging of even weak fluorescence signals. Using the device, we obtain cell-cycle statistics for C. elegans vulval development, a paradigm for organogenesis. We combine Nomarski and multichannel fluorescence microscopy to study processes such as cell-fate specification, cell death, and transdifferentiation throughout post-embryonic development. Finally, we generate time-lapse movies of complex neural arborization through automated image registration. Our technique opens the door to quantitative analysis of time-dependent phenomena governing cellular behavior during C. elegans larval development.

Abstract: Summary
Commissural axons must cross the midline to form functional midline circuits. In the invertebrate nerve cord and vertebrate spinal cord, midline crossing is mediated in part by Netrin-dependent chemoattraction. Loss of crossing, however, is incomplete in mutants for Netrin or its receptor Frazzled/DCC, suggesting the existence of additional pathways. We identified the transmembrane Semaphorin, Sema-1a, as an important regulator of midline crossing in the Drosophila CNS. We show that in response to the secreted Semaphorins Sema-2a and Sema-2b, Sema-1a functions as a receptor to promote crossing independently of Netrin. In contrast to other examples of reverse signaling where Sema1a triggers repulsion through activation of Rho in response to Plexin binding, in commissural neurons Sema-1a acts independently of Plexins to inhibit Rho to promote attraction to the midline. These findings suggest that Sema-1a reverse signaling can elicit distinct axonal responses depending on differential engagement of distinct ligands and signaling effectors.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we describe a multiplexed immunohistochemical platform with computational image processing workflows, including image cytometry, enabling simultaneous evaluation of 12 biomarkers in one formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue section. To validate this platform, we used tissue microarrays containing 38 archival head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and revealed differential immune profiles based on lymphoid and myeloid cell densities, correlating with human papilloma virus status and prognosis. Based on these results, we investigated 24 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas from patients who received neoadjuvant GVAX vaccination and revealed that response to therapy correlated with degree of mono-myelocytic cell density and percentages of CD8+ T cells expressing T cell exhaustion markers. These data highlight the utility of in situ immune monitoring for patient stratification and provide digital image processing pipelines to the community for examining immune complexity in precious tissue sections, where phenotype and tissue architecture are preserved to improve biomarker discovery and assessment.

Abstract: Summary
Protein responses to extracellular cues are governed by gene transcription, mRNA degradation and translation, and protein degradation. In order to understand how these time-dependent processes cooperate to generate dynamic responses, we analyzed the response of human mammary cells to the epidermal growth factor (EGF). Integrating time-dependent transcript and protein data into a mathematical model, we inferred for several proteins their pre-and post-stimulus translation and degradation coefficients and found that they exhibit complex, time-dependent variation. Specifically, we identified strategies of protein production and degradation acting in concert to generate rapid, transient protein bursts in response to EGF. Remarkably, for some proteins, for which the response necessitates rapidly decreased abundance, cells exhibit a transient increase in the corresponding degradation coefficient. Our model and analysis allow inference of the kinetics of mRNA translation and protein degradation, without perturbing cells, and open a way to understanding the fundamental processes governing time-dependent protein abundance profiles.

Abstract: Summary
Current worldwide figures suggest that obesity is pandemic. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms would help develop viable anti-obesity therapies. Here, we assess the influence of obesity-induced inflammation on white adipocyte cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling, which is beneficial for adipocyte differentiation and thermogenesis. We find that murine gonadal and not inguinal fat is prone to obesity-induced inflammation. Correspondingly, the cGMP cascade is dysregulated in gonadal but not in inguinal fat of obese mice. Analysis of two independent human cohorts reveals a defective cGMP pathway only in visceral fat of obese subjects. Congruently, cGMP signaling is dysregulated in tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-treated primary white adipocytes. TNF-α-mediated suppression of sGCβ1 is mediated via NF-κB, whereas PKG is repressed by JNK signaling. Additionally, TNF-α-activated JNK signaling suppresses PPARγ and aP2. Taken together, the intensity of obesity-induced inflammation dictates the amplitude of cGMP signaling dysregulation in white adipocytes through distinct pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Senescence is a proliferation arrest that can result from a variety of stresses. Cancer cells can also undergo senescence, but the stresses that provoke cancer cells to undergo senescence are unclear. Here, we use both functional genetic and compound screens in cancer cells harboring a reporter that is activated during senescence to find targets that induce senescence. We show that suppression of the SWI/SNF component SMARCB1 induces senescence in melanoma through strong activation of the MAP kinase pathway. From the compound screen, we identified multiple aurora kinase inhibitors as potent inducers of senescence in RAS mutant lung cancer. Senescent melanoma and lung cancer cells acquire sensitivity to the BCL2 family inhibitor ABT263. We propose a one-two punch approach for the treatment of cancer in which a drug is first used to induce senescence in cancer cells and a second drug is then used to kill senescent cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Investigation of human CNS disease and drug effects has been hampered by the lack of a system that enables single-cell analysis of live adult patient brain cells. We developed a culturing system, based on a papain-aided procedure, for resected adult human brain tissue removed during neurosurgery. We performed single-cell transcriptomics on over 300 cells, permitting identification of oligodendrocytes, microglia, neurons, endothelial cells, and astrocytes after 3 weeks in culture. Using deep sequencing, we detected over 12,000 expressed genes, including hundreds of cell-type-enriched mRNAs, lncRNAs and pri-miRNAs. We describe cell-type- and patient-specific transcriptional hierarchies. Single-cell transcriptomics on cultured live adult patient derived cells is a prime example of the promise of personalized precision medicine. Because these cells derive from subjects ranging in age into their sixties, this system permits human aging studies previously possible only in rodent systems.

Abstract: Summary
RhoA-mediated regulation of myosin-II activity in the actin cortex controls the ability of cells to contract and bleb during a variety of cellular processes, including cell migration and division. Cell contraction and blebbing also frequently occur as part of the cytopathic effect seen during many different viral infections. We now demonstrate that the vaccinia virus protein F11, which localizes to the plasma membrane, is required for ROCK-mediated cell contraction from 2 hr post infection. Curiously, F11-induced cell contraction is dependent on RhoC and not RhoA signaling to ROCK. Moreover, RhoC-driven cell contraction depends on the upstream inhibition of RhoD signaling by F11. This inhibition prevents RhoD from regulating its downstream effector Pak6, alleviating the suppression of RhoC by the kinase. Our observations with vaccinia have now demonstrated that RhoD recruits Pak6 to the plasma membrane to antagonize RhoC signaling during cell contraction and blebbing.

Abstract: Summary
Compared with follicular lymphoma, high PI3Kα expression was more prevalent in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), although both tumor types expressed substantial PI3Kδ. Simultaneous inhibition of PI3Kα and PI3Kδ dramatically enhanced the anti-tumor profile in ABC-DLBCL models compared with selective inhibition of PI3Kδ, PI3Kα, or BTK. The anti-tumor activity was associated with suppression of p-AKT and a mechanism of blocking nuclear factor-κB activation driven by CD79mut, CARD11mut, TNFAIP3mut, or MYD88mut. Inhibition of PI3Kα/δ resulted in tumor regression in an ibrutinib-resistant CD79BWT/MYD88mut patient-derived ABC-DLBCL model. Furthermore, rebound activation of BTK and AKT was identified as a mechanism limiting CD79Bmut-ABC-DLBCL to show a robust response to PI3K and BTK inhibitor monotherapies. A combination of ibrutinib with the PI3Kα/δ inhibitor copanlisib produced a sustained complete response in vivo in CD79Bmut/MYD88mut ABC-DLBCL models.

Abstract: Summary
Circadian clocks regulate various aspects of photoreceptor physiology, but their contribution to photoreceptor development and function is unclear. Cone photoreceptors are critical for color vision. Here, we define the molecular function of circadian activity within cone photoreceptors and reveal a role for the clock genes Bmal1 and Per2 in regulating cone spectral identity. ChIP analysis revealed that BMAL1 binds to the promoter region of the thyroid hormone (TH)-activating enzyme type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) and thus regulates the expression of Dio2. TH treatment resulted in a partial rescue of the phenotype caused by the loss of Bmal1, thus revealing a functional relationship between Bmal1 and Dio2 in establishing cone photoreceptor identity. Furthermore, Bmal1 and Dio2 are required to maintain cone photoreceptor functional integrity. Overall, our results suggest a mechanism by which circadian proteins can locally regulate the availability of TH and influence tissue development and function.

Abstract: Summary
Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) elicits hunger responses to increase the chances of surviving starvation: an inhibition of metabolism and an increase in feeding. Here we elucidate a key central circuit mechanism through which hypothalamic NPY signals drive these hunger responses. GABAergic neurons in the intermediate and parvicellular reticular nuclei (IRt/PCRt) of the medulla oblongata, which are activated by NPY-triggered neural signaling from the hypothalamus, potentially through the nucleus tractus solitarius, mediate the NPY-induced inhibition of metabolic thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) via their innervation of BAT sympathetic premotor neurons. Intriguingly, the GABAergic IRt/PCRt neurons innervating the BAT sympathetic premotor region also innervate the masticatory motor region, and stimulation of the IRt/PCRt elicits mastication and increases feeding as well as inhibits BAT thermogenesis. These results indicate that GABAergic IRt/PCRt neurons mediate hypothalamus-derived hunger signaling by coordinating both autonomic and feeding motor systems to reduce energy expenditure and to promote feeding.

Abstract: Summary
As an important regulator of macrophage cholesterol efflux and HDL biogenesis, miR-33 is a promising target for treatment of atherosclerosis, and numerous studies demonstrate that inhibition of miR-33 increases HDL levels and reduces plaque burden. However, important questions remain about how miR-33 impacts atherogenesis, including whether this protection is primarily due to direct effects on plaque macrophages or regulation of lipid metabolism in the liver. We demonstrate that miR-33 deficiency in Ldlr−/− mice promotes obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia but does not impact plaque development. We further assess how loss of miR-33 or addition of miR-33b in macrophages and other hematopoietic cells impact atherogenesis. Macrophage-specific loss of miR-33 decreases lipid accumulation and inflammation under hyperlipidemic conditions, leading to reduced plaque burden. Therefore, the pro-atherogenic effects observed in miR-33-deficient mice are likely counterbalanced by protective effects in macrophages, which may be the primary mechanism through which anti-miR-33 therapies reduce atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor EB (TFEB) is an essential component of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy for the adaptive response to food deprivation. To address the physiological function of TFEB in skeletal muscle, we have used muscle-specific gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Here, we show that TFEB controls metabolic flexibility in muscle during exercise and that this action is independent of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator1α (PGC1α). Indeed, TFEB translocates into the myonuclei during physical activity and regulates glucose uptake and glycogen content by controlling expression of glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, and pathways related to glucose homeostasis. In addition, TFEB induces the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. This coordinated action optimizes mitochondrial substrate utilization, thus enhancing ATP production and exercise capacity. These findings identify TFEB as a critical mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of defined cancers is crucial for effective personalized therapies. Translocations of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene produce fusion proteins such as MLL-AF4 that disrupt epigenetic pathways and cause poor-prognosis leukemias. Here, we find that at a subset of gene targets, MLL-AF4 binding spreads into the gene body and is associated with the spreading of Menin binding, increased transcription, increased H3K79 methylation (H3K79me2/3), a disruption of normal H3K36me3 patterns, and unmethylated CpG regions in the gene body. Compared to other H3K79me2/3 marked genes, MLL-AF4 spreading gene expression is downregulated by inhibitors of the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L. This sensitivity mediates synergistic interactions with additional targeted drug treatments. Therefore, epigenetic spreading and enhanced susceptibility to epidrugs provides a potential marker for better understanding combination therapies in humans.

Abstract: Summary
N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) represents the most prevalent internal modification in mammalian mRNAs. Despite its functional importance in various fundamental bioprocesses, the studies of m6A in cancer have been limited. Here we show that FTO, as an m6A demethylase, plays a critical oncogenic role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FTO is highly expressed in AMLs with t(11q23)/MLL rearrangements, t(15;17)/PML-RARA, FLT3-ITD, and/or NPM1 mutations. FTO enhances leukemic oncogene-mediated cell transformation and leukemogenesis, and inhibits all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced AML cell differentiation, through regulating expression of targets such as ASB2 and RARA by reducing m6A levels in these mRNA transcripts. Collectively, our study demonstrates the functional importance of the m6A methylation and the corresponding proteins in cancer, and provides profound insights into leukemogenesis and drug response.

Abstract: Intracellular calcium release is essential for regulating almost all cellular functions. Specific spatio-temporal patterns of cytosolic calcium elevations are critical determinants of cell fate in response to pro-apoptotic cellular stressors. As the apoptotic program can take hours or days, measurement of long-term calcium dynamics are essential for understanding the mechanistic role of calcium in apoptotic cell death. Due to the technical limitations of using calcium-sensitive dyes to measure cytosolic calcium little is known about long-term calcium dynamics in living cells after treatment with apoptosis-inducing drugs. Genetically encoded calcium indicators could potentially overcome some of the limitations of calcium-sensitive dyes. Here, we compared the performance of the genetically encoded calcium indicators GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f with the ratiometric dye Fura-2. GCaMP6s performed as well or better than Fura-2 in detecting agonist-induced calcium transients. We then examined the utility of GCaMP6s for continuously measuring apoptotic calcium release over the course of ten hours after treatment with staurosporine. We found that GCaMP6s was suitable for measuring apoptotic calcium release over long time courses and revealed significant heterogeneity in calcium release dynamics in individual cells challenged with staurosporine. Our results suggest GCaMP6s is an excellent indicator for monitoring long-term changes cytosolic calcium during apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
It is increasingly appreciated that alternative splicing plays a key role in generating functional specificity and diversity in cancer. However, the mechanisms by which cancer mutations perturb splicing remain unknown. Here, we developed a network-based strategy, DrAS-Net, to investigate more than 2.5 million variants across cancer types and link somatic mutations with cancer-specific splicing events. We identified more than 40,000 driver variant candidates and their 80,000 putative splicing targets deregulated in 33 cancer types and inferred their functional impact. Strikingly, tumors with splicing perturbations show reduced expression of immune system-related genes and increased expression of cell proliferation markers. Tumors harboring different mutations in the same gene often exhibit distinct splicing perturbations. Further stratification of 10,000 patients based on their mutation-splicing relationships identifies subtypes with distinct clinical features, including survival rates. Our work reveals how single-nucleotide changes can alter the repertoires of splicing isoforms, providing insights into oncogenic mechanisms for precision medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Intravasation, active entry of cancer cells into the circulation, is often considered to be a relatively late event in tumor development occurring after stromal invasion. Here, we provide evidence that intravasation can be initiated early during tumor development and proceed in parallel to or independent of tumor invasion into surrounding stroma. By applying direct and unbiased intravasation-scoring methods to two histologically distinct human cancer types in live-animal models, we demonstrate that intravasation takes place almost exclusively within the tumor core, involves intratumoral vasculature, and does not involve vasculotropic cancer cells invading tumor-adjacent stroma and migrating along tumor-converging blood vessels. Highlighting an additional role for EGFR in cancer, we find that EGFR is required for the development of an intravasation-sustaining intratumoral vasculature. Intratumoral localization of intravasation supports the notion that overt metastases in cancer patients could be initiated much earlier during cancer progression than appreciated within conventional clinical tumor staging systems.

Abstract: Summary
Meiosis consists of DNA replication followed by two consecutive nuclear divisions and gametogenesis or spore formation. While meiosis I has been studied extensively, less is known about the regulation of meiosis II. Here we show that Hrr25, the conserved casein kinase 1δ of budding yeast, links three mutually independent key processes of meiosis II. First, Hrr25 induces nuclear division by priming centromeric cohesin for cleavage by separase. Hrr25 simultaneously phosphorylates Rec8, the cleavable subunit of cohesin, and removes from centromeres the cohesin protector composed of shugoshin and the phosphatase PP2A. Second, Hrr25 initiates the sporulation program by inducing the synthesis of membranes that engulf the emerging nuclei at anaphase II. Third, Hrr25 mediates exit from meiosis II by activating pathways that trigger the destruction of M-phase-promoting kinases. Thus, Hrr25 synchronizes formation of the single-copy genome with gamete differentiation and termination of meiosis.

Abstract: Summary
Androgen deprivation therapy is the most effective treatment for advanced prostate cancer, but almost all cancer eventually becomes castration resistant, and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that an intrinsic constitutively activated feedforward signaling circuit composed of IκBα/NF-κB(p65), miR-196b-3p, Meis2, and PPP3CC is formed during the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This circuit controls the expression of stem cell transcription factors that drives the high tumorigenicity of CRPC cells. Interrupting the circuit by targeting its individual components significantly impairs the tumorigenicity and CRPC development. Notably, constitutive activation of IκBα/NF-κB(p65) in this circuit is not dependent on the activation of traditional IKKβ/NF-κB pathways that are important in normal immune responses. Therefore, our studies present deep insight into the bona fide mechanisms underlying castration resistance and provide the foundation for the development of CRPC therapeutic strategies that would be highly efficient while avoiding indiscriminate IKK/NF-κB inhibition in normal cells.

Abstract: Summary
Drug combinations are synergistic when their combined efficacy exceeds the sum of the individual actions, but they rarely include ineffective drugs that become effective only in combination. We identified several “enabling pairs” of neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-ebolavirus monoclonal antibodies, whose combination exhibited new functional profiles, including transforming a non-neutralizing antibody to a neutralizer. Sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies 2G4 or m8C4 enabled non-neutralizing antibody FVM09 (IC50 >1 μM) to exhibit potent neutralization (IC50 1–10 nM). While FVM09 or m8C4 alone failed to protect Ebola-virus-infected mice, a combination of the two antibodies provided 100% protection. Furthermore, non-neutralizers FVM09 and FVM02 exponentially enhanced the potency of two neutralizing antibodies against both Ebola and Sudan viruses. We identified a hotspot for the binding of these enabling antibody pairs near the interface of the glycan cap and GP2. Enabling cooperativity may be an underappreciated phenomenon for viruses, with implications for the design and development of immunotherapeutics and vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic cell division is known to be controlled by the cyclin/cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) machinery. However, eukaryotes have evolved prior to CDKs, and cells can divide in the absence of major cyclin/CDK components. We hypothesized that an autonomous metabolic oscillator provides dynamic triggers for cell-cycle initiation and progression. Using microfluidics, cell-cycle reporters, and single-cell metabolite measurements, we found that metabolism of budding yeast is a CDK-independent oscillator that oscillates across different growth conditions, both in synchrony with and also in the absence of the cell cycle. Using environmental perturbations and dynamic single-protein depletion experiments, we found that the metabolic oscillator and the cell cycle form a system of coupled oscillators, with the metabolic oscillator separately gating and maintaining synchrony with the early and late cell cycle. Establishing metabolism as a dynamic component within the cell-cycle network opens new avenues for cell-cycle research and therapeutic interventions for proliferative disorders.

Abstract: Adipose tissue plays a central role in regulating dynamic crosstalk between tissues and organs. A detailed description of molecules that are differentially expressed upon changes in adipose tissue mass is expected to increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie obesity and related metabolic co-morbidities. Our previous studies suggest a possible link between endophilins (SH3Grb2 proteins) and changes in body weight. To explore this further, we sought to assess the distribution of endophilin A2 (EA2) in human adipose tissue and experimental animals. Human paired adipose tissue samples (subcutaneous and visceral) were collected from subjects undergoing elective abdominal surgery and abdominal liposuction. We observed elevated EA2 gene expression in the subcutaneous compared to that in the visceral human adipose tissue. EA2 gene expression negatively correlated with adiponectin and chemerin in visceral adipose tissue, and positively correlated with TNF-α in subcutaneous adipose tissue. EA2 gene expression was significantly downregulated during differentiation of preadipocytes in vitro. In conclusion, this study provides a description of EA2 distribution and emphasizes a need to study the roles of this protein during the progression of obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria play an integral role in cell death, autophagy, immunity, and inflammation. We previously showed that Nur77, an orphan nuclear receptor, induces apoptosis by targeting mitochondria. Here, we report that celastrol, a potent anti-inflammatory pentacyclic triterpene, binds Nur77 to inhibit inflammation and induce autophagy in a Nur77-dependent manner. Celastrol promotes Nur77 translocation from the nucleus to mitochondria, where it interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), a scaffold protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase important for inflammatory signaling. The interaction is mediated by an LxxLL motif in TRAF2 and results not only in the inhibition of TRAF2 ubiquitination but also in Lys63-linked Nur77 ubiquitination. Under inflammatory conditions, ubiquitinated Nur77 resides at mitochondria, rendering them sensitive to autophagy, an event involving Nur77 interaction with p62/SQSTM1. Together, our results identify Nur77 as a critical intracellular target for celastrol and unravel a mechanism of Nur77-dependent clearance of inflamed mitochondria to alleviate inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Most ribosomal proteins (RP) are regarded as essential, static components that contribute only to ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. However, emerging evidence suggests that RNA-binding RP are dynamic and can influence cellular processes by performing “extraribosomal,” regulatory functions involving binding to select critical target mRNAs. We report here that the RP, Rpl22, and its highly homologous paralog Rpl22-Like1 (Rpl22l1 or Like1) play critical, extraribosomal roles in embryogenesis. Indeed, they antagonistically control morphogenesis through developmentally regulated localization to the nucleus, where they modulate splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding smad2, an essential transcriptional effector of Nodal/TGF-β signaling. During gastrulation, Rpl22 binds to intronic sequences of smad2 pre-mRNA and induces exon 9 skipping in cooperation with hnRNP-A1. This action is opposed by its paralog, Like1, which promotes exon 9 inclusion in the mature transcript. The nuclear roles of these RP in controlling morphogenesis represent a fundamentally different and paradigm-shifting mode of action for RP.

Abstract: Summary
The study of enhancers has been hampered by the scarcity of methods to systematically quantify their endogenous activity. We develop Mosaic-seq to systematically perturb enhancers and measure their endogenous activities at single-cell resolution. Mosaic-seq uses a CRISPR barcoding system to jointly measure a cell’s transcriptome and its sgRNA modulators, thus quantifying the effects of dCas9-KRAB-mediated enhancer repression in single cells. Applying Mosaic-seq to 71 constituent enhancers from 15 super-enhancers, our analysis of 51,448 sgRNA-induced transcriptomes finds that only a small number of constituents are major effectors of target gene expression. Binding of p300 and RNAPII are key features of these constituents. We determine two key parameters of enhancer activity in single cells: their penetrance in a population and their contribution to expression in these cells. Through combinatorial interrogation, we find that simultaneous repression of multiple weak constituents can alter super-enhancer activity in a manner greatly exceeding repression of individual constituents.

Abstract: Summary
During immune challenge, T lymphocytes engage pathways of anabolic metabolism to support clonal expansion and the development of effector functions. Here we report a critical role for the non-essential amino acid serine in effector T cell responses. Upon activation, T cells upregulate enzymes of the serine, glycine, one-carbon (SGOC) metabolic network, and rapidly increase processing of serine into one-carbon metabolism. We show that extracellular serine is required for optimal T cell expansion even in glucose concentrations sufficient to support T cell activation, bioenergetics, and effector function. Restricting dietary serine impairs pathogen-driven expansion of T cells in vivo, without affecting overall immune cell homeostasis. Mechanistically, serine supplies glycine and one-carbon units for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis in proliferating T cells, and one-carbon units from formate can rescue T cells from serine deprivation. Our data implicate serine as a key immunometabolite that directly modulates adaptive immunity by controlling T cell proliferative capacity.

Abstract: Summary
During development and regeneration, matrix progenitors undergo terminal differentiation to form the concentric layers of the hair follicle. These differentiation events are thought to require signals from the mesenchymal dermal papilla (DP); however, it remains unclear how DP-progenitor cell interactions govern specific cell fate decisions. Here, we show that the hair follicle differentiated layers are specified asynchronously, with early matrix progenitors initiating differentiation before surrounding the DP. Furthermore, these early matrix cells can undergo terminal differentiation in the absence of Shh, BMP signaling, and DP maturation. Whereas early matrix progenitors form the hair follicle companion layer, later matrix populations progressively form the inner root sheath and hair shaft. Altogether, our findings characterize some of the earliest terminal differentiation events in the hair follicle and reveal that the matrix progenitor pool can be divided into early and late phases based on distinct temporal, molecular, and functional characteristics.

Abstract: Summary
Surgery remains the most successful curative treatment for cancer. However, some patients with early-stage disease who undergo surgery eventually succumb to distant metastasis. Here, we show that in response to surgery, the lungs become more vulnerable to metastasis due to extracellular matrix remodeling. Mice that undergo surgery or that are preconditioned with plasma from donor mice that underwent surgery succumb to lung metastases earlier than controls. Increased lysyl oxidase (LOX) activity and expression, fibrillary collagen crosslinking, and focal adhesion signaling contribute to this effect, with the hypoxic surgical site serving as the source of LOX. Furthermore, the lungs of recipient mice injected with plasma from post-surgical colorectal cancer patients are more prone to metastatic seeding than mice injected with baseline plasma. Downregulation of LOX activity or levels reduces lung metastasis after surgery and increases survival, highlighting the potential of LOX inhibition in reducing the risk of metastasis following surgery.

Abstract: Summary
Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) is an inherited disorder of lipoprotein metabolism resulting from mutations in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP). In addition to expression in the liver and intestine, MTTP is expressed in cardiomyocytes, and cardiomyopathy has been reported in several ABL cases. Using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from an ABL patient homozygous for a missense mutation (MTTPR46G), we show that human hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes exhibit defects associated with ABL disease, including loss of apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion and intracellular accumulation of lipids. MTTPR46G iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes failed to secrete apoB, accumulated intracellular lipids, and displayed increased cell death, suggesting intrinsic defects in lipid metabolism due to loss of MTTP function. Importantly, these phenotypes were reversed after the correction of the MTTPR46G mutation by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Together, these data reveal clear cellular defects in iPSC-derived hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes lacking MTTP activity, including a cardiomyocyte-specific regulated stress response to elevated lipids.

Abstract: Summary
Protein synthesis is the most energy-consuming process in a proliferating cell, and understanding what controls protein abundances represents a key question in biology and biotechnology. We quantified absolute abundances of 5,354 mRNAs and 2,198 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under ten environmental conditions and protein turnover for 1,384 proteins under a reference condition. The overall correlation between mRNA and protein abundances across all conditions was low (0.46), but for differentially expressed proteins (n = 202), the median mRNA-protein correlation was 0.88. We used these data to model translation efficiencies and found that they vary more than 400-fold between genes. Non-linear regression analysis detected that mRNA abundance and translation elongation were the dominant factors controlling protein synthesis, explaining 61% and 15% of its variance. Metabolic flux balance analysis further showed that only mitochondrial fluxes were positively associated with changes at the transcript level. The present dataset represents a crucial expansion to the current resources for future studies on yeast physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing contributes to gene expression dynamics in many tissues, yet its role in auditory development remains unclear. We performed whole-exome sequencing in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and identified pathogenic mutations in Epithelial Splicing-Regulatory Protein 1 (ESRP1). Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells showed alternative splicing defects that were restored upon repair of an ESRP1 mutant allele. To determine how ESRP1 mutations cause hearing loss, we evaluated Esrp1−/− mouse embryos and uncovered alterations in cochlear morphogenesis, auditory hair cell differentiation, and cell fate specification. Transcriptome analysis revealed impaired expression and splicing of genes with essential roles in cochlea development and auditory function. Aberrant splicing of Fgfr2 blocked stria vascularis formation due to erroneous ligand usage, which was corrected by reducing Fgf9 gene dosage. These findings implicate mutations in ESRP1 as a cause of SNHL and demonstrate the complex interplay between alternative splicing, inner ear development, and auditory function.

Abstract: Summary
Targeting the tumor vasculature with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is a promising anti-cancer strategy that in order to be realized must overcome several obstacles, including identification of suitable targets and optimal warheads. Here, we demonstrate that the cell-surface protein CD276/B7-H3 is broadly overexpressed by multiple tumor types on both cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating blood vessels, making it a potentially ideal dual-compartment therapeutic target. In preclinical studies CD276 ADCs armed with a conventional MMAE warhead destroyed CD276-positive cancer cells, but were ineffective against tumor vasculature. In contrast, pyrrolobenzodiazepine-conjugated CD276 ADCs killed both cancer cells and tumor vasculature, eradicating large established tumors and metastases, and improving long-term overall survival. CD276-targeted dual-compartment ablation could aid in the development of highly selective broad-acting anti-cancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Gastric acid secretion by parietal cells requires trafficking and exocytosis of H/K-ATPase-rich tubulovesicles (TVs) toward apical membranes in response to histamine stimulation via cyclic AMP elevation. Here, we found that TRPML1 (ML1), a protein that is mutated in type IV mucolipidosis (ML-IV), is a tubulovesicular channel essential for TV exocytosis and acid secretion. Whereas ML-IV patients are reportedly achlorhydric, transgenic overexpression of ML1 in mouse parietal cells induced constitutive acid secretion. Gastric acid secretion was blocked and stimulated by ML1 inhibitors and agonists, respectively. Organelle-targeted Ca2+ imaging and direct patch-clamping of apical vacuolar membranes revealed that ML1 mediates a PKA-activated conductance on TV membranes that is required for histamine-induced Ca2+ release from TV stores. Hence, we demonstrated that ML1, acting as a Ca2+ channel in TVs, links transmitter-initiated cyclic nucleotide signaling with Ca2+-dependent TV exocytosis in parietal cells, providing a regulatory mechanism that could be targeted to manage acid-related gastric diseases.

Abstract: The β2 integrins are cell surface transmembrane proteins regulating leukocyte functions, such as adhesion and migration. Two members of β2 integrin, αMβ2 and αXβ2, share the leukocyte distribution profile and integrin αXβ2 is involved in antigen presentation in dendritic cells and transendothelial migration of monocytes and macrophages to atherosclerotic lesions. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a member of cell adhesion molecules, plays an important role in chronic inflammation and atherosclerosis. Although RAGE and αXβ2 play an important role in inflammatory response and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the nature of their interaction and structure involved in the binding remain poorly defined. In this study, using I-domain as a ligand binding motif of αXβ2, we characterize the binding nature and the interacting moieties of αX I-domain and RAGE. Their binding requires divalent cations (Mg2+ and Mn2+) and shows an affinity on the sub-micro molar level: the dissociation constant of αX I-domains binding to RAGE being 0.49 μM. Furthermore, the αX I-domains recognize the V-domain, but not the C1 and C2-domains of RAGE. The acidic amino acid substitutions on the ligand binding site of αX I-domain significantly reduce the I-domain binding activity to soluble RAGE and the alanine substitutions of basic amino acids on the flat surface of the V-domain prevent the V-domain binding to αX I-domain. In conclusion, the main mechanism of αX I-domain binding to RAGE is a charge interaction, in which the acidic moieties of αX I-domains, including E244, and D249, recognize the basic residues on the RAGE V-domain encompassing K39, K43, K44, R104, and K107.

Abstract: Summary
During embryogenesis, neural progenitors in the ganglionic eminences give rise to diverse GABAergic interneuron subtypes that populate all forebrain regions. The extent to which these cells are genetically predefined or determined by postmigratory environmental cues remains unknown. To address this question, we performed homo- and heterotopic transplantation of early postnatal MGE-derived cortical and hippocampal interneurons. Grafted cells migrated, and displayed neurochemical, electrophysiological, morphological, and neurochemical profiles similar to endogenous interneurons. Our results indicate that the host environment regulates the proportion of interneuron classes in the brain region. However, some specific interneuron subtypes retain characteristics representative of their donor brain regions.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates signals from growth factors and nutrients to control biosynthetic processes, including protein, lipid, and nucleic acid synthesis. We find that the mTORC1 pathway is responsive to changes in purine nucleotides in a manner analogous to its sensing of amino acids. Depletion of cellular purines, but not pyrimidines, inhibits mTORC1, and restoration of intracellular adenine nucleotides via addition of exogenous purine nucleobases or nucleosides acutely reactivates mTORC1. Adenylate sensing by mTORC1 is dependent on the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein complex and its regulation of Rheb upstream of mTORC1, but independent of energy stress and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Even though mTORC1 signaling is not acutely sensitive to changes in intracellular guanylates, long-term depletion of guanylates decreases Rheb protein levels. Our findings suggest that nucleotide sensing, like amino acid sensing, enables mTORC1 to tightly coordinate nutrient availability with the synthesis of macromolecules, such as protein and nucleic acids, produced from those nutrients.

Abstract: Summary
Loss-of-function mutations in SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling subunit genes are observed in many cancers, but an oncogenic role for SWI/SNF is not well established. Here, we reveal that ACTL6A, encoding an SWI/SNF subunit linked to stem cell and progenitor cell function, is frequently co-amplified and highly expressed together with the p53 family member p63 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). ACTL6A and p63 physically interact, cooperatively controlling a transcriptional program that promotes proliferation and suppresses differentiation, in part through activation of the Hippo-YAP pathway via regulators including WWC1. Ectopic ACTL6A/p63 expression promotes tumorigenesis, while ACTL6A expression and YAP activation are highly correlated in primary HNSCC and predict poor patient survival. Thus, ACTL6A and p63 collaborate as oncogenic drivers in HNSCC.

Abstract: Summary
Cold and other environmental factors induce “browning” of white fat depots—development of beige adipocytes with morphological and functional resemblance to brown fat. Similar to brown fat, beige adipocytes are assumed to express mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and are thermogenic due to the UCP1-mediated H+ leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, this assumption has never been tested directly. Herein we patch clamped the inner mitochondrial membrane of beige and brown fat to provide a direct comparison of their thermogenic H+ leak (IH). All inguinal beige adipocytes had robust UCP1-dependent IH comparable to brown fat, but it was about three times less sensitive to purine nucleotide inhibition. Strikingly, only ∼15% of epididymal beige adipocytes had IH, while in the rest UCP1-dependent IH was undetectable. Despite the absence of UCP1 in the majority of epididymal beige adipocytes, these cells employ prominent creatine cycling as a UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disease, but genetically defined models can provide an entry point to studying the molecular underpinnings of this disorder. We generated germline mutant mice with loss-of-function mutations in Chd8, a de novo mutation strongly associated with ASD, and demonstrate that these mice display hallmark ASD behaviors, macrocephaly, and craniofacial abnormalities similar to patient phenotypes. Chd8+/– mice display a broad, brain-region-specific dysregulation of major regulatory and cellular processes, most notably histone and chromatin modification, mRNA and protein processing, Wnt signaling, and cell-cycle regulation. We also find altered synaptic physiology in medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens. Perturbation of Chd8 in adult mice recapitulates improved acquired motor learning behavior found in Chd8+/– animals, suggesting a role for CHD8 in adult striatal circuits. These results support a mechanism linking chromatin modification to striatal dysfunction and the molecular pathology of ASD.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factors play a key role in the development of diverse cancers, and therapeutically targeting them has remained a challenge. In prostate cancer, the gene encoding the transcription factor ERG is recurrently rearranged and plays a critical role in prostate oncogenesis. Here, we identified a series of peptides that interact specifically with the DNA binding domain of ERG. ERG inhibitory peptides (EIPs) and derived peptidomimetics bound ERG with high affinity and specificity, leading to proteolytic degradation of the ERG protein. The EIPs attenuated ERG-mediated transcription, chromatin recruitment, protein-protein interactions, cell invasion and proliferation, and tumor growth. Thus, peptidomimetic targeting of transcription factor fusion products may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer as well as other malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Evolution repeatedly converges on only a few regulatory circuit designs that achieve a given function. This simplicity helps us understand biological networks. However, why so few circuits are rediscovered by evolution is unclear. We address this question for the case of fold-change detection (FCD): a response to relative changes of input rather than absolute changes. Two types of FCD circuits recur in biological systems—the incoherent feedforward and non-linear integral-feedback loops. We performed an analytical screen of all three-node circuits in a class comprising ∼500,000 topologies. We find that FCD is rare, but still there are hundreds of FCD topologies. The two experimentally observed circuits are among the very few minimal circuits that optimally trade off speed, noise resistance, and response amplitude. This suggests a way to understand why evolution converges on only few topologies for a given function and provides FCD designs for synthetic construction and future discovery.

Abstract: Summary
The proper location and timing of Dnmt1 activation are essential for DNA methylation maintenance. We demonstrate here that Dnmt1 utilizes two-mono-ubiquitylated histone H3 as a unique ubiquitin mark for its recruitment to and activation at DNA methylation sites. The crystal structure of the replication foci targeting sequence (RFTS) of Dnmt1 in complex with H3-K18Ub/23Ub reveals striking differences to the known ubiquitin-recognition structures. The two ubiquitins are simultaneously bound to the RFTS with a combination of canonical hydrophobic and atypical hydrophilic interactions. The C-lobe of RFTS, together with the K23Ub surface, also recognizes the N-terminal tail of H3. The binding of H3-K18Ub/23Ub results in spatial rearrangement of two lobes in the RFTS, suggesting the opening of its active site. Actually, incubation of Dnmt1 with H3-K18Ub/23Ub increases its catalytic activity in vitro. Our results therefore shed light on the essential role of a unique ubiquitin-binding module in DNA methylation maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Evidence suggests that altered gut microbiota composition may be involved in the development of obesity. Studies using mice made obese with refined high-fat diets have supported this; however, these have commonly used chow as a control diet, introducing confounding factors from differences in dietary composition that have a key role in shaping microbiota composition. We compared the effects of feeding a refined high-fat diet with those of feeding either a refined low-fat diet or a chow diet on gut microbiota composition and host physiology. Feeding both refined low- or high-fat diets resulted in large alterations in the gut microbiota composition, intestinal fermentation, and gut morphology, compared to a chow diet. However, body weight, body fat, and glucose intolerance only increased in mice fed the refined high-fat diet. The choice of control diet can dissociate broad changes in microbiota composition from obesity, raising questions about the previously proposed relationship between gut microbiota and obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Cells exposed to hypoxia experience replication stress but do not accumulate DNA damage, suggesting sustained DNA replication. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is the only enzyme capable of de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). However, oxygen is an essential cofactor for mammalian RNR (RRM1/RRM2 and RRM1/RRM2B), leading us to question the source of dNTPs in hypoxia. Here, we show that the RRM1/RRM2B enzyme is capable of retaining activity in hypoxia and therefore is favored over RRM1/RRM2 in order to preserve ongoing replication and avoid the accumulation of DNA damage. We found two distinct mechanisms by which RRM2B maintains hypoxic activity and identified responsible residues in RRM2B. The importance of RRM2B in the response to tumor hypoxia is further illustrated by correlation of its expression with a hypoxic signature in patient samples and its roles in tumor growth and radioresistance. Our data provide mechanistic insight into RNR biology, highlighting RRM2B as a hypoxic-specific, anti-cancer therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Aneuploidy is a hallmark of cancer, although its effects on tumorigenesis are unclear. Here, we investigated the relationship between aneuploidy and cancer development using cells engineered to harbor single extra chromosomes. We found that nearly all trisomic cell lines grew poorly in vitro and as xenografts, relative to genetically matched euploid cells. Moreover, the activation of several oncogenic pathways failed to alleviate the fitness defect induced by aneuploidy. However, following prolonged growth, trisomic cells acquired additional chromosomal alterations that were largely absent from their euploid counterparts and that correlated with improved fitness. Thus, while single-chromosome gains can suppress transformation, the genome-destabilizing effects of aneuploidy confer an evolutionary flexibility that may contribute to the aggressive growth of advanced malignancies with complex karyotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Within the gastrointestinal stem cell niche, nerves help to regulate both normal and neoplastic stem cell dynamics. Here, we reveal the mechanisms underlying the cancer-nerve partnership. We find that Dclk1+ tuft cells and nerves are the main sources of acetylcholine (ACh) within the gastric mucosa. Cholinergic stimulation of the gastric epithelium induced nerve growth factor (NGF) expression, and in turn NGF overexpression within gastric epithelium expanded enteric nerves and promoted carcinogenesis. Ablation of Dclk1+ cells or blockade of NGF/Trk signaling inhibited epithelial proliferation and tumorigenesis in an ACh muscarinic receptor-3 (M3R)-dependent manner, in part through suppression of yes-associated protein (YAP) function. This feedforward ACh-NGF axis activates the gastric cancer niche and offers a compelling target for tumor treatment and prevention.
