Abstract: Summary
Whole-body regeneration requires the ability to produce the full repertoire of adult cell types. The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea contains over 125 cell types, which can be regenerated from a stem cell population called neoblasts. Neoblast fate choice can be regulated by the expression of fate-specific transcription factors (FSTFs). How fate choices are made and distributed across neoblasts versus their post-mitotic progeny remains unclear. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to systematically map fate choices made in S/G2/M neoblasts and, separately, in their post-mitotic progeny that serve as progenitors for all adult cell types. We defined transcription factor expression signatures associated with all detected fates, identifying numerous new progenitor classes and FSTFs that regulate them. Our work generates an atlas of stem cell fates with associated transcription factor signatures for most cell types in a complete adult organism.

Abstract: Summary
The comprehensive genomic impact of ionizing radiation (IR), a carcinogen, on healthy somatic cells remains unclear. Using large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of clones expanded from irradiated murine and human single cells, we revealed that IR induces a characteristic spectrum of short insertions or deletions (indels) and structural variations (SVs), including balanced inversions, translocations, composite SVs (deletion-insertion, deletion-inversion, and deletion-translocation composites), and complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs), including chromoplexy, chromothripsis, and SV by breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Our findings suggest that 1 Gy IR exposure causes an average of 2.33 mutational events per Gb genome, comprising 2.15 indels, 0.17 SVs, and 0.01 CGRs, despite a high level of inter-cellular stochasticity. The mutational burden was dependent on total irradiation dose, regardless of dose rate or cell type. The findings were further validated in IR-induced secondary cancers and single cells without clonalization. Overall, our study highlights a comprehensive and clear picture of IR effects on normal mammalian genomes.

Abstract: Summary
SWI/SNF complexes are evolutionarily conserved, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling machines. Here, we characterize the features of SWI/SNF-dependent genes using BRM014, an inhibitor of the ATPase activity of the complexes. We find that SWI/SNF activity is required to maintain chromatin accessibility and nucleosome occupancy for most enhancers but not for most promoters. SWI/SNF activity is needed for expression of genes with low to medium levels of expression that have promoters with (1) low chromatin accessibility, (2) low levels of active histone marks, (3) high H3K4me1/H3K4me3 ratio, (4) low nucleosomal phasing, and (5) enrichment in TATA-box motifs. These promoters are mostly occupied by the canonical Brahma-related gene 1/Brahma-associated factor (BAF) complex. These genes are surrounded by SWI/SNF-dependent enhancers and mainly encode signal transduction, developmental, and cell identity genes (with almost no housekeeping genes). Machine-learning models trained with different chromatin characteristics of promoters and their surrounding regulatory regions indicate that the chromatin landscape is a determinant for establishing SWI/SNF dependency.

Abstract: Pomacea canaliculata is an invasive snail species causing major problems in agriculture. The snail biology was then investigated. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the nervous system of the snail. The nervous system comprises pairs of cerebral, buccal, pedal, pleural, parietal ganglia and an unpaired visceral ganglion. Most neurons were concentrated at the periphery of the ganglia. The neurons were classified into four types: NR1, NR2, NR3, and NR4. The percentages of the NR3 and NR4 in the pleural and pedal ganglia were significantly higher than those of other ganglia. Ultrastructural study revealed that nuclei of all neuronal types exhibited mostly euchromatins. Many organelles including ribosomes and endoplasmic reticulum were found in their cytoplasm. However, various mitochondria were found in the NR2 and NR3. The immunohistochemistry revealed immunoreactivity of ghrelin-like peptide in the neurons of the cerebral, pleural and pedal ganglia. However, immunoreactivity of GHS-R1a-like peptide existed only in the neurons of the pleural and pedal ganglia. The present study is the first to demonstrate the existence of ghrelin-like peptide and its receptor in P. canaliculata nervous system.

Abstract: Summary
An intriguing effect of short-term caloric restriction (CR) is the expansion of certain stem cell populations, including muscle stem cells (satellite cells), which facilitate an accelerated regenerative program after injury. Here, we utilized the MetRSL274G (MetRS) transgenic mouse to identify liver-secreted plasminogen as a candidate for regulating satellite cell expansion during short-term CR. Knockdown of circulating plasminogen prevents satellite cell expansion during short-term CR. Furthermore, loss of the plasminogen receptor KT (Plg-RKT) is also sufficient to prevent CR-related satellite cell expansion, consistent with direct signaling of plasminogen through the plasminogen receptor Plg-RKT/ERK kinase to promote proliferation of satellite cells. Importantly, we are able to replicate many of these findings in human participants from the CALERIE trial. Our results demonstrate that CR enhances liver protein secretion of plasminogen, which signals directly to the muscle satellite cell through Plg-RKT to promote proliferation and subsequent muscle resilience during CR.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies have elucidated Nr5a2’s role in activating zygotic genes during early mouse embryonic development. Subsequent research, however, reveals that Nr5a2 is not critical for zygotic genome activation but is vital for the gene program between the 4- and 8-cell stages. A significant gap exists in experimental evidence regarding its function during the first lineage differentiation’s pivotal period. In this study, we observed that approximately 20% of embryos developed to the blastocyst stage following Nr5a2 ablation. However, these blastocysts lacked inner cell mass (ICM), highlighting Nr5a2’s importance in first lineage differentiation. Mechanistically, using RNA sequencing and CUT&Tag, we found that Nr5a2 transcriptionally regulates ICM-specific genes, such as Oct4, to establish the pluripotent network. Interference with or overexpression of Nr5a2 in single blastomeres of 2-cell embryos can alter the fate of daughter cells. Our results indicate that Nr5a2 works as a doorkeeper to ensure ICM formation in mouse blastocyst.

Abstract: Summary
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate gene expression and innate immunity. Previously, we showed that HDAC5 is degraded during Vaccinia virus (VACV) infection and is a restriction factor for VACV and herpes simplex virus type 1. Here, we report that HDAC5 promotes interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation downstream of Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor molecule-1 or Sendai virus-mediated stimulation without requiring HDAC activity. Loss of HDAC5-mediated IRF3 activation is restored by re-introduction of HDAC5 but not HDAC1 or HDAC4. The antiviral activity of HDAC5 is antagonized by VACV protein C6 and orthologs from the orthopoxviruses cowpox, rabbitpox, camelpox, monkeypox, and variola. Infection by many of these viruses induces proteasomal degradation of HDAC5, and expression of C6 alone can induce HDAC5 degradation. Mechanistically, C6 binds to the dimerization domain of HDAC5 and prevents homodimerization and heterodimerization with HDAC4. Overall, this study describes HDAC5 as a positive regulator of IRF3 activation and provides mechanistic insight into how the poxviral protein C6 binds to HDAC5 to antagonize its function.

Abstract: Summary
Programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD ligand-1 (PD-L1)-mediated immune escape contributes to cancer development and has been targeted as an anti-cancer strategy. Here, we show that inhibition of the RNA helicase DDX3 increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in syngeneic oral squamous cell carcinoma tumors. DDX3 knockdown compromised interferon-γ-induced PD-L1 expression and, in particular, reduced the level of cell-surface PD-L1. DDX3 promoted surface PD-L1 expression by recruiting the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex to the 3′ UTR of PD-L1 mRNA. DDX3 depletion or 3′ UTR truncation increased the binding of the coatomer protein complexes to PD-L1, leading to its intracellular accumulation. Therefore, this 3′ UTR-dependent mechanism may counteract cellular negative effects on surface trafficking of PD-L1. Finally, pharmaceutic disruption of DDX3’s interaction with AP2 reduced surface PD-L1 expression, supporting that the DDX3-AP2 pathway routes PD-L1 to the cell surface. Targeting DDX3 to modulate surface trafficking of immune checkpoint proteins may provide a potential strategy for cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) represent a group of metabolic conditions that cause severe developmental defects. Peroxisomes are essential metabolic organelles, present in virtually every eukaryotic cell and mediating key processes in immunometabolism. To date, the full spectrum of PBDs remains to be identified, and the impact PBDs have on immune function is unexplored. This study presents a characterization of the hepatic immune compartment of a neonatal PBD mouse model at single-cell resolution to establish the importance and function of peroxisomes in developmental hematopoiesis. We report that hematopoietic defects are a feature in a severe PBD murine model. Finally, we identify a role for peroxisomes in the regulation of the major histocompatibility class II expression and antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells in dendritic cells. This study adds to our understanding of the mechanisms of PBDs and expands our knowledge of the role of peroxisomes in immunometabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Schlemm’s canal (SC) functions to maintain proper intraocular pressure (IOP) by draining aqueous humor and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for glaucoma, the second-leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. However, our current understanding of the mechanisms governing SC development and functionality remains limited. Here, we show that vitronectin (VTN) produced by limbal macrophages promotes SC formation and prevents intraocular hypertension by activating integrin αvβ3 signaling. Genetic inactivation of this signaling system inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO1 and reduced β-catenin activity and FOXC2 expression, thereby causing impaired Prox1 expression and deteriorated SC morphogenesis. This ultimately led to increased IOP and glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Intriguingly, we found that aged SC displayed downregulated integrin β3 in association with dampened Prox1 expression. Conversely, FOXO1 inhibition rejuvenated the aged SC by inducing Prox1 expression and SC regrowth, highlighting a possible strategy by targeting VTN/integrin αvβ3 signaling to improve SC functionality.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the mechanisms underlying cytotoxic immunoglobulin G (IgG) activity is critical for improving therapeutic antibody activity and inhibiting autoantibody-mediated tissue pathology. While prior research highlights the important role of the mononuclear phagocytic system for removing opsonized target cells, it remains unclear which monocyte or macrophage subsets stemming from fetal or post-natal bone-marrow (BM)-associated definitive hematopoiesis are involved in target cell depletion. By using a titrated irradiation approach as well as Kupffer-cell-specific deletion of activated Fcγ receptor signaling, we establish conditions under which the contribution of BM-derived monocytes versus yolk-sac-derived liver-resident macrophages to cytotoxic IgG activity can be studied. Our results demonstrate that liver-resident macrophages originating from either fetal or adult hematopoiesis play a central role in IgG-mediated depletion of opsonized target cells from the peripheral blood under steady-state conditions, highlighting the impact of the tissue niche and not macrophage origin for cytotoxic antibody activity.

Abstract: Summary
Neural mechanisms underlying amputation-related secondary pain are unclear. Using in vivo two-photon imaging, three-dimensional reconstruction, and fiber photometry recording, we show that a microglial activation cascade from the primary somatosensory cortex of forelimb (S1FL) to the primary somatosensory cortex of hindlimb (S1HL) mediates the disinhibition and subsequent hyperexcitation of glutamatergic neurons in the S1HL (S1HLGlu), which then drives secondary mechanical hypersensitivity development in ipsilateral hindpaws of mice with forepaw amputation. Forepaw amputation induces rapid S1FL microglial activation that further activates S1HL microglia via the CCL2-CCR2 signaling pathway. Increased engulfment of GABAergic presynapses by activated microglia stimulates S1HLGlu neuronal activity, ultimately leading to secondary mechanical hypersensitivity of hindpaws. It is widely believed direct neuronal projection drives interactions between distinct brain regions to prime specific behaviors. Our study reveals microglial interactions spanning different subregions of the somatosensory cortex to drive a maladaptive neuronal response underlying secondary mechanical hypersensitivity at non-injured sites.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells exhibit dramatic differences in gene expression at the single-cell level, which can predict whether they become resistant to treatment. Treatment perpetuates this heterogeneity, resulting in a diversity of cell states among resistant clones. However, it remains unclear whether these differences lead to distinct responses when another treatment is applied or the same treatment is continued. In this study, we combined single-cell RNA sequencing with barcoding to track resistant clones through prolonged and sequential treatments. We found that cells within the same clone have similar gene expression states after multiple rounds of treatment. Moreover, we demonstrated that individual clones have distinct and differing fates, including growth, survival, or death, when subjected to a second treatment or when the first treatment is continued. By identifying gene expression states that predict clone survival, this work provides a foundation for selecting optimal therapies that target the most aggressive resistant clones within a tumor. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
The acquisition and performance of goal-directed actions has long been argued to depend on the integration of glutamatergic inputs to the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) under the modulatory influence of dopamine. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about the dynamics of striatal dopamine during goal-directed actions. To investigate this, we chronically recorded dopamine release in the pDMS as rats acquired two actions for distinct outcomes as these action-outcome associations were incremented and then subsequently degraded or reversed. We found that bilateral dopamine release scaled with action value, whereas the lateralized dopamine signal, i.e., the difference in dopamine release ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the direction of the goal-directed action, reflected the strength of the action-outcome association independently of changes in movement. Our results establish, therefore, that striatal dopamine activity during goal-directed action reflects both bilateral moment-to-moment changes in action value and the long-term action-outcome association.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia-mediated synaptic plasticity after CNS injury varies depending on injury severity, but the mechanisms that adjust synaptic plasticity according to injury differences are largely unknown. This study investigates differential actions of microglia on essential spinal motor synaptic circuits following different kinds of nerve injuries. Following nerve transection, microglia and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 signaling permanently remove Ia axons and synapses from the ventral horn, degrading proprioceptive feedback during motor actions and abolishing stretch reflexes. However, Ia synapses and reflexes recover after milder injuries (nerve crush). These different outcomes are related to the length of microglia activation, being longer after nerve cuts, with slower motor-axon regeneration and extended expression of colony-stimulating factor type 1 in injured motoneurons. Prolonged microglia activation induces CCL2 expression, and Ia synapses recover after ccl2 is deleted from microglia. Thus, microglia Ia synapse removal requires the induction of specific microglia phenotypes modulated by nerve regeneration efficiencies. However, synapse preservation was not sufficient to restore the stretch-reflex function.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid droplets (LDs) are fat storage organelles critical for energy and lipid metabolism. Upon nutrient exhaustion, cells consume LDs via gradual lipolysis or via lipophagy, the en bloc uptake of LDs into the vacuole. Here, we show that LDs dock to the vacuolar membrane via a contact site that is required for lipophagy in yeast. The LD-localized LDO proteins carry an intrinsically disordered region that directly binds vacuolar Vac8 to form vCLIP, the vacuolar-LD contact site. Nutrient limitation drives vCLIP formation, and its inactivation blocks lipophagy, resulting in impaired caloric restriction-induced longevity. We establish a functional link between lipophagy and microautophagy of the nucleus, both requiring Vac8 to form respective contact sites upon metabolic stress. In sum, we identify the tethering machinery of vCLIP and find that Vac8 provides a platform for multiple and competing contact sites associated with autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
In the male mouse germ line, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), bound by the PIWI protein MIWI2 (PIWIL4), guide DNA methylation of young active transposons through SPOCD1. However, the underlying mechanisms of SPOCD1-mediated piRNA-directed transposon methylation and whether this pathway functions to protect the human germ line remain unknown. We identified loss-of-function variants in human SPOCD1 that cause defective transposon silencing and male infertility. Through the analysis of these pathogenic alleles, we discovered that the uncharacterized protein C19ORF84 interacts with SPOCD1. DNMT3C, the DNA methyltransferase responsible for transposon methylation, associates with SPOCD1 and C19ORF84 in fetal gonocytes. Furthermore, C19ORF84 is essential for piRNA-directed DNA methylation and male mouse fertility. Finally, C19ORF84 mediates the in vivo association of SPOCD1 with the de novo methylation machinery. In summary, we have discovered a conserved role for the human piRNA pathway in transposon silencing and C19ORF84, an uncharacterized protein essential for orchestrating piRNA-directed DNA methylation.

Abstract: Summary
Exploration is typically motivated by gaining information, with previous research showing that potential information gains drive a “directed” type of exploration. Yet, this research usually studies exploration in the context of learning paradigms and does not directly manipulate multiple levels of information gain. Here, we present a task that isolates learning from decision-making and controls the magnitude of prospective information gains. As predicted, participants explore more with larger future information gains. Both value gains and information gains, at a trial-by-trial level, engage the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), the ventral striatum (VStr), the amygdala, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and the anterior insula (aINS). Moreover, individual sensitivities to value gains and information gains modulate the vmPFC, dACC, and aINS, but the amygdala and VStr are modulated only by individual sensitivities to information gains. Overall, we identify the neural circuitry of information-based exploration and its relationship with inter-individual exploration biases.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrantly slow ribosomes incur collisions, a sentinel of stress that triggers quality control, signaling, and translation attenuation. Although each collision response has been studied in isolation, the net consequences of their collective actions in reshaping translation in cells is poorly understood. Here, we apply cryoelectron tomography to visualize the translation machinery in mammalian cells during persistent collision stress. We find that polysomes are compressed, with up to 30% of ribosomes in helical polysomes or collided disomes, some of which are bound to the stress effector GCN1. The native collision interface extends beyond the in vitro-characterized 40S and includes the L1 stalk and eEF2, possibly contributing to translocation inhibition. The accumulation of unresolved tRNA-bound 80S and 60S and aberrant 40S configurations identifies potentially limiting steps in collision responses. Our work provides a global view of the translation machinery in response to persistent collisions and a framework for quantitative analysis of translation dynamics in situ.

Abstract: Summary
UFMylation is an emerging ubiquitin-like post-translational modification that regulates various biological processes. Dysregulation of the UFMylation pathway leads to human diseases, including cancers. However, the physiological role of UFMylation in T cells remains unclear. Here, we report that mice with conditional knockout (cKO) Ufl1, a UFMylation E3 ligase, in T cells exhibit effective tumor control. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis shows that tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are increased in Ufl1 cKO mice. Mechanistically, UFL1 promotes PD-1 UFMylation to antagonize PD-1 ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, AMPK phosphorylates UFL1 at Thr536, disrupting PD-1 UFMylation to trigger its degradation. Of note, UFL1 ablation in T cells reduces PD-1 UFMylation, subsequently destabilizing PD-1 and enhancing CD8+ T cell activation. Thus, Ufl1 cKO mice bearing tumors have a better response to anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy. Collectively, our findings uncover a crucial role of UFMylation in T cells and highlight UFL1 as a potential target for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity is a major effector of cell fate decisions. Whereas cell proliferation on stiff matrices, wherein Yes-associated protein (YAP) plays a pivotal role, is well documented, activation of apoptosis in response to soft matrices is poorly understood. Here, we show that YAP drives the apoptotic decision as well. We find that in cells on soft matrices, YAP is recruited to small adhesions, phosphorylated at the Y357 residue, and translocated into the nucleus, ultimately leading to apoptosis. In contrast, Y357 phosphorylation levels are dramatically low in large adhesions on stiff matrices. Furthermore, mild attenuation of actomyosin contractility allows adhesion growth on soft matrices, leading to reduced Y357 phosphorylation levels and resulting in cell growth. These findings indicate that failed adhesion reinforcement drives rigidity-dependent apoptosis through YAP and that this decision is not determined solely by ECM rigidity but rather by the balance between cellular forces and ECM rigidity.

Abstract: Summary
The early limb bud consists of mesenchymal limb progenitors derived from the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). The LPM also gives rise to the mesodermal components of the flank and neck. However, the cells at these other levels cannot produce the variety of cell types found in the limb. Taking advantage of a direct reprogramming approach, we find a set of factors (Prdm16, Zbtb16, and Lin28a) normally expressed in the early limb bud and capable of imparting limb progenitor-like properties to mouse non-limb fibroblasts. The reprogrammed cells show similar gene expression profiles and can differentiate into similar cell types as endogenous limb progenitors. The further addition of Lin41 potentiates the proliferation of the reprogrammed cells. These results suggest that these same four factors may play pivotal roles in the specification of endogenous limb progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Unraveling the mechanisms governing the diversity of ecological communities is a central goal in ecology. Although microbial dispersal constitutes an important ecological process, the effect of dispersal on microbial diversity is poorly understood. Here, we sought to fill this gap by combining a generalized Lotka-Volterra model with experimental investigations. Our model showed that emigration increases the diversity of the community when the immigration rate crosses a defined threshold, which we identified as Ineutral. We also found that at high immigration rates, emigration weakens the relative abundance of fast-growing species and thus enhances the mass effect and increases the diversity. We experimentally confirmed this finding using co-cultures of 20 bacterial strains isolated from the soil. Our model further showed that Ineutral decreases with the increase of species pool size, growth rate, and interspecies interaction. Our work deepens the understanding of the effects of dispersal on the diversity of natural communities.

Abstract: Summary
Predicting the risk of cancer mutations is critical for early detection and prevention, but differences in allelic severity of human carriers confound risk predictions. Here, we elucidate protein folding as a cellular mechanism driving differences in mutation severity of tumor suppressor BRCA1. Using a high-throughput protein-protein interaction assay, we show that protein-folding chaperone binding patterns predict the pathogenicity of variants in the BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain. HSP70 selectively binds 94% of pathogenic BRCA1-BRCT variants, most of which engage HSP70 more than HSP90. Remarkably, the magnitude of HSP70 binding linearly correlates with loss of folding and function. We identify a prevalent class of human hypomorphic BRCA1 variants that bind moderately to chaperones and retain partial folding and function. Furthermore, chaperone binding signifies greater mutation penetrance and earlier cancer onset in the clinic. Our findings demonstrate the utility of chaperones as quantitative cellular biosensors of variant folding, phenotypic severity, and cancer risk.

Abstract: Summary
Germinal activity persists throughout life within the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) of the postnatal forebrain due to the presence of neural stem cells (NSCs). Accumulating evidence points to a recruitment for these cells following early brain injuries and suggests their amenability to manipulations. We used chronic hypoxia as a rodent model of early brain injury to investigate the reactivation of cortical progenitors at postnatal times. Our results reveal an increased proliferation and production of glutamatergic progenitors within the dorsal V-SVZ. Fate mapping of V-SVZ NSCs demonstrates their contribution to de novo cortical neurogenesis. Transcriptional analysis of glutamatergic progenitors shows parallel changes in methyltransferase 14 (Mettl14) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In agreement, manipulations through genetic and pharmacological activation of Mettl14 and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, respectively, induce neurogenesis and promote newly-formed cell maturation. Finally, labeling of young adult NSCs demonstrates that pharmacological NSC activation has no adverse effects on the reservoir of V-SVZ NSCs and on their germinal activity.

Abstract: Summary
Tight regulation of macrophage immune gene expression is required to fight infection without risking harmful inflammation. The contribution of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to shaping the macrophage response to pathogens remains poorly understood. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that a member of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of mRNA processing factors, SRSF7, is required for optimal expression of a cohort of interferon-stimulated genes in macrophages. Using genetic and biochemical assays, we discover that in addition to its canonical role in regulating alternative splicing, SRSF7 drives transcription of interferon regulatory transcription factor 7 (IRF7) to promote antiviral immunity. At the Irf7 promoter, SRSF7 maximizes STAT1 transcription factor binding and RNA polymerase II elongation via cooperation with the H4K20me1 histone methyltransferase KMT5a (SET8). These studies define a role for an SR protein in activating transcription and reveal an RBP-chromatin network that orchestrates macrophage antiviral gene expression.

Abstract: The current study was conducted to determine the precise mechanisms of Sirtuin-1 (Sirt-1), TGF- β (Transforming Growth Factor-β), and long non-coding RNA Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1 (LncRNA MALAT-1) in signaling pathways in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced nephrotoxicity. The potential therapeutic effect of Resveratrol and Pirfenidone in DOX toxicity was also assessed. Thirty-six male adult rats were evenly distributed into four groups: Group 1: control rats. Group 2: DOX exposed rats’ group, each animal received 7.5 mg/kg DOX as a single intravenous dose, Group 3: DOX exposed group subjected to oral resveratrol (20 mg/kg/daily for two weeks), Group 4: DOX exposed group subjected to oral Pirfenidone (200 mg/kg once daily for 10 days). At the planned time, animals were sacrificed. Renal tissue was collected to assess matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), inflammatory and apoptotic markers: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- β, caspase-3, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), and oxidative stress markers: nitric oxide (NO), Glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Sirtuin-1 (Sirt-1), TGF-β, and LncRNA MALAT-1 were quantitatively assessed by real-time RT-PCR in the whole blood. Results showed that the DOX group exhibited a significant increase in oxidative stress markers, and inflammatory, and apoptotic markers in the renal tissue. Histologically, the renal tubule lining cells exhibited vacuolar alterations in the cytoplasm, glomerular atrophy, and vascular congestion. Furthermore, renal degeneration was evident, as confirmed by the heightened immuno-expression of MMP9. Exposure to DOX resulted in a significant decrease in Sirtuin-1 (Sirt-1) with a significant increase in the TGFβ, and LncRNA MALAT-1 gene expression. However, pre-treatment with either resveratrol/or Pirefenidone ameliorated the histological renal alterations, regulated the pathways of Sirt-1, TGFβ, and LncRNA MALAT-1, and decreased all oxidative stress, inflammatory and apoptotic markers. In conclusion, DOX exposure leads to renal toxicity by inducing renal degeneration, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Administration of either resveratrol or Pirfenidone counteracted these changes and protected the kidney against DOX-induced renal damage.

Abstract: Summary
Autoinhibition is a prevalent allosteric regulatory mechanism in signaling proteins. Reduced autoinhibition underlies the tumorigenic effect of some known cancer drivers, but whether autoinhibition is altered generally in cancer remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that cancer-associated missense mutations, in-frame insertions/deletions, and fusion breakpoints are enriched within inhibitory allosteric switches (IASs) across all cancer types. Selection for IASs that are recurrently mutated in cancers identifies established and unknown cancer drivers. Recurrent missense mutations in IASs of these drivers are associated with distinct, cancer-specific changes in molecular signaling. For the specific case of PPP3CA, the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, we provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of altered autoinhibition by cancer mutations using biomolecular simulations, and demonstrate that such mutations are associated with transcriptome changes consistent with increased calcineurin signaling. Our integrative study shows that autoinhibition-modulating genetic alterations are positively selected for by cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression is influenced by immune suppression induced by leukemia cells. ZEB1, a critical transcription factor in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, demonstrates immune regulatory functions in AML. Silencing ZEB1 in leukemic cells reduces engraftment and extramedullary disease in immune-competent mice, activating CD8 T lymphocytes and limiting Th17 cell expansion. ZEB1 in AML cells directly promotes Th17 cell development that, in turn, creates a self-sustaining loop and a pro-invasive phenotype, favoring transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), interleukin-23 (IL-23), and SOCS2 gene transcription. In bone marrow biopsies from AML patients, immunohistochemistry shows a direct correlation between ZEB1 and Th17. Also, the analysis of ZEB1 expression in larger datasets identifies two distinct AML groups, ZEB1high and ZEB1low, each with specific immunological and molecular traits. ZEB1high patients exhibit increased IL-17, SOCS2, and TGF-β pathways and a negative association with overall survival. This unveils ZEB1’s dual role in AML, entwining pro-tumoral and immune regulatory capacities in AML blasts.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes are central to metabolic homeostasis. The microphthalmia bHLH-LZ transcription factors (MiT/TFEs) family members MITF, TFEB, and TFE3 promote the transcription of lysosomal and autophagic genes and are often deregulated in cancer. Here, we show that the GATOR2 complex, an activator of the metabolic regulator TORC1, maintains lysosomal function by protecting MiT/TFEs from proteasomal degradation independent of TORC1, GATOR1, and the RAG GTPase. We determine that in GATOR2 knockout HeLa cells, members of the MiT/TFEs family are ubiquitylated by a trio of E3 ligases and are degraded, resulting in lysosome dysfunction. Additionally, we demonstrate that GATOR2 protects MiT/TFE proteins in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma, two cancers that are driven by MiT/TFE hyperactivation. In summary, we find that the GATOR2 complex has independent roles in TORC1 regulation and MiT/TFE protein protection and thus is central to coordinating cellular metabolism with control of the lysosomal-autophagic system.

Abstract: Summary
Current base editors (BEs) use DNA deaminases, including cytidine deaminase in cytidine BE (CBE) or adenine deaminase in adenine BE (ABE), to facilitate transition nucleotide substitutions. Combining CBE or ABE with glycosylase enzymes can induce limited transversion mutations. Nonetheless, a critical demand remains for BEs capable of generating alternative mutation types, such as T>G corrections. In this study, we leveraged pre-trained protein language models to optimize a uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) variant with altered specificity for thymines (eTDG). Notably, after two rounds of testing fewer than 50 top-ranking variants, more than 50% exhibited over 1.5-fold enhancement in enzymatic activities. When eTDG was fused with nCas9, it induced programmable T-to-S (G/C) substitutions and corrected db/db diabetic mutation in mice (up to 55%). Our findings not only establish orthogonal strategies for developing novel BEs but also demonstrate the capacities of protein language models for optimizing enzymes without extensive task-specific training data.

Abstract: Summary
Striatal dopamine axons co-release dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), using GABA provided by uptake via GABA transporter-1 (GAT1). Functions of GABA co-release are poorly understood. We asked whether co-released GABA autoinhibits dopamine release via axonal GABA type A receptors (GABAARs), complementing established inhibition by dopamine acting at axonal D2 autoreceptors. We show that dopamine axons express α3-GABAAR subunits in mouse striatum. Enhanced dopamine release evoked by single-pulse optical stimulation in striatal slices with GABAAR antagonism confirms that an endogenous GABA tone limits dopamine release. Strikingly, an additional inhibitory component is seen when multiple pulses are used to mimic phasic axonal activity, revealing the role of GABAAR-mediated autoinhibition of dopamine release. This autoregulation is lost in conditional GAT1-knockout mice lacking GABA co-release. Given the faster kinetics of ionotropic GABAARs than G-protein-coupled D2 autoreceptors, our data reveal a mechanism whereby co-released GABA acts as a first responder to dampen phasic-to-tonic dopamine signaling.

This raises the question of whether other mechanisms are also involved in early host defense. Using transcriptome analysis of disrupted transcripts in herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected cells, we find that HSV infection disrupts the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription network in neurons and epithelial cells. Importantly, HIF activation leads to control of HSV replication. Mechanistically, HIF activation induces autophagy, which is essential for antiviral activity. HSV-2 infection in vivo leads to hypoxia in CNS neurons, and mice with neuron-specific HIF1/2α deficiency exhibit elevated viral load and augmented PRR signaling and inflammatory gene expression in the CNS after HSV-2 infection. Data from human stem cell-derived neuron and microglia cultures show that HIF also exerts antiviral and inflammation-restricting activity in human CNS cells. Collectively, the HIF transcription factor system senses virus-induced hypoxic stress to induce cell-intrinsic antiviral responses and limit inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Stephania japonica is an early-diverging eudicotyledon plant with high levels of cepharanthine, proven to be effective in curing coronavirus infections. Here, we report a high-quality S. japonica genome. The genome size is 688.52 Mb, and 97.37% sequences anchor to 11 chromosomes. The genome comprises 67.46% repetitive sequences and 21,036 genes. It is closely related to two Ranunculaceae species, which diverged from their common ancestor 55.90–71.02 million years ago (Mya) with a whole-genome duplication 85.59–96.75 Mya. We further reconstruct ancestral karyotype of Ranunculales. Several cepharanthine biosynthesis genes are identified and verified by western blot. Two genes (Sja03G0243 and Sja03G0241) exhibit catalytic activity as shown by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Then, cepharanthine biosynthesis genes, transcription factors, and CYP450 family genes are used to construct a comprehensive network. Finally, we construct an early-diverging eudicotyledonous genome resources (EEGR) database. As the first genome of the Menispermaceae family to be released, this study provides rich resources for genomic studies.

Abstract: Summary
The liver exhibits a remarkable capacity to regenerate following injury. Despite this unique attribute, toxic injury is a leading cause of liver failure. The temporal processes by which the liver senses injury and initiates regeneration remain unclear. Here, we developed a transgenic zebrafish model wherein hepatocyte-specific expression of uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT) enabled the implementation of SLAM-ITseq to investigate the nascent transcriptome during initiation of liver injury and regeneration. Using this approach, we identified a rapid metabolic transition from the fed to the fasted state that was followed by induction of the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) antioxidant program. We find that activation of Nrf2 in hepatocytes is required to induce the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and improve survival following liver injury. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that inhibition of the PPP disrupts nucleotide biosynthesis to prevent liver regeneration. Together, these studies provide fundamental insights into the mechanism by which early metabolic adaptation to injury facilitates tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
During transcription elongation, NusG aids RNA polymerase by inhibiting pausing, promoting anti-termination on rRNA operons, coupling transcription with translation on mRNA genes, and facilitating Rho-dependent termination. Despite extensive work, the in vivo functional allocation and spatial distribution of NusG remain unknown. Using single-molecule tracking and super-resolution imaging in live E. coli cells, we found NusG predominantly in a chromosome-associated population (binding to RNA polymerase in elongation complexes) and a slowly diffusing population complexed with the 30S ribosomal subunit; the latter provides a “30S-guided” path for NusG into transcription elongation. Only ∼10% of NusG is fast diffusing, with its mobility suggesting non-specific interactions with DNA for >50% of the time. Antibiotic treatments and deletion mutants revealed that chromosome-associated NusG participates mainly in rrn anti-termination within phase-separated transcriptional condensates and in transcription-translation coupling. This study illuminates the multiple roles of NusG and offers a guide on dissecting multi-functional machines via in vivo imaging.

Abstract: Summary
Initiation of timely and sufficient zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is crucial for the beginning of life, yet our knowledge of transcription factors (TFs) contributing to ZGA remains limited. Here, we screened the proteome of early mouse embryos after cycloheximide (CHX) treatment and identified maternally derived KLF17 as a potential TF for ZGA genes. Using a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model, we further investigated the role of maternal KLF17 and found that it promotes embryonic development and full fertility. Mechanistically, KLF17 preferentially binds to promoters and recruits RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) in early 2-cell embryos, facilitating the expression of major ZGA genes. Maternal Klf17 knockout resulted in a downregulation of 9% of ZGA genes and aberrant RNA Pol II pre-configuration, which could be partially rescued by introducing exogenous KLF17. Overall, our study provides a strategy for screening essential ZGA factors and identifies KLF17 as a crucial TF in this process.

Abstract: Summary
Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) ubiquitylate specific substrates selected from other cellular proteins. Substrate discrimination and ubiquitin transferase activity were thought to be strictly separated. Substrates are recognized by substrate receptors, such as Fbox or BCbox proteins. Meanwhile, CRLs employ assorted ubiquitin-carrying enzymes (UCEs, which are a collection of E2 and ARIH-family E3s) specialized for either initial substrate ubiquitylation (priming) or forging poly-ubiquitin chains. We discovered specific human CRL-UCE pairings governing substrate priming. The results reveal pairing of CUL2-based CRLs and UBE2R-family UCEs in cells, essential for efficient PROTAC-induced neo-substrate degradation. Despite UBE2R2’s intrinsic programming to catalyze poly-ubiquitylation, CUL2 employs this UCE for geometrically precise PROTAC-dependent ubiquitylation of a neo-substrate and for rapid priming of substrates recruited to diverse receptors. Cryo-EM structures illuminate how CUL2-based CRLs engage UBE2R2 to activate substrate ubiquitylation. Thus, pairing with a specific UCE overcomes E2 catalytic limitations to drive substrate ubiquitylation and targeted protein degradation.

Abstract: Summary
There is a broad diversity among Cas12a endonucleases that possess nucleic acid detection and gene-editing capabilities, but few are studied extensively. Here, we present an exhaustive investigation of 23 Cas12a orthologs, with a focus on their cis- and trans-cleavage activities in combination with noncanonical crRNAs. Through biochemical assays, we observe that some noncanonical crRNA:Cas12a effector complexes outperform their corresponding wild-type crRNA:Cas12a. Cas12a can recruit crRNA with modifications such as loop extensions and split scaffolds. Moreover, the tolerance of Cas12a to noncanonical crRNA is also observed in mammalian cells through the formation of indels. We apply the adaptability of Cas12a:crRNA complexes to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva samples, and tracheal aspirates. Our findings further expand the toolbox for next-generation CRISPR-based diagnostics and gene editing.

Abstract: Summary
T cell exhaustion impairs tumor immunity and contributes to resistance against immune checkpoint inhibitors. The nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A (NR4a) family of nuclear receptors plays a crucial role in driving T cell exhaustion. In this study, we observe that NR4a1 and NR4a2 deficiency in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) results in potent tumor eradication and exhibits not only reduced exhaustion characteristics but also an increase in the precursors/progenitors of exhausted T (Pre-Tex) cell fraction. Serial transfers of NR4a1−/−NR4a2−/−CD8+ TILs into tumor-bearing mice result in the expansion of TCF1+ (Tcf7+) stem-like Pre-Tex cells, whereas wild-type TILs are depleted upon secondary transfer. NR4a1/2-deficient CD8+ T cells express higher levels of stemness/memory-related genes and illustrate potent mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Collectively, these findings suggest that inhibiting NR4a in tumors represents a potent immuno-oncotherapy strategy by increasing stem-like Pre-Tex cells and reducing exhaustion of CD8+ T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to medulloblastoma (MB) formation and progression. We have identified an lncRNA, lnc-HLX-2-7, as a potential therapeutic target in group 3 (G3) MBs. lnc-HLX-2-7 RNA specifically accumulates in the promoter region of HLX, a sense-overlapping gene of lnc-HLX-2-7, which activates HLX expression by recruiting multiple factors, including enhancer elements. RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation reveal that HLX binds to and activates the promoters of several oncogenes, including TBX2, LIN9, HOXM1, and MYC. Intravenous treatment with cerium-oxide-nanoparticle-coated antisense oligonucleotides targeting lnc-HLX-2-7 (CNP-lnc-HLX-2-7) inhibits tumor growth by 40%–50% in an intracranial MB xenograft mouse model. Combining CNP-lnc-HLX-2-7 with standard-of-care cisplatin further inhibits tumor growth and significantly prolongs mouse survival compared with CNP-lnc-HLX-2-7 monotherapy. Thus, the lnc-HLX-2-7-HLX-MYC axis is important for regulating G3 MB progression, providing a strong rationale for using lnc-HLX-2-7 as a therapeutic target for G3 MBs.

Abstract: Summary
Motor neurons (MNs) constitute an ancient cell type targeted by multiple adult-onset diseases. It is therefore important to define the molecular makeup of adult MNs in animal models and extract organizing principles. Here, we generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of adult Caenorhabditis elegans MNs and a searchable database. Single-cell RNA sequencing of 13,200 cells reveals that ventral nerve cord MNs cluster into 29 molecularly distinct subclasses. Extending C. elegans Neuronal Gene Expression Map and Network (CeNGEN) findings, all MN subclasses are delineated by distinct expression codes of either neuropeptide or transcription factor gene families. Strikingly, combinatorial codes of homeodomain transcription factor genes succinctly delineate adult MN diversity in both C. elegans and mice. Further, molecularly defined MN subclasses in C. elegans display distinct patterns of connectivity. Hence, our study couples the connectivity map of the C. elegans motor circuit with a molecular atlas of its constituent MNs and uncovers organizing principles and conserved molecular codes of adult MN diversity.

Abstract: Summary
During asymmetric division of Drosophila larval neuroblasts, the fate determinant Prospero (Pros) and its adaptor Miranda (Mira) are segregated to the basal cortex through atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) phosphorylation of Mira and displacement from the apical cortex, but Mira localization after aPKC phosphorylation is not well understood. We identify Kin17, a DNA replication and repair protein, as a regulator of Mira localization during asymmetric cell division. Loss of Kin17 leads to aberrant localization of Mira and Pros to the centrosome, cytoplasm, and nucleus. We provide evidence to show that the mislocalization of Mira and Pros is likely due to reduced expression of Falafel (Flfl), a component of protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), and defects in dephosphorylation of serine-96 of Mira. Our work reveals that Mira is likely dephosphorylated by PP4 at the centrosome to ensure proper basal localization of Mira after aPKC phosphorylation and that Kin17 regulates PP4 activity by regulating Flfl expression.

Abstract: Summary
Population genetics continues to identify genetic variants associated with diseases of the immune system and offers a unique opportunity to discover mechanisms of immune regulation. Multiple genetic variants linked to severe fungal infections and autoimmunity are associated with caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9). We leverage the CARD9 R101C missense variant to uncover a biochemical mechanism of CARD9 activation essential for antifungal responses. We demonstrate that R101C disrupts a critical signaling switch whereby phosphorylation of S104 releases CARD9 from an autoinhibited state to promote inflammatory responses in myeloid cells. Furthermore, we show that CARD9 R101C exerts dynamic effects on the skin cellular contexture during fungal infection, corrupting inflammatory signaling and cell-cell communication circuits. Card9 R101C mice fail to control dermatophyte infection in the skin, resulting in high fungal burden, yet show minimal signs of inflammation. Together, we demonstrate how translational genetics reveals molecular and cellular mechanisms of innate immune regulation.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative conditions. Alpha-synuclein deposition, Lewy bodies (LBs) formation, disruption of the autophagic machinery, apoptosis of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation are all pathologic hallmarks of PD. The leaves of the stinging Nettle (Urtica dioica L.) have a long history as an herbal cure with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties. The current study aims for the first time to investigate the role of Nettle supplementation on Rotenone-induced PD. Rats were divided into five groups; a Saline control, Nettle control (100 mg/kg/day), Rotenone control (2 mg/kg/day), Rotenone + Nettle (50 mg /kg/day), and Rotenone + Nettle (100 mg/kg). After four weeks, the rats were examined for behavioral tests. The midbrains were investigated for histopathological alteration and immunohistochemical reaction for Tyrosine hydroxylase in the dopaminergic neurons, α-synuclein for Lewy bodies, caspase 3 for apoptotic neurons, LC3 and P62 for autophagic activity. Midbrain homogenates were examined for oxidative stress markers. mRNA expression of TNFα and Il6; inflammatory markers, Bcl-2, BAX and Caspase 3; apoptosis markers, were detected in midbrains. The results showed that Nettle caused recovery of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, by inhibiting apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress and by restoring the autophagic machinery with clearance of α-synuclein deposits. We can conclude that Nettle is a potentially effective adjuvant in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Protection from liver damage and the repercussion of that harm is thought to be crucial for reducing the number of deaths each year. This work was developed to evaluate the possible role of silver nanocomposite prepared using Nigella sativa (N. sativa) aqueous extract against the hepatic damage brought on by thioacetamide (TAA), with particular attention to how they affect the NF-κβ, TNF-α, IL-1β, and COX-2 signaling pathways. There were seven groups of male Wistar rats used as follows: control, saline, N. sativa aqueous extract (NSAE; 200 mg/kg/d), N. sativa silver nanocomposite (NS-AgNC; 0.25 mg/kg/d), TAA (100 mg/kg; thrice weekly), NSAE + TTA, and NS-AgNC + TAA, respectively. The experiment continued for six weeks. The results showed that NS-AgNPs significantly enhanced liver functions (p<0.05) (albumin, ALP, LDH, AST, total protein, ALT, and globulin) and oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers (p<0.05) (H2O2, MDA, PCC, NO, SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, GST and, GSH), contrasted with TAA group. Moreover, a significant (p<0.05) downregulation of the gene expressions (COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and NF-κβ) was also achieved by using silver nanocomposite therapy. These findings have been supported by histological analysis. Collectively, NS-AgNC exhibits more prominent and well-recognized protective impacts than NSAE in modulating the anti-inflammatory, genotoxicity and oxidative stress effects against TAA-induced liver injuries.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a conserved cellular process, and its dysfunction is implicated in cancer and other diseases. Here, we employ an in vivo CRISPR screen targeting genes implicated in the regulation of autophagy to identify the Nsfl1c gene encoding p47 as a suppressor of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ breast cancer metastasis. p47 ablation specifically increases metastasis without promoting primary mammary tumor growth. Analysis of human breast cancer patient databases and tissue samples indicates a correlation of lower p47 expression levels with metastasis and decreased survival. Mechanistic studies show that p47 functions in the repair of lysosomal damage for autophagy flux and in the endosomal trafficking of nuclear factor κB essential modulator for lysosomal degradation to promote metastasis. Our results demonstrate a role and mechanisms of p47 in the regulation of breast cancer metastasis. They highlight the potential to exploit p47 as a suppressor of metastasis through multiple pathways in HER2+ breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Combination therapy (lenvatinib/programmed death-1 inhibitor) is effective for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). We reveal that responders have better overall and progression-free survival, as well as high tumor mutation burden and special somatic variants. We analyze the proteome and metabolome of 82 plasma samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; n = 51) and normal controls (n = 15), revealing that individual differences outweigh treatment differences. Responders exhibit enhanced activity in the alternative/lectin complement pathway and higher levels of lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPCs), predicting a favorable prognosis. Non-responders are enriched for immunoglobulins, predicting worse outcomes. Compared to normal controls, HCC plasma proteins show acute inflammatory response and platelet activation, while LysoPCs decrease. Combination therapy increases LysoPCs/phosphocholines in responders. Logistic regression/random forest models using metabolomic features achieve good performance in the prediction of responders. Proteomic analysis of cancer tissues unveils molecular features that are associated with side effects in responders receiving combination therapy. In conclusion, our analysis identifies plasma features associated with uHCC responders to combination therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The high incidence of whole-arm chromosome aneuploidy and translocations in tumors suggests instability of centromeres, unique loci built on repetitive sequences and essential for chromosome separation. The causes behind this fragility and the mechanisms preserving centromere integrity remain elusive. We show that replication stress, hallmark of pre-cancerous lesions, promotes centromeric breakage in mitosis, due to spindle forces and endonuclease activities. Mechanistically, we unveil unique dynamics of the centromeric replisome distinct from the rest of the genome. Locus-specific proteomics identifies specialized DNA replication and repair proteins at centromeres, highlighting them as difficult-to-replicate regions. The translesion synthesis pathway, along with other factors, acts to sustain centromere replication and integrity. Prolonged stress causes centromeric alterations like ruptures and translocations, as observed in ovarian cancer models experiencing replication stress. This study provides unprecedented insights into centromere replication and integrity, proposing mechanistic insights into the origins of centromere alterations leading to abnormal cancerous karyotypes.

Abstract: Summary
The increasing emergence of Cas9 variants has attracted broad interest, as these variants were designed to expand CRISPR applications. New Cas9 variants typically feature higher editing efficiency, improved editing specificity, or alternative PAM sequences. To select Cas9 variants and gRNAs for high-fidelity and efficient genome editing, it is crucial to systematically quantify the editing performances of gRNAs and develop prediction models based on high-quality datasets. Using synthetic gRNA-target paired libraries and next-generation sequencing, we compared the activity and specificity of gRNAs of four SpCas9 variants. The nucleotide composition in the PAM-distal region had more influence on the editing efficiency of HiFi Cas9 and LZ3 Cas9. We further developed machine learning models to predict the gRNA efficiency and specificity for the four Cas9 variants. To aid users from broad research areas, the machine learning models for the predictions of gRNA editing efficiency within human genome sites are available on our website.

Abstract: Summary
Higher-order genome structure influences the transcriptional regulation of cellular genes through the juxtaposition of regulatory elements, such as enhancers, close to promoters of target genes. While enhancer activation has emerged as an important facet of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) biology, the mechanisms controlling enhancer-target gene expression remain obscure. Here, we discover that the KSHV genome tethering protein latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) potentiates enhancer-target gene expression in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), a highly aggressive B cell lymphoma causally associated with KSHV. Genome-wide analyses demonstrate increased levels of enhancer RNA transcription as well as activating chromatin marks at LANA-bound enhancers. 3D genome conformation analyses identified genes critical for latency and tumorigenesis as targets of LANA-occupied enhancers, and LANA depletion results in their downregulation. These findings reveal a mechanism in enhancer-gene coordination and describe a role through which the main KSHV tethering protein regulates essential gene expression in PEL.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant long interspersed element 1 (LINE-1 or L1) activity can cause insertional mutagenesis and chromosomal rearrangements and has been detected in several types of cancers. Here, we show that neddylation, a post-translational modification process, is essential for L1 transposition. The antineoplastic drug MLN4924 is an L1 inhibitor that suppresses NEDD8-activating enzyme activity. Neddylation inhibition by MLN4924 selectively impairs ORF2p-mediated L1 reverse transcription and blocks the generation of L1 cDNA. Consistent with these results, MLN4924 treatment suppresses the retrotransposition activity of the non-autonomous retrotransposons short interspersed nuclear element R/variable number of tandem repeat/Alu and Alu, which rely on the reverse transcription activity of L1 ORF2p. The E2 enzyme UBE2M in the neddylation pathway, rather than UBE2F, is required for L1 ORF2p and retrotransposition. Interference with the functions of certain neddylation-dependent Cullin-really interesting new gene E3 ligases disrupts L1 reverse transcription and transposition activity. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of L1 retrotransposition and the identification of therapeutic targets for L1 dysfunctions.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of the mammalian brain to maintain spatial representations of external or internal information for short periods of time has been associated with sustained neuronal spiking and reverberatory neural network activity in the medial entorhinal cortex. Here, we show that conditional genetic deletion of netrin-1 or the netrin receptor deleted-in-colorectal cancer (DCC) from forebrain excitatory neurons leads to deficits in short-term spatial memory. We then demonstrate that conditional deletion of either netrin-1 or DCC inhibits cholinergic persistent firing and show that cholinergic activation of muscarinic receptors expressed by entorhinal cortical neurons promotes persistent firing by recruiting DCC to the plasma membrane. Together, these findings indicate that normal short-term spatial memory function requires the synergistic actions of acetylcholine and netrin-1.

Abstract: Summary
The brain is spatially organized and contains unique cell types, each performing diverse functions and exhibiting differential susceptibility to neurodegeneration. This is exemplified in Parkinson’s disease with the preferential loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Using a Parkinson’s transgenic model, we conducted a single-cell spatial transcriptomic and dopaminergic neuron translatomic analysis of young and old mouse brains. Through the high resolving capacity of single-cell spatial transcriptomics, we provide a deep characterization of the expression features of dopaminergic neurons and 27 other cell types within their spatial context, identifying markers of healthy and aging cells, spanning Parkinson’s relevant pathways. We integrate gene enrichment and genome-wide association study data to prioritize putative causative genes for disease investigation, identifying CASR as a regulator of dopaminergic calcium handling. These datasets represent the largest public resource for the investigation of spatial gene expression in brain cells in health, aging, and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. While MYCN and mutant anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALKF1174L) cooperate in tumorigenesis, how ALK contributes to tumor formation remains unclear. Here, we used a human stem cell-based model of neuroblastoma. Mis-expression of ALKF1174L and MYCN resulted in shorter latency compared to MYCN alone. MYCN tumors resembled adrenergic, while ALK/MYCN tumors resembled mesenchymal, neuroblastoma. Transcriptomic analysis revealed enrichment in focal adhesion signaling, particularly the extracellular matrix genes POSTN and FN1 in ALK/MYCN tumors. Patients with ALK-mutant tumors similarly demonstrated elevated levels of POSTN and FN1. Knockdown of POSTN, but not FN1, delayed adhesion and suppressed proliferation of ALK/MYCN tumors. Furthermore, loss of POSTN reduced ALK-dependent activation of WNT signaling. Reciprocally, inhibition of the WNT pathway reduced expression of POSTN and growth of ALK/MYCN tumor cells. Thus, ALK drives neuroblastoma in part through a feedforward loop between POSTN and WNT signaling.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD4+ CTLs) are suggested to play a crucial role in inflammatory diseases, including cancer, but their characteristics in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unknown. Here, using the cell surface marker CD11b, we identify CD11b+CD4+ CTLs as a cytotoxic subset of CD4+ T cells in multiple tissues of NSCLC patients. In addition, tumor-infiltrating CD11b+CD4+ CTLs show a dysfunctional phenotype with elevated expression of CD200 receptor (CD200R), a negatively immunomodulatory receptor. CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells restrain the anti-tumor role of CD11b+CD4+ CTLs via CD200. Mechanistically, inflammatory dendritic cells promote the CD200R expression of CD11b+CD4+ CTLs by secreting interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Finally, we demonstrate that CD200 blockade can revive the tumor-killing role of CD11b+CD4+ CTLs and prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Taken together, our study identifies CD11b+CD4+ CTLs in NSCLC with decreased cytotoxicity that can be reinvigorated by CD200 blockade, suggesting that targeting CD200 is a promising immunotherapy strategy in NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Hearing starts, at the cellular level, with mechanoelectrical transduction by sensory hair cells. Sound information is then transmitted via afferent synaptic connections with auditory neurons. Frequency information is encoded by the location of hair cells along the cochlear duct. Loss of hair cells, synapses, or auditory neurons leads to permanent hearing loss in mammals. Birds, in contrast, regenerate auditory hair cells and functionally recover from hearing loss. Here, we characterized regeneration and reinnervation in sisomicin-deafened chickens and found that afferent neurons contact regenerated hair cells at the tips of basal projections. In contrast to development, synaptic specializations are established at these locations distant from the hair cells’ bodies. The protrusions then contracted as regenerated hair cells matured and became functional 2 weeks post-deafening. We found that auditory thresholds recovered after 4–5 weeks. We interpret the regeneration-specific synaptic reestablishment as a location-preserving process that might be needed to maintain tonotopic fidelity.

Abstract: Summary
The radioresistant signature of colorectal cancer (CRC) hampers the clinical utility of radiotherapy. Here, we find that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) potentiates the tumoricidal effects of radiation and degrades the intertwined adverse events in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced CRC mice. FMT cumulates Roseburia intestinalis (R. intestinalis) in the gastrointestinal tract. Oral gavage of R. intestinalis assembles at the CRC site and synthetizes butyrate, sensitizing CRC to radiation and alleviating intestinal toxicity in primary and CRC hepatic metastasis mouse models. R. intestinalis-derived butyrate activates OR51E1, a G-protein-coupled receptor overexpressing in patients with rectal cancer, facilitating radiogenic autophagy in CRC cells. OR51E1 shows a positive correlation with RALB in clinical rectal cancer tissues and CRC mouse model. Blockage of OR51E1/RALB signaling restrains butyrate-elicited autophagy in irradiated CRC cells. Our findings highlight that the gut commensal bacteria R. intestinalis motivates radiation-induced autophagy to accelerate CRC cell death through the butyrate/OR51E1/RALB axis and provide a promising radiosensitizer for CRC in a pre-clinical setting.

Abstract: Summary
The agricultural green revolution spectacularly enhanced crop yield through modification of gibberellin (GA) signaling. However, in cotton, the GA signaling cascades remain elusive, limiting our potential to cultivate new cotton varieties and improve yield and quality. Here, we identified that GA prominently stimulated fiber elongation through the degradation of DELLA protein GhSLR1, thereby disabling GhSLR1’s physical interaction with two transcription factors, GhZFP8 and GhBLH1. Subsequently, the resultant free GhBLH1 binds to GhKCS12 promoter and activates its expression to enhance VLCFAs biosynthesis. With a similar mechanism, the free GhZFP8 binds to GhSDCP1 promoter and activates its expression. As a result, GhSDCP1 upregulates the expression of GhPIF3 gene associated with plant cell elongation. Ultimately, the two parallel signaling cascades synergistically promote cotton fiber elongation. Our findings outline the mechanistic framework that translates the GA signal into fiber cell elongation, thereby offering a roadmap to improve cotton fiber quality and yield.

Abstract: Summary
The premetastatic niche (PMN) contributes to lung-specific metastatic tropism in osteosarcoma. However, the crosstalk between primary tumor cells and lung stromal cells is not clearly defined. Here, we dissect the composition of immune cells in the lung PMN and identify granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (gMDSC) infiltration as positively associated with immunosuppressive PMN formation and tumor cell colonization. Osteosarcoma-cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) activate lung interstitial macrophages to initiate the influx of gMDSCs via secretion of the chemokine CXCL2. Proteomic profiling of EVs reveals that EV-packaged S100A11 stimulates the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway in macrophages by interacting with USP9X. High level of S100A11 expression or circulating gMDSCs correlates with the presentation of lung metastasis and poor prognosis in osteosarcoma patients. In summary, we identify a key role of tumor-derived EVs in lung PMN formation, providing potential strategies for monitoring or preventing lung metastasis in osteosarcoma.

Abstract: Summary
Brain functionality relies on finely tuned regulation of gene expression by networks of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as the one composed by the circular RNA ciRS-7 (also known as CDR1as), the microRNA miR-7, and the long ncRNA Cyrano. We describe ischemia-induced alterations in the ncRNA network both in vitro and in vivo and in transgenic mice lacking ciRS-7 or miR-7. Our data show that cortical neurons downregulate ciRS-7 and Cyrano and upregulate miR-7 expression during ischemia. Mice lacking ciRS-7 exhibit reduced lesion size and motor impairment, while the absence of miR-7 alone results in increased ischemia-induced neuronal death. Moreover, miR-7 levels in pyramidal excitatory neurons regulate neurite morphology and glutamatergic signaling, suggesting a potential molecular link to the in vivo phenotype. Our data reveal the role of ciRS-7 and miR-7 in modulating ischemic stroke outcome, shedding light on the pathophysiological function of intracellular ncRNA networks in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Deaminases have important uses in modification detection and genome editing. However, the range of applications is limited by the small number of characterized enzymes. To expand the toolkit of deaminases, we developed an in vitro approach that bypasses a major hurdle with their toxicity in cells. We assayed 175 putative cytosine deaminases on a variety of substrates and found a broad range of activity on double- and single-stranded DNA in various sequence contexts, including CpG-specific deaminases and enzymes without sequence preference. We also characterized enzyme selectivity across six DNA modifications and reported enzymes that do not deaminate modified cytosines. The detailed analysis of diverse deaminases opens new avenues for biotechnological and medical applications. As a demonstration, we developed SEM-seq, a non-destructive single-enzyme methylation sequencing method using a modification-sensitive double-stranded DNA deaminase. The streamlined protocol enables accurate, base-resolution methylome mapping of scarce biological material, including cell-free DNA and 10 pg input DNA.

Abstract: The hyperpermeability of intestinal epithelium is a key contributor to the occurrence and development of systemic inflammation. Although D-beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) exhibits various protective effects, whether it affects the permeability of intestinal epithelium in systemic inflammation has not been clarified. In this study, we investigated the effects of BHB on the intestinal epithelial permeability, the epithelial marker E-cadherin and the tight junction protein Claudin-1 in colon in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation mouse model. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS was used to induce systemic inflammation and BHB was given by oral administration. The permeability of intestinal epithelium, the morphological changes of colonic epithelium, the distribution and generation of colon E-cadherin, and the Claudin-1 generation and its epithelial distribution in colon were detected. The results confirmed the intestinal epithelial hyperpermeability and inflammatory changes in colonic epithelium, with disturbed E-cadherin distribution in LPS-treated mice. Besides, colon Claudin-1 generation was decreased and its epithelial distribution in colon was weakened in LPS-treated mice. However, BHB treatments alleviated the LPS-induced hyperpermeability of intestinal epithelium, attenuated the colonic epithelial morphological changes and promoted orderly distribution of E-cadherin in colon. Furthermore, BHB up-regulated colon Claudin-1 generation and promoted its colonic epithelial distribution and content in LPS-treated mice. In conclusion, BHB may alleviate the hyperpermeability of intestinal epithelium via up-regulation of Claudin-1 in colon in LPS-treated mice.

Abstract: The ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells, with both high quantities and quality, is considered a paramount issue in cell and gene therapy for hematological diseases. Complex interactions between the bone marrow microenvironment and hematopoietic stem cells reveal the importance of using 2D and 3D coculture as a physiological system simulator in the proliferation, differentiation, and homeostasis of HSCs. Herein, the capacity of mesenchymal stem cells derived from different sources to support the expansion and maintenance of HSPC was compared with each other. We evaluated the fold increase of HSPC, CD34 marker expression, cytokine secretion profile of different MSCs, and the frequency of hematopoietic colony-forming unit parameters. Our results show that there was no significant difference between adipose tissue-MSC, Wharton jelly-MSC, and Endometrial-MSCs in HSPC expansion (fold increase: 34.74±4.38 in Wj-MSC, 32.22±5.07 in AD-MSC, 25.9±1.27 in En-MSCs); However, there were significantly more than the expansion media alone (4.4±0.69). The results obtained from the cytokine secretion analysis also confirm these results. Also, there were significant differences in the clonogenicity of Wj-MSC, En-MSCs, and expansion media (CFU-GEMM: 7±1.73, 2.3±1.15, and 2.3±1.52), which indicated that Wj-MSC could significantly maintain the primitive state. As a result, using Wj-mesenchymal stem cells on a 3D coculture system effectively increases the HSPC expansion and maintains the colonization potential of hematopoietic stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
R-loops are three-stranded structures that can pose threats to genome stability. RNase H1 precisely recognizes R-loops to drive their resolution within the genome, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we report that ARID1A recognizes R-loops with high affinity in an ATM-dependent manner. ARID1A recruits METTL3 and METTL14 to the R-loop, leading to the m6A methylation of R-loop RNA. This m6A modification facilitates the recruitment of RNase H1 to the R-loop, driving its resolution and promoting DNA end resection at DSBs, thereby ensuring genome stability. Depletion of ARID1A, METTL3, or METTL14 leads to R-loop accumulation and reduced cell survival upon exposure to cytotoxic agents. Therefore, ARID1A, METTL3, and METTL14 function in a coordinated, temporal order at DSB sites to recruit RNase H1 and to ensure efficient R-loop resolution. Given the association of high ARID1A levels with resistance to genotoxic therapies in patients, these findings open avenues for exploring potential therapeutic strategies for cancers with ARID1A abnormalities.

Abstract: Summary
Alphaviruses are mosquito-transmitted pathogens that induce high levels of viremia, which facilitates dissemination and vector transmission. One prevailing paradigm is that, after skin inoculation, alphavirus-infected resident dendritic cells migrate to the draining lymph node (DLN), facilitating further rounds of infection and dissemination. Here, we assess the contribution of infiltrating myeloid cells to alphavirus spread. We observe two phases of virus transport to the DLN, one that occurs starting at 1 h post infection and precedes viral replication, and a second that requires replication in the skin, enabling transit to the bloodstream. Depletion of Ly6C+ monocytes reduces local chikungunya (CHIKV) or Ross River virus (RRV) infection in the skin, diminishes the second phase of virus transport to the DLN, and delays spread to distal sites. Our data suggest that infiltrating monocytes facilitate alphavirus infection at the initial infection site, which promotes more rapid spread into circulation.

Abstract: Summary
Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Due to the lack of trunk neuromuscular organoids (NMOs) from ALS patients’ induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), an organoid system was missing to model the trunk spinal neuromuscular neurodegeneration. With the C9orf72 ALS patient-derived iPSCs and isogenic controls, we used an NMO system containing trunk spinal cord neural and peripheral muscular tissues to show that the ALS NMOs could model peripheral defects in ALS, including contraction weakness, neural denervation, and loss of Schwann cells. The neurons and astrocytes in ALS NMOs manifested the RNA foci and dipeptide repeat proteins. Acute treatment with the unfolded protein response inhibitor GSK2606414 increased the glutamatergic muscular contraction 2-fold and reduced the dipeptide repeat protein aggregation and autophagy. This study provides an organoid system for spinal neuromuscular pathologies in ALS and its application for drug testing.

Abstract: Summary
Cell types can be classified according to shared patterns of transcription. Non-genetic variability among individual cells of the same type has been ascribed to stochastic transcriptional bursting and transient cell states. Using high-coverage single-cell RNA profiling, we asked whether long-term, heritable differences in gene expression can impart diversity within cells of the same type. Studying clonal human lymphocytes and mouse brain cells, we uncovered a vast diversity of heritable gene expression patterns among different clones of cells of the same type in vivo. We combined chromatin accessibility and RNA profiling on different lymphocyte clones to reveal thousands of regulatory regions exhibiting interclonal variation, which could be directly linked to interclonal variation in gene expression. Our findings identify a source of cellular diversity, which may have important implications for how cellular populations are shaped by selective processes in development, aging, and disease. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Parallel visual pathways from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1) via the lateral geniculate nucleus are common to many mammalian species, including mice, carnivores, and primates. However, it remains unclear which visual features present in both retina and V1 may be inherited from parallel pathways versus extracted by V1 circuits in the mouse. Here, using calcium imaging and rabies circuit tracing, we explore the relationships between tuning of layer 4 (L4) V1 neurons and their retinal ganglion cell (RGC) inputs. We find that subpopulations of L4 V1 neurons differ in their tuning for direction, orientation, spatial frequency, temporal frequency, and speed. Furthermore, we find that direction-tuned L4 V1 neurons receive input from direction-selective RGCs, whereas orientation-tuned L4 V1 neurons receive input from orientation-selective RGCs. These results suggest that direction and orientation tuning of V1 neurons may be partly inherited from parallel pathways originating in the retina.

Abstract: Summary
Hippocampal principal neurons display both spatial tuning properties and memory features. Whether this distinction corresponds to separate neuron types or a context-dependent continuum has been debated. We report here that the task-context (“splitter”) feature is highly variable along both trial and spatial position axes. Neurons acquire or lose splitter features across trials even when place field features remain unaltered. Multiple place fields of the same neuron can individually encode both past or future run trajectories, implying that splitter fields are under the control of assembly activity. Place fields can be differentiated into subfields by the behavioral choice of the animal, and splitting within subfields evolves across trials. Interneurons also differentiate choices by integrating inputs from pyramidal cells. Finally, bilateral optogenetic inactivation of the medial entorhinal cortex reversibly decreases the fraction of splitter fields. Our findings suggest that place or splitter features are different manifestations of the same hippocampal computation.

Abstract: Summary
Communication between adjacent endothelial cells is important for the homeostasis of blood vessels. We show that quiescent endothelial cells use Jagged1 to instruct neighboring endothelial cells to assume a quiescent phenotype and secure the endothelial barrier. This phenotype enforcement by neighboring cells is operated by R-Ras through activation of Akt3, which results in upregulation of a Notch ligand Jagged1 and consequential upregulation of Notch target genes, such as UNC5B, and VE-cadherin accumulation in the neighboring cells. These signaling events lead to the stable interaction between neighboring endothelial cells to continue to fortify juxtacrine signaling via Jagged1-Notch. This mode of intercellular signaling provides a positive feedback regulation of endothelial cell-cell interactions and cellular quiescence required for the stabilization of the endothelium.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous viruses alter host microtubule (MT) networks during infection, but how and why they induce these changes is unclear in many cases. We show that the vaccinia virus (VV)-encoded A51R protein is a MT-associated protein (MAP) that directly binds MTs and stabilizes them by both promoting their growth and preventing their depolymerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that A51R-MT interactions are conserved across A51R proteins from multiple poxvirus genera, and highly conserved, positively charged residues in A51R proteins mediate these interactions. Strikingly, we find that viruses encoding MT interaction-deficient A51R proteins fail to suppress a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent antiviral response in macrophages that leads to a block in virion morphogenesis. Moreover, A51R-MT interactions are required for VV virulence in mice. Collectively, our data show that poxviral MAP-MT interactions overcome a cell-intrinsic antiviral ROS response in macrophages that would otherwise block virus morphogenesis and replication in animals.

Abstract: Summary
The ribosome-tethered N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA) acetylates 52% of soluble proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. This co-translational modification of the N terminus stabilizes diverse cytosolic plant proteins. The evolutionary conserved Huntingtin yeast partner K (HYPK) facilitates NatA activity in planta, but in vitro, its N-terminal helix α1 inhibits human NatA activity. To dissect the regulatory function of HYPK protein domains in vivo, we genetically engineer CRISPR-Cas9 mutants expressing a HYPK fragment lacking all functional domains (hypk-cr1) or an internally deleted HYPK variant truncating helix α1 but retaining the C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (hypk-cr2). We find that the UBA domain of HYPK is vital for stabilizing the NatA complex in an organ-specific manner. The N terminus of HYPK, including helix α1, is critical for promoting NatA activity on substrates starting with various amino acids. Consequently, deleting only 42 amino acids inside the HYPK N terminus causes substantial destabilization of the plant proteome and higher tolerance toward drought stress.

Abstract: Summary
In multicellular organisms, cell types must be produced and maintained in appropriate proportions. One way this is achieved is through committed progenitor cells or extrinsic interactions that produce specific patterns of descendant cell types on lineage trees. However, cell fate commitment is probabilistic in most contexts, making it difficult to infer these dynamics and understand how they establish overall cell type proportions. Here, we introduce Lineage Motif Analysis (LMA), a method that recursively identifies statistically overrepresented patterns of cell fates on lineage trees as potential signatures of committed progenitor states or extrinsic interactions. Applying LMA to published datasets reveals spatial and temporal organization of cell fate commitment in zebrafish and rat retina and early mouse embryonic development. Comparative analysis of vertebrate species suggests that lineage motifs facilitate adaptive evolutionary variation of retinal cell type proportions. LMA thus provides insight into complex developmental processes by decomposing them into simpler underlying modules.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial outer membrane ⍺-helical proteins play critical roles in mitochondrial-cytoplasmic communication, but the rules governing the targeting and insertion of these biophysically diverse proteins remain unknown. Here, we first defined the complement of required mammalian biogenesis machinery through genome-wide CRISPRi screens using topologically distinct membrane proteins. Systematic analysis of nine identified factors across 21 diverse ⍺-helical substrates reveals that these components are organized into distinct targeting pathways that act on substrates based on their topology. NAC is required for the efficient targeting of polytopic proteins, whereas signal-anchored proteins require TTC1, a cytosolic chaperone that physically engages substrates. Biochemical and mutational studies reveal that TTC1 employs a conserved TPR domain and a hydrophobic groove in its C-terminal domain to support substrate solubilization and insertion into mitochondria. Thus, the targeting of diverse mitochondrial membrane proteins is achieved through topological triaging in the cytosol using principles with similarities to ER membrane protein biogenesis systems.

Abstract: Echinococcus granulosus is a zoonotic parasite infects many livestock species, especially cattle, sheep, goat and buffalo, causing cystic echinococcosis. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the presence of the parasite and parasitic tissue damage histopathologically and to determine the role of oxidative stress in the tissue damage through the immunohistochemical detection of the oxidative damage-marker malondialdehyde (MDA) and the antioxidant response-marker superoxide dismutase (SOD). The material of the study consisted of 20 liver samples with Echinococcus cysts and 10 E.granulosus- negative healthy liver samples obtained from different cattle at various times from slaughterhouses in Kırıkkale province, Turkey. Histopathologically, Echinococcus cysts of various sizes were observed along with the surrounding fibrous connective tissue. Giant cells, mononuclear cells, and eosinophilic leukocytes were found between the fibrous connective tissue and the cyst. In the parenchymal tissue distant from the cyst, inflammatory changes were observed, including vacuolation and necrosis in hepatocytes, congestion and dilation sinusoidal capillaries. Immunohistochemically, MDA immunopositivity was observed in both hepatocytes surrounding the cyst and areas distant from the cyst, while SOD immunopositivity was mainly detected in fibrous connective tissue and hepatocytes surrounding the Echinococcus cysts. A significant increase in MDA immunoreactivity was observed in E.granulosus s.l.-infected livers. Although no statistically significant change was observed in SOD immunopositivity in the liver tissues with cystic echinococcosis, regional variations were noted. Germinal layer (GL) of Echinococcus cyst showed immunopositive staining for MDA, while laminated layer (LL) exhibited immunonegative staining. To the authors' best understanding, this study represents a pioneering effort in showcasing and evaluating the immunoreactivities of MDA and SOD within the liver tissue afflicted with Echinococcus cysts. Simultaneously, the examination extends to encompass tissue damage and the infiltration of inflammatory cells. This study highlights the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) and the need for further investigation of antioxidant defense mechanisms and their regional variations.

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s) possess adaptive immune features, which confer antigen-specific memory responses against haptens and viruses. However, the transcriptional regulation of memory ILC1 responses is currently not known. We show that retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα) has high expression in memory ILC1s in murine contact hypersensitivity (CHS) models. RORα deficiency diminishes ILC1-mediated CHS responses significantly but has no effect on memory T cell-mediated CHS responses. During sensitization, RORα promotes sensitized-ILC1 expansion by suppressing expression of cell-cycle repressors in draining lymph nodes. RORα programs gene-expression patterns related to cell survival and is required for the long-term maintenance of memory ILC1s in the liver. Our findings reveal RORα to be a key transcriptional factor for sensitized-ILC1 expansion and long-term maintenance of memory ILC1s.

Abstract: Summary
The extrinsic diet and the intrinsic developmental programs are intertwined. Although extensive research has been conducted on how nutrition regulates development, whether and how developmental programs control the timing of nutritional responses remain barely known. Here, we report that a developmental timing regulator, BLMP-1/BLIMP1, governs the temporal response to dietary restriction (DR). At the end of larval development, BLMP-1 is induced and interacts with DR-activated PHA-4/FOXA, a key transcription factor responding to the reduced nutrition. By integrating temporal and nutritional signaling, the DR response regulates many development-related genes, including gska-3/GSK3β, through BLMP-1-PHA-4 at the onset of adulthood. Upon DR, a precocious activation of BLMP-1 in early larval stages impairs neuronal development through gska-3, whereas the increase of gska-3 by BLMP-1-PHA-4 at the last larval stage suppresses WNT signaling in adulthood for DR-induced longevity. Our findings reveal a temporal checkpoint of the DR response that protects larval development and promotes adult health.

Abstract: Summary
Cells attach to the world through either cell-extracellular matrix adhesion or cell-cell adhesion, and traditional biomaterials imitate the matrix for integrin-based adhesion. However, materials incorporating cadherin proteins that mimic cell-cell adhesion offer an alternative to program cell behavior and integrate into living tissues. We investigated how cadherin substrates affect collective cell migration and cell cycling in epithelia. Our approach involved biomaterials with matrix proteins on one-half and E-cadherin proteins on the other, forming a “Janus” interface across which we grew a single sheet of cells. Tissue regions over the matrix side exhibited normal collective dynamics, but an abrupt behavior shift occurred across the Janus boundary onto the E-cadherin side, where cells attached to the substrate via E-cadherin adhesions, resulting in stalled migration and slowing of the cell cycle. E-cadherin surfaces disrupted long-range mechanical coordination and nearly doubled the length of the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, linked to the lack of integrin focal adhesions on the E-cadherin surface.

Abstract: Summary
Many bacteria use operons to coregulate genes, but it remains unclear how operons benefit bacteria. We integrated E. coli’s 788 polycistronic operons and 1,231 transcription units into an existing whole-cell model and found inconsistencies between the proposed operon structures and the RNA-seq read counts that the model was parameterized from. We resolved these inconsistencies through iterative, model-guided corrections to both datasets, including the correction of RNA-seq counts of short genes that were misreported as zero by existing alignment algorithms. The resulting model suggested two main modes by which operons benefit bacteria. For 86% of low-expression operons, adding operons increased the co-expression probabilities of their constituent proteins, whereas for 92% of high-expression operons, adding operons resulted in more stable expression ratios between the proteins. These simulations underscored the need for further experimental work on how operons reduce noise and synchronize both the expression timing and the quantity of constituent genes.

Abstract: Summary
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is arguably the most lethal human malignancy. It often co-occurs with differentiated thyroid cancers, yet the molecular origins of its aggressivity are unknown. We sequenced tumor DNA from 329 regions of thyroid cancer, including 213 from patients with primary anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. We also whole genome sequenced 9 patients using multi-region sequencing of both differentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancer components. Using these data, we demonstrate thatanaplastic thyroid carcinomas have a higher burden of mutations than other thyroid cancers, with distinct mutational signatures and molecular subtypes. Further, different cancer driver genes are mutated in anaplastic and differentiated thyroid carcinomas, even those arising in a single patient. Finally, we unambiguously demonstrate that anaplastic thyroid carcinomas share a genomic origin with co-occurring differentiated carcinomas and emerge from a common malignant field through acquisition of characteristic clonal driver mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Statins are currently the most common cholesterol-lowering drug, but the underlying mechanism of statin-induced hyperglycemia is unclear. To investigate whether the gut microbiome and its metabolites contribute to statin-associated glucose intolerance, we recruited 30 patients with atorvastatin and 10 controls, followed up for 16 weeks, and found a decreased abundance of the genus Clostridium in feces and altered serum and fecal bile acid profiles among patients with atorvastatin therapy. Animal experiments validated that statin could induce glucose intolerance, and transplantation of Clostridium sp. and supplementation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) could ameliorate statin-induced glucose intolerance. Furthermore, oral UDCA administration in humans alleviated the glucose intolerance without impairing the lipid-lowering effect. Our study demonstrated that the statin-induced hyperglycemic effect was attributed to the Clostridium sp.-bile acids axis and provided important insights into adjuvant therapy of UDCA to lower the adverse risk of statin therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1 or LINE-1) is a highly abundant mobile genetic element in both humans and mice, comprising almost 20% of each genome. L1s are silenced by several mechanisms, as their uncontrolled expression has the potential to induce genomic instability. However, L1s are paradoxically expressed at high levels in differentiating neural progenitor cells. Using in vitro and in vivo techniques to modulate L1 expression, we report that L1s play a critical role in both human and mouse brain development by regulating the rate of neural differentiation in a reverse-transcription-independent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons establish specific synapses based on the adhesive properties of cell-surface proteins while also retaining the ability to form synapses in a relatively non-selective manner. However, comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism reconciling these opposing characteristics remains incomplete. Here, we have identified Side-IV/Beat-IIb, members of the Drosophila immunoglobulin superfamily, as a combination of cell-surface recognition molecules inducing synapse formation. The Side-IV/Beat-IIb combination transduces bifurcated signaling with Side-IV’s co-receptor, Kirre, and a synaptic scaffold protein, Dsyd-1. Genetic experiments and subcellular protein localization analyses showed the Side-IV/Beat-IIb/Kirre/Dsyd-1 complex to have two essential functions. First, it narrows neuronal binding specificity through Side-IV/Beat-IIb extracellular interactions. Second, it recruits synapse formation factors, Kirre and Dsyd-1, to restrict synaptic loci and inhibit miswiring. This dual function explains how the combinations of cell-surface molecules enable the ranking of preferred interactions among neuronal pairs to achieve synaptic specificity in complex circuits in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Synapses preferentially respond to particular temporal patterns of activity with a large degree of heterogeneity that is informally or tacitly separated into classes. Yet, the precise number and properties of such classes are unclear. Do they exist on a continuum and, if so, when is it appropriate to divide that continuum into functional regions? In a large dataset of glutamatergic cortical connections, we perform model-based characterization to infer the number and characteristics of functionally distinct subtypes of synaptic dynamics. In rodent data, we find five clusters that partially converge with transgenic-associated subtypes. Strikingly, the application of the same clustering method in human data infers a highly similar number of clusters, supportive of stable clustering. This nuanced dictionary of functional subtypes shapes the heterogeneity of cortical synaptic dynamics and provides a lens into the basic motifs of information transmission in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
Inherited metabolic disorders are a group of genetic conditions that can cause severe neurological impairment and child mortality. Uniquely, these disorders respond to dietary treatment; however, this option remains largely unexplored because of low disorder prevalence and the lack of a suitable paradigm for testing diets. Here, we screened 35 Drosophila amino acid disorder models for disease-diet interactions and found 26 with diet-altered development and/or survival. Using a targeted multi-nutrient array, we examine the interaction in a model of isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency, an infant-lethal disorder. We show that dietary cysteine depletion normalizes their metabolic profile and rescues development, neurophysiology, behavior, and lifelong fly survival, thus providing a basis for further study into the pathogenic mechanisms involved in this disorder. Our work highlights the diet-sensitive nature of metabolic disorders and establishes Drosophila as a valuable tool for nutrigenomic studies for informing potential dietary therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the cell-type composition and spatial organization of brain regions is crucial for interpreting brain computation and function. In the thalamus, the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) are involved in a wide variety of functions, yet the cell-type composition of the ATN remains unmapped at a single-cell and spatial resolution. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization, we identify three discrete excitatory cell-type clusters that correspond to the known nuclei of the ATN and uncover marker genes, molecular pathways, and putative functions of these cell types. We further illustrate graded spatial variation along the dorsomedial-ventrolateral axis for all individual nuclei of the ATN and additionally demonstrate that the anteroventral nucleus exhibits spatially covarying protein products and long-range inputs. Collectively, our study reveals discrete and continuous cell-type organizational principles of the ATN, which will help to guide and interpret experiments on ATN computation and function.

Abstract: Summary
Although the composition and assembly of stress granules (SGs) are well understood, the molecular mechanisms underlying SG disassembly remain unclear. Here, we identify that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2B1) is associated with SGs and that its absence specifically enhances the disassembly of arsenite-induced SGs depending on the ubiquitination-proteasome system but not the autophagy pathway. hnRNPA2B1 interacts with many core SG proteins, including G3BP1, G3BP2, USP10, and Caprin-1; USP10 can deubiquitinate G3BP1; and hnRNPA2B1 depletion attenuates the G3BP1-USP10/Caprin-1 interaction but elevates the G3BP1 ubiquitination level under arsenite treatment. Moreover, the disease-causing mutation FUSR521C also disassembles faster from SGs in HNRNPA2B1 mutant cells. Furthermore, knockout of hnRNPA2B1 in mice leads to Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS), causing complete male infertility. Consistent with this, arsenite-induced SGs disassemble faster in Hnrnpa2b1 knockout (KO) mouse Sertoli cells as well. These findings reveal the essential roles of hnRNPA2B1 in regulating SG disassembly and male mouse fertility.

Abstract: Summary
The ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) pathway acts as a translational surveillance mechanism to maintain proteostasis. In mammalian cells, the cytoplasmic RQC pathway involves nuclear export mediator factor (NEMF)-dependent recruitment of the E3 ligase Listerin to ubiquitinate ribosome-stalled nascent polypeptides on the lysine residue for degradation. However, the quality control of ribosome-stalled nuclear-encoded mitochondrial nascent polypeptides remains elusive, as these peptides can be partially imported into mitochondria through translocons, restricting accessibility to the lysine by Listerin. Here, we identify a Listerin-independent organelle-specific mitochondrial RQC pathway that acts on NEMF-mediated carboxy-terminal poly-alanine modification. In the pathway, mitochondrial proteins carrying C-end poly-Ala tails are recognized by the cytosolic E3 ligase Pirh2 and the ClpXP protease in the mitochondria, which coordinately clear ribosome-stalled mitochondrial nascent polypeptides. Defects in this elimination pathway result in NEMF-mediated aggregates and mitochondrial integrity failure, thus providing a potential molecular mechanism of the RQC pathway in mitochondrial-associated human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The lipid droplet (LD) organization proteins Ldo16 and Ldo45 affect multiple aspects of LD biology in yeast. They are linked to the LD biogenesis machinery seipin, and their loss causes defects in LD positioning, protein targeting, and breakdown. However, their molecular roles remained enigmatic. Here, we report that Ldo16/45 form a tether complex with Vac8 to create vacuole lipid droplet (vCLIP) contact sites, which can form in the absence of seipin. The phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) Pdr16 is a further vCLIP-resident recruited specifically by Ldo45. While only an LD subpopulation is engaged in vCLIPs at glucose-replete conditions, nutrient deprivation results in vCLIP expansion, and vCLIP defects impair lipophagy upon prolonged starvation. In summary, Ldo16/45 are multifunctional proteins that control the formation of a metabolically regulated contact site. Our studies suggest a link between LD biogenesis and breakdown and contribute to a deeper understanding of how lipid homeostasis is maintained during metabolic challenges.

Abstract: Summary
Phagocytes remove dead and dying cells by engaging “eat-me” ligands such as phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on the surface of apoptotic targets. However, PtdSer is obscured by the bulky exofacial glycocalyx, which also exposes ligands that activate “don’t-eat-me” receptors such as Siglecs. Clearly, unshielding the juxtamembrane “eat-me” ligands is required for the successful engulfment of apoptotic cells, but the mechanisms underlying this process have not been described. Using human and murine cells, we find that apoptosis-induced retraction and weakening of the cytoskeleton that anchors transmembrane proteins cause an inhomogeneous redistribution of the glycocalyx: actin-depleted blebs emerge, lacking the glycocalyx, while the rest of the apoptotic cell body retains sufficient actin to tether the glycocalyx in place. Thus, apoptotic blebs can be engaged by phagocytes and are targeted for engulfment. Therefore, in cells with an elaborate glycocalyx, such as mucinous cancer cells, this “don’t-come-close-to-me” barrier must be removed to enable clearance by phagocytosis.

Abstract: Summary
Micronuclei (MN) are induced by various genotoxic stressors and amass nuclear- and cytoplasmic-resident proteins, priming the cell for MN-driven signaling cascades. Here, we measured the proteome of micronuclear, cytoplasmic, and nuclear fractions from human cells exposed to a panel of six genotoxins, comprehensively profiling their MN protein landscape. We find that MN assemble a proteome distinct from both surrounding cytoplasm and parental nuclei, depleted of spliceosome and DNA damage repair components while enriched for a subset of the replisome. We show that the depletion of splicing machinery within transcriptionally active MN contributes to intra-MN DNA damage, a known precursor to chromothripsis. The presence of transcription machinery in MN is stress-dependent, causing a contextual induction of MN DNA damage through spliceosome deficiency. This dataset represents a unique resource detailing the global proteome of MN, guiding mechanistic studies of MN generation and MN-associated outcomes of genotoxic stress.

Abstract: Summary
SLC25A51 selectively imports oxidized NAD+ into the mitochondrial matrix and is required for sustaining cell respiration. We observed elevated expression of SLC25A51 that correlated with poorer outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and we sought to determine the role SLC25A51 may serve in this disease. We found that lowering SLC25A51 levels led to increased apoptosis and prolonged survival in orthotopic xenograft models. Metabolic flux analyses indicated that depletion of SLC25A51 shunted flux away from mitochondrial oxidative pathways, notably without increased glycolytic flux. Depletion of SLC25A51 combined with 5-azacytidine treatment limits expansion of AML cells in vivo. Together, the data indicate that AML cells upregulate SLC25A51 to decouple mitochondrial NAD+/NADH for a proliferative advantage by supporting oxidative reactions from a variety of fuels. Thus, SLC25A51 represents a critical regulator that can be exploited by cancer cells and may be a vulnerability for refractory AML.

Abstract: Summary
Single-molecule imaging inside living cells has revealed that transcription factors (TFs) bind to DNA transiently, but a long-standing question is how this transient binding is related to transcription activation. Here, we devised a microscopy method to simultaneously measure transient TF binding at a single locus and the effect of these binding events on transcription. We show that DNA binding of the yeast TF Gal4 activates transcription of a target gene within a few seconds, with at least ∼20% efficiency and with a high initiation rate of ∼1 RNA/s. Gal4 DNA dissociation decreases transcription rapidly. Moreover, at a gene with multiple binding sites, individual Gal4 molecules only rarely stay bound throughout the entire burst but instead frequently exchange during a burst to increase the transcriptional burst duration. Our results suggest a mechanism for enhancer regulation in more complex eukaryotes, where TF cooperativity and exchange enable robust and responsive transcription regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Jasmonate (JA) is a well-known phytohormone essential for plant response to biotic stress. Recently, a crucial role of JA signaling in salt resistance has been highlighted; however, the specific regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that the NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y (NF-Y) subunits NF-YA1, NF-YB2, and NF-YC9 form a trimeric complex that positively regulates the expression of salinity-responsive genes, whereas JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN protein 8 (JAZ8) directly interacts with three subunits and acts as the key repressor to suppress both the assembly of the NF-YA1-YB2-YC9 trimeric complex and the transcriptional activation activity of the complex. When plants encounter high salinity, JA levels are elevated and perceived by the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE (COI) 1 receptor, leading to the degradation of JAZ8 via the 26S proteasome pathway, thereby releasing the activity of the NF-YA1-YB2-YC9 complex, initiating the activation of salinity-responsive genes, such as MYB75, and thus enhancing the salinity tolerance of plants.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint inhibitors exert clinical efficacy against various types of cancer through reinvigoration of exhausted CD8+ T cells that attack cancer cells directly in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Using single-cell sequencing and mouse models, we show that CXCL13, highly expressed in tumor-infiltrating exhausted CD8+ T cells, induces CD4+ follicular helper T (TFH) cell infiltration, contributing to anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, a part of the TFH cells in the TME exhibits cytotoxicity and directly attacks major histocompatibility complex-II-expressing tumors. TFH-like cytotoxic CD4+ T cells have high LAG-3/BLIMP1 and low TCF1 expression without self-renewal ability, whereas non-cytotoxic TFH cells express low LAG-3/BLIMP1 and high TCF1 with self-renewal ability, closely resembling the relationship between terminally differentiated and stem-like progenitor exhaustion in CD8+ T cells, respectively. Our findings provide deep insights into TFH-like CD4+ T cell exhaustion with helper progenitor and cytotoxic differentiated functions, mediating anti-tumor immunity orchestrally with CD8+ T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Short-term memory (STM) maintains information during a short delay period. How long-range and local connections interact to support STM encoding remains elusive. Here, we tackle the problem focusing on long-range projections from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the anterior agranular insular cortex (aAIC) in head-fixed mice performing an olfactory delayed-response task. Optogenetic and electrophysiological experiments reveal the behavioral importance of the two regions in encoding STM information. Spike-correlogram analysis reveals strong local and cross-region functional coupling (FC) between memory neurons encoding the same information. Optogenetic suppression of mPFC-aAIC projections during the delay period reduces behavioral performance, the proportion of memory neurons, and memory-specific FC within the aAIC, whereas optogenetic excitation enhances all of them. mPFC-aAIC projections also bidirectionally modulate the efficacy of STM-information transfer, measured by the contribution of FC spiking pairs to the memory-coding ability of following neurons. Thus, prefrontal projections modulate insular neurons’ functional connectivity and memory-coding ability to support STM.

Abstract: Summary
Microbial metabolites that can modulate neurodegeneration are promising therapeutic targets. Here, we found that the short-chain fatty acid propionate protects against α-synuclein-induced neuronal death and locomotion defects in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) through bidirectional regulation between the intestine and neurons. Both depletion of dietary vitamin B12, which induces propionate breakdown, and propionate supplementation suppress neurodegeneration and reverse PD-associated transcriptomic aberrations. Neuronal α-synuclein aggregation induces intestinal mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mitoUPR), which leads to reduced propionate levels that trigger transcriptional reprogramming in the intestine and cause defects in energy production. Weakened intestinal metabolism exacerbates neurodegeneration through interorgan signaling. Genetically enhancing propionate production or overexpressing metabolic regulators downstream of propionate in the intestine rescues neurodegeneration, which then relieves mitoUPR. Importantly, propionate supplementation suppresses neurodegeneration without reducing α-synuclein aggregation, demonstrating metabolic rescue of neuronal proteotoxicity downstream of protein aggregates. Our study highlights the involvement of small metabolites in the gut-brain interaction in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Motivation-driven mating is a basic affair for the maintenance of species. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that control mating motivation are not fully understood. Here, we report that NRG1-ErbB4 signaling in the medial amygdala (MeA) is pivotal in regulating mating motivation. NRG1 expression in the MeA negatively correlates with the mating motivation levels in adult male mice. Local injection and knockdown of MeA NRG1 reduce and promote mating motivation, respectively. Consistently, knockdown of MeA ErbB4, a major receptor for NRG1, and genetic inactivation of its kinase both promote mating motivation. ErbB4 deletion decreases neuronal excitability, whereas chemogenetic manipulations of ErbB4-positive neuronal activities bidirectionally modulate mating motivation. We also identify that the effects of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling on neuronal excitability and mating motivation rely on hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 3. This study reveals a critical molecular mechanism for regulating mating motivation in adult male mice.
