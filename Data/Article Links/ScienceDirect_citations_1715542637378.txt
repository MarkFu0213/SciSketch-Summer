Abstract: Summary
Multiple COVID-19 vaccines, representing diverse vaccine platforms, successfully protect against symptomatic COVID-19 cases and deaths. Head-to-head comparisons of T cell, B cell, and antibody responses to diverse vaccines in humans are likely to be informative for understanding protective immunity against COVID-19, with particular interest in immune memory. Here, SARS-CoV-2-spike-specific immune responses to Moderna mRNA-1273, Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2, Janssen Ad26.COV2.S, and Novavax NVX-CoV2373 were examined longitudinally for 6 months 100% of individuals made memory CD4+ T cells, with cTfh and CD4-CTL highly represented after mRNA or NVX-CoV2373 vaccination. mRNA vaccines and Ad26.COV2.S induced comparable CD8+ T cell frequencies, though only detectable in 60–67% of subjects at 6 months. A differentiating feature of Ad26.COV2.S immunization was a high frequency of CXCR3+ memory B cells. mRNA vaccinees had substantial declines in antibodies, while memory T and B cells were comparatively stable. These results may also be relevant for insights against other pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Mice deficient for all ten-eleven translocation (TET) genes exhibit early gastrulation lethality. However, separating cause and effect in such embryonic failure is challenging. To isolate cell-autonomous effects of TET loss, we used temporal single-cell atlases from embryos with partial or complete mutant contributions. Strikingly, when developing within a wild-type embryo, Tet-mutant cells retain near-complete differentiation potential, whereas embryos solely comprising mutant cells are defective in epiblast to ectoderm transition with degenerated mesoderm potential. We map de-repressions of early epiblast factors (e.g., Dppa4 and Gdf3) and failure to activate multiple signaling from nascent mesoderm (Lefty, FGF, and Notch) as likely cell-intrinsic drivers of TET loss phenotypes. We further suggest loss of enhancer demethylation as the underlying mechanism. Collectively, our work demonstrates an unbiased approach for defining intrinsic and extrinsic embryonic gene function based on temporal differentiation atlases and disentangles the intracellular effects of the demethylation machinery from its broader tissue-level ramifications.

Abstract: Summary
Although mutations in mitochondrial-associated genes are linked to inflammation and susceptibility to infection, their mechanistic contributions to immune outcomes remain ill-defined. We discovered that the disease-associated gain-of-function allele Lrrk2G2019S (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) perturbs mitochondrial homeostasis and reprograms cell death pathways in macrophages. When the inflammasome is activated in Lrrk2G2019S macrophages, elevated mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) directs association of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) to mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondrial GSDMD pore formation then releases mtROS, promoting a switch to RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis. Consistent with enhanced necroptosis, infection of Lrrk2G2019S mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis elicits hyperinflammation and severe immunopathology. Our findings suggest a pivotal role for GSDMD as an executer of multiple cell death pathways and demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction can direct immune outcomes via cell death modality switching. This work provides insights into how LRRK2 mutations manifest or exacerbate human diseases and identifies GSDMD-dependent necroptosis as a potential target to limit Lrrk2G2019S-mediated immunopathology.

Abstract: Summary
RNA quality control relies on co-factors and adaptors to identify and prepare substrates for degradation by ribonucleases such as the 3′ to 5′ ribonucleolytic RNA exosome. Here, we determined cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complexes bound to RNA that reveal mechanistic insights to substrate recognition and early steps that precede RNA handover to the exosome. The structures illuminate ZCCHC8 as a scaffold, mediating homodimerization while embracing the MTR4 helicase and flexibly anchoring RBM7 to the helicase core. All three subunits collaborate to bind the RNA, with RBM7 and ZCCHC8 surveying sequences upstream of the 3′ end to facilitate RNA capture by MTR4. ZCCHC8 obscures MTR4 surfaces important for RNA binding and extrusion as well as MPP6-dependent recruitment and docking onto the RNA exosome core, interactions that contribute to RNA surveillance by coordinating RNA capture, translocation, and extrusion from the helicase to the exosome for decay.

Abstract: Summary
The host-seeking activity of hematophagous arthropods is essential for arboviral transmission. Here, we demonstrate that mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses can manipulate host skin microbiota to produce a scent that attracts mosquitoes. We observed that Aedes mosquitoes preferred to seek and feed on mice infected by dengue and Zika viruses. Acetophenone, a volatile compound that is predominantly produced by the skin microbiota, was enriched in the volatiles from the infected hosts to potently stimulate mosquito olfaction for attractiveness. Of note, acetophenone emission was higher in dengue patients than in healthy people. Mechanistically, flaviviruses infection suppressed the expression of RELMα, an essential antimicrobial protein on host skin, thereby leading to the expansion of acetophenone-producing commensal bacteria and, consequently, a high acetophenone level. Given that RELMα can be specifically induced by a vitamin A derivative, the dietary administration of isotretinoin to flavivirus-infected animals interrupted flavivirus life cycle by reducing mosquito host-seeking activity, thus providing a strategy of arboviral control.

Abstract: Summary
During development, melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) become light sensitive much earlier than rods and cones. IpRGCs project to many subcortical areas, whereas physiological functions of these projections are yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that ipRGC-mediated light sensation promotes synaptogenesis of pyramidal neurons in various cortices and the hippocampus. This phenomenon depends on activation of ipRGCs and is mediated by the release of oxytocin from the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) into cerebral-spinal fluid. We further characterized a direct connection between ipRGCs and oxytocin neurons in the SON and mutual projections between oxytocin neurons in the SON and PVN. Moreover, we showed that the lack of ipRGC-mediated, light-promoted early cortical synaptogenesis compromised learning ability in adult mice. Our results highlight the importance of light sensation early in life on the development of learning ability and therefore call attention to suitable light environment for infant care.

Abstract: Summary
The young circulatory milieu capable of delaying aging in individual tissues is of interest as rejuvenation strategies, but how it achieves cellular- and systemic-level effects has remained unclear. Here, we constructed a single-cell transcriptomic atlas across aged tissues/organs and their rejuvenation in heterochronic parabiosis (HP), a classical model to study systemic aging. In general, HP rejuvenated adult stem cells and their niches across tissues. In particular, we identified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) as one of the most responsive cell types to young blood exposure, from which a continuum of cell state changes across the hematopoietic and immune system emanated, through the restoration of a youthful transcriptional regulatory program and cytokine-mediated cell-cell communications in HSPCs. Moreover, the reintroduction of the identified rejuvenating factors alleviated age-associated lymphopoiesis decline. Overall, we provide comprehensive frameworks to explore aging and rejuvenating trajectories at single-cell resolution and revealed cellular and molecular programs that instruct systemic revitalization by blood-borne factors.

Abstract: Summary
Live bacterial therapeutics (LBTs) could reverse diseases by engrafting in the gut and providing persistent beneficial functions in the host. However, attempts to functionally manipulate the gut microbiome of conventionally raised (CR) hosts have been unsuccessful because engineered microbial organisms (i.e., chassis) have difficulty in colonizing the hostile luminal environment. In this proof-of-concept study, we use native bacteria as chassis for transgene delivery to impact CR host physiology. Native Escherichia coli bacteria isolated from the stool cultures of CR mice were modified to express functional genes. The reintroduction of these strains induces perpetual engraftment in the intestine. In addition, engineered native E. coli can induce functional changes that affect physiology of and reverse pathology in CR hosts months after administration. Thus, using native bacteria as chassis to “knock in” specific functions allows mechanistic studies of specific microbial activities in the microbiome of CR hosts and enables LBT with curative intent.

Abstract: Summary
The Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2, which was first described in November 2021, spread rapidly to become globally dominant and has split into a number of sublineages. BA.1 dominated the initial wave but has been replaced by BA.2 in many countries. Recent sequencing from South Africa’s Gauteng region uncovered two new sublineages, BA.4 and BA.5, which are taking over locally, driving a new wave. BA.4 and BA.5 contain identical spike sequences, and although closely related to BA.2, they contain further mutations in the receptor-binding domain of their spikes. Here, we study the neutralization of BA.4/5 using a range of vaccine and naturally immune serum and panels of monoclonal antibodies. BA.4/5 shows reduced neutralization by the serum from individuals vaccinated with triple doses of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine compared with BA.1 and BA.2. Furthermore, using the serum from BA.1 vaccine breakthrough infections, there are, likewise, significant reductions in the neutralization of BA.4/5, raising the possibility of repeat Omicron infections.

Abstract: Summary
X inactivation (XCI) is triggered by upregulation of XIST, which coats the chromosome in cis, promoting formation of a heterochromatic domain (Xi). XIST role beyond initiation of XCI is only beginning to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that XIST loss impairs differentiation of human mammary stem cells (MaSCs) and promotes emergence of highly tumorigenic and metastatic carcinomas. On the Xi, XIST deficiency triggers epigenetic changes and reactivation of genes overlapping Polycomb domains, including Mediator subunit MED14. MED14 overdosage results in increased Mediator levels and hyperactivation of the MaSC enhancer landscape and transcriptional program, making differentiation less favorable. We further demonstrate that loss of XIST and Xi transcriptional instability is common among human breast tumors of poor prognosis. We conclude that XIST is a gatekeeper of human mammary epithelium homeostasis, thus unveiling a paradigm in the control of somatic cell identity with potential consequences for our understanding of gender-specific malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
Barrier epithelia depend upon resident stem cells for homeostasis, defense, and repair. Epithelial stem cells of small and large intestines (ISCs) respond to their local microenvironments (niches) to fulfill a continuous demand for tissue turnover. The complexity of these niches and underlying communication pathways are not fully known. Here, we report a lymphatic network at the intestinal crypt base that intimately associates with ISCs. Employing in vivo loss of function and lymphatic:organoid cocultures, we show that crypt lymphatics maintain ISCs and inhibit their precocious differentiation. Pairing single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we apply BayesPrism to deconvolve expression within spatial features and develop SpaceFold to robustly map the niche at high resolution, exposing lymphatics as a central signaling hub for the crypt in general and ISCs in particular. We identify WNT-signaling factors (WNT2, R-SPONDIN-3) and a hitherto unappreciated extracellular matrix protein, REELIN, as crypt lymphatic signals that directly govern the regenerative potential of ISCs.

Abstract: Summary
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor-neuron disease caused by mutations of the SMN1 gene. The human paralog SMN2, whose exon 7 (E7) is predominantly skipped, cannot compensate for the lack of SMN1. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that upregulates E7 inclusion and SMN protein levels by displacing the splicing repressors hnRNPA1/A2 from their target site in intron 7. We show that by promoting transcriptional elongation, the histone deacetylase inhibitor VPA cooperates with a nusinersen-like ASO to promote E7 inclusion. Surprisingly, the ASO promotes the deployment of the silencing histone mark H3K9me2 on the SMN2 gene, creating a roadblock to RNA polymerase II elongation that inhibits E7 inclusion. By removing the roadblock, VPA counteracts the chromatin effects of the ASO, resulting in higher E7 inclusion without large pleiotropic effects. Combined administration of the nusinersen-like ASO and VPA in SMA mice strongly synergizes SMN expression, growth, survival, and neuromuscular function.

Abstract: Summary
Adult stem cells constantly react to local changes to ensure tissue homeostasis. In the main body of the stomach, chief cells produce digestive enzymes; however, upon injury, they undergo rapid proliferation for prompt tissue regeneration. Here, we identified p57Kip2 (p57) as a molecular switch for the reserve stem cell state of chief cells in mice. During homeostasis, p57 is constantly expressed in chief cells but rapidly diminishes after injury, followed by robust proliferation. Both single-cell RNA sequencing and dox-induced lineage tracing confirmed the sequential loss of p57 and activation of proliferation within the chief cell lineage. In corpus organoids, p57 overexpression induced a long-term reserve stem cell state, accompanied by altered niche requirements and a mature chief cell/secretory phenotype. Following the constitutive expression of p57 in vivo, chief cells showed an impaired injury response. Thus, p57 is a gatekeeper that imposes the reserve stem cell state of chief cells in homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming somatic cells into megakaryocytes (MKs) would provide a promising source of platelets. However, using a pharmacological approach to generate human MKs from somatic cells remains an unmet challenge. Here, we report that a combination of four small molecules (4M) successfully converted human cord blood erythroblasts (EBs) into induced MKs (iMKs). The iMKs could produce proplatelets and release functional platelets, functionally resembling natural MKs. Reprogramming trajectory analysis revealed an efficient cell fate conversion of EBs into iMKs by 4M via the intermediate state of bipotent precursors. 4M induced chromatin remodeling and drove the transition of transcription factor (TF) regulatory network from key erythroid TFs to essential TFs for megakaryopoiesis, including FLI1 and MEIS1. These results demonstrate that the chemical reprogramming of cord blood EBs into iMKs provides a simple and efficient approach to generate MKs and platelets for clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
The centromere represents a single region in most eukaryotic chromosomes. However, several plant and animal lineages assemble holocentromeres along the entire chromosome length. Here, we compare genome organization and evolution as a function of centromere type by assembling chromosome-scale holocentric genomes with repeat-based holocentromeres from three beak-sedge (Rhynchospora pubera, R. breviuscula, and R. tenuis) and their closest monocentric relative, Juncus effusus. We demonstrate that transition to holocentricity affected 3D genome architecture by redefining genomic compartments, while distributing centromere function to thousands of repeat-based centromere units genome-wide. We uncover a complex genome organization in R. pubera that hides its unexpected octoploidy and describe a marked reduction in chromosome number for R. tenuis, which has only two chromosomes. We show that chromosome fusions, facilitated by repeat-based holocentromeres, promoted karyotype evolution and diploidization. Our study thus sheds light on several important aspects of genome architecture and evolution influenced by centromere organization.

Abstract: Summary
2′,3′-cAMP is a positional isomer of the well-established second messenger 3′,5′-cAMP, but little is known about the biology of this noncanonical cyclic nucleotide monophosphate (cNMP). Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors have the NADase function necessary but insufficient to activate plant immune responses. Here, we show that plant TIR proteins, besides being NADases, act as 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP synthetases by hydrolyzing RNA/DNA. Structural data show that a TIR domain adopts distinct oligomers with mutually exclusive NADase and synthetase activity. Mutations specifically disrupting the synthetase activity abrogate TIR-mediated cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb), supporting an important role for these cNMPs in TIR signaling. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis negative regulator of TIR-NLR signaling, NUDT7, displays 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP but not 3′,5′-cAMP/cGMP phosphodiesterase activity and suppresses cell death activity of TIRs in Nb. Our study identifies a family of 2′,3′-cAMP/cGMP synthetases and establishes a critical role for them in plant immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
H3K9me3, as a hallmark of heterochromatin, is important for cell-fate specification. However, it remains unknown how H3K9me3 is reprogrammed during human early embryo development. Here, we profiled genome-wide H3K9me3 in human oocytes and early embryos and discovered stage-specific H3K9me3 deposition on long terminal repeats (LTRs) at the 8-cell and blastocyst stages. We found that 8-cell-specific H3K9me3 was temporarily established in enhancer-like regions, whereas blastocyst-specific H3K9me3 was more stable. DUX and multiple Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger proteins(KRAB-ZNFs) were identified as potential factors for establishing 8C- and blastocyst-specific H3K9me3, respectively. Intriguingly, our analysis showed that stage-specific H3K9me3 allocation was attenuated by either Dux knockout or Zfp51 knockdown in mouse early embryos. Moreover, we observed the existence of H3K4me3/H3K9me3 and H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent chromatin domains in human blastocysts, priming for lineage differentiation. Together, our data unveil that the epigenetic switch from DNA methylation to H3K9me3 ensures the precise regulation of retrotransposons in human pre-implantation embryos.

Abstract: Summary
Non-allelic recombination between homologous repetitive elements contributes to evolution and human genetic disorders. Here, we combine short- and long-DNA read sequencing of repeat elements with a new bioinformatics pipeline to show that somatic recombination of Alu and L1 elements is widespread in the human genome. Our analysis uncovers tissue-specific non-allelic homologous recombination hallmarks; moreover, we find that centromeres and cancer-associated genes are enriched for retroelements that may act as recombination hotspots. We compare recombination profiles in human-induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiated neurons and find that the neuron-specific recombination of repeat elements accompanies chromatin changes during cell-fate determination. Finally, we report that somatic recombination profiles are altered in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting a link between retroelement recombination and genomic instability in neurodegeneration. This work highlights a significant contribution of the somatic recombination of repeat elements to genomic diversity in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
The 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) is the largest fully open resource of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data consented for public distribution without access or use restrictions. The final, phase 3 release of the 1kGP included 2,504 unrelated samples from 26 populations and was based primarily on low-coverage WGS. Here, we present a high-coverage 3,202-sample WGS 1kGP resource, which now includes 602 complete trios, sequenced to a depth of 30X using Illumina. We performed single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and short insertion and deletion (INDEL) discovery and generated a comprehensive set of structural variants (SVs) by integrating multiple analytic methods through a machine learning model. We show gains in sensitivity and precision of variant calls compared to phase 3, especially among rare SNVs as well as INDELs and SVs spanning frequency spectrum. We also generated an improved reference imputation panel, making variants discovered here accessible for association studies.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor evolution is driven by the progressive acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations that enable uncontrolled growth and expansion to neighboring and distal tissues. The study of phylogenetic relationships between cancer cells provides key insights into these processes. Here, we introduced an evolving lineage-tracing system with a single-cell RNA-seq readout into a mouse model of Kras;Trp53(KP)-driven lung adenocarcinoma and tracked tumor evolution from single-transformed cells to metastatic tumors at unprecedented resolution. We found that the loss of the initial, stable alveolar-type2-like state was accompanied by a transient increase in plasticity. This was followed by the adoption of distinct transcriptional programs that enable rapid expansion and, ultimately, clonal sweep of stable subclones capable of metastasizing. Finally, tumors develop through stereotypical evolutionary trajectories, and perturbing additional tumor suppressors accelerates progression by creating novel trajectories. Our study elucidates the hierarchical nature of tumor evolution and, more broadly, enables in-depth studies of tumor progression.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomes require an acidic lumen between pH 4.5 and 5.0 for effective digestion of macromolecules. This pH optimum is maintained by proton influx produced by the V-ATPase and efflux through an unidentified “H+ leak” pathway. Here we show that TMEM175, a genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD), mediates the lysosomal H+ leak by acting as a proton-activated, proton-selective channel on the lysosomal membrane (LyPAP). Acidification beyond the normal range potently activated LyPAP to terminate further acidification of lysosomes. An endogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid and synthetic agonists also activated TMEM175 to trigger lysosomal proton release. TMEM175 deficiency caused lysosomal over-acidification, impaired proteolytic activity, and facilitated α-synuclein aggregation in vivo. Mutational and pH normalization analyses indicated that the channel’s H+ conductance is essential for normal lysosome function. Thus, modulation of LyPAP by cellular cues may dynamically tune the pH optima of endosomes and lysosomes to regulate lysosomal degradation and PD pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse germline cysts, on average, develop into six oocytes supported by 24 nurse cells that transfer cytoplasm and organelles to generate a Balbiani body. We showed that between E14.5 and P5, cysts periodically activate some nurse cells to begin cytoplasmic transfer, which causes them to shrink and turnover within 2 days. Nurse cells die by a programmed cell death (PCD) pathway involving acidification, similar to Drosophila nurse cells, and only infrequently by apoptosis. Prior to initiating transfer, nurse cells co-cluster by scRNA-seq with their pro-oocyte sisters, but during their final 2 days, they cluster separately. The genes promoting oocyte development and nurse cell PCD are upregulated, whereas the genes that repress transfer, such as Tex14, and oocyte factors, such as Nobox and Lhx8, are under-expressed. The transferred nurse cell centrosomes build a cytocentrum that establishes a large microtubule aster in the primordial oocyte that organizes the Balbiani body, defining the earliest oocyte polarity.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells are featured with uncontrollable activation of cell cycle, and microRNA deficiency drives tumorigenesis. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) is essential for small-RNA-mediated immune response in plants but is absent in vertebrates. Here, we show that ectopic expression of plant RDR1 can generally inhibit cancer cell proliferation. In many human primary tumors, abnormal microRNA isoforms with 1-nt-shorter 3′ ends are widely accumulated. RDR1 with nucleotidyltransferase activity can recognize and modify the problematic AGO2-free microRNA duplexes with mononucleotides to restore their 2 nt overhang structure, which eventually rescues AGO2-loading efficiency and elevates global miRNA expression to inhibit cancer cell-cycle specifically. The broad antitumor effects of RDR1, which can be delivered by an adeno-associated virus, are visualized in multiple xenograft tumor models in vivo. Altogether, we reveal the widespread accumulation of aberrant microRNA isoforms in tumors and develop a plant RDR1-mediated antitumor stratagem by editing and repairing defective microRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease involving multiple immune cells. To elucidate SLE pathogenesis, it is essential to understand the dysregulated gene expression pattern linked to various clinical statuses with a high cellular resolution. Here, we conducted a large-scale transcriptome study with 6,386 RNA sequencing data covering 27 immune cell types from 136 SLE and 89 healthy donors. We profiled two distinct cell-type-specific transcriptomic signatures: disease-state and disease-activity signatures, reflecting disease establishment and exacerbation, respectively. We then identified candidate biological processes unique to each signature. This study suggested the clinical value of disease-activity signatures, which were associated with organ involvement and therapeutic responses. However, disease-activity signatures were less enriched around SLE risk variants than disease-state signatures, suggesting that current genetic studies may not well capture clinically vital biology. Together, we identified comprehensive gene signatures of SLE, which will provide essential foundations for future genomic and genetic studies.

Abstract: Summary
Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) ectopically express thousands of peripheral-tissue antigens (PTAs), which drive deletion or phenotypic diversion of self-reactive immature T cells during thymic differentiation. Failure of PTA expression causes multiorgan autoimmunity. By assaying chromatin accessibility in individual mTECs, we uncovered signatures of lineage-defining transcription factors (TFs) for skin, lung, liver, and intestinal cells—including Grhl, FoxA, FoxJ1, Hnf4, Sox8, and SpiB—in distinct mTEC subtypes. Transcriptomic and histologic analyses showed that these subtypes, which we collectively term mimetic cells, expressed PTAs in a biologically logical fashion, mirroring extra-thymic cell types while maintaining mTEC identity. Lineage-defining TFs bound to mimetic-cell open chromatin regions and were required for mimetic cell accumulation, whereas the tolerogenic factor Aire was partially and variably required. Expression of a model antigen in mimetic cells sufficed to induce cognate T cell tolerance. Thus, mTECs co-opt lineage-defining TFs to drive mimetic cell accumulation, PTA expression, and self-tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal homeostasis is underpinned by LGR5+ve crypt-base columnar stem cells (CBCs), but following injury, dedifferentiation results in the emergence of LGR5−ve regenerative stem cell populations (RSCs), characterized by fetal transcriptional profiles. Neoplasia hijacks regenerative signaling, so we assessed the distribution of CBCs and RSCs in mouse and human intestinal tumors. Using combined molecular-morphological analysis, we demonstrate variable expression of stem cell markers across a range of lesions. The degree of CBC-RSC admixture was associated with both epithelial mutation and microenvironmental signaling disruption and could be mapped across disease molecular subtypes. The CBC-RSC equilibrium was adaptive, with a dynamic response to acute selective pressure, and adaptability was associated with chemoresistance. We propose a fitness landscape model where individual tumors have equilibrated stem cell population distributions along a CBC-RSC phenotypic axis. Cellular plasticity is represented by position shift along this axis and is influenced by cell-intrinsic, extrinsic, and therapeutic selective pressures.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe congenital heart disease with 30% mortality from heart failure (HF) in the first year of life, but the cause of early HF remains unknown. Induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) from patients with HLHS showed that early HF is associated with increased apoptosis, mitochondrial respiration defects, and redox stress from abnormal mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and failed antioxidant response. In contrast, iPSC-CM from patients without early HF showed normal respiration with elevated antioxidant response. Single-cell transcriptomics confirmed that early HF is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These findings indicate that uncompensated oxidative stress underlies early HF in HLHS. Importantly, mitochondrial respiration defects, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were rescued by treatment with sildenafil to inhibit mPTP opening or TUDCA to suppress ER stress. Together these findings point to the potential use of patient iPSC-CM for modeling clinical heart failure and the development of therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Lysosomal amino acid efflux by proton-driven transporters is essential for lysosomal homeostasis, amino acid recycling, mTOR signaling, and maintaining lysosomal pH. To unravel the mechanisms of these transporters, we focus on cystinosin, a prototypical lysosomal amino acid transporter that exports cystine to the cytosol, where its reduction to cysteine supplies this limiting amino acid for diverse fundamental processes and controlling nutrient adaptation. Cystinosin mutations cause cystinosis, a devastating lysosomal storage disease. Here, we present structures of human cystinosin in lumen-open, cytosol-open, and cystine-bound states, which uncover the cystine recognition mechanism and capture the key conformational states of the transport cycle. Our structures, along with functional studies and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopic investigations, reveal the molecular basis for the transporter’s conformational transitions and protonation switch, show conformation-dependent Ragulator-Rag complex engagement, and demonstrate an unexpected activation mechanism. These findings provide molecular insights into lysosomal amino acid efflux and a potential therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) depend on niche factors for their proper function. However, the source of these ISC niche factors and how they support ISCs in vivo remain controversial. Here, we report that ISCs depend on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and RSPO3+GREM1+ fibroblasts (RGFs). In the intestine and colon, LECs are surrounded by RGFs and are located near ISCs at the crypt base. Both LECs and RGFs provide the critical ISC niche factor RSPO3 to support ISCs, where RSPO3 loss in both cell types drastically compromises ISC numbers, villi length, and repair after injury. In response to injury, LEC and RGF numbers expand and produce greater amounts of RSPO3 and other growth/angiocrine factors to foster intestinal repair. We propose that LECs represent a novel niche component for ISCs, which together with RGFs serve as the major in vivo RSPO3 source for ISCs in homeostasis and injury-mediated regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
How mis-regulated chromatin directly impacts human immune disorders is poorly understood. Speckled Protein 140 (SP140) is an immune-restricted PHD and bromodomain-containing epigenetic “reader,” and SP140 loss-of-function mutations associate with Crohn’s disease (CD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, the relevance of these mutations and mechanisms underlying SP140-driven pathogenicity remains unexplored. Using a global proteomic strategy, we identified SP140 as a repressor of topoisomerases (TOPs) that maintains heterochromatin and macrophage fate. In humans and mice, SP140 loss resulted in unleashed TOP activity, de-repression of developmentally silenced genes, and ultimately defective microbe-inducible macrophage transcriptional programs and bacterial killing that drive intestinal pathology. Pharmacological inhibition of TOP1/2 rescued these defects. Furthermore, exacerbated colitis was restored with TOP1/2 inhibitors in Sp140−/− mice, but not wild-type mice, in vivo. Collectively, we identify SP140 as a TOP repressor and reveal repurposing of TOP inhibition to reverse immune diseases driven by SP140 loss.

Abstract: Summary
The isolation of CCoV-HuPn-2018 from a child respiratory swab indicates that more coronaviruses are spilling over to humans than previously appreciated. We determined the structures of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike glycoprotein trimer in two distinct conformational states and showed that its domain 0 recognizes sialosides. We identified that the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike binds canine, feline, and porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) orthologs, which serve as entry receptors, and determined the structure of the receptor-binding B domain in complex with canine APN. The introduction of an oligosaccharide at position N739 of human APN renders cells susceptible to CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike-mediated entry, suggesting that single-nucleotide polymorphisms might account for viral detection in some individuals. Human polyclonal plasma antibodies elicited by HCoV-229E infection and a porcine coronavirus monoclonal antibody inhibit CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike-mediated entry, underscoring the cross-neutralizing activity among ɑ-coronaviruses. These data pave the way for vaccine and therapeutic development targeting this zoonotic pathogen representing the eighth human-infecting coronavirus.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between cells are indispensable for signaling and creating structure. The ability to direct precise cell-cell interactions would be powerful for engineering tissues, understanding signaling pathways, and directing immune cell targeting. In humans, intercellular interactions are mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). However, endogenous CAMs are natively expressed by many cells and tend to have cross-reactivity, making them unsuitable for programming specific interactions. Here, we showcase “helixCAM,” a platform for engineering synthetic CAMs by presenting coiled-coil peptides on the cell surface. helixCAMs were able to create specific cell-cell interactions and direct patterned aggregate formation in bacteria and human cells. Based on coiled-coil interaction principles, we built a set of rationally designed helixCAM libraries, which led to the discovery of additional high-performance helixCAM pairs. We applied this helixCAM toolkit for various multicellular engineering applications, such as spherical layering, adherent cell targeting, and surface patterning.

Abstract: Summary
We use computational design coupled with experimental characterization to systematically investigate the design principles for macrocycle membrane permeability and oral bioavailability. We designed 184 6–12 residue macrocycles with a wide range of predicted structures containing noncanonical backbone modifications and experimentally determined structures of 35; 29 are very close to the computational models. With such control, we show that membrane permeability can be systematically achieved by ensuring all amide (NH) groups are engaged in internal hydrogen bonding interactions. 84 designs over the 6–12 residue size range cross membranes with an apparent permeability greater than 1 × 10−6 cm/s. Designs with exposed NH groups can be made membrane permeable through the design of an alternative isoenergetic fully hydrogen-bonded state favored in the lipid membrane. The ability to robustly design membrane-permeable and orally bioavailable peptides with high structural accuracy should contribute to the next generation of designed macrocycle therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) rapidly sense immune activation, yet their potential interplay with autoreactive T cells in MS is unknown. Here, we report that bone marrow HSPCs are skewed toward myeloid lineage concomitant with the clonal expansion of T cells in MS patients. Lineage tracing in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS, reveals remarkable bone marrow myelopoiesis with an augmented output of neutrophils and Ly6Chigh monocytes that invade the CNS. We found that myelin-reactive T cells preferentially migrate into the bone marrow compartment in a CXCR4-dependent manner. This aberrant bone marrow myelopoiesis involves the CCL5-CCR5 axis and augments CNS inflammation and demyelination. Our study suggests that targeting the bone marrow niche presents an avenue to treat MS and other autoimmune disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are commonly integrated into human diet and presumed to be inert; however, animal studies suggest that they may impact the microbiome and downstream glycemic responses. We causally assessed NNS impacts in humans and their microbiomes in a randomized-controlled trial encompassing 120 healthy adults, administered saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, and stevia sachets for 2 weeks in doses lower than the acceptable daily intake, compared with controls receiving sachet-contained vehicle glucose or no supplement. As groups, each administered NNS distinctly altered stool and oral microbiome and plasma metabolome, whereas saccharin and sucralose significantly impaired glycemic responses. Importantly, gnotobiotic mice conventionalized with microbiomes from multiple top and bottom responders of each of the four NNS-supplemented groups featured glycemic responses largely reflecting those noted in respective human donors, which were preempted by distinct microbial signals, as exemplified by sucralose. Collectively, human NNS consumption may induce person-specific, microbiome-dependent glycemic alterations, necessitating future assessment of clinical implications.

Abstract: Summary
The impact of apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4), the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), on human brain cellular function remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of APOE4 on brain cell types derived from population and isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells, post-mortem brain, and APOE targeted replacement mice. Population and isogenic models demonstrate that APOE4 local haplotype, rather than a single risk allele, contributes to risk. Global transcriptomic analyses reveal human-specific, APOE4-driven lipid metabolic dysregulation in astrocytes and microglia. APOE4 enhances de novo cholesterol synthesis despite elevated intracellular cholesterol due to lysosomal cholesterol sequestration in astrocytes. Further, matrisome dysregulation is associated with upregulated chemotaxis, glial activation, and lipid biosynthesis in astrocytes co-cultured with neurons, which recapitulates altered astrocyte matrisome signaling in human brain. Thus, APOE4 initiates glia-specific cell and non-cell autonomous dysregulation that may contribute to increased AD risk.

Abstract: Summary
Great progress has been made in understanding gut microbiomes’ products and their effects on health and disease. Less attention, however, has been given to the inputs that gut bacteria consume. Here, we quantitatively examine inputs and outputs of the mouse gut microbiome, using isotope tracing. The main input to microbial carbohydrate fermentation is dietary fiber and to branched-chain fatty acids and aromatic metabolites is dietary protein. In addition, circulating host lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and urea (but not glucose or amino acids) feed the gut microbiome. To determine the nutrient preferences across bacteria, we traced into genus-specific bacterial protein sequences. We found systematic differences in nutrient use: most genera in the phylum Firmicutes prefer dietary protein, Bacteroides dietary fiber, and Akkermansia circulating host lactate. Such preferences correlate with microbiome composition changes in response to dietary modifications. Thus, diet shapes the microbiome by promoting the growth of bacteria that preferentially use the ingested nutrients.

Abstract: Summary
A hallmark of primate postimplantation embryogenesis is the specification of extraembryonic mesoderm (EXM) before gastrulation, in contrast to rodents where this tissue is formed only after gastrulation. Here, we discover that naive human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are competent to differentiate into EXM cells (EXMCs). EXMCs are specified by inhibition of Nodal signaling and GSK3B, are maintained by mTOR and BMP4 signaling activity, and their transcriptome and epigenome closely resemble that of human and monkey embryo EXM. EXMCs are mesenchymal, can arise from an epiblast intermediate, and are capable of self-renewal. Thus, EXMCs arising via primate-specific specification between implantation and gastrulation can be modeled in vitro. We also find that most of the rare off-target cells within human blastoids formed by triple inhibition (Kagawa et al., 2021) correspond to EXMCs. Our study impacts our ability to model and study the molecular mechanisms of early human embryogenesis and related defects.

Abstract: Summary
Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have been shown to model clinical response to cancer therapy. However, it remains challenging to use these models to guide timely clinical decisions for cancer patients. Here, we used droplet emulsion microfluidics with temperature control and dead-volume minimization to rapidly generate thousands of micro-organospheres (MOSs) from low-volume patient tissues, which serve as an ideal patient-derived model for clinical precision oncology. A clinical study of recently diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients using an MOS-based precision oncology pipeline reliably assessed tumor drug response within 14 days, a timeline suitable for guiding treatment decisions in the clinic. Furthermore, MOSs capture original stromal cells and allow T cell penetration, providing a clinical assay for testing immuno-oncology (IO) therapies such as PD-1 blockade, bispecific antibodies, and T cell therapies on patient tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Human cholangiocyte organoids show great promise for regenerative therapies and in vitro modeling of bile duct development and diseases. However, the cystic organoids lack the branching morphology of intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBDs). Here, we report establishing human branching cholangiocyte organoid (BRCO) cultures. BRCOs self-organize into complex tubular structures resembling the IHBD architecture. Single-cell transcriptomics and functional analysis showed high similarity to primary cholangiocytes, and importantly, the branching growth mimics aspects of tubular development and is dependent on JAG1/NOTCH2 signaling. When applied to cholangiocarcinoma tumor organoids, the morphology changes to an in vitro morphology like primary tumors. Moreover, these branching cholangiocarcinoma organoids (BRCCAOs) better match the transcriptomic profile of primary tumors and showed increased chemoresistance to gemcitabine and cisplatin. In conclusion, BRCOs recapitulate a complex process of branching morphogenesis in vitro. This provides an improved model to study tubular formation, bile duct functionality, and associated biliary diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Hijacking the cellular protein degradation system offers unique opportunities for drug discovery, as exemplified by proteolysis-targeting chimeras. Despite their great promise for medical chemistry, so far, it has not been possible to reprogram the bacterial degradation machinery to interfere with microbial infections. Here, we develop small-molecule degraders, so-called BacPROTACs, that bind to the substrate receptor of the ClpC:ClpP protease, priming neo-substrates for degradation. In addition to their targeting function, BacPROTACs activate ClpC, transforming the resting unfoldase into its functional state. The induced higher-order oligomer was visualized by cryo-EM analysis, providing a structural snapshot of activated ClpC unfolding a protein substrate. Finally, drug susceptibility and degradation assays performed in mycobacteria demonstrate in vivo activity of BacPROTACs, allowing selective targeting of endogenous proteins via fusion to an established degron. In addition to guiding antibiotic discovery, the BacPROTAC technology presents a versatile research tool enabling the inducible degradation of bacterial proteins.

Abstract: Summary
The precise genetic origins of the first Neolithic farming populations in Europe and Southwest Asia, as well as the processes and the timing of their differentiation, remain largely unknown. Demogenomic modeling of high-quality ancient genomes reveals that the early farmers of Anatolia and Europe emerged from a multiphase mixing of a Southwest Asian population with a strongly bottlenecked western hunter-gatherer population after the last glacial maximum. Moreover, the ancestors of the first farmers of Europe and Anatolia went through a period of extreme genetic drift during their westward range expansion, contributing highly to their genetic distinctiveness. This modeling elucidates the demographic processes at the root of the Neolithic transition and leads to a spatial interpretation of the population history of Southwest Asia and Europe during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene.

Abstract: Summary
The type III-E CRISPR-Cas effector Cas7-11, with dual RNase activities for precursor CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA) processing and crRNA-guided target RNA cleavage, is a new platform for bacterial and mammalian RNA targeting. We report the 2.5-Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy structure of Cas7-11 in complex with a crRNA and its target RNA. Cas7-11 adopts a modular architecture comprising seven domains (Cas7.1–Cas7.4, Cas11, INS, and CTE) and four interdomain linkers. The crRNA 5′ tag is recognized and processed by Cas7.1, whereas the crRNA spacer hybridizes with the target RNA. Consistent with our biochemical data, the catalytic residues for programmable cleavage in Cas7.2 and Cas7.3 neighbor the scissile phosphates before the flipped-out fourth and tenth nucleotides in the target RNA, respectively. Using structural insights, we rationally engineered a compact Cas7-11 variant (Cas7-11S) for single-vector AAV packaging for transcript knockdown in human cells, enabling in vivo Cas7-11 applications.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell gene therapy (HSPC-GT) is proving successful to treat several genetic diseases. HSPCs are mobilized, harvested, genetically corrected ex vivo, and infused, after the administration of toxic myeloablative conditioning to deplete the bone marrow (BM) for the modified cells. We show that mobilizers create an opportunity for seamless engraftment of exogenous cells, which effectively outcompete those mobilized, to repopulate the depleted BM. The competitive advantage results from the rescue during ex vivo culture of a detrimental impact of mobilization on HSPCs and can be further enhanced by the transient overexpression of engraftment effectors exploiting optimized mRNA-based delivery. We show the therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of hyper IgM syndrome and further developed it in human hematochimeric mice, showing its applicability and versatility when coupled with gene transfer and editing strategies. Overall, our findings provide a potentially valuable strategy paving the way to broader and safer use of HSPC-GT.

Abstract: Summary
Wheat crops are frequently devastated by pandemic stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Here, we identify and characterize a wheat receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase gene, TaPsIPK1, that confers susceptibility to this pathogen. PsSpg1, a secreted fungal effector vital for Pst virulence, can bind TaPsIPK1, enhance its kinase activity, and promote its nuclear localization, where it phosphorylates the transcription factor TaCBF1d for gene regulation. The phosphorylation of TaCBF1d switches its transcriptional activity on the downstream genes. CRISPR-Cas9 inactivation of TaPsIPK1 in wheat confers broad-spectrum resistance against Pst without impacting important agronomic traits in two years of field tests. The disruption of TaPsIPK1 leads to immune priming without constitutive activation of defense responses. Taken together, TaPsIPK1 is a susceptibility gene known to be targeted by rust effectors, and it has great potential for developing durable resistance against rust by genetic modifications.

Abstract: Summary
The currently circulating Omicron sub-variants are the SARS-CoV-2 strains with the highest number of known mutations. Herein, we found that human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) binding affinity to the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the four early Omicron sub-variants (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3) follows the order BA.1.1 > BA.2 > BA.3 ≈ BA.1. The complex structures of hACE2 with RBDs of BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 reveal that the higher hACE2 binding affinity of BA.2 than BA.1 is related to the absence of the G496S mutation in BA.2. The R346K mutation in BA.1.1 majorly affects the interaction network in the BA.1.1 RBD/hACE2 interface through long-range alterations and contributes to the higher hACE2 affinity of the BA.1.1 RBD than the BA.1 RBD. These results reveal the structural basis for the distinct hACE2 binding patterns among BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 RBDs.

Abstract: Summary
2-cell-like cells (2CLCs)—which comprise only ∼1% of murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs)—resemble blastomeres of 2-cell-stage embryos and are used to investigate zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Here, we discovered that TRIM66 and DAX1 function together as negative regulators of the 2C-like state in mESCs. Chimeric assays confirmed that mESCs lacking TRIM66 or DAX1 function have bidirectional embryonic and extraembryonic differentiation potential. TRIM66 functions by recruiting the co-repressor DAX1 to the Dux promoter, and TRIM66’s repressive effect on Dux is dependent on DAX1. A solved crystal structural shows that TRIM66’s PHD finger recognizes H3K4-K9me3, and mutational evidence confirmed that TRIM66’s PHD finger is essential for its repression of Dux. Thus, beyond expanding the scope of known 2CLC regulators, our study demonstrates that interventions disrupting TRIM66 or DAX1 function in mESCs yield 2CLCs with expanded bidirectional differentiation potential, opening doors for the practical application of these totipotent-like cells.

Abstract: Summary
We studied the prevalent cytotoxic CD8 T cell response mounted against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike glycoprotein269-277 epitope (sequence YLQPRTFLL) via the most frequent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I worldwide, HLA A∗02. The Spike P272L mutation that has arisen in at least 112 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages to date, including in lineages classified as “variants of concern,” was not recognized by the large CD8 T cell response seen across cohorts of HLA A∗02+ convalescent patients and individuals vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, despite these responses comprising of over 175 different individual T cell receptors. Viral escape at prevalent T cell epitopes restricted by high frequency HLAs may be particularly problematic when vaccine immunity is focused on a single protein such as SARS-CoV-2 Spike, providing a strong argument for inclusion of multiple viral proteins in next generation vaccines and highlighting the need for monitoring T cell escape in new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Abstract: Summary
Alpha-synuclein (αS) is a conformationally plastic protein that reversibly binds to cellular membranes. It aggregates and is genetically linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we show that αS directly modulates processing bodies (P-bodies), membraneless organelles that function in mRNA turnover and storage. The N terminus of αS, but not other synucleins, dictates mutually exclusive binding either to cellular membranes or to P-bodies in the cytosol. αS associates with multiple decapping proteins in close proximity on the Edc4 scaffold. As αS pathologically accumulates, aberrant interaction with Edc4 occurs at the expense of physiologic decapping-module interactions. mRNA decay kinetics within PD-relevant pathways are correspondingly disrupted in PD patient neurons and brain. Genetic modulation of P-body components alters αS toxicity, and human genetic analysis lends support to the disease-relevance of these interactions. Beyond revealing an unexpected aspect of αS function and pathology, our data highlight the versatility of conformationally plastic proteins with high intrinsic disorder.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatable CAR platforms could circumvent toxicities associated with CAR-T therapy, but existing systems have shortcomings including leakiness and attenuated activity. Here, we present SNIP CARs, a protease-based platform for regulating CAR activity using an FDA-approved small molecule. Design iterations yielded CAR-T cells that manifest full functional capacity with drug and no leaky activity in the absence of drug. In numerous models, SNIP CAR-T cells were more potent than constitutive CAR-T cells and showed diminished T cell exhaustion and greater stemness. In a ROR1-based CAR lethality model, drug cessation following toxicity onset reversed toxicity, thereby credentialing the platform as a safety switch. In the same model, reduced drug dosing opened a therapeutic window that resulted in tumor eradication in the absence of toxicity. SNIP CARs enable remote tuning of CAR activity, which provides solutions to safety and efficacy barriers that are currently limiting progress in using CAR-T cells to treat solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The effects of mutations in continuously emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 are a major concern for the performance of rapid antigen tests. To evaluate the impact of mutations on 17 antibodies used in 11 commercially available antigen tests with emergency use authorization, we measured antibody binding for all possible Nucleocapsid point mutations using a mammalian surface-display platform and deep mutational scanning. The results provide a complete map of the antibodies’ epitopes and their susceptibility to mutational escape. Our data predict no vulnerabilities for detection of mutations found in variants of concern. We confirm this using the commercial tests and sequence-confirmed COVID-19 patient samples. The antibody escape mutational profiles generated here serve as a valuable resource for predicting the performance of rapid antigen tests against past, current, as well as any possible future variants of SARS-CoV-2, establishing the direct clinical and public health utility of our system.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia are critical in brain development and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) etiology. Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic developmental disorder and risk factor for AD. Surprisingly, little information is available on the impact of trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) on microglial functions during DS brain development and in AD in DS. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based organoid and chimeric mouse models, we report that DS microglia exhibit an enhanced synaptic pruning function, which alters neuronal synaptic functions. In response to human brain tissue-derived pathological tau, DS microglia undergo cellular senescence and exhibit elevated type-I-interferon signaling. Mechanistically, knockdown of Hsa21-encoded type I interferon receptors, IFNARs, rescues the DS microglial phenotypes both during brain development and in response to pathological tau. Our findings provide in vivo evidence that human microglia respond to pathological tau by exhibiting dystrophic phenotypes. Targeting IFNARs may improve DS microglial functions and prevent senescence.

Abstract: Summary
Parthanatos-associated apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) nuclease (PAAN), also known as macrophage migration inhibitor factor (MIF), is a member of the PD-D/E(X)K nucleases that acts as a final executioner in parthanatos. PAAN’s role in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and whether it is amenable to chemical inhibition is not known. Here, we show that neurodegeneration induced by pathologic α-synuclein (α-syn) occurs via PAAN/MIF nuclease activity. Genetic depletion of PAAN/MIF and a mutant lacking nuclease activity prevent the loss of dopaminergic neurons and behavioral deficits in the α-syn preformed fibril (PFF) mouse model of sporadic PD. Compound screening led to the identification of PAANIB-1, a brain-penetrant PAAN/MIF nuclease inhibitor that prevents neurodegeneration induced by α-syn PFF, AAV-α-syn overexpression, or MPTP intoxication in vivo. Our findings could have broad relevance in human pathologies where parthanatos plays a role in the development of cell death inhibitors targeting the druggable PAAN/MIF nuclease.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potentially unlimited resource for cell therapies, but the derivation of mature cell types remains challenging. The histone methyltransferase EZH1 is a negative regulator of lymphoid potential during embryonic hematopoiesis. Here, we demonstrate that EZH1 repression facilitates in vitro differentiation and maturation of T cells from iPSCs. Coupling a stroma-free T cell differentiation system with EZH1-knockdown-mediated epigenetic reprogramming, we generated iPSC-derived T cells, termed EZ-T cells, which display a highly diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and mature molecular signatures similar to those of TCRαβ T cells from peripheral blood. Upon activation, EZ-T cells give rise to effector and memory T cell subsets. When transduced with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), EZ-T cells exhibit potent antitumor activities in vitro and in xenograft models. Epigenetic remodeling via EZH1 repression allows efficient production of developmentally mature T cells from iPSCs for applications in adoptive cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Autoantibodies targeting neuronal membrane proteins can cause encephalitis, seizures, and severe behavioral abnormalities. While antibodies for several neuronal targets have been identified, structural details on how they regulate function are unknown. Here we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of antibodies derived from an encephalitis patient bound to the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor. These antibodies induced severe encephalitis by directly inhibiting GABAA function, resulting in nervous-system hyperexcitability. The structures reveal mechanisms of GABAA inhibition and pathology. One antibody directly competes with a neurotransmitter and locks the receptor in a resting-like state. The second antibody targets the subunit interface involved in binding benzodiazepines and antagonizes diazepam potentiation. We identify key residues in these antibodies involved in specificity and affinity and confirm structure-based hypotheses for functional effects using electrophysiology. Together these studies define mechanisms of direct functional antagonism of neurotransmission underlying autoimmune encephalitis in a human patient.

Abstract: Summary
Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is postulated to exert “top-down control” on information processing throughout the brain to promote specific behaviors. However, pathways mediating top-down control remain poorly understood. In particular, knowledge about direct prefrontal connections that might facilitate top-down control of hippocampal information processing remains sparse. Here we describe monosynaptic long-range GABAergic projections from PFC to hippocampus. These preferentially inhibit vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing interneurons, which are known to disinhibit hippocampal microcircuits. Indeed, stimulating prefrontal–hippocampal GABAergic projections increases hippocampal feedforward inhibition and reduces hippocampal activity in vivo. The net effect of these actions is to specifically enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for hippocampal encoding of object locations and augment object-induced increases in spatial information. Correspondingly, activating or inhibiting these projections promotes or suppresses object exploration, respectively. Together, these results elucidate a top-down prefrontal pathway in which long-range GABAergic projections target disinhibitory microcircuits, thereby enhancing signals and network dynamics underlying exploratory behavior.

Abstract: Summary
The supercoiling of bacterial and archaeal flagellar filaments is required for motility. Archaeal flagellar filaments have no homology to their bacterial counterparts and are instead homologs of bacterial type IV pili. How these prokaryotic flagellar filaments, each composed of thousands of copies of identical subunits, can form stable supercoils under torsional stress is a fascinating puzzle for which structural insights have been elusive. Advances in cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) make it now possible to directly visualize the basis for supercoiling, and here, we show the atomic structures of supercoiled bacterial and archaeal flagellar filaments. For the bacterial flagellar filament, we identify 11 distinct protofilament conformations with three broad classes of inter-protomer interface. For the archaeal flagellar filament, 10 protofilaments form a supercoil geometry supported by 10 distinct conformations, with one inter-protomer discontinuity creating a seam inside of the curve. Our results suggest that convergent evolution has yielded stable superhelical geometries that enable microbial locomotion.

Abstract: Summary
Oakleaf butterflies in the genus Kallima have a polymorphic wing phenotype, enabling these insects to masquerade as dead leaves. This iconic example of protective resemblance provides an interesting evolutionary paradigm that can be employed to study biodiversity. We integrated multi-omic data analyses and functional validation to infer the evolutionary history of Kallima species and investigate the genetic basis of their variable leaf wing patterns. We find that Kallima butterflies diversified in the eastern Himalayas and dispersed to East and Southeast Asia. Moreover, we find that leaf wing polymorphism is controlled by the wing patterning gene cortex, which has been maintained in Kallima by long-term balancing selection. Our results provide macroevolutionary and microevolutionary insights into a model species originating from a mountain ecosystem.

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 secretion systems (T1SSs) are widespread in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, extruding protein substrates following synthesis of the entire polypeptide. The Escherichia coli hemolysin A secretion system has long been considered a prototype in structural and mechanistic studies of T1SSs. Three membrane proteins—an inner membrane ABC transporter HlyB, an adaptor protein HlyD, and an outer membrane porin TolC—are required for secretion. However, the stoichiometry and structure of the complex are unknown. Here, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures determined in two conformations reveal that the inner membrane complex is a hetero-dodecameric assembly comprising three HlyB homodimers and six HlyD subunits. Functional studies indicate that oligomerization of HlyB and HlyD is essential for protein secretion and that polypeptides translocate through a canonical ABC transporter pathway in HlyB. Our data suggest that T1SSs entail three ABC transporters, one that functions as a protein channel and two that allosterically power the translocation process.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastomas are incurable tumors infiltrating the brain. A subpopulation of glioblastoma cells forms a functional and therapy-resistant tumor cell network interconnected by tumor microtubes (TMs). Other subpopulations appear unconnected, and their biological role remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that whole-brain colonization is fueled by glioblastoma cells that lack connections with other tumor cells and astrocytes yet receive synaptic input from neurons. This subpopulation corresponds to neuronal and neural-progenitor-like tumor cell states, as defined by single-cell transcriptomics, both in mouse models and in the human disease. Tumor cell invasion resembled neuronal migration mechanisms and adopted a Lévy-like movement pattern of probing the environment. Neuronal activity induced complex calcium signals in glioblastoma cells followed by the de novo formation of TMs and increased invasion speed. Collectively, superimposing molecular and functional single-cell data revealed that neuronal mechanisms govern glioblastoma cell invasion on multiple levels. This explains how glioblastoma’s dissemination and cellular heterogeneity are closely interlinked.

Abstract: Summary
Epidemiological studies reveal that marijuana increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, little is known about the mechanism. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the psychoactive component of marijuana, binds to cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1/CNR1) in the vasculature and is implicated in CVD. A UK Biobank analysis found that cannabis was an risk factor for CVD. We found that marijuana smoking activated inflammatory cytokines implicated in CVD. In silico virtual screening identified genistein, a soybean isoflavone, as a putative CB1 antagonist. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells were used to model Δ9-THC-induced inflammation and oxidative stress via NF-κB signaling. Knockdown of the CB1 receptor with siRNA, CRISPR interference, and genistein attenuated the effects of Δ9-THC. In mice, genistein blocked Δ9-THC-induced endothelial dysfunction in wire myograph, reduced atherosclerotic plaque, and had minimal penetration of the central nervous system. Genistein is a CB1 antagonist that attenuates Δ9-THC-induced atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria encode sophisticated anti-phage systems that are diverse and versatile and display high genetic mobility. How this variability and mobility occurs remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a widespread family of pathogenicity islands, the phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs), carry an impressive arsenal of defense mechanisms, which can be disseminated intra- and inter-generically by helper phages. These defense systems provide broad immunity, blocking not only phage reproduction, but also plasmid and non-cognate PICI transfer. Our results demonstrate that phages can mobilize PICI-encoded immunity systems to use them against other mobile genetic elements, which compete with the phages for the same bacterial hosts. Therefore, despite the cost, mobilization of PICIs may be beneficial for phages, PICIs, and bacteria in nature. Our results suggest that PICIs are important players controlling horizontal gene transfer and that PICIs and phages establish mutualistic interactions that drive bacterial ecology and evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Two mycobacteriophages were administered intravenously to a male with treatment-refractory Mycobacterium abscessus pulmonary infection and severe cystic fibrosis lung disease. The phages were engineered to enhance their capacity to lyse M. abscessus and were selected specifically as the most effective against the subject’s bacterial isolate. In the setting of compassionate use, the evidence of phage-induced lysis was observed using molecular and metabolic assays combined with clinical assessments. M. abscessus isolates pre and post-phage treatment demonstrated genetic stability, with a general decline in diversity and no increased resistance to phage or antibiotics. The anti-phage neutralizing antibody titers to one phage increased with time but did not prevent clinical improvement throughout the course of treatment. The subject received lung transplantation on day 379, and systematic culturing of the explanted lung did not detect M. abscessus. This study describes the course and associated markers of a successful phage treatment of M. abscessus in advanced lung disease.

Abstract: Summary
Necrosis of macrophages in the granuloma, the hallmark immunological structure of tuberculosis, is a major pathogenic event that increases host susceptibility. Through a zebrafish forward genetic screen, we identified the mTOR kinase, a master regulator of metabolism, as an early host resistance factor in tuberculosis. We found that mTOR complex 1 protects macrophages from mycobacterium-induced death by enabling infection-induced increases in mitochondrial energy metabolism fueled by glycolysis. These metabolic adaptations are required to prevent mitochondrial damage and death caused by the secreted mycobacterial virulence determinant ESAT-6. Thus, the host can effectively counter this early critical mycobacterial virulence mechanism simply by regulating energy metabolism, thereby allowing pathogen-specific immune mechanisms time to develop. Our findings may explain why Mycobacterium tuberculosis, albeit humanity’s most lethal pathogen, is successful in only a minority of infected individuals.

Abstract: Summary
After birth, the intestine undergoes major changes to shift from an immature proliferative state to a functional intestinal barrier. By combining inducible lineage tracing and transcriptomics in mouse models, we identify a prodifferentiation PDGFRαHigh intestinal stromal lineage originating from postnatal LTβR+ perivascular stromal progenitors. The genetic blockage of this lineage increased the intestinal stem cell pool while decreasing epithelial and immune maturation at weaning age, leading to reduced postnatal growth and dysregulated repair responses. Ablating PDGFRα in the LTBR stromal lineage demonstrates that PDGFRα has a major impact on the lineage fate and function, inducing a transcriptomic switch from prostemness genes, such as Rspo3 and Grem1, to prodifferentiation factors, including BMPs, retinoic acid, and laminins, and on spatial organization within the crypt-villus and repair responses. Our results show that the PDGFRα-induced transcriptomic switch in intestinal stromal cells is required in the first weeks after birth to coordinate postnatal intestinal maturation and function.

Abstract: Summary
Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the greatest known genetic risk factor for developing sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. How the interaction of APOE4 microglia with neurons differs from microglia expressing the disease-neutral APOE3 allele remains unknown. Here, we employ CRISPR-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to dissect the impact of APOE4 in neuron-microglia communication. Our results reveal that APOE4 induces a lipid-accumulated state that renders microglia weakly responsive to neuronal activity. By examining the transcriptional signatures of APOE3 versus APOE4 microglia in response to neuronal conditioned media, we established that neuronal cues differentially induce a lipogenic program in APOE4 microglia that exacerbates pro-inflammatory signals. Through decreased uptake of extracellular fatty acids and lipoproteins, we identified that APOE4 microglia disrupts the coordinated activity of neuronal ensembles. These findings suggest that abnormal neuronal network-level disturbances observed in Alzheimer’s disease patients harboring APOE4 may in part be triggered by impairment in lipid homeostasis in non-neuronal cells.

Abstract: Summary
Reprogramming of H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin is required for early development. How H3K9me3 is involved in early human development remains, however, largely unclear. Here, we resolve the temporal landscape of H3K9me3 during human preimplantation development and its regulation for diverse hominoid-specific retrotransposons. At the 8-cell stage, H3K9me3 reprogramming at hominoid-specific retrotransposons termed SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) facilitates interaction between certain promoters and SVA-derived enhancers, promoting the zygotic genome activation. In trophectoderm, de novo H3K9me3 domains prevent pluripotent transcription factors from binding to hominoid-specific retrotransposons-derived regulatory elements for inner cell mass (ICM)-specific genes. H3K9me3 re-establishment at SVA elements in the ICM is associated with higher transcription of DNA repair genes, when compared with naive human pluripotent stem cells. Our data demonstrate that species-specific reorganization of H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin at hominoid-specific retrotransposons plays important roles during early human development, shedding light on how the epigenetic regulation for early development has evolved in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Upon stress, eukaryotes typically reprogram their translatome through GCN2-mediated phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF2α, to inhibit general translation initiation while selectively translating essential stress regulators. Unexpectedly, in plants, pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and response to other environmental stresses occur independently of the GCN2/eIF2α pathway. Here, we show that while PTI induces mRNA decapping to inhibit general translation, defense mRNAs with a purine-rich element (“R-motif”) are selectively translated using R-motif as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). R-motif-dependent translation is executed by poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) through preferential association with the PTI-activating eIFiso4G over the repressive eIF4G. Phosphorylation by PTI regulators mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 and 6 (MPK3/6) inhibits eIF4G’s activity while enhancing PABP binding to the R-motif and promoting eIFiso4G-mediated defense mRNA translation, establishing a link between PTI signaling and protein synthesis. Given its prevalence in both plants and animals, the PABP/R-motif translation initiation module may have a broader role in reprogramming the stress translatome.

Abstract: Summary
The liver carries a remarkable ability to regenerate rapidly after acute zonal damage. Single-cell approaches are necessary to study this process, given the spatial heterogeneity of liver cell types. Here, we use spatially resolved single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study the dynamics of mouse liver regeneration after acute acetaminophen (APAP) intoxication. We find that hepatocytes proliferate throughout the liver lobule, creating the mitotic pressure required to repopulate the necrotic pericentral zone rapidly. A subset of hepatocytes located at the regenerating front transiently upregulate fetal-specific genes, including Afp and Cdh17, as they reprogram to a pericentral state. Zonated endothelial, hepatic stellate cell (HSC), and macrophage populations are differentially involved in immune recruitment, proliferation, and matrix remodeling. We observe massive transient infiltration of myeloid cells, yet stability of lymphoid cell abundance, in accordance with a global decline in antigen presentation. Our study provides a resource for understanding the coordinated programs of zonal liver regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Human gut commensals are increasingly suggested to impact non-communicable diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), yet their targeted suppression remains a daunting unmet challenge. In four geographically distinct IBD cohorts (n = 537), we identify a clade of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) strains, featuring a unique antibiotics resistance and mobilome signature, to be strongly associated with disease exacerbation and severity. Transfer of clinical IBD-associated Kp strains into colitis-prone, germ-free, and colonized mice enhances intestinal inflammation. Stepwise generation of a lytic five-phage combination, targeting sensitive and resistant IBD-associated Kp clade members through distinct mechanisms, enables effective Kp suppression in colitis-prone mice, driving an attenuated inflammation and disease severity. Proof-of-concept assessment of Kp-targeting phages in an artificial human gut and in healthy volunteers demonstrates gastric acid-dependent phage resilience, safety, and viability in the lower gut. Collectively, we demonstrate the feasibility of orally administered combination phage therapy in avoiding resistance, while effectively inhibiting non-communicable disease-contributing pathobionts.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical synapses between axons and dendrites mediate neuronal intercellular communication. Here, we describe a synapse between axons and primary cilia: the axo-ciliary synapse. Using enhanced focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy on samples with optimally preserved ultrastructure, we discovered synapses between brainstem serotonergic axons and the primary cilia of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Functionally, these cilia are enriched in a ciliary-restricted serotonin receptor, the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6 (5-HTR6). Using a cilia-targeted serotonin sensor, we show that opto- and chemogenetic stimulation of serotonergic axons releases serotonin onto cilia. Ciliary 5-HTR6 stimulation activates a non-canonical Gαq/11-RhoA pathway, which modulates nuclear actin and increases histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility. Ablation of this pathway reduces chromatin accessibility in CA1 pyramidal neurons. As a signaling apparatus with proximity to the nucleus, axo-ciliary synapses short circuit neurotransmission to alter the postsynaptic neuron’s epigenetic state.

Abstract: Summary
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are a persistent human foe, transmitting arboviruses including dengue when they feed on human blood. Mosquitoes are intensely attracted to body odor and carbon dioxide, which they detect using ionotropic chemosensory receptors encoded by three large multi-gene families. Genetic mutations that disrupt the olfactory system have modest effects on human attraction, suggesting redundancy in odor coding. The canonical view is that olfactory sensory neurons each express a single chemosensory receptor that defines its ligand selectivity. We discovered that Ae. aegypti uses a different organizational principle, with many neurons co-expressing multiple chemosensory receptor genes. In vivo electrophysiology demonstrates that the broad ligand-sensitivity of mosquito olfactory neurons depends on this non-canonical co-expression. The redundancy afforded by an olfactory system in which neurons co-express multiple chemosensory receptors may increase the robustness of the mosquito olfactory system and explain our long-standing inability to disrupt the detection of humans by mosquitoes.

Abstract: Summary
COVID survivors frequently experience lingering neurological symptoms that resemble cancer-therapy-related cognitive impairment, a syndrome for which white matter microglial reactivity and consequent neural dysregulation is central. Here, we explored the neurobiological effects of respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection and found white-matter-selective microglial reactivity in mice and humans. Following mild respiratory COVID in mice, persistently impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, decreased oligodendrocytes, and myelin loss were evident together with elevated CSF cytokines/chemokines including CCL11. Systemic CCL11 administration specifically caused hippocampal microglial reactivity and impaired neurogenesis. Concordantly, humans with lasting cognitive symptoms post-COVID exhibit elevated CCL11 levels. Compared with SARS-CoV-2, mild respiratory influenza in mice caused similar patterns of white-matter-selective microglial reactivity, oligodendrocyte loss, impaired neurogenesis, and elevated CCL11 at early time points, but after influenza, only elevated CCL11 and hippocampal pathology persisted. These findings illustrate similar neuropathophysiology after cancer therapy and respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection which may contribute to cognitive impairment following even mild COVID.

Abstract: Summary
For many solid malignancies, lymph node (LN) involvement represents a harbinger of distant metastatic disease and, therefore, an important prognostic factor. Beyond its utility as a biomarker, whether and how LN metastasis plays an active role in shaping distant metastasis remains an open question. Here, we develop a syngeneic melanoma mouse model of LN metastasis to investigate how tumors spread to LNs and whether LN colonization influences metastasis to distant tissues. We show that an epigenetically instilled tumor-intrinsic interferon response program confers enhanced LN metastatic potential by enabling the evasion of NK cells and promoting LN colonization. LN metastases resist T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, induce antigen-specific regulatory T cells, and generate tumor-specific immune tolerance that subsequently facilitates distant tumor colonization. These effects extend to human cancers and other murine cancer models, implicating a conserved systemic mechanism by which malignancies spread to distant organs.

Abstract: Summary
Many tissues harbor quiescent stem cells that are activated upon injury, subsequently proliferating and differentiating to repair tissue damage. Mechanisms by which stem cells sense injury and transition from quiescence to activation, however, remain largely unknown. Resident skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are essential orchestrators of muscle regeneration and repair. Here, with a combination of in vivo and ex vivo approaches, we show that quiescent MuSCs have elaborate, Rac GTPase-promoted cytoplasmic projections that respond to injury via the upregulation of Rho/ROCK signaling, facilitating projection retraction and driving downstream activation events. These early events involve rapid cytoskeletal rearrangements and occur independently of exogenous growth factors. This mechanism is conserved across a broad range of MuSC activation models, including injury, disease, and genetic loss of quiescence. Our results redefine MuSC activation and present a central mechanism by which quiescent stem cells initiate responses to injury.

Abstract: Summary
The factors driving therapy resistance in diffuse glioma remain poorly understood. To identify treatment-associated cellular and genetic changes, we analyzed RNA and/or DNA sequencing data from the temporally separated tumor pairs of 304 adult patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wild-type and IDH-mutant glioma. Tumors recurred in distinct manners that were dependent on IDH mutation status and attributable to changes in histological feature composition, somatic alterations, and microenvironment interactions. Hypermutation and acquired CDKN2A deletions were associated with an increase in proliferating neoplastic cells at recurrence in both glioma subtypes, reflecting active tumor growth. IDH-wild-type tumors were more invasive at recurrence, and their neoplastic cells exhibited increased expression of neuronal signaling programs that reflected a possible role for neuronal interactions in promoting glioma progression. Mesenchymal transition was associated with the presence of a myeloid cell state defined by specific ligand-receptor interactions with neoplastic cells. Collectively, these recurrence-associated phenotypes represent potential targets to alter disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Genetically encoded voltage indicators are emerging tools for monitoring voltage dynamics with cell-type specificity. However, current indicators enable a narrow range of applications due to poor performance under two-photon microscopy, a method of choice for deep-tissue recording. To improve indicators, we developed a multiparameter high-throughput platform to optimize voltage indicators for two-photon microscopy. Using this system, we identified JEDI-2P, an indicator that is faster, brighter, and more sensitive and photostable than its predecessors. We demonstrate that JEDI-2P can report light-evoked responses in axonal termini of Drosophila interneurons and the dendrites and somata of amacrine cells of isolated mouse retina. JEDI-2P can also optically record the voltage dynamics of individual cortical neurons in awake behaving mice for more than 30 min using both resonant-scanning and ULoVE random-access microscopy. Finally, ULoVE recording of JEDI-2P can robustly detect spikes at depths exceeding 400 μm and report voltage correlations in pairs of neurons.

Abstract: Summary
During vertebrate embryogenesis, cell collectives engage in coordinated behavior to form tissue structures of increasing complexity. In the avian skin, assembly into follicles depends on intrinsic mechanical forces of the dermis, but how cell mechanics initiate pattern formation is not known. Here, we reconstitute the initiation of follicle patterning ex vivo using only freshly dissociated avian dermal cells and collagen. We find that contractile cells physically rearrange the extracellular matrix (ECM) and that ECM rearrangement further aligns cells. This exchange transforms a mechanically unlinked collective of dermal cells into a continuum, with coherent, long-range order. Combining theory with experiment, we show that this ordered cell-ECM layer behaves as an active contractile fluid that spontaneously forms regular patterns. Our study illustrates a role for mesenchymal dynamics in generating cell-level ordering and tissue-level patterning through a fluid instability—processes that may be at play across morphological symmetry-breaking contexts.

GLP-1 exerts anorectic and antimotility actions that protect the body against nutrient malabsorption. However, little is known about how intestinal GLP-1 affects distant organs despite rapid enzymatic inactivation. We show that intestinal GLP-1 inhibits gastric emptying and eating via intestinofugal neurons, a subclass of myenteric neurons that project to abdominal sympathetic ganglia. Remarkably, cell-specific ablation of intestinofugal neurons eliminated intestinal GLP-1 effects, and their chemical activation functioned as a GLP-1 mimetic. GLP-1 sensing by intestinofugal neurons then engaged a sympatho-gastro-spinal-reticular-hypothalamic pathway that links abnormal stomach distension to craniofacial programs for food rejection. Within this pathway, cell-specific activation of discrete neuronal populations caused systemic GLP-1-like effects. These molecularly identified, delimited enteric circuits may be targeted to ameliorate the abdominal bloating and loss of appetite typical of gastric motility disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem-cell-derived organoids are models for human development and disease. We report a modified human kidney organoid system that generates thousands of similar organoids, each consisting of 1–2 nephron-like structures. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling and immunofluorescence validation highlighted patterned nephron-like structures utilizing similar pathways, with distinct morphogenesis, to human nephrogenesis. To examine this platform for therapeutic screening, the polycystic kidney disease genes PKD1 and PKD2 were inactivated by gene editing. PKD1 and PKD2 mutant models exhibited efficient and reproducible cyst formation. Cystic outgrowths could be propagated for months to centimeter-sized cysts. To shed new light on cystogenesis, 247 protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) were screened in a live imaging assay identifying compounds blocking cyst formation but not overall organoid growth. Scaling and further development of the organoid platform will enable a broader capability for kidney disease modeling and high-throughput drug screens.

Abstract: Summary
The continual evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the emergence of variants that show resistance to vaccines and neutralizing antibodies threaten to prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. Selection and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants are driven in part by mutations within the viral spike protein and in particular the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), a primary target site for neutralizing antibodies. Here, we develop deep mutational learning (DML), a machine-learning-guided protein engineering technology, which is used to investigate a massive sequence space of combinatorial mutations, representing billions of RBD variants, by accurately predicting their impact on ACE2 binding and antibody escape. A highly diverse landscape of possible SARS-CoV-2 variants is identified that could emerge from a multitude of evolutionary trajectories. DML may be used for predictive profiling on current and prospective variants, including highly mutated variants such as Omicron, thus guiding the development of therapeutic antibody treatments and vaccines for COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
Human cleavage-stage embryos frequently acquire chromosomal aneuploidies during mitosis due to unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that S phase at the 1-cell stage shows replication fork stalling, low fork speed, and DNA synthesis extending into G2 phase. DNA damage foci consistent with collapsed replication forks, DSBs, and incomplete replication form in G2 in an ATR- and MRE11-dependent manner, followed by spontaneous chromosome breakage and segmental aneuploidies. Entry into mitosis with incomplete replication results in chromosome breakage, whole and segmental chromosome errors, micronucleation, chromosome fragmentation, and poor embryo quality. Sites of spontaneous chromosome breakage are concordant with sites of DNA synthesis in G2 phase, locating to gene-poor regions with long neural genes, which are transcriptionally silent at this stage of development. Thus, DNA replication stress in mammalian preimplantation embryos predisposes gene-poor regions to fragility, and in particular in the human embryo, to the formation of aneuploidies, impairing developmental potential.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell research endeavors to generate specific subtypes of classically defined “cell types.” Here, we generate >90% pure human artery or vein endothelial cells from pluripotent stem cells within 3–4 days. We specified artery cells by inhibiting vein-specifying signals and vice versa. These cells modeled viral infection of human vasculature by Nipah and Hendra viruses, which are extraordinarily deadly (∼57%–59% fatality rate) and require biosafety-level-4 containment. Generating pure populations of artery and vein cells highlighted that Nipah and Hendra viruses preferentially infected arteries; arteries expressed higher levels of their viral-entry receptor. Virally infected artery cells fused into syncytia containing up to 23 nuclei, which rapidly died. Despite infecting arteries and occupying ∼6%–17% of their transcriptome, Nipah and Hendra largely eluded innate immune detection, minimally eliciting interferon signaling. We thus efficiently generate artery and vein cells, introduce stem-cell-based toolkits for biosafety-level-4 virology, and explore the arterial tropism and cellular effects of Nipah and Hendra viruses.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are responsible for the production of blood and immune cells. Throughout life, HSPCs acquire oncogenic aberrations that can cause hematological cancers. Although molecular programs maintaining stem cell integrity have been identified, safety mechanisms eliminating malignant HSPCs from the stem cell pool remain poorly characterized. Here, we show that HSPCs constitutively present antigens via major histocompatibility complex class II. The presentation of immunogenic antigens, as occurring during malignant transformation, triggers bidirectional interactions between HSPCs and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, causing stem cell proliferation, differentiation, and specific exhaustion of aberrant HSPCs. This immunosurveillance mechanism effectively eliminates transformed HSPCs from the hematopoietic system, thereby preventing leukemia onset. Together, our data reveal a bidirectional interaction between HSPCs and CD4+ T cells, demonstrating that HSPCs are not only passive receivers of immunological signals but also actively engage in adaptive immune responses to safeguard the integrity of the stem cell pool.

Abstract: Summary
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is an important evolutionary force shaping prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. HGT-acquired genes have been sporadically reported in insects, a lineage containing >50% of animals. We systematically examined HGT in 218 high-quality genomes of diverse insects and found that they acquired 1,410 genes exhibiting diverse functions, including many not previously reported, via 741 distinct transfers from non-metazoan donors. Lepidopterans had the highest average number of HGT-acquired genes. HGT-acquired genes containing introns exhibited substantially higher expression levels than genes lacking introns, suggesting that intron gains were likely involved in HGT adaptation. Lastly, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to edit the prevalent unreported gene LOC105383139, which was transferred into the last common ancestor of moths and butterflies. In diamondback moths, males lacking LOC105383139 courted females significantly less. We conclude that HGT has been a major contributor to insect adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
Highly transmissible Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 currently dominate globally. Here, we compare neutralization of Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2. BA.2 RBD has slightly higher ACE2 affinity than BA.1 and slightly reduced neutralization by vaccine serum, possibly associated with its increased transmissibility. Neutralization differences between sub-lineages for mAbs (including therapeutics) mostly arise from variation in residues bordering the ACE2 binding site; however, more distant mutations S371F (BA.2) and R346K (BA.1.1) markedly reduce neutralization by therapeutic antibody Vir-S309. In-depth structure-and-function analyses of 27 potent RBD-binding mAbs isolated from vaccinated volunteers following breakthrough Omicron-BA.1 infection reveals that they are focused in two main clusters within the RBD, with potent right-shoulder antibodies showing increased prevalence. Selection and somatic maturation have optimized antibody potency in less-mutated epitopes and recovered potency in highly mutated epitopes. All 27 mAbs potently neutralize early pandemic strains, and many show broad reactivity with variants of concern.

Abstract: Summary
Drug-tolerant persister cells (persisters) evade apoptosis upon targeted and conventional cancer therapies and represent a major non-genetic barrier to effective cancer treatment. Here, we show that cells that survive treatment with pro-apoptotic BH3 mimetics display a persister phenotype that includes colonization and metastasis in vivo and increased sensitivity toward ferroptosis by GPX4 inhibition. We found that sublethal mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and holocytochrome c release are key requirements for the generation of the persister phenotype. The generation of persisters is independent of apoptosome formation and caspase activation, but instead, cytosolic cytochrome c induces the activation of heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase and engagement of the integrated stress response (ISR) with the consequent synthesis of ATF4, all of which are required for the persister phenotype. Our results reveal that sublethal cytochrome c release couples sublethal MOMP to caspase-independent initiation of an ATF4-dependent, drug-tolerant persister phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) frequently occurs in patients with advanced melanoma; yet, our understanding of the underlying salient biology is rudimentary. Here, we performed single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq in 22 treatment-naive MBMs and 10 extracranial melanoma metastases (ECMs) and matched spatial single-cell transcriptomics and T cell receptor (TCR)-seq. Cancer cells from MBMs were more chromosomally unstable, adopted a neuronal-like cell state, and enriched for spatially variably expressed metabolic pathways. Key observations were validated in independent patient cohorts, patient-derived MBM/ECM xenograft models, RNA/ATAC-seq, proteomics, and multiplexed imaging. Integrated spatial analyses revealed distinct geography of putative cancer immune evasion and evidence for more abundant intra-tumoral B to plasma cell differentiation in lymphoid aggregates in MBM. MBM harbored larger fractions of monocyte-derived macrophages and dysfunctional TOX+CD8+ T cells with distinct expression of immune checkpoints. This work provides comprehensive insights into MBM biology and serves as a foundational resource for further discovery and therapeutic exploration.

Abstract: Summary
Rare copy-number variants (rCNVs) include deletions and duplications that occur infrequently in the global human population and can confer substantial risk for disease. In this study, we aimed to quantify the properties of haploinsufficiency (i.e., deletion intolerance) and triplosensitivity (i.e., duplication intolerance) throughout the human genome. We harmonized and meta-analyzed rCNVs from nearly one million individuals to construct a genome-wide catalog of dosage sensitivity across 54 disorders, which defined 163 dosage sensitive segments associated with at least one disorder. These segments were typically gene dense and often harbored dominant dosage sensitive driver genes, which we were able to prioritize using statistical fine-mapping. Finally, we designed an ensemble machine-learning model to predict probabilities of dosage sensitivity (pHaplo & pTriplo) for all autosomal genes, which identified 2,987 haploinsufficient and 1,559 triplosensitive genes, including 648 that were uniquely triplosensitive. This dosage sensitivity resource will provide broad utility for human disease research and clinical genetics.

Abstract: Summary
The extracellular pH is a vital regulator of various biological processes in plants. However, how plants perceive extracellular pH remains obscure. Here, we report that plant cell-surface peptide-receptor complexes can function as extracellular pH sensors. We found that pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) dramatically alkalinizes the acidic extracellular pH in root apical meristem (RAM) region, which is essential for root meristem growth factor 1 (RGF1)-mediated RAM growth. The extracellular alkalinization progressively inhibits the acidic-dependent interaction between RGF1 and its receptors (RGFRs) through the pH sensor sulfotyrosine. Conversely, extracellular alkalinization promotes the alkaline-dependent binding of plant elicitor peptides (Peps) to its receptors (PEPRs) through the pH sensor Glu/Asp, thereby promoting immunity. A domain swap between RGFR and PEPR switches the pH dependency of RAM growth. Thus, our results reveal a mechanism of extracellular pH sensing by plant peptide-receptor complexes and provide insights into the extracellular pH-mediated regulation of growth and immunity in the RAM.

Abstract: Summary
Plant fibers in byproduct streams produced by non-harsh food processing methods represent biorepositories of diverse, naturally occurring, and physiologically active biomolecules. To demonstrate one approach for their characterization, mass spectrometry of intestinal contents from gnotobiotic mice, plus in vitro studies, revealed liberation of N-methylserotonin from orange fibers by human gut microbiota members including Bacteroides ovatus. Functional genomic analyses of B. ovatus strains grown under permissive and non-permissive N-methylserotonin “mining” conditions revealed polysaccharide utilization loci that target pectins whose expression correlate with strain-specific liberation of this compound. N-methylserotonin, orally administered to germ-free mice, reduced adiposity, altered liver glycogenesis, shortened gut transit time, and changed expression of genes that regulate circadian rhythm in the liver and colon. In human studies, dose-dependent, orange-fiber-specific fecal accumulation of N-methylserotonin positively correlated with levels of microbiome genes encoding enzymes that digest pectic glycans. Identifying this type of microbial mining activity has potential therapeutic implications.

Abstract: Summary
The mitochondrial genome encodes 13 components of the oxidative phosphorylation system, and altered mitochondrial transcription drives various human pathologies. A polyadenylated, non-coding RNA molecule known as 7S RNA is transcribed from a region immediately downstream of the light strand promoter in mammalian cells, and its levels change rapidly in response to physiological conditions. Here, we report that 7S RNA has a regulatory function, as it controls levels of mitochondrial transcription both in vitro and in cultured human cells. Using cryo-EM, we show that POLRMT dimerization is induced by interactions with 7S RNA. The resulting POLRMT dimer interface sequesters domains necessary for promoter recognition and unwinding, thereby preventing transcription initiation. We propose that the non-coding 7S RNA molecule is a component of a negative feedback loop that regulates mitochondrial transcription in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) adapt their metabolism to maintenance and proliferation; however, the mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrated that homeostatic HSCs exhibited high amino acid (AA) catabolism to reduce cellular AA levels, which activated the GCN2-eIF2α axis, a protein synthesis inhibitory checkpoint to restrain protein synthesis for maintenance. Furthermore, upon proliferation conditions, HSCs enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for higher energy production but decreased AA catabolism to accumulate cellular AAs, which inactivated the GCN2-eIF2α axis to increase protein synthesis and coupled with proteotoxic stress. Importantly, GCN2 deletion impaired HSC function in repopulation and regeneration. Mechanistically, GCN2 maintained proteostasis and inhibited Src-mediated AKT activation to repress mitochondrial OXPHOS in HSCs. Moreover, the glycolytic metabolite, NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR), accelerated AA catabolism to activate GCN2 and sustain the long-term function of HSCs. Overall, our study uncovered direct links between metabolic alterations and translation control in HSCs during homeostasis and proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
The embryo instructs the allocation of cell states to spatially regulate functions. In the blastocyst, patterning of trophoblast (TR) cells ensures successful implantation and placental development. Here, we defined an optimal set of molecules secreted by the epiblast (inducers) that captures in vitro stable, highly self-renewing mouse trophectoderm stem cells (TESCs) resembling the blastocyst stage. When exposed to suboptimal inducers, these stem cells fluctuate to form interconvertible subpopulations with reduced self-renewal and facilitated differentiation, resembling peri-implantation cells, known as TR stem cells (TSCs). TESCs have enhanced capacity to form blastoids that implant more efficiently in utero due to inducers maintaining not only local TR proliferation and self-renewal, but also WNT6/7B secretion that stimulates uterine decidualization. Overall, the epiblast maintains sustained growth and decidualization potential of abutting TR cells, while, as known, distancing imposed by the blastocyst cavity differentiates TR cells for uterus adhesion, thus patterning the essential functions of implantation.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro cultured stem cells with distinct developmental capacities can contribute to embryonic or extraembryonic tissues after microinjection into pre-implantation mammalian embryos. However, whether cultured stem cells can independently give rise to entire gastrulating embryo-like structures with embryonic and extraembryonic compartments remains unknown. Here, we adapt a recently established platform for prolonged ex utero growth of natural embryos to generate mouse post-gastrulation synthetic whole embryo models (sEmbryos), with both embryonic and extraembryonic compartments, starting solely from naive ESCs. This was achieved by co-aggregating non-transduced ESCs, with naive ESCs transiently expressing Cdx2 or Gata4 to promote their priming toward trophectoderm and primitive endoderm lineages, respectively. sEmbryos adequately accomplish gastrulation, advance through key developmental milestones, and develop organ progenitors within complex extraembryonic compartments similar to E8.5 stage mouse embryos. Our findings highlight the plastic potential of naive pluripotent cells to self-organize and functionally reconstitute and model the entire mammalian embryo beyond gastrulation.

Abstract: Summary
A central goal of genetics is to define the relationships between genotypes and phenotypes. High-content phenotypic screens such as Perturb-seq (CRISPR-based screens with single-cell RNA-sequencing readouts) enable massively parallel functional genomic mapping but, to date, have been used at limited scales. Here, we perform genome-scale Perturb-seq targeting all expressed genes with CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) across >2.5 million human cells. We use transcriptional phenotypes to predict the function of poorly characterized genes, uncovering new regulators of ribosome biogenesis (including CCDC86, ZNF236, and SPATA5L1), transcription (C7orf26), and mitochondrial respiration (TMEM242). In addition to assigning gene function, single-cell transcriptional phenotypes allow for in-depth dissection of complex cellular phenomena—from RNA processing to differentiation. We leverage this ability to systematically identify genetic drivers and consequences of aneuploidy and to discover an unanticipated layer of stress-specific regulation of the mitochondrial genome. Our information-rich genotype-phenotype map reveals a multidimensional portrait of gene and cellular function.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we report inducible mosaic animal for perturbation (iMAP), a transgenic platform enabling in situ CRISPR targeting of at least 100 genes in parallel throughout the mouse body. iMAP combines Cre-loxP and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies and utilizes a germline-transmitted transgene carrying a large array of individually floxed, tandemly linked gRNA-coding units. Cre-mediated recombination triggers expression of all the gRNAs in the array but only one of them per cell, converting the mice to mosaic organisms suitable for phenotypic characterization and also for high-throughput derivation of conventional single-gene perturbation lines via breeding. Using gRNA representation as a readout, we mapped a miniature Perturb-Atlas cataloging the perturbations of 90 genes across 39 tissues, which yields rich insights into context-dependent gene functions and provides a glimpse of the potential of iMAP in genome decoding.

Abstract: Summary
Neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade has shown promising clinical activity. Here, we characterized early kinetics in tumor-infiltrating and circulating immune cells in oral cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 in a clinical trial (NCT02919683). Tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells that clonally expanded during immunotherapy expressed elevated tissue-resident memory and cytotoxicity programs, which were already active prior to therapy, supporting the capacity for rapid response. Systematic target discovery revealed that treatment-expanded tumor T cell clones in responding patients recognized several self-antigens, including the cancer-specific antigen MAGEA1. Treatment also induced a systemic immune response characterized by expansion of activated T cells enriched for tumor-infiltrating T cell clonotypes, including both pre-existing and emergent clonotypes undetectable prior to therapy. The frequency of activated blood CD8 T cells, notably pre-treatment PD-1-positive KLRG1-negative T cells, was strongly associated with intra-tumoral pathological response. These results demonstrate how neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade induces local and systemic tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The T cell receptor (TCR) expressed by T lymphocytes initiates protective immune responses to pathogens and tumors. To explore the structural basis of how TCR signaling is initiated when the receptor binds to peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules, we used cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of a tumor-reactive TCRαβ/CD3δγε2ζ2 complex bound to a melanoma-specific human class I pMHC at 3.08 Å resolution. The antigen-bound complex comprises 11 subunits stabilized by multivalent interactions across three structural layers, with clustered membrane-proximal cystines stabilizing the CD3-εδ and CD3-εγ heterodimers. Extra density sandwiched between transmembrane helices reveals the involvement of sterol lipids in TCR assembly. The geometry of the pMHC/TCR complex suggests that efficient TCR scanning of pMHC requires accurate pre-positioning of T cell and antigen-presenting cell membranes. Comparisons of the ligand-bound and unliganded receptors, along with molecular dynamics simulations, indicate that TCRs can be triggered in the absence of spontaneous structural rearrangements.

Abstract: Summary
Tau is a microtubule-binding protein expressed in neurons, and the equal ratios between 4-repeat (4R) and 3-repeat (3R) isoforms are maintained in normal adult brain function. Dysregulation of 3R:4R ratio causes tauopathy, and human neurons that recapitulate tau isoforms in health and disease will provide a platform for elucidating pathogenic processes involving tau pathology. We carried out extensive characterizations of tau isoforms expressed in human neurons derived by microRNA-induced neuronal reprogramming of adult fibroblasts. Transcript and protein analyses showed that miR neurons expressed all six isoforms with the 3R:4R isoform ratio equivalent to that detected in human adult brains. Also, miR neurons derived from familial tauopathy patients with a 3R:4R ratio altering mutation showed increased 4R tau and the formation of insoluble tau with seeding activity. Our results collectively demonstrate the utility of miRNA-induced neuronal reprogramming to recapitulate endogenous tau regulation comparable with the adult brain in health and disease.
