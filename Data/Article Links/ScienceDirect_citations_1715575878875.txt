Abstract: Summary
Elicitation of HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) is challenging because unmutated bnAb precursors are rare and seldom bind HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers. One strategy to initiate bnAb responses is to use germline-targeting (GT) immunogens with high affinity to bnAb-class precursor B cells and then shepherd affinity maturation with booster immunogens that successively look more like native Env. In a mouse model where the frequency of VRC01-precursor (VRC01gHL) B cells mimics that of humans, we show that following a GT HIV Env trimer protein prime, VRC01-class B cells in the germinal center (GC) acquire high-affinity VRC01-class B cell somatic hypermutations (SHMs). Many GC-derived VRC01gHL antibodies robustly bind N276 glycan-deficient Env trimers and neutralize several N276 glycan-deficient tier 2 HIV strains. These results are encouraging for GT Env trimer vaccine designs and demonstrate accumulation of substantial SHMs, including deletions, uncommon point mutations, and functional bnAb features, after a single immunization.

Abstract: Summary
The reverse cholesterol transport pathway is responsible for the maintenance of human cholesterol homeostasis, an imbalance of which usually leads to atherosclerosis. As a key component of this pathway, the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG1 forwards cellular cholesterol to the extracellular acceptor nascent high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Here, we report a 3.26-Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of cholesterol-bound ABCG1 in an inward-facing conformation, which represents a turnover condition upon ATP binding. Structural analyses combined with functional assays reveals that a cluster of conserved hydrophobic residues, in addition to two sphingomyelins, constitute a well-defined cholesterol-binding cavity. The exit of this cavity is closed by three pairs of conserved Phe residues, which constitute a hydrophobic path for the release of cholesterol in an acceptor concentration-dependent manner. Overall, we propose an ABCG1-driven cholesterol transport cycle initiated by sphingomyelin-assisted cholesterol recruitment and accomplished by the release of cholesterol to HDL.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic homeostasis is under circadian regulation to adapt energy requirements to light-dark cycles. Feeding cycles are regulated by photic stimuli reaching the suprachiasmatic nucleus via retinohypothalamic axons and by nutritional information involving dopaminergic neurotransmission. Previously, we reported that Pitx3-mutant Aphakia mice with altered development of the retinohypothalamic tract and the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the striatum, are resistant to locomotor and metabolic entrainment by time-restricted feeding. In their Matters Arising article, Scarpa et al. (2022) challenge this conclusion using mice from the same strain but following a different experimental paradigm involving calorie restriction. Here, we address their concerns by extending the analyses of our previous data, by identifying important differences in the experimental design between both studies and by presenting additional results on the dopaminergic deficit in the brain of Aphakia mice. This Matters Arising Response article addresses the Matters Arising article by Scarpa et al. (2022), published concurrently in Cell Reports.

Abstract: Summary
A fundamental question in biology is how embryonic development is timed between different species. To address this problem, we compared wing development in the quail and the larger chick. We reveal that pattern formation is faster in the quail as determined by the earlier activation of 5′Hox genes, termination of developmental organizers (Shh and Fgf8), and the laying down of the skeleton (Sox9). Using interspecies tissue grafts, we show that developmental timing can be reset during a critical window of retinoic acid signaling. Accordingly, extending the duration of retinoic acid signaling switches developmental timing between the quail and the chick and the chick and the larger turkey. However, the incremental growth rate is comparable between all three species, suggesting that the pace of development primarily governs differences in the expansion of the skeletal pattern. The widespread distribution of retinoic acid could coordinate developmental timing throughout the embryo.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are known as the powerhouse of the cell. Dysfunction of mitochondria homeostasis induces the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), altering cellular metabolism. How cells sense the UPRmt to rewire metabolism is largely unknown. Here, we show that inactivation of either the citric/tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes aco-2 or idha-1, which encode aconitase and isocitrate dehydrogenase respectively, leads to citrate accumulation. In Caenorhabditis elegans, both in vitro and in vivo, citrate accumulation consequently triggers the UPRmt and also promotes lipid accumulation. The transcription factor DVE-1 binds to the promoter of the nuclear hormone receptor nhr-80 to transactivate its expression. NHR-80 then upregulates lipogenesis and lipid accumulation, shifting excess citrate for use in lipogenesis and for storage as triacylglycerol in lipid droplets. Inactivation of DVE-1 or NHR-80 fully abolishes the citrate-induced lipid accumulation. Therefore, our work uncovers a DVE-1-NHR-80-lipogenesis axis linking the transmission of the mitochondrial stress signal to lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial chromatin organization is crucial for transcriptional regulation and might be particularly important in neurons since they dramatically change their transcriptome in response to external stimuli. We show that stimulation of neurons causes condensation of large chromatin domains. This phenomenon can be observed in vitro in cultured rat hippocampal neurons as well as in vivo in the amygdala and hippocampal neurons. Activity-induced chromatin condensation is an active, rapid, energy-dependent, and reversible process. It involves calcium-dependent pathways but is independent of active transcription. It is accompanied by the redistribution of posttranslational histone modifications and rearrangements in the spatial organization of chromosome territories. Moreover, it leads to the reorganization of nuclear speckles and active domains located in their proximity. Finally, we find that the histone deacetylase HDAC1 is the key regulator of this process. Our results suggest that HDAC1-dependent chromatin reorganization constitutes an important level of transcriptional regulation in neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic plasticity is long-lasting changes in synaptic currents and structure. When neurons are exposed to signals that induce aberrant neuronal excitation, they increase the threshold for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), known as metaplasticity. However, the metaplastic regulation of structural LTP (sLTP) remains unclear. We investigate glutamate uncaging/photoactivatable (pa)CaMKII-dependent sLTP induction in hippocampal CA1 neurons after chronic neuronal excitation by GABAA receptor antagonists. We find that the neuronal excitation decreases the glutamate uncaging-evoked Ca2+ influx mediated by GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors and suppresses sLTP induction. In addition, single-spine optogenetic stimulation using paCaMKII indicates the suppression of CaMKII signaling. While the inhibition of Ca2+ influx is protein synthesis independent, the paCaMKII-induced sLTP suppression depends on it. Our findings demonstrate that chronic neuronal excitation suppresses sLTP in two independent ways (i.e., dual inhibition of Ca2+ influx and CaMKII signaling). This dual inhibition mechanism may contribute to robust neuronal protection in excitable environments.

Abstract: Summary
Along with functionally intact insulin, diabetes-associated insulin peptides are secreted by β cells. By screening the expression and functional characterization of olfactory receptors (ORs) in pancreatic islets, we identified Olfr109 as the receptor that detects insulin peptides. The engagement of one insulin peptide, insB:9-23, with Olfr109 diminished insulin secretion through Gi-cAMP signaling and promoted islet-resident macrophage proliferation through a β cell-macrophage circuit and a β-arrestin-1-mediated CCL2 pathway, as evidenced by β-arrestin-1−/− mouse models. Systemic Olfr109 deficiency or deficiency induced by Pdx1-Cre+/− Olfr109fl/fl specifically alleviated intra-islet inflammatory responses and improved glucose homeostasis in Akita- and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. We further determined the binding mode between insB:9-23 and Olfr109. A pepducin-based Olfr109 antagonist improved glucose homeostasis in diabetic and obese mouse models. Collectively, we found that pancreatic β cells use Olfr109 to autonomously detect self-secreted insulin peptides, and this detection arrests insulin secretion and crosstalks with macrophages to increase intra-islet inflammation.

Abstract: The transition of stem cells from quiescence to proliferation enables tissues to self-repair. The signaling mechanisms driving these stem-cell-status decisions are still unclear. Ca2+ and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2) are two signaling pathways that have the potential to coordinate multiple signals to promote a specific cellular response. They both play important roles during nervous system development but their roles during spinal cord and muscle regeneration are not fully deciphered. Here we show in Xenopus laevis larvae that both Ca2+ and Erk1/2 signaling pathways are activated after tail amputation. In response to injury, we find that Erk1/2 signaling is activated in neural and muscle stem cells and is necessary for spinal cord and skeletal muscle regeneration. Finally, we show in vivo that Erk1/2 activity is necessary for an injury-induced increase in intracellular store-dependent Ca2+ dynamics in skeletal muscle-associated tissues but that in spinal cord, injury increases Ca2+ influx-dependent Ca2+ activity independent of Erk1/2 signaling. This study suggests that precise temporal and tissue-specific activation of Ca2+ and Erk1/2 pathways is essential for regulating spinal cord and muscle regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Upon implantation, mammalian embryos undergo major morphogenesis and key developmental processes such as body axis specification and gastrulation. However, limited accessibility obscures the study of these crucial processes. Here, we develop an ex vivo Matrigel-collagen-based culture to recapitulate mouse development from E4.5 to E6.0. Our system not only recapitulates embryonic growth, axis initiation, and overall 3D architecture in 49% of the cases, but its compatibility with light-sheet microscopy also enables the study of cellular dynamics through automatic cell segmentation. We find that, upon implantation, release of the increasing tension in the polar trophectoderm is necessary for its constriction and invagination. The resulting extra-embryonic ectoderm plays a key role in growth, morphogenesis, and patterning of the neighboring epiblast, which subsequently gives rise to all embryonic tissues. This 3D ex vivo system thus offers unprecedented access to peri-implantation development for in toto monitoring, measurement, and spatiotemporally controlled perturbation, revealing a mechano-chemical interplay between extra-embryonic and embryonic tissues.

Abstract: The anti-oxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is known to exert anti-inflammatory effects. From a library of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines, we identified a novel compound KKC080096 that upregulated HO-1 at the mRNA and protein levels in microglial BV-2 cells. KKC080096 exhibited anti-inflammatory effects via suppressing nitric oxide, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and iNOS production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged cells. It inhibited the phosphorylation of IKK and MAP kinases (p38, JNK, ERK), which trigger inflammatory signaling, and whose activities are inhibited by HO-1. Further, KKC080096 upregulated anti-inflammatory marker (Arg1, YM1, CD206, IL-10, transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β]) expression. In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated mice, KKC080096 lowered microglial activation, protected the nigral dopaminergic neurons, and nigral damage-associated motor deficits. Next, we elucidated the mechanisms by which KKC080096 upregulated HO-1. KKC080096 induced the phosphorylation of AMPK and its known upstream kinases LKB1 and CaMKKbeta, and pharmacological inhibition of AMPK activity reduced the effects of KKC080096 on HO-1 expression and LPS-induced NO generation, suggesting that KKC080096-induced HO-1 upregulation involves LKB1/AMPK and CaMKKbeta/AMPK pathway activation. Further, KKC080096 caused an increase in cellular Nrf2 level, bound to Keap1 (Nrf2 inhibitor protein) with high affinity, and blocked Keap1-Nrf2 interaction. This Nrf2 activation resulted in concurrent induction of HO-1 and other Nrf2-targeted antioxidant enzymes in BV-2 and in dopaminergic CATH.a cells. These results indicate that KKC080096 is a potential therapeutic for oxidative stress- and inflammation-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Summary
Canonical CRISPR-Cas systems utilize RNA-guided nucleases for targeted cleavage of foreign nucleic acids, whereas some nuclease-deficient CRISPR-Cas complexes have been repurposed to direct the insertion of Tn7-like transposons. Here, we established a bioinformatic and experimental pipeline to comprehensively explore the diversity of Type I-F CRISPR-associated transposons. We report DNA integration for 20 systems and identify a highly active subset that exhibits complete orthogonality in transposon DNA mobilization. We reveal the modular nature of CRISPR-associated transposons by exploring the horizontal acquisition of targeting modules and by characterizing a system that encodes both a programmable, RNA-dependent pathway, and a fixed, RNA-independent pathway. Finally, we analyzed transposon-encoded cargo genes and found the striking presence of anti-phage defense systems, suggesting a role in transmitting innate immunity between bacteria. Collectively, this study substantially advances our biological understanding of CRISPR-associated transposon function and expands the suite of RNA-guided transposases for programmable, large-scale genome engineering.

Abstract: Summary
Although the neurogenesis-enhancing effects of exercise have been extensively studied, the molecular mechanisms underlying this response remain unclear. Here, we propose that this is mediated by the exercise-induced systemic release of the antioxidant selenium transport protein, selenoprotein P (SEPP1). Using knockout mouse models, we confirmed that SEPP1 and its receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8) are required for the exercise-induced increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In vivo selenium infusion increased hippocampal neural precursor cell (NPC) proliferation and adult neurogenesis. Mimicking the effect of exercise through dietary selenium supplementation restored neurogenesis and reversed the cognitive decline associated with aging and hippocampal injury, suggesting potential therapeutic relevance. These results provide a molecular mechanism linking exercise-induced changes in the systemic environment to the activation of quiescent hippocampal NPCs and their subsequent recruitment into the neurogenic trajectory.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) leads to considerable morbidity, yet strategies for therapeutic angiogenesis fall short of being impactful. Inflammatory macrophage subsets play an important role in orchestrating post-developmental angiogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we find that macrophage VEGF-A expression is dependent upon the potent inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. IL-1β promotes pro-angiogenic VEGF-A165a isoform transcription via activation and promoter binding of STAT3 and NF-κB, as demonstrated by gene-deletion, gain-of-function, inhibition, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Conversely, IL-1β-deletion or inhibition of STAT3 or NF-κB increases anti-angiogenic VEGF-A165b isoform expression, indicating IL-1β signaling may also direct splice variant selection. In an experimental PAD model of acute limb ischemia, macrophage IL-1β expression is required for pro-angiogenic VEGF-A expression and for VEGF-A-induced blood flow recovery via angio- or arteriogenesis. Though further study is needed, macrophage IL-1β-dependent transcription of VEGF-A via STAT3 and NF-κB may have potential to therapeutically promote angiogenesis in the setting of PAD.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells adapt to hypoxia through HIFs (hypoxia-inducible factors), which initiate the transcription of numerous genes for cancer cell survival in the hypoxia microenvironment. In this study, we find that the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex works cooperatively with HIFs to facilitate the expeditious expression of HIF targets for hypoxia adaptation. Knockout (KO) of the FACT complex abolishes HIF-mediated transcription by impeding transcription elongation in hypoxic cancer cells. Interestingly, the FACT complex is post-translationally regulated by PHD/VHL-mediated hydroxylation and proteasomal degradation, in similar fashion to HIF-1/2α. Metabolic tracing confirms that FACT KO suppresses glycolytic flux and impairs lactate extrusion, leading to intracellular acidification and apoptosis in cancer cells. Therapeutically, hepatic artery ligation and anti-angiogenic inhibitors adversely induce intratumoral hypoxia, while co-treatment with FACT inhibitor curaxin remarkably hinders the growth of hypoxic tumors. In summary, our findings suggest that the FACT complex is a critical component of hypoxia adaptation and a therapeutic target for hypoxic tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical expansion in primate brains relies on enlargement of germinal zones during a prolonged developmental period. Although most mammals have two cortical germinal zones, the ventricular zone (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ), gyrencephalic species display an additional germinal zone, the outer subventricular zone (oSVZ), which increases the number and diversity of neurons generated during corticogenesis. How the oSVZ emerged during evolution is poorly understood, but recent studies suggest a role for non-coding RNAs, which allow tight genetic program regulation during development. Here, using in vivo functional genetics, single-cell RNA sequencing, live imaging, and electrophysiology to assess progenitor and neuronal properties in mice, we identify two oSVZ-expressed microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-137 and miR-122, which regulate key cellular features of cortical expansion. miR-137 promotes basal progenitor self-replication and superficial layer neuron fate, whereas miR-122 decreases the pace of neuronal differentiation. These findings support a cell-type-specific role of miRNA-mediated gene expression in cortical expansion.

Abstract: Summary
Human cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection have been documented throughout the pandemic, but are likely under-reported. In the current study, we use the Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model to assess reinfection with homologous WA1 and heterologous B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta) SARS-CoV-2 variants over time. Upon primary infection with SARS-CoV-2 WA1, hamsters rapidly develop a strong and long-lasting humoral immune response. After reinfection with homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants, this immune response protects hamsters from clinical disease, virus replication in the lower respiratory tract, and acute lung pathology. However, reinfection leads to SARS-CoV-2 replication in the upper respiratory tract with the potential for virus shedding. Our findings indicate that reinfection results in restricted SARS-CoV-2 replication despite substantial levels of humoral immunity, denoting the potential for transmission through reinfected asymptomatic individuals.

Abstract: Summary
A little-appreciated feature of early pregnancy is that embryo implantation and placental outgrowth do not evoke wound-healing responses in the decidua, the specialized endometrial tissue that surrounds the conceptus. Here, we provide evidence that this phenomenon is partly due to an active program of gene silencing mediated by EZH2, a histone methyltransferase that generates repressive histone 3 lysine 27 trimethyl (H3K27me3) histone marks. We find that pregnancies in mice with EZH2-deficient decidual stromal cells frequently fail by mid-gestation, with the decidua showing ectopic myofibroblast formation, peri-embryonic collagen deposition, and gene expression profiles associated with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-driven fibroblast activation and fibrogenic extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Analogous responses are observed when the mutant decidua is surgically wounded, while blockade of TGF-β receptor signaling inhibits the defects and improves reproductive outcomes. Together, these results highlight a critical feature of reproductive success and have implications for the context-specific control of TGF-β-mediated wound-healing responses elsewhere in the body.

Abstract: The isoform 2 of sodium-calcium exchanger family (NCX2) is selectively expressed in neuronal and glial cells where it participates in Ca2+-clearance following neuronal depolarization, synaptic plasticity, hippocampal-dependent learning and memory consolidation processes. On the other hand, NCX2 is also involved in a neuroprotective effect following stroke. Despite the relevance of this antiporter under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, no studies have been reported on its genetic/epigenetic regulation. Therefore, we identified, cloned, and characterized a transcriptional regulatory region (R3) of rat Slc8a2 gene encoding for NCX2. In particular, R3 sequence displayed a promoter activity in PC12, SH-SY5Y and U87MG cell lines consistent with their endogenous NCX2 expression levels. On the other hand, R3 failed to induce detectable luciferase activity in BHK cell line that does not express NCX2 under control conditions. These data support the hypothesis that R3 represents the promoter region of NCX2. Moreover, among several conserved binding sequences for transcription factors identified by in-silico analysis, we evaluated the transcriptional regulation and the binding sites of Sp1, Sp4, NFkB1, GATA2 and CREB1 on R3 sequence by using site-direct mutagenesis and ChIP assays. In particular, transfection of Sp1, Sp4, and CREB1 enhanced both R3 promoter activity and NCX2 transcription in PC12 cell line. More important, CREB1 transfection also enhanced NCX2 protein levels and NCX reverse mode activity in PC12 cells. Altogether, these data suggested that: (i) the identified region contained the regulatory promoter of the antiporter; (ii) NCX2 might represent a downstream effector of transcription factors involved in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival.

Abstract: Summary
Deficiency of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein seipin results in generalized lipodystrophy by incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we report mitochondrial abnormalities in seipin-deficient patient cells. A subset of seipin is enriched at ER-mitochondria contact sites (MAMs) in human and mouse cells and localizes in the vicinity of calcium regulators SERCA2, IP3R, and VDAC. Seipin association with MAM calcium regulators is stimulated by fasting-like stimuli, while seipin association with lipid droplets is promoted by lipid loading. Acute seipin removal does not alter ER calcium stores but leads to defective mitochondrial calcium import accompanied by a widespread reduction in Krebs cycle metabolites and ATP levels. In mice, inducible seipin deletion leads to mitochondrial dysfunctions preceding the development of metabolic complications. Together, these data suggest that seipin controls mitochondrial energy metabolism by regulating mitochondrial calcium influx at MAMs. In seipin-deficient adipose tissue, reduced ATP production compromises adipocyte properties, contributing to lipodystrophy pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Thymic atrophy reduces naive T cell production and contributes to increased susceptibility to viral infection with age. Expression of tissue-restricted antigen (TRA) genes also declines with age and has been thought to increase autoimmune disease susceptibility. We find that diminished expression of a model TRA gene in aged thymic stromal cells correlates with impaired clonal deletion of cognate T cells recognizing an autoantigen involved in atherosclerosis. Clonal deletion in the polyclonal thymocyte population is also perturbed. Distinct age-associated defects in the generation of antigen-specific T cells include a conspicuous decline in generation of T cells recognizing an immunodominant influenza epitope. Increased catalase activity delays thymic atrophy, and here, we show that it mitigates declining production of influenza-specific T cells and their frequency in lung after infection, but does not reverse declines in TRA expression or efficient negative selection. These results reveal important considerations for strategies to restore thymic function.

Abstract: Summary
It is unknown whether transient transgenerational epigenetic responses to environmental challenges affect the process of evolution, which typically unfolds over many generations. Here, we show that in C. elegans, inherited small RNAs control genetic variation by regulating the crucial decision of whether to self-fertilize or outcross. We found that under stressful temperatures, younger hermaphrodites secrete a male-attracting pheromone. Attractiveness transmits transgenerationally to unstressed progeny via heritable small RNAs and the Argonaute Heritable RNAi Deficient-1 (HRDE-1). We identified an endogenous small interfering RNA pathway, enriched in endo-siRNAs that target sperm genes, that transgenerationally regulates sexual attraction, male prevalence, and outcrossing rates. Multigenerational mating competition experiments and mathematical simulations revealed that over generations, animals that inherit attractiveness mate more and their alleles spread in the population. We propose that the sperm serves as a “stress-sensor” that, via small RNA inheritance, promotes outcrossing in challenging environments when increasing genetic variation is advantageous.

Abstract: This study evaluated the effects of combined OncoTherad immunotherapy and probiotic supplementation on colorectal carcinogenesis chemically induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) in mice. The animals were randomly allocated in five groups: Control, DMH: did not receive any treatment; DMH + OncoTherad: received weekly I.P. (intraperitoneal) dose of OncoTherad; DMH + Probiotic: received daily administrations via gavage of the functional food (Lactobacillus: acidophilus and paracasei, Bifidobacterium: lactis and bifidum) and DMH + Probiotic + OncoTherad: received the same treatment than the previous groups. After ten weeks of treatment, the large intestine was collected for immunohistochemical analysis of TLR4, MyD88, NF-κB, IL-6, TLR2, TRIF, IRF-3, IFN-γ, Ki-67, KRAS, IL-10, and TGF-β. For the statistical analysis, the variance tests (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis were used and significance set at p < 0.05. Probiotic supplementation associated with the OncoTherad were able to modulate weight loss, stimulate the canonical signaling pathway TLR2/TLR4 (MyD88-dependent), reduce the non-canonical signaling pathway (TRIF-dependent), attenuate the proliferative pathway mediated by Ki-67 and KRAS oncogene, and stimulate the production of IL-10 and TGF-β cytokines. Thus, the association of OncoTherad and probiotic supplementation has shown important immudomulatory effects and could be considered a potential new therapeutic approach for colorectal cancer after further investigations.

Abstract: Summary
Previous structural studies of the initiation-elongation transition of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription have relied on the use of synthetic oligonucleotides, often artificially discontinuous to capture pol II in the initiating state. Here, we report multiple structures of initiation complexes converted de novo from a 33-subunit yeast pre-initiation complex (PIC) through catalytic activities and subsequently stalled at different template positions. We determine that PICs in the initially transcribing complex (ITC) can synthesize a transcript of ∼26 nucleotides before transitioning to an elongation complex (EC) as determined by the loss of general transcription factors (GTFs). Unexpectedly, transition to an EC was greatly accelerated when an ITC encountered a downstream EC stalled at promoter proximal regions and resulted in a collided head-to-end dimeric EC complex. Our structural analysis reveals a dynamic state of TFIIH, the largest of GTFs, in PIC/ITC with distinct functional consequences at multiple steps on the pathway to elongation.

Abstract: Summary
In all multicellular organisms, transcriptional networks orchestrate organ development. The Arabidopsis root, with its simple structure and indeterminate growth, is an ideal model for investigating the spatiotemporal transcriptional signatures underlying developmental trajectories. To map gene expression dynamics across root cell types and developmental time, we built a comprehensive, organ-scale atlas at single-cell resolution. In addition to estimating developmental progressions in pseudotime, we employed the mathematical concept of optimal transport to infer developmental trajectories and identify their underlying regulators. To demonstrate the utility of the atlas to interpret new datasets, we profiled mutants for two key transcriptional regulators at single-cell resolution, shortroot and scarecrow. We report transcriptomic and in vivo evidence for tissue trans-differentiation underlying a mixed cell identity phenotype in scarecrow. Our results support the atlas as a rich community resource for unraveling the transcriptional programs that specify and maintain cell identity to regulate spatiotemporal organ development.

Abstract: Summary
Synthetic lethality through combinatorial targeting DNA damage response (DDR) pathways provides exciting anticancer therapeutic benefit. Currently, the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in tumor drug resistance; however, their potential significance in DDR is still largely unknown. Here, we report that a human lncRNA, CTD-2256P15.2, encodes a micropeptide, named PAR-amplifying and CtIP-maintaining micropeptide (PACMP), with a dual function to maintain CtIP abundance and promote poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. PACMP not only prevents CtIP from ubiquitination through inhibiting the CtIP-KLHL15 association but also directly binds DNA damage-induced poly(ADP-ribose) chains to enhance PARP1-dependent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Targeting PACMP alone inhibits tumor growth by causing a synthetic lethal interaction between CtIP and PARP inhibitions and confers sensitivity to PARP/ATR/CDK4/6 inhibitors, ionizing radiation, epirubicin, and camptothecin. Our findings reveal that a lncRNA-derived micropeptide regulates cancer progression and drug resistance by modulating DDR, whose inhibition could be employed to augment the existing anticancer therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is an RNA-like polymer that regulates an increasing number of biological processes. Dysregulation of PAR is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal protein aggregation, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). PAR forms condensates with FUS, an RNA-binding protein linked with ALS, through an unknown mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that a strikingly low concentration of PAR (1 nM) is sufficient to trigger condensation of FUS near its physiological concentration (1 μM), which is three orders of magnitude lower than the concentration at which RNA induces condensation (1 μM). Unlike RNA, which associates with FUS stably, PAR interacts with FUS transiently, triggering FUS to oligomerize into condensates. Moreover, inhibition of a major PAR-synthesizing enzyme, PARP5a, diminishes FUS condensation in cells. Despite their structural similarity, PAR and RNA co-condense with FUS, driven by disparate modes of interaction with FUS. Thus, we uncover a mechanism by which PAR potently seeds FUS condensation.

Abstract: Summary
ATRX, a chromatin remodeler protein, is recurrently mutated in H3F3A-mutant pediatric glioblastoma (GBM) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant grade 2/3 adult glioma. Previous work has shown that ATRX-deficient GBM cells show enhanced sensitivity to irradiation, but the etiology remains unclear. We find that ATRX binds the regulatory elements of cell-cycle phase transition genes in GBM cells, and there is a marked reduction in Checkpoint Kinase 1 (CHEK1) expression with ATRX loss, leading to the early release of G2/M entry after irradiation. ATRX-deficient cells exhibit enhanced activation of master cell-cycle regulator ATM with irradiation. Addition of the ATM inhibitor AZD0156 doubles median survival in mice intracranially implanted with ATRX-deficient GBM cells, which is not seen in ATRX-wild-type controls. This study demonstrates that ATRX-deficient high-grade gliomas (HGGs) display Chk1-mediated dysregulation of cell-cycle phase transitions, which opens a window for therapies targeting this phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
It is well known that interferon (IFN)-α/-β activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and suppresses viral replication through the induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). Here, we report that knockout of HDAC3 from macrophages results in the decreased expression of STAT1 and STAT2, leading to defective antiviral immunity in cells and mice. Further studies show that HDAC3 interacts with a conserved transcription factor Forkhead Box K1 (FOXK1), co-localizes with FOXK1 at the promoter of STAT1 and STAT2, and is required for protecting FOXK1 from lysosomal system-mediated degradation. FOXK1-deficient macrophages also show low STAT1 and STAT2 expression with defective responses to viruses. Thus, our studies uncover the biological importance of HDAC3 in regulating the antiviral immunity of macrophages through interacting with FOXK1 to regulate the expression of STAT1 and STAT2.

Abstract: Summary
The spliceosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing and genome stability maintenance. Disruption of the spliceosome activity may lead to developmental disorders and tumorigenesis. However, the physiological role that the spliceosome plays in B cell development and function is still poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 39 (Usp39), a spliceosome component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex, is essential for B cell development. Ablation of Usp39 in B cell lineage blocks pre-pro-B to pro-B cell transition in the bone marrow, leading to a profound reduction of mature B cells in the periphery. We show that Usp39 specifically regulates immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in a spliceosome-dependent manner, which involves modulating chromatin interactions at the Igh locus. Moreover, our results indicate that Usp39 deletion reduces the pre-malignant B cells in Eμ-Myc transgenic mice and significantly improves their survival.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a well-established driver of colon cancer; however, a targeted therapeutic agent has not reached clinics yet. In the present study, we report that the natural compound liquidambaric acid (LDA) inhibits oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vitro and in vivo through its direct target tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). Mechanistically, TRAF2 positively regulates Wnt signaling by interacting with the N-terminal of β-catenin via its TRAF-C domain; this interaction is disrupted in presence of LDA. Particularly, a TRAF2/β-catenin/TCF4/TNIK complex is present in colon cancer cells, where TRAF2 is indispensable for the complex formation, and TRAF2/β-catenin and β-catenin/TCF4 interactions are disrupted upon LDA treatment. Our findings not only highlight that TRAF2 is an oncogenic regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and colon cancer but also provide a lead compound targeting TRAF2 for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) is a multifunctional quorum sensing molecule of key importance to P. aeruginosa. Here, we report that the lytic Pseudomonas bacterial virus LUZ19 targets this population density-dependent signaling system by expressing quorum sensing targeting protein (Qst) early during infection. We demonstrate that Qst interacts with PqsD, a key host quinolone signal biosynthesis pathway enzyme, resulting in decreased levels of PQS and its precursor 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone. The lack of a functional PqsD enzyme impairs LUZ19 infection but is restored by external supplementation of 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone, suggesting that LUZ19 exploits the PQS system for successful infection. We establish a broad functional interaction network of Qst, which includes enzymes of cofactor biosynthesis pathways (CoaC/ThiD) and a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase pathway (PA1217). Qst therefore represents an exquisite example of intricate reprogramming of the bacterium by a phage, which may be further exploited as tool to combat antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Exposing animals to an enriched environment (EE) has dramatic effects on brain structure, function, and plasticity. The poorly known “EE-derived signals'' mediating the EE effects are thought to be generated within the central nervous system. Here, we shift the focus to the body periphery, revealing that gut microbiota signals are crucial for EE-driven plasticity. Developmental analysis reveals striking differences in intestinal bacteria composition between EE and standard rearing (ST) mice, as well as enhanced levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in EE mice. Depleting the microbiota of EE mice with antibiotics strongly decreases SCFA and prevents activation of adult ocular dominance plasticity, spine dynamics, and microglia rearrangement. SCFA treatment in ST mice mimics EE induction of ocular dominance plasticity and microglial remodeling. Remarkably, transferring the microbiota of EE mice to ST recipients activates adult ocular dominance plasticity. Thus, experience-dependent changes in gut microbiota regulate brain plasticity.

Abstract: Summary
We have used a combination of chemical genetics, chromatin proteomics, and imaging to map the earliest chromatin transactions during vertebrate cell entry into mitosis. Chicken DT40 CDK1as cells undergo synchronous mitotic entry within 15 min following release from a 1NM-PP1-induced arrest in late G2. In addition to changes in chromatin association with nuclear pores and the nuclear envelope, earliest prophase is dominated by changes in the association of ribonucleoproteins with chromatin, particularly in the nucleolus, where pre-rRNA processing factors leave chromatin significantly before RNA polymerase I. Nuclear envelope barrier function is lost early in prophase, and cytoplasmic proteins begin to accumulate on the chromatin. As a result, outer kinetochore assembly appears complete by nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). Most interphase chromatin proteins remain associated with chromatin until NEBD, after which their levels drop sharply. An interactive proteomic map of chromatin transactions during mitotic entry is available as a resource at https://mitoChEP.bio.ed.ac.uk.

Abstract: In comparison with normal cells, cancer cells are equipped with a higher number of lysosomes, involved in degradative and non-degradative roles. In particular, the lysosome is a Ca2+signalling hub, and the enhancement of this interconnected machinery in cancer cells has recently prompted investigations into the role that lysosomal ion channels play in oncology. The present review reports findings about the emerging role of lysosomal Ca2+channels: Two-Pore Channels (TPCs), Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channels (TRPMLs; mucolipins), and Purinergic X Receptor 4 (P2×4R), in a variety of cancer models, highlighting their impact on crucial functions such as the regulation of autophagy and the composition of the tumour microenvironment, including the secretion-mediated interplay with immune and endothelial cells. Notably, recent evidence indicates that, by regulating tumour secretome, lysosomal Ca2+ signalling can affect the composition of the tumour-infiltrating immune cell repertoire. Intriguingly, the data so far available show that the protumoral/antitumoral role of lysosomal Ca2+ channels can differ according to the specific genetic context, types of cancer and the malignancy stage, and signals from the microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Mitophagy is a quality control mechanism that eliminates damaged mitochondria, yet its significance in mammalian pathophysiology and aging has remained unclear. Here, we report that mitophagy contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle of aged mice and human patients. The early disease stage is characterized by muscle fibers with central nuclei, with enhanced mitophagy around these nuclei. However, progressive mitochondrial dysfunction halts mitophagy and disrupts lysosomal homeostasis. Interestingly, activated or halted mitophagy occur in a mosaic manner even in adjacent muscle fibers, indicating cell-autonomous regulation. Rapamycin restores mitochondrial turnover, indicating mTOR-dependence of mitochondrial recycling in advanced disease stage. Our evidence suggests that (1) mitophagy is a hallmark of age-related mitochondrial pathology in mammalian muscle, (2) mosaic halting of mitophagy is a mechanism explaining mosaic respiratory chain deficiency and accumulation of pathogenic mtDNA variants in adult-onset mitochondrial diseases and normal aging, and (3) augmenting mitophagy is a promising therapeutic approach for muscle mitochondrial dysfunction.

Abstract: Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a Ca2+ influx pathway present in practically every cell type in metazoans and mediates a variety of physiological functions. Defects in SOCE are associated with immunodeficiencies and defects in skeletal muscle development and function. The molecular machinery underpinning SOCE can be complex and cell type specific, however the minimal functional SOCE unit consists of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensor STIM1 and the plasma membrane (PM) Ca2+-selective channel Orai1. STIM1 localizes to ER-PM contact sites (CS) following store depletion, where it recruits and gates Orai1. STIM1 is a phosphoprotein that is hyper-phosphorylated during cell division. STIM1 phosphorylation has been implicated in several functions, including modulation of cellular metabolism, SOCE inactivation during M-phase, ER segregation during mitosis, modulation of SOCE levels, and cell migration. However, the role of STIM1 phosphorylation in the majority of these processes is controversial bringing into question the physiological function of STIM1 phosphorylation, if any. Here we review the role and modulation of STIM1 phosphorylation under various conditions and argue that except for the modulation of energy metabolism, the physiological function of STIM1 phosphorylation remains unclear.

Abstract: Summary
In mammals, white adipose tissues are largely divided into visceral epididymal adipose tissue (EAT) and subcutaneous inguinal adipose tissue (IAT) with distinct metabolic properties. Although emerging evidence suggests that subpopulations of adipose stem cells (ASCs) would be important to explain fat depot differences, ASCs of two fat depots have not been comparatively investigated. Here, we characterized heterogeneous ASCs and examined the effects of intrinsic and tissue micro-environmental factors on distinct ASC features. We demonstrated that ASC subpopulations in EAT and IAT exhibited different molecular features with three adipogenic stages. ASC transplantation experiments revealed that intrinsic ASC features primarily determined their adipogenic potential. Upon obesogenic stimuli, EAT-specific SDC1+ ASCs promoted fibrotic remodeling, whereas IAT-specific CXCL14+ ASCs suppressed macrophage infiltration. Moreover, IAT-specific BST2high ASCs exhibited a high potential to become beige adipocytes. Collectively, our data broaden the understanding of ASCs with new insights into the origin of white fat depot differences.

Abstract: Summary
Alpha-synuclein (αS) is causally involved in the development of Parkinson disease (PD); however, its role in normal vertebrate physiology has remained unknown. Recent studies demonstrate that αS is induced by noroviral infection in the enteric nervous system of children and protects mice against lethal neurotropic viral infection. Additionally, αS is a potent chemotactic activator of phagocytes. In this report, using both wild-type and αS knockout mice, we show that αS is a critical mediator of inflammatory and immune responses. αS is required for the development of a normal inflammatory response to bacterial peptidoglycan introduced into the peritoneal cavity as well as antigen-specific and T cell responses following intraperitoneal immunization. Furthermore, we show that neural cells are the sources of αS required for immune competence. Our report supports the hypothesis that αS accumulates within the nervous system of PD individuals because of an inflammatory/immune response.

Abstract: Summary
Cell injury poses a substantial challenge for epithelia homeostasis. Several cellular processes preserve epithelial barriers in response to apoptosis, but less is known about other forms of cell death, such as pyroptosis. Here we use an inducible caspase-1 system to analyze how colon epithelial monolayers respond to pyroptosis. We confirm that sporadic pyroptotic cells are physically eliminated from confluent monolayers by apical extrusion. This is accompanied by a transient defect in barrier function at the site of the pyroptotic cells. By visualizing cell shape changes and traction patterns in combination with cytoskeletal inhibitors, we show that rapid lamellipodial responses in the neighbor cells are responsible for correcting the leakage and resealing the barrier. Cell contractility is not required for this resealing response, in contrast to the response to apoptosis. Therefore, pyroptosis elicits a distinct homeostatic response from the epithelium that is driven by the stimulation of lamellipodia in neighbor cells.

Abstract: Summary
Melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells, are replenished from multiple stem cell niches in adult tissue. Although pigmentation traits are known risk factors for melanoma, we know little about melanocyte stem cell (McSC) populations other than hair follicle McSCs and lack key lineage markers with which to identify McSCs and study their function. Here we find that Tfap2b and a select set of target genes specify an McSC population at the dorsal root ganglia in zebrafish. Functionally, Tfap2b is required for only a few late-stage embryonic melanocytes, and is essential for McSC-dependent melanocyte regeneration. Fate mapping data reveal that tfap2b+ McSCs have multifate potential, and are the cells of origin for large patches of adult melanocytes, two other pigment cell types (iridophores and xanthophores), and nerve-associated cells. Hence, Tfap2b confers McSC identity in early development, distinguishing McSCs from other neural crest and pigment cell lineages, and retains multifate potential in the adult zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
MEK1 and MEK2, the only known activators of ERK, are attractive therapeutic candidates for both cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, how MEK signaling finely regulates immune cell activation is only partially understood. To address this question, we specifically delete Mek1 in hematopoietic cells in the Mek2 null background. Characterization of an allelic series of Mek mutants reveals the presence of distinct degrees of spontaneous B cell activation, which are inversely proportional to the levels of MEK proteins and ERK activation. While Mek1 and Mek2 null mutants have a normal lifespan, 1Mek1 and 1Mek2 mutants retaining only one functional Mek1 or Mek2 allele in hematopoietic cell lineages die from glomerulonephritis and lymphoproliferative disorders, respectively. This establishes that the fine-tuning of the ERK/MAPK pathway is critical to regulate B and T cell activation and function and that each MEK isoform plays distinct roles during lymphocyte activation and disease development.

Abstract: Summary
More than 40% of the germline variants in ClinVar today are variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). These variants remain unclassified in part because the patient-level data needed for their interpretation is siloed. Federated analysis can overcome this problem by “bringing the code to the data”: analyzing the sensitive patient-level data computationally within its secure home institution and providing researchers with valuable insights from data that would not otherwise be accessible. We tested this principle with a federated analysis of breast cancer clinical data at RIKEN, derived from the BioBank Japan repository. We were able to analyze these data within RIKEN’s secure computational framework without the need to transfer the data, gathering evidence for the interpretation of several variants. This exercise represents an approach to help realize the core charter of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH): to responsibly share genomic data for the benefit of human health.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue sensitivity and response to exercise vary according to the time of day and alignment of circadian clocks, but the optimal exercise time to elicit a desired metabolic outcome is not fully defined. To understand how tissues independently and collectively respond to timed exercise, we applied a systems biology approach. We mapped and compared global metabolite responses of seven different mouse tissues and serum after an acute exercise bout performed at different times of the day. Comparative analyses of intra- and inter-tissue metabolite dynamics, including temporal profiling and blood sampling across liver and hindlimb muscles, uncovered an unbiased view of local and systemic metabolic responses to exercise unique to time of day. This comprehensive atlas of exercise metabolism provides clarity and physiological context regarding the production and distribution of canonical and novel time-dependent exerkine metabolites, such as 2-hydroxybutyrate (2-HB), and reveals insight into the health-promoting benefits of exercise on metabolism.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigating whether lncRNA H19 promotes myocardial fibrosis by suppressing the miR-29a-3p/miR-29b-3p-VEGFA/TGF-β axis. Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and healthy volunteers were included in the study, and their biochemical parameters were collected. In addition, pcDNA3.1-H19, si-H19, and miR-29a/b-3p mimic/inhibitor were transfected into cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), and proliferation of CFs was detected by MTT assay. Expression of H19 and miR-29a/b-3p were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen I, collagen II, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and elastin were measured by western blot analysis. The dual luciferase reporter gene assay was carried out to detect the sponging relationship between H19 and miR-29a/b-3p in CFs. Compared with healthy volunteers, the level of plasma H19 was significantly elevated in patients with AF, while miR-29a-3p and miR-29b-3p were markedly depressed (P < 0.05). Serum expression of lncRNA H19 was negatively correlated with the expression of miR-29a-3p and miR-29b-3p among patients with AF (rs = –0.337, rs = –0.236). Moreover, up-regulation of H19 expression and down-regulation of miR-29a/b-3p expression facilitated proliferation and synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM)-related proteins. SB431542 and si-VEGFA are able to reverse the promotion of miR-29a/b-3p on proliferation of CFs and ECM-related protein synthesis. The findings of the present study suggest that H19 promoted CF proliferation and collagen synthesis by suppressing the miR-29a-3p/miR-29b-3p-VEGFA/TGF-β axis, and provide support for a potential new direction for the treatment of AF.

Abstract: The apoptosis of proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs) is a critical event of acute kidney injury (AKI). Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 36 (TTC36) with three tetratricopeptide repeats is evolutionarily conserved across mammals, which functions as a chaperone for heat shock protein 70. We have revealed that TTC36 is specifically expressed in PTECs in our previous work. There are few studies about the role of TTC36 in AKI. In this study, we observed that TTC36 was obviously down-regulated in a mouse model of acute kidney injury established by ischemia/reperfusion and its expression was negatively related to the degree of kidney injury. In addition, TTC36 protected HK2 cells against cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we discovered the mechanism that TTC36 mitigated cisplatin-triggered mitochondrial disorder via partially sustaining the membrane potential of mitochondria and mitochondrial autophagy-related gene expression. Collectively, these results suggested that TTC36 plays a protective role in the cisplatin-induced apoptosis of renal tubular cells through maintaining the mitochondrial potential and mitochondrial autophagy-related genes’ expression to some extent. These observations highlight the essential role of TTC36 in regulating PTEC apoptosis and imply TTC36/mitochondrial homeostasis axis as a potential target for the therapeutic intervention in AKI.

Abstract: Many viruses exploit host-cell Ca2+ signaling processes throughout their life cycle. This is especially relevant for viruses that translocate through the endolysosomal system, where cellular infection is keyed to the microenvironment of these acidic Ca2+ stores and Ca2+-dependent trafficking pathways. As regulators of the endolysosomal ionic milieu and trafficking dynamics, two families of endolysosomal Ca2+-permeable cation channels – two pore channels (TPCs) and transient receptor potential mucolipins (TRPMLs) – have emerged as important host-cell factors in viral entry. Here, we review: (i) current evidence implicating Ca2+ signaling in viral translocation through the endolysosomal system, (ii) the roles of these ion channels in supporting cellular infection by different viruses, and (iii) areas for future research that will help define the potential of TPC and TRPML ligands as progressible antiviral agents.

Abstract: Summary
Inexorable increases in insulin resistance, lipolysis, and hepatic glucose production (HGP) are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes. Previously, we showed that peripheral delivery of exogenous fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) has robust anti-diabetic effects mediated by the adipose FGF receptor (FGFR) 1. However, its mechanism of action is not known. Here, we report that FGF1 acutely lowers HGP by suppressing adipose lipolysis. On a molecular level, FGF1 inhibits the cAMP-protein kinase A axis by activating phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), which separates it mechanistically from the inhibitory actions of insulin via PDE3B. We identify Ser44 as an FGF1-induced regulatory phosphorylation site in PDE4D that is modulated by the feed-fast cycle. These findings establish the FGF1/PDE4 pathway as an alternate regulator of the adipose-HGP axis and identify FGF1 as an unrecognized regulator of fatty acid homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Gene expression profiling and proteome analysis of normal and malignant hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) point to shared core stemness properties. However, discordance between mRNA and protein signatures highlights an important role for post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) in governing this critical nexus. Here, we identify miR-130a as a regulator of HSC self-renewal and differentiation. Enforced expression of miR-130a impairs B lymphoid differentiation and expands long-term HSCs. Integration of protein mass spectrometry and chimeric AGO2 crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) identifies TBL1XR1 as a primary miR-130a target, whose loss of function phenocopies miR-130a overexpression. Moreover, we report that miR-130a is highly expressed in t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it is critical for maintaining the oncogenic molecular program mediated by the AML1-ETO complex. Our study establishes that identification of the comprehensive miRNA targetome within primary cells enables discovery of genes and molecular networks underpinning stemness properties of normal and leukemic cells.

Abstract: Summary
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replicates its DNA genome in specialized replication compartments (RCs) in the host cell nucleus. These membrane-less organelles originate as spherical structures and grow in size over time. However, the mechanism of RC biogenesis has remained understudied. Using live-cell imaging and photo-oligomerization, we show that a central component of RCs, the UL112-113 proteins, undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form RCs in the nucleus. We show that the self-interacting domain and large intrinsically disordered regions of UL112-113 are required for LLPS. Importantly, viral DNA induces local clustering of these proteins and lowers the threshold for phase separation. The formation of phase-separated compartments around viral genomes is necessary to recruit the viral DNA polymerase for viral genome replication. Thus, HCMV uses its UL112-113 proteins to generate RCs around viral genomes by LLPS to ensure the formation of a pro-replicative environment.

Previous data suggested that such repression results from inhibition of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) pause release, but here, we show that HS strongly affects other phases of the transcription cycle. Intriguingly, while elongation rates increase upon HS, processivity markedly decreases, so that RNAPII frequently fails to reach the end of genes. Indeed, HS results in widespread premature transcript termination at cryptic, intronic polyadenylation (IPA) sites near gene 5′-ends, likely via inhibition of U1 telescripting. This results in dramatic reconfiguration of the human transcriptome with production of new, previously unannotated, short mRNAs that accumulate in the nucleus. Together, these results shed new light on the basic transcription mechanisms induced by growth at elevated temperature and show that a genome-wide shift toward usage of IPA sites can occur under physiological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Goal-directed behavior requires identifying objects in the environment that can satisfy internal needs and executing actions to obtain those objects. The current study examines ventral and dorsal corticostriatal circuits that support complementary aspects of goal-directed behavior. We analyze activity from the amygdala, ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) while monkeys perform a three-armed bandit task. Information about chosen stimuli and their value is primarily encoded in the amygdala, ventral striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex, while the spatial information is primarily encoded in the LPFC. Before the options are presented, information about the to-be-chosen stimulus is represented in the amygdala, ventral striatum, and orbitofrontal cortex; at the time of choice, the information is passed to the LPFC to direct a saccade. Thus, learned value information specifying behavioral goals is maintained throughout the ventral corticostriatal circuit, and it is routed through the dorsal circuit at the time actions are selected.

Abstract: Summary
Production of effector CD8+ T cells during persistent infection requires a stable pool of stem-like cells that can give rise to effector cells via a proliferative intermediate population. In infection models marked by T cell exhaustion, this process can be transiently induced by checkpoint blockade but occurs spontaneously in mice chronically infected with the protozoan intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. We observe distinct locations for parasite-specific T cell subsets, implying a link between differentiation and anatomical niches in the spleen. Loss of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on T cells does not prevent white pulp-to-red pulp migration but reduces interactions with CXCR3 ligand-producing dendritic cells (DCs) and impairs memory-to-intermediate transition, leading to a buildup of memory T cells in the red pulp. Thus, CXCR3 increases T cell exposure to differentiation-inducing signals during red pulp migration, providing a dynamic mechanism for modulating effector differentiation in response to environmental signals.

Abstract: Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) are considered valuable for regenerative therapy. Although glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is known to play a critical role in cell differentiation, its mechanism of the odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs remains unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the effect and underlying mechanisms of GLUT1 on odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs. hDPSCs was treated with phloretin (Phl), a GLUT1 inhibitor. The impact of GLUT1 on the odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs was analysed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, alizarin-red staining, and western blotting. Glucose uptake by hDPSCs was significantly inhibited by Phl treatment. Overall, inhibition of GLUT1 upregulated the expression of DSPP, DMP1, RUNX2, and OCN and increased the formation of mineralised nodules on odontogenic induction of hDPSCs. The levels of phosphorylated mTOR and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K) were increased after GLUT1 inhibition and decreased by an mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin, Rapa) during the odontogenic induction of hDPSCs. Moreover, mTOR suppression decreased the expression of the genes described above and formation of mineralised nodules. These results suggest that inhibition of GLUT1 promoted the odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs via the mTORC1–p70S6K axis, providing a foundation for further application of hDPSCs in regenerative therapy.

Abstract: Summary
During the 2013–2016 West African (WA) Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak, severe gastrointestinal symptoms were common in patients and associated with poor outcome. Delta peptide is a conserved product of post-translational processing of the abundant EBOV soluble glycoprotein (sGP). The murine ligated ileal loop model was used to demonstrate that delta peptide is a potent enterotoxin. Dramatic intestinal fluid accumulation follows injection of biologically relevant amounts of delta peptide into ileal loops, along with gross alteration of villous architecture and loss of goblet cells. Transcriptomic analyses show that delta peptide triggers damage response and cell survival pathways and downregulates expression of transporters and exchangers. Induction of diarrhea by delta peptide occurs via cellular damage and regulation of genes that encode proteins involved in fluid secretion. While distinct differences exist between the ileal loop murine model and EBOV infection in humans, these results suggest that delta peptide may contribute to EBOV-induced gastrointestinal pathology.

Abstract: Summary
MV130 is an inactivated polybacterial mucosal vaccine that confers protection to patients against recurrent respiratory infections, including those of viral etiology. However, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we find that intranasal prophylaxis with MV130 modulates the lung immune landscape and provides long-term heterologous protection against viral respiratory infections in mice. Intranasal administration of MV130 provides protection against systemic candidiasis in wild-type and Rag1-deficient mice lacking functional lymphocytes, indicative of innate immune-mediated protection. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of trained immunity with metformin abrogates the protection conferred by MV130 against influenza A virus respiratory infection. MV130 induces reprogramming of both mouse bone marrow progenitor cells and in vitro human monocytes, promoting an enhanced cytokine production that relies on a metabolic shift. Our results unveil that the mucosal administration of a fully inactivated bacterial vaccine provides protection against viral infections by a mechanism associated with the induction of trained immunity.

Abstract: Summary
The long-range interactions of cis-regulatory elements (cREs) play a central role in gene regulation. cREs can be characterized as accessible chromatin sequences. However, it remains technically challenging to comprehensively identify their spatial interactions. Here, we report a new method HiCAR (Hi-C on accessible regulatory DNA), which utilizes Tn5 transposase and chromatin proximity ligation, for the analysis of open-chromatin-anchored interactions with low-input cells. By applying HiCAR in human embryonic stem cells and lymphoblastoid cells, we demonstrate that HiCAR identifies high-resolution chromatin contacts with an efficiency comparable with that of in situ Hi-C over all distance ranges. Interestingly, we found that the “poised” gene promoters exhibit silencer-like function to repress the expression of distal genes via promoter-promoter interactions. Lastly, we applied HiCAR to 30,000 primary human muscle stem cells and demonstrated that HiCAR is capable of analyzing chromatin accessibility and looping using low-input primary cells and clinical samples.

Abstract: Summary
The adult neurogenic niche in the hippocampus is maintained through activation of reversibly quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) with radial glia-like morphology (RGLs). Here, we show that the expression of SoxD transcription factors Sox5 and Sox6 is enriched in activated RGLs. Using inducible deletion of Sox5 or Sox6 in the adult mouse brain, we show that both genes are required for RGL activation and the generation of new neurons. Conversely, Sox5 overexpression in cultured NSCs interferes with entry in quiescence. Mechanistically, expression of the proneural protein Ascl1 (a key RGL regulator) is severely downregulated in SoxD-deficient RGLs, and Ascl1 transcription relies on conserved Sox motifs. Additionally, loss of Sox5 hinders the RGL activation driven by neurogenic stimuli such as environmental enrichment. Altogether, our data suggest that SoxD genes are key mediators in the transition of adult RGLs from quiescence to an activated mitotic state under physiological situations.

Abstract: Summary
In the retina, ON starburst amacrine cells (SACs) play a crucial role in the direction-selective circuit, but the sources of inhibition that shape their response properties remain unclear. Previous studies demonstrate that ∼95% of their inhibitory synapses are GABAergic, yet we find that the light-evoked inhibitory currents measured in SACs are predominantly glycinergic. Glycinergic inhibition is extremely slow, relying on non-canonical glycine receptors containing α4 subunits, and is driven by both the ON and OFF retinal pathways. These attributes enable glycine inputs to summate and effectively control the output gain of SACs, expanding the range over which they compute direction. Serial electron microscopic reconstructions reveal three specific types of ON and OFF narrow-field amacrine cells as the presumptive sources of glycinergic inhibition. Together, these results establish an unexpected role for specific glycinergic amacrine cells in the retinal computation of stimulus direction by SACs.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence indicates that both neutralizing and Fc-mediated effector functions of antibodies contribute to protection against SARS-CoV-2. It is unclear whether Fc-effector functions alone can protect against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we isolated CV3-13, a non-neutralizing antibody, from a convalescent individual with potent Fc-mediated effector functions. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of CV3-13 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike reveals that the antibody binds from a distinct angle of approach to an N-terminal domain (NTD) epitope that only partially overlaps with the NTD supersite recognized by neutralizing antibodies. CV3-13 does not alter the replication dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice, but its Fc-enhanced version significantly delays virus spread, neuroinvasion, and death in prophylactic settings. Interestingly, the combination of Fc-enhanced non-neutralizing CV3-13 with Fc-compromised neutralizing CV3-25 completely protects mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Altogether, our data demonstrate that efficient Fc-mediated effector functions can potently contribute to the in vivo efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
Anti-angiogenic therapies, such as anti-VEGF antibodies (AVAs), have shown promise in clinical settings. However, adaptive resistance to such therapies occurs frequently. We use orthotopic ovarian cancer models with AVA-adaptive resistance to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Genomic profiling of AVA-resistant tumors guides us to endothelial p130cas. We find that bevacizumab induces cleavage of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells by caspase-10 and that VEGFR2 fragments internalize into the nucleus and autophagosomes. Nuclear VEGFR2 and p130cas fragments, together with TNKS1BP1 (tankyrase-1-binding protein), initiate endothelial cell death. Blockade of autophagy in AVA-resistant endothelial cells retains VEGFR2 at the membrane with bevacizumab treatment. Targeting host p130cas with RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp)-tagged nanoparticles or genomic ablation of vascular p130cas in p130casflox/floxTie2Cre mice significantly extends the survival of mice with AVA-resistant ovarian tumors. Higher vascular p130cas is associated with shorter survival of individuals with ovarian cancer. Our findings identify opportunities for new strategies to overcome adaptive resistance to AVA therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical processing depends on finely tuned excitatory and inhibitory connections in neuronal microcircuits. Reduced inhibition by somatostatin-expressing interneurons is a key component of altered inhibition associated with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (depression), which is implicated in cognitive deficits and rumination, but the link remains to be better established mechanistically in humans. Here we test the effect of reduced somatostatin interneuron-mediated inhibition on cortical processing in human neuronal microcircuits using a data-driven computational approach. We integrate human cellular, circuit, and gene expression data to generate detailed models of human cortical microcircuits in health and depression. We simulate microcircuit baseline and response activity and find a reduced signal-to-noise ratio and increased false/failed detection of stimuli due to a higher baseline activity in depression. We thus apply models of human cortical microcircuits to demonstrate mechanistically how reduced inhibition impairs cortical processing in depression, providing quantitative links between altered inhibition and cognitive deficits.

Abstract: Summary
Innate-like T cells, including invariant natural killer T cells, mucosal-associated invariant T cells, and γδ T cells, are present in various barrier tissues, including the lung, where they carry out protective responses during infections. Here, we investigate their roles during pulmonary pneumococcal infection. Following infection, innate-like T cells rapidly increase in lung tissue, in part through recruitment, but T cell antigen receptor activation and cytokine production occur mostly in interleukin-17-producing NKT17 and γδ T cells. NKT17 cells are preferentially located within lung tissue prior to infection, as are CD103+ dendritic cells, which are important both for antigen presentation to NKT17 cells and γδ T cell activation. Whereas interleukin-17-producing γδ T cells are numerous, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is exclusive to NKT17 cells and is required for optimal protection. These studies demonstrate how particular cellular interactions and responses of functional subsets of innate-like T cells contribute to protection from pathogenic lung infection.

Abstract: Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous and frequently fatal malignancy. The ten-eleven translocation (TET)-mediated DNA demethylation is known to be critically associated with AML pathogenesis. Through chemical compound screening, we find that the opioid receptor agonist, loperamide hydrochloride (OPA1), significantly suppresses AML cell viability. The potential therapeutic effects of opioid receptor agonists, especially OPA1, are verified in AML cells in vitro and mouse and human AML models in vivo. OPA1-induced activation of OPRM1 signaling enhances the transcription of TET2 and thus activates both catalytic-dependent and -independent functions of TET2. Notably, AMLs with TET2 mutations or chemotherapy resistance are sensitive to OPA1 as well. Our results reveal the OPRM1-TET2 regulatory axis in AML and suggest that opioid agonists, particularly OPA1, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antidiarrheal drug, have therapeutic potential in AML, especially in TET2-mutated and chemotherapy-resistant AMLs, which have a poor prognosis.

Abstract: Summary
Influenza is an important cause of illness and morbidity for infants. Seasonal influenza vaccination during pregnancy aims to provide protection to mothers, but it can also provide immunity to infants. The precise influence of maternal vaccination on immunity in infants and how vaccine-elicited antibodies provide protection in some but not all infants is incompletely understood. We comprehensively profiled the transfer of functional antibodies and defined humoral factors contributing to immunity against influenza in a clinical trial of maternal influenza vaccination. Influenza-specific antibody subclass levels, Fc ɣ receptor (FCGR) binding levels, and antibody-dependent innate immune functions were all profiled in the mothers during pregnancy and at birth, as well as in cord blood. Vaccination increased influenza-specific antibody levels, antibody binding to FCGR, and specific antibody-dependent innate immune functions in both maternal and cord blood, with FCGR binding most enhanced via vaccination. Influenza-specific FCGR binding levels were lower in cord blood of infants who subsequently developed influenza infection. Collectively these data suggest that in addition to increased antibody amounts, the selective transfer of FCGR-binding antibodies contributes to the protective immune response in infants against influenza.

Abstract: Summary
Chemotherapy with anti PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies has become the standard of care for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC). Using lung tumor models, where pemetrexed and cisplatin (PEM/CDDP) chemotherapy remains unable to synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), we linked the failure of this treatment with its inability to induce CXCL10 expression and CD8+ T cell recruitment. Using drug screening, we showed that combining a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) with PEM/CDDP triggers CXCL10 secretion by cancer cells and CD8+ T cell recruitment, sensitizing it to ICIs. PEM/CDDP plus a MEKi promotes optineurin (OPTN)-dependent mitophagy, resulting in CXCL10 production in a mitochondrial DNA- and TLR9-dependent manner. TLR9 or autophagy/mitophagy inhibition abolishes the anti-tumor efficacy of PEM/CDDP plus MEKi/anti-PD-L1 therapy. In human NSCLCs, high OPTN, TLR9, and CXCL10 expression is associated with a better response to ICIs. Our results underline the role of TLR9- and OPTN-dependent mitophagy in enhancing chemoimmunotherapy efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Type I interferons (IFN-I) are essential to establish antiviral innate immunity. Unanchored (or free) polyubiquitin (poly-Ub) has been shown to regulate IFN-I responses. However, few unanchored poly-Ub interactors are known. To identify factors regulated by unanchored poly-Ub in a physiological setting, we developed an approach to isolate unanchored poly-Ub from lung tissue. We identified the RNA helicase DHX16 as a potential pattern recognition receptor (PRR). Silencing of DHX16 in cells and in vivo diminished IFN-I responses against influenza virus. These effects extended to members of other virus families, including Zika and SARS-CoV-2. DHX16-dependent IFN-I production requires RIG-I and unanchored K48-poly-Ub synthesized by the E3-Ub ligase TRIM6. DHX16 recognizes a signal in influenza RNA segments that undergo splicing and requires its RNA helicase motif for direct, high-affinity interactions with specific viral RNAs.

Abstract: MiR-361-3p has been reported in several types of human cancer. However, the expression profile and biological functions of miR-361-3p in osteosarcoma remain uncovered. The expression profiles of miR-361-3p in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines were evaluated using RT-qPCR. In 88 osteosarcoma patients, survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves; while prognostic significance of miR-361-3p was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. The effects of miR-361-3p on cell proliferation, migration and invasion capacities were analyzed using CCK-8 and transwell assays. The target genes of miR-361-3p were assessed using luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR, Western blot and rescue experiments. Xenograft assay was conducted to test tumor growth ability. MiR-361-3p was found to be upregulated in human osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. The expression of miR-361−3p was observed to be closely associated with TNM stage and lung metastasis. High expression of miR-361−3p was found to be capable of predicting poor clinical prognosis in osteosarcoma patients. Whilst overexpression of miR-361−3p was demonstrated to promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells; knockdown of miR-361−3p was shown to exhibit an opposite inhibitory effect. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that ARID3A is a direct target of miR-361−3p. Functional assays demonstrated that osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion were promoted by miR-361−3p via negative regulation of ARID3A. Finally, overexpression of ARID3A was shown to partially reverse the tumor-promoting effect of miR-361-3p. Besides, in vivo assays revealed that miR-361-3p overexpression facilitated tumor growth in nude mice. In conclusion, this study indicates that miR-361-3p is a crucial prognostic biomarker of osteosarcoma, and that targeting of miR-361-3p/ARID3A axis may be a promising strategy in osteosarcoma therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with cognitive dysfunction. Because the hypothalamus is implicated in energy balance control and memory disorders, we hypothesized that specific neurons in this brain region are at the interface of metabolism and cognition. Acute obesogenic diet administration in mice impaired recognition memory due to defective production of the neurosteroid precursor pregnenolone in the hypothalamus. Genetic interference with pregnenolone synthesis by Star deletion in hypothalamic POMC, but not AgRP neurons, deteriorated recognition memory independently of metabolic disturbances. Our data suggest that pregnenolone’s effects on cognitive function were mediated via an autocrine mechanism on POMC neurons, influencing hippocampal long-term potentiation. The relevance of central pregnenolone on cognition was also confirmed in metabolically unhealthy patients with obesity. Our data reveal an unsuspected role for POMC neuron-derived neurosteroids in cognition. These results provide the basis for a framework to investigate new facets of POMC neuron biology with implications for cognitive disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Binding of influenza virus to its receptor triggers signaling cascades that reprogram the cell for infection. To elucidate global virus-induced changes to the cellular signaling landscape, we conducted a quantitative phosphoproteomic screen with human and avian influenza viruses. Proteins with functions in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal remodeling are overrepresented among the hits, and the majority of factors undergoing phosphorylation changes have a significant impact on infection efficiency. We show that influenza virus induces the formation of filopodia through Cdc42 signaling, which results in enhanced virus endocytosis. The host cell counteracts this mechanism with cortactin, a regulator of actin polymerization that becomes phosphorylated in response to virus binding and translocates to the cell cortex, where it limits filopodia formation and virus uptake. Overall, our study reveals the signaling cascades induced by influenza virus receptor engagement and uncovers virus-induced filopodia formation that is counteracted by the host cell.

Abstract: PGE2 is a potent bronchodilator, but the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been fully elucidated. Acetylcholine-induced contractions of airway smooth muscle (ASM) are associated with the generation of repetitive Ca2+ oscillations in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) and the force of contraction is positively correlated with the frequency of the underlying Ca2+ oscillations. The purpose of the present study was to examine if carbachol-evoked Ca2+ oscillations in isolated ASMC were inhibited by PGE2. Isolated murine ASMC loaded with fluo4-AM were imaged with a Nipkow spinning disk confocal microscope. Cells responded to application of CCh (1 μM) by generating an initial Ca2+ transient followed by a series of Ca2+ oscillations. This activity was abolished by PGE2 (300 nM) and the EP2R agonist (R)-butaprost (3 μM) and the inhibitory effects of PGE2 were reversed by application of the EP2R antagonist PF-04418948 (100 nM). Activation of adenylate cyclase using forskolin (1 μM) mimicked the effects of PGE2. The PKA activator, 6-MB-cAMP (300 μM) reduced the frequency of CCh-induced Ca2+ oscillations by 33% and the PKA inhibitor Rp-8-CPT-cAMPs partially reversed the inhibitory effects of PGE2. The EPAC activator 007-AM (10 μM) reduced the frequency of the oscillations by 60% and joint application of 007-AM and 6-MB-cAMP reduced oscillation frequency by ∼85%. CCh-induced Ca2+ oscillations were inhibited by 2-APB and tetracaine, but caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transients were resistant to PGE2. These data suggest that PGE2 inhibits CCh-induced Ca2+ oscillations in murine ASMC via stimulation of EP2Rs and a mechanism involving activation of PKA and EPAC.

Abstract: Summary
Macrophages display phenotypic plasticity and can be induced by hepatitis B virus (HBV) to undergo either M1-like pro-inflammatory or M2-like anti-inflammatory polarization. Here, we report that M1-like macrophages stimulated by HBV exhibit a strong HBV-suppressive effect, which is diminished in M2-like macrophages. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that HBV induces the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in M1-like macrophages, which display a high oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity distinct from that of conventional M1-like macrophages. Further analysis indicates that OXPHOS attenuates the expression of IL-1β, which suppresses the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) in hepatocytes to suppress HBV gene expression and replication. Moreover, multiple HBV proteins can induce the expression of IL-1β in macrophages. Our results thus indicate that macrophages can respond to HBV by producing IL-1β to suppress HBV replication. However, HBV can also metabolically reprogram macrophages to enhance OXPHOS to minimize this host antiviral response.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleus is highly compartmentalized through the formation of distinct classes of membraneless domains. However, the composition and function of many of these structures are not well understood. Using APEX2-mediated proximity labeling and RNA sequencing, we surveyed human transcripts associated with nuclear speckles, several additional domains, and the lamina. Remarkably, speckles and lamina are associated with distinct classes of retained introns enriched in genes that function in RNA processing, translation, and the cell cycle, among other processes. In contrast to the lamina-proximal introns, retained introns associated with speckles are relatively short, GC-rich, and enriched for functional sites of RNA-binding proteins that are concentrated in these domains. They are also highly differentially regulated across diverse cellular contexts, including the cell cycle. Thus, our study provides a resource of nuclear domain-associated transcripts and further reveals speckles and lamina as hubs of distinct populations of retained introns linked to gene regulation and cell cycle progression.

Abstract: Summary
p53, master transcriptional regulator of the genotoxic stress response, controls cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis following DNA damage. Here, we identify a p53-induced lncRNA suicidal PARP-1 cleavage enhancer (SPARCLE) adjacent to miR-34b/c required for p53-mediated apoptosis. SPARCLE is a ∼770-nt, nuclear lncRNA induced 1 day after DNA damage. Despite low expression (<16 copies/cell), SPARCLE deletion increases DNA repair and reduces DNA-damage-induced apoptosis as much as p53 deficiency, while its overexpression restores apoptosis in p53-deficient cells. SPARCLE does not alter gene expression. SPARCLE binds to PARP-1 with nanomolar affinity and causes apoptosis by acting as a caspase-3 cofactor for PARP-1 cleavage, which separates PARP-1’s N-terminal (NT) DNA-binding domain from its catalytic domains. NT-PARP-1 inhibits DNA repair. Expressing NT-PARP-1 in SPARCLE-deficient cells increases unrepaired DNA damage and restores apoptosis after DNA damage. Thus, SPARCLE enhances p53-induced apoptosis by promoting PARP-1 cleavage, which interferes with DNA-damage repair.

Abstract: Summary
Vascular endothelium plays a crucial role in vascular homeostasis and tissue fluid balance. To target endothelium for robust genome editing, we developed poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether-block-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PEG-b-PLGA) copolymer-based nanoparticle formulated with polyethyleneimine. A single i.v. administration of mixture of nanoparticles and plasmid DNA expressing Cas9 controlled by CDH5 promoter and guide RNA (U6 promoter) induced highly efficient genome editing in endothelial cells (ECs) of the vasculatures, including lung, heart, aorta, and peripheral vessels in adult mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining demonstrated an ∼80% decrease of protein expression selectively in ECs, resulting in a phenotype similar to that of genetic knockout mice. Nanoparticle delivery of plasmid DNA could induce genome editing of two genes or genome editing and transgene expression in ECs simultaneously. Thus, nanoparticle delivery of plasmid DNA is a powerful tool to rapidly and efficiently alter expression of gene(s) in ECs for cardiovascular research and potential gene therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons exhibit extensive dendritic and axonal arborizations, but local protein synthesis is not characterized in these neurons. Here, we investigate messenger RNA (mRNA) localization and translation in mDA neuronal axons and dendrites, both of which release dopamine (DA). Using highly sensitive ribosome-bound RNA sequencing and imaging approaches, we find no evidence for mRNA translation in mDA axons. In contrast, mDA neuronal dendrites in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) contain ribosomes and mRNAs encoding the major components of DA synthesis, release, and reuptake machinery. Surprisingly, we also observe dendritic localization of mRNAs encoding synaptic vesicle-related proteins, including those involved in exocytic fusion. Our results are consistent with a role for local translation in the regulation of DA release from dendrites, but not from axons. Our translatome data define a molecular signature of sparse mDA neurons in the SNr, including the enrichment of Atp2a3/SERCA3, an atypical ER calcium pump.

Abstract: Summary
Gut microbiome is of major interest due to its close relationship to health and disease. Bacteria usually vary in gene content, leading to functional variations within species, so resolution higher than species-level methods is needed for ecological and clinical relevance. We design a protocol to identify strains in selected species with high discrimination and in high numbers by amplicon sequencing of the flagellin gene. We apply the protocol to fecal samples from a human diet trial, targeting Escherichia coli. Across the 119 samples from 16 individuals, there are 1,532 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), but only 32 ASVs are dominant in one or more fecal samples, despite frequent dominant strain turnover. Major strains in an intestine are found to be commonly accompanied by a large number of satellite cells, and many are identified as potential extraintestinal pathogens. The protocol could be used to track epidemics or investigate the intra- or inter-host diversity of pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Non-covalent complexes of glycolytic enzymes, called metabolons, were postulated in the 1970s, but the concept has been controversial. Here we show that a c-Myc-responsive long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that we call glycoLINC (gLINC) acts as a backbone for metabolon formation between all four glycolytic payoff phase enzymes (PGK1, PGAM1, ENO1, and PKM2) along with lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). The gLINC metabolon enhances glycolytic flux, increases ATP production, and enables cell survival under serine deprivation. Furthermore, gLINC overexpression in cancer cells promotes xenograft growth in mice fed a diet deprived of serine, suggesting that cancer cells employ gLINC during metabolic reprogramming. We propose that gLINC makes a functional contribution to cancer cell adaptation and provide the first example of a lncRNA-facilitated metabolon.

Abstract: Individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) are affected four times more by tendinopathies than non-diabetics. On the other hand, physical activity helps to DM control. However, the effects of physical exercise in water (PEW) on the fibrocartilages present in the tendons of animals affected by DM are unknown. In this sense, the aim of this study was to analyze the structural organization and chemical composition of fibrocartilage present in the intermediate region of the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of Wistar rats with alloxan-induced DM. Diabetic and non-diabetic animals were randomly separated into four experimental groups (n = 10): Non-Trained Control (NTC), Trained Control (TC), Non-Trained Diabetic (NTD), and Trained Diabetic (TD). TC and TD animals underwent the exercise protocol (total weekly training load - week 1: 14,375; 2: 16,500; 3: 18,375; 4: 20,000) and then were euthanized to collect tendon samples for analysis. The matrix basophilia was more intense in the TC and TD groups. The Decorin immunohistochemical test results showed greater intensity in the NTD and TD groups. The wet weight of the fibrocartilaginous region of the tendon (NTC:19.9 ± 0.06; TC:22.3 ± 0.05; NTD:20.3 ± 0.08; TD:21.8 ± 0.04 mg - p = 0.048), glycosaminoglycan amounts (NTC:3.21 ± 0.18; TC:3.98 ± 0.44; NTD:3.32 ± 0.19; TD:3.79 ± 0.28 μg/mg of fresh tissue - p = 0.046), and intumescence in water (NTC:13.8 ± 3.8; TC:24.3 ± 3.9; NTD:14.9 ± 3.9; TD:28.2 ± 5.3 % w/w - p = 0.042) were higher in the TC and TD groups. The TD group showed the highest levels of type I collagen and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13. The TC group showed the highest and TD the lowest TGF-β1 levels. In conclusion, the PEW was able to stimulate the deposition of proteoglycans, without inducing chemical changes that would cause histopathological modifications in fibrocartilage in the DDFT of adult rats. Thus, PEW preserves the structural organization of these tissues in tendons of animals affected by DM.

Abstract: Ubiquitin (Ub) is post-translationally modified by Ub itself or Ub-like proteins, phosphorylation, and acetylation, among others, which elicits a variety of Ub topologies and cellular functions. However, N-terminal (Nt) modifications of Ub remain unknown, except the linear head-to-tail ubiquitylation via Nt-Met. Here, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and an Nt-arginylated Ub-specific antibody, we found that the detectable level of Ub undergoes Nt-Met excision, Nt-deamination, and Nt-arginylation. The resulting Nt-arginylated Ub and its conjugated proteins are upregulated in the stationary-growth phase or by oxidative stress. We further proved the existence of Nt-arginylated Ub in vivo and identified Nt-arginylated Ub-protein conjugates using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based tandem mass spectrometry. In silico structural modeling of Nt-arginylated Ub predicted that Nt-Arg flexibly protrudes from the surface of the Ub, thereby most likely providing a docking site for the factors that recognize it. Collectively, these results reveal unprecedented Nt-arginylated Ub and the pathway by which it is produced, which greatly expands the known complexity of the Ub code.

Abstract: Summary
The crAss-like phages are a diverse group of related viruses that includes some of the most abundant viruses of the human gut. To explore their diversity and functional role in human population and clinical cohorts, we analyze gut metagenomic data collected from 1,950 individuals from the Netherlands. We identify 1,556 crAss-like phage genomes, including 125 species-level and 32 genus-level clusters absent from the reference databases used. Analysis of their genomic features shows that closely related crAss-like phages can possess strikingly divergent regions responsible for transcription, presumably acquired through recombination. Prediction of crAss-like phage hosts points primarily to bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes, consistent with previous reports. Finally, we explore the temporal stability of crAss-like phages over a 4-year period and identify associations between the abundance of crAss-like phages and several human phenotypes, including depletion of crAss-like phages in inflammatory bowel disease patients.

Abstract: Summary
Still’s disease, the paradigm of autoinflammation-cum-autoimmunity, predisposes for a cytokine storm with excessive T lymphocyte activation upon viral infection. Loss of function of the purine nucleoside enzyme FAMIN is the sole known cause for monogenic Still’s disease. Here we discovered that a FAMIN-enabled purine metabolon in dendritic cells (DCs) restrains CD4+ and CD8+ T cell priming. DCs with absent FAMIN activity prime for enhanced antigen-specific cytotoxicity, IFNγ secretion, and T cell expansion, resulting in excessive influenza A virus-specific responses. Enhanced priming is already manifest with hypomorphic FAMIN-I254V, for which ∼6% of mankind is homozygous. FAMIN controls membrane trafficking and restrains antigen presentation in an NADH/NAD+-dependent manner by balancing flux through adenine-guanine nucleotide interconversion cycles. FAMIN additionally converts hypoxanthine into inosine, which DCs release to dampen T cell activation. Compromised FAMIN consequently enhances immunosurveillance of syngeneic tumors. FAMIN is a biochemical checkpoint that protects against excessive antiviral T cell responses, autoimmunity, and autoinflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Telomeres form unique nuclear compartments that prevent degradation and fusion of chromosome ends by recruiting shelterin proteins and regulating access of DNA damage repair factors. To understand how these dynamic components protect chromosome ends, we combine in vivo biophysical interrogation and in vitro reconstitution of human shelterin. We show that shelterin components form multicomponent liquid condensates with selective biomolecular partitioning on telomeric DNA. Tethering and anomalous diffusion prevent multiple telomeres from coalescing into a single condensate in mammalian cells. However, telomeres coalesce when brought into contact via an optogenetic approach. TRF1 and TRF2 subunits of shelterin drive phase separation, and their N-terminal domains specify interactions with telomeric DNA in vitro. Telomeric condensates selectively recruit telomere-associated factors and regulate access of DNA damage repair factors. We propose that shelterin mediates phase separation of telomeric chromatin, which underlies the dynamic yet persistent nature of the end-protection mechanism.

Abstract: Summary
The coordinated regulation of growth control and metabolic pathways is required to meet the energetic and biosynthetic demands associated with proliferation. Emerging evidence suggests that the Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) reprograms cellular metabolism to meet the anabolic demands of growth, although the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that YAP co-opts the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-dependent lipogenic program to facilitate proliferation and tissue growth. Mechanistically, YAP stimulates de novo lipogenesis via mechanistic target of rapamcyin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and subsequent activation of SREBP. Importantly, YAP-dependent regulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is required to activate mTORC1/SREBP and stimulate de novo lipogenesis. We also find that the SREBP target genes fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) are conditionally required to support YAP-dependent proliferation and tissue growth. These studies reveal that de novo lipogenesis is a metabolic vulnerability that can be targeted to disrupt YAP-dependent proliferation and tissue growth.

Abstract: Summary
Pseudouridine is a modified nucleotide that is prevalent in human mRNAs and is dynamically regulated. Here, we investigate when in their life cycle mRNAs become pseudouridylated to illuminate the potential regulatory functions of endogenous mRNA pseudouridylation. Using single-nucleotide resolution pseudouridine profiling on chromatin-associated RNA from human cells, we identified pseudouridines in nascent pre-mRNA at locations associated with alternatively spliced regions, enriched near splice sites, and overlapping hundreds of binding sites for RNA-binding proteins. In vitro splicing assays establish a direct effect of individual endogenous pre-mRNA pseudouridines on splicing efficiency. We validate hundreds of pre-mRNA sites as direct targets of distinct pseudouridine synthases and show that PUS1, PUS7, and RPUSD4—three pre-mRNA-modifying pseudouridine synthases with tissue-specific expression—control widespread changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing and 3′ end processing. Our results establish a vast potential for cotranscriptional pre-mRNA pseudouridylation to regulate human gene expression via alternative pre-mRNA processing.

Abstract: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the main treatment for advanced prostate cancer (PCa) but resistance results in progression to terminal castrate resistant PCa (CRPC), where there is an unmet therapeutic need. Aberrant intracellular calcium (Cai2+) is known to promote neoplastic transformation and treatment resistance. There is growing evidence that voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) expression is increased in cancer, particularly CACNA1D/CaV1.3 in CRPC. The aim of this study was to investigate if increased CaV1.3 drives resistance to ADT and determine its associated impact on Cai2+ and cancer biology. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that CACNA1D gene expression is increased in ADT treated PCa patients. This was corroborated in both in vivo LNCaP xenograft mouse and in vitro PCa cell line models, which demonstrated a significant increase in CaV1.3 protein expression following ADT with bicalutamide. Expression was found to be of a shortened 170kDa CaV1.3 isoform associated with plasma and intracellular membranes, which failed to induce calcium influx following membrane depolarisation. Instead, under ADT CaV1.3 mediated a rise in basal cytosolic calcium and an increase in store operated calcium entry (SOCE). This mechanism was found to promote the proliferation and survival of ADT resistant CRPC cells. Overall, this study demonstrates for the first time in PCa that under ADT specific CaV1.3 isoforms promote an upregulation of SOCE which contributes to treatment resistance and CRPC biology. Thus, this novel oncochannel represents a target for therapeutic development to improve PCa patient outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Modifications are present on many classes of RNA, including tRNA, rRNA, and mRNA. These modifications modulate diverse biological processes such as genetic recoding and mRNA export and folding. In addition, modifications can be introduced to RNA molecules using chemical probing strategies that reveal RNA structure and dynamics. Many methods exist to detect RNA modifications by short-read sequencing; however, limitations on read length inherent to short-read-based methods dissociate modifications from their native context, preventing single-molecule modification analysis. Here, we demonstrate direct RNA nanopore sequencing to detect endogenous and exogenous RNA modifications on long RNAs at the single-molecule level. We detect endogenous 2′-O-methyl and base modifications across E. coli and S. cerevisiae ribosomal RNAs as shifts in current signal and dwell times distally through interactions with the helicase motor protein. We further use the 2′-hydroxyl reactive SHAPE reagent acetylimidazole to probe RNA structure at the single-molecule level with readout by direct nanopore sequencing.

Abstract: Muscular diseases are characterized by a wide genetic diversity and the Ca2+-signalling machinery is often perturbed. Its characterization is therefore pivotal and requires appropriate cellular models. Muscle biopsies are the best approach but are invasive for the patient and difficult to justify if the biopsy is not for diagnostic purposes. To circumvent this, interest is mounting in urine-derived stem cells that can be differentiated into skeletal muscle cells. In the present study, we isolated stem cells from urine (USC) samples of healthy donors and differentiated them by MyoD lentiviral vector transduction into skeletal muscle cells (USC-SkMC). As expected, USCs and USC-SkMCs are characterized by a radically different pattern of expression of stem and skeletal muscle markers. Characterization of cells in the present manuscript focused on Ca2+-signalling. Undifferentiated and differentiated cells differed in the expression of key proteins involved in Ca2+-homeostasis and also displayed different Ca2+-responses to external stimuli, confirming that during differentiation there was a transition from a non-excitable to an excitable phenotype. In USCs, the main mechanism of calcium entry was IP3 dependent, suggesting a major involvement of receptor-operated Ca2+ entry. Indeed, U-73122 (a PLC inhibitor) significantly inhibited the Ca2+increase triggered by ATP both in calcium and calcium-free conditions. In USC-SkMCs both store- and receptor-operated calcium entry were active. Furthermore, a caffeine challenge led to Ca2+ release both in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium, which was inhibited by ryanodine, suggesting the presence and functionality of ryanodine receptors in USC-SkMCs. Lastly, the voltage-operated calcium channels are operative in USC-SkMCs, unlike in USCs, since stimulation with high concentration of KCl induced a significant calcium transient, partially reversed by verapamil. Our data therefore support the use of skeletal muscle cells derived from USCs as an easily amenable tool to investigate Ca2+-homeostasis, in particular in those (neuro)muscular diseases that lack valid alternative models.

Abstract: Summary
The polarized flow of information through neural circuits depends on the orderly arrangement of neurons, their processes, and their synapses. This polarity emerges sequentially in development, starting with the directed migration of neuronal precursors, which subsequently elaborate neurites that form synapses in specific locations. In other organs, Fat cadherins sense the position and then polarize individual cells by inducing localized changes in the cytoskeleton that are coordinated across the tissue. Here, we show that the Fat-related protein Fat3 plays an analogous role during the assembly of polarized circuits in the murine retina. We find that the Fat3 intracellular domain (ICD) binds to cytoskeletal regulators and synaptic proteins, with discrete motifs required for amacrine cell migration and neurite retraction. Moreover, upon ICD deletion, extra neurites form but do not make ectopic synapses, suggesting that Fat3 independently regulates synapse localization. Thus, Fat3 serves as a molecular node to coordinate asymmetric cell behaviors across development.

Abstract: Summary
Leading CRISPR-Cas technologies employ Cas9 and Cas12 enzymes that generate RNA-guided dsDNA breaks. Yet, the most abundant microbial adaptive immune systems, Type I CRISPRs, are under-exploited for eukaryotic applications. Here, we report the adoption of a minimal CRISPR-Cas3 from Neisseria lactamica (Nla) type I-C system to create targeted large deletions in the human genome. RNP delivery of its processive Cas3 nuclease and target recognition complex Cascade can confer ∼95% editing efficiency. Unexpectedly, NlaCascade assembly in bacteria requires internal translation of a hidden component Cas11 from within the cas8 gene. Furthermore, expressing a separately encoded NlaCas11 is the key to enable plasmid- and mRNA-based editing in human cells. Finally, we demonstrate that supplying cas11 is a universal strategy to systematically implement divergent I-C, I-D, and I-B CRISPR-Cas3 editors with compact sizes, distinct PAM preferences, and guide orthogonality. These findings greatly expand our ability to engineer long-range genome edits.

Abstract: Summary
The postnatal development and maturation of the liver, the major metabolic organ, are inadequately understood. We have analyzed 52,834 single-cell transcriptomes and identified 31 cell types or states in mouse livers at postnatal days 1, 3, 7, 21, and 56. We observe unexpectedly high levels of hepatocyte heterogeneity in the developing liver and the progressive construction of the zonated metabolic functions from pericentral to periportal hepatocytes, which is orchestrated with the development of sinusoid endothelial, stellate, and Kupffer cells. Trajectory and gene regulatory analyses capture 36 transcription factors, including a circadian regulator, Bhlhe40, in programming liver development. Remarkably, we identified a special group of macrophages enriched at day 7 with a hybrid phenotype of macrophages and endothelial cells, which may regulate sinusoidal construction and Treg-cell function. This study provides a comprehensive atlas that covers all hepatic cell types and is instrumental for further dissection of liver development, metabolism, and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) arising as an intermediate of cellular processes on DNA is a potential vulnerability of the genome unless it is appropriately protected. Recent evidence suggests that R-loops, consisting of ssDNA and DNA-RNA hybrids, can form in the proximity of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within transcriptionally active regions. However, how the vulnerability of ssDNA in R-loops is overcome during DSB repair remains unclear. Here, we identify RAP80 as a factor suppressing the vulnerability of ssDNA in R-loops, chromosome translocations, and deletions during DSB repair. Mechanistically, RAP80 prevents unscheduled nucleolytic processing of ssDNA in R-loops by CtIP. This mechanism promotes efficient DSB repair via transcription-associated end joining dependent on BRCA1, Polθ, and LIG1/3. Thus, RAP80 suppresses the vulnerability of R-loops during DSB repair, thereby precluding genomic abnormalities in a critical component of the genome caused by deleterious R-loop processing.

Abstract: Summary
The cytoplasm is a crowded, visco-elastic environment whose physical properties change according to physiological or developmental states. How the physical properties of the cytoplasm impact cellular functions in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we probe the effects of cytoplasmic concentration on microtubules by applying osmotic shifts to fission yeast, moss, and mammalian cells. We show that the rates of both microtubule polymerization and depolymerization scale linearly and inversely with cytoplasmic concentration; an increase in cytoplasmic concentration decreases the rates of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization proportionally, whereas a decrease in cytoplasmic concentration leads to the opposite. Numerous lines of evidence indicate that these effects are due to changes in cytoplasmic viscosity rather than cellular stress responses or macromolecular crowding per se. We reconstituted these effects on microtubules in vitro by tuning viscosity. Our findings indicate that, even in normal conditions, the viscosity of the cytoplasm modulates the reactions that underlie microtubule dynamic behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Characteristics of the gut microbiome vary synchronously with changes in host diet. However, the underlying effects of these fluctuations remain unclear. Here, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) of diet-specific feces from an endangered mammal (the giant panda) into a germ-free mouse model. We demonstrated that the butyrate-producing bacterium Clostridium butyricum was more abundant during shoot-eating season than during the leaf-eating season, congruent with the significant increase in host body mass. Following season-specific FMT, the microbiota of the mouse model resembled that of the donor, and mice transplanted with the microbiota from the shoot-eating season grew faster and stored more fat. Mechanistic investigations revealed that butyrate extended the upregulation of hepatic circadian gene Per2, subsequently increasing phospholipid biosynthesis. Validation experiments further confirmed this causal relationship. This study demonstrated that seasonal shifts in the gut microbiome affect growth performance, facilitating a deeper understanding of host-microbe interactions in wild mammals.

Abstract: Summary
The meiosis-specific telomere-binding protein TERB1 anchors telomeres to the nuclear envelope and drives chromosome movements for the pairing of homologous chromosomes. TERB1 has an MYB-like DNA-binding (MYB) domain, which is a hallmark of telomeric DNA-binding proteins. Here, we demonstrate that the TERB1 MYB domain has lost its canonical DNA-binding activity. The analysis of Terb1 point mutant mice expressing TERB1 lacking its MYB domain showed that the MYB domain is dispensable for telomere localization of TERB1 and the downstream TERB2-MAJIN complex, the promotion of homologous pairing, and even fertility. Instead, the TERB1 MYB domain regulates the enrichment of cohesin and promotes the remodeling of axial elements in the early-to-late pachytene transition, which suppresses telomere erosion. Considering its conservation across metazoan phyla, the TERB1 MYB domain is likely to be important for the maintenance of telomeric DNA and thus for genomic integrity by suppressing meiotic telomere erosion over long evolutionary timescales.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic association studies for blood cell traits, which are key indicators of health and immune function, have identified several hundred associations and defined a complex polygenic architecture. Polygenic scores (PGSs) for blood cell traits have potential clinical utility in disease risk prediction and prevention, but designing PGS remains challenging and the optimal methods are unclear. To address this, we evaluated the relative performance of 6 methods to develop PGS for 26 blood cell traits, including a standard method of pruning and thresholding (P + T) and 5 learning methods: LDpred2, elastic net (EN), Bayesian ridge (BR), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN). We evaluated these optimized PGSs on blood cell trait data from UK Biobank and INTERVAL. We find that PGSs designed using common machine learning methods EN and BR show improved prediction of blood cell traits and consistently outperform other methods. Our analyses suggest EN/BR as the top choices for PGS construction, showing improved performance for 25 blood cell traits in the external validation, with correlations with the directly measured traits increasing by 10%–23%. Ten PGSs showed significant statistical interaction with sex, and sex-specific PGS stratification showed that all of them had substantial variation in the trajectories of blood cell traits with age. Genetic correlations between the PGSs for blood cell traits and common human diseases identified well-known as well as new associations. We develop machine learning-optimized PGS for blood cell traits, demonstrate their relationships with sex, age, and disease, and make these publicly available as a resource.

Abstract: The lysosome is an important membrane-bound acidic organelle that is regarded as the degradative center as well as multifunctional signaling hub. It digests unwanted macromolecules, damaged organelles, microbes, and other materials derived from endocytosis, autophagy, and phagocytosis. To function properly, the ionic homeostasis and membrane potential of the lysosome are strictly regulated by transporters and ion channels. As the most abundant cation inside the cell, potassium ions (K+) are vital for lysosomal membrane potential and lysosomal calcium (Ca2+) signaling. However, our understanding about how lysosomal K+homeostasis is regulated and what are the functions of K+in the lysosome is very limited. Currently, two lysosomal K+channels have been identified: large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+channel (BK) and transmembrane Protein 175 (TMEM175). In this review, we summarize recent development in our understanding of K+ homeostasis and K+channels in the lysosome. We hope to guide the readers into a more in-depth discussion of lysosomal K+ channels in lysosomal physiology and human diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Citrulline can be converted into argininosuccinate by argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) in the urea cycle and the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle. However, the regulation and biological function of citrulline metabolism remain obscure in the immune system. Unexpectedly, we found that macrophage citrulline declines rapidly after interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, which is required for efficient proinflammatory signaling activation. Mechanistically, IFN-γ and/or LPS stimulation promotes signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1)-mediated ASS1 transcription and Janus kinase2 (JAK2)-mediated phosphorylation of ASS1 at tyrosine 87, thereby leading to citrulline depletion. Reciprocally, increased citrulline directly binds to JAK2 and inhibits JAK2-STAT1 signaling. Blockage of ASS1-mediated citrulline depletion suppresses the host defense against bacterial infection in vivo. We therefore define a central role for ASS1 in controlling inflammatory macrophage activation and antibacterial defense through depletion of cellular citrulline and, further, identify citrulline as an innate immune-signaling metabolite that engages a metabolic checkpoint for proinflammatory responses.

Abstract: Summary
The symbiotic relationship between commensal microbes and host animals predicts unidentified beneficial impacts of individual bacterial metabolites on animal physiology. Peptidoglycan fragments (muropeptides) from the bacterial cell wall are known for their roles in pathogenicity and for inducing host immune responses. However, the potential beneficial usage of muropeptides from commensal bacteria by the host needs exploration. We identified a striking role for muropeptides in supporting mitochondrial homeostasis, development, and behaviors in Caenorhabditis elegans. We determined that the beneficial molecules are disaccharide muropeptides containing a short AA chain, and they enter intestinal-cell mitochondria to repress oxidative stress. Further analyses indicate that muropeptides execute this role by binding to and promoting the activity of ATP synthase. Therefore, given the exceptional structural conservation of ATP synthase, the role of muropeptides as a rare agonist of the ATP synthase presents a major conceptual modification regarding the impact of bacterial cell metabolites on animal physiology.

Here, we combined cell-type-resolved genomics and computational approaches to map crosstalk between hepatocytes and liver macrophages during fasting. We identified the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a key driver of fasting-induced reprogramming of the macrophage secretome including fasting-suppressed cytokines and showed that lack of macrophage GR impaired induction of ketogenesis during fasting as well as endotoxemia. Mechanistically, macrophage GR suppressed the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and promoted nuclear translocation of hepatocyte GR to activate a fat oxidation/ketogenesis-related gene program, cooperatively induced by GR and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) in hepatocytes. Together, our results demonstrate how resident liver macrophages directly influence ketogenesis in hepatocytes, thereby also outlining a strategy by which the immune system can set the metabolic tone during inflammatory disease and infection.
