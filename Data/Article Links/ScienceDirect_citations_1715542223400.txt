Abstract: Malignant glioma is an aggressive brain cancer that responds poorly to chemotherapy. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the development of chemoresistance in glioma is not well-understood. In this study, we show that long non-coding RNA AC023115.3 is induced by cisplatin in human glioblastoma cells and that elevated AC023115.3 promotes cisplatin-induced apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy. Further mechanistic studies revealed that AC023115.3 acts as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-26a and attenuates the inhibitory effect of miR-26a on GSK3β, a proline-directed serine-threonine kinase that promotes the degradation of Mcl1, leading to an increase in GSK3β and a decrease in autophagy. Additionally, we discovered that AC023115.3 improves chemosensitivity of glioma cells to cisplatin by regulating the miR-26a-GSK3β-Mcl1 pathway. Thus, these data indicate that the AC023115.3-miR-26a-GSK3β signalling axis plays an important role in reducing the chemoresistance of glioma.

Abstract: Recently, we have reported that the conditional mutant of the heat shock factor-1 (HSF1) in Candida albicans displays enhanced susceptibility not only towards a plant alkaloid, berberine, but also to diverse antifungal drugs. The present study attempts to identify additional phenotypes highlighting the non-heat shock responsive roles of HSF1 that could be correlated with the enhanced drug susceptibility. We uncover an intricate relationship between cellular iron and HSF1 mediated drug susceptibility of C. albicans. Interestingly, at 30°C, the conditional deletion of HSF1 while presented no growth defect, exhibited low intracellular iron. Notably, exogenous supplementation of iron reversed growth defects of HSF1 mutant when grown at 37°C. We provide evidence that the HSF1 mutant presents interesting phenotypes at basal conditions and are implicated in enhanced drug susceptibilities, dysfunctional mitochondria, decreased resistance towards oxidative stress and compromised cell wall integrity, all of which could be fully reversed upon iron supplementation. The HSF1 mutant also displayed defective filamentation at basal conditions under various solid hypha inducing media. Further, chelation of iron of HSF1 mutant cells led to severe growth defects and apparently triggers an iron starvation signal in the cell thus, demonstrating that HSF1 is essential for C. albicans cells to tolerate the iron deprivation stress. Together, apart from the well-established roles of HSF1 in reciprocation of thermal stress, this study extends its role under basal conditions and provides molecular insights into the role of HSF1 in iron deprivation and drug defense of C. albicans.

Abstract: The motility of cells plays an important role for many processes such as wound healing and malignant progression of cancer. The efficiency of cell motility is affected by the microenvironment. The connection between the cell and its microenvironment is facilitated by cell-matrix adhesion receptors and upon their activation focal adhesion proteins such as integrin-linked kinase (ILK) are recruited to sites of focal adhesion formation. In particular, ILK connects cell-matrix receptors to the actomyosin cytoskeleton. However, ILK's role in cell mechanics regulating cellular motility in 3D collagen matrices is still not well understood. We suggest that ILK facilitates 3D motility by regulating cellular mechanical properties such as stiffness and force transmission. Thus, ILK wild-type and knock-out cells are analyzed for their ability to migrate on 2D substrates serving as control and in dense 3D extracellular matrices. Indeed, ILK wild-type cells migrated faster on 2D substrates and migrated more numerous and deeper in 3D matrices. Hence, we analyzed cellular deformability, Young's modulus (stiffness) and adhesion forces. We found that ILK wild-type cells are less deformable (stiffer) and produce higher cell-matrix adhesion forces compared to ILK knock-out cells. Finally, ILK is essential for providing cellular mechanical stiffness regulating 3D motility.

Abstract: STIM1 is an endoplasmic reticulum calcium sensor that is involved in several processes in neurons, including store-operated calcium entry. STIM1 also inhibits voltage-gated calcium channels, such as Cav1.2 and Cav3.1, and is thus considered a multifunctional protein. The aim of this work was to investigate the ways in which transgenic neuronal overexpression of STIM1 in FVB/NJ mice affects animal behavior and the electrophysiological properties of neurons in acute hippocampal slices. We overexpressed STIM1 from the Thy1.2 promoter and verified neuronal expression by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Mature primary hippocampal cultures expressed STIM1 but exhibited no changes in calcium homeostasis. Basal synaptic transmission efficiency and short-term plasticity were comparable in slices that were isolated from transgenic mice, similarly as the magnitude of long-term potentiation. However, long-term depression that was induced by the glutamate receptor 1/5 agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine was impaired in STIM1 slices. Interestingly, transgenic mice exhibited a decrease in anxiety-like behavior and improvements in contextual learning. In summary, our data indicate that STIM1 overexpression in neurons in the brain perturbs metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling, leading to impairments in long-term depression and alterations in animal behavior.

Abstract: Interleukin-27 (IL27) is a type-I-cytokine of the IL6/IL12 family predominantly secreted by activated macrophages and dendritic cells. In the liver, IL27 expression was observed to be upregulated in patients with hepatitis B, and sera of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients contain significantly elevated levels of IL27 compared to healthy controls or patients with hepatitis and/or liver cirrhosis. In this study, we show that IL27 induces STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in 5 HCC lines and 3 different types of non-transformed liver cells. We were especially interested in the relevance of the IL27-induced STAT3 activation in liver cells. Thus, we compared the IL27 responses with those induced by IFNγ (STAT1-dominated response) or IL6-type cytokines (IL6, hyper-IL6 (hy-IL6) or OSM) (STAT3-dominated response) by microarray analysis and find that in HCC cells, IL27 induces an IFNγ-like, STAT1-dependent transcriptional response, but we do not find an effective STAT3-dependent response. Validation experiments corroborate the finding from the microarray evaluation. Interestingly, the availability of STAT1 seems critical in the shaping of the IL27 response, as the siRNA knock-down of STAT1 revealed the ability of IL27 to induce the acute-phase protein γ-fibrinogen, a typical IL6 family characteristic. Moreover, we describe a crosstalk between the signaling of IL6-type cytokines and IL27: responses to the gp130-engaging cytokine IL27 (but not those to IFNs) can be inhibited by IL6-type cytokine pre-stimulation, likely by a SOCS3-mediated mechanism. Thus, IL27 recapitulates IFNγ responses in liver cells, but differs from IFNγ by its sensitivity to SOCS3 inhibition.

Constitutive activation of T cells by γ2-herpesviral GPCR through the interaction with cellular CXCR4,

Abstract: Members of the herpesviral family use multiple strategies to hijack infected host cells and exploit cellular signaling for their pathogenesis and latent infection. Among the most intriguing weapons in the arsenal of pathogenic herpesviruses are the constitutively active virally-encoded G protein-coupled receptors (vGPCRs). Even though vGPCRs contribute to viral pathogenesis such as immune evasion and proliferative disorders, the molecular details of how vGPCRs continuously activate cellular signaling are largely unknown. Here, we report that the vGPCR of Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), an oncogenic γ2-herpesvirus, constitutively activates T cells via a heteromeric interaction with cellular CXCR4. Constitutive T cell activation also occurs with expression of the vGPCR of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), but not the vGPCR of Epstein-Barr virus. Expression of HVS vGPCR down-regulated the surface expression of CXCR4 but did not induce the degradation of the chemokine receptor, suggesting that vGPCR/CXCR4 signaling continues in cytosolic compartments. The physical association of vGPCR with CXCR4 was demonstrated by proximity ligation assay as well as immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, the constitutive activation of T cells by HVS vGPCR is independent of proximal T cell receptor (TCR) signaling molecules, such as TCRβ, Lck, and ZAP70, whereas CXCR4 silencing by shRNA abolished T cell activation by vGPCRs of HVS and KSHV. Furthermore, previously identified inactive vGPCR mutants failed to interact with CXCR4. These findings on the positive cooperativity of vGPCR with cellular CXCR4 in T cell activation extend our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of vGPCR function and highlight the importance of heteromerization for GPCR activity.

Abstract: Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) is a secretory protein that can be cleaved to form an N-terminal and a C-terminal protein. Studies performed thus far have linked ANGPTL4 to several cancer-related and metabolic processes. Notably, several point mutations in the C-terminal ANGPTL4 (cANGPTL4) have been reported, although no studies have been performed that ascribed these mutations to cancer-related and metabolic processes. In this study, we compared the characteristics of tumors with and without wild-type (wt) cANGPTL4 and tumors with cANGPTL4 bearing the T266M mutation (T266M cANGPTL4). We found that T266M cANGPTL4 bound to integrin α5β1 with a reduced affinity compared to wt, leading to weaker activation of downstream signaling molecules. The mutant tumors exhibited impaired proliferation, anoikis resistance, and migratory capability and had reduced adenylate energy charge. Further investigations also revealed that cANGPTL4 regulated the expression of Glut2. These findings may explain the differences in the tumor characteristics and energy metabolism observed with the cANGPTL4 T266M mutation compared to tumors without the mutation.

Abstract: Telomeres are specialized chromatin structures that prevent the degradation and instability of the ends of linear chromosomes. While telomerase maintains long stretches of the telomeric repeat, the majority of telomeric DNA is duplicated by conventional DNA replication. A fundamental step in eukaryotic DNA replication involves chromatin binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC). In human cells, telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) is thought to play a role in the recruitment of ORC onto telomeres. To better understand the mechanism of TRF2-mediated ORC recruitment, we utilized a lacO-LacI protein tethering system in U2OS cells and found that ectopically targeted TRF2, but not TRF1, can recruit ORC onto the lacO array. We further found that the TRF homology (TRFH) dimerization domain of TRF2, but not its mutant defective in dimerization, is sufficient for ORC and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) recruitment. Mutations impairing the dimerization also compromised ORC recruitment by full-length TRF2. Similar results were obtained using immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Together, these results suggest that dimerized TRF2 recruits ORC and stimulates pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation at telomeres through the TRFH domain.

Abstract: High intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause oxidative stress that results in numerous pathologies, including cell death. Transient potential receptor melastatin-2 (TRPM2), a Ca2+-permeable cation channel, is mainly activated by intracellular adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADPR) in response to oxidative stress. Here we studied the role and mechanisms of TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ influx on oxidative stress-induced cell death in cancer cells. We found that oxidative stress activated the TRPM2-Ca2+-CaMKII cascade to inhibit early autophagy induction, which ultimately led to cell death in TRPM2 expressing cancer cells. On the other hand, TRPM2 knockdown switched cells from cell death to autophagy for survival in response to oxidative stress. Moreover, we found that oxidative stress activated the TRPM2-CaMKII cascade to further induce intracellular ROS production, which led to mitochondria fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. In summary, our data demonstrated that oxidative stress activates the TRPM2-Ca2+-CaMKII-ROS signal loop to inhibit autophagy and induce cell death.

Abstract: Cell death depends on the balance between the activities of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) plays an important role in the cytoprotective process by inhibiting the caspase cascade and regulating pro-survival signaling pathways. While searching for novel interacting partners of XIAP, we identified Fas-associated factor 1 (FAF1). Contrary to XIAP, FAF1 is a pro-apoptotic factor that also regulates several signaling pathways in which XIAP is involved. However, the functional relationship between FAF1 and XIAP is unknown. Here, we describe a new interaction between XIAP and FAF1 and describe the functional implications of their opposing roles in cell death and NF-κB signaling. Our results clearly demonstrate the interaction of XIAP with FAF1 and define the specific region of the interaction. We observed that XIAP is able to block FAF1-mediated cell death by interfering with the caspase cascade and directly interferes in NF-κB pathway inhibition by FAF1. Furthermore, we show that XIAP promotes ubiquitination of FAF1. Conversely, FAF1 does not interfere with the anti-apoptotic activity of XIAP, despite binding to the BIR domains of XIAP; however, FAF1 does attenuate XIAP-mediated NF-κB activation. Altered expression of both factors has been implicated in degenerative and cancerous processes; therefore, studying the balance between XIAP and FAF1 in these pathologies will aid in the development of novel therapies.

Abstract: SLC35A4 has been classified in the SLC35A subfamily based on amino acid sequence homology. Most of the proteins belonging to the SLC35 family act as transporters of nucleotide sugars. In this study, the subcellular localization of endogenous SLC35A4 was determined via immunofluorescence staining, and it was demonstrated that SLC35A4 localizes mainly to the Golgi apparatus. In silico topology prediction suggests that SLC35A4 has an uneven number of transmembrane domains and its N-terminus is directed towards the Golgi lumen. However, an experimental assay refuted this prediction: SLC35A4 has an even number of transmembrane regions with both termini facing the cytosol. In vivo interaction analysis using the FLIM–FRET approach revealed that SLC35A4 neither forms homomers nor associates with other members of the SLC35A subfamily except SLC35A5. Additional assays demonstrated that endogenous SLC35A4 is 10 to 40nm proximal to SLC35A2 and SLC35A3. To determine SLC35A4 function SLC35A4 knock-out cells were generated with the CRISPR-Cas9 approach. Although no significant changes in glycosylation were observed, the introduced mutation influenced the subcellular distribution of the SLC35A2/SLC35A3 complexes. Additional FLIM–FRET experiments revealed that overexpression of SLC35A4-BFP together with SLC35A3 and the SLC35A2-Golgi splice variant negatively affects the interaction between the two latter proteins. The results presented here strongly indicate a modulatory role for SLC35A4 in intracellular trafficking of SLC35A2/SLC35A3 complexes.

Abstract: The molecular action of artemisinins (ARTs) is not well understood. To determine the molecular and cellular basis that might underlie their differential effects observed in anti-malarial and anti-cancer studies, we utilized the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to examine their toxicity profiles and properties. Previously we reported that while both low levels (2–8μM) of artemisinin (ART) and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) partly depolarize the mitochondrial membranes, inhibiting yeast growth on non-fermentable media, only DHA at moderate levels (such as 40μM) potently represses yeast growth on fermentable media via a heme-mediated pathway. Here we show that the lack of toxicity of ART even at high levels (200–400μM) on fermentable medium is due to the presence of Sod1. While we expected this normally Sod1-supressed action to be heme-mediated like DHA, surprisingly, this toxicity of ART is due to further depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. We also found that for DHA, the Sod1-suppressible anti-mitochondrial action is hidden by its heme-mediated cytotoxicity, and becomes readily noticeable only when the heme-mediated action is compromised and Sod1 is inactivated. Based on these findings, we propose that depending on the cell type and particular compound, ARTs work via one or more of the three types of activities: a Sod1-independent, partial mitochondria-depolarizing action; a Sod1-suppressible, more severe mitochondria-depolarizing action; and a heme-mediated general cytotoxicity. These action properties may underlie the disparities seen in the efficacy and toxicity of various ARTs, and additionally suggest it is important for researchers to clearly detail the particular compound when reporting on the effects of ARTs.

Abstract: In response to different adverse conditions, most eukaryotic organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, downregulate protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2α) by Gcn2, a highly conserved protein kinase. Gcn2 also controls the translation of Gcn4, a transcription factor involved in the induction of amino acid biosynthesis enzymes. Here, we have studied the functional role of Gcn2 and Gcn2-regulating proteins, in controlling translation during temperature downshifts of TRP1 and trp1 yeast cells. Our results suggest that neither cold-instigated amino acid limitation nor Gcn2 are involved in the translation suppression at low temperature. However, loss of TRP1 causes increased eIF2α phosphorylation, Gcn2-dependent polysome disassembly and overactivity of Gcn4, which result in cold-sensitivity. Indeed, knock-out of GCN2 improves cold growth of trp1 cells. Likewise, mutation of several Gcn2-regulators and effectors results in cold-growth effects. Remarkably, we found that Hog1, the osmoresponsive MAPK, plays a role in the regulatory mechanism of Gcn2-eIF2α. Finally, we demonstrated that P-body formation responds to a downshift in temperature in a TRP1-dependent manner and is required for cold tolerance.

Abstract: Neural crest cells are multipotent progenitors that migrate extensively and differentiate into numerous derivatives. The developmental plasticity and migratory ability of neural crest cells render them an attractive model for studying numerous aspects of cell progression. We observed that zebrafish rgs2 was expressed in neural crest cells. Disrupting Rgs2 expression by using a dominant negative rgs2 construct or rgs2 morpholinos reduced GTPase-activating protein activity, induced the formation of neural crest progenitors, increased the proliferation of nonectomesenchymal neural crest cells, and inhibited the formation of ectomesenchymal neural crest derivatives. The transcription of pparda (which encodes Pparδ, a Wnt-activated transcription factor) was upregulated in Rgs2-deficient embryos, and Pparδ inhibition using a selective antagonist in the Rgs2-deficient embryos repaired neural crest defects. Our results clarify the mechanism through which the Rgs2–Pparδ cascade regulates neural crest development; specifically, Pparδ directly binds to the promoter and upregulates the transcription of the neural crest specifier sox10. This study reveals a unique regulatory mechanism, the Rgs2–Pparδ–Sox10 signaling cascade, and defines a key molecular regulator, Rgs2, in neural crest development.

Abstract: Posttranslational modifications of certain stress granule (SG) proteins are closely related to the assembly of SGs, a type of cytoplasmic foci structure. Our previous studies revealed that the Tudor staphylococcal nuclease (Tudor-SN) protein participates in the formation of SGs. However, the functional significance of potential Tudor-SN modifications during stress has not been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that the Tudor-SN protein was phosphorylated at threonine 103 (T103) upon stimulation with arsenite. In addition, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was found to be responsible for Tudor-SN phosphorylation at the T103 site. We further illustrated that either a T103A mutation or the suppression of phosphorylation of T103 by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 inhibited the efficient recruitment of Tudor-SN into SGs. In addition, the T103A mutation could affect the physical binding of Tudor-SN with the G3BP (Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding protein) protein but not with the HuR (Hu antigen R) protein and AGTR1-3′UTR (3′-untranslated region of angiotensin II receptor, type 1) mRNA cargo. These data suggested that JNK-enhanced Tudor-SN phosphorylation promotes the interaction between Tudor-SN and G3BP and facilitates the efficient recruitment of Tudor-SN into SGs under conditions of sodium arsenite-induced oxidative stress. This finding provides novel insights into the physiological function of Tudor-SN modification.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the deadliest cancers. From a clinical view, the transcription factor NF-κB is of particular importance, since this pathway confers apoptosis resistance and limits drug efficacy. Whereas the role of the most abundant NF-κB subunit p65/RelA in therapeutic resistance is well documented, only little knowledge of the RelA downstream targets and their functional relevance in TRAIL mediated apoptosis in PDAC is available. In the present study TRAIL resistant and sensitive PDAC cell lines were analyzed for differentially expressed RelA target genes, to define RelA downstream targets mediating TRAIL resistance. The most upregulated target gene was then further functionally characterized. Unbiased genome-wide expression analysis demonstrated that the chemokine CCL20 represents the strongest TRAIL inducible direct RelA target gene in resistant PDAC cells. Unexpectedly, targeting CCL20 by siRNA, blocking antibodies or by downregulation of the sole CCL20 receptor CCR6 had no effect on PDAC cell death or cancer cell migration, arguing against an autocrine role of CCL20 in PDAC. However, by using an ex vivo indirect co-culture system we were able to show that CCL20 acts paracrine to recruit immune cells. Importantly, CCL20-recruited immune cells further increase TRAIL resistance of CCL20-producing PDAC cells. In conclusion, our data show a functional role of a RelA-CCL20 pathway in PDAC TRAIL resistance. We demonstrate how the therapy-induced cross-talk of cancer cells with immune cells affects treatment responses, knowledge needed to tailor novel bi-specific treatments, which target tumor cell as well as immune cells.

Abstract: Leishmaniasis is a spectrum of diseases caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania that affects millions of people around the world. During infection, the parasites use different strategies to survive the host's defenses, including overcoming exposure to reactive oxidant species (ROS), responsible for causing damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. This damage especially affects telomeres, which frequently results in genome instability, senescence and cell death. Telomeres are the physical ends of the chromosomes composed of repetitive DNA coupled with proteins, whose function is to protect the chromosomes termini and avoid end-fusion and nucleolytic degradation. In this work, we induced acute oxidative stress in promastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis by treating parasites with 2mM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 1h, which was able to increase intracellular ROS levels. In addition, oxidative stress induced DNA damage, as confirmed by 8-oxodGuo quantification and TUNEL assays and the dissociation of LaRPA-1 from the 3′ G-overhang, leading to telomere shortening. Moreover, LaRPA-1 was observed to interact with newly formed C-rich single-stranded telomeric DNA, probably as a consequence of the DNA damage response. Nonetheless, acute oxidative stress caused the death of some of the L. amazonensis population and induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in survivor parasites, which were able to continue proliferating and replicating DNA and became more resistant to oxidative stress. Taken together, these results suggest that adaptation occurs through the selection of the fittest parasites in terms of repairing oxidative DNA damage at telomeres and maintaining genome stability in a stressful environment.

Abstract: The dynamic properties of the actin cytoskeleton in smooth muscle cells play an important role in a number of cardiovascular disease states. The state of actin does not only mediate mechanical stability and contractile function but can also regulate gene expression via myocardin related transcription factors (MRTFs). These transcriptional co-activators regulate genes encoding contractile and cytoskeletal proteins in smooth muscle. Regulation of small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) by actin polymerization may mediate some of these effects. MiRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression by post-transcriptional regulation of target messenger RNA. In this study we aimed to determine a profile of miRNAs that were 1) regulated by actin/MRTF-A, 2) associated with the contractile smooth muscle phenotype and 3) enriched in muscle cells. This analysis was performed using cardiovascular disease-focused miRNA arrays in both mouse and human cells. The potential clinical importance of actin polymerization in aortic aneurysm was evaluated using biopsies from mildly dilated human thoracic aorta in patients with stenotic tricuspid or bicuspid aortic valve. By integrating information from multiple qPCR based miRNA arrays we identified a group of five miRNAs (miR-1, miR-22, miR-143, miR-145 and miR-378a) that were sensitive to actin polymerization and MRTF-A overexpression in both mouse and human vascular smooth muscle. With the exception of miR-22, these miRNAs were also relatively enriched in striated and/or smooth muscle containing tissues. Actin polymerization was found to be dramatically reduced in the aorta from patients with mild aortic dilations. This was associated with a decrease in actin/MRTF-regulated miRNAs. In conclusion, the transcriptional co-activator MRTF-A and actin polymerization regulated a subset of miRNAs in vascular smooth muscle. Identification of novel miRNAs regulated by actin/MRTF-A may provide further insight into the mechanisms underlying vascular disease states, such as aortic aneurysm, as well as novel ideas regarding therapeutic strategies.

Synthetic triterpenoids inhibit GSK3β activity and localization and affect focal adhesions and cell migration,

Abstract: Synthetic triterpenoids are a class of anti-cancer compounds that target many cellular functions, including apoptosis and cell growth in both cell culture and animal models. We have shown that triterpenoids inhibit cell migration in part by interfering with Arp2/3-dependent branched actin polymerization in lamellipodia (To et al., 2010). Our current studies reveal that Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), a kinase that regulates many cellular processes, including cell adhesion dynamics, is a triterpenoid-binding protein. Furthermore, triterpenoids were observed to inhibit GSK3β activity and increase cellular focal adhesion size. To further examine whether these effects on focal adhesions in triterpenoid-treated cells were GSK3β-dependent, GSK3β inhibitors (lithium chloride and SB216763) were used to examine cell adhesion and morphology as well as cell migration. Our results showed that GSK3β inhibitors also altered cell adhesion sizes. Moreover, these inhibitors blocked cell migration and displaced proteins at the leading edge of migrating cells, consistent with what was observed in triterpenoid-treated cells. Therefore, the triterpenoids may affect cell migration via a mechanism that targets and alters the activity and localization of GSK3β.

Abstract: Tumor cells dependence on glutamine offers a rationale for their elimination via targeting of glutamine metabolism. The aim of this work was to investigate how glutamine deprivation affects the cellular response to conventionally used anticancer drugs. To answer this question, neuroblastoma cells were pre-incubated in a glutamine-free medium and treated with cisplatin or etoposide. Obtained results revealed that glutamine withdrawal affected cellular response to therapeutic drugs in a different manner. Glutamine deprivation suppressed etoposide-induced, but markedly stimulated cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Suppression of etoposide-induced cell death correlated with a downregulation of p53 expression, which, among other functions, regulates the expression of death receptor 5, one of the activators of caspase-8. In contrast, stimulation of cisplatin-induced cell death involved reactive oxygen species-mediated downregulation of FLIP-S, an inhibitor of caspase-8. As a result, the activity of caspase-8 was stimulated causing cleavage of the pro-apoptotic protein Bid, which is involved in the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and the release of pro-apoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c from mitochondria. Thus, suppression of glutamine metabolism can sensitize tumor cells to treatment and could be utilized for anti-cancer therapy. However, it should be done cautiously, since adverse effects may occur when combined with an inappropriate therapeutic drug.

The peroxisomal import receptor PEX5 functions as a stress sensor, retaining catalase in the cytosol in times of oxidative stress,

Abstract: Accumulating evidence indicates that peroxisome functioning, catalase localization, and cellular oxidative balance are intimately interconnected. Nevertheless, it remains largely unclear why modest increases in the cellular redox state especially interfere with the subcellular localization of catalase, the most abundant peroxisomal antioxidant enzyme. This study aimed at gaining more insight into this phenomenon. Therefore, we first established a simple and powerful approach to study peroxisomal protein import and protein-protein interactions in living cells in response to changes in redox state. By employing this approach, we confirm and extend previous observations that Cys-11 of human PEX5, the shuttling import receptor for peroxisomal matrix proteins containing a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1), functions as a redox switch that modulates the protein's activity in response to intracellular oxidative stress. In addition, we show that oxidative stress affects the import of catalase, a non-canonical PTS1-containing protein, more than the import of a reporter protein containing a canonical PTS1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that changes in the local redox state do not affect PEX5-substrate binding and that human PEX5 does not oligomerize in cellulo, not even when the cells are exposed to oxidative stress. Finally, we present evidence that catalase retained in the cytosol can protect against H2O2-mediated redox changes in a manner that peroxisomally targeted catalase does not. Together, these findings lend credit to the idea that inefficient catalase import, when coupled with the role of PEX5 as a redox-regulated import receptor, constitutes a cellular defense mechanism to combat oxidative insults of extra-peroxisomal origin.

Abstract: Yeast cell wall contains a number of proteins that are either non-covalently (Scw-proteins), or covalently (Ccw-proteins) bound to β-1,3-glucan, the latter either through GPI-anchors and β-1,6-glucan, or by alkali labile ester linkages between γ-carboxyl groups of glutamic acid and hydroxyl groups of glucoses (Pir-proteins). It was shown that a part of Scw4, previously identified among the non-covalently bound cell wall proteins, was covalently attached to wall polysaccharides by a so far unknown alkali sensitive linkage. Thus Scw4 could be released from cell walls by treatments with hot SDS, mild alkali, or β-1,3-glucanases, respectively. It was further shown that non-covalently bound Scw4 (SDS released) underwent the Kex2 proteolytic processing. In this paper it was demonstrated that Scw4 was also processed by yapsins at a position 9 amino acids downstream of the Kex2 cleavage site. Scw4 cleaved at the yapsin site had a markedly lower potential for covalent attachment to glucan. The overproduction of the fully processed form of Scw4 lead to high mortality, particularly in the stationary phase of growth, and to markedly increased cell size. On the other hand, the overproduction of Scw4 processed only by Kex2 or not processed at all had no apparent change in mortality indicating that only the smallest, completely mature form of Scw4 had the activity leading to observed phenotype changes.

Abstract: Maspin is a non-inhibitory member of the serpin family that affects cell behaviours related to migration and survival. We have previously shown that peptides of the isolated G α-helix (G-helix) domain of maspin show bioactivity. Migration, invasion, adhesion and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are important processes that contribute to the build-up of atherosclerotic plaques. Here we report the use of functional assays of these behaviours to investigate whether other maspin-derived peptides impact directly on VSMC; focusing on potential anti-atherogenic properties. We designed 18 new peptides from the structural moieties of maspin above ten amino acid residues in length and considered them beside the existing G-helix peptides. Of the novel peptides screened those with the sequences of maspin strand 4 and 5 of beta sheet B (S4B and S5B) reduced VSMC migration, invasion and proliferation, as well as increasing cell adhesion. A longer peptide combining these consecutive sequences showed a potentiation of responses, and a 7-mer contained all essential elements for functionality. This is the first time that these parts of maspin have been highlighted as having key roles affecting cell function. We present evidence for a mechanism whereby S4B and S5B act through ERK1/2 and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to influence VSMC responses.

Abstract: Despite existing knowledge about the role of the A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) as the α-secretase involved in the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch signalling we have only limited information about its regulation. In this study, we have identified ADAM10 interactors using a split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid approach. Tetraspanin 3 (Tspan3), which is highly expressed in the murine brain and elevated in brains of Alzheimer´s disease (AD) patients, was identified and confirmed to bind ADAM10 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells in complex with APP and the γ-secretase protease presenilin. Tspan3 expression increased the cell surface levels of its interacting partners and was mainly localized in early and late endosomes. In contrast to the previously described ADAM10-binding tetraspanins, Tspan3 did not affect the endoplasmic reticulum to plasma membrane transport of ADAM10. Heterologous Tspan3 expression significantly increased the appearance of carboxy-terminal cleavage products of ADAM10 and APP, whereas N-cadherin ectodomain shedding appeared unaffected. Inhibiting the endocytosis of Tspan3 by mutating a critical cytoplasmic tyrosine-based internalization motif led to increased surface expression of APP and ADAM10. After its downregulation in neuroblastoma cells and in brains of Tspan3-deficient mice, ADAM10 and APP levels appeared unaltered possibly due to a compensatory increase in the expression of Tspans 5 and 7, respectively. In conclusion, our data suggest that Tspan3 acts in concert with other tetraspanins as a stabilizing factor of active ADAM10, APP and the γ-secretase complex at the plasma membrane and within the endocytic pathway.

Abstract: During starvation, intra-mitochondrial sirtuins, NAD+ sensitive deacylating enzymes that modulate metabolic homeostasis and survival, directly adjust mitochondrial function to nutrient availability; concomitantly, mitochondria elongate to escape autophagic degradation. However, whether sirtuins also impinge on mitochondrial dynamics is still uncharacterized. Here we show that the mitochondrial Sirtuin 5 (Sirt5) is essential for starvation induced mitochondrial elongation. Deletion of Sirt5 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts increased levels of mitochondrial dynamics of 51kDa protein and mitochondrial fission protein 1, leading to mitochondrial accumulation of the pro-fission dynamin related protein 1 and to mitochondrial fragmentation. During starvation, Sirt5 deletion blunted mitochondrial elongation, resulting in increased mitophagy. Our results indicate that starvation induced mitochondrial elongation and evasion from autophagic degradation requires the energy sensor Sirt5.

Abstract: If no fertilization occurs for a prolonged time following ovulation, oocytes experience a time-dependent deterioration in quality both in vivo and in vitro due to processes called postovulatory aging. Because the postovulatory aging of oocytes has marked detrimental effects on embryo development and offspring, many efforts have been made to unveil the underlying mechanisms. Here we showed that translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) regulates spindle assembly during postovulatory aging and prevents deterioration in mouse oocyte quality. Spindle dynamics decreased with reduced TCTP level during aging of mouse oocytes. Knockdown of TCTP accelerated the reduction of spindle dynamics, accompanying with aging-related deterioration of oocyte quality. Conversely, overexpression of TCTP prevented aging-associated decline of spindle dynamics. Moreover, the aging-related abnormalities in oocytes were rescued after TCTP overexpression, thereby improving fertilization competency and subsequent embryo development. Therefore, our results demonstrate that TCTP-mediated spindle dynamics play a key role in maintaining oocyte quality during postovulatory aging and overexpression of TCTP is sufficient to prevent aging-associated abnormalities in mouse oocytes.

Abstract: The robust regenerative capacity of planarian flatworms depends on the orchestration of signaling events from early wounding responses through the stem cell enacted differentiative outcomes that restore appropriate tissue types. Acute signaling events in excitable cells play an important role in determining regenerative polarity, rationalized by the discovery that sub-epidermal muscle cells express critical patterning genes known to control regenerative outcomes. These data imply a dual conductive (neuromuscular signaling) and instructive (anterior-posterior patterning) role for Ca2+ signaling in planarian regeneration. Here, to facilitate study of acute signaling events in the excitable cell niche, we provide a de novo transcriptome assembly from the planarian Dugesia japonica allowing characterization of the diverse ionotropic portfolio of this model organism. We demonstrate the utility of this resource by proceeding to characterize the individual role of each of the planarian voltage-operated Ca2+ channels during regeneration, and demonstrate that knockdown of a specific voltage operated Ca2+ channel (Cav1B) that impairs muscle function uniquely creates an environment permissive for anteriorization. Provision of the full transcriptomic dataset should facilitate further investigations of molecules within the planarian voltage-gated channel portfolio to explore the role of excitable cell physiology on regenerative outcomes.

Abstract: Non-dividing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures are highly relevant for fundamental and applied studies. However, cultivation conditions in which non-dividing cells retain substantial metabolic activity are lacking. Unlike stationary-phase (SP) batch cultures, the current experimental paradigm for non-dividing yeast cultures, cultivation under extreme calorie restriction (ECR) in retentostat enables non-dividing yeast cells to retain substantial metabolic activity and to prevent rapid cellular deterioration. Distribution of F-actin structures and single-cell copy numbers of specific transcripts revealed that cultivation under ECR yields highly homogeneous cultures, in contrast to SP cultures that differentiate into quiescent and non-quiescent subpopulations. Combined with previous physiological studies, these results indicate that yeast cells subjected to ECR survive in an extended G1 phase. This study demonstrates that yeast cells exposed to ECR differ from carbon-starved cells and offer a promising experimental model for studying non-dividing, metabolically active, and robust eukaryotic cells.

Abstract: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for steroid hormones mediate unconventional steroid signaling and play a significant role in the rapid actions of steroids in a variety of biological processes, including those in the nervous system. However, the effects of these GPCRs on overall neuronal activity remain largely elusive. Drosophila DopEcR is a GPCR that responds to both ecdysone (the major steroid hormone in insects) and dopamine, regulating multiple second messenger systems. Recent studies have revealed that DopEcR is preferentially expressed in the nervous system and involved in behavioral regulation. Here we utilized the bioluminescent Ca2+-indicator GFP-aequorin to monitor the nicotine-induced Ca2+-response within the mushroom bodies (MB), a higher-order brain center in flies, and examined how DopEcR modulates these Ca2+-dynamics. Our results show that in DopEcR knockdown flies, the nicotine-induced Ca2+-response in the MB was significantly enhanced selectively in the medial lobes. We then reveal that application of DopEcR's ligands, ecdysone and dopamine, had different effects on nicotine-induced Ca2+-responses in the MB: ecdysone enhanced activity in the calyx and cell body region in a DopEcR-dependent manner, whereas dopamine reduced activity in the medial lobes independently of DopEcR. Finally, we show that flies with reduced DopEcR function in the MB display decreased locomotor activity. This behavioral phenotype of DopEcR-deficient flies may be partly due to their enhanced MB activity, since the MB have been implicated in the suppression of locomotor activity. Overall, these data suggest that DopEcR is involved in region-specific modulation of Ca2+ dynamics within the MB, which may play a role in behavioral modulation.

Abstract: Two key proteins for cellular communication between astrocytes and neurons are αvβ3 integrin and the receptor Thy-1. Binding of these molecules in the same (cis) or on adjacent (trans) cellular membranes induces Thy-1 clustering, triggering actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Molecular events that could explain how the Thy-1-αvβ3 integrin interaction signals have only been studied separately in different cell types, and the detailed transcellular communication and signal transduction pathways involved in neuronal cytoskeleton remodeling remain unresolved. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, single-molecule tracking, and high-resolution nanoscopy, we provide evidence that upon binding to αvβ3 integrin, Thy-1 mobility decreased while Thy-1 nanocluster size increased. This occurred concomitantly with inactivation and exclusion of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src from the Thy-1/C-terminal Src kinase (Csk)-binding protein (CBP)/Csk complex. The Src inactivation decreased the p190Rho GTPase activating protein phosphorylation, promoting RhoA activation, cofilin, and myosin light chain II phosphorylation and, consequently, neurite shortening. Finally, silencing the adaptor CBP demonstrated that this protein was a key transducer in the Thy-1 signaling cascade. In conclusion, these data support the hypothesis that the Thy-1-CBP-Csk-Src-RhoA-ROCK axis transmitted signals from astrocytic integrin-engaged Thy-1 (trans) to the neuronal actin cytoskeleton. Importantly, the β3 integrin in neurons (cis) was not found to be crucial for neurite shortening. This is the first study to detail the signaling pathway triggered by αvβ3, the endogenous Thy-1 ligand, highlighting the role of membrane-bound integrins as trans acting ligands in astrocyte-neuron communication.

Abstract: Cells sense and respond to the biophysical properties of their surrounding environment by interacting with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Therefore, the optimization of these cell–matrix interactions is critical in tissue engineering. The vascular system is adapted to specific functions in diverse tissues and organs. Appropriate arterial-venous differentiation is vital for the establishment of functional vasculature in angiogenesis. Here, we have developed a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based substrate capable of simulating the physiologically relevant stiffness of both venous (7kPa) and arterial (128kPa) tissues. This substrate was utilized to investigate the effects of changes in substrate stiffness on the differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). As EPCs derived from mouse bone marrow were cultured on substrates of increasing stiffness, the mRNA and protein levels of the specific arterial endothelial cell marker ephrinB2 were found to increase, while the expression of the venous marker EphB4 decreased. Further experiments were performed to identify the mechanotransduction pathway involved in this process. The results indicated that substrate stiffness regulates the arterial and venous differentiation of EPCs via the Ras/Mek pathway. This work shows that modification of substrate stiffness may represent a method for regulating arterial-venous differentiation for the fulfilment of diverse functions of the vasculature.

Abstract: Hearing loss affects millions of people in the world. In mammals the auditory system comprises diverse cell types which are terminally differentiated and with no regenerative potential. There is a tremendous research interest aimed at identifying cell therapy based solutions or pharmacological approaches that could be applied therapeutically alongside auditory devices to prevent hair cell and neuron loss. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a pleiotropic bioactive sphingolipid that plays key role in the regulation of many physiological and pathological functions. S1P is intracellularly produced by sphingosine kinase (SK) 1 and SK2 and exerts many of its action consequently to its ligation to S1P specific receptors (S1PR), S1P1–5. In this study, murine auditory neuroblasts named US/VOT-N33 have been used as progenitors of neurons of the spiral ganglion. We demonstrated that the fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)-induced proliferative action was dependent on SK1, SK2 as well as S1P1 and S1P2. Moreover, the pro-survival effect of FGF2 from apoptotic cell death induced by staurosporine treatment was dependent on SK but not on S1PR. Additionally, ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways were found to mediate the mitogenic and survival action of FGF2, respectively. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a crucial role for S1P signaling axis in the proliferation and the survival of otic vesicle neuroprogenitors, highlighting the identification of possible novel therapeutical approaches to prevent neuronal degeneration during hearing loss.

Abstract: Mitochondria, responding to a wide variety of signals, including oxidative stress, are critical in regulating apoptosis that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. A number of mitochondrial proteins and pathways have been found to be involved in the mitochondrial dependent apoptosis mechanism, such as optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), deacetylase enzyme and cAMP signal. In the present work we report a network among OPA1, Sirt3 and cAMP in ROS-dependent apoptosis. Rat myoblastic H9c2 cell lines, were treated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) to induce oxidative stress-dependent apoptosis. FRET analysis revealed a selective decrease of mitochondrial cAMP in response to t-BHP treatment. This was associated with a decrease of Sirt3 protein level and proteolytic processing of OPA1. Pretreatment of cells with permeant analogous of cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) protected the cell from apoptosis preventing all these events. Using H89, inhibitor of the protein kinase A (PKA), and protease inhibitors, evidences have been obtained that ROS-dependent apoptosis is associated with an alteration of mitochondrial cAMP/PKA signal that causes degradation/proteolysis of Sirt3 that, in turn, promotes acetylation and proteolytic processing of OPA1.

Abstract: Abnormal expression of claudin (CLDN) subtypes has been reported in various solid cancers. However, it is unknown which subtype plays a key role in the regulation of proliferation in cancer cells. The expression of CLDN3-5, 7, and 18 in human lung squamous carcinoma tissues was lower than that in normal tissue. Here, we examined which combination of exogenous CLDNs expression inhibits proliferation and the molecular mechanism using human lung squamous RERF-LC-AI cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting showed that CLDN3-5, 7, and 18 are little expressed in RERF-LC-AI cells. In the exogenously transfected cells, CLDN5, 7, and 18 were distributed in the cell–cell contact areas concomitant with ZO-1, a tight junctional scaffolding protein, whereas CLDN3 and 4 were not. Cell proliferation was individually and additively suppressed by CLDN5, 7, and 18. The expression of these CLDNs showed no cytotoxicity compared with mock cells. CLDN5, 7, and 18 increased p21 and decreased cyclin D1, resulting in the suppression of cell cycle G1-S transition. The expression of these CLDNs inhibited phosphorylation of Akt without affecting phosphorylated ERK1/2. Furthermore, these CLDNs inhibited the nuclear localization of Akt and its association with 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). The suppression of G1-S transition caused by CLDN5, 7, and 18 was rescued by the expression of constitutively active-Akt. We suggest that the reduction of CLDN5, 7, and 18 expression loses the suppressive ability of interaction between PDK1 and Akt and causes sustained phosphorylation of Akt, resulting in the disordered proliferation in lung squamous carcinoma cells.

Abstract: A complex cascade of molecular events occurs in apoptotic cells but cell-to-cell variability significantly complicates determination of the order and interconnections between different processes. For better understanding of the mechanisms of programmed cell death, dynamic simultaneous registration of several parameters is required. In this paper we used multiparameter fluorescence microscopy to analyze energy metabolism, intracellular pH and caspase-3 activation in living cancer cells in vitro during staurosporine-induced apoptosis. We performed metabolic imaging of two co-factors, NAD(P)H and FAD, and used the genetically encoded pH-indicator SypHer1 and the FRET-based sensor for caspase-3 activity, mKate2-DEVD-iRFP, to visualize these parameters by confocal fluorescence microscopy and two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. The correlation between energy metabolism, intracellular pH and caspase-3 activation and their dynamic changes were studied in CT26 cancer cells during apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis was accompanied by a switch to oxidative phosphorylation, cytosol acidification and caspase-3 activation. We showed that alterations in cytosolic pH and the activation of oxidative phosphorylation are relatively early events associated with the induction of apoptosis.

Abstract: Aging affects numerous aspects of cell biology, but the senescence-associated changes in the stress response are only beginning to emerge. To obtain mechanistic insights into these events, we examined the formation of canonical and non-canonical stress granules (SGs) in the cytoplasm. SG generation is a key event after exposure to physiological or environmental stressors. It requires the SG-nucleating proteins G3BP1 and TIA-1/TIAR and stress-related signaling events. To analyze SG formation, we used two independent models of somatic cell aging. In both model systems, cellular senescence impaired the assembly of two SG classes: (i) it compromised the formation of canonical SGs, and (ii) skewed the production of non-canonical SGs. We dissected the mechanisms underlying these senescence-dependent changes in granule biogenesis and identified several specific targets that were modulated by aging. Thus, we demonstrate a depletion of G3BP1 and TIA-1/TIAR in senescent cells and show that the loss of G3BP1 contributed to impaired SG formation. We further reveal that aging reduced Sp1 levels; this transcription factor regulated G3BP1 and TIA-1/TIAR abundance. The assembly of canonical SGs relies on the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2α. We show that senescence can cause eIF2α hyperphosphorylation. CReP is a subunit of protein phosphatase 1 and critical to reverse the stress-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α. We demonstrate that the loss of CReP correlated with the aging-related hyperphosphorylation of eIF2α. Together, we have identified significant changes in the stress response of aging cells and provide mechanistic insights. Based on our work, we propose that the decline in SG formation can provide a new biomarker to evaluate cellular aging.

Abstract: Biliproteins have extended the spectral range of fluorescent proteins into the region of maximal transmission of most tissues and are favorable for multiplexing, but their application presents considerable challenges. Their fluorescence derives from open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophores which often require the introduction of dedicated reductases and lyases. In addition, their fluorescence yield generally decreases with increasing wavelengths and depends strongly on the state of the binding protein. We report fluorescent biliproteins, termed BDFPs, that are derived from the phycobilisome core subunit, ApcF2: this subunit is induced in the thermophilic cyanobacterium, Chroococcidiopsis thermalis, by far-red light and binds phycocyanobilin non-covalently. The BDFPs obtained by molecular evolution of ApcF2 bind the more readily accessible biliverdin covalently while retaining the red-shifted fluorescence in the near-infrared spectral region (~710nm). They are small monomers (~15kDa) and not only show excellent photostability, but are also thermostable up to 80°C, tolerate acid down to pH2 and high concentrations of denaturants. The result indicates far-red adapting cyanobacteria as a useful source for designing extremely red-shifted fluorescent markers. In vivo performance of BDFPs as biomarkers in conventional and super-resolution microscopy, alone or fused to target proteins, is exemplified in several mammalian cells, including, human cell lines, in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans and, at low pH, in Lactobacillus lactis.

Abstract: Ca2+ signaling is a major signal transduction pathway involved in T cell activation, but also in apoptosis of T cells. Since T cells make use of several Ca2+-mobilizing second messengers, such as nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate, d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and cyclic ADP-ribose, we intended to analyze luminal Ca2+ concentration upon cell activation. Mag-Fluo4/AM, a low-affinity Ca2+ dye known to localize to the endoplasmic reticular lumen in many cell types, showed superior brightness and bleaching stability, but, surprisingly, co-localized with mito-tracker, but not with ER-tracker in Jurkat T cells. Thus, we used Mag-Fluo4/AM to monitor the free luminal mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]mito) in these cells. Simultaneous analysis of the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and [Ca2+]mito upon cell stimulation revealed that Ca2+ signals in the majority of mitochondria were initiated at [Ca2+ ]i≥approx. 400 to 550nM. In primary murine CD4+ T cells, Mag-Fluo4 showed two different localization patterns: either co-localization with mito-tracker, as in Jurkat T cells, or with ER-tracker. Thus, in single primary murine CD4+ T cells, either decreases of [Ca2+ ]ER or increases of [Ca2+ ]mito were observed upon cell stimulation.

Abstract: Glioblastomas are the deadliest type of brain cancer and are frequently associated with poor prognosis and a high degree of recurrence despite removal by surgical resection and treatment by chemo- and radio-therapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment well known to induce mainly necrotic and apoptotic cell death in solid tumors. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-based PDT was recently shown to sensitize human glioblastoma cells (LN-18) to a RIP3 (Receptor Interacting Protein 3)-dependent cell death which is counter-acted by activation of autophagy. These promising results led us to investigate the pathways involved in cell death and survival mechanisms occurring in glioblastoma following PDT. In the present study, we describe a new TSC2 (Tuberous Sclerosis 2)-dependent survival pathway implicating MK2 (MAPKAPK2) kinase and 14-3-3 proteins which conducts to the activation of a pro-survival autophagy. Moreover, we characterized a new RIP3/TSC2 complex where RIP3 is suggested to promote cell death by targeting TSC2-dependent survival pathway. These results highlight (i) a new role of TSC2 to protect glioblastoma against PDT-induced cell death and (ii) TSC2 and 14-3-3 as new RIP3 partners.

Abstract: The disruption of Ca2+ signaling in neurons, together with a failure to keep optimal intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, have been proposed as significant factors for neuronal dysfunction in the Ca2+ hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau is a protein that plays an essential role in axonal transport and can form abnormal structures such as neurofibrillary tangles that constitute one of the hallmarks of AD. We have recently shown that plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), a key enzyme in the maintenance of optimal cytosolic Ca2+ levels in cells, is inhibited by tau in membrane vesicles. In the present study we show that tau inhibits synaptosomal PMCA purified from pig cerebrum, and reconstituted in phosphatidylserine-containing lipid bilayers, with a Ki value of 1.5±0.2nM tau. Noteworthy, the inhibitory effect of tau is dependent on the charge of the phospholipid used for PMCA reconstitution. In addition, nanomolar concentrations of calmodulin, the major endogenous activator of PMCA, protects against inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase activity by tau. Our results in a cellular model such as SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells yielded an inhibition of PMCA by nanomolar tau concentrations and protection by calmodulin against this inhibition similar to those obtained with purified synaptosomal PMCA. Functional studies were also performed with native and truncated versions of human cerebral PMCA4b, an isoform that has been showed to be functionally regulated by amyloid peptides, whose aggregates constitutes another hallmark of AD. Kinetic assays point out that tau binds to the C-terminal tail of PMCA, at a site distinct but close to the calmodulin binding domain. In conclusion, PMCA can be seen as a molecular target for tau-induced cytosolic calcium dysregulation in synaptic terminals.

Abstract: Many cells in an organism are exposed to constant and acute mechanical stress that can induce plasma membrane injuries. These plasma membrane wounds have to be resealed rapidly to guarantee cell survival. Plasma membrane resealing in response to mechanical strain has been studied in some detail in muscle, where it is required for efficient recovery after insult. However, less is known about the capacity of other cell types and tissues to perform membrane repair and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we show that vascular endothelial cells, which are subject to profound mechanical burden, can reseal plasma membrane holes inflicted by laser ablation. Resealing in endothelial cells is a Ca2+-dependent process, as it is inhibited when cells are wounded in Ca2+-free medium. We also show that annexin A1 (AnxA1), AnxA2 and AnxA6, Ca2+-regulated membrane binding proteins previously implicated in membrane resealing in other cell types, are rapidly recruited to the site of plasma membrane injury. S100A11, a known protein ligand of AnxA1, is also recruited to endothelial plasma membrane wounds, albeit with a different kinetic. Mutant expression experiments reveal that Ca2+ binding to AnxA2, the most abundant endothelial annexin, is required for translocation of the protein to the wound site. Furthermore, we show by knock-down and rescue experiments that AnxA2 is a positive regulator of plasma membrane resealing. Thus, vascular endothelial cells are capable of active, Ca2+-dependent plasma membrane resealing and this process requires the activity of AnxA2.

Abstract: Silencing Zonula occludens 2 (ZO-2), a tight junctions (TJ) scaffold protein, in epithelial cells (MDCK ZO-2 KD) triggers: 1) Decreased cell to substratum attachment, accompanied by reduced expression of claudin-7 and integrin β1, and increased vinculin recruitment to focal adhesions and stress fibers formation; 2) Lowered cell-cell aggregation and appearance of wider intercellular spaces; 3) Increased RhoA/ROCK activity, mediated by GEF-HI recruitment to cell borders by cingulin; 4) Increased Cdc42 activity, mitotic spindle disorientation and the appearance of cysts with multiple lumens; 5) Increased Rac and cofilin activity, multiple lamellipodia formation and random cell migration but increased wound closure; 6) Diminished cingulin phosphorylation and disappearance of planar network of microtubules at the TJ region; and 7) Increased transepithelial electrical resistance at steady state, coupled to an increased expression of ZO-1 and claudin-4 and a decreased expression of claudin-2 and paracingulin. Hence, ZO-2 is a crucial regulator of Rho proteins activity and the development of epithelial cytoarchitecture and barrier function.

Abstract: The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family belongs to the metzincin clan of zinc-dependent metallopeptidases. Due to their enormous implications in physiology and disease, MMPs have mainly been studied in vertebrates. They are engaged in extracellular protein processing and degradation, and present extensive paralogy, with 23 forms in humans. One characteristic of MMPs is a ~165-residue catalytic domain (CD), which has been structurally studied for 14 MMPs from human, mouse, rat, pig and the oral-microbiome bacterium Tannerella forsythia. These studies revealed close overall coincidence and characteristic structural features, which distinguish MMPs from other metzincins and give rise to a sequence pattern for their identification. Here, we reviewed the literature available on MMPs outside vertebrates and performed database searches for potential MMP CDs in invertebrates, plants, fungi, viruses, protists, archaea and bacteria. These and previous results revealed that MMPs are widely present in several copies in Eumetazoa and higher plants (Tracheophyta), but have just token presence in eukaryotic algae. A few dozen sequences were found in Ascomycota (within fungi) and in double-stranded DNA viruses infecting invertebrates (within viruses). In contrast, a few hundred sequences were found in archaea and >1000 in bacteria, with several copies for some species. Most of the archaeal and bacterial phyla containing potential MMPs are present in human oral and gut microbiomes. Overall, MMP-like sequences are present across all kingdoms of life, but their asymmetric distribution contradicts the vertical descent model from a eubacterial or archaeal ancestor.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle cell proliferation and differentiation are tightly regulated. Epigenetic regulation is a major component of the regulatory mechanism governing these processes. Histone modification is part of the epigenetic code used for transcriptional regulation of chromatin through the establishment of an active or repressive state for genes involved in myogenesis in a temporal manner. Here, we uncovered the function of SET domain containing 2 (Setd2), an essential histone 3 lysine 36 trimethyltransferase, in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. Setd2 was silenced in the skeletal muscle myoblast cell line, C2C12, using the CRISPR/CAS9 system. The mutant cells exhibited defect in myotube formation. The myotube formation marker, myosin heavy chain (MHC), was downregulated earlier in Setd2 silenced cells compared to wild-type myoblasts during differentiation. The deficiency in Setd2 also resulted in repression of Myogenin (MyoG) expression, a key myogenic regulator during differentiation. In addition to the myoblast differentiation defect, decreased proliferation rate with significantly reduced levels of histone 3 phosphorylation, indicative of cell proliferation defect, were observed in the Setd2 silenced cells; suggesting an impaired proliferation phenotype. Furthermore, compromised G1/S- and G2/M-phase transition and decreased expression levels of major regulators of cell cycle G1/S checkpoints, cyclin D1, CDK4, CDK6, and cyclin E2 were detected in Setd2 silenced cells. Consistent with the cell cycle arrested phenotype, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was upregulated in Setd2 silenced cells. Together, this study demonstrates an essential role of Setd2 in myoblast proliferation and differentiation, and uncovers Setd2-mediated molecular mechanism through regulating MyoG and p21.

Abstract: Dysregulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including cancer initiation and progression. Within this family, approximately 140 GPCRs have no known endogenous ligands and these “orphan” GPCRs remain poorly characterized. The orphan GPCR GPR19 was identified and cloned 2 decades ago, but relatively little is known about its physio-pathological relevance. We observed its expression to be elevated in breast cancers and therefore sought to investigate its potential role in breast cancer pathology. In this work, we show that overexpression of GPR19 drives mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells to adopt an epithelial-like phenotype, as demonstrated by the upregulation in E-cadherin expression and changes in functional behavior. We confirm a previous report that a peptide, adropin, is an endogenous ligand for GPR19. We further show that adropin-mediated activation of GPR19 activates the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, which is essential for the observed upregulation in E-cadherin and accompanying phenotypic changes. The recapitulation of epithelial characteristics at the secondary tumor sites is now understood to be an essential step in the colonization process. Taken together our work shows for the first time that GPR19 plays a potential role in metastasis by promoting the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) through the ERK/MAPK pathway, thus facilitating colonization of metastatic breast tumor cells.

Abstract: STIM1 and Orai1 are essential players of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in human skeletal muscle cells and are required for adult muscle differentiation. Besides these two proteins, TRPC (transient receptor potential canonical) channels and STIM1L (a longer STIM1 isoform) are also present on muscle cells. In the present study, we assessed the role of TRPC1, TRPC4 and STIM1L in SOCE, in the maintenance of repetitive Ca2+ transients and in muscle differentiation. Knockdown of TRPC1 and TRPC4 reduced SOCE by about 50% and significantly delayed the onset of Ca2+ entry, both effects similar to STIM1L invalidation. Upon store depletion, TRPC1 and TRPC4 appeared to interact preferentially with STIM1L compared to STIM1. STIM1L invalidation affected myoblast differentiation, with the formation of smaller myotubes, an effect similar to what we reported for TRPC1 and TRPC4 knockdown. On the contrary, the overexpression of STIM1L leads to the formation of larger myotubes. All together, these data strongly suggest that STIM1L and TRPC1/4 are working together in myotubes to ensure efficient store refilling and a proper differentiation program.

Abstract: Increasing circulating Ca2+ levels within the normal range has been reported to positively correlate with the incidence of fatal cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, limited studies have been able to delineate the potential mechanism(s) linking circulating Ca2+ to CVD. In this study, we exposed primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human umbilical vein cell line (EA.hy926) to different extracellular Ca2+ to mimic the physiological state. Our data revealed that increasing extracellular Ca2+ significantly enhanced susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-stimulated vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 expression and monocytes adhesion. Knocking-down VCAM-1 by siRNA abolished calcium-induced monocytes adhesion on HUVECs. Follow up mechanistic investigations identified that extracellular Ca2+-increased calcium influx contributed to the activation of VCAM-1. This was mediated via upregulation of transient receptor potential channel (TRPC)1 in a nuclear factor (NF)κB-dependent manner. Most importantly, we found that a novel TRPC1-regulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway exclusively contributed to calcium-induced NFκB activation. This study provided direct evidence that increasing extracellular Ca2+ enhanced TNF-alpha-induced VCAM-1 activation and monocytes adhesion. Moreover, we identified a novel TRPC1/ERK1/2/NFκB signaling pathway mediating VCAM-1 activation and monocyte adhesion in this pathological process. Our studies indicate that blood calcium levels should be strictly monitored to help prevent CVD, and that TRPC1 might act as a potential target for the treatment and prevention against increased circulating calcium-enhanced CVDs.

Abstract: Tumor cells translocating to distant sites are subjected to hemodynamic shear forces during their passage in the blood vessels. Low shear stress (LSS) plays a critical role in the regulation of various aspects of tumor cells functions, including motility and adhesion. Beyond its structural role, caveolin-1 (Cav-1), the important component of caveolae, represents a modulator of several cancer-associated functions as tumor progression and metastasis. However, the role of Cav-1 in regulating tumor cells response to shear stress remains poorly explored. Here, we characterized the role of LSS and Cav-1 in mediating cell motility and adhesion on human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells. We first showed that LSS exposure promoted cell polarity and focal adhesion (FA) dynamics, thus indicating elevated cell migration. Silencing of Cav-1 leaded to a significantly lower formation of stress fibers. However, LSS exposure was able to rescue it via the alteration of actin-associated proteins expression, including ROCK, p-MLC, cofilin and filamin A. Time-lapse migration assay indicated that Cav-1 expression fostered MDA-MB-231 cells motility and LSS triggered cells to rapidly generate new lamellipodia. Furthermore, Cav-1 and LSS significantly influenced cell adhesion. Taken together, our findings provide insights into mechanisms underlying LSS triggered events mediated by downstream Cav-1, including FAK/Src and ROCK/p-MLC pathways, involved in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, cell motility, FA dynamics and breast cancer cell adhesion.

Abstract: Rab7a, a small GTPase of the Rab family, is localized to late endosomes and controls late endocytic trafficking. The discovery of several Rab7a interacting proteins revealed that Rab7a function is closely connected to cytoskeletal elements. Indeed, Rab7a recruits on vesicles RILP and FYCO that are responsible for the movement of Rab7a-positive vesicles and/or organelles on microtubule tracks, but also directly interacts with Rac1, a fundamental regulator of actin cytoskeleton, and with peripherin and vimentin, two intermediate filament proteins. Considering all these interactions and, in particular, the fact that Rac1 and vimentin are key factors for cellular motility, we investigated a possible role of Rab7a in cell migration. We show here that Rab7a is needed for cell migration as Rab7a depletion causes slower migration of NCI H1299 cells affecting cell velocity and directness. Rab7a depletion negatively affects adhesion and spreading onto fibronectin substrates, altering β1-integrin activation, localization and intracellular trafficking, and myosin X localization. In fact, Rab7a-depleted cells show 40% less filopodia and active integrin accumulates at the leading edge of migrating cells. Furthermore, Rab7a depletion decreases the amount of active Rac1 but not its abundance and reduces the number of cells with vimentin filaments facing the wound, indicating that Rab7a has a role in the orientation of vimentin filaments during migration. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a key role of Rab7a in the regulation of different aspects of cell migration.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor. The heterogeneity at the cellular level, metabolic specificities and plasticity of the cancer cells are a challenge for glioblastoma treatment. Identification of cancer cells endowed with stem properties and able to propagate the tumor in animal xenografts has opened a new paradigm in cancer therapy. Thus, to increase efficacy and avoid tumor recurrence, therapies need to target not only the differentiated cells of the tumor mass, but also the cancer stem-like cells. These therapies need to be effective on cells present in the hypoxic, slightly acidic microenvironment found within tumors. Such a microenvironment is known to favor more aggressive undifferentiated phenotypes and a slow-growing “quiescent state” that preserves the cells from chemotherapeutic agents, which mostly target proliferating cells. Based on these considerations, we performed a differential screening of the Prestwick Chemical Library of approved drugs on both proliferating and quiescent glioblastoma stem-like cells and identified bisacodyl as a cytotoxic agent with selectivity for quiescent glioblastoma stem-like cells. In the present study we further characterize bisacodyl activity and show its efficacy in vitro on clonal macro-tumorospheres, as well as in vivo in glioblastoma mouse models. Our work further suggests that bisacodyl acts through inhibition of Ca2+ release from the InsP3 receptors.

Abstract: Myogenesis requires a well-coordinated withdrawal from cell cycle, morphological changes and cell fusion mediated by actin cytoskeleton. Grb2 is an adaptor protein whose central SH2 domain binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues of activated receptors and activates intracellular signaling pathway, while its N-terminal and C-terminal SH3 domains bind to proline rich proteins such as N-WASP (Neural-Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein). We found that the expression of Grb2 was increased at the beginning of differentiation and remained constant during differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts. Knocking down endogenous Grb2 expression caused a significant increase in the fusion index and expression of MyHC, a terminal differentiation marker when compared with the control. Over expression of Grb2 in C2C12 (C2C12Grb2-Myc) reduced myotube formation and expression of MyHC. Similarly over expression of Grb2P49L-Myc (N-terminal SH3 domain mutant) or Grb2R86K-Myc (SH2 domain mutant) inhibited myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. However, the expression of Grb2P206L-Myc (C-terminal SH3 domain mutant) did not inhibit myotube formation and expression of MyHC. This suggests that the C-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 is critical for the inhibition of myogenic differentiation. The C2C12Grb2-Myc cells have reduced phalloidin staining at late stages of differentiation. Expression of N-WASP in C2C12Grb2-Myc cells rescued the myogenic defect and increased phalloidin staining (increased F-actin) in these cells. Thus our results suggest that Grb2 is a negative regulator of myogenesis and reduces myogenic differentiation by inhibiting actin polymerization/remodeling through its C-terminal SH3 domain.

Abstract: Cellular senescence is an outcome of the accumulation of DNA damage which induces the growth arrest in cells. Physiologically, it is presumed to be mediated by accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we show that another free radical, nitric oxide (NO) produced during inflammation or present as an environmental pollutant can also induce cellular senescence. In primary cells and various immortalized cell lines, exposure to chronic NO, through external addition or internally generated by iNOS expression, leads to the activation of DNA damage response and causes cellular senescence. The phenotype generated by NO includes robust growth arrest, increase in the levels of the DNA damage foci, ROS, SAβ-gal staining, and inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-8, all hallmarks of cellular senescence similar to replicative senescence. Mechanistically, inhibitor and knockdown analysis revealed that NO mediates senescence through ATM kinase activation and the viability of cells is dependent on both ROS and ATM kinase involving the ATM-ROS-iNOS axis. Overall, we demonstrate that nitric oxide mediates cellular senescence through a novel free radical dependent genotoxic stress pathway.

Abstract: Phosphoinositides (PI) and converting enzymes are crucial determinants of organelle identity and morphology. One important endolysosomal specific PI is PI(3,5)P2, generated by the PIKfyve kinase, which orchestrates in combination with Vac14 and Fig4. Dysfunction of this complex leads to large intracellular vacuoles in various cell types and is linked to neurological diseases. Here, we characterize the vacuolization phenotype caused by overexpression of the PIKfyve binding deficient mutant Vac14L156R in podocytes, which represent specialized cells of the kidney. Vacuolization of podocytes, which was associated with strong maturation defects in the endolysosomal system, could be completely rescued by starvation or treatment of cells with the v-ATPase inhibitor Bafilomycin A1. Moreover, we elucidated a strong and reversible de-vacuolization effect of the cholesterol export inhibitor U18666A, which was accompanied by increased basification of the lysosomal pH values. Taken together, our data give new hints to potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of disease linked to intracellular vacuolization.

Abstract: Adenosine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that sense extracellular adenosine to transmit intracellular signals. One of the four adenosine receptor subtypes, the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), has an exceptionally long intracellular C terminus (A2AR-ct) that mediates interactions with a large array of proteins, including calmodulin and α-actinin. Here, we aimed to ascertain the α-actinin 1/calmodulin interplay whilst binding to A2AR and the role of Ca2+ in this process. First, we studied the A2AR-α-actinin 1 interaction by means of native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isothermal titration calorimetry, and surface plasmon resonance, using purified recombinant proteins. α-Actinin 1 binds the A2AR-ct through its distal calmodulin-like domain in a Ca2+-independent manner with a dissociation constant of 5–12μM, thus showing an ~100 times lower affinity compared to the A2AR-calmodulin/Ca2+ complex. Importantly, calmodulin displaced α-actinin 1 from the A2AR-ct in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, disrupting the A2AR-α-actinin 1 complex. Finally, we assessed the impact of Ca2+ on A2AR internalization in living cells, a function operated by the A2AR-α-actinin 1 complex. Interestingly, while Ca2+ influx did not affect constitutive A2AR endocytosis, it abolished agonist-dependent internalization. In addition, we demonstrated that the A2AR/α-actinin interaction plays a pivotal role in receptor internalization and function. Overall, our results suggest that the interplay of A2AR with calmodulin and α-actinin 1 is fine-tuned by Ca2+, a fact that might power agonist-mediated receptor internalization and function.

Abstract: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease often suffer from chronic and relapsing intestinal inflammation that favor the development of colitis associated cancer. An alteration of the epithelial intestinal barrier function observed in IBD is supposed to be a consequence of stress. It has been proposed that corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor (CRF2), one of the two receptors of CRF, the principal neuromediator of stress, acts on cholinergic nerves to induce stress-mediated epithelial barrier dysfunction. Non-neuronal acetylcholine (Ach) and muscarinic receptors (mAchR) also contribute to alterations of epithelial cell functions. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms through which stress and Ach modulate epithelial cell adhesive properties. We show that Ach-induced activation of mAchR in HT-29 cells results in cell dissociation together with changes in cell-matrix contacts, which correlates with the acquisition of invasive potential consistent with a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) mode of invasion. These processes result from mAchR subsequent stimulation of the cascade of src/Erk and FAK activation. Ach-induced secretion of laminin 332 leads to α3β1 integrin activation and RhoA-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We show that Ach-mediated effects on cell adhesion are blocked by astressin 2b, a CRF2 antagonist, suggesting that Ach action depends partly on CRF2 signaling. This is reinforced by the fact that Ach-mediated activation of mAchR stimulates both the synthesis and the release of CRF2 ligands in HT-29 cells (effects blocked by atropine). In summary, our data provides evidence for a novel intracellular circuit involving mAchR acting on CRF2-signaling that could mediate colonic mucosal barrier dysfunction and exacerbate mucosal inflammation.

Abstract: The importance of macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) in vascular endothelial cell (VEC) biology and dysfunction is increasingly recognized, but the molecular mechanisms of autophagy in VECs in the presence of serum are still poorly understood. Previously, we identified pterostilbene as a potent autophagy inducer of VECs in the presence of serum. In this study, we used pterostilbene as a tool to induce VEC autophagy and identified the differentially expressed genes using high-throughput DAN microarray. The small GTPase Ras-related protein in brain 13 (Rab13) was found to be the most significantly up-regulated gene in pterostilbene-treated human umbilical VECs (HUVECs). Knockdown of Rab13 blocked pterostilbene-induced mTOR inhibition and autophagy, whereas overexpression of the GTP-containing active form of Rab13 induced mTOR inhibition and autophagy in HUVECs. Using a combination of immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays, we demonstrated that pterostilbene or up-regulation of the active form of Rab13 promoted the interaction between Rab13 and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2). Knockdown of Grb2 suppressed pterostilbene or up-regulation of the active form of Rab13-induced autophagy. Further mechanistic studies revealed that Rab13 activated the downstream AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and blocked mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling by its functional interaction with Grb2 to regulate autophagy in HUVECs. Our study firmly establishes Rab13 as a novel regulator of autophagy in VECs under nutrient-enriched conditions.

Abstract: Anti-apoptotic B cell-lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) proteins are emerging as therapeutic targets in a variety of cancers for precision medicines, like the BH3-mimetic drug venetoclax (ABT-199), which antagonizes the hydrophobic cleft of Bcl-2. However, the impact of venetoclax on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and dynamics in cell systems has not been characterized in detail. Here, we show that venetoclax did not affect Ca2+-transport systems from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in permeabilized cell systems. Venetoclax (1μM) did neither trigger Ca2+ release by itself nor affect agonist-induced Ca2+ release in a variety of intact cell models. Among the different cell types, we also studied two Bcl-2-dependent cancer cell models with a varying sensitivity towards venetoclax, namely SU-DHL-4 and OCI-LY-1, both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines. Acute application of venetoclax did also not dysregulate Ca2+ signaling in these Bcl-2-dependent cancer cells. Moreover, venetoclax-induced cell death was independent of intracellular Ca2+ overload, since Ca2+ buffering using BAPTA-AM did not suppress venetoclax-induced cell death. This study therefore shows that venetoclax does not dysregulate the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in a variety of cell types, which may underlie its limited toxicity in human patients. Furthermore, venetoclax-induced cell death in Bcl-2-dependent cancer cells is not mediated by intracellular Ca2+ overload.

Abstract: Although Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell (HSPC) proliferation, survival and expansion have been shown to be supported by the cooperative action of different cytokines, little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways that are activated by cytokines upon binding to their receptors. Our study showed that Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) mRNAs are preferentially expressed in HSC compared to progenitors and differentiated cells of the myeloid and erythroid lineages. Conditional deletion of Grb2 induced a rapid decline of erythroid and myeloid progenitors and a progressive decline of HSC numbers in steady state conditions. We showed that when transplanted, Grb2 deleted bone marrow cells could not reconstitute irradiated recipients. Strinkingly, Grb2 deletion did not modify HSPC quiescence, but impaired LT-HSC and progenitors ability to respond a proliferative signal induced by 5FU in vivo and by various cytokines in vitro. We showed finally that Grb2 links IL3 signaling to the ERK/MAPK proliferative pathway and that both SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 are crucial for IL3 signaling in progenitor cells. Our findings position Grb2 as a key adaptor that integrates various cytokines response in cycling HSPC.

Abstract: The present study focuses on the identification of the gene expression profile of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRVCMs) after dynamic mechanical stretch through microarrays of RNA isolated from cells stretched for 2, 6 or 24h. In this analysis, myeloid leukemia factor-1 (MLF1) was found to be significantly downregulated during the course of stretch. We found that MLF1 is highly expressed in the heart, however, its cardiac function is unknown yet. In line with microarray data, MLF1 was profoundly downregulated in in vivo mouse models of cardiomyopathy, and also significantly reduced in the hearts of human patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Our data indicates that the overexpression of MLF1 in NRVCMs inhibited cell proliferation while augmenting apoptosis. Conversely, knockdown of MLF1 protected NRVCMs from apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation. Moreover, we found that knockdown of MLF1 protected NRVCMs from hypoxia-induced cell death. The observed accelerated apoptosis is attributed to the activation of caspase-3/-7/PARP-dependent apoptotic signaling and upregulation of p53. Most interestingly, MLF1 knockdown significantly upregulated the expression of D cyclins suggesting its possible role in cyclin-dependent cell proliferation. Taken together, we, for the first time, identified an important role for MLF1 in NRVCM proliferation.

Abstract: The two-pore domain potassium channel TASK-1 is strongly expressed in the heart and has been shown to modulate the resting membrane potential and action potential. However, little is known about the regulation of TASK-1 channels. The present study was designed to determine whether TASK-1 is modulated by caveolin-3, a primary structural protein of cardiac caveolae. Functional studies with the whole-cell voltage clamp technique showed that the expression of caveolin-3 decreased recombinant TASK-1 currents significantly in HEK293T cells, and this effect was prevented by co-expressing the dominant negative mutant caveolin-3 P104L. Immunofluorescence imaging revealed the colocalization of TASK-1 and caveolin-3. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that caveolin-3 associated with TASK-1. When co-expressed with caveolin-3 P104L, the fluorescence intensity of caveolin-3 on the cell periphery was reduced. This agrees with the functional evidence that caveolin-3 P104L prevented the inhibitory effect of caveolin-3 on TASK-1 currents, possibly via reducing the plasma membrane targeting of caveolin-3. Further, our data from cardiomyocytes suggest that TASK-1 is associated with caveolin-3. In summary, our study indicates that TASK-1 is functionally regulated by caveolin-3, possibly via association with each other on the cell surface. These results point out a novel mechanism in the regulation of TASK-1.

Abstract: Genetic deletion of the essential GTPase Gpn1 or replacement of the endogenous gene by partial loss of function mutants in yeast is associated with multiple cellular phenotypes, including in all cases a marked cytoplasmic retention of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Global inhibition of RNAPII-mediated transcription due to malfunction of Gpn1 precludes the identification and study of other cellular function(s) for this GTPase. In contrast to the single Gpn protein present in Archaea, eukaryotic Gpn1 possesses an extension of approximately 100 amino acids at the C-terminal end of the GTPase domain. To determine the importance of this C-terminal extension in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gpn1, we generated yeast strains expressing either C-terminal truncated (gpn1ΔC) or full-length ScGpn1. We found that ScGpn1ΔC was retained in the cell nucleus, an event physiologically relevant as gpn1ΔC cells contained a higher nuclear fraction of the RNAPII CTD phosphatase Rtr1. gpn1ΔC cells displayed an increased size, a delay in mitosis exit, and an increased sensitivity to the microtubule polymerization inhibitor benomyl at the cell proliferation level and two cellular events that depend on microtubule function: RNAPII nuclear targeting and vacuole integrity. These phenotypes were not caused by inhibition of RNAPII, as in gpn1ΔC cells RNAPII nuclear targeting and transcriptional activity were unaffected. These data, combined with our description here of a genetic interaction between GPN1 and BIK1, a microtubule plus-end tracking protein with a mitotic function, strongly suggest that the ScGpn1 C-terminal tail plays a critical role in microtubule dynamics and mitotic progression in an RNAPII-independent manner.

Identification of residues that control Li+ versus Na+ dependent Ca2+ exchange at the transport site of the mitochondrial NCLX,

Abstract: Background
The Na+/Ca2+/Li+ exchanger (NCLX) is a member of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger family. NCLX is unique in its capacity to transport both Na+ and Li+, unlike other members, which are Na+ selective. The major aim of this study was twofold, i.e., to identify NCLX residues that confer Li+ or Na+ selective Ca2+ transport and map their putative location on NCLX cation transport site.
Method
We combined molecular modeling to map transport site of NCLX with euryarchaeal H+/Ca2+ exchanger, CAX_Af, and fluorescence analysis to monitor Li+ versus Na+ dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux of transport site mutants of NCLX in permeabilized cells.
Result
Mutation of Asn149, Pro152, Asp153, Gly176, Asn467, Ser468, Gly494 and Asn498 partially or strongly abolished mitochondrial Ca2+ exchange activity in intact cells. In permeabilized cells, N149A, P152A, D153A, N467Q, S468T and G494S demonstrated normal Li+/Ca2+ exchange activity but a reduced Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. On the other hand, D471A showed dramatically reduced Li+/Ca2+ exchange, but Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity was unaffected. Finally, simultaneous mutation of four putative Ca2+ binding residues was required to completely abolish both Na+/Ca2+ and Li+/Ca2+ exchange activities.
Conclusions
We identified distinct Na+ and Li+ selective residues in the NCLX transport site. We propose that functional segregation in Li+ and Na+ sites reflects the functional properties of NCLX required for Ca2+ exchange under the unique membrane potential and ion gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
General significance
The results of this study provide functional insights into the unique Li+ and Na+ selectivity of the mitochondrial exchanger. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: ECS Meeting edited by Claus Heizmann, Joachim Krebs and Jacques Haiech.

Resveratrol-induced autophagy is dependent on IP3Rs and on cytosolic Ca2+,

Abstract: Previous work revealed that intracellular Ca2+ signals and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3R) are essential to increase autophagic flux in response to mTOR inhibition, induced by either nutrient starvation or rapamycin treatment. Here, we investigated whether autophagy induced by resveratrol, a polyphenolic phytochemical reported to trigger autophagy in a non-canonical way, also requires IP3Rs and Ca2+ signaling. Resveratrol augmented autophagic flux in a time-dependent manner in HeLa cells. Importantly, autophagy induced by resveratrol (80μM, 2h) was completely abolished in the presence of 10μM BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca2+-chelating agent. To elucidate the IP3R's role in this process, we employed the recently established HEK 3KO cells lacking all three IP3R isoforms. In contrast to the HEK293 wt cells and to HEK 3KO cells re-expressing IP3R1, autophagic responses in HEK 3KO cells exposed to resveratrol were severely impaired. These altered autophagic responses could not be attributed to alterations in the mTOR/p70S6K pathway, since resveratrol-induced inhibition of S6 phosphorylation was not abrogated by chelating cytosolic Ca2+ or by knocking out IP3Rs. Finally, we investigated whether resveratrol by itself induced Ca2+ release. In permeabilized HeLa cells, resveratrol neither affected the sarco- and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) activity nor the IP3-induced Ca2+ release nor the basal Ca2+ leak from the ER. Also, prolonged (4 h) treatment with 100μM resveratrol did not affect subsequent IP3-induced Ca2+ release. However, in intact HeLa cells, although resveratrol did not elicit cytosolic Ca2+ signals by itself, it acutely decreased the ER Ca2+-store content irrespective of the presence or absence of IP3Rs, leading to a dampened agonist-induced Ca2+ signaling. In conclusion, these results reveal that IP3Rs and cytosolic Ca2+ signaling are fundamentally important for driving autophagic flux, not only in response to mTOR inhibition but also in response to non-canonical autophagy inducers like resveratrol.

Abstract: Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp31p is a DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI family protein that was previously shown to be important for survival in the stationary phase of growth and under oxidative stress. Recently, it was identified as a chaperone or as glutathione-independent glyoxalase. To elucidate the role played by this protein in budding yeast cells, we investigated its involvement in the protection against diverse environmental stresses. Our study revealed that HSP31 gene expression is controlled by multiple transcription factors, including Yap1p, Cad1p, Msn2p, Msn4p, Haa1p and Hsf1p. These transcription factors mediate the HSP31 promoter responses to oxidative, osmotic and thermal stresses, to potentially toxic products of glycolysis, such as methylglyoxal and acetic acid, and to the diauxic shift. We also demonstrated that the absence of the HSP31 gene sensitizes cells to these stressors. Overproduction of Hsp31p and its homologue Hsp32p rescued the sensitivity of glo1Δ cells to methylglyoxal. Hsp31p also reversed the increased sensitivity of the ald6Δ strain to acetic acid. Since Hsp31p glyoxalase III coexists in S. cerevisiae cells with thousand-fold more potent glyoxalase I/II system, its biological purpose requires substantiation. We postulate that S. cerevisiae Hsp31p may have broader substrate specificity than previously proposed and is able to eliminate various toxic products of glycolysis. Alternatively, Hsp31p might be effective under high concentration of exogenous methylglyoxal present in some natural environmental niches populated by budding yeast, when glyoxalase I/II system capacity is saturated.

Abstract: Cells have developed complex transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to maintain intracellular homeostasis and withstand pathophysiological stressors. Feed-forward loops comprising transcription factors that drive expression of both target gene and a microRNA as negative regulator, are gaining increasing recognition as key regulatory elements of cellular homeostasis. The ATP-gated purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is an important driver of inflammation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous brain diseases including epilepsy. Changes in P2X7R expression have been reported in both experimental models and in epilepsy patients but the mechanism(s) controlling P2X7R levels remain incompletely understood. The specificity protein 1 (Sp1) has been shown to induce P2X7R transcription in vitro and recent data has identified microRNA-22 as a post-transcriptional repressor of P2X7R expression after seizures. In the present study we show that Sp1 can induce the transcription of both microRNA-22 and P2X7R in vitro during increased neuronal activity and in vivo in a mouse model of status epilepticus. We further show that Sp1-driven microRNA-22 transcription is calcium-sensitive and Sp1 occupancy of the microRNA-22 promoter region is blocked under conditions of seizure activity sufficient to elicit neuronal death. Taken together, our results suggest a neuronal activity-dependent P2X7R expression which is induced by the transcription factor Sp1 and repressed in a calcium-dependent manner by microRNA-22.

Abstract: All members of the Eph receptor family of tyrosine kinases contain a SAM domain near the C terminus, which has been proposed to play a role in receptor homotypic interactions and/or interactions with binding partners. The SAM domain of EphA2 is known to be important for receptor function, but its contribution to EphA2 lateral interactions in the plasma membrane has not been determined. Here we use a FRET-based approach to directly measure the effect of the SAM domain on the stability of EphA2 dimers on the cell surface in the absence of ligand binding. We also investigate the functional consequences of EphA2 SAM domain deletion. Surprisingly, we find that the EphA2 SAM domain inhibits receptor dimerization and decreases EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation. This role is dramatically different from the role of the SAM domain of the related EphA3 receptor, which we previously found to stabilize EphA3 dimers and increase EphA3 tyrosine phosphorylation in cells in the absence of ligand. Thus, the EphA2 SAM domain likely contributes to a unique mode of EphA2 interaction that leads to distinct signaling outputs.

Abstract: Erythropoietin (EPO) and GM-CSF are involved in erythropoiesis, while TGF-β inhibits proliferation but potentiates differentiation of erythroblasts. Since Syk inhibitor may induce anemia side effect in clinic, here we investigated the role of Syk in the biological actions of EPO and GM-CSF in erythropoiesis. In human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1, Syk inhibitor R406 exerts an enhancement effect with TGF-β to decrease cell viability, either in the absence or presence of EPO or GM-CSF. Such effect of R406 results from the reduced cell cycle progression and increased cell apoptosis. Notably, unlike Syk, Src family kinases are not involved in the viability control of TF-1 cells. Signaling studies showed that Syk is required for STAT5 and ERK activation induced by EPO, and Akt and ERK activation induced by GM-CSF. Nevertheless, R406 does not change the Smad2/3 signal caused by TGF-β, and TGF-β neither affects above signal pathways of EPO and GM-CSF. Of note, Syk is constitutively associated with EPOR in plasma membrane and can bind to STAT5 at active status upon EPO stimulation. Furthermore, EPO-induced hemoglobin γ expression was reduced by R406. In BFU-E and CFU-E colony formation assays in Syk-deficient erythroid progenitor cells, we confirmed the essential role of Syk in erythropoiesis mediated by EPO. Taken together, Syk is a novel upstream signaling molecule of EPOR, and contributes to erythroblast proliferation, survival and differentiation.

Abstract: Renal fibrosis is a common pathological feature of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) and its development and progression are significantly affected by epigenetic modifications such as aberrant miRNA and DNA methylation. Klotho is an anti-aging and anti-fibrotic protein and its early decline after renal injury is reportedly associated with aberrant DNA methylation. However, the key upstream pathological mediators and the molecular cascade leading to epigenetic Klotho suppression are not exclusively established. Here we investigate the epigenetic mechanism of Klotho deficiency and its functional relevance in renal fibrogenesis. Fibrotic kidneys induced by unilateral ureteral occlusion (UUO) displayed marked Klotho suppression and the promoter hypermethylation. These abnormalities were likely due to deregulated transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) since TGFβ alone caused the similar epigenetic aberrations in cultured renal cells and TGFβ blockade prevented the alterations in UUO kidney. Further investigation revealed that TGFβ enhanced DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and DNMT3a via inhibiting miR-152 and miR-30a in both renal cells and fibrotic kidneys. Accordingly the blockade of either TGFβ signaling or DNMT1/3a activities significantly recovered the Klotho loss and attenuated pro-fibrotic protein expression and renal fibrosis. Moreover, Klotho knockdown by RNA interferences abolished the anti-fibrotic effects of DNMT inhibition in both TGFβ-treated renal cell and UUO kidney, indicating that TGFβ-mediated miR-152/30a inhibitions, DNMT1/3a aberrations and subsequent Klotho loss constitute a critical regulatory loop that eliminates Klotho's anti-fibrotic activities and potentiates renal fibrogenesis. Thus, our study elaborates a novel epigenetic cascade of renal fibrogenesis and reveals the potential therapeutic targets for treating the renal fibrosis-associated kidney diseases.

Abstract: Several studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may play an essential role in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), which is an important step in tumor metastasis; however, little is known about the global change of lncRNA transcriptome during EMT. To investigate how lncRNA transcriptome alterations contribute to EMT progression regulation, we deep-sequenced the whole-transcriptome of MCF10A as the cells underwent TGF-β-induced EMT.
Results
Deep-sequencing results showed that the long RNA transcriptome of MCF10A had undergone global changes as early as 8h after treatment with TGF-β. The expression of 3403 known and novel lncRNAs, and 570 known and novel circRNAs were altered during EMT. To identify the key lncRNA-regulator, we constructed the co-expression network and found all junction nodes in the network are lncRNAs. One junction node, RP6-65G23.5, was further verified as a key regulator of EMT. Intriguingly, we identified 216 clusters containing lncRNAs which were located in “gene desert” regions. The expressions of all lncRNAs in these clusters changed concurrently during EMT, strongly suggesting that these clusters might play important roles in EMT. Our study reveals a global reprogramming of lncRNAs transcriptome during EMT and provides clues for the future study of the molecular mechanism of EMT.

Abstract: Parkin/PINK1-mediated mitophagy is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Prior to elimination of damaged mitochondria, Parkin translocates to mitochondria and induces mitochondrial clustering. While the mechanism of PINK1-dependent Parkin redistribution to mitochondria is now becoming clear, the role of mitochondrial clustering has been less well understood. In our study, we found that loss of p62 disrupted mitochondrial aggregation and specifically sensitized Parkin-expressing cells to apoptosis induced by mitochondrial depolarization. Notably, altering mitochondrial aggregation through regulating p62 or other methods was sufficient to affect such apoptosis. Moreover, disruption of mitochondrial aggregation promoted proteasome-dependent degradation of outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) proteins. The accelerated degradation in turn facilitated cytochrome c release from mitochondria, leading to apoptosis. Together, our study demonstrates a protective role of mitochondrial clustering in mitophagy and helps in understanding how aggregation defends cells against stress.

Abstract: The Tat system preferentially transports correctly folded proteins across the bacterial membrane although little is known of the proofreading mechanism. Most research has focused on TatABC systems from Gram-negative bacteria, especially Escherichia coli, and much less is known of the TatAC-type systems from Gram-positive organisms. We have previously shown that the Bacillus subtilis TatAdCd system is functional in an E. coli tat null background and able to transport TorA-GFP and native TorA (TMAO reductase); here, we examined its ability to transport other proteins bearing a TorA signal sequence. We show that whereas E. coli TatABC transports a wide range of biotherapeutics including human growth hormone, interferon α2b, a VH domain protein and 2 different scFvs, TatAdCd transports the scFvs but completely rejects the other proteins. The system also rejects two native E. coli substrates, NrfC and FhuD. Moreover, we have shown that TatABC will transport a wide range of folded scFv variants with the surface altered to incorporate multiple salt bridges, charged residues (5 glutamate, lysine or arginine), or hydrophobic residues (up to 6 leucines). In contrast, TatAdCd completely rejects many of these variants including those with 5 or 6 added Leu residues. The combined data show that the TatABC and TatAdCd systems have very different substrate selectivities, with the TatAdCd system displaying an extreme level of selectivity when compared to the E. coli system. The data also provide a preliminary suggestion that TatAdCd may not tolerate substrates that contain surface domains with a level of hydrophobicity above a certain threshold.

Abstract: Shear stress enhances diastolic and systolic Ca2+ concentration in ventricular myocytes. Here, using confocal Ca2+ imaging in rat ventricular myocytes, we assessed the effects of shear stress (~16dyn/cm2) on the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks and explored the mechanism underlying shear-mediated Ca2+ spark regulation. The frequency of Ca2+ sparks was immediately increased by shear stress (by ~80%), and increased further (by ~150%) during prolonged exposure (20s). The 2-D size and duration of individual sparks were increased by shear stimulation. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) only partially attenuated the prolonged shear-mediated enhancement in spark frequency. Pretreatment with antioxidants significantly attenuated the short- and long-term effects of shear on spark frequency. Microtubule or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (Nox2) inhibition abolished the immediate shear-induced increase in spark frequency and suppressed the effects of prolonged exposure to shear stress by ~70%. Scavenging of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial uncoupling also abolished the effect of short-term shear on spark occurrence, and markedly reduced (by ~80%) the effects of prolonged shear. Mitochondrial ROS levels increased under shear; this was eliminated by blocking Nox2. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content was increased only by prolonged shear. Our data suggest that shear stress enhances ventricular spark frequency mainly via ROS generated from mitochondria through Nox2, and that NOS and higher sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentrations may also contribute to the enhancement of Ca2+ sparks under shear stress.

Abstract: The GC-rich Binding Factor 2/Leucine Rich Repeat in the Flightless 1 Interaction Protein 1 gene (GCF2/LRRFIP1) is predicted to be alternatively spliced in five different isoforms. Although important peptide sequence differences are expected to result from this alternative splicing, to date, only the gene transcription regulator properties of LRRFIP1-Iso5 were unveiled. Based on molecular, cellular and biochemical data, we show here that the five isoforms define two molecular entities with different expression profiles in human tissues, subcellular localizations, oligomerization properties and transcription enhancer properties of the canonical Wnt pathway. We demonstrated that LRRFIP1-Iso3, -4 and -5, which share over 80% sequence identity, are primarily located in the cell cytoplasm and form homo and hetero-multimers between each other. In contrast, LRRFIP1-Iso1 and -2 are primarily located in the cell nucleus in part thanks to their shared C-terminal domain. Furthermore, we showed that LRRFIP1-Iso1 is preferentially expressed in the myocardium and skeletal muscle. Using the in vitro Topflash reporter assay we revealed that among LRRFIP1 isoforms, LRRFIP1-Iso1 is the strongest enhancer of the β-catenin Wnt canonical transcription pathway thanks to a specific N-terminal domain harboring two critical tryptophan residues (W76, 82). In addition, we showed that the Wnt enhancer properties of LRRFIP1-Iso1 depend on its homo-dimerisation which is governed by its specific coiled coil domain. Together our study identified LRRFIP1-Iso1 as a critical regulator of the Wnt canonical pathway with a potential role in myocyte differentiation and myogenesis.

Abstract: A disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) are a family of mSultidomain, membrane-anchored proteases that regulate diverse cellular functions, including cell adhesion, migration, proteolysis and other cell signaling events. Catalytically-active ADAMs act as ectodomain sheddases that proteolytically cleave type I and type II transmembrane proteins and some GPI-anchored proteins from the cellular surface. ADAMs can also modulate other cellular signaling events through a process known as regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). Through their proteolytic activity, ADAMs can rapidly modulate key cell signaling pathways in response to changes in the extracellular environment (e.g. inflammation) and play a central role in coordinating intercellular communication. Dysregulation of these processes through aberrant expression, or sustained ADAM activity, is linked to chronic inflammation, inflammation-associated cancer and tumorigenesis. ADAM10 was the first disintegrin-metalloproteinase demonstrated to have proteolytic activity and is the prototypic ADAM associated with RIP activity (e.g. sequential Notch receptor processing). ADAM10 is abundantly expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract and during normal intestinal homeostasis ADAM10 regulates many cellular processes associated with intestinal development, cell fate specification and maintenance of intestinal stem cell/progenitor populations. In addition, several signaling pathways that undergo ectodomain shedding by ADAM10 (e.g. Notch, EGFR/ErbB, IL-6/sIL-6R) help control intestinal injury/regenerative responses and may drive intestinal inflammation and colon cancer initiation and progression. Here, I review some of the proposed functions of ADAM10 associated with intestinal crypt homeostasis and tumorigenesis within the gastrointestinal tract in vivo.

Abstract: TGF-β inhibited membrane-associated protein (TIMAP) is greatly expressed in endothelial cell lines and serves as a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunit. Phosphorylation state of TIMAP, through affecting PP1 activity, has a remarkable effect on endothelial barrier function. Here we present evidence for a previously unidentified PKC phosphorylation site in TIMAP. Protein-protein interaction was detected in pulmonary endothelial cells between endogenous TIMAP and activated PKCα. PKCα phosphorylated the full length recombinant TIMAP in in vitro kinase assay and Ser331 of TIMAP was shown to be phosphorylated by PKC. Phosphorylation of TIMAP upon PKC activation in endothelial cells results in enrichment of TIMAP in the membrane, but no such change can be observed in PKC depleted cells. However, the previously identified PKA/GSK-3β induced enrichment of TIMAP at the plasma membrane was not affected in the absence of PKC. Interaction between TIMAP and the TIMAP-PP1 substrate phospho-ERM was described earlier, but now we show that binding of PKC phosphorylated TIMAP to ERM is severely reduced. This suggests an inhibitory effect of phospho-Ser331 on TIMAP-PP1 activity toward phospho-ERM. Accordingly, phospho-ERM level in the membrane fraction of the phospho-mimic S331D TIMAP mutant transfected cells was increased, but the S331A mutant overexpressing endothelial cells had a lower phospho-ERM level. Consistent with the phospho-ERM level, electric resistance measurements showed that the S331A mutation of TIMAP resulted in faster recovery from the PMA treatment. Taken together, phosphorylation of TIMAP on Ser331 by PKC represents a new mechanism of endothelial barrier regulation, through the inhibition of phospho-ERM dephosphorylation.

Abstract: OCTN2 (SLC22A5) is an organic cation/carnitine transporter belonging to the solute carrier transporters (SLC) family. OCTN2 is ubiquitously expressed and its presence was shown in various brain cells, including the endothelial cells forming blood-brain barrier, where it was mainly detected at abluminal membrane and in proximity of tight junctions (TJ). Since OCTN2 contains a PDZ-binding domain, the present study was focused on a possible role of transporter interaction with a TJ-associated protein ZO-1, containing PDZ domains and detected in rat Octn2 proteome. We showed previously that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in rat astrocytes regulates Octn2 surface presence and activity. Regulation of a wild type Octn2 and its deletion mutant without a PDZ binding motif were studied in heterologous expression system in HEK293 cells. Plasma membrane presence of overexpressed Octn2 did not depend on either PKC activation or presence of PDZ-binding motif, anyhow, as assayed in proximity ligation assay, the truncation of PDZ binding motif resulted in a strongly diminished Octn2/ZO-1 interaction and in a decreased transporter activity. The same effects on Octn2 activity were detected upon PKC activation, what correlated with ZO-1 phosphorylation. It is postulated that ZO-1, when not phosphorylated by PKC, keeps Octn2 in an active state, while elimination of this binding in ΔPDZ mutant or after ZO-1 phosphorylation leads to diminution of Octn2 activity.

Abstract: In the HAX1/HtrA2-OMI/PARL (HOP) mitochondrial protein complex, anti-apoptotic signals are generated by cleavage and activation of the serine protease HtrA2/OMI by the rhomboid protease PARL upon recruitment of both proteases to inner mitochondrial membrane protein HAX1 (HS1-associated protein X-1). Here we report the negative regulation of the HOP complex by human leukemia-associated myeloid leukemia factor 1 (MLF1). We demonstrate that MLF1 physically and functionally associates with HAX1 and HtrA2. Increased interaction of MLF1 with HAX1 and HtrA2 displaces HtrA2 from the HOP complex and inhibits HtrA2 cleavage and activation, resulting in the apoptotic cell death. Conversely, over-expressed HAX1 neutralizes MLF1's effect and inhibits MLF1-induced apoptosis. Importantly, Mlf1 deletion reverses B- and T-cell lymphopenia and significantly ameliorates the progressive striatal and cerebellar neurodegeneration observed in Hax1−/− mice, with a doubling of the lifespan of Mlf1−/−/Hax1−/− animals compared to Hax1−/− animals. Collectively, these data indicate that MLF1 serves as a proapoptotic antagonist that interacts with the HOP mitochondrial complex to modulate cell survival.

Abstract: The cochaperone BAG3 is a central protein homeostasis factor in mechanically strained mammalian cells. It mediates the degradation of unfolded and damaged forms of the actin-crosslinker filamin through chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA). In addition, BAG3 stimulates filamin transcription in order to compensate autophagic disposal and to maintain the actin cytoskeleton under strain. Here we demonstrate that BAG3 coordinates protein synthesis and autophagy through spatial regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The cochaperone utilizes its WW domain to contact a proline-rich motif in the tuberous sclerosis protein TSC1 that functions as an mTORC1 inhibitor in association with TSC2. Interaction with BAG3 results in a recruitment of TSC complexes to actin stress fibers, where the complexes act on a subpopulation of mTOR-positive vesicles associated with the cytoskeleton. Local inhibition of mTORC1 is essential to initiate autophagy at sites of filamin unfolding and damage. At the same time, BAG3-mediated sequestration of TSC1/TSC2 relieves mTORC1 inhibition in the remaining cytoplasm, which stimulates protein translation. In human muscle, an exercise-induced association of TSC1 with the cytoskeleton coincides with mTORC1 activation in the cytoplasm. The spatial regulation of mTORC1 exerted by BAG3 apparently provides the basis for a simultaneous induction of autophagy and protein synthesis to maintain the proteome under mechanical strain.

Abstract: Importin 13 (Imp13) is a bidirectional nuclear transporter of proteins involved in a range of important cellular processes, with an N-terminally truncated inhibitory isoform (tImp13) specifically expressed in testis. To gain insight into tImp13 function, we performed a yeast-2-hybrid screen from a human testis cDNA library, identifying for the first time a suite of interactors with roles in diverse cellular process. We validated the interaction of tImp13 with Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4γ2 (EIF4G2) and High mobility group containing protein 20A (HMG20A), benchmarking that with glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a known Imp13 interactor expressed in testis. Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated association of both tImp13 and Imp13 with EIF4G2, HMG20A and GR. Quantitative confocal microscopic analysis revealed the ability of tImp13 to inhibit the nuclear localisation of EIF4G2, HMG20A and GR, as well as that of Imp13 to act as a nuclear exporter for both EIF4G2 and HMG20A, and as a nuclear importer for GR. The physiological relevance of these results was highlighted by the cytoplasmic localisation of EIF4G2, HMG20A and GR in pachytene spermatocytes/round spermatids in the murine testis where tImp13 is present at high levels, in contrast to the nuclear localisation of HMG20A and GR in spermatogonia, where tImp13 is largely absent. Interestingly, Imp13, EIF4G2, HMG20A and GR were found together in the acrosome vesicle of murine epididymal spermatozoa. Collectively, our findings show, for the first time, that tImp13 may have a functional role in the mature spermatozoa, in addition to that in the meiotic germ cells of the testis.

Abstract: The cellular trafficking of numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is known to be regulated by Rab proteins that involves a direct protein:protein interaction between the receptor and the GTPase. In the case of the human prostacyclin receptor (hIP), it undergoes agonist-induced internalization and subsequent Rab11a-dependent recyclization involving an interaction between a Rab11-binding domain (RBD) localized within its carboxyl-tail domain with Rab11a. However, the GPCR-interacting domain on Rab11a itself is unknown. Hence, we sought to identify the region within Rab11a that mediates its interaction with the RBD of the hIP. The α4 helix region of Rab11 was identified as a novel binding domain for the hIP, a site entirely distinct from the Switch I/Switch II -regions that act as specific binding domain for most other Rab and Ras-like GTPase interactants. Specifically, Glu138 within α4 helix of Rab11a appears to contact with key residues (e.g. Lys304) within the RBD of the hIP, where such contacts differ depending on the agonist-activated versus -inactive status of the hIP. Through mutational studies, supported by in silico homology modelling of the inactive and active hIP:Rab11a complexes, a mechanism is proposed to explain both the constitutive and agonist-induced binding of Rab11a to regulate intracellular trafficking of the hIP. Collectively, these studies are not only the first to identify α4 helix of Rab11a as a protein binding domain on the GTPase but also reveal novel mechanistic insights into the intracellular trafficking of the hIP, and potentially of other members of the GPCR superfamily, involving Rab11-dependent mechanisms.

Abstract: Glioma stem cells (GSCs) make up highly tumorigenic subpopulations within gliomas, and aberrant expression of GSC genes is a major underlying cause of glioma pathogenesis and treatment failure. The present study characterized the expression and function of long non-coding RNA growth arrest specific 5 (GAS5) in GSCs in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which GAS5 contributes to glioma pathogenesis. We demonstrate that GAS5 suppresses GSC malignancy by binding to miR-196a-5p. miR-196a-5p, an onco-miRNA, stimulates GSC proliferation, migration, and invasion, in addition to reducing levels of apoptosis. miR-196a-5p specifically downregulates the expression of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) by targeting its 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR). FOXO1 upregulates expression of phosphotyrosine interaction domain containing 1 (PID1), thereby inhibiting GSC tumorigenicity and growth. FOXO1 also upregulates migration and invasion inhibitory protein (MIIP), resulting in attenuation of migration and invasion activities. Interestingly, we also show that FOXO1 promotes GAS5 transcription, thus forminga positive feedback loop. These data provide insights into potential new pathways for GSC molecular therapy and suggest that GAS5 may be an efficacious target for glioma treatments.

Abstract: The orexin (OX1R) and cholecystokinin A (CCK1R) receptors play opposing roles in the migration of the human colon cancer cell line HT-29, and may be involved in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. OX1R and CCK1R belong to family A of the G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), but the detailed mechanisms underlying their functions in solid tumor development remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether these two receptors heterodimerize, and the results revealed novel signal transduction mechanisms. Bioluminescence and Förster resonance energy transfer, as well as proximity ligation assays, demonstrated that OX1R and CCK1R heterodimerize in HEK293 and HT-29 cells, and that peptides corresponding to transmembrane domain 5 of OX1R impaired heterodimer formation. Stimulation of OX1R and CCK1R heterodimers with both orexin-A and CCK decreased the activation of Gαq, Gαi2, Gα12, and Gα13 and the migration of HT-29 cells in comparison with stimulation with orexin-A or CCK alone, but did not alter GPCR interactions with β-arrestins. These results suggest that OX1R and CCK1R heterodimerization plays an anti-migratory role in human colon cancer cells.

Abstract: A major intracellular calcium (Ca2+) uptake pathway in both excitable and non-excitable eukaryotic cells is store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). SOCE is the process by which endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stored Ca2+ depletion leads to activation of plasma membrane Ca2+ channels to provide a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels that mediate a plethora of physiological processes ranging from the immune response to platelet aggregation. Stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1) is the principal regulator of SOCE and responds to changes in ER stored Ca2+ through luminal sensing machinery composed of EF-hand and SAM domains (EFSAM). The EFSAM domain can undergo N-glycosylation at Asn131 and Asn171 sites; however, the precise role of EFSAM N-glycosylation in the Ca2+ sensing mechanism of STIM1 is unclear. By establishing a site-specific chemical approach to covalently linking glucose to EFSAM and examining α-helicity, thermal stability, three dimensional atomic-resolution structure, Ca2+ binding affinity and oligomerization, we show that N-glycosylation of the EFSAM domain enhances the properties that promote STIM1 activation. This augmentation occurs through changes in structure localized near the Asn131 and Asn171 sites that together permeate through the protein core and lead to decreased Ca2+ binding affinity, reduced stability and enhanced oligomerization. Congruently, Ca2+ influx via SOCE in HEK293 cells co-expressing Orai1 and STIM1 was diminished when N-glycosylation was blocked by introducing Asn131Gln and Asn171Gln mutations. Collectively, our data suggests that N-glycosylation enhances the EFSAM destabilization-coupled oligomerization in response to ER Ca2+ depletion thereby augmenting the role of STIM1 as a robust ON/OFF regulator of SOCE.

Abstract: Bcl-2 associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) contains a modular structure, through which BAG3 interacts with a wide range of proteins, thereby affording its capacity to regulate multifaceted biological processes. BAG3 is often highly expressed and functions as a pro-survival factor in many cancers. However, the oncogenic potential of BAG3 remains not fully understood. The cell cycle regulator, S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2) is increased in various cancers and plays an important role in tumorigenesis. The current study demonstrated that BAG3 promoted proliferation of ovarian cancer cells via upregulation of Skp2. BAG3 stabilized Skp2 mRNA via its 3′-untranslated region (UTR). The current study demonstrated that BAG3 interacted with Skp2 mRNA. In addition, miR-21-5p suppressed Skp2 expression, which was compromised by forced BAG3 expression. These results indicated that at least some oncogenic functions of BAG3 were mediated through posttranscriptional regulation of Skp2 via antagonizing suppressive action of miR-21-5p in ovarian cancer cells.

Abstract: Metformin is widely used to treat hyperglycemia. However, metformin treatment may induce intrahepatic cholestasis and liver injury in a few patients with type II diabetes through an unknown mechanism. Here we show that metformin decreases SIRT1 protein levels in primary hepatocytes and liver. Both metformin-treated wild-type C57 mice and hepatic SIRT1-mutant mice had increased hepatic and serum bile acid levels. However, metformin failed to change systemic bile acid levels in hepatic SIRT1-mutant mice. Molecular mechanism study indicates that SIRT1 directly interacts with and deacetylates Foxa2 to inhibit its transcriptional activity on expression of genes involved in bile acids synthesis and transport. Hepatic SIRT1 mutation elevates Foxa2 acetylation levels, which promotes Foxa2 binding to and activating genes involved in bile acids metabolism, impairing hepatic and systemic bile acid homeostasis. Our data clearly suggest that hepatic SIRT1 mediates metformin effects on systemic bile acid metabolism and modulation of SIRT1 activity in liver may be an attractive approach for treatment of bile acid-related diseases such as cholestasis.

Abstract: We screened >40,000 patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and found that the G6PD Kaiping allele was under the most positive selection for fighting against malaria in the Chinese population. However, the mechanism is unknown. The current study was designed to investigate the anti-malarial effect and mechanism of G6PD deficiency. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was utilised for inhibiting the G6PD activity of erythrocytes. Giemsa staining of blood smears and quantitative real-time PCR were used for the detection and quantification of Plasmodium falciparum infection. A transmission electron microscope was used to observe the structural changes of P. falciparum. An atomic force microscopy was used for the analyses of morphology, roughness and Young's Modulus of the infective erythrocyte membrane. When G6PD activity was inhibited by DHEA, the infection rate of P. falciparum decreased, its cell nucleus shrank, the cell organelles and metabolites were reduced gradually and the Young's Modulus of the erythrocyte membrane increased with increasing DHEA concentrations. These data indicated that Plasmodium multiplication would be inhibited in G6PD deficient erythrocytes because the Plasmodium organelles could not obtain enough nutrients, including ribose-5-phosphate and the reducing equivalent, NADPH. Moreover, the Young's Modulus of the erythrocyte membrane increased, which resulted in an increased membrane stiffness and decreased deformation. It was difficult for the merozoites to invade erythrocytes through endocytosis. Understanding these points will have a major effect on searching for new anti-malarial drug targets.

Abstract: Transient receptor potential (TRPs) channels are involved in thermogenesis, and temperature and energy balance control. Mice lacking TrpV1 become more obese and develop insulin resistance when fed with high fat diet; however, a relationship between metabolic disorders, TRP channels, and clock genes is still unknown. Based on this, we hypothesized that TRPV1 channels would be involved in the synchronization of clock genes in the peripheral tissues. To address this question, we used wild type (WT) and TrpV1 knockout (KO) mice kept in constant darkness (DD) or in light-dark cycle (LD). In WT mouse brown adipose tissue (BAT), TrpV1 oscillated with higher expression at scotophase, Per1 and Per2 showed the same profile, and Bmal1 transcript only oscillated in DD. Interestingly, the oscillatory profile of these clock genes was abolished in TrpV1 KO mice. WT mouse Ucp1 was upregulated in LD as compared to DD, showing no temporal variation; mice lacking TrpV1 showed Ucp1 oscillation with a peak at the photophase. Remarkably, TrpV1 KO mice displayed less total activity than WT only when submitted to LD. We provide evidence that TRPV1 is an important modulator of BAT clock gene oscillations. Therefore, temperature and/or light-dependent regulation of TRPV1 activity might provide novel pharmacological approaches to treat metabolic disorders.

Abstract: The ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases mediates activation of a wide network of signaling pathways. ErbB3 has weak kinase activity, but its six docking sites for the p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase make it an important contributor to proliferative signaling. ErbB3 has a relatively short half-life but the exact mechanisms controlling its turnover are unclear as contradictory reports exist. ErbB-mediated signaling is, however, negatively regulated by endocytosis of the receptors, followed by either recycling or degradation. Our previous studies showed that ErbB3 can be endocytosed and degraded in the absence of its ligand heregulin. However, binding of heregulin increased the degradation rate. In the current study we have investigated in more detail the trafficking and degradation of ErbB3 in the presence or absence of heregulin. We report that ErbB3 is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis both in the presence and absence of heregulin. Moreover, we show that both proteasomal and lysosomal activity regulate ErbB3 degradation. Although steady-state expression of ErbB3 is regulated by proteasomal activity to a large extent, probably linked to a previously identified ER-localized quantity control, the results indicate that internalization, both constitutive and ligand-induced, causes lysosomal degradation of ErbB3. Furthermore, we show that ErbB3 interacts with the ESCRT-0 subunit Hrs both in the presence and absence of heregulin. This indicates an ESCRT-mediated sorting of ErbB3 to late endosomes and lysosomes, and in line with this we show that impaired ESCRT function leads to an endosomal accumulation of ErbB3.

Abstract: Blasticidin S (BlaS) interferes in the cell growth of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Its mode of action as a protein synthesis inhibitor has been investigated extensively. However, the mechanism of BlaS transport into the target cells is not understood well. Here, we show that Ptr2, a member of the proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter (POT) family, is responsible for the uptake of BlaS in yeasts Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Notably, some mutants of Ptr2 that are dysfunctional in dipeptide uptake were still competent to transport BlaS. Mouse-derived oligopeptide transporter PepT1 conferred BlaS sensitivity in the S. cerevisiae ptr2∆ mutant. Furthermore, bacterial POT family proteins also potentiated the BlaS sensitivity of E. coli. The role of the POT family oligopeptide transporters in the uptake of BlaS is conserved across species from bacteria to mammals.

Abstract: Pex3 has been proposed to be important for the exit of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) from the ER, based on the observation that PMPs accumulate at the ER in Saccharomyces cerevisiae pex3 mutant cells. Using a combination of microscopy and biochemical approaches, we show that a subset of the PMPs, including the receptor docking protein Pex14, localizes to membrane vesicles in S. cerevisiae pex3 cells. These vesicles are morphologically distinct from the ER and do not co-sediment with ER markers in cell fractionation experiments. At the vesicles, Pex14 assembles with other peroxins (Pex13, Pex17, and Pex5) to form a complex with a composition similar to the PTS1 import pore in wild-type cells. Fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that also the PTS2 receptor Pex7, the importomer organizing peroxin Pex8, the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Pex4 with its recruiting PMP Pex22, as well as Pex15 and Pex25 co-localize with Pex14. Other peroxins (including the RING finger complex and Pex27) did not accumulate at these structures, of which Pex11 localized to mitochondria. In line with these observations, proteomic analysis showed that in addition to the docking proteins and Pex5, also Pex7, Pex4/Pex22 and Pex25 were present in Pex14 complexes isolated from pex3 cells. However, formation of the entire importomer was not observed, most likely because Pex8 and the RING proteins were absent in the Pex14 protein complexes. Our data suggest that peroxisomal membrane vesicles can form in the absence of Pex3 and that several PMPs can insert in these vesicles in a Pex3 independent manner.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in industrialised societies. Epidemiological studies, animal experiments, and randomized clinical trials have shown that dietary factors can influence all stages of colorectal carcinogenesis, from initiation through promotion to progression. Calcium is one of the factors with a chemoprophylactic effect in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to understand the molecular mechanisms of the anti-tumorigenic effects of extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o) in colon cancer cells. Gene expression microarray analysis of colon cancer cells treated for 1, 4, and 24h with 2mM [Ca2+]o identified significant changes in expression of 1571 probe sets (ANOVA, p<10−5). The main biological processes affected by [Ca2+]o were DNA replication, cell division, and regulation of transcription. All factors involved in DNA replication-licensing were significantly downregulated by [Ca2+]o. Furthermore, we show that the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G protein-coupled receptor is a mediator involved in this process. To test whether these results were physiologically relevant, we fed mice with a standard diet containing low (0.04%), intermediate (0.1%), or high (0.9%) levels of dietary calcium. The main molecules regulating replication licensing were inhibited also in vivo, in the colon of mice fed high calcium diet. We show that among the mechanisms behind the chemopreventive effect of [Ca2+]o is inhibition of replication licensing, a process often deregulated in neoplastic transformation. Our data suggest that dietary calcium is effective in preventing replicative stress, one of the main drivers of cancer and this process is mediated by the calcium-sensing receptor.

Abstract: We previously showed that MNRR1 (Mitochondrial Nuclear Retrograde Regulator 1, also CHCHD2) functions in two subcellular compartments, displaying a different function in each. In the mitochondria it is a stress regulator of respiration that binds to cytochrome c oxidase (COX) whereas in the nucleus it is a transactivator of COX4I2 and other hypoxia-stimulated genes. We now show that binding of MNRR1 to COX is promoted by phosphorylation at tyrosine-99 and that this interaction stimulates respiration. We show that phosphorylation of MNRR1 takes place in mitochondria and is mediated by Abl2 kinase (ARG). A family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A with an exaggerated phenotype harbors a Q112H mutation in MNRR1, located in a domain that is necessary for transcriptional activation by MNRR1. Furthermore, the mutation causes the protein to function suboptimally in the mitochondria in response to cellular stress. The Q112H mutation hinders the ability of the protein to interact with Abl kinase, leading to defective tyrosine phosphorylation and a resultant defect in respiration.

Abstract: Lucidone, which comprises a naturally occurring cyclopentenedione, has been investigated for its in vitro and in vivo wound healing properties, and the underlying molecular signaling cascades in the wound healing mechanism have been elucidated. We demonstrated the cell−/dose-specific responses of lucidone (0.5–8μM) on proliferation and migration/invasion of keratinocyte HaCaT and fibroblast Hs68 cells. In keratinocytes, lucidone-induced nuclear translocation of β-catenin was accompanied by increased transcriptional target genes, including c-Myc and cyclin-D1, through GSK3β-dependent pathway. Correspondingly, lucidone promoted the cell-cycle by increasing PCNA/CDK4 and decreasing p21/p27 expressions. Lucidone induced EMT through the downregulation of epithelial (E-cadherin/occludin) and upregulation of mesenchymal (vimentin/Twist/Snail) marker proteins. Activated MMP-9/−2 and uPA/uPAR as well as suppressed TIMP-1/−2 and PAI-1 expressions by lucidone may promote the migration/invasion of keratinocytes. Notably, lucidone activated NF-κB signaling via IKK-mediated-IκB degradation, and its inhibition abolished MMP-9 activation and keratinocyte migration. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling impaired the lucidone-induced proliferation/migration with corresponding suppression of β-catenin/c-Myc/cyclin-D1 and NF-κB/MMP-9 expressions. Results indicate that lucidone-induced PI3K/AKT signaling anchored the β-catenin/NF-κB-mediated healing mechanism. β-catenin knockdown substantially diminished lucidone-induced keratinocyte migration. Furthermore, lucidone increased endothelial cell proliferation/migration and triggered angiogenesis (MMP-9/uPA/ICAM-1). In macrophages, lucidone-activated NF-κB-mediated inflammation (COX-2/iNOS/NO) and VEGF, which may contribute to the growth of keratinocytes/fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Punched wounds on mice were rapidly healed with the topical application of lucidone (5mM) compared with control ointment-treated mice. Taken together, lucidone accelerates wound healing through the cooperation of keratinocyte/fibroblast/endothelial cell growth and migration and macrophage inflammation via PI3K/AKT, Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling cascade activation.

Abstract: Centrosome cohesion, mostly regarded as a proteinaceous linker between parental centrioles, ensures the interphase centrosome(s) to function as a single microtubule-organizing center. Maintenance of centrosome cohesion counts on a number of centrosomal linker proteins because depletion of any of those leads to premature centrosome separation in interphase, termed centrosome splitting. However, the underlying mechanisms of the dependence are unknown. Here, we show that absence of Rootletin triggers the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein (VHL)-mediated proteasomal degradation of Cep68 and, in turn, results in centrosome splitting. The VHL E3 ligase complex ubiquitinates Cep68 in vitro and in vivo. Co-silencing of Rootletin and VHL reverts Cep68 loss and centrosome splitting. Expression of a stable mutant of Cep68, either diminishing its polyubiquitylation or eliminating binding to β-domain of VHL, also suppresses centrosome splitting provoked by Rootletin depletion. We propose that the archetypal linker protein Rootletin maintains centrosome cohesion in part through inhibition of VHL-mediated Cep68 degradation.

Abstract: Throughout spermatogenesis, two important processes occur at late stage VIII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle in the rat testis: preleptotene spermatocytes commence entry into the adluminal compartment and step 19 spermatids release from the seminiferous epithelium. Presently, it is not clear how these processes, which involve extensive restructuring of unique Sertoli–Sertoli and Sertoli–germ cell junctions, are mediated. We aimed to determine whether annexin A2 (ANXA2), a Ca2+-dependent and phospholipid-binding protein, participates in cell junction dynamics. To address this, in vitro and in vivo RNA interference studies were performed on prepubertal Sertoli cells and adult rat testes. The endpoints of Anxa2 knockdown were determined by immunoblotting, morphological analyses, fluorescent immunostaining, and barrier integrity assays. In the testis, ANXA2 localized to the Sertoli cell stalk, with specific staining at the blood–testis barrier and the concave (ventral) surface of elongated spermatids. ANXA2 also bound actin when testis lysates were used for immunoprecipitation. Anxa2 knockdown was found to disrupt the Sertoli cell/blood–testis barrier in vitro and in vivo. The disruption in barrier function was substantiated by changes in the localization of claudin-11, zona occludens-1, N-cadherin, and β-catenin. Furthermore, Anxa2 knockdown resulted in spermiation defects caused by a dysfunction of tubulobulbar complexes, testis-specific actin-rich ultrastructures that internalize remnant cell junction components prior to spermiation. Additionally, there were changes in the localization of several tubulobulbar complex component proteins, including actin-related protein 3, cortactin, and dynamin I/II. Our results indicate that ANXA2 is critical for the integrity of the blood–testis barrier and the timely release of spermatids.

Abstract: During metastasis, cancer cell migration is enhanced. However, the mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we addressed this issue by functionally analyzing the transcription factor Sal-like 4 (SALL4) in basal-like breast cancer cells. Loss-of-function studies of SALL4 showed that this transcription factor is required for the spindle-shaped morphology and the enhanced migration of cancer cells. SALL4 also up-regulated integrin gene expression. The impaired cell migration observed in SALL4 knockdown cells was restored by overexpression of integrin α6 and β1. In addition, we clarified that integrin α6 and β1 formed a heterodimer. At the molecular level, loss of the SALL4 - integrin α6β1 network lost focal adhesion dynamics, which impairs cell migration. Over-activation of Rho is known to inhibit focal adhesion dynamics. We observed that SALL4 knockdown cells exhibited over-activation of Rho. Aberrant Rho activation was suppressed by integrin α6β1 expression, and pharmacological inhibition of Rho activity restored cell migration in SALL4 knockdown cells. These results indicated that the SALL4 - integrin α6β1 network promotes cell migration via modulation of Rho activity. Moreover, our zebrafish metastasis assays demonstrated that this gene network enhances cell migration in vivo. Our findings identify a potential new therapeutic target for the prevention of metastasis, and provide an improved understanding of cancer cell migration.

Abstract: Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is a major mechanism for the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and cellular function. Emerging evidence has revealed that altered expression and function of the molecular determinants of SOCE play a critical role in the development or maintenance of several cancer hallmarks, including enhanced proliferation and migration. Here we show that, in the acute myeloid leukemia cell line HL60, Orai2 is highly expressed at the transcript level, followed by the expression of Orai1. Using fluorescence Ca2+ imaging we found that Orai2 silencing significantly attenuated thapsigargin-induced SOCE, as well as knockdown of Orai1, while silencing the expression of both channels almost completely reduced SOCE, thus suggesting that SOCE in these cells is strongly dependent on Orai1 and Orai2. On the other hand, the expression of TRPC1, TRPC3 and TRPC6 is almost absent at the transcript and protein level. Bromodeoxyuridine cell proliferation assay revealed that Orai1 and Orai2 expression silencing significantly reduced HL60 cell proliferation. Furthermore, knockdown of Orai1 and Orai2 significantly attenuated the ability of HL60 to migrate in vitro as determined by transwell migration assay, probably due to the impairment of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. These findings provide evidence for a role for Orai1 and Orai2, in SOCE and migration in the human HL60 promyeloblastic cell line.

Abstract: Loss of function mutations of the protein MICU1, a regulator of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, cause a neuronal and muscular disorder characterised by impaired cognition, muscle weakness and an extrapyramidal motor disorder. We have shown previously that MICU1 mutations cause increased resting mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]m). We now explore the functional consequences of MICU1 mutations in patient derived fibroblasts in order to clarify the underlying pathophysiology of this disorder. We propose that deregulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through loss of MICU1 raises resting [Ca2+]m, initiating a futile Ca2+ cycle, whereby continuous mitochondrial Ca2+ influx is balanced by Ca2+ efflux through the sodium calcium exchanger (NLCXm). Thus, inhibition of NCLXm by CGP-37157 caused rapid mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation in patient but not control cells. We suggest that increased NCLX activity will increase sodium/proton exchange, potentially undermining oxidative phosphorylation, although this is balanced by dephosphorylation and activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in response to the increased [Ca2+]m. Consistent with this model, while ATP content in patient derived or control fibroblasts was not different, ATP increased significantly in response to CGP-37157 in the patient but not the control cells. In addition, EMRE expression levels were altered in MICU1 patient cells compared to the controls. The MICU1 mutations were associated with mitochondrial fragmentation which we show is related to altered DRP1 phosphorylation. Thus, MICU1 serves as a signal–noise discriminator in mitochondrial calcium signalling, limiting the energetic costs of mitochondrial Ca2+ signalling which may undermine oxidative phosphorylation, especially in tissues with highly dynamic energetic demands.

Abstract: Autophagy is a catabolic process that targets and degrades cytoplasmic materials. In skeletal muscle, autophagy is required for the control of mass under catabolic conditions, but is also basally active in the maintenance of myofiber homeostasis. In this study, we found that some specific autophagic markers (LC3-I, LC3-II, SQSTM1) were basally lower in glycolytic muscle compared to oxidative muscle of autophagy competent mice. In contrast, basal autophagic flux was higher in glycolytic muscle. In addition, we used several skeletal muscle-specific Atg7 transgenic mouse models to investigate the effect of acute (iAtg7−/−) and chronic (cAtg7−/−) autophagy deficiency on skeletal muscle morphology, contractility, and apoptotic signaling. While acute autophagy ablation (iAtg7−/−) resulted in increased centralized nuclei in glycolytic muscle, it did not alter contractile properties or measures of apoptosis and proteolysis. In contrast, with chronic autophagy deficiency (cAtg7−/−) there was an increased proportion of centralized nuclei, as well as reduced force and altered twitch kinetics in glycolytic muscle. Glycolytic muscle of cAtg7−/− mice also displayed an increased level of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX, as well as calpain and proteasomal enzymatic activity. Collectively, our data demonstrate cumulative damage from chronic skeletal muscle-specific autophagy deficiency with associated apoptotic and proteasomal upregulation. These findings point towards the importance of investigating different muscle/fiber types when studying skeletal muscle autophagy, and the critical role of autophagy in the maintenance of myofiber function, integrity, and cellular health.

Abstract: Norcantharidin (NCTD) is the demethylated form of cantharidin that exhibits anticancer potential in many cancer cell types. Recent reports suggest that NCTD targeting ROS/AMPK and DNA replication signaling pathway could be an effective strategy for the treatment of PCa cells. However, supportive evidence is limited to the effect of NCTD that induction of apoptosis through suppression of the Mcl-1. Here, we show that NCTD induced PCa cell apoptosis and triggered caspase activation, which was associated with mitochondria dysfunction. Mechanistic investigations suggested that NCTD modulated the Akt signaling via increased nuclear translocation and interaction with the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) promoter by FOXO4, resulting in an apoptotic effect. Moreover, miR-320d, which targets Mcl-1, was significantly upregulated after NCTD treatment. Overexpression of miR-320d by NCTD induced mitochondria dysfunction and apoptosis, which was notably attenuated with a miR-320d inhibitor. In vivo xenograft analysis revealed that NCTD significantly reduced tumor growth in mice with PC3 tumor xenografts. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the critical role of NCTD in suppressing Mcl-1 via epigenetic upregulation of miR-320d, resulting in PCa cell apoptosis.
