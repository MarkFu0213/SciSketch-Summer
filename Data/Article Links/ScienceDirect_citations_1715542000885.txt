Abstract: Summary
Poxvirus replication involves synthesis of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which can trigger antiviral responses by inducing phosphorylation-mediated activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and stimulating 2′5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS). PKR inactivates the translation initiation factor eIF2α via phosphorylation, while OAS induces the endonuclease RNase L to degrade RNA. We show that poxvirus decapping enzymes D9 and D10, which remove caps from mRNAs, inhibit these antiviral responses by preventing dsRNA accumulation. Catalytic site mutations of D9 and D10, but not of either enzyme alone, halt vaccinia virus late protein synthesis and inhibit virus replication. Infection with the D9-D10 mutant was accompanied by massive mRNA reduction, cleavage of ribosomal RNA, and phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2α that correlated with a ∼15-fold increase in dsRNA compared to wild-type virus. Additionally, mouse studies show extreme attenuation of the mutant virus. Thus, vaccinia virus decapping, in addition to targeting mRNAs for degradation, prevents dsRNA accumulation and anti-viral responses.

Abstract: Summary
Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) is a rare erythroid metabolic disease caused by mutations in the PKLR gene. Erythrocytes from PKD patients show an energetic imbalance causing chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, as pyruvate kinase defects impair ATP production in erythrocytes. We generated PKD induced pluripotent stem cells (PKDiPSCs) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB-MNCs) of PKD patients by non-integrative Sendai viral vectors. PKDiPSCs were gene edited to integrate a partial codon-optimized R-type pyruvate kinase cDNA in the second intron of the PKLR gene by TALEN-mediated homologous recombination (HR). Notably, we found allele specificity of HR led by the presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism. High numbers of erythroid cells derived from gene-edited PKDiPSCs showed correction of the energetic imbalance, providing an approach to correct metabolic erythroid diseases and demonstrating the practicality of this approach to generate the large cell numbers required for comprehensive biochemical and metabolic erythroid analyses.

Abstract: Summary
Research in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is rapidly developing and there are expectations that this research may obviate the need to use human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), the ethics of which has been a subject of controversy for more than 15 years. In this study, we investigated approximately 3,400 original research papers that reported an experimental use of these types of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and were published from 2008 to 2013. We found that research into both cell types was conducted independently and further expanded, accompanied by a growing intersection of both research fields. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of papers that reported the use of both cell types indicates that hESCs are still being used as a “gold standard,” but in a declining proportion of publications. Instead, the expanding research field is diversifying and hESC and hiPSC lines are increasingly being used in more independent research and application areas.

Abstract: There are many complex interactions between transposable elements (TEs) and host genomes. Environmental changes that induce stressful conditions help to contribute for increasing complexity of these interactions. The transposon mariner-Mos1 increases its mobilization under mild heat stress. It has putative heat shock elements (HSEs), which are probably activated by heat shock factors (HSFs). Ultraviolet radiation (UVC) is a stressor that has been suggested as able to activate heat shock protein genes (Hsp). In this study, we test the hypothesis that if UVC induces Hsp expression, as heat does, it could also promote mariner-Mos1 transposition and mobilization. The Drosophila simulans white-peach is a mutant lineage that indicates the mariner-Mos1 transposition phenotypically through the formation of mosaic eyes. This lineage was exposed to UVC or mild heat stress (28 °C) in order to evaluate the induction of mariner-Mos1 expression by RT-qPCR, as well as the mariner-Mos1 mobilization activity based on the count number of red spots in the eyes. The effects of both treatments on the developmental time of flies and cell cycle progression were also investigated. Both the analysis of eyes and mariner-Mos1 gene expression indicate that UVC radiation has no effect in mariner-Mos1 transposition, although heat increases the expression and mobilization of this TE soon after the treatment. However, the expression of Hsp70 gene increased after 24 h of UVC exposure, suggesting different pathway of activation. These results showed that heat promotes mariner-Mos1 mobilization, although UVC does not induce the expression or mobilization of this TE.

Abstract: Oxidative stress plays an important role in cardiovascular diseases. Studies have shown that miR-1 plays an important role in the regulation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which can be the result of oxidative stress. This study was designed to determine whether increased miR-1 levels lead to alterations in the expression of proteins related to oxidative stress, which could contribute to heart dysfunction. We compared cardiac function in wild-type (WT) and miR-1 transgene (miR-1/Tg) C57BL/6 mice (n ≥ 10/group). Echocardiography showed that stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), and fractional shortening (FS) were significantly decreased in miR-1/Tg mice. Concomitantly, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was elevated in the cardiomyocytes from the miR-1/Tg mice, and activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine kinase (CK) in plasma were also increased in the miR-1/Tg mice. All of these changes could be reversed by LNA-anti-miR-1. In the cardiomyocytes of neonatal Wistar rats, overexpression of miR-1 exhibits higher ROS levels and lower resistance to H2O2-induced oxidative stress. We demonstrated that SOD1, Gclc, and G6PD are novel targets of miR-1 for post-transcriptional repression. MicroRNA-1 post-transcriptionally represses the expression of SOD1, Gclc, and G6PD, which is likely to contribute to the increased ROS level and the susceptibility to oxidative stress of the hearts of miR-1 transgenic mice.

Abstract: PeBoW, a trimeric complex consisting of pescadillo (Pes1), block of proliferation (Bop1), and the WD repeat protein 12 (WDR12), is essential for processing and maturation of mammalian 5.8S and 28S ribosomal RNAs. Applying a mass spectrometric analysis, we identified the DEAD-box helicase DDX27 as stably associated factor of the PeBoW-complex. DDX27 interacts with the PeBoW-complex via an evolutionary conserved F×F motif in the N-terminal domain and is recruited to the nucleolus via its basic C-terminal domain. This recruitment is RNA-dependent and occurs independently of the PeBoW-complex. Interestingly, knockdown of DDX27, but not of Pes1, induces the accumulation of an extended form of the primary 47S rRNA. We conclude that DDX27 can interact specifically with the Pes1 and Bop1 but fulfils critical function(s) for proper 3′ end formation of 47S rRNA independently of the PeBoW-complex.

Abstract: Kidney transplantation is the major therapeutic option for end-stage kidney diseases. However, acute rejection could cause allograft loss in some of these patients. Emerging evidence supports that microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation is implicated in acute allograft rejection. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to profile miRNA expression in normal and acutely rejected kidney allografts. Among 75 identified dysregulated miRNAs, miR-10b was the most significantly downregulated miRNAs in rejected allografts. Transfecting miR-10b inhibitor into human renal glomerular endothelial cells recapitulated key features of acute allograft rejection, including endothelial cell apoptosis, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor α, interferon-γ, and chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2) and chemotaxis of macrophages whereas transfection of miR-10b mimics had opposite effects. Downregulation of miR-10b directly derepressed the expression of BCL2L11 (an apoptosis inducer) as revealed by luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, miR-10b downregulation mediates many aspects of disease pathogenicity of acute kidney allograft rejection. Restoring miR-10b expression in glomerular endothelial cells could be a novel therapeutic approach to reduce acute renal allograft loss.

Abstract: Summary
Time-lapse microscopy can capture patterns of development through multiple divisions for an entire clone of proliferating cells. Images are taken every few minutes over many days, generating data too vast to process completely by hand. Computational analysis of this data can benefit from occasional human guidance. Here we combine improved automated algorithms with minimized human validation to produce fully corrected segmentation, tracking, and lineaging results with dramatic reduction in effort. A web-based viewer provides access to data and results. The improved approach allows efficient analysis of large numbers of clones. Using this method, we studied populations of progenitor cells derived from the anterior and posterior embryonic mouse cerebral cortex, each growing in a standardized culture environment. Progenitors from the anterior cortex were smaller, less motile, and produced smaller clones compared to those from the posterior cortex, demonstrating cell-intrinsic differences that may contribute to the areal organization of the cerebral cortex.

Abstract: Our previous studies have shown that hydrostatic pressure can serve as an active regulator for bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). The current work further investigates the roles of cytoskeletal regulatory proteins Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) in hydrostatic pressure-related effects on BMSCs. Flow cytometry assays showed that the hydrostatic pressure promoted cell cycle initiation in a RhoA- and Rac1-dependent manner. Furthermore, fluorescence assays confirmed that RhoA played a positive and Rac1 displayed a negative role in the hydrostatic pressure-induced F-actin stress fiber assembly. Western blots suggested that RhoA and Rac1 play central roles in the pressure-inhibited ERK phosphorylation, and Rac1 but not RhoA was involved in the pressure-promoted JNK phosphorylation. Finally, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments showed that pressure promoted the expression of osteogenic marker genes in BMSCs at an early stage of osteogenic differentiation through the up-regulation of RhoA activity. Additionally, the PCR results showed that pressure enhanced the expression of chondrogenic marker genes in BMSCs during chondrogenic differentiation via the up-regulation of Rac1 activity. Collectively, our results suggested that RhoA and Rac1 are critical to the pressure-induced proliferation and differentiation, the stress fiber assembly, and MAPK activation in BMSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Gene inactivation by transposon insertion or allelic exchange is a powerful approach to probe gene function. Unfortunately, many microbes, including Chlamydia, are not amenable to routine molecular genetic manipulations. Here we describe an arrayed library of chemically induced mutants of the genetically intransigent pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, in which all mutations have been identified by whole-genome sequencing, providing a platform for reverse genetic applications. An analysis of possible loss-of-function mutations in the collection uncovered plasticity in the central metabolic properties of this obligate intracellular pathogen. We also describe the use of the library in a forward genetic screen that identified InaC as a bacterial factor that binds host ARF and 14-3-3 proteins and modulates F-actin assembly and Golgi redistribution around the pathogenic vacuole. This work provides a robust platform for reverse and forward genetic approaches in Chlamydia and should serve as a valuable resource to the community.

Abstract: Mucus hypersecretion is the key manifestation in patients with chronic inflammatory airway diseases and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is a major component of airway mucus. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, have been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory airway diseases. Hyperglycemia has been shown to be an independent risk factor for respiratory infections. We hypothesize that high glucose (HG)-regulates MMP-9 production and MMP-9 activity through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)/reactive oxygen species (ROS) cascades pathways, leading to mucin production in human airway epithelial cells (16HBE). We show that HG increases MMP-9 production, MMP-9 activity and MUC5AC expression. These effects are prevented by small interfering RNA (siRNA) for MMP-9, indicating that HG-induced mucin production is MMP-9-dependent. HG activates MMP-9 production, MMP-9 activity and MUC5AC overproduction, which is inhibited by nPG, DMSO and DPI (inhibitors of ROS and NADPH), suggesting that HG-activated mucin synthesis is mediated by NADPH/ROS in 16HBE cells. These observations demonstrate an important role for MMP-9 activated by NADPH/ROS signaling pathways in regulating HG-induced MUC5AC expression. These findings may bring new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of the infections related to diabetes mellitus and lead to novel therapeutic intervention for mucin overproduction in chronic inflammatory airway diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The application of cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine is gaining recognition. Here, we show that human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), also known as bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal cells, can be reprogrammed into renal proximal tubular-like epithelial cells using cell-free extracts. Streptolysin-O-permeabilized BMSCs exposed to HK2-cell extracts underwent morphological changes—formation of “domes” and tubule-like structures—and acquired epithelial functional properties such as transepithelial-resistance, albumin-binding, and uptake and specific markers E-cadherin and aquaporin-1. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of brush border microvilli and tight intercellular contacts. RNA sequencing showed tubular epithelial transcript abundance and revealed the upregulation of components of the EGFR pathway. Reprogrammed BMSCs integrated into self-forming kidney tissue and formed tubular structures. Reprogrammed BMSCs infused in immunodeficient mice with cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury engrafted into proximal tubuli, reduced renal injury and improved function. Thus, reprogrammed BMSCs are a promising cell resource for future cell therapy.

Abstract: Chaperonin containing the T-complex polypeptide-1 (CCT), which is known to be involved in intracellular assembly and folding of proteins, is a class of chaperonin omnipresent in all forms of life. Previous studies showed that CCT played a vital role in cold hardiness of various animals. In order to understand the response of the polypeptide complex to low temperature challenge and other environmental stresses, a subunit of CCT (CCTα) was cloned from the mud crab Scylla paramamosain by expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA SpCCTα was of 1972 bp and contained a 1668 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polypeptide of 555 amino acids with four conserved motifs. The messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of SpCCTα in ten tissues of adult S. paramamosain was subsequently examined and the highest expression was found in muscle, followed by gill, hepatopancreas, thoracic ganglion, hemocyte, heart, cerebral ganglion, stomach, eyestalk ganglion, and epidermis. The expressions of SpCCTα in the muscle of sub-adult crabs (pre-acclimated to 28 °C) subjected to the challenges of both lower temperatures (25, 20, 15, and 10 °C) alone and low temperatures (15 and 10 °C) in combination with salinity of 35 and 10 were further investigated by fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). It was revealed that when exposed to lower temperatures alone, the mRNA transcripts of the SpCCTα gene in the muscle were generally induced for significant higher expression at 10°C treatment than the 25, 20, and 15°C treatments; meanwhile, exposure to 15°C also frequently led to significantly higher expression than those at 20 and 25 °C. This finding indicated that the up-regulation of SpCCTα was closely related to the cold hardiness of S. paramamosain. The results of an additional experiment challenging the sub-adult crabs with various combinations of low temperatures with different salinity conditions generally demonstrated that at both 10 and 15 °C, the expression of SpCCTα under the high salinity of 35 was significantly lower than that at low salinity of 10, implying that the damages caused by low temperatures with high salinity were less than that under low salinity.

Abstract: The heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a highly abundant and ubiquitous molecular chaperone which plays essential roles in many cellular processes. In the present study, the messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of HSP90 after acute heat stress were investigated in two bay scallop populations (Argopecten irradians irradians and Argopecten irradians concentricus). The heat-resistant scallop A. i. concentricus, which is distributed in Zhanjiang, China, exhibited significantly higher induction of HSP90 compared with that of the heat-sensitive scallop A. i. irradians, which is distributed in Qinhuangdao, China. The promoter sequence of HSP90 gene from bay scallop (AiHSP90) was cloned, and the polymorphisms within this region were investigated by sequencing to analyze their association with heat tolerance. A total of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including −1167 T-C, −1023 A-C, −799 C-T, −774 A-G, −686 C-T, and −682 A-C, were identified in the amplified promoter region, and most of them affected the putative transcription factor binding sites except for locus −1167. All the six SNP sites were found to be associated with heat tolerance after Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and association analysis. Moreover, haplotypes CACACC and TCTATC were also found to be associated with heat tolerance based on the result of linkage disequilibrium and association analysis. The results provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the thermal adaptation of different congener endemic bay scallops, which suggested that the increased heat tolerance of A. i. concentricus (compared with A. i. irradians) was associated with the higher expression of AiHSP90. Meanwhile, the six genotypes (−1167 TT, −1023 CC, −799 TT, −774 GG, −686 CC, and −682 AA) and two haplotypes (CACACC and TCTATC) could be used as potential markers for scallop selection breeding with higher heat tolerance.

Abstract: Mycotoxins are considered to be significant contaminants of food and animal feed. Zearalenone (ZEN) is a non-steroidal estrogenic mycotoxin produced by several species of Fusarium in cereals and agricultural products. ZEN has been shown to be cytotoxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic in different cell types. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in ZEN-mediated toxicity in human intestine (HCT116) and kidney (HEK293) cells and evaluated the effects of the two common dietary compounds Quercetin (QUER) and Crocin (CRO). We show that ZEN treatment induces ER stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) as evidenced by XBP1 mRNA splicing and upregulation of GRP78, ATF4, GADD34, PDIA6, and CHOP. Activation of the ER stress response is associated with activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. This apoptotic process is characterized by an increase in ROS generation and lipid peroxidation, a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), and an activation of caspases and DNA damages. We also demonstrate that the antioxidant properties of QUER and CRO help to prevent ER stress and reduce ZEN-induced apoptosis in HCT116 and HEK293 cells. Our results suggest that antioxidant molecule might be helpful to prevent ZEN-induced ER stress and toxicity.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a commonly encountered emergency and severe neurosurgical injury. Previous studies have shown that the presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele has adverse outcomes across the spectrum of TBI severity. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of APOE alleles on trauma induced early apoptosis via modification of delayed rectifier K+ current (Ik(DR)) in neuronal/glial co-cultures model. An ex vivo neuronal/glial co-cultures model carrying individual APOE alleles (ε2, ε3, ε4) of mechanical injury was developed. Flow cytometry and patch clamp recording were performed to analyze the correlations among APOE genotypes, early apoptosis and Ik(DR). We found that APOEε4 increased early apoptosis at 24h (p<0.05) compared to the ones transfected with APOEε3 and APOEε2. Noticeably, APOEε4 significantly reduced the amplitude of the Ik(DR) at 24h compared to the APOEε3 and APOEε2 (p<0.05) which exacerbate Ca2+ influx. This indicates a possible effect of APOEε4 on early apoptosis via inhibiting Ik(DR) following injury which may adversely affect the outcome of TBI.

Abstract: Our previous study showed that PLCD1 significantly decreases cell proliferation and affects cell cycle progression in breast cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to investigate its functional and molecular mechanisms, and whether or not can become a new target for gene therapies. We found reduced PLCD1 protein expression in breast tumor tissues compared with paired surgical margin tissues. PLCD1 promoter CpG methylation was detected in 55 of 96 (57%) primary breast tumors, but not in surgical-margin tissues and normal breast tissues. Ectopic expression of PLCD1 inhibited breast tumor cell proliferation in vivo by inducing apoptosis and suppressed tumor cell migration by regulating cytoskeletal reorganization proteins including RhoA and phospho-cofilin. Furthermore, we found that PLCD1 induced p53 accumulation, increased p27 and p21 protein levels, and cleaved PARP. Finally, we constructed an adenoviral vector expressing PLCD1 (AdH5-PLCD1), which exhibited strong cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells. Our findings provide insights into the development of PLCD1 gene therapies for breast cancer and perhaps, other human cancers.

Abstract: When cells are grown to confluence, cell–cell contact inhibition occurs and drives the cells to enter reversible quiescence rather than senescence. Confluent retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells exhibiting contact inhibition was used as a model in this study to examine the role of overexpression of transcription factor AP4, a highly expressed transcription factor in many types of cancer, in these cells during long-term culture. We generated stable inducible RPE cell clones expressing AP4 or AP4 without the DNA binding domain (DN-AP4) and observed that, when cultured for 24 days, RPE cells with a high level of AP4 exhibit a large, flattened morphology and even cease proliferating; these changes were not observed in DN-AP4-expressing cells or non-induced cells. In addition, AP4-expressing cells exhibited senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. We demonstrated that the induced cellular senescence was mediated by enhanced p53 expression and that AP4 regulates the p53 gene by binding directly to two of the three E-boxes present on the promoter of the p53 gene. Moreover, we showed that serum is essential for AP4 in inducing p53-associated cellular senescence. Collectively, we showed that overexpression of AP4 mediates cellular senescence involving in activation of p53 in long-term post-confluent RPE cells.

Abstract: Summary
Malaria eradication is a major goal in public health but is challenged by relapsing malaria species, expanding drug resistance, and the influence of host genetics on antimalarial drug efficacy. To overcome these hurdles, it is imperative to establish in vitro assays of liver-stage malaria for drug testing. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) potentially allow the assessment of donor-specific drug responses, and iPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells (iHLCs) can facilitate the study of host genetics on host-pathogen interactions and the discovery of novel targets for antimalarial drug development. We establish in vitro liver-stage malaria infections in iHLCs using P. berghei, P. yoelii, P. falciparum, and P. vivax and show that differentiating cells acquire permissiveness to malaria infection at the hepatoblast stage. We also characterize antimalarial drug metabolism capabilities of iHLCs using prototypical antimalarial drugs and demonstrate that chemical maturation of iHLCs can improve their potential for antimalarial drug testing applications.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) defends itself against host immunity and chemotherapy at several levels, including the repair or degradation of irreversibly oxidized proteins (IOPs). To investigate how Mtb deals with IOPs that can neither be repaired nor degraded, we used new chemical and biochemical probes and improved image analysis algorithms for time-lapse microscopy to reveal a defense against stationary phase stress, oxidants, and antibiotics—the sequestration of IOPs into aggregates in association with the chaperone ClpB, followed by the asymmetric distribution of aggregates within bacteria and between their progeny. Progeny born with minimal IOPs grew faster and better survived a subsequent antibiotic stress than their IOP-burdened sibs. ClpB-deficient Mtb had a marked recovery defect from stationary phase or antibiotic exposure and survived poorly in mice. Treatment of tuberculosis might be assisted by drugs that cripple the pathway by which Mtb buffers, sequesters, and asymmetrically distributes IOPs.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) has recently been recognized to harbor therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of HCC, but it remains controversial as to whether IFN-α exerts direct cytotoxicity against HCC. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is overexpressed in HCC and is considered to play a role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the combined effect of a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, and IFN-α on in vitro growth suppression of HCC using the hepatoma cell line HLCZ01 and the in vivo nude mouse xenotransplantation model using HLCZ01 cells. Treatment with celecoxib and IFN-α synergistically inhibited cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Apoptosis was identified by 4׳,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride and fluorescent staining. IFN-α upregulated the expression of TRAIL, while celecoxib increased the expression of TRAIL receptors. The combined regimen with celecoxib and IFN-α reduced the growth of xenotransplanted HCCs in nude mice. The regulation of IFN-α- and COX-2 inhibitor-induced cell death is impaired in a subset of TRAIL-resistant cells. The molecular mechanisms of HCC cells resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis were explored using molecular biological and immunological methods. Interferon-α and the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib synergistically increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. These data suggest that IFN-α and celecoxib may offer a novel role with important implications in designing new therapeutics for TRAIL-resistant tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Brown adipocytes (BAs) play important roles in body temperature regulation, energy balance, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Activities of BAs are remarkably diminished in obese and diabetic patients, providing possibilities of transplanting functional BAs resulting in therapeutic benefit. Here, we show generation of functional BAs by cellular reprogramming procedures. Transduction of the PRDM16 gene into iPSC-derived embryoid bodies induced BA phenotypes (iBAs). Moreover, normal human fibroblasts were directly converted into BAs (dBAs) by C/EBP-β and C-MYC gene transduction. Approximately 90% of the fibroblasts were successfully converted within 12 days. The dBAs were highly active in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. Mouse dBAs were induced by Prdm16, C/ebp-β, and L-myc genes, and after transplantation, they significantly reduced diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in an UCP1-dependent manner. Thus, highly functional BAs can be generated by cellular reprogramming, suggesting a promising tailor-made cell therapy against metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: Summary
Despite advances in our understanding of interactions between mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their niche, little is known about communication between human HSCs and the microenvironment. Using a xenotransplantation model and intravital imaging, we demonstrate that human HSCs display distinct motile behaviors to their hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) counterparts, and the same pattern can be found between mouse HSCs and HPCs. HSCs become significantly less motile after transplantation, while progenitor cells remain motile. We show that human HSCs take longer to find their niche than previously expected and suggest that the niche be defined as the position where HSCs stop moving. Intravital imaging is the only technique to determine where in the bone marrow stem cells stop moving, and future analyses should focus on the environment surrounding the HSC at this point.

Abstract: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is a frequent complication in adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). To delay hip arthroplasty, core decompression combined with concentrated total bone marrow (BM) treatment is currently performed in the early stages of the osteonecrosis. Cell therapy efficacy depends on the quantity of implanted BM stromal cells. For this reason, expanded bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells) can be used to improve osteonecrosis treatment in SCD patients. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the function of BMSCs isolated from a large number of SCD patients with osteonecrosis (SCD-ON) compared with control groups (patients with osteonecrosis not related to SCD (ON) and normal donors (N)). BM total nuclear cells and colony-forming efficiency values (CFE) were significantly higher in SCD-ON patients than in age and sex-matched controls. The BMSCs from SCD-ON patients were similar to BMSCs from the control groups in terms of their phenotypic and functional properties. SCD-ON patients have a higher frequency of BMSCs that retain their bone regeneration potential. Our findings suggest that BMSCs isolated from SCD-ON patients can be used clinically in cell therapy approaches. This work provides important preclinical data that is necessary for the clinical application of expanded BMSCs in advanced therapies and medical products.

Abstract: Clenbuterol (CLB) is a beta2-adrenergic agonist commonly used in asthma therapy, but is also a non-steroidal anabolic drug often abused in sport doping practices. Here we evaluated the in vitro impact of CLB on the physiology and function of human monocytes and dendritic cells (DCs), instrumental in the development of immune responses. We demonstrate that CLB inhibits the differentiation of monocytes into DCs and this effect is specific and dependent on β2-adrenergic receptor (AR) activation. We found that CLB treatment reduced the percentage of CD1a+ immature DCs, while increasing the frequency of monocytes retaining CD14 surface expression. Moreover, CLB inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) enhanced IL-(interleukin)-10 and IL-6 production. In contrast, CLB did not modulate the phenotypic and functional properties of monocytes and DCs, such as the surface expression of HLA-DR, CD83, CD80 and CD86 molecules, cytokine production, immunostimulatory activity and phagocytic activity. Moreover, we found that CLB did not modulate the activation of NF-kB in DCs. Moreover, we found that the differentiation of monocytes into DCs was associated with a significant decrease of β2-ARs mRNA expression. These results provide new insights on the effect of CLB on monocyte differentiation into DCs. Considering the frequent illegal use of CLB in doping, our work suggests that this drug is potentially harmful to immune responses decreasing the supply of DCs, thus subverting immune surveillance.

Abstract: Summary
By accelerating global mRNA decay, many viruses impair host protein synthesis, limiting host defenses and stimulating virus mRNA translation. Vaccinia virus (VacV) encodes two decapping enzymes (D9, D10) that remove protective 5′ caps on mRNAs, presumably generating substrates for degradation by the host exonuclease Xrn1. Surprisingly, we find VacV infection of Xrn1-depleted cells inhibits protein synthesis, compromising virus growth. These effects are aggravated by D9 deficiency and dependent upon a virus transcription factor required for intermediate and late mRNA biogenesis. Considerable double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) accumulation in Xrn1-depleted cells is accompanied by activation of host dsRNA-responsive defenses controlled by PKR and 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), which respectively inactivate the translation initiation factor eIF2 and stimulate RNA cleavage by RNase L. This proceeds despite VacV-encoded PKR and RNase L antagonists being present. Moreover, Xrn1 depletion sensitizes uninfected cells to dsRNA treatment. Thus, Xrn1 is a cellular factor regulating dsRNA accumulation and dsRNA-responsive innate immune effectors.

Spontaneous ATM Gene Reversion in A-T iPSC to Produce an Isogenic Cell Line,

Abstract: Summary
A spontaneously reverted iPSC line was identified from an A-T subject with heterozygous ATM truncation mutations. The reverted iPSC line expressed ATM protein and was capable of radiation-induced phosphorylation of CHK2 and H2A.X. Genome-wide SNP analysis confirmed a match to source T cells and also to a distinct, non-reverted iPSC line from the same subject. Rearranged T cell receptor sequences predict that the iPSC culture originated as several independently reprogrammed cells that resolved into a single major clone, suggesting that gene correction likely occurred early in the reprogramming process. Gene expression analysis comparing ATM−/− iPSC lines to unrelated ATM+/− cells identifies a large number of differences, but comparing only the isogenic pair of A-T iPSC lines reveals that the primary pathway affected by loss of ATM is a diminished expression of p53-related mRNAs. Gene reversion in culture, although likely a rare event, provided a novel, reverted cell line for studying ATM function.

Abstract: Scope
Heterogeneity of breast cancer (BC) subtypes makes BC treatment difficult. α-linolenic acid (ALA), rich in flaxseed oil, has been shown to reduce growth and increase apoptosis in several BC cell lines, but the mechanism of action needs further understanding.
Methods and results
Four BC cell lines (MCF-7, BT-474, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) were incubated with 75μM ALA+1nM 17-β estradiol (E2) or 1nM E2 only (control) for 24h. MDA-MB-231 cells were additionally incubated at 6 and 12h. Viable cell number was measured, and expression of genes related to BC (signaling pathways, cell cycle, apoptosis) was quantified by real-time PCR array. There was a reduction in growth of all ALA treated cell lines after 24h, and in MDA-MB-231 cells this was time-dependent. Many genes were altered after 24h, and these differed between cell lines. In MDA-MB-231 cells, several gene expression changes were time-dependent.
Conclusions
ALA reduces growth of BC cell lines, by modifying signaling pathways, which differ between BC molecular subtypes. The ALA effect on gene expression is dynamic and changes over time, indicating the significance of incubation period in detecting gene changes.

Abstract: We previously reported the association of HSPA1A and HSPB1 with high-grade astrocytomas, suggesting that these proteins might be involved in disease outcome and response to treatment. With the aim to better understand the resistance/susceptibility processes associated to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment, the current study was performed in three human malignant glioma cell lines by focusing on several levels: (a) apoptotic index and senescence, (b) DNA damage, and (c) interaction of HSPB1 with players of the DNA damage response. Three human glioma cell lines, Gli36, U87, and DBTRG, were treated with TMZ evaluating cell viability and survival, apoptosis, senescence, and comets (comet assay). The expression of HSPA (HSPA1A and HSPA8), HSPB1, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), MLH1, and MSH2 was determined by immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. Immunoprecipitation was used to analyze protein interaction. The cell lines exhibited differences in viability, apoptosis, and senescence after TMZ administration. We then focused on Gli36 cells (relatively unstudied) which showed very low recovery capacity following TMZ treatment, and this was related to high DNA damage levels; however, the cells maintained their viability. In these cells, MGMT, MSH2, HSPA, and HSPB1 levels increased significantly after TMZ administration. In addition, MSH2 and HSPB1 proteins appeared co-localized by confocal microscopy. This co-localization increased after TMZ treatment, and in immunoprecipitation analysis, MSH2 and HSPB1 appeared interacting. In contrast, HSPB1 did not interact with MGMT. We show in glioma cells the biological effects of TMZ and how this drug affects the expression levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs), MGMT, MSH2, and MLH1. In Gli36 cells, the results suggest that interactions between HSPB1 and MSH2, including co-nuclear localization, may be important in determining cell sensitivity to TMZ.

Abstract: Summary
Genomic technologies have significantly advanced our understanding of the composition and diversity of host-associated microbial populations. However, their spatial organization and functional interactions relative to the host have been more challenging to study. Here we present a pipeline for the assessment of intestinal microbiota localization within immunofluorescence images of fixed gut cross-sections that includes a flexible software package, BacSpace, for high-throughput quantification of microbial organization. Applying this pipeline to gnotobiotic and human microbiota-colonized mice, we demonstrate that elimination of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) from the diet results in thinner mucus in the distal colon, increased proximity of microbes to the epithelium, and heightened expression of the inflammatory marker REG3β. Measurements of microbe-microbe proximity reveal that a MAC-deficient diet alters monophyletic spatial clustering. Furthermore, we quantify the invasion of Helicobacter pylori into the glands of the mouse stomach relative to host mitotic progenitor cells, illustrating the generalizability of this approach.

Abstract: Injury and loss of podocytes play vital roles in diabetic nephropathy progression. Emerging evidence suggests autophagy, which is induced by multiple stressors including hyperglycemia, plays a protective role. Meanwhile, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) possesses powerful anti-apoptotic properties. Therefore, we investigated the impact of autophagy on podocyte apoptosis under diabetic conditions and its association with HO-1. Mouse podocytes were cultured in vitro; apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Transmission electron microscopy and biochemical autophagic flux assays were used to measure the autophagy markers microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and beclin-1. LC3-II and beclin-1 expression peaked 12–24h after exposing podocytes to high glucose. Inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine or Beclin-1 siRNAs or Atg 5 siRNAs sensitized cells to apoptosis, suggesting autophagy is a survival mechanism. HO-1 inactivation inhibited autophagy, which aggravated podocyte injury in vitro. Hemin-induced autophagy also protected podocytes from hyperglycemia in vitro and was abrogated by HO-1 siRNA. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase phosphorylation was higher in hemin-treated and lower in HO-1 siRNA-treated podocytes. Suppression of AMPK activity reversed HO-1-mediated Beclin-1 upregulation and autophagy, indicating HO-1-mediated autophagy is AMPK dependent. These findings suggest HO-1 induction and regulation of autophagy are potential therapeutic targets for diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of in vivo repopulating hematopoietic cells from in vitro differentiating embryonic stem cells has remained a long-standing challenge. To date, hematopoietic engraftment has mostly been achieved through the enforced expression of ectopic transcription factors. Here, we describe serum-free culture conditions that allow the generation of in vivo repopulating hematopoietic cells in the absence of ectopically expressed factors. We show that repopulating activity arises immediately upon the commitment of mesodermal precursors to the blood program, within the first wave of hematopoietic specification. We establish that the formation of these progenitors is extremely transient and exquisitely sensitive to the cytokine milieu. Our findings define the precise differentiating stage at which hematopoietic repopulating activity first appears in vitro, and suggest that during embryonic stem cell differentiation, all hematopoietic programs are unraveled simultaneously from the mesoderm in the absence of cues that restrict the coordinated emergence of each lineage as is normally observed during embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The Mediator complex has recently been shown to be a key player in the maintenance of embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. However, the in vivo consequences of loss of many Mediator subunits are unknown. We identified med14 as the gene affected in the zebrafish logelei (log) mutant, which displayed a morphological arrest by 2 days of development. Surprisingly, microarray analysis showed that transcription was not broadly affected in log mutants. Indeed, log cells transplanted into a wild-type environment were able to survive into adulthood. In planarians, RNAi knockdown demonstrated a requirement for med14 and many other Mediator components in adult stem cell maintenance and regeneration. Multiple stem/progenitor cell populations were observed to be reduced or absent in zebrafish med14 mutant embryos. Taken together, our results show a critical, evolutionarily conserved, in vivo function for Med14 (and Mediator) in stem cell maintenance, distinct from a general role in transcription.

Abstract: One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides (Aβ) in senile plaques. Aβ-induced oxidative stress is believed to be responsible for degeneration and apoptosis of neurons and consequent cognitive and memory deficits. Here, we investigated the possible neuroprotective effect of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) against amyloid pathogenesis in adult male Wistar rats. GA or vehicle was injected into the lateral cerebral ventricles of rats 24 h before injection of Aβ (1–42) in CA1 area of hippocampus. The learning and memory of the rats were assessed 7 days after injection of Aβ using passive avoidance (PA) task. As potential contributing factors in Aβ-induced memory decline, we evaluated apoptotic markers and also used terminal-transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique to detect apoptosis in the hippocampus of Aβ-injected rats. Our behavioral data suggest that GA pretreatment can significantly suppress memory deficits in Aβ-injected rats. There was also not only a marked increase in Hsp70 level but also upregulated 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the hippocampus of GA-treated groups with a reduction in apoptotic factors including caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and TUNEL-positive cells as well. Thus, we conclude that GA exerts its protective effects against Aβ (1–42) toxicity and memory deficits, at least in part, by upregulating of Hsp70 and P70S6K.

Abstract: The methylation of cytosine at CpG dinucleotides (5meC) is an important epigenetic mechanism that governs genome stability and gene expression. Important ontological and pathological transitions are associated with marked global changes in detectable levels of methylation. We have previously found two pools of immune-detectable 5meC exist within cells, a pool that can be detected after acid treatment of fixed cells to denature chromatin and another large but variable pool that requires a further tryptic digestion step for complete epitope retrieval. The trypsin-sensitive pool has been shown to be largely associated with the heterochromatic fraction (by a heterochromatin marker, HP1-β) of the genome, and the size of this pool varies with the growth disposition of cells. Since DNA damage imposes large changes on chromatin structure the present study analyzed how such changes influences the faithful immunological detection of 5meC within mouse embryonic fibroblasts. DNA damage was induced by either UV-irradiation or doxorubicin treatment, each of which resulted in increased levels of immune-detectable 5meC at 24–48h after treatment. There was a marked trypsin-sensitive pool of 5meC in these cells which was significantly increased after DNA damage. The increased levels of 5meC staining predominantly co-located with heterochromatic foci within nuclei, as assessed by HP1-β staining. The relative amount of masked 5meC after DNA damage was positively associated with increased levels of HP1-β. The methyl binding protein, MBD1, was a less reliable measure of changes in 5meC, with a significant fraction of 5meC not being marked by MBD1. The cyto-epigenetic approaches used here reveal dynamism in the levels and localization of immune-detectable 5meC within the nuclei of fibroblasts in response to DNA damage.

Abstract: Epigenetic changes are involved in learning and memory, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are considered potential therapeutic agents for Alzheimer׳s disease (AD). We previously reported that (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) acts as an HDAC inhibitor. Here, we demonstrate that EGCG reduced β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in vitro and rescued cognitive deterioration in senescence-accelerated mice P8 (SAMP8) via intragastric administration of low- and high-dose EGCG (5 and 15mg/kg, respectively) for 60 days. The AD brain has decreased levels of the rate-limiting degradation enzyme of Aβ, neprilysin (NEP). We found an association between EGCG-induced reduction in Aβ accumulation and elevated NEP expression. Further, NEP silencing prevented the EGCG-induced Aβ downregulation. Our findings suggest that EGCG might be effective for treating AD.

Abstract: The emergence of new methods for reprogramming of adult somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) led to the development of new approaches in drug discovery and regenerative medicine. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the self-renewal, expansion and differentiation of human iPSC (hiPSC) should lead to improvements in the manufacture of safe and reliable cell therapy products. The goal of our study was qualitative and quantitative proteomic characterizations of hiPSC by means of electrospray ionization (ESI)-MSe and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (MS). Proteomes of hiPSCs of different somatic origins: fibroblasts and peripheral blood CD34+ cells, reprogrammed by the same technique, were compared with the original somatic cells and hESC. Quantitative proteomic comparison revealed approximately 220 proteins commonly up-regulated in all three pluripotent stem cell lines compared to the primary cells. Expression of 21 proteins previously reported as pluripotency markers was up-regulated in both hiPSCs (8 were confirmed by Western blot). A number of novel candidate marker proteins with the highest fold-change difference between hiPSCs/hESC and somatic cells discovered by MS were confirmed by Western blot. A panel of 22 candidate marker proteins of hiPSC was developed and expression of these proteins was confirmed in 8 additional hiPSC lines.

Abstract: The tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) family of receptor tyrosine kinases controls synaptic function, plasticity and sustains differentiation, morphology, and neuronal cell survival. Understanding Trk receptors down-regulation and recycling is a crucial step to point out sympathetic and sensory neuron function and survival. PC12 cells derived from pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla have been widely used as a model system for studies of neuronal differentiation as they respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) with a dramatic change in phenotype and acquire a number of properties characteristic of sympathetic neurons. In this study we demonstrated that in PC12 cells the TrkA receptor interacts with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP8/UBPy in a NGF-dependent manner and that it is deubiquitinated in vivo and in vitro by USP8. USP8 overexpression blocked NGF-induced neurites outgrowth while the overexpression of the catalytically inactive mutant USP8/UBPyC748A caused a marked increase of cell differentiation. Localization and biochemical experiments have point out that USP8 and TrkA partially co-localize in endosomes after NGF stimulation. Finally we have studied the role played by USP8 on TrkA turnover; using specific siRNA for USP8 we found that USP8 knockdown increases TrkA half-life, suggesting that the deubiquitinating activity of USP8 promotes TrkA degradation.

Abstract: Summary
The differentiation and protective capacity of Plasmodium-specific T cells are regulated by both positive and negative signals during malaria, but the molecular and cellular details remain poorly defined. Here we show that malaria patients and Plasmodium-infected rodents exhibit atypical expression of the co-stimulatory receptor OX40 on CD4 T cells and that therapeutic enhancement of OX40 signaling enhances helper CD4 T cell activity, humoral immunity, and parasite clearance in rodents. However, these beneficial effects of OX40 signaling are abrogated following coordinate blockade of PD-1 co-inhibitory pathways, which are also upregulated during malaria and associated with elevated parasitemia. Co-administration of biologics blocking PD-1 and promoting OX40 signaling induces excessive interferon-gamma that directly limits helper T cell-mediated support of humoral immunity and decreases parasite control. Our results show that targeting OX40 can enhance Plasmodium control and that crosstalk between co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory pathways in pathogen-specific CD4 T cells can impact pathogen clearance.

Abstract: Mutations in Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, are associated to autosomal recessive Parkinson׳s disease (PD). Parkin has been mainly implicated, along with Pink1, in mitochondrial autophagy in response to stress. In this study, a yeast model was developed to analyse the biological function of human Parkin. We observed that Parkin increases yeast chronological lifespan and oxidative stress resistance, through a mitochondrial-dependent pathway. Moreover, in response to H2O2, Parkin translocate to mitochondria, leading to a higher mitochondrial degradation. Parkin-induced H2O2 resistance is dependent on the autophagic pathway and on the mitochondrial protein Por1p. Although expression of Pink1 induces an H2O2 resistance phenotype similar to Parkin, co-expression of both proteins does not result in a synergistic effect. Concerning H2O2 resistance, this may indicate that these two proteins independently affect the same pathway. Altogether, this work establishes a yeast model for Parkin, which may provide new insights on Parkin function and potential mechanisms of pathogenicity.

Abstract: Summary
The microbial communities inhabiting the root interior of healthy plants, as well as the rhizosphere, which consists of soil particles firmly attached to roots, engage in symbiotic associations with their host. To investigate the structural and functional diversification among these communities, we employed a combination of 16S rRNA gene profiling and shotgun metagenome analysis of the microbiota associated with wild and domesticated accessions of barley (Hordeum vulgare). Bacterial families Comamonadaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Rhizobiaceae dominate the barley root-enriched microbiota. Host genotype has a small, but significant, effect on the diversity of root-associated bacterial communities, possibly representing a footprint of barley domestication. Traits related to pathogenesis, secretion, phage interactions, and nutrient mobilization are enriched in the barley root-associated microbiota. Strikingly, protein families assigned to these same traits showed evidence of positive selection. Our results indicate that the combined action of microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions drives microbiota differentiation at the root-soil interface.

Abstract: Summary
The RNA-binding protein L1TD1 is one of the most specific and abundant proteins in pluripotent stem cells and is essential for the maintenance of pluripotency in human cells. Here, we identify the protein interaction network of L1TD1 in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and provide insights into the interactome network constructed in human pluripotent cells. Our data reveal that L1TD1 has an important role in RNA splicing, translation, protein traffic, and degradation. L1TD1 interacts with multiple stem-cell-specific proteins, many of which are still uncharacterized in the context of development. Further, we show that L1TD1 is a part of the pluripotency interactome network of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, bridging nuclear and cytoplasmic regulation and highlighting the importance of RNA biology in pluripotency.

Abstract: CLN5 is a soluble lysosomal glycoprotein. Deficiency in CLN5 protein causes neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, an inherited neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder. The function of CLN5 and how it affects lysosome activity are unclear. We identified two forms of the CLN5 protein present in most of the cell lines studied. The molecular mass difference between these two forms is about 4kDa. The fibroblast cells derived from two CLN5 patients lack both forms. Using transient transfection, we showed one of these two forms is a proprotein and the other is a C-terminal cleaved mature form. Using cycloheximide chase analysis, we were able to demonstrate that the C-terminal processing occurs post-translationally. By treating cells with several pharmaceutical drugs to inhibit proteases, we showed that the C-terminal processing takes place in an acidic compartment and the protease involved is most likely a cysteine protease. This is further supported by overexpression of a CLN5 patient mutant D279N and a glycosylation mutant N401Q, showing that the C-terminal processing takes place beyond the endoplasmic reticulum, and can occur as early as from the trans Golgi network. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CLN5 is expressed in a variety of murine tissues.

SUV420H2 suppresses breast cancer cell invasion through down regulation of the SH2 domain-containing focal adhesion protein tensin-3,

Abstract: The genome-wide loss of histone H4 lysine 20 tri-methylation (H4K20me3) is observed in multiple types of cancer, including breast tumors. Since H4K20me3 is preferentially targeted to repetitive elements in the pericentromeric and telomeric heterochromatin and plays a role in chromatin integrity, the pathological effects of disrupted H4K20me3 in tumors have been attributed to genomic instability. However, in this report, we show that loss of H4K20me3 modulates gene expression profiles, leading to increased cell invasion. Reduced H4K20me3 levels in tumor cells are often accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the H4K20-specific methyltransferase, SUV420H2. Exogenous delivery of SUV420H2 into MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells induced selective and specific changes in the expression of cancer-related genes. One of the most downregulated genes in response to SUV420H2 expression was the Src substrate, tensin-3, a focal adhesion protein that contributes to cancer cell migration. Depletion of tensin-3 suppressed breast cancer cell invasiveness. Furthermore, silencing of tensin-3 was associated with enrichment of H4K20me3 immediately upstream of the tensin-3 transcription start site, suggesting that the loss of H4K20me3 in tumor cells induced the expression of cancer-promoting genes. These findings connect the loss of H4K20me3 with tumor progression, through the transcriptional activation of cancer-promoting genes.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) depends on the integration of the multiple signals received from the bone marrow niche. We show the relevance of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN13 and β-catenin as intracellular signaling molecules to control HSCs adhesiveness, cell cycling, and quiescence. Lethally irradiated mice transplanted with Lin– bone marrow cells in which PTPN13 or β-catenin had been silenced showed a significant increase of long-term (LT) and short-term (ST) HSCs. A decrease in cycling cells was also found, together with an increase in quiescence. The decreased expression of PTPN13 or β-catenin was linked to the upregulation of several genes coding for integrins and several cadherins, explaining the higher cell adhesiveness. Our data are consistent with the notion that the levels of PTPN13 and β-catenin must be strictly regulated by extracellular signaling to regulate HSC attachment to the niche and the balance between proliferation and quiescence.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most-common genetic determinants of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The G2019S mutation is detected most frequently and is associated with increased kinase activity. Whereas G2019S mutant dopamine neurons exhibit neurite elongation deficits, the effect of G2019S on other neuronal subtypes is unknown. As PD patients also suffer from non-motor symptoms that may be unrelated to dopamine neuron loss, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to assess morphological and functional properties of peripheral sensory neurons. LRRK2 G2019S iPSC-derived sensory neurons exhibited normal neurite length but had large microtubule-containing neurite aggregations. Additionally, LRRK2 G2019S iPSC-derived sensory neurons displayed altered calcium dynamics. Treatment with LRRK2 kinase inhibitors resulted in significant, but not complete, morphological and functional rescue. These data indicate a role for LRRK2 kinase activity in sensory neuron structure and function, which when disrupted, may lead to sensory neuron deficits in PD.

Abstract: Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with liver cholestatis. Toxic bile salt accumulation leads to chronic injury with mitochondrial damage, ROS increase and apoptosis, resulting in liver dysfunction. This study aimed to analyze mitochondrial bioenergetics in rats with hepatic fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) after BMMNC transplantation. Livers were collected from normal rats, fibrotic rats after 14 and 21 days of BDL (F14d and F21d) and rats that received BMMNC at 14 days of BDL, analyzed after 7 days. F21d demonstrated increased collagen I content and consequently decrease after BMMNC transplantation. Both F14d and F21d had significantly reduced mitochondrial oxidation capacity and increased mitochondrial uncoupling, which were restored to levels similar to those of normal group after BMMNC transplantation. In addition, F21d had a significantly increase of UCP2, and reduced PGC-1α content. However, after BMMNC transplantation both proteins returned to levels similar to normal group. Moreover, F14d had a significantly increase in 4-HNE content compared to normal group, but after BMMNC transplantation 4-HNE content significantly reduced, suggesting oxidative stress reduction. Therefore, BMMNC transplantation has a positive effect on hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetics of cholestatic rats, increasing oxidative capacity and reducing oxidative stress, which, in turn, contribute to liver function recover.

Abstract: Summary
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide an inexhaustible source of cells for modeling disease and testing drugs. Here we develop a bioinformatic approach to detect differences between the genomic programs of iPSCs derived from diseased versus normal human cohorts as they emerge during in vitro directed differentiation. Using iPSCs generated from a cohort carrying mutations (PiZZ) in the gene responsible for alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, we find that the global transcriptomes of PiZZ iPSCs diverge from normal controls upon differentiation to hepatic cells. Expression of 135 genes distinguishes PiZZ iPSC-hepatic cells, providing potential clues to liver disease pathogenesis. The disease-specific cells display intracellular accumulation of mutant AAT protein, resulting in increased autophagic flux. Furthermore, we detect beneficial responses to the drug carbamazepine, which further augments autophagic flux, but adverse responses to known hepatotoxic drugs. Our findings support the utility of iPSCs as tools for drug development or prediction of toxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Efficient differentiation of pluripotent cells to proximal and distal lung epithelial cell populations remains a challenging task. The 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold is a key component that regulates the interaction of secreted factors with cells during development by often binding to and limiting their diffusion within local gradients. Here we examined the role of the lung ECM in differentiation of pluripotent cells in vitro and demonstrate the robust inductive capacity of the native lung matrix alone. Extended culture of stem cell-derived definitive endoderm on decellularized lung scaffolds in defined, serum-free medium resulted in differentiation into mature airway epithelia, complete with ciliated cells, club cells, and basal cells with morphological and functional similarities to native airways. Heparitinase I, but not chondroitinase ABC, treatment of scaffolds revealed that the differentiation achieved is dependent on heparan sulfate proteoglycans and its bound factors remaining on decellularized scaffolds.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic regulation serves as the basis for stem cell differentiation into distinct cell types, but it is unclear how global epigenetic changes are regulated during this process. Here, we tested the hypothesis that global chromatin organization affects the lineage potential of stem cells and that manipulation of chromatin dynamics influences stem cell function. Using nuclease sensitivity assays, we found a progressive decrease in chromatin digestion among pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and mature hematopoietic cells. Quantitative high-resolution microscopy revealed that ESCs contain significantly more euchromatin than HSCs, with a further reduction in mature cells. Increased cellular maturation also led to heterochromatin localization to the nuclear periphery. Functionally, prevention of heterochromatin formation by inhibition of the histone methyltransferase G9A resulted in delayed HSC differentiation. Our results demonstrate global chromatin rearrangements during stem cell differentiation and that heterochromatin formation by H3K9 methylation regulates HSC differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic studies in Drosophila have demonstrated that generation of microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the NADPH dual oxidase (DUOX) is a first line of defense in the gut epithelia. Bacterial uracil acts as DUOX-activating ligand through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway modulates uracil-induced DUOX activation. Uracil-induced Hh signaling is required for intestinal expression of the calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule Cadherin 99C (Cad99C) and subsequent Cad99C-dependent formation of endosomes. These endosomes play essential roles in uracil-induced ROS production by acting as signaling platforms for PLCβ/PKC/Ca2+-dependent DUOX activation. Animals with impaired Hh signaling exhibit abolished Cad99C-dependent endosome formation and reduced DUOX activity, resulting in high mortality during enteric infection. Importantly, endosome formation, DUOX activation, and normal host survival are restored by genetic reintroduction of Cad99C into enterocytes, demonstrating the important role for Hh signaling in host resistance to enteric infection.

Abstract: Background
Increased expression of the tetraspanin TSPAN7 has been observed in a number of cancers; however, it is unclear how TSPAN7 plays a role in cancer progression.
Methods
We investigated the expression of TSPAN7 in the haematological malignancy multiple myleoma (MM) and assessed the consequences of TSPAN7 expression in the adhesion, migration and growth of MM plasma cells (PC) in vitro and in bone marrow (BM) homing and tumour growth in vivo. Finally, we characterised the association of TSPAN7 with cell surface partner molecules in vitro.
Results
TSPAN7 was found to be highly expressed at the RNA and protein level in CD138+ MM PC from approximately 50% of MM patients. TSPAN7 overexpression in the murine myeloma cell line 5TGM1 significantly reduced tumour burden in 5TGM1/KaLwRij mice 4 weeks after intravenous adminstration of 5TGM1 cells. While TSPAN7 overexpression did not affect cell proliferation in vitro, TSPAN7 increased 5TGM1 cell adhesion to BM stromal cells and transendothelial migration. In addition, TSPAN7 was found to associate with the molecular chaperone calnexin on the cell surface.
Conclusion
These results suggest that elevated TSPAN7 may be associated with better outcomes for up to 50% of MM patients.

Abstract: Cellular senescence of endothelial cells is a damage and stress response which induces pro-inflammatory, pro-atherosclerotic, and pro-thrombotic phenotypes. Donepezil is a drug used for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to investigate the attenuation of endothelial cell senescence by donepezil and to explore the mechanisms underlying the anti-aging effects of donepezil. Our results indicated that high glucose (HG) markedly decreased cell viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and this phenomenon was reversed by treatment with donepezil. Importantly, our results displayed that the frequency of senescent (SA-ß-gal-positive) cells and the expression level of senescence genes (PAI-1 and p21) were significantly higher in the HG group compared with the normal glucose (NG) group, and these changes were blocked by treatment with donepezil. Also, our results showed that donepezil inhibits the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promotes cellular senescence. Pretreatment with nicotinamide (NAM), a sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor, inhibited the reduction in senescence associated with donepezil. Indeed, our results indicated that donepezil increased the SIRT1 enzyme activity. Therefore, these results show that donepezil delays cellular senescence that is promoted under HG condition via activation of SIRT1.

Abstract: Micro(mi)RNAs play important and varied roles in tumorigenesis; however, the full repertoire of miRNAs that affect cancer cell growth is not known. In this study, an miRNA library was screened to identify those that affect the growth of A549 tumor cells. Among 300 miRNAs, miR-28-5p, -323-5p, -510-5p, -552-3p, and -608 were the most effective in inhibiting cell growth. More specifically, overexpressing miR-28-5p, -323-5p, and -510-5p induced G1 arrest, as determined by flow cytometry, whereas that of miR-608 induced cell death in a caspase-dependent manner. Moreover, several genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle progression were downregulated upon overexpression of each of the five miRNAs, with the functional targets of miR-552-3p and miR-608 confirmed by microarray, quantitative real-time PCR, and luciferase reporter assay. In miR-608-transfected cells, B cell lymphoma 2-like 1 (BCL2L1), D-type cyclin 1 (CCND1), CCND3, cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3), phosphoinositide 3-kinase regulatory subunit 2 (PIK3R2), specificity protein 1 (SP1), and phosphorylated Akt were all downregulated, while Bcl-2-interacting killer (BIK) was upregulated. Moreover, miR-608 was determined to have a suppressive function on tumor growth in an NCI-H460 xenograft model. These findings provide insights into the roles of five miRNAs in growth inhibition and their potential function as cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) targeted therapy has been explored for glioblastoma treatment. However, it is unclear which RTK inhibitors are the most effective and there are no predictive biomarkers available. We recently identified the RTK AXL as a putative target for the pan-RTK inhibitors cediranib and sunitinib, which are under clinical trials for glioblastoma patients. Here, we provide evidence that AXL activity can modulate sunitinib response in glioblastoma cell lines. We found that AXL knockdown conferred lower sensitivity to sunitinib by rescuing migratory defects and inhibiting apoptosis in cells expressing high AXL basal levels. Accordingly, overactivation of AXL by its ligand GAS6 rendered AXL positive glioblastoma cells more sensitive to sunitinib. AXL knockdown induced a cellular rewiring of several growth signaling pathways through activation of RTKs, such as EGFR, as well as intracellular pathways such as MAPK and AKT. The combination of sunitinib with a specific AKT inhibitor reverted the resistance of AXL-silenced cells to sunitinib. Together, our results suggest that sunitinib inhibits AXL and AXL activation status modulates therapy response of glioblastoma cells to sunitinib. Moreover, it indicates that combining sunitinib therapy with AKT pathway inhibitors could overcome sunitinib resistance.

Abstract: It has been proposed that the amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) cause the neuronal degeneration in the Alzheimer’s disease brain. An imbalance between peptide production at the neuronal level and their elimination across the blood–brain–barrier (BBB) results in peptide accumulation inside the brain. The identification and functional characterization of the transport systems in the BBB with the capacity to transport Aβ is crucial for the understanding of Aβ peptide traffic from the brain to the blood. In this context, it has been suggested that the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), expressed in endothelial cells of the BBB, plays a role in the elimination of Aβ. However, there is little, if any, experimental evidence to support this; therefore, the aim of this investigation was to determine whether P-gp is capable of transporting Aβ peptides. Our results show that ATPase activity measured in plasma membrane vesicles of K562 cells overexpressing P-gp is not increased by the presence of Aβ42, suggesting that Aβ42 is not a P-gp substrate. Similarly, P-gp of pirarubicin was unaffected by Aβ42. Moreover, the overexpression of P-gp does not protect cells against Aβ42 toxicity. Taken together, our results support the conclusion that Aβ42 is not transported by P-gp.

Abstract: Cholesterol plays an important role in inducing pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, characterized by an impaired insulin secretory response to glucose, representing a hallmark of the transition from pre-diabetes to diabetes. 3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (ES) is a scarcely studied microbiota-derived metabolite of quercetin with antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to determine the protective effect of ES against apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by cholesterol in Min6 pancreatic β-cells. Cholesterol decreased viability, induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing complex I activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP levels and oxygen consumption. Cholesterol promoted oxidative stress by increasing cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation and decreasing antioxidant enzyme activities; in addition, it slightly increased Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus. These events resulted in the impairment of the glucose-induced insulin secretion. ES increased Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus and protected pancreatic β-cells against impaired insulin secretion induced by cholesterol by preventing oxidative stress, apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Nrf2 activation seems to be involved in the mechanisms underlying the antioxidant protection exerted by ES in addition to preventing the disruption of antioxidant enzymatic defenses. Although additional in vivo experiments are required, this metabolite is suggested as a promising drug target for the prevention of the pathological development from a pre-diabetic to a diabetic state.

Abstract: Pirfenidone is an orally bioavailable synthetic compound with therapeutic potential for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It is thought to act through antioxidant and anti-fibrotic pathways. Pirfenidone inhibits proliferation and/or myofibroblast differentiation of a wide range of cell types, however, little studies have analyzed the effect of pirfenidone on the mesenchymal stem cells, which play an important role on the origin of myofibroblasts. We recently found that pirfenidone had anti-proliferative activity via G1 phase arrest and cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7) kinase expression decrease in transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-stimulated murine mesenchymal stem C3H10T1/2 cells. Pirfenidone also had inhibiting effect on the migration and α-SMA expression. Moreover, in this study we showed for the first time that Cdc7 inhibitor XL413 enhanced the anti-fibrotic activity of pirfenidone via depressed the expression of Smad2/4 proteins, and also prevented the nuclear accumulation and translocation of Smad2 protein. In conclusion, we demonstrated that pirfenidone inhibited proliferation, migration and differentiation of TGF-β1-stimulated C3H10T1/2 cells, which could be enhanced by Cdc7 inhibitor XL413, via Smad2/4. Combination with pirfenidone and XL413 might provide a potential candidate for the treatment of TGF-β1 associated fibrosis. It needs in vivo studies to further validate its therapeutic function and safety in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a leading cause of infection-associated mortality in immunocompromised individuals. Aspergillus fumigatus infection produces ligands that could activate inflammasomes, but the contribution of these host defenses remains unclear. We show that two inflammasome receptors, AIM2 and NLRP3, recognize intracellular A. fumigatus and collectively induce protective immune responses. Mice lacking both AIM2 and NLRP3 fail to confine Aspergillus hyphae to inflammatory foci, leading to widespread hyphal dissemination to lung blood vessels. These mice succumb to infection more rapidly than WT mice or mice lacking a single inflammasome receptor. AIM2 and NLRP3 activation initiates assembly of a single cytoplasmic inflammasome platform, composed of the adaptor protein ASC along with caspase-1 and caspase-8. Combined actions of caspase-1 and caspase-8 lead to processing of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 that critically control the infection. Thus, AIM2 and NLRP3 form a dual cytoplasmic surveillance system that orchestrates responses against A. fumigatus infection.

Abstract: A definitive cure for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) requires identifying novel therapeutic targets to eradicate leukemia stem cells (LSCs). However, the rarity of LSCs within the primitive hematopoietic cell compartment remains a major limiting factor for their study in humans. Here we show that primitive hematopoietic cells with typical LSC features, including adhesion defect, increased long-term survival and proliferation, and innate resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib, can be generated de novo from reprogrammed primary CML cells. Using CML iPSC-derived primitive leukemia cells, we discovered olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) as a novel factor that contributes to survival and growth of somatic lin−CD34+ cells from bone marrow of patients with CML in chronic phase, but not primitive hematopoietic cells from normal bone marrow. Overall, this study shows the feasibility and advantages of using reprogramming technology to develop strategies for targeting primitive leukemia cells.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell-derived somatic cells represent an unlimited resource for basic and translational science. Although promising, there are significant hurdles that must be overcome. Our focus is on the generation of the major cell type of the human liver, the hepatocyte. Current protocols produce variable populations of hepatocytes that are the product of using undefined components in the differentiation process. This serves as a significant barrier to scale-up and application. To tackle this issue, we designed a defined differentiation process using recombinant laminin substrates to provide instruction. We demonstrate efficient hepatocyte specification, cell organization, and significant improvements in cell function and phenotype. This is driven in part by the suppression of unfavorable gene regulatory networks that control cell proliferation and migration, pluripotent stem cell self-renewal, and fibroblast and colon specification. We believe that this represents a significant advance, moving stem cell-based hepatocytes closer toward biomedical application.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a potential source of chondrogenic cells for the treatment of cartilage disorders, but loss of chondrogenic potential during in vitro expansion and the propensity of cartilage to undergo hypertrophic maturation impede their therapeutic application. Here we report that the signaling protein WNT3A, in combination with FGF2, supports long-term expansion of human bone marrow-derived MSCs. The cells retained their chondrogenic potential and other phenotypic and functional properties of multipotent MSCs, which were gradually lost in the absence of WNT3A. Moreover, we discovered that endogenous WNT signals are the main drivers of the hypertrophic maturation that follows chondrogenic differentiation. Inhibition of WNT signals during differentiation prevented calcification and maintained cartilage properties following implantation in a mouse model. By maintaining potency during expansion and preventing hypertrophic maturation following differentiation, the modulation of WNT signaling removes two major obstacles that impede the clinical application of MSCs in cartilage repair.

Abstract: The acidic microenvironment around tumor cells is a major determinant in cancer growth, metabolism, and metastasis. However, its role in cancer physiology is still not clearly understood. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the effect of acidic environment on physiology of cancer cells. Exposure of Raji cells to extracellular acidic environment was associated with enhanced cytosolic calcium level and endoplasmic reticulum stress response. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) splicing, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), and glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) upregulation suggested endoplasmic reticulum stress generation. On the other hand, real-time-based upregulation of Bax gene expression and flow cytometric analysis of cytochrome c release as well as enhanced active caspase-3 further confirmed mitochondrion-mediated events leading to induction of apoptosis. The expression of TP53 and p21 was upregulated. These observations collectively strongly suggest that both endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated calcium release and Bax targeting might be altering mitochondrion membrane potential which in turn could induce secondary apoptotic signals; subsequently, endoplasmic reticulum stress can also lead to nuclear localization of Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) which in turn favors p53 mediated apoptotic signals.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury alters the signaling environment of the adult neurogenic niche and may activate unique proliferative cell populations that contribute to the post-injury neurogenic response. Runx1 is not normally expressed by adult neural stem or progenitor cells (NSPCs) but is induced in a subpopulation of putative NSPCs after brain injury in adult mice. In order to investigate the role of Runx1 in NSPCs, we established neurosphere cultures of adult mouse subventricular zone NSPCs. We show that Runx1 is basally expressed in neurosphere culture. Removal of the mitogen bFGF or addition of 1% FBS decreased Runx1 expression. Inhibition of endogenous Runx1 activity with either Ro5-3335 or shRNA-mediated Runx1 knockdown inhibited NSPC proliferation without affecting differentiation. Lentiviral mediated over-expression of Runx1 in neurospheres caused a significant change in cell morphology without reducing proliferation. Runx1-overexpressing neurospheres changed from floating spheres to adherent colonies or individual unipolar or bipolar cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that Runx1 over-expression produced a significant increase in expression of the neuronal marker TuJ1 and a minor increase in the astrocytic marker S100β. Thus, Runx1 expression drove adult NSPC differentiation, predominantly toward a neuronal lineage. These data suggest that Runx1 could be manipulated after injury to promote neuronal differentiation to facilitate repair of the CNS.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been extensively utilized for various cell therapeutic trials, but the signals regulating their stromal function remain largely unclear. Here, we show that canonical Wnt signals distinctively regulate MSCs in a biphasic manner depending on signal intensity, i.e., MSCs exhibit proliferation and progenitor self-renewal under low Wnt/β-catenin signaling, whereas they exhibit enhanced osteogenic differentiation with priming to osteoblast-like lineages under high Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, low or high levels of β-catenin in MSCs distinctly regulated the hematopoietic support of MSCs to promote proliferation or the undifferentiated state of hematopoietic progenitors, respectively. A gene expression study demonstrated that different intracellular levels of β-catenin in MSCs induce distinct transcriptomic changes in subsets of genes belonging to different gene function categories. Different β-catenin levels also induced differences in intracellular levels of the β-catenin co-factors, Tcf-1 and Lef-1. Moreover, nano-scale mass spectrometry of proteins that co-precipitated with β-catenin revealed distinctive spectra of proteins selectively interacting with β-catenin at specific expression levels. Together, these results show that Wnt/β-catenin signals can coax distinct transcription milieu to induce different transcription profiles in MSCs depending on the signal intensity and that fine-tuning of the canonical Wnt signaling intensity can regulate the phase-specific functionality of MSCs.

TMEM16A mediates the hypersecretion of mucus induced by Interleukin-13,

Abstract: Previous studies showed that the Ca2+-activated Cl− channel (CaCC) was involved in the pathogenesis of mucus hypersecretion induced by Interleukin-13 (IL-13). However, the mechanisms underlying the process were unknown. Recently, transmembrane protein 16A (TMEM16A) was identified as the channel underlying the CaCC current. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether the TMEM16A channel is part of the mechanism underlying IL-13-induced mucus hypersecretion. We observed that both TMEM16A mRNA and protein expression were significantly up-regulated after treatment with IL-13 in human bronchial epithelial 16 (HBE 16) cells, which correlated with an increase in mucus production. Additionally, mucus hypersecretion in rat airways was induced by intratracheal instillation of IL-13 and similar increases were observed in the expression of TMEM16A mRNA and protein in the bronchial epithelium. Niflumic acid (NA), a selective antagonist of CaCC, markedly blocked IL-13-induced mucin (MUC) 5AC mRNA and protein production in vivo and in vitro. Further investigation with HBE16 cells revealed that TMEM16A overexpression clearly promoted mucus production, IκBα phosphorylation, and p65 accumulation in the nucleus. The loss of TMEM16A resulted in inhibition of mucus production, and the TMEM16A-mediated production of MUC5AC was significantly blocked by a nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) inhibitor. Therefore, the TMEM16A channel acts upstream of NF-κB in the regulation of mucus production.

Abstract: According to the multifactorial model of cervical cancer (CC) causation, it is now recognized that other modifications, in addition to Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, are necessary for the development of this neoplasia. Among these, it has been proposed that a dysregulation of the WNT pathway might favor malignant progression of HPV-immortalized keratinocytes. The aim of this study was to identify components of the WNT pathway differentially expressed in CC vs. non-tumorigenic, but immortalized human keratinocytes. Interestingly, WNT7A expression was found strongly downregulated in cell lines and biopsies derived from CC. Restoration of WNT7A in CC-derived cell lines using a lentiviral gene delivery system or after adding a recombinant human protein decreases cell proliferation. Likewise, WNT7A silencing in non-tumorigenic cells markedly accelerates proliferation. Decreased WNT7A expression was due to hypermethylation at particular CpG sites. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting reduced WNT7A levels in CC-derived cells and that ectopic WNT7A restoration negatively affects cell proliferation and migration.

Abstract: Background
The objectives of this study are to investigate the expression of miR-126 and evaluate its effect on proliferation in undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma.
Methods
miR-126 expression of undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cell lines 8505C (BRAFV600E/V600E), BHT-101 (BRAFV600E/WT) and MB-1 (BRAFWT/WT) were quantified with q-PCR. These cell lines were transiently transfected with exogenous miR-126 (mimic). Following transfection, proliferation effects were observed through MTS proliferation assay and colony formation abilities. Immunofluorescence imaging and Western blot assay were also done to check target proteins expression.
Results
Under-expression (p<0.05) of miR-126 was noted in BRAFV600E mutated undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cells (8505C and BHT-101), but no change in expression was noted in non BRAFV600E mutated undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma cells (MB-1). In addition, a 30–50% drop in proliferation ability and a 35–45% reduction in colony formation capability were noticed in miR-126 mimic transfected group when compared to control group. Furthermore, immunofluorescence images showed reduced expression of p85β and p-AKT protein in miR-126 mimic transfected cells when compared to un-transfected cells. Also, Western blot analysis revealed a 34–40% suppression of p85β protein and a 21–53% drop in active AKT kinase (p-AKT) protein in miR-126 mimic transfected group when compared to control group.
Conclusions
Expression of miR-126 was down-regulated in BRAFV600E mutated undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. In addition, miR-126 was found to act as proliferation suppressor targeting PIK3R2 gene and reducing p85β (a regulatory subunit of PI3K kinase) protein translation and lower AKT kinase activity. Therefore, miR-126 could be a potential therapeutic tool in the treatment of undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma.

Abstract: Summary
Autosomal recessive osteopetrosis is a human bone disease mainly caused by TCIRG1 gene mutations that prevent osteoclasts resorbing activity, recapitulated by the oc/oc mouse model. Bone marrow transplantation is the only available treatment, limited by the need for a matched donor. The use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as an unlimited source of autologous cells to generate gene corrected osteoclasts might represent a powerful alternative. We generated iPSCs from oc/oc mice, corrected the mutation using a BAC carrying the entire Tcirg1 gene locus as a template for homologous recombination, and induced hematopoietic differentiation. Similarly to physiologic fetal hematopoiesis, iPSC-derived CD41+ cells gradually gave rise to CD45+ cells, which comprised both mature myeloid cells and high proliferative potential colony-forming cells. Finally, we differentiated the gene corrected iPSC-derived myeloid cells into osteoclasts with rescued bone resorbing activity. These results are promising for a future translation into the human clinical setting.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) treatments presently rely on analgesics, which manage pain but fail to restore imbalances between catabolic and anabolic processes that underlie OA pathogenesis. Recently, biologic (biotherapeutic) drugs, which alter the activity of catabolic agents such as nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines in ways, allowing tissue regeneration, were evaluated for efficacy in OA treatment. These studies failed to demonstrate dramatic abatement of OA symptoms by these drugs, but suggested strategies by which biologic agents might be used to treat OA. The present review summarizes current understanding of OA pathogenesis and evolving treatments. Preliminary evaluations of a novel biotherapeutic strategy are presented here. Twenty OA patients receiving sour topical cherry seed extract (SCE), an inducer of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a major physiological protectant against oxidative stress exhibited significantly decreased joint pain and activation of CD4+ T cells expressing inflammatory cytokines (p < 0.05), significantly decreased peripheral blood C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased leukocyte HO-1 (p < 0.05) in comparison with ten placebo-treated patients. SCE inhibits joint-damaging inflammatory mediator production. This agent therefore meets the main criterion for classification as a “biotherapeutic,” or “biologic” agent. The negligible toxicity and low cost of such materials make them promising contributors to OA treatment, sustainable within resource limitations of a wide range of patients.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are required for spermatogenesis. Earlier studies showed that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was indispensable for SSC self-renewal by binding to the GFRA1/RET receptor. Mice with mutations in these molecules showed impaired spermatogenesis, which was attributed to SSC depletion. Here we show that SSCs undergo GDNF-independent self-renewal. A small number of spermatogonia formed colonies when testis fragments from a Ret mutant mouse strain were transplanted into heterologous recipients. Moreover, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) supplementation enabled in vitro SSC expansion without GDNF. Although GDNF-mediated self-renewal signaling required both AKT and MAP2K1/2, the latter was dispensable in FGF2-mediated self-renewal. FGF2-depleted testes exhibited increased levels of GDNF and were enriched for SSCs, suggesting that the balance between FGF2 and GDNF levels influences SSC self-renewal in vivo. Our results show that SSCs exhibit at least two modes of self-renewal and suggest complexity of SSC regulation in vivo.

Abstract: Microglia play an important role in neuronal protection and damage. However, the molecular and cellular relationship between microglia and neurons is unclear. We carried out a prospective study to detect that activation of BV2 microglia induced PC12 cell apoptosis in vitro through the TLR4/adapter protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. BV2 microglia were treated with different concentrations of LPS for 24 h. Western blot was utilized to detect the expression of TLR4 and the downstream signaling pathway. The level of inflammatory mediator was quantified using a specific ELISA kit. The supernatant of 10 μg/ml LPS-treated BV2 cells was used as conditioned medium (CM). PC12 cells were co-culture with CM for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay and cell apoptosis was tested by flow cytometry. BV2 microglia were treated with 10, 20, or 30 μg/ml LPS for 24 h. The expression of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB significantly increased. When PC12 cells were co-cultured with CM for 24 h, cell viability decreased. CM up-regulated the Bax level and down-regulated the Bcl-2 protein level in PC12 cells. PC12 cells pretreated with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) for 30 min, significantly alleviated CM-induced PC12 cell apoptosis. These results suggest that BV2 microglia activated by LPS triggered TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway that induced the release of IL-1β and could participate in the PC12 cells injury.

Abstract: Cancer cells typically exhibit increased glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and they continue to exhibit some elevation in glycolysis even under aerobic conditions. However, it is unclear whether cancer cell lines employ a high level of glycolysis comparable to that of the original cancers from which they were derived, even if their culture conditions are changed to physiologically relevant oxygen concentrations. From three childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients we established three new pairs of cell lines in both atmospheric (20%) and physiologic (bone marrow level, 5%) oxygen concentrations. Cell lines established in 20% oxygen exhibited lower proliferation, survival, expression of glycolysis genes, glucose consumption, and lactate production. Interestingly, the effects of oxygen concentration used during cell line initiation were only partially reversible when established cell cultures were switched from one oxygen concentration to another for eight weeks. These observations indicate that ALL cell lines established at atmospheric oxygen concentration can exhibit relatively low levels of glycolysis and these levels are semi-permanent, suggesting that physiologic oxygen concentrations may be needed from the time of cell line initiation to preserve the high level of glycolysis commonly exhibited by leukemias in vivo.

Abstract: Human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs, also loosely called bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) are the subject of increasing numbers of clinical trials and laboratory research. Our group recently reported on the optimization of a workflow for a sensitive proteomic study of hBMSCs. Here, we couple this workflow with a label-free protein quantitation method to investigate the molecular responses of hBMSCs to long-term in vitro passaging. We explored the proteomic responses of hBMSCs by assessing the expression levels of proteins at early passage (passage 3, P3) and late passage (P7). We used multiple biological as well as technical replicates to ensure that the detected proteomic changes are repeatable between cultures and thus likely to be biologically relevant. Over 1700 proteins were quantified at three passages and a list of differentially expressed proteins was compiled. Bioinformatics-based network analysis and term enrichment revealed that metabolic pathways are largely altered, where many proteins in the glycolytic, pentose phosphate, and TCA pathways were shown to be largely upregulated in late passages. We also observed significant proteomic alterations in functional categories including apoptosis, and ER-based protein processing and sorting following in vitro cell aging. We posit that the comprehensive map outlined in this report of affected phenotypes as well as the underpinning molecular factors tremendously benefit the effort to uncovering targets that are not just used only to monitor cell fitness but can be employed to slowdown the in vitro aging process in hBMSCs and hence ensure manufacturing of cells with known quality, efficacy and stability.

Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a sustained blockage of the airways due to lung inflammation occurring with chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. Progression of emphysema may be slowed by vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), which reduces apoptotic tissue depletion. Previously, authors of the present report demonstrated that cis-resveratrol (c-RSV)-induced heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) promoter-regulated VEGFA expression promoted neovascularization of genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells (HSP-VEGFA-MSC) in a mouse model of ischemic disease. Here, this same stem cell line was evaluated for its protective capacity to alleviate elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema in mice. Results of this study showed that c-RSV-treatment of HSP-VEGFA-MSC exhibited synergy between HSP70 transcription activity and induced expression of anti-oxidant-related genes when challenged by cigarette smoke extracts. Eight weeks after jugular vein injection of HSP-VEGFA-MSC into mice with elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema followed by c-RSV treatment to induce transgene expression, significant improvement was observed in respiratory functions. Expression of VEGFA, endogenous nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf 2), and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) was significantly increased in the lung tissues of the c-RSV-treated mice. Histopathologic examination of treated mice revealed gradual but significant abatement of emphysema and restoration of airspace volume. In conclusion, the present investigation demonstrates that c-RSV-regulated VEGFA expression in HSP-VEGFA-MSC significantly improved the therapeutic effects on the treatment of COPD in the mouse, possibly avoiding side effects associated with constitutive VEGFA expression.

Abstract: Summary
Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan pathogen in the phylum Apicomplexa that resides within an intracellular parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that is selectively permeable to small molecules through unidentified mechanisms. We have identified GRA17 as a Toxoplasma-secreted protein that localizes to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) and mediates passive transport of small molecules across the PVM. GRA17 is related to the putative Plasmodium translocon protein EXP2 and conserved across PV-residing Apicomplexa. The PVs of GRA17-deficient parasites have aberrant morphology, reduced permeability to small molecules, and structural instability. GRA17-deficient parasites proliferate slowly and are avirulent in mice. These GRA17-deficient phenotypes are rescued by complementation with Plasmodium EXP2. GRA17 functions synergistically with a related protein, GRA23. Exogenous expression of GRA17 or GRA23 alters the membrane conductance properties of Xenopus oocytes in a manner consistent with a large non-selective pore. Thus, GRA17 and GRA23 provide a molecular basis for PVM permeability and nutrient access.

Abstract: The development of fin primary cell cultures for in vitro cellular and physiological studies is hampered by slow cell outgrowth, low proliferation rate, poor viability, and sparse cell characterization. Here, we investigated whether the recycling of fresh explants after a first conventional culture could improve physiological stability and sustainability of the culture. The recycled explants were able to give a supplementary cell culture showing faster outgrowth, cleaner cell layers and higher net cell production. The cells exhibited a highly stabilized profile for marker gene expression including a low cytokeratin 49 (epithelial marker) and a high collagen 1a1 (mesenchymal marker) expression. Added to the cell spindle-shaped morphology, motility behavior, and actin organization, this suggests that the cells bore stable mesenchymal characteristics. This contrast with the time-evolving expression pattern observed in the control fresh explants during the first 2 weeks of culture: a sharp decrease in cytokeratin 49 expression was concomitant with a gradual increase in col1a1. We surmise that such loss of epithelial features for the benefit of mesenchymal ones was triggered by an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process or by way of a progressive population replacement process. Overall, our findings provide a comprehensive characterization of this new primary culture model bearing mesenchymal features and whose stability over culture time makes those cells good candidates for cell reprogramming prior to nuclear transfer, in a context of fish genome preservation.

Abstract: Summary
Antigenic diversity has posed a critical barrier to vaccine development against the pathogenic blood-stage infection of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. To date, only strain-specific protection has been reported by trials of such vaccines in nonhuman primates. We recently showed that P. falciparum reticulocyte binding protein homolog 5 (PfRH5), a merozoite adhesin required for erythrocyte invasion, is highly susceptible to vaccine-inducible strain-transcending parasite-neutralizing antibody. In vivo efficacy of PfRH5-based vaccines has not previously been evaluated. Here, we demonstrate that PfRH5-based vaccines can protect Aotus monkeys against a virulent vaccine-heterologous P. falciparum challenge and show that such protection can be achieved by a human-compatible vaccine formulation. Protection was associated with anti-PfRH5 antibody concentration and in vitro parasite-neutralizing activity, supporting the use of this in vitro assay to predict the in vivo efficacy of future vaccine candidates. These data suggest that PfRH5-based vaccines have potential to achieve strain-transcending efficacy in humans.

Abstract: Summary
The SAMHD1 triphosphohydrolase inhibits HIV-1 infection of myeloid and resting T cells by depleting dNTPs. To overcome SAMHD1, HIV-2 and some SIVs encode either of two lineages of the accessory protein Vpx that bind the SAMHD1 N or C terminus and redirect the host cullin-4 ubiquitin ligase to target SAMHD1 for proteasomal degradation. We present the ternary complex of Vpx from SIV that infects mandrills (SIVmnd-2) with the cullin-4 substrate receptor, DCAF1, and N-terminal and SAM domains from mandrill SAMHD1. The structure reveals details of Vpx lineage-specific targeting of SAMHD1 N-terminal “degron” sequences. Comparison with Vpx from SIV that infects sooty mangabeys (SIVsmm) complexed with SAMHD1-DCAF1 identifies molecular determinants directing Vpx lineages to N- or C-terminal SAMHD1 sequences. Inspection of the Vpx-DCAF1 interface also reveals conservation of Vpx with the evolutionally related HIV-1/SIV accessory protein Vpr. These data suggest a unified model for how Vpx and Vpr exploit DCAF1 to promote viral replication.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal progenitor cells have great therapeutic potential, yet incomplete characterization of their cell-surface interface limits their clinical exploitation. We have employed subcellular fractionation with quantitative discovery proteomics to define the cell-surface interface proteome of human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) and human umbilical cord perivascular cells (HUCPVCs). We compared cell-surface-enriched fractions from MSCs and HUCPVCs (three donors each) with adult mesenchymal fibroblasts using eight-channel isobaric-tagging mass spectrometry, yielding relative quantification on >6,000 proteins with high confidence. This approach identified 186 upregulated mesenchymal progenitor biomarkers. Validation of 10 of these markers, including ROR2, EPHA2, and PLXNA2, confirmed upregulated expression in mesenchymal progenitor populations and distinct roles in progenitor cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Our approach has delivered a cell-surface proteome repository that now enables improved selection and characterization of human mesenchymal progenitor populations.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the use of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in clinical therapy for over half a century, the mechanisms that regulate HSC trafficking, engraftment, and life-long persistence after transplantation are unclear. Here, we show that the vascular endothelium regulates HSC trafficking into and out of bone marrow (BM) niches. Surprisingly, we found that instead of acting as barriers to cellular entry, vascular endothelial cells, via the guidance molecule ROBO4, actively promote HSC translocation across vessel walls into the BM space. In contrast, we found that the vasculature inhibits the reverse process, as induced vascular permeability led to a rapid increase in HSCs in the blood stream. Thus, the vascular endothelium reinforces HSC localization to BM niches both by promoting HSC extravasation from blood-to-BM and by forming vascular barriers that prevent BM-to-blood escape. Our results uncouple the mechanisms that regulate the directionality of HSC trafficking and show that the vasculature can be targeted to improve hematopoietic transplantation therapies.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle stem cells named muscle satellite cells are normally quiescent but are activated in response to various stimuli, such as injury and overload. Activated satellite cells enter the cell cycle and proliferate to produce a large number of myogenic progenitor cells, and these cells then differentiate and fuse to form myofibers. Zinc is one of the essential elements in the human body, and has multiple roles, including cell growth and DNA synthesis. However, the role of zinc in myogenic cells is not well understood, and is the focus of this study. We first examined the effects of zinc on differentiation of murine C2C12 myoblasts and found that zinc promoted proliferation, with an increased number of cells incorporating EdU, but inhibited differentiation with reduced myogenin expression and myotube formation. Furthermore, we used the C2C12 reserve cell model of myogenic quiescence to investigate the role of zinc on activation of myogenic cells. The number of reserve cells incorporating BrdU was increased by zinc in a dose dependent manner, with the number dramatically further increased using a combination of zinc and insulin. Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are downstream of insulin signaling, and both were phosphorylated after zinc treatment. The zinc/insulin combination-induced activation involved the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and ERK cascade. We conclude that zinc promotes activation and proliferation of myogenic cells, and this activation requires phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and ERK as part of the signaling cascade.

Abstract: Summary
Here we report the successful generation and long-term expansion of SOX9-expressing CD271+PDGFRα+CD73+ chondrogenic ectomesenchymal cells from the PAX3/SOX10/FOXD3-expressing MIXL1−CD271hiPDGFRαloCD73− neural crest-like progeny of human pluripotent stem cells in a chemically defined medium supplemented with Nodal/Activin/transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ) inhibitor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). When “primed” with TGFβ, such cells efficiently formed translucent cartilage particles, which were completely mineralized in 12 weeks in immunocompromized mice. The ectomesenchymal cells were expandable without loss of chondrogenic potential for at least 16 passages. They maintained normal karyotype for at least 10 passages and expressed genes representing embryonic progenitors (SOX4/12, LIN28A/B), cranial mesenchyme (ALX1/3/4), and chondroprogenitors (SOX9, COL2A1) of neural crest origin (SOX8/9, NGFR, NES). Ectomesenchyme is a source of many craniofacial bone and cartilage structures. The method we describe for obtaining a large quantity of human ectomesenchymal cells will help to model craniofacial disorders in vitro and potentially provide cells for the repair of craniofacial damage.

Abstract: Summary
miR-302/367 is the most abundant miRNA cluster in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and can promote somatic cell reprogramming. However, its role in hESCs remains poorly understood. Here, we studied functional roles of the endogenous miR-302/367 cluster in hESCs by employing specific TALE-based transcriptional repressors. We revealed that miR-302/367 cluster dually regulates hESC cell cycle and apoptosis in dose-dependent manner. Gene profiling and functional studies identified key targets of the miR-302/367 cluster in regulating hESC self-renewal and apoptosis. We demonstrate that in addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, miR-302/367 cluster conquers apoptosis by downregulating BNIP3L/Nix (a BH3-only proapoptotic factor) and upregulating BCL-xL expression. Furthermore, we show that butyrate, a natural compound, upregulates miR-302/367 cluster expression and alleviates hESCs from apoptosis induced by knockdown of miR-302/367 cluster. In summary, our findings provide new insights in molecular mechanisms of how miR-302/367 cluster regulates hESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Salmonella invasion of intestinal epithelial cells requires extensive, though transient, actin modifications at the site of bacterial entry. The actin-modifying protein villin is present in the brush border where it participates in the constitution of microvilli and in epithelial restitution after damage through its actin-severing activity. We investigated a possible role for villin in Salmonella invasion. The absence of villin, which is normally located at the bacterial entry site, leads to a decrease in Salmonella invasion. Villin is necessary for early membrane-associated processes and for optimal ruffle assembly by balancing the steady-state level of actin. The severing activity of villin is important for Salmonella invasion in vivo. The bacterial phosphatase SptP tightly regulates villin phosphorylation, while the actin-binding effector SipA protects F-actin and counterbalances villin-severing activity. Thus, villin plays an important role in establishing the balance between actin polymerization and actin severing to facilitate the initial steps of Salmonella entry.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation is a promising strategy for delivering therapeutic proteins in the brain. We evaluated a complete process of ex vivo gene therapy using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NSC transplants in a well-characterized mouse model of a human lysosomal storage disease, Sly disease. Human Sly disease fibroblasts were reprogrammed into iPSCs, differentiated into a stable and expandable population of NSCs, genetically corrected with a transposon vector, and assessed for engraftment in NOD/SCID mice. Following neonatal intraventricular transplantation, the NSCs engraft along the rostrocaudal axis of the CNS primarily within white matter tracts and survive for at least 4 months. Genetically corrected iPSC-NSCs transplanted post-symptomatically into the striatum of adult Sly disease mice reversed neuropathology in a zone surrounding the grafts, while control mock-corrected grafts did not. The results demonstrate the potential for ex vivo gene therapy in the brain using human NSCs from autologous, non-neural tissues.

Abstract: A loss of salivary gland function often occurs after radiation therapy in head and neck tumors, though secretion of saliva by the salivary glands is essential for the health and maintenance of the oral environment. Transplantation of salivary acinar cells (ACs), in part, may overcome the side effects of therapy. Here we directly differentiated mouse adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) into ACs using a co-culture system. Multipotent ADSCs can be easily collected from stromal vascular fractions of adipose tissues. The isolated ADSCs showed positive expression of markers such as integrin beta-1 (CD29), cell surface glycoprotein (CD44), endoglin (CD105), and Nanog. The cells were able to differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and neural-like cells after 14days in culture. ADSCs at passage 2 were co-cultured with mouse ACs in AC culture medium using the double-chamber (co-culture system) to avoid mixing the cell types. The ADSCs in this co-culture system expressed markers of ACs, such as α-amylases and aquaporin5, in both mRNA and protein. ADSCs cultured in AC-conditioned medium also expressed AC markers. Cellular proliferation and senescence analyses demonstrated that cells in the co-culture group showed lower senescence and a higher proliferation rate than the AC-conditioned medium group at Days 14 and 21. The results above imply direct conversion of ADSCs into ACs under the co-culture system; therefore, ADSCs may be a stem cell source for the therapy for salivary gland damage.

Abstract: Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is widely used to establish and maintain naïve pluripotent stem cells, including mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Although the combination of chemical inhibitors called 2i can establish mouse iPSCs without LIF from primed pluripotent stem cells, it has been difficult, if not impossible, to establish mouse iPSCs from differentiated somatic cells without LIF. We previously showed that the fusion gene of the transactivation domain of MyoD and the full-length Oct4 (M3O) increases the efficiency of making iPSCs when transduced into fibroblasts along with Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (M3O-SKM). Here, we report that M3O-SKM allows for establishment of iPSCs without exogenous LIF from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The established iPSCs remained undifferentiated and maintained pluripotency over 90days without LIF as long as M3O was expressed. The iPSCs upregulated miR-205-5p, which was potentially involved in the LIF-independence by suppressing the two signaling pathways inhibited by 2i. The result indicates that potentiated Oct4 can substitute for the LIF signaling pathway, providing a novel model to link Oct4 and LIF, two of the most significant players in naïve pluripotency.

Abstract: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a specialized stromal cytotype have a great impact on the biological behaviors of liver diseases. Despite this fact, the underlying mechanism that regulates HSC still remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to understand the role of TRPC6 signaling in regulating the molecular mechanism of HSCs in response to hypoxia. In the present study we showed that under hypoxia condition, the upregulated Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α (HIF1α) increases NICD activation, which in turn induces the expression of transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6) in HSC line lx-2. TRPC6 causes a sustained elevation of intracellular calcium which is coupled with the activation of the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) pathway which activates the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. TRPC6 also activates SMAD2/3 dependent TGF-β signaling in facilitating upregulated expression of αSMA and collagen. As activated HSCs may be a suitable target for HCC therapy and targeting these cells rather than the HCC cells may result in a greater response. Collectively, our studies indicate for the first time the detailed mechanism of activation of HSC through TRPC6 signaling and thus being a promising therapeutic target.

Abstract: Cytokine-induced antiapoptotic inhibitor 1 (CIAPIN1) was recently identified as an essential downstream effector of the Ras signaling pathway and has been confirmed to be closely associated with various malignant tumors. However, its potential role in regulating breast cancer metastasis remains unclear. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a broad family of zinc-biding endopeptidases that participate in the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation that accompanies cancer cell invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. In this study, we found up-regulation of CIAPIN1 by lentiviral expression vector inhibited the migration, invasion and MMPs expression of MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, CIAPIN1 over-expression decreased NHE1 (Na+/H+ exchanger 1) expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Importantly, treating CIAPIN1 over-expressed MDA-MB-231 cells with the NHE1 specific inhibitor, Cariporide, further inhibited the metastatic capacity, MMPs expression and phosphorylated ERK1/2. Treatment with the MEK1 specific inhibitor, PD98059, induced nearly the same suppression of CIAPIN1 over-expression-dependent migration, invasion and MMPs expression as was observed with Cariporide. Further, Cariporide and PD98059 synergistically suppressed migration, invasion and MMPs expression of CIAPIN1 over-expressed MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, our results revealed the mechanism by which CIAPIN1 targeted NHE1 to mediate migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through regulation of MMPs via ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Neural stem cells (NSCs) have been considered as potential therapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but their use is hampered by the poor survival of grafted cells. Supply of neurotrophic factors to the grafted cells has been proposed as a way to augment survival of the stem cells. In this context, we investigated the utility of Cerebrolysin (CBL), a peptidergic mixture with neurotrophic-like properties, as an adjunct to stem cell therapy in an APP transgenic (tg) model of AD. We grafted murine NSCs into the hippocampus of non-tg and APP tg that were treated systemically with CBL and analyzed after 1, 3, 6 and 9months post grafting. Compared to vehicle-treated non-tg mice, in the vehicle-treated APP tg mice there was considerable reduction in the survival of the grafted NSCs. Whereas, CBL treatment enhanced the survival of NSCs in both non-tg and APP tg with the majority of the surviving NSCs remaining as neuroblasts. The NSCs of the CBL treated mice displayed reduced numbers of caspase-3 and TUNEL positive cells and increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and furin immunoreactivity. These results suggest that CBL might protect grafted NSCs and as such be a potential adjuvant therapy when combined with grafting.

Abstract: Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is one of the most important transcriptional molecules in the heat shock process; however, HSF1 can also regulate the expression of other proteins. Dystrophin Dp71 is one of the most widely expressed isoforms of the dystrophin gene family. In our experiments, we showed for the first time that HSF1 can function as a transcriptional factor for endogenous Dp71 expression in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrated that the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of Dp71 were significantly reduced in HSF1-knockout mice compared with wild-type mice in brain, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney. Overexpression of HSF1 significantly enhanced the mRNA and protein expression of Dp71 in HeLa cells. Inhibiting the expression of HSF1 in HeLa cells significantly reduced the expression of Dp71. By use of the EMSA technique, the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and the luciferase reporter system, we demonstrated that HSF1 can directly bind the HSE in the Dp71 promoter region. We concluded from our data that HSF1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of Dp71 expression.

Abstract: Podoplanin (PDPN) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that promotes tumor cell migration, invasion, and cancer metastasis. In fact, PDPN expression is induced in many types of cancer. Thus, PDPN has emerged as a functionally relevant cancer biomarker and chemotherapeutic target. PDPN contains 2 intracellular serine residues that are conserved between species ranging from mouse to humans. Recent studies indicate that protein kinase A (PKA) can phosphorylate PDPN in order to inhibit cell migration. However, the number and identification of specific residues phosphorylated by PKA have not been defined. In addition, roles of other kinases that may phosphorylate PDPN to control cell migration have not been investigated. We report here that cyclin dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) can phosphorylate PDPN in addition to PKA. Moreover, results from this study indicate that PKA and CDK5 cooperate to phosphorylate PDPN on both intracellular serine residues to decrease cell motility. These results provide new insight into PDPN phosphorylation dynamics and the role of PDPN in cell motility. Understanding novel mechanisms of PDPN intracellular signaling could assist with designing novel targeted chemotherapeutic agents and procedures.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical biology methods such as high-throughput screening (HTS) and affinity-based target identification can be used to probe biological systems on a biomacromolecule level, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of those systems. Here, by establishing a human embryonal carcinoma cell-based HTS platform, we screened 171,077 small molecules for regulators of pluripotency and identified a small molecule, Displurigen, that potently disrupts hESC pluripotency by targeting heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 (HSPA8), the constitutively expressed member of the 70-kDa heat shock protein family, as elucidated using affinity-based target identification techniques and confirmed by loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays. We demonstrated that HSPA8 maintains pluripotency by binding to the master pluripotency regulator OCT4 and facilitating its DNA-binding activity.

Abstract: Summary
The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria is an asymmetric lipid bilayer that serves as a barrier to the environment. During infection, Gram-negative bacteria remodel their OM to promote survival and replication within host tissues. Salmonella rely on the PhoPQ two-component regulators to coordinate OM remodeling in response to environmental cues. In a screen for mediators of PhoPQ-regulated OM remodeling in Salmonella Typhimurium, we identified PbgA, a periplasmic domain-containing transmembrane protein, which binds cardiolipin glycerophospholipids near the inner membrane and promotes their PhoPQ-regulated trafficking to the OM. Purified-PbgA oligomers are tetrameric, and the periplasmic domain contains a globular region that binds to the OM in a PhoPQ-dependent manner. Thus, PbgA forms a complex that may bridge the envelope for regulated cardiolipin delivery. PbgA globular region-deleted mutant bacteria are severely attenuated for pathogenesis, suggesting that increased cardiolipin trafficking to the OM is necessary for Salmonella to survive within host tissues that activate PhoPQ.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms underlying age-related defects within lymphoid-lineages remain poorly understood. We previously reported that sex steroid ablation (SSA) induced lymphoid rejuvenation and enhanced recovery from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT). We herein show that, mechanistically, SSA induces hematopoietic and lymphoid recovery by functionally enhancing both HSC self-renewal and propensity for lymphoid differentiation through intrinsic molecular changes. Our transcriptome analysis revealed further hematopoietic support through rejuvenation of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, with upregulation of key hematopoietic factors and master regulatory factors associated with aging such as Foxo1. These studies provide important cellular and molecular insights into understanding how SSA-induced regeneration of the hematopoietic compartment can underpin recovery of the immune system following damaging cytoablative treatments. These findings support a short-term strategy for clinical use of SSA to enhance the production of lymphoid cells and HSC engraftment, leading to improved outcomes in adult patients undergoing HSCT and immune depletion in general.

Abstract: Summary
In response to tissue injury, hyaluronan (HA) polymers are cleaved by host hyaluronidases, generating small fragments that ligate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to elicit inflammatory responses. Pathogenic bacteria such as group B Streptococcus (GBS) express and secrete hyaluronidases as a mechanism for tissue invasion, but it is not known how this activity relates to immune detection of HA. We found that bacterial hyaluronidases secreted by GBS and other Gram-positive pathogens degrade pro-inflammatory HA fragments to their component disaccharides. In addition, HA disaccharides block TLR2/4 signaling elicited by both host-derived HA fragments and other TLR2/4 ligands, including lipopolysaccharide. Application of GBS hyaluronidase or HA disaccharides reduced pulmonary pathology and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in an acute lung injury model. We conclude that breakdown of host-generated pro-inflammatory HA fragments to disaccharides allows bacterial pathogens to evade immune detection and could be exploited as a strategy to treat inflammatory diseases.
