Abstract: Human class I homeobox A13 (HOXA13) was initially identified as a transcription factor and has an important role in embryonic development and malignant transformation. However, the clinical significance and the molecular mechanisms of HOXA13 in colon cancer development and progression are still unknown. In this study, we found that HOXA13 was highly expressed in colon cancer tissues, and its expression was associated with histological grade, T stage, N stage and tumour size. In vitro studies showed that HOXA13 promoted colon cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that HOXA13 expression was positively correlated with the WNT signalling pathway. In vitro studies showed that HOXA13 promoted the malignant phenotype of colon cancer cells by facilitating the nuclear translocation of β-Catenin. Moreover, XAV939, an inhibitor of β-Catenin, reversed the HOXA13-mediated effects on invasion and proliferation of colon cancer cells. In vivo studies further verified that HOXA13 promoted tumour formation through the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway. Collectively, these results suggest that HOXA13 is a potential oncogene that functions by promoting the nuclear translocation of β-Catenin, thereby maintaining the proliferation and metastasis of colon cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) readily differentiate to somatic or germ lineages but have impaired ability to form extra-embryonic lineages such as placenta or yolk sac. Here, we demonstrate that naive hESCs can be converted into cells that exhibit the cellular and molecular phenotypes of human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) derived from human placenta or blastocyst. The resulting “transdifferentiated” hTSCs show reactivation of core placental genes, acquisition of a placenta-like methylome, and the ability to differentiate to extravillous trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Modest differences are observed between transdifferentiated and placental hTSCs, most notably in the expression of certain imprinted loci. These results suggest that naive hESCs can differentiate to extra-embryonic lineage and demonstrate a new way of modeling human trophoblast specification and placental methylome establishment.

Abstract: Summary
Muscle satellite cells are normally quiescent but are rapidly activated following muscle damage. Here, we investigated whether damaged myofibers influence the activation of satellite cells. Our findings revealed that satellite cells are directly activated by damaged-myofiber-derived factors (DMDFs). DMDFs induced satellite cells to enter the cell cycle; however, the cells stayed at the G1 phase and did not undergo S phase, and these cells were reversible to the quiescent-like state. Proteome analysis identified metabolic enzymes, including GAPDH, as DMDFs, whose recombinant proteins stimulated the activation of satellite cells. Satellite cells pre-exposed to the DMDFs demonstrated accelerated proliferation ex vivo. Treatment with recombinant GAPDH prior to muscle injury promoted expansion of the satellite cell population in vivo. Thus, our results indicate that DMDFs are not only a set of biomarkers for muscle damage, but also act as moonlighting proteins involved in satellite cell activation at the initial step of muscle regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Muscle stem cells (or muscle satellite cells [MuSCs]) are required for postnatal growth. Yet, the detailed characterization of myogenic progression and establishment of quiescence during this process remains poorly documented. Here, we provide an overview of myogenic cells heterogeneity and dynamic from birth to adulthood using flow cytometry. We demonstrated that PAX7+ cells acquire an increasing ability to progress in the myogenic program from birth to adulthood. We then simultaneously analyzed the cycling state (KI67 expression) of the MuSCs and progenitors (PAX7+) and their progression into myogenic precursors (PAX7−MYOD+) and differentiating cells (MYOG+) in vivo. We identified two distinct peaks of myogenic differentiation between P7–P10 and P21–P28, and showed that the quiescent MuSC pool is established between 7 and 8 weeks of age. Overall our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterization of myogenic heterogeneity and demonstrates the highly dynamic nature of skeletal muscle postnatal growth process.

Abstract: Summary
Direct cardiac reprogramming holds great potential for regenerative medicine. However, it remains inefficient, and induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) generated in vitro are less mature than those in vivo, suggesting that undefined extrinsic factors may regulate cardiac reprogramming. Previous in vitro studies mainly used hard polystyrene dishes, yet the effect of substrate rigidity on cardiac reprogramming remains unclear. Thus, we developed a Matrigel-based hydrogel culture system to determine the roles of matrix stiffness and mechanotransduction in cardiac reprogramming. We found that soft matrix comparable with native myocardium promoted the efficiency and quality of cardiac reprogramming. Mechanistically, soft matrix enhanced cardiac reprogramming via inhibition of integrin, Rho/ROCK, actomyosin, and YAP/TAZ signaling and suppression of fibroblast programs, which were activated on rigid substrates. Soft substrate further enhanced cardiac reprogramming with Sendai virus vectors via YAP/TAZ suppression, increasing the reprogramming efficiency up to ∼15%. Thus, mechanotransduction could provide new targets for improving cardiac reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Mosquito inoculation of humans with arthritogenic alphaviruses results in a febrile syndrome characterized by debilitating musculoskeletal pain and arthritis. Despite an expanding global disease burden, no approved therapies or licensed vaccines exist. Here, we describe human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to and neutralize multiple distantly related alphaviruses. These mAbs compete for an antigenic site and prevent attachment to the recently discovered Mxra8 alphavirus receptor. Three cryoelectron microscopy structures of Fab in complex with Ross River (RRV), Mayaro, or chikungunya viruses reveal a conserved footprint of the broadly neutralizing mAb RRV-12 in a region of the E2 glycoprotein B domain. This mAb neutralizes virus in vitro by preventing virus entry and spread and is protective in vivo in mouse models. Thus, the RRV-12 mAb and its defined epitope have potential as a therapeutic agent or target of vaccine design against multiple emerging arthritogenic alphavirus infections.

Abstract: Fatty acid–binding proteins (FABPs) are lipid chaperones assisting in the trafficking of long-chain fatty acids with functions in various cell compartments, including oxidation, signaling, gene-transcription regulation, and storage. The various known FABP isoforms display distinctive tissue distribution, but some are active in more than one tissue. Quantitative and/or qualitative changes of FABPs are associated with pathological conditions. Increased circulating levels of FABPs are biomarkers of disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Deregulated expression and malfunction of FABPs can result from genetic alterations or posttranslational modifications and can be pathogenic. We have assembled the disorders with abnormal FABPs as chaperonopathies in a distinct nosological entity. This entity is similar but separate from that encompassing the chaperonopathies pertaining to protein chaperones. In this review, we discuss the role of FABPs in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, cancer, and neurological diseases. We highlight the opportunities for improving diagnosis and treatment that open by encompassing all these pathological conditions within of a coherent nosological group, focusing on abnormal lipid chaperones as biomarkers of disease and etiological-pathogenic factors.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR/Cas9 is a promising technology for gene correction. However, the edition is often biallelic, and uncontrolled small insertions and deletions (indels) concomitant to precise correction are created. Mutation-specific guide RNAs were recently tested to correct dominant inherited diseases, sparing the wild-type allele. We tested an original approach to correct compound heterozygous recessive mutations. We compared editing efficiency and genotoxicity by biallelic guide RNA versus mutant allele-specific guide RNA in iPSCs derived from a congenital erythropoietic porphyria patient carrying compound heterozygous mutations resulting in UROS gene invalidation. We obtained UROS function rescue and metabolic correction with both guides with the potential of use for porphyria clinical intervention. However, unlike the biallelic one, the mutant allele-specific guide was free of on-target collateral damage. We recommend this design to avoid genotoxicity and to obtain on-target scarless gene correction for recessive disease with frequent cases of compound heterozygous mutations.

Abstract: Himalayan mountains are distinctly characterized for their unique climatic and topographic variations; therefore, unraveling the cold-adaptive mechanisms and processes of native life forms is always being a matter of concern for scientific community. In this perspective, the proteomic response of psychrophilic diazotroph Pseudomonas helmanticensis was studied towards low-temperature conditions. LC-MS-based analysis revealed that most of the differentially expressed proteins providing cold stress resistance were molecular chaperons and cold shock proteins. Enzymes involved in proline, polyamines, unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, ROS-neutralizing pathways, and arginine degradation were upregulated. However, proteins involved in the oxidative pathways of energy generation were severalfold downregulated. Besides these, the upregulation of uncharacterized proteins at low temperature suggests the expression of novel proteins by P. helmanticensis for cold adaptation. Protein interaction network of P. helmanticensis under cold revealed that Tif, Tig, DnaK, and Adk were crucial proteins involved in cold adaptation. Conclusively, this study documents the proteome and protein-protein interaction network of the Himalayan psychrophilic P. helmanticensis under cold stress.

Abstract: It has been reported that cholesterol-lowing agents can ameliorate severity of myocarditis. However, the beneficial effect of the agents has been claimed to be independent of cholesterol reduction as there is no significant change in the plasma cholesterol level in myocarditis. In the present study, using experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) rats as an animal model, we demonstrated that EAM induced elevation of cholesterol level and impaired cholesterol efflux capacity in the cardiac tissue. Moreover, serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) content was reduced and HDL function associated protein Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity was decreased. Besides, the major structural protein within HDL, Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) expression in the cardiac tissues was significantly reduced while the level of serum ApoA1 was not significantly altered. Importantly, cholesterol depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) alleviated the development of EAM, as monitored by decreased ratio of heart weight to body weight (HW/BW), decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells and collagen deposition, improved cardiac function, reduced expression of apoptosis-related protein Bax, Fas, FasL and caspase-3 and increased level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. These results suggest that reduction of cholesterol level in cardiac tissue could suppress EAM-induced cardiac apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria and their toxins are associated with significant human morbidity and mortality. While a few bacterial toxins are well characterized, the mechanism of action for most toxins has not been elucidated, thereby limiting therapeutic advances. One such example is the highly potent pore-forming toxin, hemolysin BL (HBL), produced by the gram-positive pathogen Bacillus cereus. However, how HBL exerts its effects and whether it requires any host factors is unknown. Here, we describe an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen that identified LPS-induced TNF-α factor (LITAF) as the HBL receptor. Using LITAF-deficient cells, a second, subsequent whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screen identified the LITAF-like protein CDIP1 as a second, alternative receptor. We generated LITAF-deficient mice, which exhibit marked resistance to lethal HBL challenges. This work outlines and validates an approach to use iterative genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify the complement of host factors exploited by bacterial toxins to exert their myriad biological effects.

Abstract: Summary
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to modify up to seven different amino acids with a single mono(ADP-ribose) unit (MARylation deposited by PARP monoenzymes) or branched poly(ADP-ribose) polymers (PARylation deposited by PARP polyenzymes). To enable the development of tool compounds for PARP monoenzymes and polyenzymes, we have developed active site probes for use in in vitro and cellular biophysical assays to characterize active site-directed inhibitors that compete for NAD+ binding. These assays are agnostic of the protein substrate for each PARP, overcoming a general lack of knowledge around the substrates for these enzymes. The in vitro assays use less enzyme than previously described activity assays, enabling discrimination of inhibitor potencies in the single-digit nanomolar range, and the cell-based assays can differentiate compounds with sub-nanomolar potencies and measure inhibitor residence time in live cells.

Abstract: Background
Apoptin can specifically kill cancer cells but has no toxicity to normal cells. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) acts as a tumor-specific promoter, triggering certain genes to replicate or express only in tumor cells, conferring specific replication and killing abilities. This study aimed at investigating the anticancer potential of the recombinant adenovirus Ad-apoptin-hTERTp-E1a (Ad-VT) in ovarian cancer treatment.
Methods
Crystal Violet staining and WST-1 assays were used to analyze the inhibitory effect of Ad-VT on ovarian cancer SKOV3 and OVCAR-3 cells. Ad-VT-induced apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells, was detected using Hoechst, Annexin V-FITC/PI, JC-1 staining. Cell migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells were detected using cell-scratch and Transwell assays. The pGL4.51 plasmid was used to transfect and to generate SKOV3-LUC cells, that stably express luciferase. The in vivo tumor inhibition effect of Ad-VT was subsequently confirmed using a tumor-bearing nude mouse model.
Results
Ad-VT had a strong apoptosis-inducing effect on SKOV3 and OVCAR-3 cells, that was mainly mediated through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The Ad-VT could significantly increase the inhibition of ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion. The Ad-VT also can inhibit tumor growth and reduce toxicity in vivo.
Conclusions
The recombinant adenovirus, comprising the apoptin protein and the hTERTp promoter, was able to inhibit the growth of ovarian cancer cells and promote their apoptosis.

Abstract: The aggregation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy impairment. Mitophagy is a homeostatic mechanism by which autophagy selectively eliminates damaged mitochondria. Valinomycin is a respiratory chain inhibitor that activates mitophagy via the PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway. However, the mechanism underlying the association between mitophagy and valinomycin in Aβ formation has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that genetically modified (N2a/APP695swe) cells overexpressing a mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) serve as an in vitro model of AD for studying mitophagy and ATP-related metabolomics. Our results prove that valinomycin induced a time-dependent increase in the mitophagy activation of N2a/APP695swe cells as indicated by increased levels of PINK1, Parkin, and LC3II as well as increased the colocalization of Parkin–Tom20 and fewer mitochondria (indicated by decreased Tom20 levels). Valinomycin significantly decreased Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 levels after 3 h of treatment. ATP levels and ATP-related metabolites were significantly increased at this time. Our findings suggest that the elimination of impaired mitochondria via valinomycin-induced mitophagy ameliorates AD by decreasing Aβ and improving ATP levels.

Abstract: The pivotal pathogenetic role of microRNAs (miRs) in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) has been demonstrated in mounting evidence. The functions of the target cells are regulated through the release of cells-encapsulated extracellular vesicles (Evs) into the extracellular space. The present study aims to elucidate the clinical significance as well as biological function of the endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-derived Evs containing miR-93-5p in sepsis-induced AKI. We first established a cellular sepsis-induced AKI mouse model by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and tested ectopic expression and depletion experiments in the model. Evs derived from miR-93-5p inhibitor-transfected EPCs (Evs/miR-93-5p inhibitor) were isolated, and co-cultured with HK2 cells to explore the effects of EPC-derived Evs overexpressing miR-93-5p on LPS-induced HK2 cell injury. The interaction between miR-93-5p and lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B) was identified using dual-luciferase reporter assay, and ChIP was used to validate the relationship between KDM6B and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Mice were made septic by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and then injected with Ev/miR-93-5p inhibitor to explore its functions in vivo. The results found that miR-93-5p and histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) were downregulated while KDM6B was upregulated in LPS-treated HK2 cells. EPC-derived Evs alleviated LPS-induced HK2 cell injury, while Ev/miR-93-5p inhibitor potentiated the cell injury in vitro. miR-93-5p was found to directly target KDM6B. Silencing KDM6B induced H3K27me3, inhibiting the activation of TNF-α, thereby weakening LPS-induced HK2 cell injury. EPC-derived Evs containing miR-93-5p attenuated multiple organ injury, vascular leakage, inflammation, and apoptosis in septic mice. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that endothelial protection from EPC-derived Evs carrying miR-93-5p in sepsis-induced AKI, which was mediated by regulation KDM6BH/3K27me3/TNF-α axis.

Abstract: Summary
Ionizing radiation exposure results in acute and delayed bone marrow suppression. Treatment of mice with 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) prior to lethal ionizing radiation (IR) facilitates survival, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms are unclear. In this study we show that dmPGE2 attenuates loss and enhances recovery of bone marrow cellularity, corresponding to a less severe hematopoietic stem cell nadir, and significantly preserves long-term repopulation capacity and progenitor cell function. Mechanistically, dmPGE2 suppressed hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation through 24 h post IR, which correlated with fewer DNA double-strand breaks and attenuation of apoptosis, mitochondrial compromise, oxidative stress, and senescence. RNA sequencing of HSCs at 1 h and 24 h post IR identified a predominant interference with IR-induced p53-downstream gene expression at 1 h, and confirmed the suppression of IR-induced cell-cycle genes at 24 h. These data identify mechanisms of dmPGE2 radioprotection and its potential role as a medical countermeasure against radiation exposure.

Abstract: Background
Regenerating protein 3a (Reg3a) is a trophic factor that functions as a stimulus in cell proliferation and neogenesis. Previous studies showed that Reg3a is ectopically upregulated in a majority of colorectal cancers (CRC) and detectable in the serum.
Methods
Single-chain variable fragment targeting Reg3a (scFv-Reg3a) was screened from a phage library. The bioactivity of recombinant Reg3a (rReg3a) and scFv-Reg3a were tested in LoVo and RKO cell lines using MTT, flow cytometry, wound healing and transwell analyses. Whether scFv-Reg3a inhibits tumor growth and enhances 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-caused cell death were further examined in LoVo cell-transplanted nude BALB/c mice.
Results
A scFv-Reg3a from clone C2 was obtained and its binding affinity (KD) to rReg3a was determined to be 4.44 × 10-10. In cultured LoVo and RKO cells, rReg3a promoted but scFv-Reg3a inhibited cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. In LoVo cell-xenografted nude mice, administration of rReg3a accelerated tumor growth while scFv-Reg3a suppressed cell proliferation and reinforced 5-FU-induced cell death.
Conclusion
The newly developed scFv-Reg3a is an anti-cancer agent which is potent to suppress CRC cell proliferation and survival. The use of scFv-Reg3a could enhance the effectiveness of 5-FU-based chemotherapy in the cancerous treatment.

Abstract: Functional multipotency renders human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (hUC-MSC) a promising candidate for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). However, its safety and efficacy have not been fully understood for clinical translation. In this study, we performed cellular, kinematic, physiological, and anatomical analyses, either in vitro or in vivo, to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy associated with subarachnoid transplantation of hUC-MSCs in rats with subacute incomplete SCI. Concerning safety, hUC-MSCs were shown to have normal morphology, excellent viability, steady proliferation, typical biomarkers, stable karyotype in vitro, and no tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo. Following subarachnoid transplantation of hUC-MSCs in the subject rodents, the biodistribution of hUC-MSCs was restricted to the spinal cord, and no toxicity to immune system or organ function was observed. Body weight, organ weight, and the ratio of the latter upon the former between stem cell-transplanted rats and placebo-injected rats revealed no statistical differences. Regarding efficacy, hUC-MSCs could differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes and neural progenitor cells in vitro. While in vivo studies revealed that subarachnoid transplantation of stem cells resulted in significant improvement in locomotion, earlier automatic micturition recovery and reduced lesion size, which correlated with increased regeneration of tracking fiber and reduced parenchymal inflammation. In vivo luminescence imaging showed that a few of the transplanted luciferase-labeled hUC-MSCs tended to migrate towards the lesion epicenter. Shortened latency and enhanced amplitude were also observed in both motor and sensory evoked potentials, indicating improved signal conduction in the damaged site. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that a few of the administrated hUC-MSCs integrated into the spinal cord parenchyma and differentiated into astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but not neurons. Moreover, decreased astrogliosis, increased remyelination, and neuron regeneration could be observed. To the best of our knowledge, this preclinical study provides detailed safety and efficacy evidence regarding intrathecal transplantation of hUC-MSCs in treating SCI for the first time and thus, supports its initiation in the following clinical trial.

Abstract: Summary
Research shows a higher incidence of colorectal cancer in men. However, the molecular mechanisms for this gender disparity remain unknown. We report the roles of androgen in proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells via targeting of the androgen receptor (AR) on intestinal stromal cells by negatively regulating BMP signaling. Orchidectomy (ORX) or the AR antagonist promotes expansion of intestinal epithelium but suppresses intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation. Conversely, the AR agonist inhibits ISC differentiation but augments proliferation in ovariectomized mice. Mechanistically, activation of the AR increases expression of BMP antagonists but lowers expression of BMP4 and Wnt antagonists in primary stromal cells, which promotes intestinal organoid growth. Interestingly, the BMP pathway inhibitor LDN-193189 reverses the ORX-induced effects. Our results highlight that stromal cells constitute the intestinal stem cell niche and provide a possible explanation for higher incidence rates of colorectal cancer in men.

Abstract: Summary
To date, it remains unclear if there are specific cell-surface markers for purifying glucose-responsive pancreatic β-like cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). In searching for this, we generated an efficient protocol for differentiating β-like cells from human embryonic stem cells. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and found that CD9 is a negative cell-surface marker of β-like cells, as most INS+ cells are CD9−. We purified β-like cells for spontaneous formation of islet-like organoids against CD9, and found significantly more NKX6.1+MAFA+C-PEPTIDE+ β-like cells in the CD9− than in the CD9+ population. CD9− cells also demonstrate better glucose responsiveness than CD9+ cells. In humans, we observe more CD9+C-PEPTIDE+ β cells in the fetal than in the adult cadaveric islets and more Ki67+ proliferating cells among CD9+ fetal β cells. Taken together, our experiments show that CD9 is a cell-surface marker for negative enrichment of glucose-responsive β-like cells differentiated from hPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Experimental fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) analogs can improve lipid profiles in patients with metabolic diseases. However, their effects on markers of insulin sensitivity appear to be minimal, potentially because of insufficient exposure. Systemic drug levels vary from sub-pharmacological to demonstrating pharmacodynamic effects but with dose-limiting adverse events. Here we report results from a phase 1 multiple ascending dose study of AKR-001, an Fc-FGF21 fusion protein engineered for sustained systemic pharmacologic exposure, in individuals with type 2 diabetes. With a half-life of 3–3.5 days, the peak-to-trough ratio under steady-state conditions is approximately 2 following QW dosing. AKR-001 appears to demonstrate pharmacodynamic effects on serum markers of insulin sensitivity and acceptable tolerability up to and including 70 mg QW. Positive trends in lipoprotein profile, including triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol, HDL-C, and apolipoproteins B and C3 are consistent with other FGF21 analogs. AKR-001’s clinical profile supports further evaluation as a treatment for metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus uses its highly glycosylated trimeric Spike protein to bind to the cell surface receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) glycoprotein and facilitate host cell entry. We utilized glycomics-informed glycoproteomics to characterize site-specific microheterogeneity of glycosylation for a recombinant trimer Spike mimetic immunogen and for a soluble version of human ACE2. We combined this information with bioinformatics analyses of natural variants and with existing 3D structures of both glycoproteins to generate molecular dynamics simulations of each glycoprotein both alone and interacting with one another. Our results highlight roles for glycans in sterically masking polypeptide epitopes and directly modulating Spike-ACE2 interactions. Furthermore, our results illustrate the impact of viral evolution and divergence on Spike glycosylation, as well as the influence of natural variants on ACE2 receptor glycosylation. Taken together, these data can facilitate immunogen design to achieve antibody neutralization and inform therapeutic strategies to inhibit viral infection.

Abstract: Sprifermin is a human recombinant fibroblast growth factor 18 (rhFGF18) in clinical development for knee osteoarthritis. Previously, we demonstrated that sprifermin exerts an anabolic effect on chondrocytes in 3D culture with cyclic but not permanent exposure. Here, we hypothesized that permanent exposure to sprifermin de-sensitizes the cells. To test this, a combination of Western-blot and cell staining methods was used. We demonstrate that sprifermin is transiently internalized in chondrocytes along with a transient increase in ERK1/2 activation. We also show that sprifermin is intracellularly degraded, probably together with its receptor FGFR3, thus preventing further stimulation. However, incubation without sprifermin re-sensitizes the cells. Finally, we show that sprifermin endocytosis is clathrin- and dynamin-independent and that receptor activation is not necessary for sprifermin's endocytosis. In this study, we link the role of endocytosis to the cell response and elucidate for the first time a de-sensitization phenomenon to a FGF.

Abstract: This article explores the importance of renewable hydrogen in achieving a ‘climate neutral’ energy system, which will require a large amount of renewable electricity and a very large amount of renewable hydrogen. Because of the fundamental need for energy storage to match supply and demand, a two-carrier approach needs to be adopted, where both electricity and hydrogen are derived from renewable energy. National hydrogen strategies, electrolyser deployment plans and the actions required by governments to overcome the current policy vacuum are discussed. It is recommended that a cross-sector ‘green electrons and green molecules’ strategy is taken, and that policies are developed urgently for advancing the adoption of renewable hydrogen.

Abstract: The adoptive transfer of donor-derived virus-specific T cells (VSTs) is an effective treatment for infections following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Acute exercise mobilizes effector lymphocytes and VSTs to the circulation and augments the ex vivo manufacture of VSTs. This study determined if β2 adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling precipitated the VST response to acute exercise. Healthy participants (n = 12) completed 30 min of steady-state cycling exercise after ingesting a placebo, a β1 + 2 AR antagonist (nadolol) or a β1 AR antagonist (bisoprolol). Circulating VSTs to cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and adenovirus (AdV) antigens were enumerated before and after exercise, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with viral peptides for 8 days to expand multi-VSTs. Compared with placebo, nadolol blunted the exercise-induced mobilization of CMV-VSTs (Δ VSTs/100,000 CD3+ T cells = 93 ± 104 vs. 22 ± 91 for placebo and nadolol, respectively; p = 0.036), while bisoprolol did not, despite both drugs evoking similar reductions in exercising heart rate and blood pressure. Circulating AdV and EBV VSTs (VSTs/mL blood) only increased after exercise with placebo. Although not significant, nadolol partially mitigated exercise-induced increases in multi-VST expansion, particularly in participants that demonstrated an exercise-induced increase in VST expansion. We conclude that exercise-induced enhancements in VST mobilization and expansion are at least partially β2 AR mediated, thus highlighting a role for the β2 AR in targeted therapy for the augmentation of VST immune cell therapeutics in the allogeneic adoptive transfer setting. Moreover, long-term regular exercise may provide additional viral protection in the host through frequent β2 AR-dependent mobilization and redistribution of VSTs cumulated with each bout of exercise.

Abstract: Summary
The last 5 years have witnessed a significant increase in the number of clinical studies based on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). In parallel, concern is increasing about the proliferation of unregulated stem cell treatments worldwide. Regulated clinical testing is a de facto standard to establish the safety and efficacy of new cell therapies, yet reliable information on clinical studies involving hPSCs is scattered. Our analysis of a multitude of resources found 54 clinical studies involving several types of hPSCs, which are performed in ten countries. While the majority of those studies is based on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), clinical studies involving human induced pluripotent stem cells increased more strongly in the past 2 years than the number of hESC-based studies. A publicly accessible database was created using the human pluripotent stem cell registry (https://hpscreg.eu) platform, providing a steadily updated comprehensive overview on hPSC-based clinical studies performed worldwide.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are ubiquitous molecular chaperones found in all domains of life, possessing significant roles in protein quality control in cells and assisting the refolding of non-native proteins. They are efficient chaperones against many in vitro protein substrates. Nevertheless, the in vivo native substrates of sHsps are not known. To better understand the functions of sHsps and the mechanisms by which they enhance heat resistance, sHsp-interacting proteins were identified using affinity purification under heat shock conditions. This paper aims at providing some insights into the characteristics of natural substrate proteins of sHsps. It seems that sHsps of prokaryotes, as well as sHsps of some eukaryotes, can bind to a wide range of substrate proteins with a preference for certain functional classes of proteins. Using Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial Hsp22 as a model system, we observed that this sHsp interacted with the members of ATP synthase machinery. Mechanistically, Hsp22 interacts with the multi-type substrate proteins under heat shock conditions as well as non-heat shock conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Convalescing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients mount robust T cell responses against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting an important role of T cells in viral clearance. To date, the phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells remain poorly defined. Using 38-parameter CyTOF, we phenotyped longitudinal specimens of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from nine individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were exclusively Th1 cells and predominantly Tcm cells with phenotypic features of robust helper function. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells were predominantly Temra cells in a state of less terminal differentiation than most Temra cells. Subsets of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells express CD127, can proliferate homeostatically, and can persist for over 2 months. Our results suggest that long-lived and robust T cell immunity is generated following natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and support an important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in host control of COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiome profoundly affects human health and disease, and their infecting viruses are likely as important, but often missed because of reference database limitations. Here, we (1) built a human Gut Virome Database (GVD) from 2,697 viral particle or microbial metagenomes from 1,986 individuals representing 16 countries, (2) assess its effectiveness, and (3) report a meta-analysis that reveals age-dependent patterns across healthy Westerners. The GVD contains 33,242 unique viral populations (approximately species-level taxa) and improves average viral detection rates over viral RefSeq and IMG/VR nearly 182-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively. GVD meta-analyses show highly personalized viromes, reveal that inter-study variability from technical artifacts is larger than any “disease” effect at the population level, and document how viral diversity changes from human infancy into senescence. Together, this compact foundational resource, these standardization guidelines, and these meta-analysis findings provide a systematic toolkit to help maximize our understanding of viral roles in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
MKK7 (MEK7) is a key regulator of the JNK stress signaling pathway and targeting MKK7 has been proposed as a chemotherapeutic strategy. Detailed understanding of the MKK7 structure and factors that affect its activity is therefore of critical importance. Here, we present a comprehensive set of MKK7 crystal structures revealing insights into catalytic domain plasticity and the role of the N-terminal regulatory helix, conserved in all MAP2Ks, mediating kinase activation. Crystal structures harboring this regulatory helix revealed typical structural features of active kinase, providing exclusively a first model of the MAP2K active state. A small-molecule screening campaign yielded multiple scaffolds, including type II irreversible inhibitors a binding mode that has not been reported previously. We also observed an unprecedented allosteric pocket located in the N-terminal lobe for the approved drug ibrutinib. Collectively, our structural and functional data expand and provide alternative targeting strategies for this important MAP2K kinase.

Abstract: Summary
The group of bacterial non-ribosomally produced peptides (NRPs) forms a rich source of antibiotics, such as daptomycin, vancomycin, and teixobactin. The difficulty of functionally expressing and engineering the corresponding large biosynthetic complexes is a bottleneck in developing variants of such peptides. Here, we apply a strategy to synthesize mimics of the recently discovered antimicrobial NRP brevicidine. We mimicked the molecular structure of brevicidine by ribosomally synthesized, post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) synthesis, introducing several relevant modifications, such as dehydration and thioether ring formation. Following this strategy, in two rounds peptides were engineered in vivo, which showed antibacterial activity against Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria susceptible to wild-type brevicidine. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a strategy to structurally and functionally mimic NRPs by employing the synthesis and post-translational modifications typical for RiPPs. This enables the future generation of large genetically encoded peptide libraries of NRP-mimicking structures to screen for antimicrobial activity against relevant pathogens.

Abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has high aggressiveness and poor prognosis, and is the major histological subtype of esophageal cancer in East Asia and East Africa. In this study, we found that USP46, a deubiquitinating enzyme, is overexpressed in clinical ESCC samples, especially in patients with positive lymph node metastasis. Moreover, USP46 enhances the migration and invasion of ESCC cells by mediating the EMT process in vitro, and promotes lymph nodes and lung metastasis of ESCC in vivo. In addition, we found that USP46 is a bona fide deubiquitinating enzyme to stabilize the protein level of ENO1 through deubiquitination. ENO1 protein level was also positively correlated with USP46 in the ESCC samples. In summary, these findings reveal the functional role of USP46 as a deubiquitinating enzyme on ESCC metastasis, providing us a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ESCC.

Abstract: The Spanish National Stem Cell Bank (Banco Nacional de Líneas Celulares, BNLC) was established in 2006 thanks to a change in the legislative framework in Spain. The Law 14/2006 updated the previous Assisted Reproduction Techniques Law (Law 45/2003) allowing the use of the surplus frozen embryos following IVF for research. The BNLC has a network structure with 3 nodes: the Regenerative Medicine Program (IDIBELL), the Principe Felipe Research Center (CIPF) in Valencia and the Andalusian Public Health System Biobank (SSPA Biobank) in Granada. The aim of the BNLC is to guarantee throughout the national territory the availability of human stem cell lines for biomedical research. At present time, there are 40 human embryonic stem cell lines (hESC) and 171 human induced pluripotent stem cell lines (hiPSC) registered in the BNLC. These lines are fully characterized and available in the context of research projects approved by the Technical Committee of the BNLC.

Abstract: Direct neuronal conversion describes the process of generating induced neurons from somatic cells such as fibroblasts by overexpressing cell type-specific transcription factors, microRNAs or by culturing in the presence of small molecules. This was first achieved by expressing Brn2, Ascl1 and Myt1L in mouse fibroblasts, and was later achieved in human cells by the inclusion of additional factors such as NeuroD1. Here, we present the first protocol for directly converting porcine fibroblasts into induced neurons. We used lentivirus-mediated delivery of previously identified neuron-specifying transcription factors and microRNAs and evaluated morphology and neuron marker expression after ten days of conversion. We found that Ascl1 and microRNAs, miR-9/9* and miR-124 together generated more neuronal cells than other conditions tested. The porcine induced neurons expressed common mature markers such as MAP2 and Synaptophysin after four weeks of conversion. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that fibroblast-specific signatures were silenced early in the conversion process, while the neuron-specific genes became more abundant during conversion. We generated a heterogeneous population of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons.

Abstract: The value of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) in regenerative medicine has yet to reach its full potential. The road from basic research tool to clinically validated PSC-derived cell therapy products is a long and winding one, leading researchers, clinicians, industry and regulators alike into undiscovered territory. All stakeholders must work together to ensure the development of safe and effective cell therapies. Similarly, utilization of hPSC in meaningful and controlled disease modeling and drug screening applications requires information on the quality and suitability of the applied cell lines. Central to these common goals is the complete documentation of hPSC data, including the ethical provenance of the source material, the hPSC line derivation, culture conditions and genetic constitution of the lines. Data surrounding hPSC is scattered amongst diverse sources, including publications, supplemental data, researcher lab books, accredited lab reports, certificates of analyses and public data repositories. Not all of these data sources are publicly accessible nor associated with metadata nor stored in a standard manner, such that data can be easily found and retrieved. The Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Registry (hPSCreg; https://hpscreg.eu/) was started in 2007 to impart provenance and transparency towards hPSC research by registering and collecting standard properties of hPSC lines. In this chapter, we present a short primer on the history of stem cell-based products, summarize the ethical and regulatory issues introduced in the course of working with hPSC-derived products and their associated data, and finally present the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Registry as a valuable resource for all stakeholders in therapies and disease modeling based on hPSC-derived cells.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction is a risk factor in the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease (CD); however, no corrective FDA-approved therapies exist. We used an enteroid (EnO)-based system in two murine models of experimental CD, SAMP1/YitFc (SAMP) and TNFΔARE/+ (TNF). While severely inflamed SAMP mice do not generate EnOs, “inflammation-free” SAMP mice form EnO structures with impaired morphology and reduced intestinal stem cell (ISC) and Paneth cell viability. We validated these findings in TNF mice concluding that inflammation in intestinal tissues impedes EnO generation and suppressing inflammation by steroid administration partially rescues impaired formation in SAMP mice. We generated the first high-resolution transcriptional profile of the SAMP ISC niche demonstrating that alterations in multiple key pathways contribute to niche defect and targeting them may partially rescue the phenotype. Furthermore, we correlated the defects in formation and the rescue of EnO formation to reduced viability of ISCs and Paneth cells.

Abstract: Environmental toxicants such as phthalate have been involved in multiple health disorders including renal diseases. Oxidative damage is implicated in many alterations caused by phthalate especially the di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), which is the most useful phthalate. However, information regarding its mechanism of renal damage is lacking. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates gene expression implicated in free radical scavenging and cytoprotection including the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) pathway. The aim of this study was to assess whether DEHP affects the Nrf2 pathway and the GSH concentration. Mice were divided into four groups: a control group and three groups treated with DEHP at different concentrations (5, 50, and 200 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days. Our results showed that DEHP altered the normal levels of serum biochemical parameters creatinine (CREA), urea, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This phthalate caused oxidative damage through the induction of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation as marked by increase of protein carbonyl (PC) and loss of protein-bound sulfhydryls (PSH). Simultaneously, DEHP treatment decreased the protein level of Nrf-2, HO-1, and GCLC (responsible of GSH synthesis) and decreased the GSH level. Inhibition of the Nrf2 pathway is related to the activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. This apoptotic process is evidenced by an upregulation of p53 and Bax protein levels in addition to a downregulation of Bcl-2. Collectively, our data demonstrated that depletion of Nrf2 and GSH was associated with the elevation of oxidative stress and the activation of intrinsic apoptosis in mouse kidney treated with DEHP.

Abstract: It is challenging to rapidly identify immune responses that reflect the state and capability of immune cells due to complex heterogeneity of immune cells and their plasticity to pathogens and modulating molecules. Thus, high-throughput and easy-to-use cell culture and analysis platforms are highly desired for characterizing complex immune responses and elucidating their underlying mechanisms as well. In response to this need, we have developed a micropillar chip and a 384-pillar plate, printed mouse macrophage, RAW 264.7 cell line in alginate on the pillar plate platforms, and established multiplex cell-based assays to rapidly measure cell viability, expression of cell surface markers, and secretion of cytokines upon stimulation with model compound, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as synthetic N-glycan polymers that mimic native glycoconjugates and could bind to lectin receptors on RAW 264.7 cells. Interestingly, changes in RAW 264.7 cell viability, expression levels of cell surface makers, and release of cytokines measured from the pillar plate platforms in the presence and absence of LPS were well correlated with those obtained from their counterpart, the 96-well plate with 2D-cultured macrophages. With this approach, we identified that α2,3-linked N-sialyllactose polymer has significant macrophage modulation activity among the N-glycan polymers tested. Therefore, we successfully demonstrated that our pillar plate platforms with 3D-cultured macrophages can streamline immune cell imaging and analysis in high throughput in response to compound stimulation. We envision that the pillar plate platforms could potentially be used for rapid characterization of immune cell responses and for screening immune cell-modulating molecules.

Abstract: Summary
Autophagy is a central part of immunity and hence is a key target of pathogens. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which plant pathogens manipulate autophagy remain elusive. We identify a network of 88 interactions between 184 effectors from bacterial, fungal, oomycete, and nematode pathogens with 25 Arabidopsis autophagy (ATG) proteins. Notably, Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pto) bacterial effectors HrpZ1, HopF3, and AvrPtoB employ distinct molecular strategies to modulate autophagy. Calcium-dependent HrpZ1 oligomerization targets ATG4b-mediated cleavage of ATG8 to enhance autophagy, while HopF3 also targets ATG8 but suppresses autophagy, with both effectors promoting infection. AvrPtoB affects ATG1 kinase phosphorylation and enhances bacterial virulence. Since pathogens inject limited numbers of effectors into hosts, our findings establish autophagy as a key target during infection. Additionally, as autophagy is enhanced and inhibited by these effectors, autophagy likely has different functions throughout infection and, thus, must be temporally and precisely regulated for successful infection.

Abstract: Purpose
Skp2, an oncoprotein, regulates tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Ku70 is a critical component of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) process. Both Skp2 and Ku70 are positively associated in multiple cancers. However, there is no report about the relationship between Skp2 and Ku70 proteins.
Methods
In this study, we carried out Bioinformatics and molecular biological methods to investigate the relationship between Skp2 and Ku70 proteins.
Results
We first observed Skp2 and Ku70 mRNAs were significantly increased in cervical cancer tissues. And we identified Ku70 as a Skp2-binding protein and the binding site located in the C–terminal of Ku70 protein. We further found that Skp2 knockdown decreased the Ku70 protein level in cells, and increase the cellular apoptosis and DNA damage, suggesting Skp2 mediates the Ku70 protein stability and function via post-translational modification.
Conclusion
The direct interaction between Skp2 and Ku70 proteins mediates the DNA damage repair and cellular apoptosis by regulating Ku70 stability and function via post-translational modification. The molecular mechanisms how Skp2 stabilize Ku70 would be clarified in our following research work.

Abstract: Summary
The reconstruction of lost neural circuits by cell replacement is a possible treatment for neurological deficits after cerebral cortex injury. Cerebral organoids can be a novel source for cell transplantation, but because the cellular composition of the organoids changes along the time course of the development, it remains unclear which developmental stage of the organoids is most suitable for reconstructing the corticospinal tract. Here, we transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived cerebral organoids at 6 or 10 weeks after differentiation (6w- or 10w-organoids) into mouse cerebral cortices. 6w-organoids extended more axons along the corticospinal tract but caused graft overgrowth with a higher percentage of proliferative cells. Axonal extensions from 10w-organoids were smaller in number but were enhanced when the organoids were grafted 1 week after brain injury. Finally, 10w-organoids extended axons in cynomolgus monkey brains. These results contribute to the development of a cell-replacement therapy for brain injury and stroke.

Abstract: Summary
The ecological dynamics underlying the coexistence between antagonistic populations of bacteria and their viruses, bacteriophages (phages), in the mammalian gut microbiota remain poorly understood. We challenged a murine synthetic bacterial community with phages to study the factors allowing phages-bacteria coexistence. Coexistence was not dependent on the development of phage-resistant clones nor on the ability of phages to extend their host range. Instead, our data suggest that phage-inaccessible sites in the mucosa serve as a spatial refuge for bacteria. From there, bacteria disseminate in the gut lumen where they are predated by luminal phages fostering the presence of intestinal phage populations. The heterogeneous biogeography of microbes contributes to the long-term coexistence of phages with phage-susceptible bacteria. This observation could explain the persistence of intestinal phages in humans as well as the low efficiency of oral phage therapy against enteric pathogens in animal models and clinical trials.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal regeneration is crucial for functional restoration after injury, and nutritional molecules can play an important role in this process. Here, we found that arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a direct proliferation promoter of intestinal epithelial cells that facilitates small intestinal regeneration in both three-dimensional cultured organoids and mouse models. As shown in the study, during post-irradiation regeneration, AA positively regulates intestinal epithelial cell proliferation by upregulating the expression of Ascl2 and activating WNT signaling, but negatively regulates intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. AA acts as a delicate regulator that efficiently facilitates epithelial tissue repair by activating radiation-resistant Msi1+ cells rather than Lgr5+ cells, which are extensively considered WNT-activated crypt base stem cells. Additionally, short-term AA treatment maintains optimal intestinal epithelial homeostasis under physiological conditions. As a result, AA treatment can be considered a potential therapy for irradiation injury repair and tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
CD137 is a costimulatory receptor expressed on natural killer cells, T cells, and subsets of dendritic cells. An agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CD137 has been used to reduce tumor burden or reverse autoimmunity in animal models and clinical trials. Here, we show that mice treated with an agonistic anti-CD137 mAb have reduced numbers of germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in lymphoid tissues, which impair antibody responses to multiple T-cell-dependent antigens, including infectious virus, viral proteins, and conjugated haptens. These effects are not due to enhanced apoptosis or impaired proliferation of B cells but instead correlate with changes in lymphoid follicle structure and GC B cell dispersal and are mediated by CD137 signaling in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Our experiments in mice suggest that agonistic anti-CD137 mAbs used in cancer and autoimmunity therapy may impair long-term antibody and B cell memory responses.

Abstract: Our present study investigated whether exosome secretion of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) is regulated by autophagy. Different autophagic states of NPCs were induced by rapamycin (Rap), bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and other agents, and it was found that exosomes were secreted in an autophagy-dependent manner. Activation or inhibition of autophagy increased or decreased, respectively, the amount of exosomes that were released into the extracellular space. In addition, in order to confirm that Rap-promoted release of exosomes was mediated by autophagy rather than other pathways, we used autophagy associated gene 5 (ATG5) small-interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence the expression of ATG5 gene, which is indispensable for autophagy. The results showed that siRNA against ATG5 (siATG5) induced an accumulation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in NPCs and a concomitant decrease in the amount of exosomes isolated from supernatant. Ras homolog gene (Rho) and Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK) family molecules are capable of cytoskeletal remodeling and affecting vesicle transport. Therefore, we carried out targeted interventions and evaluated the effects of the RhoC/ROCK2 pathway on the secretion of exosomes within autophagic environment. Knockdown of RhoC and ROCK2 with corresponding siRNA significantly inhibited the secretion of exosomes originating from ILVs in NPCs, even when NPCs were subsequently treated with Rap. Taken together, our findings suggest that autophagy positively regulates expression levels of RhoC and ROCK2, and that the RhoC/ROCK2 pathway exerts a key function on NPCs-derived exosome secretion.

Abstract: Cellular senescence is defined by irreversible cell-cycle arrest and is an evolutionarily conserved hallmark of aging. In this study, we generate senescent microglial cells via exposure to the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin. Compared to control cells, doxorubicin-treated microglia exhibited an altered morphology characterized by an enlarged cell size, a flattened appearance, and the development of prominent filaments. Senescent cells harbored elevated levels of senescence associated-β-galactosidase, p16Ink4a, and γ-H2AX. Senescent microglia were also less efficient at internalizing amyloid β and pHrodo bioparticles. A detailed proteomic analysis using SWATH-MS identified 201 proteins that were significantly downregulated and 127 that were significantly upregulated in doxorubicin-treated microglia. Proteins involved in processes such as protein synthesis, RNA damage and repair, and protein degradation were largely downregulated while those compromising the integrity of the cell were predominantly upregulated. Various proteins involved in proteasomal processing were among the most significantly downregulated in senescent cells. Relevant to the deleterious senescence-associated secretory phenotype, senescent cells secreted higher levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and GRO-α. Our data suggest that symptoms of brain aging and age-related neurodegenerative disease may be partially caused by defective phagocytosis, impaired proteasomal processing, and elevated cytokine secretion of senescent microglia.

Abstract: Wide peritoneal metastasis is the cause of the highest lethality of ovarian cancer in gynecologic malignancies. Ascites play a key role in ovarian cancer metastasis, but involved mechanism is uncertain. Here, we performed a quantitative proteomics of ascites, and found that collagen type I alpha 1 (COL1A1) was notably elevated in ascites from epithelial ovarian cancer patients compared to normal peritoneal fluids, and verified that elevated COL1A1 was mainly originated from fibroblasts. COL1A1 promoted migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, but such effects were partially eliminated by COL1A1 antibodies. Intraperitoneally injected COL1A1 accelerated intraperitoneal metastasis of ovarian cancer xenograft in NOD/SCID mice. Further, COL1A1 activated downstream AKT phosphorylation by binding to membrane surface receptor integrin β1 (ITGB1). Knockdown or blockage of ITGB1 reversed COL1A1 enhanced migration and invasion in ovarian cancer cells. Conversely, ovarian cancer ascites and fibrinogen promoted fibroblasts to secrete COL1A1. Elevated fibrinogen in ascites might be associated with increased vascular permeability induced by ovarian cancer. Our findings suggest that microenvironment remodeled by tumor cells and stromal cells promotes fibroblasts to secrete COL1A1 and facilitates the metastasis of ovarian cancer, which may provide a new approach for ovarian cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
Severe disease of SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by vigorous inflammatory responses in the lung, often with a sudden onset after 5–7 days of stable disease. Efforts to modulate this hyperinflammation and the associated acute respiratory distress syndrome rely on the unraveling of the immune cell interactions and cytokines that drive such responses. Given that every patient is captured at different stages of infection, longitudinal monitoring of the immune response is critical and systems-level analyses are required to capture cellular interactions. Here, we report on a systems-level blood immunomonitoring study of 37 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and followed with up to 14 blood samples from acute to recovery phases of the disease. We describe an IFNγ-eosinophil axis activated before lung hyperinflammation and changes in cell-cell co-regulation during different stages of the disease. We also map an immune trajectory during recovery that is shared among patients with severe COVID-19.

Abstract: The secretory pathway of neurons and endocrine cells contains a variety of mechanisms designed to combat cellular stress. These include not only the unfolded protein response pathways but also diverse chaperone proteins that collectively work to ensure proteostatic control of secreted and membrane-bound molecules. One of the least studied of these chaperones is the neural- and endocrine-specific molecule known as proSAAS. This small chaperone protein acts as a potent anti-aggregant both in vitro and in cellulo and also represents a cerebrospinal fluid biomarker in Alzheimer’s disease. In the present study, we have examined the idea that proSAAS, like other secretory chaperones, might represent a stress-responsive protein. We find that exposure of neural and endocrine cells to the cell stressors tunicamycin and thapsigargin increases cellular proSAAS mRNA and protein in Neuro2A cells. Paradoxically, proSAAS secretion is inhibited by these same drugs. Exposure of Neuro2A cells to low concentrations of the hypoxic stress inducer cobalt chloride, or to sodium arsenite, an oxidative stressor, also increases cellular proSAAS content and reduces its secretion. We conclude that the cellular levels of the small secretory chaperone proSAAS are positively modulated by cell stress.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence shows the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumorigenesis of many types of human cancers. However, the role of LINC00858 in colon cancer has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of LINC00858 in the progression of colon cancer and identified its downstream targets. After examining the expression of LINC00858 in colon cancer tissues and cell lines, we then identified the possible interaction between LINC00858 and WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 2 (WNK2) by fluorescence in situ hybridization, RNA immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and RNA pull-down assays. Next, the role of the LINC00858/WNK2 axis was explored by evaluating the apoptosis, autophagy, and senescence of colon cancer cells in vitro after ectopic expression and depletion experiments in HCT116 cells. Moreover, a mouse xenograft model of HCT116 cells was established to verify the function of the LINC00858/WNK2 axis in vivo. There was high expression of LINC00858 and low expression of WNK2 in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. Silencing of LINC00858 promoted apoptosis, senescence, and autophagy in colon cancer cells. Additionally, the enrichment of WNK2 was promoted when LINC00858 bound to DNA methyltransferases. Furthermore, in vivo assays demonstrated that silencing of LINC00858 resulted in inhibited tumor growth by upregulating WNK2. In summary, LINC00858 acts as a tumor-promoting lncRNA in colon cancer by downregulating WNK2. Our results may provide novel targets for the treatment for colon cancer.

Abstract: The most common subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the clear cell RCC (ccRCC) that accounts for 70–80% of cases. The fate of ccRCC is linked to alterations of genes that regulate TP53. The dysfunction of p53 affects several processes including autophagy, which is increased in different advanced carcinomas and could be associated with cancer progression. We report that different kidney cancer cell lines show higher levels of autophagy than control cells. The increased autophagy is associated with the upregulation of miR501-5p, which stimulates mTOR-independent autophagy by the activation of AMP kinase. AMPK activation occurs through the decrease of ATP generation caused by the downregulation of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) that leads to the reduction of mitochondrial calcium uptake. Autophagy induction promotes the degradation of p53 through the autophagolysosomal machinery. Consistently, the inhibition of autophagy reduces both cell proliferation and migration enhancing the expression of p53, p21 and E-Cadherin as well as decreasing Vimentin synthesis. Taken together, these findings indicate that autophagy is involved in the progression of kidney cancer. Therefore, the pharmacological targeting of this process could be considered an interesting option for the treatment of advanced renal carcinoma.

Abstract: Hyperactivated Notch signalling has been implicated in breast cancer, but how elevated levels of Notch signalling contribute to mammary dysplasia and tumorigenesis is not fully understood. In this study, we express an activated form of Notch1 in the mouse mammary luminal lineage and analyse the consequences for tumour formation and the transcriptomic landscape in the luminal lineage. Simultaneous conditional activation of a Notch1 intracellular domain (Notch1 ICD) and EGFP in the luminal lineage was achieved by removal of a stop cassette by CRE-recombinase expression from the whey acidic protein (WAP) promoter. Mice in which Notch1 ICD was activated in the luminal lineage (WAP-CRE;R26-N1ICD mice) exhibit ductal hyperplasia after lactation with an increase in branching frequency and in the number of side-branch ends in the ductal tree. A subset of the mice developed mammary tumours and the majority of the tumour cells expressed EGFP (as a proxy for Notch1 ICD), indicating that the tumours originate from the Notch1 ICD-expressing cells. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of the EGFP-positive mammary cells identified six subtypes of luminal cells. The same six subtypes were found in control mice (WAP-CRE;R26-tdTomato mice expressing the tdTomato reporter from WAP-CRE-mediated activation), but the proportion of cells in the various subtypes differed between the WAP-CRE;R26-N1ICD and control WAP-CRE;R26-tdTomato mice. In conclusion, we show that Notch1 ICD expression in the luminal lineage produces a ductal hyperplasia and branching phenotype accompanied by altered luminal cell subtype partitioning.

Abstract: Summary
T cell immunity toward SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-), membrane (M-), and nucleocapsid (N-) proteins may define COVID-19 severity. Therefore, we compare the SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell responses in moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 patients and unexposed donors. Overlapping peptide pools of all three proteins induce SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell response with dominance of CD4+ over CD8+ T cells and demonstrate interindividual immunity against the three proteins. M-protein induces the highest frequencies of CD4+ T cells, suggesting its relevance for diagnosis and vaccination. The T cell response of critical COVID-19 patients is robust and comparable or even superior to non-critical patients. Virus clearance and COVID-19 survival are not associated with either SARS-CoV-2 T cell kinetics or magnitude of T cell responses, respectively. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis of insufficient SARS-CoV-2-reactive immunity in critical COVID-19. Conversely, it indicates that activation of differentiated memory effector T cells could cause hyperreactivity and immunopathogenesis in critical patients.

Abstract: Summary
There is an urgent need for rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing in hospitals to limit nosocomial spread. We report an evaluation of point of care (POC) nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) in 149 participants with parallel combined nasal and throat swabbing for POC versus standard lab RT-PCR testing. Median time to result is 2.6 (IQR 2.3–4.8) versus 26.4 h (IQR 21.4–31.4, p < 0.001), with 32 (21.5%) positive and 117 (78.5%) negative. Cohen’s κ correlation between tests is 0.96 (95% CI 0.91–1.00). When comparing nearly 1,000 tests pre- and post-implementation, the median time to definitive bed placement from admission is 23.4 (8.6-41.9) versus 17.1 h (9.0–28.8), p = 0.02. Mean length of stay on COVID-19 “holding” wards is 58.5 versus 29.9 h (p < 0.001). POC testing increases isolation room availability, avoids bed closures, allows discharge to care homes, and expedites access to hospital procedures. POC testing could mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on hospital systems.

Abstract: Summary
Solution-based structural techniques complement high-resolution structural data by providing insight into the oft-missed links between protein structure and dynamics. Here, we present Parallel Chemoselective Profiling, a solution-based structural method for characterizing protein structure and dynamics. Our method utilizes deep mutational scanning saturation mutagenesis data to install amino acid residues with specific chemistries at defined positions on the solvent-exposed surface of a protein. Differences in the extent of labeling of installed mutant residues are quantified using targeted mass spectrometry, reporting on each residue's local environment and structural dynamics. Using our method, we studied how conformation-selective, ATP-competitive inhibitors affect the local and global structure and dynamics of full-length Src kinase. Our results highlight how parallel chemoselective profiling can be used to study a dynamic multi-domain protein, and suggest that our method will be a useful addition to the relatively small toolkit of existing protein footprinting techniques.

Abstract: Inflammation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis (AS), which has been identified as a major predisposing factor for stroke. Macrophages and VSMCs are associated with plaque formation and progression. Macrophages can dynamically change into two main functional phenotypes, namely M1 and M2, they can produce either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory factors which may affect the outcome of inflammation. As a member of CTRPs family, CTRP9 has been reported play important protective roles in the cardiovascular system. However, whether CTRP9 can regulate macrophage activation status in inflammatory responses and have effect on VSMCs behaviors in co-culture system have not been fully investigated. In the present study, using peritoneal macrophages treated with CTRP9, we found that CTRP9 facilitated macrophages towards M1 phenotype, promoted TNF-α secretion and MMPs expression. CTRP9 showed synergistic effect with LPS in inducing M1 macrophages. In macrophages-VSMCs co-culture system, apoptosis and down-regulated proliferation of VSMCs were accelerated with CTRP9-treated macrophages. Then we attempted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of CTRP9 resulting in M1 activation. The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) are members of the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) family, plays a central role in the cell stress response, with outcomes ranging from cell death to cell proliferation and survival. We found JNK expression was upregulated following CTRP9 stimulation, and inhibiting JNK phosphorylation level was associated with decreased expression of M1 markers and TNF-α concentration. Moreover, VSMCs apoptosis were ameliorated after inhibition of JNK. These results suggested that CTRP9 may promote macrophage towards M1 activation status through JNK signaling pathway activation.

Abstract: L1 is an immunoglobulin domain (Ig)-containing protein essential for a wide range of neurodevelopmental processes highly conserved across species from worms to humans. L1 can act as a cell adhesion molecule by binding to other Ig-containing proteins or as a ligand for certain tyrosine kinase receptors such as FGFRs and TRKs, which are required not only during neurodevelopment but also in hippocampal neurogenesis. Yet, the role of L1 itself in adult hippocampal neurogenesis remains unaddressed. Here, we used several Cre-driver lines in mice to conditionally delete a floxed allele of L1cam at different points along the differentiation lineage of new neurons and in surrounding neurons in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We found that L1cam deletion in stem/progenitor cells increased: 1) the differentiation of progenitors into new neurons, 2) the complexity of dendritic arbors in immature neurons, and 3) anxiety-related behavior. In addition, deletion of L1cam in neurons leads to an earlier age-related decline in hippocampal neurogenesis. These data suggest that L1 is not only important for normal nervous system development, but also for maintaining certain neural processes in adulthood.

Abstract: The small GTPase Cdc42, a member of the Rho family, regulates essential biological processes such as cytoskeleton remodeling, migration, vesicular trafficking and cell cycle. It was demonstrated that Cdc42 overactivation through different molecular strategies increases cell sensitivity to genotoxic stress and affects the phosphorylation status of DNA damage response proteins by unknown mechanisms. By using a combination of approaches including affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP/MS) and colocalization microscopy analysis we were able to identify Cdc42EP3/Borg2 as a putative molecular effector of these molecular and cellular events that seem to be independent of cell line or DNA damage stimuli. We then investigated the influence of Cdc42EP3/Borg2 and other potential protein partners, such as the NCK and Septin2 proteins, which could mediate cellular responses to genotoxic stress under different backgrounds of Cdc42 activity. Clonogenic assays showed a reduced cell survival when ectopically expressing the Cdc42EP3/Borg2, NCK2 or Septin2 in an overactivated Cdc42-dependent background. Moreover, endogenous NCK appears to relocate into the nucleus upon Cdc42 overactivation, especially under genotoxic stress, and promotes the suppression of Chk1 phosphorylation. In sum, our findings reinforce Cdc42 as an important player involved in the DNA damage response acting through Cdc42EP3/Borg2 and NCK proteins following genomic instability conditions.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a bone malignancy affecting children and adolescents. Retinoblastoma (RB) patients with germline RB1 mutations are susceptible to osteosarcoma in the second decade of their life. Several studies, particularly in mice, have revealed a role for RB1 in osteogenesis. Since, there is species specific difference attributed in retinoblastoma tumorigenesis between mice and human, we assumed, it is worthwhile exploring the role of RB1 in osteogenesis and thus onset of osteosarcoma. In this study, we analyzed the temporal gene expression of the osteogenic markers, tumor suppressor genes and hormone receptors associated with growth spurt during in vitro osteogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells derived from orbital adipose tissue of germline RB patients and compared it with those with wild type RB1 gene. Mesenchymal stem cells with the heterozygous RB1 mutation showed reduced expression of RB1 and other tumor suppressor genes and showed deregulation of osteogenic markers which could be an initial step for the onset of osteosarcoma.

Abstract: Summary
The primary cilium is the non-motile cilium present in most mammalian cell types and functions as an antenna for cells to sense signals. Ablating primary cilia in postnatal newborn neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) results in both reduced dendritic arborization and synaptic strength, leading to hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common form of inheritance for intellectual disabilities with a high risk for autism spectrum disorders, and Fmr1 KO mice, a mouse model for FXS, demonstrate deficits in newborn neuron differentiation, dendritic morphology, and memory formation in the DG. Here, we found that the number of primary cilia in Fmr1 KO mice is reduced, specifically in the DG of the hippocampus. Moreover, this cilia loss was observed postnatally mainly in newborn neurons generated from the DG, implicating that these primary ciliary deficits may possibly contribute to the pathophysiology of FXS.

Abstract: Summary
The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a key regulator of embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and differentiation. Constitutive activation of this pathway has been shown to increase mouse ESC (mESC) self-renewal and pluripotency gene expression. In this study, we generated a novel β-catenin knockout model in mESCs to delete putatively functional N-terminally truncated isoforms observed in previous knockout models. We showed that aberrant N-terminally truncated isoforms are not functional in mESCs. In the generated knockout line, we observed that canonical Wnt signaling is not active, as β-catenin ablation does not alter mESC transcriptional profile in serum/LIF culture conditions. In addition, we observed that Wnt signaling activation represses mESC spontaneous differentiation in a β-catenin-dependent manner. Finally, β-catenin (ΔC) isoforms can rescue β-catenin knockout self-renewal defects in mESCs cultured in serum-free medium and, albeit transcriptionally silent, cooperate with TCF1 and LEF1 to inhibit mESC spontaneous differentiation in a GSK3-dependent manner.

Abstract: This study was first and systematically conducted to evaluate the hypoxia response of the brain, heart, lung, liver, and kidney of mice exposed to an animal hypobaric chamber. First, we examined the pathological damage of the above tissues by Hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. Secondly, biochemical assays were used to detect oxidative stress indicators such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Finally, the hypoxia compensation mechanism of tissues was evaluated by expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), erythropoietin (EPO), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). During the experiment, the mice lost weight gradually on the first 3 days, and then, the weight loss tended to remain stable, and feed consumption showed the inverse trend. H&E staining results showed that there were sparse and atrophic neurons and dissolved chromatin in the hypoxia group. And hyperemia occurred in the myocardium, lung, liver, and kidney. Meanwhile, hypoxia stimulated the enlargement of myocardial space, the infiltration of inflammatory cells in lung tissue, the swelling of epithelial cells in hepatic lobules and renal tubules, and the separation of basal cells. Moreover, hypoxia markedly inhibited the activity of SOD and GSH and exacerbated the levels of MDA and GSSG in the serum and five organs. In addition, hypoxia induced the expression of HIF-1α, EPO, and VEGF in five organs. These results suggest hypoxia leads to oxidative damage and compensation mechanism of the brain, heart, lung, liver, and kidney in varying degrees of mice.

Abstract: Summary
Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) are commercially available, and cardiac differentiation established routine. Systematic evaluation of several control hiPSC-CM is lacking. We investigated 10 different control hiPSC-CM lines and analyzed function and suitability for drug screening. Five commercial and 5 academic hPSC-CM lines were casted in engineered heart tissue (EHT) format. Spontaneous and stimulated EHT contractions were analyzed, and 7 inotropic indicator compounds investigated on 8 cell lines. Baseline contractile force, kinetics, and rate varied widely among the different lines (e.g., relaxation time range: 118-471 ms). In contrast, the qualitative correctness of responses to BayK-8644, nifedipine, EMD-57033, isoprenaline, and digoxin in terms of force and kinetics varied only between 80% and 93%. Large baseline differences between control cell lines support the request for isogenic controls in disease modeling. Variability appears less relevant for drug screening but needs to be considered, arguing for studies with more than one line.

Abstract: The fundamental reasons for considering the adoption of hydrogen as a fuel, industrial feedstock and energy storage medium are presented. Hydrogen production methods are outlined, with reference to the colour prefixes used to describe different types of hydrogen. The relative greenhouse gas emissions and economics of green and blue hydrogen production are considered for achieving a ‘net zero’ climate-neutral energy system by 2050. In general, it appears that green hydrogen will soon be cheaper than blue hydrogen due to the falling costs of renewable electricity and electrolysers, then cheaper than grey hydrogen, and in the long term potentially cheaper than natural gas.

Abstract: Summary
Tobacco smoke exposure contributes to the global burden of communicable and chronic diseases. To identify the immune cells affected by smoking, we use single-cell RNA sequencing on peripheral blood from smokers and nonsmokers. Transcriptomes reveal a subpopulation of FCGR3A (CD16)-expressing natural killer (NK)-like CD8 T lymphocytes that increase in smokers. Mass cytometry confirms elevated CD16+ CD8 T cells in smokers. Inferred as highly differentiated by pseudotime analysis, NK-like CD8 T cells express markers that are characteristic of effector memory re-expressing CD45RA T (TEMRA) cells. Indicative of immune aging, smokers’ CD8 T cells are biased toward differentiated cells, and smokers have fewer naive cells than nonsmokers. DNA methylation-based models show that smoking dose is associated with accelerated aging and decreased telomere length, a biomarker of T cell senescence. Immune aging accompanies T cell senescence, which can ultimately lead to impaired immune function. This suggests a role for smoking-induced, senescence-associated immune dysregulation in smoking-mediated pathologies.

Abstract: Summary
Neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) typically show regular spiking and synaptic activity but lack more complex network activity critical for brain development, such as periodic depolarizations including simultaneous involvement of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. We generated human iPSC-derived neurons exhibiting spontaneous oscillatory activity after cultivation of up to 6 months, which resembles early oscillations observed in rodent neurons. This behavior was found in neurons generated using a more “native” embryoid body protocol, in contrast to a “fast” protocol based on NGN2 overexpression. A comparison with published data indicates that EB-derived neurons reach the maturity of neurons of the third trimester and NGN2-derived neurons of the second trimester of human gestation. Co-culturing NGN2-derived neurons with astrocytes only led to a partial compensation and did not reliably induce complex network activity. Our data will help selection of the appropriate iPSC differentiation assay to address specific questions related to neurodevelopmental disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Many cellular delivery reagents enter the cytosolic space of cells by escaping the lumen of endocytic organelles and, more specifically, late endosomes. The mechanisms involved in endosomal membrane permeation remain largely unresolved, which impedes the improvement of delivery agents. Here, we investigate how 3TAT, a branched analog of the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) TAT, achieves the permeabilization of bilayers containing bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid found in late endosomes. We establish that the peptide does not induce the leakage of individual lipid bilayers. Instead, leakage requires contact between membranes. Peptide-driven bilayer contacts lead to fusion, lipid mixing, and, critically, peptide encapsulation within proximal bilayers. Notably, this encapsulation is a distinctive property of BMP that explains the specificity of CPP's membrane leakage activity. These results therefore support a model of cell penetration that requires both BMP and the vicinity between bilayers, two features unique to BMP-rich and multivesicular late endosomes.

Abstract: Microglia are resident tissue macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) that arise from erythromyeloid progenitors during embryonic development. They play essential roles in CNS development, homeostasis and response to disease. Since microglia are difficult to procure from the human brain, several protocols have been developed to generate microglia-like cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). However, some concerns remain over the purity and quality of in vitro generated microglia. Here, we describe a new protocol that does not require co-culture with neural cells and yields cultures of 100% P2Y12+ 95% TMEM119+ ramified human microglia-like cells (hiPSC-MG). In the presence of neural precursor cell-conditioned media, hiPSC-MG expressed high levels of human microglia signature genes, including SALL1, CSF1R, P2RY12, TMEM119, TREM2, HEXB and SIGLEC11, as revealed by whole-transcriptome analysis. Stimulation of hiPSC-MG with lipopolysaccharide resulted in downregulation of P2Y12 expression, induction of IL1B mRNA expression and increase in cell capacitance. HiPSC-MG were phagocytically active and maintained their cell identity after transplantation into murine brain slices and human brain spheroids. Together, our new protocol for the generation of microglia-like cells from human iPSCs will facilitate the study of human microglial function in health and disease.

Abstract: Summary
The pluripotency of stem cells determines their developmental potential. While the pluripotency states of pluripotent stem cells are variable and interconvertible, the mechanisms underlying the acquisition and maintenance of pluripotency remain largely elusive. Here, we identified that methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NAD+-dependent), methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (Mthfd2) plays an essential role in maintaining embryonic stem cell pluripotency and promoting complete reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells. Mechanistically, in mitochondria, Mthfd2 maintains the integrity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and prevents mitochondrial dysfunction. In the nucleus, Mthfd2 stabilizes the phosphorylation of EXO1 to support DNA end resection and promote homologous recombination repair. Our results revealed that Mthfd2 is a dual-function factor in determining the pluripotency of pluripotent stem cells through both mitochondrial and nuclear pathways, ultimately ensuring safe application of pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is caused by amyloid deposition of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) in various tissues. Recently, reduction of circulating serum TTR, achieved via silencing oligonucleotides, was introduced as therapy of ATTR amyloidosis. We explored the impact of Serpin Family A Member 1 (SERPINA1) on TTR mRNA and protein expression. Oncostatin M (OSM) induced SERPINA1 in hepatoma cells and mice, while concomitantly TTR expression was significantly reduced. SERPINA1 knockdown resulted in specific elevated TTR expression in hepatoma cells; however other genes belonging to the group of acute phase proteins were unaffected. In mice, serum TTR was elevated after mSERPINA1 knockdown throughout antisense treatment. Following SERPINA1 knockdown, TTR deposition in several tissues, including dorsal root ganglia and intestine, was found to be increased, however numbers did not exceed significance levels. The data suggest that SERPINA1 is a co-factor of TTR expression. Our findings provide novel insight in the regulation of TTR and reveal a role of SERPINA1 in the pathogenesis of ATTR amyloidosis.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins are ubiquitously expressed chaperones, yet mutations in some of them cause tissue-specific diseases. Here, we will discuss how small heat shock proteins give rise to neurodegenerative disorders themselves while we will also highlight how these proteins can fulfil protective functions in neurodegenerative disorders caused by protein aggregation. The first half of this paper will be focused on how mutations in HSPB1, HSPB3, and HSPB8 are linked to inherited peripheral neuropathies like Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN). The second part of the paper will discuss how small heat shock proteins are linked to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease.

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important players in prostate cancer (PCa) development and progression, but their detailed mechanisms have not been elucidated. Herein, hsa_circ_0007494 was suppressed in the PCa cell lines and tissues. This resulted in metastasis of tumors to the lymph node and predicted tumor stage. Functionally, overexpression of hsa_circ_0007494 inhibited the proliferation and invasive capacity of the cells in vitro and blocked the growth of tumors in vivo. Hsa_circ_0007494 functioned as a “molecular sponge” for miR-616 and hence upregulated the target of miR-616, PTEN. In addition, rescue assays revealed that PTEN silencing (or miR-616 mimics) blocked the tumor-suppressing effects of hsa_circ_0007494 overexpression on PCa progression. Together, our findings indicate that hsa_circ_0007494 suppresses PCa by forming a negative regulatory network including hsa_circ_0007494/miR-616/PTEN. Thus, hsa_circ_0007494 may be a treatment target for PCa.

Abstract: Summary
Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in defined medium resemble the pre-implantation epiblast in the ground state, with full developmental capacity including the germline. β-Catenin is required to maintain ground state pluripotency in mouse ESCs, but its exact role is controversial. Here, we reveal a Tcf3-independent role of β-catenin in restraining germline and somatic lineage differentiation genes. We show that β-catenin binds target genes with E2F6 and forms a complex with E2F6 and HMGA2 or E2F6 and HP1γ. Our data indicate that these complexes help β-catenin restrain and fine-tune germ cell and neural developmental potential. Overall, our data reveal a previously unappreciated role of β-catenin in preserving lineage differentiation integrity in ground state ESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Blood-borne factors regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition in mammals. We report that elevating circulating unacylated-ghrelin (UAG), using both pharmacological and genetic methods, reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity in mice. Spatial memory impairments observed in ghrelin-O-acyl transferase-null (GOAT−/−) mice that lack acyl-ghrelin (AG) but have high levels of UAG were rescued by acyl-ghrelin. Acyl-ghrelin-mediated neurogenesis in vitro was dependent on non-cell-autonomous BDNF signaling that was inhibited by UAG. These findings suggest that post-translational acylation of ghrelin is important to neurogenesis and memory in mice. To determine relevance in humans, we analyzed circulating AG:UAG in Parkinson disease (PD) patients diagnosed with dementia (PDD), cognitively intact PD patients, and controls. Notably, plasma AG:UAG was only reduced in PDD. Hippocampal ghrelin-receptor expression remained unchanged; however, GOAT+ cell number was reduced in PDD. We identify UAG as a regulator of hippocampal-dependent plasticity and spatial memory and AG:UAG as a putative circulating diagnostic biomarker of dementia.

Abstract: Summary
Rhomboid intramembrane proteases regulate pathophysiological processes, but their targeting in a disease context has never been achieved. We decoded the atypical substrate specificity of malaria rhomboid PfROM4, but found, unexpectedly, that it results from “steric exclusion”: PfROM4 and canonical rhomboid proteases cannot cleave each other's substrates due to reciprocal juxtamembrane steric clashes. Instead, we engineered an optimal sequence that enhanced proteolysis >10-fold, and solved high-resolution structures to discover that boronates enhance inhibition >100-fold. A peptide boronate modeled on our “super-substrate” carrying one “steric-excluding” residue inhibited PfROM4 but not human rhomboid proteolysis. We further screened a library to discover an orthogonal alpha-ketoamide that potently inhibited PfROM4 but not human rhomboid proteolysis. Despite the membrane-immersed target and rapid invasion, ultrastructural analysis revealed that single-dosing blood-stage malaria cultures blocked host-cell invasion and cleared parasitemia. These observations establish a strategy for designing parasite-selective rhomboid inhibitors and expose a druggable dependence on rhomboid proteolysis in non-motile parasites.

Abstract: Summary
We previously reported a peptoid ligand for the proteasomal ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 called KDT-11 and demonstrated that this compound is toxic to multiple myeloma cells, but not non-malignant cells. Here, we show that KDT-11 decreases the viability of a variety of cancer cell lines, especially melanomas and various blood cancers. The peptoid induces selective G1 cell-cycle arrest, resulting in eventual apoptosis. While KDT-11 does not antagonize any of the known protein-protein interactions involving Rpn13, the peptoid inhibits the ability of Rpn13 to stimulate the activity of an associated deubiquitylase Uch37/UCHL5 in vitro, suggesting a high level of Uch37 activity might be important for cancer cell proliferation. However, a variety of experiments in SK-MEL-5 melanoma cells suggest that KDT-11's cytotoxic effects are mediated by interactions with proteins other than Rpn13.

Abstract: Summary
Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induces long-term boosting of innate immunity, termed trained immunity, and decreases susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. BCG vaccination trials for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection are underway, but concerns have been raised regarding the potential harm of strong innate immune responses. To investigate the safety of BCG vaccination, we retrospectively assessed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related symptoms in three cohorts of healthy volunteers who either received BCG in the last 5 years or did not. BCG vaccination is not associated with increased incidence of symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands. Our data suggest that BCG vaccination might be associated with a decrease in the incidence of sickness during the COVID-19 pandemic (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.58, p < 0.05), and lower incidence of extreme fatigue. In conclusion, recent BCG vaccination is safe, and large randomized trials are needed to reveal if BCG reduces the incidence and/or severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells initiate an innate immune response by synthesizing and exporting the small-molecule immunotransmitter cGAMP, which activates the anti-cancer Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway in the host. An extracellular enzyme, ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), hydrolyzes cGAMP and negatively regulates this anti-cancer immune response. Small-molecule ENPP1 inhibitors are much needed as tools to study the basic biology of extracellular cGAMP and as investigational cancer immunotherapy drugs. Here, we surveyed structure-activity relationships around a series of cell-impermeable and thus extracellular-targeting phosphonate inhibitors of ENPP1. In addition, we solved the crystal structure of an exemplary phosphonate inhibitor to elucidate the interactions that drive potency. This study yielded several best-in-class inhibitors with Ki < 2 nM and excellent physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate that an ENPP1 inhibitor delays tumor growth in a breast cancer mouse model. Together, we have developed ENPP1 inhibitors that are excellent tool compounds and potential therapeutics.

Abstract: Pharmacologic induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is an effective strategy for treating β-hemoglobinopathies like β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia by ameliorating disease severity. Hydroxyurea is the only FDA-approved agent that induces HbF, but significant nonresponders and toxicity limit its clinical usefulness. This study relates preclinical investigation of Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) as a potential HbF inducing agent, using human erythroleukemia cell line and a β-YAC mouse model. Erythroid induction of K562 cells was studied by the benzidine/H2O2 reaction, total hemoglobin production was estimated by plasma hemoglobin assay kit, and γ-globin gene expression by RT-qPCR, whereas, fetal hemoglobin production was estimated by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. We observed significantly increased γ- globin gene transcription and HbF expression mediated by TDF in K562 cells. Subsequent treatment of β-YAC transgenic mice with TDF confirmed HbF induction in vivo through an increase in γ-globin gene expression and in the percentage of HbF positive red blood cells. Moreover, TDF showed no cytotoxic effect at HbF inducing concentrations. These data support the potential development of TDF for the treatment of hematological disorders, including β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.

FoxF1 protects rats from paraquat-evoked lung injury following HDAC2 inhibition via the microRNA-342/KLF5/IκB/NF-κB p65 axis,

Abstract: Purpose
Forkhead box f1 (FoxF1), a transcription factor, was implicated in lung development. However, the molecular mechanism of FoxF1 in lung injury, specifically in injury caused by paraquat (PQ), one of the most frequently used herbicides, is unknown. Accordingly, we performed this study to investigate whether FoxF1 attenuates PQ-induced lung injury and to determine the possible mechanism.
Methods
We used PQ-treated Beas-2B cells to measure the expression of FoxF1. Later, ChIP-qPCR was applied to detect the levels of histone acetylation in cells, followed by the validation of the relationship between histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) and FoxF1. Subsequently, the correlation between FoxF1 and microRNA (miR)-342 and the downstream mechanism of miR-342 were evaluated by bioinformatics analysis. The apoptosis and the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PQ-treated cells were detected to evaluate the roles of HDAC2, FoxF1 and miR-342 in vitro. Finally, a rat model was developed to evaluate the effects of HDAC2, miR-342 and Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) on PQ-induced lung injury in vivo.
Results
PQ treatment significantly enhanced FoxF1 promoter deacetylation, thereby inhibiting FoxF1 expression. After inhibition of HDAC2 activity, apoptosis and oxidative stress induced by PQ were significantly reversed. Nevertheless, further inhibition of miR-342 or overexpression of KLF5 promoted apoptosis and oxidative stress induced by PQ, and IκB/NF-κB p65 signaling was significantly activated after PQ treatment.
Conclusion
PQ treatment inhibited miR-342 expression by promoting HDAC2-induced deacetylation of the FoxF1 promoter, thereby promoting KLF5 expression and the IκB/NF-κB p65 signaling activation, and finally exacerbating PQ-induced lung injury in rats.

Abstract: The nod-like receptor protein-3 (NLRP3)-mediated pyroptosis is involved in kidney diseases. Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) directly interacts with NLRP3. This study aimed to probe the mechanism of TXNIP and NLRP3 pathway in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Marker detection and histological staining indicated that in DN rats, the renal function was destroyed, and the TXNIP/NLRP3 axis was activated to induce inflammatory generation and pyroptosis. The protein levels of TXNIP, NLRP3 inflammatory components and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related factors (ATF4, CHOP and IRE1α) were measured. DN rats were injected with LV-TXNIP-shRNA or IRE1α RNase specific inhibitor (STF-083010) to examine ERS- and pyroptosis-related proteins, and renal injury. Silencing TXNIP inhibited the NLRP3 axis and reduced renal damage in DN rats. ERS was activated in DN rats, and miR-200a expression was degraded by IRE1α. miR-200a bound to TXNIP. NRK-52E cells were induced by high glucose (HG) to simulate DN in vitro. The damage and pyroptosis of NRK-52E cells were analyzed. After inhibiting IRE1α, miR-200a expression increased and TXNIP expression decreased. miR-200a inhibition in HG-induced NRK-52E cells partially reversed the reduced pyroptosis by STF-083010. Overall, IRE1α upregulates miR-200a degradation in DN rats, and stimulates the TXINP/NLRP3 pathway-mediated pyroptosis and renal damage.

Abstract: Objective
During the process of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI), the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) continues to increase, leads to the cardiomyocyte apoptosis and eventually causes myocardial damage, while the upstream regulation mechanism of calcium overload is still unknown. This study focuses on the role of miR-219a-2 in MIRI and aims to elaborate its regulatory mechanism on calcium overload that occurs during MIRI.
Methods
The expression of miR-219a-2 was determined in the heart tissues of MIRI mice by qRT-PCR. The [Ca2+]i was measured by fluo-3 using a fluorescence microplate reader. The expression of hypoxiainducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and NR1, the obligatory subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR), were measured by qRT-PCR and western blot. The luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the interplay between miR-219a-2 and HIF1α and the interplay between HIF1α and NR1. The cell apoptosis was measured by the expression level of B-cell lymphoma 2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) and the number of TUNEL-positive cells. The myocardial infarct size of mice was measured by TTC/Evans Blue staining.
Results
MiR-219a-2 was down-regulated in the heart tissues of MIRI mice. miR-219a-2 overexpression decreased [Ca2+]i and the expression of HIF1α and NR1 in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-treated HL-1 cells. Then, the luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-219a-2 inhibited the transcription of HIF1α and HIF1α promoted the transcription of NR1. Both HIF1α overexpression and NMDAR function enhancement removed the inhibitory effect of miR-219a-2 on calcium overload and cell apoptosis in H/R-treated HL-1 cells. Finally, the overexpression of miR-219a-2 decreased Ca2+ concentration, cell apoptosis, and myocardial infarction size in MIRI mice, while the NMDAR function enhancer reversed the therapeutic effect of miR-219a-2.
Conclusion
MiR-219a-2 reducing NMDAR-mediated calcium overload via HIF1α/NR1 axis, thus alleviating cell apoptosis in MIRI.

Abstract: Increased expression of FOXM1 is observed in a variety of human malignancies. The downstream target genes of FOXM1 involved in tumorigenesis and development are not fully elucidated in ovarian cancer. Here, we identified Cyclin F, a substrate recognition subunit of SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) complex, and Kinesin Family Member 20A (KIF20A) were transcriptionally regulated by FOXM1 in ovarian cancer. Accordingly, Cyclin F and KIF20A were commonly overexpressed in ovarian cancer. Functionally, forced expression of Cyclin F or KIF20A significantly enhanced while knockdown of them decreased proliferation and invasion of ovarian cancer cells. Importantly, high levels of Cyclin F and KIF20A correlated with poor prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer. Our findings indicate that Cyclin F and KIF20A are functional targets of FOXM1 which might be potential drug targets in ovarian cancer.

Abstract: MicroRNA (miR) deregulation is frequently seen in colon cancer. In this study, we sought to investigate biological effects of miR-193a on colon cancer and its underlying mechanism. Microarray analysis was conducted to obtain the differentially expressed miRs and their target genes in colon cancer. Bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) were obtained. The functional roles of miR-193a and FAK in colon cancer were determined using loss- and gain-function experiments. The cell proliferation, and migration and invasion were evaluated by CCK-8 and Transwell assay respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the targeting relationship between miR-193a and FAK. Furthermore, in vivo experiment was conducted to test the roles of EV miR-193a in colon cancer growth, followed by determination of PCNA, MMP-2, and MMP-9 protein expression using Western blot analysis. MiR-193a was downregulated, whereas FAK was upregulated in colon cancer. MiR-193a upregulation or FAK downregulation inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. miR-193a could downregulate FAK. Upregulation of EV miR-193a was observed to impede proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by decreased PCNA, MMP-2, and MMP-9 expression. In summary, EV miR-193a derived from MSCs impeded colon cancer progression by targeting FAK, thus suggesting a new potential strategy for colon cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is dynamically regulated by methyltransferases and demethylases. In spermatogenesis, prospermatogonia differentiate into differentiating or undifferentiated spermatogonia after birth. However, the epigenetic regulation of prospermatogonia to spermatogonia transition is largely unknown. We found that perinatal prospermatogonia have extremely low levels of di-methylated H3K9 (H3K9me2) and that H3K9 demethylases, JMJD1A and JMJD1B, catalyze H3K9me2 demethylation in perinatal prospermatogonia. Depletion of JMJD1A and JMJD1B in the embryonic germline resulted in complete loss of male germ cells after puberty, indicating that H3K9me2 demethylation is essential for male germline maintenance. JMJD1A/JMJD1B-depleted germ cells were unable to differentiate into functional spermatogonia. JMJD1 isozymes contributed to activation of several spermatogonial stem cell maintenance genes through H3K9 demethylation during the prospermatogonia to spermatogonia transition, which we propose is key for spermatogonia development. In summary, JMJD1A/JMJD1B-mediated H3K9me2 demethylation promotes prospermatogonia to differentiate into functional spermatogonia by establishing proper gene expression profiles.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we report a method to regulate cellular protein levels by introducing a ubiquitin variant between a destabilizing domain (DD) and the regulated protein. When produced in the absence of a stabilizing ligand the DD dominates and the entire fusion protein is processively degraded by the proteasome. In the presence of the stabilizing ligand the fusion protein is metabolically stable and becomes a substrate for abundant ubiquitin-specific proteases, liberating a native, or a near-native protein-of-interest. This technique is thus particularly useful for the study of proteins whose free N terminus is required for proper function. In addition, removal of the DD in the presence of stabilizing ligand leads to higher expression levels of regulated protein when cells experience transient exposure to a stabilizing ligand, such as in a living animal receiving a single dose of a pharmacological agent as the stabilizing ligand.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations and loss of activity in PARKIN, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). PARKIN regulates many aspects of mitochondrial quality control including mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) and mitochondrial biogenesis. Defects in mitophagy have been hypothesized to play a predominant role in the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in PD. Here, we show that although there are defects in mitophagy in human DA neurons lacking PARKIN, the mitochondrial deficits are primarily due to defects in mitochondrial biogenesis that are driven by the upregulation of PARIS and the subsequent downregulation of PGC-1α. CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown of PARIS completely restores the mitochondrial biogenesis defects and mitochondrial function without affecting the deficits in mitophagy. These results highlight the importance mitochondrial biogenesis versus mitophagy in the pathogenesis of PD due to inactivation or loss of PARKIN in human DA neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Riboswitches are mRNA domains that make gene-regulatory decisions upon binding their cognate ligands. Bacterial riboswitches that specifically recognize 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside 5′-monophosphate (ZMP) and 5′-triphosphate (ZTP) regulate genes involved in folate and purine metabolism. Now, we have developed synthetic ligands targeting ZTP riboswitches by replacing the sugar-phosphate moiety of ZMP with various functional groups, including simple heterocycles. Despite losing hydrogen bonds from ZMP, these analogs bind ZTP riboswitches with similar affinities as the natural ligand, and activate transcription more strongly than ZMP in vitro. The most active ligand stimulates gene expression ∼3 times more than ZMP in a live Escherichia coli reporter. Co-crystal structures of the Fusobacterium ulcerans ZTP riboswitch bound to synthetic ligands suggest stacking of their pyridine moieties on a conserved RNA nucleobase primarily determines their higher activity. Altogether, these findings guide future design of improved riboswitch activators and yield insights into how RNA-targeted ligand discovery may proceed.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are heterogeneous cells of complex nature that show different potentials while different culture conditions can modify their functionalities through interactions with the microenviroment. Here, we found that bone marrow (BM) MSC from different donor sources and passages that expressed higher levels of α6 integrin subunit (ITGA6), showed higher clonogenicity, migration and differentiation potential. ITGA6 showed important roles improving these potentials and regulating proliferation through protein kinase B (AKT) pathway and cell cycle inhibitor proteins p53 and p21. Moreover, ITGA6 downregulation impaired migration. Cell confluence regulated ITGA6, increasing its expression in low density cultures and decreasing in high density cultures. Besides, ITGA6- cells expressed ITGA6 when seeded at low densities. We found higher ITGA6 expression on fibronectin substrates at lower confluency. Fibronectin increased proliferation, clonogenicity, activation of AKT, decreased cell cycle inhibitor proteins and augmented growth factors expression. Spheres-derived MSC showed higher ITGA6 expression and enhanced potentials for migration, clonogenicity and proliferation. In conclusion, though there is an intrinsic regulation of ITGA6 expression, associated to the progenitor potential of BM-MSC, this expression is regulated by culture conditions and is translated in changes in cell behavior and proliferation. This knowledge could be used to enhance the potential of BM-MSC for clinical application.

Kinase activity-independent role of EphA2 in the regulation of M-phase progression,

Abstract: Cell division is a tightly regulated, essential process for cell proliferation. Very recently, we reported that EphA2 is phosphorylated at Ser897, via the Cdk1/MEK/ERK/RSK pathway, during M phase and contributes to proper M-phase progression by maintaining cortical rigidity via the EphA2pSer897/ephexin4/RhoG pathway. Here, we show that EphA2 kinase activity is dispensable for M-phase progression. Although EphA2 knockdown delayed this progression, the delay was rescued by an EphA2 mutant expression with an Asp739 to Asn substitution, as well as by wild-type EphA2. Western blotting analysis confirmed that the Asp739Asn mutant lost its EphA2 kinase activity. Like wild-type EphA2, the Asp739Asn mutant was localized to the plasma membrane irrespective of cell cycle. While RhoG localization to the plasma membrane was decreased in EphA2 knockdown cells, it was rescued by re-expression of wild-type EphA2 but not via the mutant containing the Ser897 to Ala substitution. This confirmed our recent report that phosphorylation at Ser897 is responsible for RhoG localization to the plasma membrane. In agreement with the M-phase progression's rescue effect, the Asp739Asn mutant rescued RhoG localization in EphA2 knockdown cells. These results suggest that EphA2 regulates M-phase progression in a manner independent of its kinase activity.

Abstract: Summary
Glycan recognition is typically studied using free glycans, but glycopeptide presentations represent more physiological conditions for glycoproteins. To facilitate studies of glycopeptide recognition, we developed Glyco-SPOT synthesis, which enables the parallel production of diverse glycopeptide libraries at microgram scales. The method uses a closed system for prolonged reactions required for coupling Fmoc-protected glycoamino acids, including O-, N-, and S-linked glycosides, and release conditions to prevent side reactions. To optimize reaction conditions and sample reaction progress, we devised a biopsy testing method. We demonstrate the efficient utilization of such microscale glycopeptide libraries to determine the specificity of glycan-recognizing antibodies (e.g., CTD110.6) using microarrays, enzyme specificity on-array and in-solution (e.g., ST6GalNAc1, GCNT1, and T-synthase), and binding kinetics using fluorescence polarization. We demonstrated that the glycosylation on these peptides can be expanded using glycosyltransferases both in-solution and on-array. This technology will promote the discovery of biological functions of peptide modifications by glycans.

Abstract: CD8+ T cells are considered a critical component of antitumor immunity. However, tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells may express more than one checkpoint molecules that have the potential to inhibit effector responses alone or cooperatively. Here, we focused on the expression dynamic of TIGIT and PD-1 in CD8+ T cells. TIGIT+ subset presented significantly higher PD-1 expression than TIGIT− subset in circulating CD8+ T cells. The expression dynamic of TIGIT and PD-1 was then tracked. In total CD8+ T cells, TIGIT mRNA increased more rapidly than PD-1 mRNA, and TIGIT+ CD8+ T cells upregulated PD-1 more rapidly than TIGIT− CD8+ T cells. Next, 24-h-stimulated CD8+ T cells were re-sorted into TIGIT+ and TIGIT− subsets, and the TIGIT+ cells that came from TIGIT− cells also presented significantly more rapid PD-1 induction than persistent TIGIT− CD8+ T cells. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, the expression of PD-1 was more enriched in TIGIT+ cells than in TIGIT− cells in both circulating CD8+ T cells and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Function analysis revealed that TIGIT+ CD8 T cells presented lower interferon-gamma, perforin 1, and granzyme B upregulation than TIGIT− CD8 T cells, especially in NSCLC patients. Overall, these data indicated that TIGIT presented earlier expression dynamic than PD-1 in activated CD8+ T cells and was upregulated in NSCLC patients.

Abstract: Increasing evidence has shown that abnormal expression of XPO5 is found in many human cancers and acts as an oncoprotein in certain cancers. However, its functional role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unexplored. In our study, we found that XPO5 was highly expressed in HCC, which was associated with SUMO modification. Moreover, we found that XPO5 was SUMOylated by SUMO2 at K125. Functional experiments revealed that XPO5 SUMOylation could promote MHCC97H cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, we found that the nuclear export of pre-miR-3184 was suppressed by SUMOylated XPO5. Moreover, PLCB1 was identified as the common target of miR-3184-5p and miR-3184-3p. The suppressed phenotype induced by miR-3184-5p and miR-3184-3p could be rescued by overexpression of PLCB1. Bioinformatics analysis showed that PLCB1 expression had a negative relationship with HCC patient survival. The inhibitory effects of MHCC97H cells resulted from abnormal XPO5 SUMO modification could be blocked by miR-3184 inhibitor or PLCB1 overexpression. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of XPO5 in HCC, that is, the SUMOylated XPO5 acts as an “oncogenic” role in MHCC97H cells proliferation, migration and invasion by controlling the nuclear-cytoplasm transportation of miR-3184, thus up-regulating PLCB1 expression.

Abstract: The derivation of human pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines by in vitro reprogramming of somatic cells revolutionized research: iPSCs have been used for disease modeling, drug screening and regenerative medicine for many disorders, especially when combined with cutting-edge genome editing technologies. In hematology, malignant transformation is often a multi-step process, that starts with either germline or acquired genetic alteration, followed by progressive acquisition of mutations combined with the selection of one or more pre-existing clones. iPSCs are an excellent model to study the cooperation between different genetic alterations and to test relevant therapeutic drugs. In this review, we will describe the use of iPSCs for pathophysiological studies and drug testing in inherited and acquired hematological malignancies.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are ubiquitous polypeptides expressed in all living organisms that participate in several basic cellular processes, including protein folding, from which their denomination as molecular chaperones originated. There are several HSPs, including HSPA5, also known as 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) or binding immunoglobulin protein (BIP) that is an ER resident involved in the folding of polypeptides during their translocation into this compartment prior to the transition to the Golgi network. HSPA5 is detected on the surface of cells or secreted into the extracellular environment. Surface HSPA5 has been proposed to have various roles, such as receptor-mediated signal transduction, a co-receptor for soluble ligands, as well as a participant in tumor survival, proliferation, and resistance. Recently, surface HSPA5 has been reported to be a potential receptor of some viruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2. In spite of these observations, the association of HSPA5 within the plasma membrane is still unclear. To gain information about this process, we studied the interaction of HSPA5 with liposomes made of different phospholipids. We found that HSPA5 has a high affinity for negatively charged phospholipids, such as palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphoserine (POPS) and cardiolipin (CL). The N-terminal and C-terminal domains of HSPA5 were independently capable of interacting with negatively charged phospholipids, but to a lesser extent than the full-length protein, suggesting that both domains are required for the maximum insertion into membranes. Interestingly, we found that the interaction of HSPA5 with negatively charged liposomes promotes an oligomerization process via intermolecular disulfide bonds in which the N-terminus end of the protein plays a critical role.

Abstract: Background
This study was aimed to identify an accurate gene expression signature to predict overall survival (OS) in patients with ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods
Expression data and corresponding clinical information were obtained from two independent databases: the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) dataset. Multiple analysis methods including univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis were utilized to build the signature. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analyses were used to assess the predictive accuracy of this gene signature.
Results
A novel 10-gene signature with high predictive accuracy for OS in OC patients was constructed and validated in the training and validation set. Based on the results of univariate and multivariate analyses, the presence of risk Score was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival of OC patients. Moreover, we developed a nomogram model based on these 10 genes in the signature, which also displayed a favorable predictive efficacy for prognosis in OC.
Conclusions
Our results identified a robust 10-gene signature for OC prognosis prediction, which might be applied to assist clinical decision-making and individualized treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor (TF) GATA2 plays a key role in organ development and cell fate control in the central nervous, urogenital, respiratory, and reproductive systems, and in primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. Here, we generate a knockin protein reporter mouse line expressing a GATA2VENUS fusion from the endogenous Gata2 genomic locus, with correct expression and localization of GATA2VENUS in different organs. GATA2VENUS expression is heterogeneous in different hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations (HSPCs), identifies functionally distinct subsets, and suggests a novel monocyte and mast cell lineage bifurcation point. GATA2 levels further correlate with proliferation and lineage outcome of hematopoietic progenitors. The GATA2VENUS mouse line improves the identification of specific live cell types during embryonic and adult development and will be crucial for analyzing GATA2 protein dynamics in TF networks.

Abstract: In this study, we noninvasively assessed whether M2-like macrophages accelerate the progression of ovarian cancer by performing molecular imaging of ovarian cancer cells expressing enhanced firefly luciferase (Effluc) in living mice. First, murine ovarian cancer ID8 cells expressing Effluc (ID8/Effluc cells) were established by retroviral infection. Subsequently, macrophages were isolated from the peritoneal exudate of mice injected with thioglycollate medium and differentiated into M2-like macrophages by adding interleukin 4. To characterize these M2-like macrophages, F4/80 and cluster of differentiation 206 expression levels were determined. Then, the M2-like macrophages were co-cultured with the ID8/Effluc cells and bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of signals from the ID8/Effluc cells was completed. Additionally, migration and wound healing were assessed to evaluate the effects of conditioned medium (CM) from M2-like macrophages on ID8/Effluc cell motility. In the in vivo study, mice were first given either liposome–phosphate-buffered saline or liposome-clodronate (lipo-clodronate). After 24 h, ID8/Effluc cells were intraperitoneally injected into the mice and BLI was completed at the designed time points. Next, histological analysis was conducted to characterize the infiltrated tumor. Flow cytometric analysis revealed high levels of CD206 expression in the differentiated M2-like macrophages. Meanwhile, ID8/Effluc cells co-cultured with these M2-like macrophages proliferated rapidly in an M2-like macrophage, number-dependent manner. The migration of the ID8/Effluc cells was also increased by the application of CM from M2-like macrophages. In vivo BLI revealed that the growth rate of intraperitoneally injected ovarian cancer cells was inhibited following macrophage depletion by treatment with lipo-clodronate. M2-like macrophages accelerated the progression of ovarian cancer, suggesting they are a new therapeutic target for ovarian cancer and that ovarian cancer could be managed by altering the nature of communication between ovarian cancer and macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Lung transplantation can be lifesaving in end-stage cystic fibrosis (CF), but long-term survival is limited by chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). Persistent upper airway Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) colonization can seed the allograft. While de novo PsA infection is associated with CLAD in non-CF recipients, this association is less clear for CF recipients experiencing PsA recolonization. Here, we evaluate host and pathogen contributions to this phenomenon. In the context of PsA infection, brushings from the airways of CF recipients demonstrate type 1 interferon gene suppression. Airway epithelial cell (AEC) cultures demonstrate similar findings in the absence of pathogens or immune cells, contrasting with the pre-transplant CF AEC phenotype. Type 1 interferon promoters are relatively hypermethylated in CF AECs. CF subjects in this cohort have more mucoid PsA, while non-CF PsA subjects have decreased microbiome α diversity. Peri-transplant protocols may benefit from consideration of this host and microbiome equilibrium.
