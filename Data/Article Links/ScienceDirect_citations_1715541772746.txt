Abstract: It has been verified that placenta contains multi-lineage mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We have used a time-gradient attachment method to isolate placenta-derived MSCs (PMSCs). The morphology, differentiation potential, immunogenicity and xenogenic reconstruction potential of these PMSCs were examined. The results showed that PMSCs isolated using the time-gradient attachment method showed higher potential of in vitro proliferation and multi-lineage differentiation. PMSCs isolated using the time-gradient attachment method showed a low immunogenicity. HLA-A gene fragment and no HLA-DR gene fragment were detected in PMSCs isolated using the time-gradient attachment method, and the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay identified that these cells inhibited the proliferation of the allogeneic T-lymphocytes induced by PHA. The transplantation in calvaria of rats showed that PMSCs had the higher xenogenic reconstruction potential. Finally, the significance of PMSCs isolated using the time-gradient attachment method in experimental and clinical applications is discussed.

Abstract: Cardiac fibroblasts are exposed to both cyclic strain and interstitial fluid flow in the myocardium. The balance of these stimuli is affected by fibrotic scarring, during which the fibroblasts transition to a myofibroblast phenotype. The present study investigates the mechanisms by which cardiac fibroblasts seeded in three-dimensional (3D) collagen gels differentiate between strain and fluid flow. Neonatal cardiac fibroblast-seeded 3D collagen gels were exposed to interstitial flow and/or cyclic strain and message levels of collagens type I and III, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were assessed. Flow was found to significantly increase and strain to decrease expression of myofibroblast markers. Corresponding immunofluorescence indicated that flow and strain differentially regulated α-SMA protein expression. The effect of flow was inhibited by exposure to losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker, and by introduction of shRNA constructs limiting AT1R expression. Blocking of TGF-β also inhibited the myofibroblast transition, suggesting that flow-mediated cell signaling involved both AT1R and TGF-β1. Reduced smad2 phosphorylation in response to cyclic strain suggested that TGF-β is part of the mechanism by which cardiac fibroblasts differentiate between strain-induced and flow-induced mechanical stress. Our experiments show that fluid flow and mechanical deformation have distinct effects on cardiac fibroblast phenotype. Our data suggest a mechanism in which fluid flow directly acts on AT1R and causes increased TGF-β1 expression, whereas cyclic strain reduces activation of smad proteins. These results have relevance to the pathogenesis and treatment of heart failure.

Abstract: Invasive tumor cells use proteases to degrade and migrate through the stromal environment consisting of a 3D network of extracellular matrix macromolecules. In particular, MT1-MMP, a membrane-anchored metalloproteinase, is critical during cancer cell invasion. MT1-MMP is stored in endosomal compartments and then delivered to invadopodia, the specialized plasma membrane domains of invasive cancer cells endowed with extracellular matrix-degradation capacity. In macrophages, traffic of MT1-MMP vesicles to invadopodia-related podosomes requires microtubules. We previously found that in breast tumor MDA-MB-231 cells an increase of microtubule and cortactin acetylation upon inhibition of HDAC6 correlates with a decrease of matrix degradation and invasion in three-dimensional collagen I gel. Here, we investigated the role of the recently identified α-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 ATAT1 in invasive MDA-MB-231 cells. We found that the dynamics and distribution of MT1-MMP-positive endosomes require regulation of acetylation levels. We observed that ATAT1 tubulin acetyltransferase binds and regulates cortactin acetylation levels. In addition, ATAT1 colocalizes with cortactin at the adherent surface of the cells and it is required for 2D migration and invasive migration of MDA-MB-231 cells in collagen matrix. All together, our data indicate that a balance of acetylation and deaceylation by ATAT1/HDAC6 enzymes with opposite activities regulates the migratory and invasive capacities of breast tumor cells.

Abstract: Hematopoietic progenitors from murine fetal liver efficiently differentiate in culture into proplatelet-producing megakaryocytes and have proved valuable to study platelet biogenesis. In contrast, megakaryocyte maturation is far less efficient in cultured bone marrow progenitors, which hampers studies in adult animals. It is shown here that addition of hirudin to media containing thrombopoietin and serum yielded a proportion of proplatelet-forming megakaryocytes similar to that in fetal liver cultures (approximately 50%) with well developed extensions and increased the release of platelet particles in the media. The effect of hirudin was maximal at 100U/ml, and was more pronounced when it was added in the early stages of differentiation. Hirugen, which targets the thrombin anion binding exosite I, and argatroban, a selective active site blocker, also promoted proplatelet formation albeit less efficiently than hirudin. Heparin, an indirect thrombin blocker, and OTR1500, a stable heparin-like synthetic glycosaminoglycan generated proplatelets at levels comparable to hirudin. Heparin with low affinity for antithrombin was equally as effective as standard heparin, which indicates antithrombin independent effects. Use of hirudin and heparin compounds should lead to improved culture conditions and facilitate studies of platelet biogenesis in adult mice.

Short-term fibronectin treatment induces endothelial-like and angiogenic properties in monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells: Involvement of intracellular VEGF and MAPK regulation,

Abstract: Fibronectin (FN) is an extracellular matrix protein promoting cell proliferation, adhesion, and survival and is localized in the intimal layer of normal and atherosclerotic blood vessels. Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen-presenting cells located in healthy and diseased intima, and thus may predispose arteries to atherosclerosis. Besides their pro-atherogenic activities DCs can promote neovascularization, by releasing pro-angiogenic mediators and/or by trans-differentiating into endothelial-like cells. Here, we investigated changes in morphology, function and angiogenic properties of monocyte-derived immature DCs (Mo-iDCs) after a short-term FN treatment and some of the signaling pathways involved in these processes. The cells were analyzed by time-lapse, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Within 90min of re-plating, FN induced a swift morphologic transformation of most round iDCs into spindle-shaped iDCs (sp-iDCs). This was characterized by redistribution of mitochondria into dendritic spindles, decreased CD1c, and increased thrombomodulin (CD141) expression. Functionally, sp-iDCs acquired Ulex-europaeus-agglutinin-1 lectin binding, phagocytosis was decreased and intracellular (nuclear and cytosolic) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was increased. FN also induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in round-iDCs, and p38MAPK phosphorylation in sp-iDCs. Inhibiting p38MAPK, but not ERK1/2, restrained the FN-induced transformation into sp-iDCs. Furthermore, FN-treatment of Mo-iDCs induced a paracrine angiogenic effect on endothelial tube formation, which was abolished by inhibiting ERK1/2 or VEGF. Inhibiting p38MAPK had no effect on endothelial tube formation. By contrast, in laminin-treated Mo-iDCs, which had round-shaped morphology, CD1c and CD141 expression was similar to control untreated cells, but intracellular VEGF levels were higher, and endothelial tube formation was an individual trait. We conclude that a short-term FN treatment induced angiogenic intracrine and paracrine properties in Mo-iDCs. This may act as an immediate protective mechanism to maintain vascular homeostasis. Moreover, inducing sp-iDCs by short term FN-treatment or ERK1/2 modulation might be considered as new approaches for regulating angiogenesis through the production/inhibition of pro-angiogenic mediators. Collectively, these findings may support a role for FN and Mo-iDCs in vascular function and angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
During persistent viral infection, adaptive immune responses are suppressed by immunoregulatory factors, contributing to viral persistence. Although this suppression is mediated by inhibitory factors, the mechanisms by which virus-specific T cells encounter and integrate immunoregulatory signals during persistent infection are unclear. We show that a distinct population of IL-10-expressing immunoregulatory antigen-presenting cells (APCs) is amplified during chronic versus acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection and suppresses T cell responses. Although acute LCMV infection induces the expansion of immunoregulatory APCs, they subsequently decline. However, during persistent LCMV infection, immunoregulatory APCs are amplified and parallel the viral replication kinetics. Further characterization demonstrates that immunoregulatory APCs are molecularly and metabolically distinct, and exhibit increased expression of T cell-interacting molecules and negative regulatory factors that suppress T cell responses. Thus, immunoregulatory APCs are amplified during viral persistence and deliver inhibitory signals that suppress antiviral T cell immunity and likely contribute to persistent infection.

Abstract: We describe a novel deletion causing εγδβ thalassemia in a Pakistani family. The Pakistani deletion is 506kb in length, and the second largest εγδβ thalassemia deletion reported to date. It removes the entire β globin gene (HBB) cluster, extending from 431kb upstream to 75kb downstream of the ε globin gene (HBE). The breakpoint junction occurred within a 160bp palindrome embedded in LINE/LTR repeats, and contained a short (9bp) region of direct homology which may have contributed to the recombination event. Characterization of the deletion breakpoints has been particularly challenging due to the complexity of DNA deletion, insertion and inversion, involving a multitude of methodologies, mirroring the changing DNA analysis technologies.

Abstract: It has been previously reported that pretreatment with exogenous heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is able to protect cells and animals from the deleterious effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced by Gram-negative bacteria. However, the effects of Hsp70 pretreatment on lipoteichoic acid (LTA) challenge resulted from Gram-positive bacteria infection have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that preconditioning with human recombinant Hsp70 ameliorates various manifestations of systematic inflammation, including reactive oxygen species, TNFα, and CD11b/CD18 adhesion receptor expression induction observed in different myeloid cells after LTA addition. Therefore, exogenous Hsp70 may provide a mechanism for controlling excessive inflammatory responses after macrophage activation. Furthermore, in a rat model of LTA-induced sepsis, we demonstrated that prophylactic administration of exogenous human Hsp70 significantly exacerbated numerous homeostatic and hemodynamic disturbances induced by LTA challenge and partially normalized the coagulation system and multiple biochemical blood parameters, including albumin and bilirubin concentrations, which were severely disturbed after LTA injections. Importantly, prophylactic intravenous injection of Hsp70 before LTA challenge significantly reduced mortality rates. Thus, exogenous mammalian Hsp70 may serve as a powerful cellular defense agent against the deleterious effects of bacterial pathogens, such as LTA and LPS. Taken together, our findings reveal novel functions of this protein and establish exogenous Hsp70 as a promising pharmacological agent for the prophylactic treatment of various types of sepsis.

Abstract: The Mixl1 homeodomain protein plays a key role in mesendoderm patterning during embryogenesis, but its target genes remain to be identified. We compared gene expression in differentiating heterozygous Mixl1GFP/w and homozygous null Mixl1GFP/Hygro mouse embryonic stem cells to identify potential downstream transcriptional targets of Mixl1. Candidate Mixl1 regulated genes whose expression was reduced in GFP+ cells isolated from differentiating Mixl1GFP/Hygro embryoid bodies included Pdgfrα and Flk1. Mixl1 bound to ATTA sequences located in the Pdgfrα and Flk1 promoters and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed Mixl1 occupancy of these promoters in vivo. Furthermore, Mixl1 transactivated the Pdgfrα and Flk1 promoters through ATTA sequences in a DNA binding dependent manner. These data support the hypothesis that Mixl1 directly regulates Pdgfrα and Flk1 gene expression and strengthens the position of Mixl1 as a key regulator of mesendoderm development during mammalian gastrulation.

ER signaling regulation drives the switch between autophagy and apoptosis in NRK-52E cells exposed to cisplatin,

Abstract: Cisplatin (cisPt) use in chemotherapy is limited by the occurrence of a severe nephrotoxicity. Both autophagy and apoptosis seem to contribute in kidney response to cisPt, however their cross-talk is still controversial, since the role played by autophagy (cytoprotective or harmful) and the cellular site driving their switch, are still unclear. Here, we used a multidisciplinary approach to study the correlation between autophagy and apoptosis in renal NRK-52E cells exposed to cisPt. We showed two “sensitivity-thresholds” to cisPt, stating whether apoptosis or autophagy would develop: 10μM dose of cisPt activated autophagy that preserved cell homeostasis; however 3-methyladenine co-administration affected cell viability and induced apoptosis. In contrast, 50μM cisPt determined cell death by apoptosis, whereas the pre-conditioning with taurine contributed to cell rescue, delaying apoptosis and maintaining autophagy. Hence, autophagy protects NRK-52E cells from cisPt injury. By studying the expression of ER specific hallmarks, such as GRP78, GRP94 and GADD153/CHOP, we found a possible pivotal role of ER signaling modulation in the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis induced by cisPt. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that taurine enhances autophagic protection against apoptosis by reducing ER stress, thus making it possible to develop new strategies to reduce severe cisPt-induced side-effects such as nephrotoxicity.

Abstract: ClpB-cytoplasmic (ClpB-cyt)/Hsp100 is an important chaperone protein in rice. Cellular expression of OsClpB-cyt transcript is governed by heat stress, metal stress, and developmental cues. Transgenic rice plants produced with 2 kb OsClpB-cyt promoter driving Gus reporter gene showed heat- and metal-regulated Gus expression in vegetative tissues and constitutive Gus expression in calli, flowering tissues, and embryonal half of seeds. Rice seedlings regenerated with OsClpB-cyt promoter fragment with deletion of its canonical heat shock element sequence (HSE−273 to −280) showed not only heat shock inducibility of Gus transcript/protein but also constitutive expression of Gus in vegetative tissues. It thus emerges that the only classical HSE present in OsClpB-cyt promoter is involved in repressing expression of OsClpB-cyt transcript under unstressed control conditions. Yeast one-hybrid assays suggested that OsHsfA2c specifically interacts with OsClpB-cyt promoter. OsHsfA2c also showed binding with OsClpB-cyt and OsHsfB4b showed binding with OsClpB-cyt; notably, interaction of OsHsfB4b was seen for all three OsClpB/Hsp100 protein isoforms (i.e., ClpB-cytoplasmic, ClpB-mitochondrial, and ClpB-chloroplastic). Furthermore, OsHsfB4b showed interaction with OsHsfA2c. This study suggests that OsHsfA2c may play a role as transcriptional activator and that OsHsfB4b is an important part of this heat shock responsive circuitry.

Abstract: Cell therapy has enormous potential to restore neurological function after stroke. The present study investigated effects of conditionally immortalised neural stem cells (ciNSCs), the Maudsley hippocampal murine neural stem cell line clone 36 (MHP36), on sensorimotor and histological outcome in mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Adult male C57BL/6 mice underwent MCAO by intraluminal thread or sham surgery and MHP36 cells or vehicle were implanted into ipsilateral cortex and caudate 2days later. Functional recovery was assessed for 28days using cylinder and ladder rung tests and tissue analysed for plasticity, differentiation and infarct size. MHP36-implanted animals showed accelerated and augmented functional recovery and an increase in neurons (MAP-2), synaptic plasticity (synaptophysin) and axonal projections (GAP-43) but no difference in astrocytes (GFAP), oligodendrocytes (CNPase), microglia (IBA-1) or lesion volumes when compared to vehicle group. This is the first study showing a potential functional benefit of the ciNSCs, MHP36, after focal MCAO in mice, which is probably mediated by promoting neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity and axonal projections and opens up opportunities for future exploitation of genetically altered mice for dissection of mechanisms of stem cell based therapy.

Abstract: The in vitro neuralization of hESCs has been widely used to generate central and peripheral nervous system components from neural precursors (Bajpai et al., 2009; Curchoe et al., 2010), most often through an intermediate “rosette” stage. Here we confirm that hESC derived neuro-epithelial rosettes express many characteristics of the developing embryonic neural plate (Aaku-Saraste et al., 1996), characterized by expression of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and N-Cadherin. Moreover, neuro-epithelial rosettes display a characteristic acetylated alpha tubulin cytoskeletal arrangement (similar to that observed in the developing embryonic neural plate) (Bhattacharyya et al., 1994). Demonstrated here for the first time MKLP was observed in a hESC model system. We found MKLP expression in small particles in between mitotic spindles, large particles aggregating in the lumen of neuroepithelial rosettes, and we did not observe MKLP in the nucleus of hESC derived neural precursors as previously described in the HeLa cell line. We observed MKLP+ particles in aggregations in the lumen of “early” rosette structures. Furthermore, we observed that MKLP+ particle aggregations can also be lost from the lumens of hESC derived neuro-epithelial rosettes, similar to a phenomenon observed in the developing neural tube in vivo (Marzesco et al., 2005). We determined that this loss of MKLP+ particles occurs from “late” as opposed to “early” stage neuro-epithelial rosettes (characterized by junction type). Disrupting the apical-basal polarization of “early” stage rosettes with a 1% Matrigel overlay (Krtolica et al., 2007) nearly ablates MKLP particle aggregation in the lumen of rosettes, demonstrating that the apical-basal polarity of early NE cells is necessary for lumenal MKLP particle aggregation. We conclude that early hESC derived neuro-epithelial rosettes can model early neurulation events, such as the transition from neural plate like cells to neural tube like cells (i.e. symmetric to asymmetric NE cell division) demonstrated by polarized MKLP particle inheritance and distribution using junction type as a measure of stage.

Abstract: It remains unexplored in what way osteogenic stimulation with dexamethasone, ascorbic acid and β-glycerol phosphate (DAG) influences the process of mineralization, the composition and structure of the assembled mineral. Therefore, we analyzed and characterized biomineralization in DAG-stimulated and unstimulated 3D human unrestricted somatic stem cell (USSC) cultures. Microspheres were analyzed by histological staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), semi-quantitative energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), quantitative wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and Raman spectroscopy. Mineral material was detected by SEM and histological staining in both groups, and showed structural differences. DAG influenced the differentiation of USSCs and the formation, structure and composition of the assembled mineral. SEM showed that cells of the +DAG spheres exhibited morphological signs of osteoblast-like cells. EDX and WDX confirmed a Ca–P mineral in both groups. Overall, the mineral material found showed structural similarities to the mineral substance of bony material.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to establish a murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) line for isolation of functional ventricular cardiomyocytes (VCMs) and then to characterize the derived VCMs. By crossing the myosin light chain 2v (Mlc2v)-Cre mouse line with the reporter strain Rosa26-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), we generated mESC lines from these double transgenic mice, in which Cre-mediated removal of a stop sequence results in the expression of YFP under the control of the ubiquitously active Rosa26 promoter specifically in the VCM. After induction of differentiation via embryoid body (EB) formation, contracting YFP+ cells were detected within EBs and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. N-cadherin, the cadherin expressed in cardiomyocytes, and the major cardiac connexin (Cx) isoform, Cx43, were detected in the respective adherens and gap junctions in these VCMs. Using current clamp recordings we demonstrated that mESC-derived VCMs exhibited action potential characteristics comparable to those of neonatal mouse VCMs. Real-time intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i imaging showed rhythmic intracellular calcium transients in these VCMs. The amplitude and frequency of calcium transients were increased by isoproterenol stimulation, suggesting the existence of functional β-adrenergic signaling. Moreover, [Ca2+]i oscillations responded to increasing frequencies of external electrical stimulation, indicating that VCMs have functional excitation–contraction coupling, a key factor for the ultimate cardiac contractile performance. The present study makes possible the production of homogeneous and functional VCMs for basic research as well as for cardiac repair and regeneration.

Abstract: Here we demonstrate that a dramatic actin polymerizing activity caused by ectopic expression of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin 1 that results in extensive filopodia formation is due to the presence of a lysine rich sequence motif immediately at the cytoplasmic side of the transmembrane domain of the protein. This polybasic sequence interacts with anionic phospholipids in vitro, and, consequently, the actin remodeling caused by this sequence is interfered with by expression of a phosphatidyl inositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2)-targeted phosphatase, suggesting that it intervenes with the function of PIP2-binding actin control proteins. The activity drastically alters the behavior of a range of cultured cells including the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and primary cortical mouse neurons, and, since the sequence is conserved also in synaptotagmin 2, it may reflect an important fine-tuning role for these two proteins during synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.

Abstract: The Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (SFKs) has been shown to play an intricate role in embryonic stem (ES) cell maintenance. In the present study we have focused on the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for the vastly different effects induced by various commonly used SFK inhibitors. We show that several diverse cell types, including fibroblasts completely lacking SFKs, cannot undergo mitosis in response to SU6656 and that this is caused by an unselective inhibition of Aurora kinases. In contrast, PP2 and PD173952 block motility immediately upon exposure and forces cells to grow in dense colonies. The subsequent halt in proliferation of fibroblast and epithelial cells in the center of the colonies approximately 24h post-treatment appears to be caused by cell-to-cell contact inhibition rather than a direct effect of SFK kinase inhibition. Interestingly, in addition to generating more homogenous and dense ES cell cultures, without any diverse effect on proliferation, PP2 and PD173652 also promote ES cell self-renewal by reducing the small amount of spontaneous differentiation typically observed under standard ES cell culture conditions. These effects could not be mirrored by the use of Gleevec, a potent inhibitor of c-Abl and PDGFR kinases that are also inhibited by PP2.

Abstract: The long-term evolution of familial myeloproliferative neoplasms was studied in 93 families with 227 subjects including 97 with polycythemia vera (PV), 105 essential thrombocythemia (ET), 14 primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and 11 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In PV patients, with 12years of median follow-up, overall survival was 83% at 10years and 37% at 20years. A high JAK2V617F allele burden was correlated with the transformation to myelofibrosis (p<0.0001), but not with the transformation to acute leukemia. Among the 105 ET, with 8years of median follow-up, overall survival was 83% at 10years and 57% at 20years. Progression to acute leukemia and progression to myelofibrosis were 10% and 13%. There was a trend toward a more frequent evolution to myelofibrosis when the JAK2V617F mutated allele burden was >50% (p=0.09), but not to AML. Hematologic transformation of the MPN was responsible for 69% of the deaths, cerebral stroke for 7% and 4% died of myocardial infarction. Eleven JAK2V617F mutated patients developed 13 deep splanchnic thromboses in PV and ET. Finally whereas patients with familial PV and ET have a comparable prognosis to non‐familial MPN, the JAK2V617F mutation was associated with a more frequent occurrence of thrombosis in the entire population.

Abstract: Leukocytes migrate through most tissues in the body, a process which takes place in 3D environments. We have previously shown that macrophages use the amoeboid migration mode in porous matrices such as fibrillar collagen I and the mesenchymal mode involving podosomes and matrix proteolysis in dense matrices such as Matrigel. Whether such a plasticity may apply to other leukocytes and to all subsets of macrophages is unknown. Here, we therefore provide a comparative analysis of the in vitro 3D migration modes adopted by primary human leukocytes. Blood-derived monocytes, neutrophils and T lymphocytes were found to use the amoeboid mode in a porous fibrillar collagen I matrix but were unable to infiltrate dense Matrigel and to form podosomes. M2-polarized macrophages and elicited peritoneal macrophages formed podosome rosettes, degraded the ECM and infiltrated both matrices. In contrast, M1 macrophages were motionless in 2D and 3D environments, whilst resident macrophages, devoid of podosomes, were only able to use the amoeboid mode. Thus, we conclude that whereas all leukocytes use the amoeboid mode to migrate through porous matrices, it is only certain macrophages that can adopt the mesenchymal mode that permits migration through dense matrices. Interestingly, the acquisition of mesenchymal migration capacity by macrophages correlates with the presence of podosomes and with their capacity to organize those as rosettes, which appears to be modulated by their differentiation and polarization states. As a perspective, specific control of the mesenchymal migration would be a potential target for therapeutic approaches aiming at decreasing macrophage tissue infiltration.

Abstract: We previously demonstrated that ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) is mitogenic for fibroblasts and macrophages. However, the mechanisms involved in this action were only partially described. Here, we demonstrate that C1P stimulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, and that ROS are required for the mitogenic effect of C1P. ROS production was dependent upon prior activation of NADPH oxidase by C1P, which was determined by measuring phosphorylation of the p40phox subunit and translocation of p47phox from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. In addition, C1P activated cytosolic calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 and protein kinase C-α, and NADPH oxidase activation was blocked by selective inhibitors of these enzymes. These inhibitors, and inhibitors of ROS production, blocked the mitogenic effect of C1P. By using BHNB-C1P (a photolabile caged-C1P analog), we demonstrate that all of these C1P actions are caused by intracellular C1P. It can be concluded that the enzyme responsible for C1P-stimulated ROS generation in bone marrow-derived macrophages is NADPH oxidase, and that this enzyme is downstream of PKC-α and cPLA2-α in this pathway.

Abstract: Calcineurin is an important signalling protein in a plethora of Ca2+-regulated cellular processes. In contrast to what is known about the function of calcineurin in various organisms, information on calcineurin substrates is still limited. Here we describe the identification and characterisation of the transcription factor activated by calcineurin (TacA) in the model organism Dictyostelium discoideum. TacA is a putative zinc-finger transcription factor orthologue of yeast Crz1. In resting unstimulated cells the protein is located in the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus in a calcineurin-dependent manner after Ca2+-stimulation. Nuclear export of TacA is partially dependent on GskA, the Dictyostelium orthologue of mammalian GSK3. The expression of tacA is developmentally regulated with its kinetics roughly paralleling calcineurin regulation. Silencing of tacA via RNAi leads to developmental defects and dysregulation of developmentally regulated and Ca2+-regulated marker genes. Additionally, TacA is involved in the stress response of D. discoideum during development in a separate pathway to the well-known stress response in Dictyostelium via STATc. Finally we provide evidence that TacA is not only an orthologue of yeast Crz1 but also functionally related to mammalian NFAT.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to assess whether a lymphocyte heat shock response and altered heat tolerance to ex vivo heat shock is evident during acclimation. We aimed to use flow cytometry to assess the CD3+CD4+ T lymphocyte cell subset. We further aimed to induce acclimation using moderately stressful daily exercise-heat exposures to achieve acclimation. Eleven healthy males underwent 11 days of heat acclimation. Subjects walked for 90 min (50 ± 8% VO2max) on a treadmill (3.5 mph, 5% grade), in an environmental chamber (33°C, 30–50% relative humidity). Rectal temperature (°C), heart rate (in beats per minute), rating of perceived exertion , thermal ratings, hydration state, and sweat rate were measured during exercise and recovery. On days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 11, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from pre- and post-exercise blood samples. Intracellular and surface HSP70 (SPA-820PE, Stressgen, Assay Designs), and annexin V (ab14085, Abcam Inc.), as a marker of early apoptosis, were measured on CD3+ and CD4+ (sc-70624, sc-70670, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) gated lymphocytes. On day 10, subjects experienced 28 h of sleep loss. Heat acclimation was verified with decreased post-exercise rectal temperature, heart rate, and increased sweat rate on day 11, versus day 1. Heat acclimation was achieved in the absence of significant changes in intracellular HSP70 mean fluorescence intensity and percent of HSP70+ lymphocytes during acclimation. Furthermore, there was no increased cellular heat tolerance during secondary ex vivo heat shock of the lymphocytes acquired from subjects during acclimation. There was no effect of a mild sleep loss on any variable. We conclude that our protocol successfully induced physiological acclimation without induction of cellular heat shock responses in lymphocytes and that added mild sleep loss is not sufficient to induce a heat shock response.

Abstract: UBR1 and UBR2 are N-recognin ubiquitin ligases that function in the N-end rule degradation pathway. In yeast, the UBR1 homologue also functions by N-end rule independent means to promote degradation of misfolded proteins generated by treatment of cells with geldanamycin, a small molecule inhibitor of Hsp90. Based on these studies we examined the role of mammalian UBR1 and UBR2 in the degradation of protein kinase clients upon Hsp90 inhibition. Our findings show that protein kinase clients Akt and Cdk4 are still degraded in mouse Ubr1−/− cells treated with geldanamycin, but that their levels recover much more rapidly than is found in wild type cells. These findings correlate with increased induction of Hsp90 expression in the Ubr1−/− cells compared with wild type cells. We also observed a reduction of UBR1 protein levels in geldanamycin-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human breast cancer cells, suggesting that UBR1 is an Hsp90 client. Further studies revealed a functional overlap between UBR1 and the quality control ubiquitin ligase, CHIP. Our findings show that UBR1 function is conserved in controlling the levels of Hsp90-dependent protein kinases upon geldanamycin treatment, and suggest that it plays a role in determining the sensitivity of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic effects of Hsp90 inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Salmonella Typhimurium causes diarrhea by infecting the epithelium and lamina propria of the intestinal mucosa and by secreting various effector proteins through type III secretion systems (TTSSs). However, the mechanisms by which Salmonella transverses the epithelium and is subsequently released into the lamina propria are poorly understood. Using a murine Salmonella-diarrhea model and in vivo microscopy, we show that epithelial traversal requires TTSS-1-mediated invasion and TTSS-2-dependent trafficking to the basolateral side. After being released into the lamina propria, the bacterium is transiently extracellular before being taken up by phagocytes, including CD11c+CX3CR1high monocytic phagocytes (MPs), which were found to constitutively sample cellular material shed from the basolateral side of the epithelium. Thus, Salmonella infects the cecal mucsa through a step-wise process wherein the bacterium transverses the epithelium through TTSS-2-dependent trafficking and then likely exploits lamina propria MPs, which are sampling the epithelium, to enter and replicate within the host.

Abstract: While damaged peripheral nerves demonstrate some potential to regenerate, complete functional recovery remains infrequent, owing to a functional loss of supportive Schwann cells distal to the injury. An emerging solution to improve upon this intrinsic regenerative capacity is to supplement injured nerves with stem cells derived from various tissues. While many of these strategies have proven successful in animal models, few studies have examined the behavior of transplanted stem cells in vivo, including whether they survive and differentiate. In previous work, we demonstrated that cells derived from neonatal rodent dermis (skin-derived precursor cells, or SKPs) could improve regenerative parameters when transplanted distal to both acute and chronic nerve injuries in Lewis rats. The aim of this work was to track the fate of these cells in various nerve injury paradigms and determine the response of these cells to a known glial growth factor. Here, we report that SKPs survive, respond to local cues, differentiate into myelinating Schwann cells, and avoid complete clearance by the host's immune defenses for a minimum of 10weeks. Moreover, the ultimate fate of SKPs in vivo depends on the nerve environment into which they are injected and can be modified by inclusion of heregulin-1β.

Abstract: The vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) functions in nervous system development and regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. Neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y and Neuro2a or N2A) exposed to atRA undergo growth inhibition and neuronal differentiation, both of which are preceded by an increase in Clmn mRNA. Treatment of N2A cells with atRA produces a reduction in phosphohistone 3 immunostaining and BrdU incorporation, both indicators of a reduction in cell proliferation. These effects are nearly eliminated in atRA-treated shClmn knockdown cells. Loss of Clmn in the mouse N2A cell line also results in a significant reduction of atRA-mediated neurite outgrowth, a response that can be rescued by reintroduction of the Clmn sequence. In contrast, ectopic overexpression of Clmn produces an increase in the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p21Cip1, a decrease in cyclin D1 protein and an increase in hypophosphorylated Rb, showing that Clmn participates in G1/S arrest. Clmn overexpression alone is sufficient to inhibit N2A cell proliferation, whereas both Clmn and atRA must be present to induce neurite outgrowth. This study shows that the atRA-responsive gene Clmn promotes exit from the cell cycle, a requisite event for neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Assembly of a scaffold consisting of CARD9, BCL10, and MALT1 (CBM complex) is critical for effective signaling by multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Dectin and RIG-I. The RUN domain Beclin-1-interacting cysteine-rich-containing Rubicon protein associates constitutively with the Beclin-UVRAG-Vps34 complex under normal conditions to regulate autophagy. Rubicon also interacts with the phagocytic NADPH-oxidase complex upon TLR stimulation to induce potent antimicrobial responses. Here, we show Rubicon is a physiological feedback inhibitor of CBM-mediated PRR signaling, preventing unbalanced proinflammatory responses. Upon Dectin-1- or RIG-I-mediated activation, Rubicon dynamically exchanges binding partners from 14-3-3β to CARD9 in a stimulation-specific and phosphorylation-dependent manner, disassembling the CBM signaling complex and ultimately terminating PRR-induced cytokine production. Remarkably, Rubicon's actions in the autophagy complex, phagocytosis complex, and CBM complex are functionally and genetically separable. Rubicon thus differentially targets signaling complexes, depending on environmental stimuli, and may function to coordinate various immune responses against microbial infection.

Abstract: Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a rare inherited bone-marrow failure syndrome with high clinical heterogeneity. Cells derived from DC patients present short telomeres at early ages, as a result of mutations in genes encoding components of the telomerase complex (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NHP2 and NOP10), or the shelterin complex (TINF2). However, mutations have been identified only in around 50% of the cases, indicating that other genes could be involved in the development of this disease. Indeed, mutations in TCBA1 or chromosome segment C16orf57 have been described recently. We have used HRM technology to perform genetic analysis in the above mentioned genes, in Spanish patients showing both, some clinical features of DC and short telomeres. The mutations have been identified by PCR amplification of DC genes followed by high resolution melting (HRM) and direct DNA sequencing analysis. We have identified seven new families with DC, three with X-linked DC and four with autosomal dominant DC, in which we have found two novel mutations in DKC1 (p.His68Arg and p.Lys390del) and four novel mutations in TERT gene (p.Pro530Leu, p.Arg698Trp, p.Arg971His and p.Arg698Gln). The results show that the use of HRM analysis enables a rapid and inexpensive identification of mutations in dyskeratosis congenita associated genes.

Abstract: Cathepsin H is a unique member of the cysteine cathepsins that acts primarily as an aminopeptidase. Like other cysteine cathepsins, it is synthesized as an inactive precursor and activated by proteolytic removal of its propeptide. Here we demonstrate that, in human cells, the processing of the propeptide is an autocatalytic, multistep process proceeding from an inactive 41kDa pro-form, through a 30kDa intermediate form, to the 28kDa mature form. Tyr87P and Gly90P were identified as the two major endopeptidase cleavage sites, converting the 30kDa form into the mature 28kDa form. The level of processing differs significantly in different human cell lines. In monocyte-derived macrophages U937 and prostate cancer cells PC-3, the 28kDa form is predominant, whereas in osteoblasts HOS the processing from the 30kDa form to the 28kDa form is significantly lower. The aminopeptidase activity of the enzyme and its subcellular localization are independent of the product, however the 30kDa form was not secreted in HOS cells. The activity of the resulting cathepsin H in U937 cells was significantly lower than that in HOS cells, presumably due to the high levels of endogenous cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin F present specifically in this cell line. These results provide an insight into the dependence of human cathepsin H processing and regulation on cell type.

Abstract: Recent reports have showed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor resulted in multidrug resistance (MDR) to other chemotherapeutic agents. However, the molecular mechanisms of Class I HDACs on MDR regulation are poorly understood. In this study, HDAC1 and HDAC2 acted as enhancers to intensify the chemosensitivities of anti-cancer drugs via reducing the expression levels of P-gp, MRP1 and MRP2. Furthermore, the dissociation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 led to transcriptional regulation of P-gp expression via the recruitment of p300, PCAF and NF-Y to the P-gp promoter region, which subsequently increased the level of the active gene marker, hyperacetylated histone H3. In parallel, selective inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 induced the recruitment of p300, PCAF, NF-Y via acetylation of Sp1. Thus, our findings showed HDAC1 and 2 regulated P-gp expression through dynamic changes in chromatin structure and transcription factor association within the promoter region.

Abstract: The dysferlinopathies (e.g. LGMD2b, Myoshi myopathy) are progressive, adult-onset muscle wasting syndromes caused by mutations in the gene coding for dysferlin. Dysferlin is a large (~200kDa) membrane-anchored protein, required for maintenance of plasmalemmal integrity in muscle fibers. To facilitate analysis of dysferlin function in muscle cells, we have established a dysferlin-deficient myogenic cell line (GREG cells) from the A/J mouse, a genetic model for dysferlinopathy. GREG cells have no detectable dysferlin expression, but proliferate normally in growth medium and fuse into functional myotubes in differentiation medium. GREG myotubes exhibit deficiencies in plasma membrane repair, as measured by laser wounding in the presence of FM1–43 dye. Under the wounding conditions used, the majority (~66%) of GREG myotubes lack membrane repair capacity, while no membrane repair deficiency was observed in dysferlin-normal C2C12 myotubes, assayed under the same conditions. We discuss the possibility that the observed heterogeneity in membrane resealing represents genetic compensation for dysferlin deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
The opportunistic gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of pneumonia and sepsis. Staphylococcal α-toxin, a prototypical pore-forming toxin, is a major virulence factor of S. aureus clinical isolates, and lung epithelial cells are highly sensitive to α-toxin's cytolytic activity. Type I interferon (IFN) signaling activated in response to S. aureus increases pulmonary cell resistance to α-toxin, but the underlying mechanisms are uncharacterized. We show that IFNα protects human lung epithelial cells from α-toxin-induced intracellular ATP depletion and cell death by reducing extracellular ATP leakage. This effect depends on protein palmitoylation and induction of phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1). IFNα-induced PLSCR1 associates with the cytoskeleton after exposure to α-toxin, and cellular depletion of PLSCR1 negates IFN-induced protection from α-toxin. PLSCR1-deficient mice display enhanced sensitivity to inhaled α-toxin and an α-toxin-producing S. aureus strain. These results uncover PLSCR1 activity as part of an innate protective mechanism to a bacterial pore-forming toxin.

Abstract: The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is critical to mediating the body's response to stress. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) plays a central role in controlling the stress response and regulating the HPA axis. Recent findings support CRH participates in the stress-induced hippocampal neuron apoptosis, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Our present study demonstrates that CRH can independently decrease hippocampal neuron cell viability in vitro in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) is involved in CRH-induced neuron apoptosis. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response marker, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), either protein or mRNA, is significantly elevated after treatment of CRH, and decreased when co-treated with salubrinal, ER stress inhibitor. The ER stress associated proapoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and cleavage of caspase-12 protein expression are also increased following CRH treatment. Furthermore, we investigate which ER stress cascades are affected by CRH. CRH activates inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), and c-jun kinase (JNK). Neuron apoptotic rate, examined by flow cytometry, is increased when CRH treatment and attenuated by salubrinal, thioredoxin (ASK1 inhibitor) and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor). Therefore, current data indicate that ER stress, through activating the IRE1/ASK1/JNK cascade, plays an important role in CRH-induced neuron apoptosis.

Abstract: Pancreatic islet α-cell development and glucagon production are mainly regulated by Pax6 in the homeobox gene families. However, the molecular mechanism fine-tuning the regulation of these events in α-cell still remains unclear. In ocular cells, Pax6 transcription is regulated by CTCF through its binding to specific sites in Pax6 promoter. In this study, CTCF-mediated regulations of islet α-cell development and glucagon production were investigated in both CTCF transgenic mice and α-TC-1-6 cells. Over-expression of CTCF in transgenic mice affected development of pancreatic islets by significantly suppressing α-cell population in both embryonic and adult pancreases. The effect of CTCF on Pax6 gene expression and subsequently, on pro-glucagon production was however, examined in pancreatic islet α-cells. Over-expression and knock-down of CTCF directly affected Pax6 expression. More importantly, the CTCF binding sites upstream from Pax6 p0 promoter were required for regulating p0 promoter activity in islet α-cells. Stimulation of α-cells with insulin resulted in a significant increase in CTCF expression and a decrease in Pax6 expression, and consequently suppressed pro-glucagon expression. In contrast, these insulin-induced effects were blocked by knockdown of CTCF mRNA with specific siRNA in α-cells. Altogether, our results demonstrated for the first time that CTCF functions as a switch-like molecule between the insulin signaling and the regulations of Pax6 and glucagon expression in pancreatic islet α-cells.

Abstract: Inflammatory responses are complex events occurring when the host immune system fights against invading pathogens, which are double-edged swords requiring appropriate control. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), emerging as a new layer of gene-regulation mechanism, have been reported to have crucial effects on inflammation. In the current study, we identified miR-34a, previously known for its potent tumor suppressive role, to be a novel inflammation regulator. We found that the expression of miR-34a was downregulated in macrophages after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. MiR-34a mimics decreased, while the inhibition of miR-34a increased, the expression of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-<alpha> (TNF-<alpha>) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in LPS treated RAW264.7 cells. Bioinformatics predictions revealed a potential binding site of miR-34a in 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of Notch1 and it was further confirmed by luciferase assay. Moreover, both the mRNA and protein level of Notch1 were downregulated by miR-34a in RAW264.7. Subsequently, knockdown of Notch1 with either genetic or pharmacological inhibition exhibited similar effects as miR-34a mimics on LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory response. Furthermore, the NF-κB activation induced by LPS was also significantly suppressed by miR-34a. These results together identify, for the first time, miR-34a as a negative regulator in LPS-induced inflammation at least partially by targeting Notch1. Besides extending the knowledge of miR-34a from tumor suppressor to inflammation regulator, this study also provides an implication that compounds which can enhance miR-34a expression or miR-34a itself may hold a promise in anti-inflammatory drugs development.

Abstract: The Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) transcription coactivator plays multiple roles in regulating transcription because of the presence of functionally independent modules of subunits within the complex. We have recently identified a role for the ubiquitin protease activity of SAGA in regulating tissue-specific gene expression in Drosophila. Here, we discuss the modular nature of SAGA and the different mechanisms through which SAGA is recruited to target promoters. We propose that the genes sensitive to loss of the ubiquitin protease activity of SAGA share functional characteristics that require deubiquitination of monoubiquitinated histone H2B (ubH2B) for full activation. We hypothesize that deubiquitination of ubH2B by SAGA destabilizes promoter nucleosomes, thus enhancing recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to weak promoters. In addition, SAGA-mediated deubiquitination of ubH2B may facilitate binding of factors that are important for the transition of paused Pol II into transcription elongation.

Abstract: p48 is a long isoform of the ErbB3 binding protein that has oncogenic functions including promotion of carcinogenesis and induction of malignant transformation through negative regulation of tumor suppressor p53. Here, we show that high level of p48 protein expression leads to enhance HDM2 phosphorylation by Akt and inhibits the self-ubiquitination of HDM2 by up-regulation of Akt activity, thereby promoting its protein stability. Moreover, p48 expression leads to accumulated nuclear localization of HDM2, whereas p48 depletion disturbs its nuclear localization. Hence, higher expression of p48 in cancer cells reduces p53 levels through modulation of HDM2 nuclear localization and protein stability via regulation of its Akt-mediated phosphorylation.

Abstract: In animals, hypoxic preconditioning has been used as a form of neuroprotection. The exact mechanism involved in neuroprotective hypoxic preconditioning has not been described, yet could be valuable for possible neuroprotective strategies. The overexpression of the cystine-glutamate exchanger, system Xc−, has been demonstrated as being neuroprotective (Shih, Erb et al. 2006). Here, using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that C57BL/6 mice exposed to hypoxia showed an increase in system Xc− expression, with the highest level of intensity in the hippocampus. Western Blot analysis also showed an almost 2-fold increase in system Xc− protein in hypoxia-exposed versus control mice. The mRNA for the regulatory subunit of system Xc−, xCT, and the xCT/actin ratio were also increased under hypoxic conditions. Experiments using hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α) siRNA showed a statistically significant decrease in HIF-1α and system Xc− expression. Under hypoxic conditions, system Xc− activity, as determined by cystine uptake, increased 2-fold. Importantly, hypoxic preconditioning was attenuated in neural stem cells by pharmacological inhibition of system Xc− activity with S4-carboxyphenylglycine. These data provide the first evidence of hypoxic regulation of the cystine glutamate exchanger system Xc−.

Abstract: Epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) play a key role in initiation and regulation of immune responses. Whereas LC migration out of the epidermis upon environmental assault is extensively studied, the mechanisms involved in the (re)population of the epidermis with LC are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the immigration of LC derived from the human MUTZ-3 cell line (MUTZ-LC) into the epidermis of a full thickness skin equivalent, comprising a fully differentiated epidermis on a fibroblast-populated dermis. MUTZ-LC were used to determine which epidermis-derived chemokines play a role in mediating LC trans-dermal migration into the epidermis. We found evidence for a role of keratinocyte-derived CCL5 and CCL20 in the chemo-attraction of MUTZ-LC. Neutralizing antibodies against CCL5 and CCL20 blocked LC migration towards keratinocytes. Secretion of these two chemokines was associated with incorporation of MUTZ-LC into the epidermis of full thickness skin equivalents. In conclusion, our findings suggest that epidermis derived CCL5 and CCL20 are pivotal mediators in recruitment of LC into the epidermis.

Abstract: The protein p14ARF is a known tumor suppressor protein controlling cell proliferation and survival, which mainly localizes in nucleoli. However, the regulatory mechanisms that govern its activity or expression remain unclear. Here, we report that a novel proapoptotic nucleolar protein, PANO, modulates the expression and activity of p14ARF in HeLa cells. Overexpression of PANO enhances the stability of p14ARF protein by protecting it from degradation, resulting in an increase in p14ARF expression levels. Overexpression of PANO also induces apoptosis under low serum conditions. This effect is dependent on the nucleolar localization of PANO and inhibited by knocking-down p14ARF. Alternatively, PANO siRNA treated cells exhibit a reduction in p14ARF protein levels. In addition, ectopic expression of PANO suppresses the tumorigenicity of HeLa cells in nude mice. These results indicate that PANO is a new apoptosis-inducing gene by modulating the tumor suppressor protein, p14ARF, and may itself be a new candidate tumor suppressor gene.

Abstract: The evolutionary conserved transmembrane protein Crumbs (Crb) regulates morphogenesis of photoreceptor cells in the compound eye of Drosophila and prevents light-dependent retinal degeneration. Here we examine the role of Crb in the ocelli, the simple eyes of Drosophila. We show that Crb is expressed in ocellar photoreceptor cells, where it defines a stalk membrane apical to the adherens junctions, similar as in photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes. Loss of function of crb disrupts polarity of ocellar photoreceptor cells, and results in mislocalisation of adherens junction proteins. This phenotype is more severe than that observed in mutant photoreceptor cells of the compound eye, and resembles more that of embryonic epithelia lacking crb. Similar as in compound eyes, crb protects ocellar photoreceptors from light induced degeneration, a function that depends on the extracellular portion of the Crb protein. Our data demonstrate that the function of crb in photoreceptor development and homeostasis is conserved in compound eyes and ocelli and underscores the evolutionarily relationship between these visual sense organs of Drosophila. The data will be discussed with respect to the difference in apico-basal organisation of these two cell types.

Abstract: HSP40 family member MRJ (DNAJB6) has been in the spot light for its relevance to Huntington's, Parkinson's diseases, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, placental development, neural stem cells, cell cycle and malignancies such as breast cancer and melanoma. This gene has two spliced variants coding for 2 distinct proteins with significant homology. However, MRJ(L) (large variant) is predominantly localized to the nucleus whereas MRJ(S) (small variant) is predominantly cytoplasmic. Interestingly MRJ(S) translocates to the nucleus in response to heat shock. The classical heat shock proteins respond to crises (stress) by increasing the number of molecules, usually by transcriptional up-regulation. Our studies imply that a quick increase in the molar concentration of MRJ in the nuclear compartment is a novel method by which MRJ responds to stress. We found that MRJ(S) shows NLS (nuclear localization signal) independent nuclear localization in response to heat shock and hypoxia. The specificity of this response is realized due to lack of such response by MRJ(S) when challenged by other stressors, such as some cytokines or UV light. Deletion analysis has allowed us to narrow down on a 20 amino acid stretch at the C-terminal region of MRJ(S) as a potential stress sensing region. Functional studies indicated that constitutive nuclear localization of MRJ(S) promoted attributes of malignancy such as proliferation and invasiveness overall indicating distinct phenotypic characteristics of nuclear MRJ(S).

Abstract: In solid tumors the hypoxic environment can promote tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Recently, acetylsalicylic acid a major component of analgesic drugs and its metabolite salicylic acid (SA) have been shown to reduce the risk of colon cancer, but the mechanisms of action remain still unclear. Here we elucidate the effects of physiologically relevant concentrations of SA on colon carcinoma cells (CaCo-2) grown under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Western blotting, caspase-3/7 apoptosis assays, MTS cell-proliferation assays, LDH cytotoxicity assays and hydrogen peroxide measurements were performed to investigate the effects of 1 and 10μM SA on CaCo-2 cells grown under normoxic conditions and cells exposed to hypoxia. Under normoxic conditions, SA did not influence cell proliferation or LDH release of CaCo-2 cells. However, caspase-3/7 activity was significantly increased. Under hypoxia, cell proliferation was reduced and LDH release and caspase-3/7 activities were increased. None of these parameters was altered by the addition of SA under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia increased hydrogen peroxide concentrations 300-fold and SA significantly augmented the release of hydrogen peroxide under normoxic, but not under hypoxic conditions. Phosphorylation of the pro-survival kinases akt and erk1/2 was not changed by SA under hypoxic conditions, whereas under normoxia SA reduced phosphorylation of erk1/2 after 2 hours. We conclude that in colon carcinoma cells effects of SA on apoptosis and cellular signaling are dependent on the availability of oxygen.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are considered to be suitable vehicles for cellular therapy in various conditions. The expression of reporter and/or effector protein(s) enabled both the identification of MSCs within the organism and the exploitation in targeted tumor therapies. The aim of this study was to evaluate cellular changes induced by retrovirus-mediated transgene expression in MSCs in vitro. Human Adipose Tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) were transduced to express (i) the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter transgene, (ii) the fusion yeast cytosine deaminase::uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (CDy::UPRT) enzyme along with the expression of dominant positive selection gene NeoR or (iii) the selection marker NeoR alone (MOCK). CDy::UPRT expression resulted in increased proliferation of CDy::UPRT-MSCs versus naïve AT-MSCs, MOCK-MSCs or EGFP-MSCs. Furthermore, CDy::UPRT-MSCs were significantly more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil (5FU), cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and cytosine arabinoside as determined by increased Caspase 3/7 activation and/or decreased relative proliferation. CDy::UPRT-MSCs in direct cocultures with breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 increased tumor cell killing induced by low concentrations of 5FU. Our data demonstrated the changes in proliferation and chemoresistance in engineered MSCs expressing transgene with enzymatic function and suggested the possibilities for further augmentation of targeted MSC-mediated antitumor therapy.

Abstract: Keratinocyte migration plays an important role in cutaneous wound healing by supporting the process of reepithelialisation. During directional migration cells develop a polarised shape with an asymmetric distribution of a variety of signalling molecules in their plasma membrane. Here, we investigated front-to-back differences of the physical properties of the plasma membrane of migrating keratinocyte-like HaCaT cells. Using FRAP and fluorescence lifetime analysis, both under TIR illumination, we demonstrate a reduced viscosity of the plasma membrane in the lamellipodia of migrating HaCaT cells compared with the cell rears. This asymmetry is most likely caused by a reduced cholesterol content of the lamellipodia as demonstrated by filipin staining. siRNA-mediated silencing of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1, which is known to redistribute cholesterol from rafts to non-raft regions, as well as pharmacological inhibition of this transporter with glibenclamide, strongly diminished the viscosity gradient of the plasma membrane. In addition, HaCaT cell migration was inhibited by glibenclamide treatment. These data suggest a preferential role of non-raft cholesterol in the establishment of the asymmetric plasma membrane viscosity.

Abstract: High altitude sickness (HAS) occurs among humans visiting or inhabiting high altitude environments. Genetic differences in the EPAS1 and EGLN1 genes have been found between lowland (Han) and highland (Tibetan) Chinese. Three SNPs within EPAS1 and EGLN1 were evaluated in Han and Tibetan patients with acute mountain sickness (AMS) and chronic mountain sickness (CMS). We compared 85 patients with AMS to 79 Han unaffected with mountain sickness (MS) as well as 45 CMS patients to 34 unaffected Tibetan subjects. The three SNPs studied were EPAS1 [ch2: 46441523 (hg18], EGLN1 (rs480902) and (rs516651). Direct sequencing was used to identify individual genotypes for the three SNPs. Age was found to be significantly associated with the EPAS1 SNP in the CMS patients while heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation level of hemoglobin (SaO2) were found to be significantly associated with the EGLN1 (rs480902) SNP in the Han patients with AMS. The individuals with CMS were found to diverge significantly for the EPAS1 SNP compared to their Tibetan control group as measured by genetic distance (0.123) indicating positive selection of the EPAS-G allele with age and illness. The EGLN1 (rs480902) SNP had a significant correlation with hematocrit (HCT), HR and SaO2 in AMS patients. AMS and CMS were found to be significantly associated with the EPAS1 and EGLN1 SNPs compared to their Han and Tibetan control groups, respectively, indicating these nucleotide alterations have a physiological effect for the development of high altitude sickness.

Abstract: Non-alcoholic staetohepatitis (NASH) is associated with fat deposition in the liver favoring inflammatory processes and development of fibrosis, cirrhosis and finally hepatocellular cancer. In Western lifestyle countries, NASH has reached a 20% prevalence in the obese population with escalating tendency in the future. Very often, liver transplantation is the only therapeutic option. Recently, transplantation of hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells was suggested a feasible alternative to whole organ transplantation to ameliorate donor organ shortage. Hence, in the present work an animal model of NASH was established in immunodeficient mice to investigate the feasibility of human stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cell transplantation. NASH was induced by feeding a methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD-diet) for up to 5weeks. Animals developed a fatty liver featuring fibrosis and elevation of the proinflammatory markers serum amyloid A (SAA) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Hepatic triglycerides were significantly increased as well as alanine aminotransferase demonstrating inflammation-linked hepatocyte damage. Elevation of αSMA mRNA and collagen I as well as liver architecture deterioation indicated massive fibrosis. Both short- and long-term post-transplantation human hepatocyte-like cells resided in the mouse host liver indicating parenchymal penetration and most likely functional engraftment. Hence, the NASH model in the immunodeficient mouse is the first to allow for the assessment of the therapeutic impact of human stem cell-derived hepatocyte transplantation.

Abstract: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an outer-membrane glycolipid component of Gram-negative bacteria known for its fervent ability to activate monocytic cells and for its potent proinflammatory capabilities. Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) is a survival protein that has been shown to be stimulated during cell response to stressful conditions, such as exposure to high temperature, heavy metals, proteasome inhibition, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection. In addition, BAG3 regulates replication of Varicella–Zoster Virus (VZV) and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) replication, suggesting that BAG3 could participate in the host response to infection. In the current study, we found that LPS increased the expression of BAG3 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Actinomycin D completely blocked the LPS-induced BAG3 accumulation, as well as LPS activated the proximal promoter of BAG3 gene, supported that the induction by LPS occurred at the level of gene transcription. LPS-induced BAG3 expression was blocked by JNK or NF-κB inhibition, suggesting that JNK and NF-κB pathways participated in BAG3 induction by LPS. In addition, we also found that induction of BAG3 was implicated in monocytic cell adhesion to extracellular matrix induced by LPS. Overall, the data support that BAG3 is induced by LPS via JNK and NF-κB-dependent signals, and involved in monocytic cell-extracellular matrix interaction, suggesting that BAG3 may have a role in the host response to LPS stimulation.

Abstract: Exocytosis is a highly regulated, multistage process consisting of multiple functionally definable stages, including recruitment, targeting, tethering, priming, and docking of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane, followed by calcium-triggered membrane fusion. The acrosome reaction of spermatozoa is a complex, calcium-dependent regulated exocytosis. Fusion at multiple sites between the outer acrosomal membrane and the cell membrane causes the release of the acrosomal contents and the loss of the membranes surrounding the acrosome. Not much is known about the molecules that mediate membrane docking in this particular fusion model. In neurons, the formation of the ternary RIM/Munc13/Rab3A complex has been suggested as a critical component of synaptic vesicles docking. Previously, we demonstrated that Rab3A localizes to the acrosomal region in human sperm, stimulates acrosomal exocytosis, and participates in an early stage during membrane fusion. Here, we report that RIM and Munc13 are also present in human sperm and localize to the acrosomal region. Like Rab3A, RIM and Munc13 participate in a prefusion step before the efflux of intra-acrosomal calcium. By means of a functional assay using antibodies and recombinant proteins, we show that RIM, Munc13 and Rab3A interplay during acrosomal exocytosis. Finally, we report by electron transmission microscopy that sequestering RIM and Rab3A alters the docking of the acrosomal membrane to the plasma membrane during calcium-activated acrosomal exocytosis. Our results suggest that the RIM/Munc13/Rab3 A complex participates in acrosomal exocytosis and that RIM and Rab3A have central roles in membrane docking.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis promotes its replication by inhibiting the apoptosis of infected macrophages. A proapoptotic M. tuberculosis mutant lacking nuoG, a subunit of the type I NADH dehydrogenase complex, exhibits attenuated growth in vivo, indicating that this virulence mechanism is essential. We show that M. tuberculosis also suppresses neutrophil apoptosis. Compared to wild-type, the nuoG mutant spread to a larger number of lung phagocytic cells. Consistent with the shorter lifespan of infected neutrophils, infection with the nuoG mutant resulted in fewer bacteria per infected neutrophil, accelerated bacterial acquisition by dendritic cells, earlier trafficking of these dendritic cells to lymph nodes, and faster CD4 T cell priming. Neutrophil depletion abrogated accelerated CD4 T cell priming by the nuoG mutant, suggesting that inhibiting neutrophil apoptosis delays adaptive immunity in tuberculosis. Thus, pathogen modulation of apoptosis is beneficial at multiple levels, and enhancing phagocyte apoptosis promotes CD4 as well as CD8 T cell responses.

Abstract: Background
Functional activation of oncogenic K-Ras signaling pathway plays an important role in the early events of colorectal carcinogenesis (CRC). K-Ras proto-oncogene is involved in 35–40% of CRC cases. Mutations in the Ras gene trigger the transduction of proliferative and anti-apoptotic signals, even in the absence of extra cellular stimuli. The objective of the current study was to use a gene-targeting approach to kill human CRC cells selectively harboring mutated K-Ras.
Results
A recombinant adenovirus that carries a lethal gene, PUMA, under the control of a Ras responsive promoter (Ad-Py4-SV40-PUMA) was used selectively to target CRC cells (HCT116, SW480, DLD1 and RIE-Ras) that possess a hyperactive Ras pathway while using HT29 and RIE cells as a control that harbors wild type Ras and exhibit very low Ras activity. Control vector, without the Ras responsive promoter elements was used to assess the specificity of our “gene therapy” approach. Both adenoviral vectors were assed in vitro and in xenograft model in vivo. Ad-Py4-SV40-PUMA showed high potency to induce ~50% apoptosis in vitro, to abolish completely tumor formation by infecting cells with the Ad-Py4-SV40-PUMA prior xenografting them in nude mice and high ability to suppress by ~35% tumor progression in vivo in already established tumors.
Conclusions
Selective targeting of CRC cells with the activated Ras pathway may be a novel and effective therapy in CRC. The high potency of this adenoviral vector may help to overcome an undetectable micro metastasis that is the major hurdle in challenging with CRC.

Abstract: Although angiogenesis is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis, the molecular mechanisms controlling this process are not clearly understood. Here, we explore the role of Dab2 in tumor angiogenesis. We found that Dab2 is expressed in several cancer cells, including A549 lung cancer cells, but it is hardly detectable in SW480 colon cancer cells. Migration and Erk phosphorylation were enhanced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with the conditioned medium obtained from Dab2-overexpressing SW480 stable cells. In addition, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein was strongly detected in conditioned medium derived from Dab2-overexpressing SW480 cells, and Erk phosphorylation enhanced by Dab2(+) CM was restored by VEGF inhibition. Moreover, Dab2 depletion in A549 cells led to a decrease in HUVEC migration and Erk phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that Dab2 is required for the TGFβ-induced gene expression of angiogenic factors such as VEGF and FGF2. Taken together, these results suggest that Dab2, which is expressed in cancer cells, is pivotal for endothelial cell migration by affecting VEGF expression.

Abstract: Cells resembling bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been isolated from many organs but their functional relationships have not been thoroughly examined. Here we compared the immunophenotype, gene expression, multipotency and immunosuppressive potential of MSC-like colony-forming cells from adult murine bone marrow (bmMSC), kidney (kCFU-F) and heart (cCFU-F), cultured under uniform conditions. All populations showed classic MSC morphology and in vitro mesodermal multipotency. Of the two solid organ-specific CFU-F, only kCFU-F displayed suppression of T-cell alloreactivity in vitro, albeit to a lesser extent than bmMSC. Quantitative immunophenotyping using 81 phycoerythrin-conjugated CD antibodies demonstrated that all populations contained high percentages of cells expressing diagnostic MSC surface markers (Sca1, CD90.2, CD29, CD44), as well as others noted previously on murine MSC (CD24, CD49e, CD51, CD80, CD81, CD105). Illumina microarray expression profiling and bioinformatic analysis indicated a correlation of gene expression of 0.88–0.92 between pairwise comparisons. All populations expressed approximately 66% of genes in the pluripotency network (Plurinet), presumably reflecting their stem-like character. Furthermore, all populations expressed genes involved in immunomodulation, homing and tissue repair, suggesting these as conserved functions for MSC-like cells in solid organs. Despite this molecular congruence, strong biases in gene and protein expression and pathway activity were seen, suggesting organ-specific functions. Hence, tissue-derived MSC may also retain unique properties potentially rendering them more appropriate as cellular therapeutic agents for their organ of origin.

Abstract: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is an RNA-binding protein that modulates splice site usage, polyadenylation, and cleavage efficiency. This protein has also been implicated in mRNA stability and transport from the nucleus. We have previously demonstrated that hnRNP A1 had diminished protein levels and showed cytoplasmic accumulation in senescent human diploid fibroblasts. Furthermore, we have shown that inhibition of p38 MAPK, a key regulator of cellular senescence, elevated hnRNP A1 protein levels and inhibited hnRNP A1 cytoplasmic localization. In this study, we have explored the possible involvement of MNK1, one of the downstream effector of p38 MAPK, in the regulation of hnRNP A1. We have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of MNK1 by CGP 57380 decreased the phosphorylation levels of hnRNP A1 in young and senescent fibroblast cells and blocked the cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1 in senescent cells. In addition, MNK1 formed a complex with hnRNP A1 in vivo. The expression levels of MNK1, phospho-MNK1, and phospho-eIF4E proteins were found to be elevated in senescent cells. These data suggest that MNK1 regulates the phosphorylation and the subcellular distribution of hnRNP A1 and that MNK1 may play a role in the induction of senescence.

Stable expression of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase in cultured preadipocytes impairs adipogenesis program independently of endogenous prostanoids,

Abstract: Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) expressed preferentially in adipocytes is responsible for the synthesis of PGD2 and its non-enzymatic dehydration products, PGJ2 series, serving as pro-adipogenic factors. However, the role of L-PGDS in the regulation of adipogenesis is complex because of the occurrence of several derivatives from PGD2 and their distinct receptor subtypes as well as other functions such as a transporter of lipophilic molecules. To manipulate the expression levels of L-PGDS in cultured adipocytes, cultured preadipogenic 3T3-L1 cells were transfected stably with a mammalian expression vector having cDNA encoding murine L-PGDS oriented in the sense direction. The isolated cloned stable transfectants with L-PGDS expressed higher levels of the transcript and protein levels of L-PGDS, and synthesized PGD2 from exogenous arachidonic acid at significantly higher levels. By contrast, the synthesis of PGE2 remained unchanged, indicating no influence on the reactions of cyclooxygenase (COX) and PGE synthase. Furthermore, the ability of those transfectants to synthesize Δ12-PGJ2 increased more greatly during the maturation phase. The sustained expression of L-PGDS in cultured stable transfectants hampered the storage of fats during the maturation phase of adipocytes, which was accompanied by the reduced gene expression of adipocyte-specific markers reflecting the down-regulation of the adipogenesis program. The suppressed adipogenesis was not rescued by either exogenous aspirin or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists including troglitazone and Δ12-PGJ2. Taken together, the results indicate the negative regulation of the adipogenesis program by the enhanced expression of L-PGDS through a cellular mechanism involving the interference of the PPARγ signaling pathway without the contribution of endogenous pro-adipogenic prostanoids.

Abstract: Summary
Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which are the leading cause of both acute and chronic urinary tract infections, often secrete a labile pore-forming toxin known as α-hemolysin (HlyA). We show that stable insertion of HlyA into epithelial cell and macrophage membranes triggers degradation of the cytoskeletal scaffolding protein paxillin and other host regulatory proteins, as well as components of the proinflammatory NFκB signaling cascade. Proteolysis of these factors requires host serine proteases, and paxillin degradation specifically involves the serine protease mesotrypsin. The induced activation of mesotrypsin by HlyA is preceded by redistribution of mesotrypsin precursors from the cytosol into foci along microtubules and within nuclei. HlyA intoxication also stimulated caspase activation, which occurred independently of effects on host serine proteases. HlyA-induced proteolysis of host proteins likely allows UPEC to not only modulate epithelial cell functions, but also disable macrophages and suppress inflammatory responses.

Abstract: The cytoskeleton is crucial in determining cell architecture, division, motility, transport processes and in local control of signal transduction. Relatives of actin and tubulin are expressed in all phyla, underlining the fundamental importance of conserved cytoskeletal functions. Intermediate filament proteins have evolved in parallel with tissue diversity in the animal kingdom, likely from the demand to adapt one class of cytoskeletal proteins to cell type-restricted functions. Up to now, the evolutionary origin of cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins remains unknown. Using a known gene encoding a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein from the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii, we have identified the first corresponding gene in the sea anemone Nematostella, tentatively named cytovec. Our data reveal a relationship of cytovec with Hydra vulgaris nematocilins A and B that also lack a CAAX box. In light of additional recent findings, our data show that cytoplasmic intermediate filament genes are present in the common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria.

Abstract: Despite evidence of considerable iron overload in transfusion-independent patients with β-thalassemia intermedia, data on hepatic outcomes remain scarce. We analyzed data from a cohort of 42 β-thalassemia intermedia adults followed for four years (median age 38years), and evaluated the association between longitudinal changes in serum ferritin levels and transient elastography values, a measure of hepatic stiffness predictive of fibrosis. We observed a significant increase in both serum ferritin levels (+81.2 [μg/l]/year) and transient elastography values in non-chelated patients (n=28) (+0.3kPa/year), with two patients worsening their fibrosis stage. Chelated patients (n=14) had a significant decrease in both measures (−42.0 [μg/l]/year and −0.9kPa/year, respectively), with two patients improving their fibrosis stage. There was a strong correlation between the rate of change in serum ferritin level and the rate of change in transient elastography value (R2: 0.836, p<0.001) noted in both non-chelated and chelated patients. An association between iron overload status and hepatic disease merits further evaluation in this subset of transfusion-independent patients.

Abstract: Diagnostic cytogenetic and molecular analysis is recognized as the most valuable prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Among 2516 consecutive Chinese patients with de novo AML, 2308 patients had successful cytogenetic results including 61 subclasses of cytogenetic abnormalities and 27 kinds of additional cytogenetic abnormalities. The incidence of t(15;17)(q22;q12) was highest (16.7% of 2308 patients), followed by t(8;21)(q22;q22) (15.1%), trisomy 8 (5.5%), loss of Y (4.5%), trisomy 21 (2.4%), inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q22) (2.1%), etc. In comparison to children, adults had higher incidence of normal karyotype (41.5% vs. 29.1%, P<0.001) and lower incidences of t(8;21)(q22;q22) (13.4% vs. 25.8%, P<0.001), t(9;11)(p22;q23) (0.2% vs. 1.2%, P=0.001) and other 11q23 rearrangements (1.0% vs. 3.4%, P<0.001). Among 349 AML patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22), 310 (35.5%) were found in 873 patients with M2. The t(15;17)(q22;q12) was exclusively observed in 386 (71.0%) of 544 patients with M3. In 48 AML patients with inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13;q22), 42 (15.2%) were detected in 276 patients with M4. Our study displayed the cytogenetic characteristics in a large series of Chinese patients with de novo AML. Our results revealed the similarities and differences of cytogenetic abnormalities existing between Chinese and western AML patients.

Abstract: Summary
Salmonella virulence effectors elicit host cell membrane ruffling to facilitate pathogen invasion. The WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) governs the underlying membrane-localized actin polymerization, but how Salmonella manipulates WRC is unknown. We show that Rho GTPase activation by the Salmonella guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SopE efficiently triggered WRC recruitment but not its activation, which required host Arf GTPase activity. Invading Salmonella recruited and activated Arf1 to facilitate ruffling and uptake. Arf3 and Arf6 could also enhance invasion. RNAi screening of host Arf-family GEFs revealed a key role for ARNO in pathogen invasion and generation of pathogen-containing macropinosomes enriched in Arf1 and WRC. Salmonella recruited ARNO via Arf6 and the phosphoinositide phosphatase effector SopB-induced PIP3 generation. ARNO in turn triggered WRC recruitment and activation, which was dramatically enhanced when SopE and ARNO cooperated. Thus, we uncover a mechanism by which pathogen and host GEFs synergize to regulate WRC and trigger Salmonella invasion.

Abstract: During the progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the induction of an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) program may play a critical role in the dissemination of cells from the primary tumor to distant metastatic foci. The process of EMT involves the activation of several important genes and pathways to help maintain survival and growth and evolve into highly invasive and metastatic variants. In this study, expression microarray analysis identified a set of 145 upregulated genes in EMT-like HNSCC cells. Some of the strongly upregulated transcripts include genes that are reportedly involved in invasion and metastasis, such as DOCK10, LOX, ROBO1 and SRGN. Importantly, the Tbx3 gene, a member of the T-box transcription factor, was strongly upregulated in SCC cells displaying an EMT-like phenotype compared to cells with an epitheloid, non-EMT behavior. Tbx3 was also found to be strongly upregulated at the protein and gene expression level in an experimental model of snail-induced EMT cells. In addition, siRNA-induced Tbx3 depletion modestly suppressed cell invasion while enhancing Tbx3-mediated resistance to anoikis. Our findings provide evidence that Tbx3 overexpression promotes SCC cell survival displaying an EMT phenotype. This set of newly identified genes that are modulated during EMT-like conversion may be important diagnostic biomarkers during the process of HNSCC progression.

Abstract: The forkhead transcription factor FoxA1 participates in many gene regulatory events with steroid hormone receptors, one example being the integrated mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. Its enhancer harbors several FoxA1 binding sites. FoxA1 promotes glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-DNA binding and transcription. Here we analyze the regulatory capacity of GR, FoxA1 and hormone in quantitative terms when reconstituted with the MMTV enhancer in Xenopus oocytes. By titrating each component we demonstrate that FoxA1 is required for hormone induction at low GR concentration and that FoxA1 is a potent enhancer of GR-induced transcription. Conversely, specific DNA binding of FoxA1 at low intranuclear concentration is highly responsive to minute levels of hormone-activated GR while increased FoxA1 concentration results in constitutive binding. When bound to DNA, FoxA1 induces DNase I hypersensitivity, this is accompanied by increased acetylation, specifically at histone H4K16. Expression of FoxA1 deletion mutants demonstrated its DNA binding domain to be sufficient for DNA binding in vivo. The C-terminal and N-terminal domains both contribute to chromatin remodeling while the latter is more important for GR mediated transcription. Thus FoxA1 is primarily responsible for the chromatin presetting while GR supports chromatin presetting at low hormone concentration and transcriptional induction at high hormone concentration.

Abstract: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) plays an important role in the regulation of tooth root development, and stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs) are responsible for the formation of root pulp and dentin. To date, it remains unclear whether IGF-1 can regulate the function of SCAPs. In this study, SCAPs were isolated and purified from human immature root apex, and stimulated by 100ng/mL exogenous IGF-1. The effects of IGF-1 on the proliferation and differentiation of SCAPs were subsequently investigated. IGF-1 treated SCAPs presented the morphological and ultrastructural changes. Cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization capacity of SCAPs were increased by IGF-1. Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses further demonstrated that the expression of osteogenic-related proteins and genes (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, runt-related transcription factor 2, osterix, and osteocalcin) was significantly up-regulated in IGF-1 treated SCAPs, whereas the expression of odontoblast-specific markers (e.g., dentin sialoprotein and dentin sialophosphoprotein) was down-regulated by IGF-1. In vivo results revealed that IGF-1 treated SCAPs mostly gave birth to bone-like tissues while untreated SCAPs mainly generated dentin-pulp complex-like structures after transplantation. The present study revealed that IGF-1 can promote the osteogenic differentiation and osteogenesis capacity of SCAPs, but weaken their odontogenic differentiation and dentinogenesis capability, indicating that IGF-1 treated SCAPs can be used as a potential candidate for bone tissue engineering.

Abstract: The anterior ocular surface comprises the cornea, conjunctiva and a narrow intermediate region called the limbus. It is widely accepted that the corneal epithelium is maintained by stem cells but different hypotheses propose that the stem cells that maintain the mouse corneal epithelium during normal homeostasis are located either in the basal limbal epithelium or throughout the basal corneal epithelium. There are no specific markers to help test these alternatives and new methods are required to distinguish between them. We observed that KRT5LacZ/− transgenic mice produced rare β-galactosidase (β-gal)-positive radial stripes in the corneal epithelium. These stripes are likely to be clonal lineages of cells derived from stem cells, so they provide a lineage marker for actively proliferating stem cells. The distributions of the β-gal-positive radial stripes suggested they extended centripetally from the limbus, supporting the limbal epithelial stem cell (LESC) hypothesis. Stripe frequency declined between 15 and 30weeks, which predicts a reduction in stem cell function with age.

Abstract: B-cell receptor (BCR) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation and integration with signals from the pathogen or immune cells and their products determine the B-cell antibody response. Low expression of BCR is the hallmark of B lymphocytes in CLL, however little is known about the expression and function of TLR in B-CLL. We studied TLR2, TLR4, IL-6 and mIL-6Rα expression on mRNA and protein level in CD19+ subpopulation of normal lymphocytes and the CD19+CD5+ subpopulation from B-CLL. Experiments were performed on unstimulated and stimulated lymphocytes [Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli — TLR2- and TLR4-specific agonists, respectively]. We showed undetectable or low IL-6 expression, which seems to be specific for B-CLL lymphocytes. Induction of TLR4 mRNA upon LPS stimulation affected the expression of IL-6, but not of mIL-6Rα. Increased expression of TLR2 (MFI) after LPS and SAC stimulation did not correlate with mIL-6Rα receptor expression. B-CLL CD19+CD5+ lymphocytes showed a significant increase in TLR2 expression at the protein level after stimulation with SAC and LPS compared to normal CD19+ lymphocytes. TLR2 may influence the behaviour of the malignant clone in B-CLL.

Abstract: The main physiological function of adipose-derived stromal/progenitor cells (ASC) is to differentiate into adipocytes. ASC are most likely localized at perivascular sites in adipose tissues and retain the capacity to differentiate into multiple cell types. Although cell surface markers for ASC have been described, there is no complete consensus on the antigen expression pattern that will precisely define these cells. DLK1(PREF1) is an established marker for mouse adipocyte progenitors which inhibits adipogenesis. This suggests that DLK1(PREF1) could be a useful marker to characterize human ASC. The DLK1(PREF1) status of human ASC is however unknown. In the present study we isolated ASC from the heterogeneous stromal vascular fraction of subcutaneous abdominal fat pats of adult women. These cells were selected by their plastic adherence and expanded to passage 5. The ASC were characterized as relatively homogenous cell population with the capacity to differentiate in vitro into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts and the immunophenotype CD105+/CD90+/CD34+/CD31−/FABP4−. The ASC were positive for DLK1(PREF1) which was well expressed in proliferating and density arrested cells but downregulated in the course of adipogenic differentiation. To investigate whether DLK1(PREF1) plays a role in the regulation of adipogenesis in these cells RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments were conducted. Knockdown of DLK1(PREF1) in differentiating ASC resulted in a significant increase of the expression of the adipogenic key regulator PPARγ2 and of the terminal adipogenic differentiation marker FABP4. We conclude that DLK1(PREF1) is well expressed in human ASC and acts as a negative regulator of adipogenesis. Moreover, DLK1(PREF1) could be a functional marker contributing to the characterization of human ASC.

Abstract: Limitations to the in vivo study of human nervous system development make it necessary to design an in vitro model to evaluate the in vivo effects of surrounding tissues on neurogenesis and regional identity of the human neural plate. Rostral neural progenitors (NPs) were initially generated from adherent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in a defined condition and characterized. Then, to find the role of somites (S) and notochords (N) in rostro-caudal (RC) and dorso-ventral (DV) patterning of neuronal cells, NPs were co-cultured with microencapsulated chicken S or N in alginate beads. In this study, N induced more neurogenesis as evaluated by expression of TUJ1 and MAP2-positive cells. Additionally, N induced spinal cord ventral brachiothoracic identity as well as NPs proliferation. We observed a synergic effect on motoneuron induction when S and N were used together. Moreover, S induced hindbrain identity in differentiated neuronal cells from NPs. These results indicate that highly enriched NPs can be generated in an adherent and defined system from hESCs. Moreover, S and N tissues highly influenced neuronal differentiation in point of proliferation, neurogenesis, and RC and DV regional identity. These results indicate a very simple and efficient protocol to mimic in vivo events of human neural development in vitro which is important in the context of developmental neuroscience and cellular replacement therapies.

Abstract: Recent studies have identified caveolin-1, a protein best known for its functions in caveolae, in apical endocytic recycling compartments in polarized epithelial cells. However, very little is known about the regulation of caveolin-1 in the endocytic recycling pathway. To address this question, in the current study we compared the relationship between compartments enriched in sub-apical caveolin-1 and Rab11a, a well-defined marker of apical recycling endosomes, using polarized MDCK cells as a model. We show that caveolin-1-containing vesicles define a compartment that partially overlaps with Rab11a, and that the distribution of subapical caveolin-1 and Rab11a shows a similar dependence on microtubule disruption. Mutants of the Rab11a effector, Rab11-FIP2 also altered the localization of caveolin-1. These findings indicate that caveolin-1 is coordinately regulated with Rab11a within the apical recycling system of polarized epithelial cells, suggesting that the two proteins are components of the same pathway.

Abstract: Satellite cells are the major pool of muscle stem cells after birth; they represent an important component required to maintain muscle mass and functionality during life. The molecular mechanisms involved in myogenic differentiation are relatively well-known. However, the role of extracellular stimulus in the control of differentiation remains largely unresolved. Notably little is known about the impact of nutrients on this process. Here we have studied the role of leucine, an essential amino acid, in the control of myogenic differentiation. Leucine is a well-known regulator of muscle protein synthesis. It acts not only as a substrate for translation but also as a regulator of gene expression and signaling pathways such as those involving mTOR and GCN2. In this study we demonstrated that the lack of leucine abolishes the differentiation of both C2C12 myoblasts and primary satellite cells. This effect is associated with a modification of the pattern of expression of the myogenic regulatory factors (MRF) myf5 and myoD. We report an up-regulation of myf5 mRNA and a decrease of myoD protein level during leucine starvation. This study demonstrates the importance of a nutrient, leucine, in the control of the myogenic differentiation program.

Abstract: The most important entity of the selective behavior of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is considered to be the matter called “barrier,” “meshwork” or “sieve.” This part of NPC has not been well elucidated by using electron microscopy methods to date. In the present study, we demonstrated the presence of a coherent transversal barrier in the central channel of NPC, using high resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the barrier is located in the middle of the central channel, i.e. at the level where the outer and inner nuclear membranes fuse. The thickness of this layer is evidently different in various NPCs and usually varies between 20 and 30nm and its diameter is approximately 40nm. The cytoplasmic and nuclear surfaces of the barrier are roughly parallel and plane. Moreover we suggest that the barrier may not be interrupted by any channel(s), at least not with a diameter above 10nm. Further various appearances of the central channel with different particles were observed, presumably cargos and karyopherins captured in transit. A different type of central channel barrier with lipid bilayer membrane-like appearance is also discussed.

Abstract: The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is a conserved mechanism that ensures the fidelity of chromosome distribution in mitosis by preventing anaphase onset until the correct bipolar microtubule–kinetochore attachments are formed. Errors in SAC function may contribute to tumorigenesis by inducing numerical chromosome anomalies (aneuploidy). On the other hand, total disruption of SAC can lead to massive genomic imbalance followed by cell death, a phenomena that has therapeutic potency. We performed a cell-based high-throughput screen with a compound library of 2000 bioactives for novel SAC inhibitors and discovered a plant-derived phenolic compound eupatorin (3′,5-dihydroxy-4′,6,7-trimethoxyflavone) as an anti-mitotic flavonoid. The premature override of the microtubule drug-imposed mitotic arrest by eupatorin is dependent on microtubule–kinetochore attachments but not interkinetochore tension. Aurora B kinase activity, which is essential for maintenance of normal SAC signaling, is diminished by eupatorin in cells and in vitro providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed forced mitotic exit. Eupatorin likely has additional targets since eupatorin treatment of pre-mitotic cells causes spindle anomalies triggering a transient M phase delay followed by impaired cytokinesis and polyploidy. Finally, eupatorin potently induces apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines and suppresses cancer cell proliferation in organotypic 3D cell culture model.

Abstract: Cardiotoxicity is the major dose-limiting adverse effect of anthracyclines and is hypothesized to result from damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) or inhibition of topoisomerase II. Here, we comparatively analyzed the effect of doxorubicin and the organic peroxide tertiary-butylhydroperoxide (tBOOH) on stress responses of rat cardiomyblast cells (H9c2). Moreover, we investigated the impact of serum factors and the novel prototypical protein kinase CK2 inhibitor resorufin on the sensentivity of H9c2 cells exposed to doxorubicin or tBOOH. Measuring cell viability by use of the WST assay as well as cell cycle progression and apoptotic death by FACS-based methods, we found that the sensitivity of H9c2 cells to doxorubicin and tBOOH was differently affected by both serum factors and resorufin. Formation of reactive oxygen species was observed after exposure of H9c2 cells to high doses (i.e. ≥5μM) of doxorubicin only. Moreover, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine protected H9c2 cells from cytotoxicity provoked by tBOOH but not doxorubicin. Analyzing the phosphorylation level of genotoxic stress responsive protein kinases and histone H2AX, which is indicative of an activated DNA damage response (DDR), we found that resorufin modulates doxorubicin- and tBOOH-induced responses in an agent specific manner. Taken together, the data indicate that (i) oxidative injury is not the most relevant type of damage triggering cell death of H9c2 cells following doxorubicin treatment, (ii) serum factors differently influence the sensitivity of cardiomyoblasts to doxorubicin and tBOOH and (iii) inhibition of CK2 unequally affects doxorubicin- and tBOOH-induced DDR of rat cardiomyoblasts.

Abstract: 12(S)-Lipoxygenase (LOX) and its product 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenic (HETE) acid have been implicated in angiogenesis and tumour invasion in several tumour types while their role in colorectal cancer progression has not yet been studied. We have analysed 12(S)-LOX expression in colorectal tumours and found gene expression up-regulated in colorectal cancer specimens for which the pathology report described involvement of inflammation. Using cell line models exposed to 12(S)-HETE or over-expressing 12(S)-LOX malignant cell growth as well as tumour cell migration was found to be stimulated. Specifically, Caco2 and SW480 cells over-expressing 12(S)-LOX formed fewer colonies from sparse cultures, but migrated better in filter-migration assays. SW480 LOX cells also had higher anchorage-independent growth capacity and a higher tendency to metastasise in vivo. Knock-down or inhibition of 12(S)-LOX inhibited cell migration and anchorage-independent growth in both 12(S)-LOX transfectants and SW620 cells that express high endogenous levels of 12(S)-LOX. On the cell surface E-cadherin and integrin-β1 expression were down-regulated in a 12(S)-LOX-dependent manner disturbing cell–cell interactions. The results demonstrate that 12(S)-LOX expression in inflammatory areas of colorectal tumours has the capacity to induce an invasive phenotype in colorectal cancer cells and could be targeted for therapy.

Abstract: Mal3 is a fission yeast homolog of EB1, a plus-end tracking protein (+TIP). We have generated a mutation (89R) replacing glutamine with arginine in the calponin homology (CH) domain of Mal3. Analysis of the 89R mutant in vitro has revealed that the mutation confers a higher affinity to microtubules and enhances the intrinsic activity to promote the microtubule-assembly. The mutant Mal3 is no longer a +TIP, but binds strongly the microtubule lattice. Live cell imaging has revealed that while the wild type Mal3 proteins dissociate from the tip of the growing microtubules before the onset of shrinkage, the mutant Mal3 proteins persist on microtubules and reduces a rate of shrinkage after a longer pausing period. Consequently, the mutant Mal3 proteins cause abnormal elongation of microtubules composing the spindle and aster. Mal3 is phosphorylated at a cluster of serine/threonine residues in the linker connecting the CH and EB1-like C-terminal motif domains. The phosphorylation occurs in a microtubule-dependent manner and reduces the affinity of Mal3 to microtubules. We propose that because the 89R mutation is resistant to the effect of phosphorylation, it can associate persistently with microtubules and confers a stronger stability of microtubules likely by reinforcing the cylindrical structure.

Abstract: Summary
The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila subverts host membrane transport pathways to promote fusion of vesicles exiting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the pathogen-containing vacuole. During infection there is noncanonical pairing of the SNARE protein Sec22b on ER-derived vesicles with plasma membrane (PM)-localized syntaxin proteins on the vacuole. We show that the L. pneumophila Rab1-targeting effector DrrA is sufficient to stimulate this noncanonical SNARE association and promote membrane fusion. DrrA activation of the Rab1 GTPase on PM-derived organelles stimulated the tethering of ER-derived vesicles with the PM-derived organelle, resulting in vesicle fusion through the pairing of Sec22b with the PM syntaxin proteins. Thus, the effector protein DrrA stimulates a host membrane transport pathway that enables ER-derived vesicles to remodel a PM-derived organelle, suggesting that Rab1 activation at the PM is sufficient to promote the recruitment and fusion of ER-derived vesicles.

Abstract: Copy number variation (CNV) is a common chromosomal alteration that can occur during in vitro cultivation of human cells and can be accompanied by the accumulation of mutations in coding region sequences. We describe here a systematic application of current molecular technologies to provide a detailed understanding of genomic and sequence profiles of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines that were derived under GMP-compliant conditions. We first examined the overall chromosomal integrity using cytogenetic techniques to determine chromosome count, and to detect the presence of cytogenetically aberrant cells in the culture (mosaicism). Assays of copy number variation, using both microarray and sequence-based analyses, provide a detailed view genomic variation in these lines and shows that in early passage cultures of these lines, the size range and distribution of CNVs are entirely consistent with those seen in the genomes of normal individuals. Similarly, genome sequencing shows variation within these lines that is completely within the range seen in normal genomes. Important gene classes, such as tumor suppressors and genetic disease genes, do not display overtly disruptive mutations that could affect the overall safety of cell-based therapeutics. Complete sequence also allows the analysis of important transplantation antigens, such as ABO and HLA types. The combined application of cytogenetic and molecular technologies provides a detailed understanding of genomic and sequence profiles of GMP produced ES lines for potential use as therapeutic agents.

Abstract: Naturally-occurring, endogenous electric fields (EFs) have been detected at skin wounds, damaged tissue sites and vasculature. Applied EFs guide migration of many types of cells, including endothelial cells to migrate directionally. Homing of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to an injury site is important for repair of vasculature and also for angiogenesis. However, it has not been reported whether EPCs respond to applied EFs. Aiming to explore the possibility to use electric stimulation to regulate the progenitor cells and angiogenesis, we tested the effects of direct-current (DC) EFs on EPCs. We first used immunofluorescence to confirm the expression of endothelial progenitor markers in three lines of EPCs. We then cultured the progenitor cells in EFs. Using time–lapse video microscopy, we demonstrated that an applied DC EF directs migration of the EPCs toward the cathode. The progenitor cells also align and elongate in an EF. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor signaling completely abolished the EF-induced directional migration of the progenitor cells. We conclude that EFs are an effective signal that guides EPC migration through VEGF receptor signaling in vitro. Applied EFs may be used to control behaviors of EPCs in tissue engineering, in homing of EPCs to wounds and to an injury site in the vasculature.

Abstract: Ciliates of the genus Euplotes rely on the autocrine (self) and paracrine (non-self) activities of their water-borne protein pheromones to control the two fundamental phenomena of their life cycle, i.e. vegetative (mitotic) growth and sex manifested as cell union in mating pairs. We observed that cell aging determines the synthesis of increasing concentrations of pheromones that are oxidized at the level of methionine residues which are more exposed on the molecular surface. The oxidized form of the E. raikovi pheromone Er-1 was purified and its interactions with its source cells were shown no longer to be of autocrine type directed to promote cell growth, but changed to interactions of the paracrine type directed to induce cell unions in mating pairs of the selfing type (i.e. involving genetically identical cells). These pairs generate viable offspring, like pairs formed between genetically different cells. It was therefore concluded that aging cells may paradoxically gain beneficial effects from the synthesis of oxidized forms of their pheromones. By undergoing mating in response to the interactions with these forms, they can re-initiate a new life cycle and, in fact, rejuvenate.

Abstract: Background
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, affecting more than 500 million people worldwide, is one of the most common of inherited disorders. There are 186 G6PD mutations published, with mutational clustering within defined ethnic/racial groups. However comprehensive molecular characterization of ethnically associated G6PD mutants and their clinical implications are lacking.
Design and methods
Eighty unrelated Palestinian children hospitalized for hemolysis were studied. G6PD activity was determined by quantitative spectrophotometry and G6PD mutations were analyzed by sequencing of gDNA.
Results
65 of 80 children (81%) had G6PD deficiency, accounting for most of the hemolytic disease in this age group. G6PD Mediterraneanc.563T, African G6PD A-c.202A/c.376G, and G6PD Cairoc.404C were common with relative allele frequencies of 0.33 [1], 0.26, and 0.18 respectively. Two other variants were discovered, G6PD Beverly Hillsc.1160A mutation, and a novel G6PD missense mutation c.536G>A (Ser179Asn), designated G6PD “Gaza”. Three samples exhibited enzyme deficiency without detectable exonic or exon/intron boundary mutations.
Conclusion
G6PD deficiency accounts for the majority of diagnoses for hemolysis in Palestinian children (81%), providing support for newborn G6PD deficiency screening programs. We report unanticipated molecular heterogeneity of G6PD variants among Gaza Strip Palestinians greater than reported in neighboring Arab populations. We report a high proportion of affected children with G6PD Cairo, which was observed previously in only a single Egyptian, and a novel mutation G6PD “Gaza”.

Abstract: Two full-length cDNAs of heat shock protein (HSP) genes (Se-hsp90 and Se-hsp70) were cloned from the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, and their expression was investigated in relation to cold shock, heat shock, and development. The open reading frames of Se-hsp90 and Se-hsp70 are 2,154 and 2,004 bp in length, encoding polypeptides of 717 and 667 amino acids with a molecular mass of 82.6 and 72.5 kDa, respectively. Both genes showed high similarity to their counterparts in other species. Transcriptional expression profiles revealed that both genes were significantly up-regulated under thermal stress. However, the temperature at which expression level became significantly higher than that of controls varied between genes. Intensity of response to temperature was more intense for Se-hsp70 than for Se-hsp90, regardless of temperature or developmental stage. However, intensities of response to temperature of either Se-hsp90 or Se-hsp70 varied with developmental stage. The basal expression of both genes was highest in young larvae and decreased with age. Translational expression of Se-Hsp70 was observed by using Western blot, the expression profiles of Se-Hsp70 protein were in high agreement with those of Se-hsp70 RNA under heat or cold stress in larvae and pupae. However, it does not completely accord with that of Se-hsp70 RNA expression during development without thermal stress. These results indicated that, in addition to heat shock responses, both Se-hsp90 and Se-hsp70 might be involved in development.

Abstract: We describe here the development and characterization of a conditionally inducible mouse model expressing Lifeact-GFP, a peptide that reports the dynamics of filamentous actin. We have used this model to study platelets, megakaryocytes and melanoblasts and we provide evidence that Lifeact-GFP is a useful reporter in these cell types ex vivo. In the case of platelets and megakaryocytes, these cells are not transfectable by traditional methods, so conditional activation of Lifeact allows the study of actin dynamics in these cells live. We studied melanoblasts in native skin explants from embryos, allowing the visualization of live actin dynamics during cytokinesis and migration. Our study revealed that melanoblasts lacking the small GTPase Rac1 show a delay in the formation of new pseudopodia following cytokinesis that accounts for the previously reported cytokinesis delay in these cells. Thus, through use of this mouse model, we were able to gain insights into the actin dynamics of cells that could only previously be studied using fixed specimens or following isolation from their native tissue environment.

Abstract: Hair follicle harbors a rich stem cell pool with mesenchymal lineage differentiation potential. Although previous studies with rodent cells demonstrated that hair follicle sheath and papilla cells possess multi-lineage differentiation potential, human hair follicle derived mesenchymal stem cells (hHF-MSCs) have not been characterized in detail in terms of their multipotency. In addition, it is not clear whether these cells are true stem cells that can differentiate along multiple lineages or whether they represent a collection of progenitor cells with restricted differentiation potential. Here we report that hHF-MSCs are highly proliferative cells that can be maintained in culture for ~45 population doublings before they start to show signs of cellular senescence. Under appropriate culture conditions, hHF-MSCs differentiated along the myogenic, osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, as demonstrated by kinetic gene expression profiling and functional assays. Interestingly, the differentiation potential decreased with time in culture in a lineage-specific manner. Specifically, myogenesis and chondrogenesis showed a moderate decrease over time; osteogenesis was maximum at intermediate passages and adipogenesis was highly sensitive to long-term culture and was diminished at late passages. Finally, hHF-MSCs were clonally multipotent as the majority of hHF-MSCs clones (73%) demonstrated bi- or tri-lineage differentiation potential. These results suggest that hHF-MSCs may present as an alternative source of easily accessible, autologous stem cells for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by molecular abnormalities in the HMBS gene. This gene is transcribed from two promoters to produce ubiquitous and erythroid specific isoforms of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). In the classical form of AIP, both isoforms are deficient, but about 5% of families have the non-erythroid variant in which only the ubiquitous isoform is affected. Only one mutation sited in the housekeeping promoter has been previously reported as causative for this form of AIP. In this study, we identified one small deletion and six nucleotide substitutions within the 5′UTR and the housekeeping promoter of HMBS gene: c.1–440_-427del14bp; c.1–421G>A; c.1–331C>T; c.1–270G>A; c.1–122T>A; c.1–103C>T; c.1–28A>C. Using luciferase reporter assays and quantitative PCR experiments, we characterized the functional role of these seven novel genetic variants demonstrating that all mutations cause a significant loss of transcriptional activity. Our investigations suggest that these nucleotide substitutions may alter critical binding sites for transcriptional factors, which confirms that these regions represent an important molecular target for pathogenesis of non-erythroid form of acute intermittent porphyria.

Abstract: Melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is notoriously resistant to all current modalities of cancer therapy, including to the drug methotrexate. Melanosomal sequestration and cellular exportation of methotrexate have been proposed to be important melanoma-specific mechanisms that contribute to the resistance of melanoma to methotrexate. In addition, other mechanisms of resistance that are present in most epithelial cancer cells are also operative in melanoma. This report elucidates how melanoma orchestrates these mechanisms to become extremely resistant to methotrexate, where both E2F1 and checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), two molecules with dual roles in survival/apoptosis, play prominent roles. The results indicated that MTX induced the depletion of dihydrofolate in melanoma cells, which stimulated the transcriptional activity of E2F1. The elevate expression of dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase, two E2F1-target genes involved in folate metabolism and required for G1 progression, favored dTTP accumulation, which promoted DNA single strand breaks and the subsequent activation of Chk1. Under these conditions, melanoma cells are protected from apoptosis by arresting their cell cycle in S phase. Excess of dTTP could also inhibit E2F1-mediated apoptosis in melanoma cells.

Abstract: Fibroblast feeder cells play an important role in supporting the derivation and long term culture of undifferentiated, pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The feeder cells secrete various growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins into extracellular milieu. However, the roles of the feeder cell-secreted factors are largely unclear. Animal feeder cells and use of animal serum also make current feeder cell culture conditions unsuitable for derivation of clinical grade hESCs. We established xeno-free feeder cell lines using human serum (HS) and studied their function in hESC culture. While human foreskin fibroblast (hFF) feeder cells were clearly hESC supportive, none of the established xeno-free human dermal fibroblast (hDF) feeder cells were able to maintain undifferentiated hESC growth. The two fibroblast types were compared for their ECM protein synthesis, integrin receptor expression profiles and key growth factor secretion. We show that hESC supportive feeder cells produce laminin-511 and express laminin-binding integrins α3ß1, α6ß1 and α7ß1. These results indicate specific laminin isoforms and integrins in maintenance of hESC pluripotency in feeder-dependent cultures. In addition, several genes with a known or possible role for hESC pluripotency were differentially expressed in distinct feeder cells.

Abstract: Currently, human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were generated from patient or disease-specific sources and share the same key properties as embryonic stem cells. This makes them attractive for personalized medicine, drug screens or cellular therapy. Long-term cultivation and maintenance of normal iPS cells in an undifferentiated self-renewing state are a major challenge. Our previous studies have shown that human amniotic epithelial cells (HuAECs) could provide a good source of feeder cells for mouse and human embryonic stem cells, or spermatogonial stem cells, but the mechanism for this is unknown. Here, we examined the effect of endogenous microRNA-145 regulation on Sox2 expression in human iPS cells by HuAECs feeder cells regulation, and in turn on human iPS cells pluripotency. We found that human IPS cells transfected with a microRNA-145 mutant expressed Sox2 at high levels, allowing iPS to maintain a high level of AP activity in long-term culture and form teratomas in SCID mice. Expression of stem cell markers was increased in iPS transfected with the microRNA-145 mutant, compared with iPS was transfected with microRNA-145. Besides, the expression of Drosha proteins of the microRNA-processor complex, required for the generation of precursor pre-miRNA, was significantly increased in human iPS cells cultured on MEF but not on HuAECs. Taken together, these results suggest that endogenous Sox2 expression may be regulated by microRNA-145 in human iPS cells with HuAECs feeder cells, and Sox2 is a crucial component required for maintenance of them in an undifferentiated, proliferative state capable of self-renewal.

Abstract: The master regulatory gene Bmi1 modulates key stem cell properties in neural precursor cells (NPCs), and has been implicated in brain tumorigenesis. We previously identified a population of CD133+ brain tumor cells possessing stem cell properties, known as brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs). Here, we characterize the expression and role of Bmi1 in primary minimally cultured human glioblastoma (GBM) patient isolates in CD133+ and CD133− sorted populations. We find that Bmi1 expression is increased in CD133− cells, and Bmi1 protein and transcript expression are highest during intermediate stages of differentiation as CD133+ BTICs lose their CD133 expression. Furthermore, in vitro stem cell assays and Bmi1 knockdown show that Bmi1 contributes to self-renewal in CD133+ populations, but regulates proliferation and cell fate determination in CD133− populations. Finally, we test if our in vitro stem cell assays and Bmi1 expression in BTIC patient isolates are predictive of clinical outcome for GBM patients. Bmi1 expression profiles show a marked elevation in the proneural GBM subtype, and stem cell frequency as assessed by tumor sphere assays correlates with patient outcome.

Abstract: Hypoxemia in the circulation can lead to venous thrombosis (VT) through tissue factor (TF) activation, but the mechanism of TF activation in hypoxia remains obscure. Ligands released from damaged tissues or cells due to hypoxia are identified by various pattern-recognition receptors (PRR), including Toll-like receptor3 (TLR3). In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of TF activation during acute hypoxia in a rat model. The expression of TLR3 and TF was analyzed by immunoblotting and RT-PCR. The TF activity was evaluated by two-stage chromogenic assay and fibrin deposition was detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of TLR3, TF, and TF activity was increased significantly 6h post acute hypoxia and then decreased gradually. The contribution of TLR3 in TF activation was investigated by poly I:C and TLR3 neutralizing antibody. We also found increased ERK phosphorylation both in acute hypoxia and poly I:C treatment. We further showed that the pre-treatment of TLR3 neutralizing antibody or ERK inhibitor (PD98059) 2h prior to acute hypoxia or poly I:C treatment completely abrogated ERK phosphorylation and TF activation. The pre-treatment of TLR3 neutralizing antibody also inhibited fibrin deposition in lung vasculature. These data indicate that acute hypoxia induced TF activation is mediated through TLR3-ERK1/2 pathway.

Abstract: Controlling the fate of implanted hMSCs is one of the major drawbacks to be overcome to realize tissue engineering strategies. In particular, the effect of the inflammatory environment on hMSCs behaviour is poorly understood. Studying and mimicking the inflammatory process in vitro is a very complex and challenging task that involves multiple variables. This research addressed the questions using in vitro co-cultures of primary derived hMSCs together with human peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs); the latter are key agents in the inflammatory process. This work explored the in vitro phenotypic changes of hMSCs in co-culture direct contact with monocytes and lymphocytes isolated from blood using both basal and osteogenic medium. Our findings indicated that hMSCs maintained their undifferentiated phenotype and pluripotency despite the contact with PBMCs. Moreover, hMSCs demonstrated increased proliferation and were able to differentiate specifically down the osteogenic lineage pathway. Providing significant crucial evidence to support the hypothesis that inflammation and host defence mechanisms could be utilised rather than avoided and combated to provide for the successful therapeutic application of stem cell therapies.

Abstract: Human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells have potential uses for drug discovery and cell therapy, including generation of pancreatic β-cells for diabetes research and treatment. In this study, we developed a simple protocol for generating insulin-producing cells from hiPS cells. Treatment with activin A and a GSK3β inhibitor enhanced efficient endodermal differentiation, and then combined treatment with retinoic acid, a bone morphogenic protein inhibitor, and a transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) inhibitor induced efficient differentiation of pancreatic progenitor cells from definitive endoderm. Expression of the pancreatic progenitor markers PDX1 and NGN3 was significantly increased at this step and most cells were positive for anti-PDX1 antibody. Moreover, several compounds, including forskolin, dexamethasone, and a TGF-β inhibitor, were found to induce the differentiation of insulin-producing cells from pancreatic progenitor cells. By combined treatment with these compounds, more than 10% of the cells became insulin positive. The differentiated cells secreted human c-peptide in response to various insulin secretagogues. In addition, all five hiPS cell lines that we examined showed efficient differentiation into insulin-producing cells with this protocol.

Abstract: Robust expansion and genetic manipulation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are limited by poor cell survival after enzymatic dissociation into single cells. Although inhibition of apoptosis is implicated for the single-cell survival of hESCs, the protective role of attenuation of apoptosis in hESC survival has not been elucidated. Bcl-xL is one of several anti-apoptotic proteins, which are members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Using an inducible system, we ectopically expressed Bcl-xL gene in hESCs, and found a significant increase of hESC colonies in the single-cell suspension cultures. Overexpression of Bcl-xL in hESCs decreased apoptotic caspase-3+ cells, suggesting attenuation of apoptosis in hESCs. Without altering the kinetics of pluripotent gene expression, the efficiency to generate embryoid bodies (EBs) in vitro and the formation of teratoma in vivo were significantly increased in Bcl-xL-overexpressing hESCs after single-cell dissociation. Interestingly, the number and size of hESC colonies from cluster cultures were not affected by Bcl-xL overexpression. Several genes of extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules were upregulated by Bcl-xL in hESCs without single-cell dissociation, suggesting that Bcl-xL regulates adhesion molecular expression independent of cell dissociation. In addition, the gene expressions of FAS and several TNF signaling mediators were downregulated by Bcl-xL. These data support a model in which Bcl-xL promotes cell survival and increases cloning efficiency of dissociated hESCs without altering hESC self-renewal by i) attenuation of apoptosis, and ii) upregulation of adhesion molecules to facilitate cell–cell or cell–matrix interactions.

Abstract: Cardiomyocytes (CMs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are important cell types for cardiac repair post myocardial infarction. Here we proved that both CMs and MSCs can be simultaneously generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) via a pro-mesoderm differentiation strategy. Two hiPSC lines, hiPSC (1) and hiPSC (2) were generated from human dermal fibroblasts using OCT-4, SOX-2, KLF-4, c-Myc via retroviral-based reprogramming. H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) served as control. CMs and MSCs were co-generated from hiPSCs and hESCs via embryoid body-dependent cardiac differentiation protocol involving a serum-free and insulin-depleted medium containing a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB 203580. Comparing to bone marrow and umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs, hiPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) expressed common MSC markers and were capable of adipogenesis, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. Moreover, iMSCs continuously proliferated for more than 32 population doublings without cellular senescence and showed superior pro-angiogenic and wound healing properties. In summary, we generated a large number of homogenous MSCs in conjunction with CMs in a low-cost and efficient one step manner. Functionally competent CMs and MSCs co-generated from hiPSCs may be useful for autologous cardiac repair.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses modulate the actin cytoskeleton at almost every step of their cellular journey from entry to egress. Cellular sensing of these cytoskeletal changes may function in the recognition of viral infection. Here we show that focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a focal adhesion localized tyrosine kinase that transmits signals between the extracellular matrix and the cytoplasm, serves as a RIG-I-like receptor antiviral signaling component by directing mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor (MAVS) activation. Cells deficient in FAK are highly susceptible to RNA virus infection and attenuated in antiviral signaling. We show that FAK interacts with MAVS at the mitochondrial membrane in a virus infection-dependent manner and potentiates MAVS-mediated signaling via a kinase-independent mechanism. A cysteine protease encoded by enteroviruses cleaves FAK to suppress its role in innate immune signaling. These findings suggest that FAK serves as a link between cytoskeletal perturbations that occur during virus infection and activation of innate immune signaling.

Abstract: Fluorescent proteins are widely used for the direct visualization of events such as gene expression and subcellular localization in mammalian cells. It is well established that oxygen is required for formation of functional chromophore; however, the effect of hypoxia on fluorescence emission has rarely been studied. For this purpose, under hypoxic conditions, we investigated the kinetics of red and green fluorescence in HeLa cells from two fluorescent proteins, monomeric Kusabira Orange 2 (mKO2) and monomeric Azami Green (mAG), respectively, using the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci). In this system, cells in G1 or other phases emit red or green fluorescence, respectively. We found that hypoxia abrogated both red and green fluorescence about ~10h after the treatment, although their protein levels were almost maintained. The treatment did not significantly affect fluorescence in cells constitutively expressing the same fluorescent proteins lacking the ubiquitin ligase-binding domains. The abrogation of fluorescence resulted from a combination of ubiquitination-dependent degradation of pre-existing functional proteins during specific cell cycle phases, and the expression of newly synthesized non-fluorescent proteins containing non-oxidized chromophore during hypoxic treatment. Indeed, non-fluorescent cells after hypoxic treatment gradually developed fluorescence after reoxygenation in the presence of cycloheximide; kinetics of recovery were much faster for mAG than for mKO2. Using the Fucci system, we could clearly visualize for the first time the effect of hypoxia on the fluorescence kinetics of proteins expressed in living mammalian cells.

Abstract: Corneal keratocyte migration can impact both corneal clarity and refractive outcome following injury or refractive surgery. In this study, we investigated how culture conditions, ECM properties, and Rho kinase activity regulate the mechanics of keratocyte migration, using a nested collagen matrix model. Time-lapse imaging demonstrated that both serum and PDGF stimulate keratocyte migration into the outer matrix. Although the velocity of cell migration was similar, cells in serum were bipolar and induced significant matrix deformation during migration, whereas PDGF induced extension of branching dendritic processes with smaller, more localized force generation. These differences in cell-induced matrix reorganization were verified with a global matrix contraction assay and confocal reflection imaging, using both bovine and rat tail collagen. When constructs were detached from the substrate to lower the effective stiffness, migration was significantly reduced in serum; but was unchanged in PDGF. These differences in migration mechanics were mediated, in part, by Rho kinase. Overall, corneal keratocytes can effectively migrate through collagen matrices using varying degrees of cellular force generation. Low-contractility migration may facilitate keratocyte repopulation of the stroma following surgery or injury, without altering the structural and mechanical properties that are critical to maintaining corneal transparency.

Abstract: Endothelial cells (EC) are important in vasculogenesis and organogenesis during development and in the pathogenesis of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However, few EC specification factors are known and primary EC production remains inefficient. Based on recent studies implicating endoglin (Eng) in early vascular development and angiogenesis, we hypothesized that Eng may be an EC specification gene. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) were treated with recombinant Eng or a plasmid expressing the Eng ORF, and differentiated in the presence or absence of bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4). Expression of the mesoderm and EC marker genes, the known mediators of EC specification and their downstream targets was monitored by quantitative PCR, western blot, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. Functionality of the differentiated EC was assessed by in vitro angiogenesis assay and the induction of Icam1 expression in response to TNF-α treatment. Both recombinant Eng and forced Eng expression increased the number of functional EC expressing the EC marker genes VE-cadherin, vWF, and Tie2, and enhanced the effect of BMP4. The Eng-induced EC differentiation was independent of known mediators of EC specification such as Indian Hedgehog (IHH) and BMP4 or of BMP4/Smad1/5/8 signaling. These studies suggest that Eng is a novel EC specification gene.

Abstract: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have shown great promise for ischemic tissue repair. However, poor viability of transplanted BMSCs within ischemic tissues has limited their therapeutic potential. Apelin, an endogenous peptide, whose level is elevated following ischemia, has been shown to enhance survival of cardiomyocytes and neuronal cells during ischemia. We hypothesized that apelin-13 protects BMSCs from apoptotic death. In this paper we determined the potential mechanism of apelin-13 effects using cultured BMSCs from adult rats. Apoptosis was induced by the specific apoptotic insult serum deprivation (SD) for up to 36h. Apoptotic cell death was measured using immunostaining and Western blotting in the presence and absence of apelin-13 (0.1 to 5.0nM) co-applied during SD exposure. SD-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced by apelin-13 in a concentration-dependent manner. SD-induced mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation were largely prevented by apelin-13. The apelin-13 anti-apoptotic effects were blocked by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings indicate that apelin-13 is a survival factor for BMSCs and its anti-apoptotic property may prove to be of therapeutic significance in terms of exploiting BMSC-based transplantation therapy.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem (hES) cells have the dual ability to self-renew and differentiate into specialized cell types. However, in order to realize the full potential of these cells it is important to understand how the genes responsible for their unique characteristics are regulated. In this study we examine the regulation of the tropomyosin-related kinase (TRK) genes which encode for receptors important in hES cell survival and self-renewal. Although the TRK genes have been studied in many neuronal cell types, the regulation of these genes in hES cells is unclear. Our study demonstrates a novel regulatory relationship between the TRKC gene and the transcription factor SOX2. Our results found that hES cells highly express full-length and truncated forms of the TRKC gene. However, examination of the related TRKB gene showed a lower overall expression of both full-length and truncated forms. Through RNA interference, we knocked down expression levels of SOX2 in hES cells and examined the expression of TRKC, as well as TRKB. Upon loss of SOX2 we found that TRKC mRNA levels were significantly downregulated but TRKB levels remained unchanged, demonstrating an important regulatory dependence on SOX2 by TRKC. We also found that TRKC protein levels were also decreased after SOX2 knock down. Further analysis found the regulatory region of TRKC to be highly conserved among many mammals with potential SOX binding motifs. We confirmed a specific binding motif as a site that SOX2 utilizes to directly interact with the TRKC regulatory region. In addition, we found that SOX2 drives expression of the TRKC gene by activating a luciferase reporter construct containing the TRKC regulatory region and the SOX binding motif.

Abstract: Sphingosine kinases (SphKs) have been recognized as important proteins regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Of the two isoforms of SphK (SphK1 and SphK2), little is known about the functions of SphK2. Sodium butyrate (NaBT) has been established as a promising chemotherapeutic agent, but the precise mechanism for its effects is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of SphK2 in NaBT-induced apoptosis of HCT116 colon cancer cells. The results indicated that following NaBT treatment SphK2 was translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, leading to its accumulation in the cytoplasm; in the meantime, only mild apoptosis occurred. However, downregulation of SphK2 resulted in sensitized apoptosis, and overexpression of SphK2 led to even lighter apoptosis; these strongly indicate an inhibitory role of SphK2 in cell apoptosis induced by NaBT. After knocking down protein kinase D (PKD), another protein reported to be critical in cell proliferation/apoptosis process, by using siRNA, blockage of cytoplasmic accumulation of SphK2 and sensitized apoptosis following NaBT treatment were observed. The present study suggests that PKD and SphK2 may form a mechanism for the resistance of cancer cells to tumor chemotherapies, such as HCT116 colon cancer cells to NaBT, and these two proteins may become molecular targets for designation of new tumor-therapeutic drugs.

Abstract: The Slit family of secreted proteins acts through the Roundabout (Robo) receptors to repel axonal migration during central nervous system development. Emerging evidence shows that Slit/Robo interactions also play a role in angiogenesis. The effect of Robo signaling on endothelial cells has been shown to be context-dependent. However, the role of Slit/Robo in pericytes has been largely unexplored. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Slit2 on primary human pericytes and to address the underlying mechanisms, including the receptors potentially implicated. We demonstrate that both Robo1 and Robo4 are expressed by human pericytes. In the presence of their ligand Slit2, spontaneous and PDGF-induced migration of pericytes was impaired. This antimigratory activity of Slit-2 correlated with the inhibition of actin-based protrusive structures. Interestingly, human pericyte interaction with immobilized Slit2 was inhibited in the presence of anti-Robo1 and anti-Robo4 blocking antibodies, suggesting the implication of both receptors. These results add new insights into the role of Slit proteins during the angiogenic process that relies on the directional migration not only of endothelial cells but also of pericytes.
