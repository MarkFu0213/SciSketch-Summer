Abstract: Excessive mitochondrial fission in podocytes serves as a central hub for the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), and the thromboxane/prostaglandin receptor (TP receptor) plays a potential role in DN. However, regulation of the TP receptor during mitochondrial dynamics disorder in podocytes remains unknown. Here, we firstly reported novel mechanistic details of TP receptor effects on mitochondrial dynamics in podocytes under diabetic conditions. Expression of the TP receptor was significantly upregulated in podocytes under diabetic conditions both in vivo and in vitro. S18886 attenuated podocyte mitochondrial fission, glomerular injury and renal dysfunction in diabetic mice. Furthermore, inhibition of the TP receptor by both genetic and pharmacological methods dramatically reduced mitochondrial fission and attenuated podocyte injury induced by high glucose through regulating dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation and its subsequent translocation to mitochondria. In contrast, TP receptor overexpression and application of TP receptor agonist U46619 in these podocytes showed the opposite effect on mitochondrial fission and podocyte injury. Furthermore, treatment with Y27632, an inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase1 (ROCK1), significantly blunted more fragmented mitochondria and reduced podocyte injuries in podocytes with TP receptor overexpression or after U46619 treatment. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of Drp1 alleviated excessive mitochondrial fragmentation and podocyte damage in TP receptor overexpressing podocytes. Our data suggests that increased expression of the TP receptor can occur in a human cultured podocyte cell line and in podocytes derived from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice, which contributes to mitochondrial excessive fission and podocyte injury via ROCK1-Drp1 signaling.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the putative role of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase in the metabolic response of human aortic endothelial cells. This enzyme catalyses S-adenosylmethionine-mediated methylation of nicotinamide to methylnicotinamide. This reaction is accompanied by the reduction of the intracellular nicotinamide and S-adenosylmethionine content. This may affect NAD+ synthesis and various processes of methylation, including epigenetic modifications of chromatin. Particularly high activity of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase is detected in liver, many neoplasms as well as in various cells in stressful conditions. The elevated nicotinamide N-methyltransferase content was also found in endothelial cells treated with statins. Although the exogenous methylnicotinamide has been postulated to induce a vasodilatory response, the specific metabolic role of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase in vascular endothelium is still unclear. Treatment of endothelial cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide evokes several metabolic and functional consequences which built a multifaceted physiological response of endothelium to bacterial infection. Among the spectrum of biochemical changes substantially elevated protein level of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase was particularly intriguing. Here it has been shown that silencing of the nicotinamide N-methyltransferase gene influences several changes which are observed in cells treated with lipopolysaccharide. They include altered energy metabolism and rearrangement of the mitochondrial network. A complete explanation of the mechanisms behind the protective consequences of the nicotinamide N-methyltransferase deficiency in cells treated with lipopolysaccharide needs further investigation.

Abstract: In the scope of solar cell characterisation, spatially resolved imaging (SRI) methods (EL, PL and LBIC) have long been a standard procedure for valuable in-depth evaluation and extraction of various spatially resolved material properties, especially those related to the electrical behaviour. While this extraction can be straightforward in the case of laterally homogeneous devices, the situation is vastly different when the structural features are laterally varying, such as in the case of interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cells. We show that in the case of laterally varying devices inherent device optical properties play a far more important role in determining the measured profile in this case and may indeed overshadow any underlying electrical effects. We therefore propose and validate a methodology that couples SRI characterisation with advanced bottom-up simulation of IBC solar cells. The method fully accounts for lateral device variability and allows for accurate extraction of the underlying electrical phenomena. We demonstrate the applicability of the method on state-of-the-art high-efficiency IBC solar cells, and explain the key factors, which could lead to misinterpretation of the results obtained solely by SRI measurements.

Abstract: Flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) fabricated on plastic substrates have great potential applications in numerous emerging fields such as portable/wearable electronics, automobiles, and flying objects due to their high efficiency, low cost, and light weight. However, most of the reported flexible PSCs based on plastic substrate use expensive and fragile ITO as transparent electrodes, resulting in significant performance degradation after continuous bending. Here, we develop an indium-free AZO/Cu/Ag/AZO multilayer transparent electrode deposited on PET by magnetron sputtering technique and utilize it to fabricate of flexible PSCs. It is demonstrated that predepositing an ultrathin Cu layer on the AZO layer can significantly reduce the permeation threshold of the subsequent grown Ag layer, thereby improving the optoelectronic properties of the deposited multilayer transparent electrode. The highest figure of merit value of 3.8 × 10−2 Ω−1 was obtained for the AZO(40 nm)/Cu(0.1 nm)/Ag(7 nm)/AZO (40 nm) electrode, which has an average relative optical transmittance in the visible light range (400–800 nm) of 90.77 % and sheet resistance of 9.9 Ω/sq. The flexible PSCs based on the optimized AZO/Cu/Ag/AZO electrode achieve power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.68 %. Moreover, they can maintain 90 % of the initial PCE even after 5000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 8 mm.

Abstract: The intermittency and instability of solar irradiation can be effectively overcome by using medium- and high-temperature composite phase change materials (PCMs) for latent heat storage. Studies using metals and organics as phase change materials show that the phase change behavior of mesoporous composite phase change materials is affected by the constraint effect, and its thermophysical parameters (such as phase change point and phase change latent heat) are significantly different from those of macro volume. However, at present, research on molten salt phase change materials, which are widely used in the field of medium- and high-temperature research, is insufficient. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with experimental methods were used to analyze the changes in the freezing point, supercooling degree and enthalpy of solidification of solar salt in mesoporous composite phase change materials, which were based on the self-diffusion coefficient and the potential energy-temperature curve. The results show that a larger mesoporous size leads to a higher freezing point of the solar salt. At the same scale, with the increase in Al2O3 content in the framework, the freezing point of the solar salt first decreases and then increases. The supercooling degree of solar salt decreases with increasing scale. When the mass content of Al2O3 in the framework is in the range of 25 wt%-40 wt%, the supercooling degree of solar salt increases gradually; in contrast, it decreases in the range of 40 wt%-50 wt%, and finally, it increases again in the range of 50 wt%-75 wt%. The latent heat of phase transition increases with increasing scale. With the increase in Al2O3 content in the framework, the latent heat of phase transformation first decreases, then increases, and finally stabilizes. Al2O3 and SiO2 in the interface of the frame can promote heterogeneous nucleation and provide a substrate for the nucleation of molten solar salt. They also reduce the degree of supercooling. It is found that the effect of Al2O3 on nucleation is more significant.

Abstract: The mechanical behaviors of 304 and 316 L steels was investigated in air and in solar salt with different contents of chloride impurity under slow strain rate tensile (SSRT) tests using a novel experimental approach at 565 °C. Results show that the yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) are negligibly affected by the molten salt corrosion whereas the ductility decreases with increasing contents of chloride. Corrosion cracks initiate and propagate along the grain boundary due to its higher corrosion rate and incremental oxide rupture. Moreover, a damage model that captures the corrosion and chloride effects is proposed and validated.

Abstract: Nanofluids are considered as a new generation of heat transfer fluids since they exhibit thermophysical properties improvements compared with conventional heat transfer fluids. The high thermal conductivity of nanofluids and even the isobaric specific heat enhancements over conventional liquids make these colloidal suspensions very attractive in many research areas, including solar energy. In this work, nanofluids based on tungsten disulphide (WS2) nanosheets have been prepared from the thermal oil currently used as heat transfer fluid in Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants. The high aspect ratio of WS2 bidimensional nanostructures provides high long-term colloidal stability to the nanofluids and facilitates heat transport. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and polyethylene glycol have been used as surfactants to improve the exfoliation process and enhance the colloidal stability of the nanomaterial dispersions. Some properties such as density and viscosity of the base fluid have not been significantly altered by the presence of WS2 nanosheets in the base fluid. However, studies on the thermal properties of nanofluids have shown promising results with increases in thermal conductivity of up to 33% and heat transfer coefficient by 21% over the base fluid. Furthermore, it has been estimated that the overall efficiency of the CSP system could be improved by 31% by replacing the conventional thermal fluid with 2D-WS2-based nanofluids.

Abstract: Radiative cooling is a method of sustainable cooling without energy consumption; however, a strong cooling effect increases the energy consumption for heating in cold winters. Therefore, a temperature-adaptive radiative cooling coating (TARCC) consisting of a radiative cooling underlayer based on a spectral-selectivity porous polymer membrane (PM) and a thermochromic top layer based on a thermochromic microcapsule hybrid coating (TMHC) was designed and fabricated in this study. The color of the TMHC can change with ambient temperature, and the solar reflectance of the coating can be adjusted independently. The results showed that the TMHC became transparent at high temperatures, and the overall solar reflectance of PM/TMHC was 91.25%, while the TMHC became rose red at low temperatures and absorbed visible light, which could reduce the solar reflectance of PM/TMHC to 72.71%. In summer, when PM/TMHC is exposed to direct sunlight with an intensity of 900 W/m2, the backside temperature of the coating is 7.1 °C lower than that of traditional colored coatings and is also lower than that of TARCC with commercial white thermal insulation coating (CC/TMHC). In winter, when the solar intensity drops below 500 W/m2, PM/TMHC maintains its color, and its temperature is 6 °C higher than that of the PM, achieving all-season thermal regulation. Moreover, the light fatigue resistance of the coating was significantly improved using a light stabilizer. This study provides a new method for developing intelligent building coatings, with great development prospects.

Abstract: Passivation of semiconductor surfaces is crucial to reduce carrier recombination losses and thereby enhance the device performance of solar cells and other semiconductor devices. Thin-film stacks of phosphorus oxide (POx) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) have recently been shown to provide excellent passivation of semiconductor surfaces, including crystalline silicon and indium phosphide, and can also be highly interesting for passivation of other semiconductor materials such as Ge and III-V semiconductors. On silicon, the excellent passivation is attributed to the combination of a high positive fixed charge and a very low interface defect density. On InP nanowires, application of the POx/Al2O3 stacks improves charge carrier lifetime threefold as compared to unpassivated nanowires. In this work, we review and summarize recent results obtained on POx/Al2O3 stacks for semiconductor surface passivation. Several topics are discussed, including the passivation performance on various semiconductor surfaces, the processing of the POx and Al2O3 layers, the role of the capping layer, and aspects related to device integration. The POx/Al2O3 stacks feature some unique properties, including an unusually high positive fixed charge density, a low interface defect density, and can be prepared over a wide deposition temperature range. These unique properties arise in part from the mixing process that occurs between the POx and Al2O3 layers, which upon post-deposition annealing leads to the formation of AlPO4. The surface passivation provided by POx/Al2O3 stacks is highly stable and the stack can be used to conformally coat high-aspect-ratio structures such as nanowires, showing their promise for use in semiconductor devices.

Abstract: In this work, a well-known hole conductor spiro-OMeTAD was introduced into viologen-based all-in-one electrochromic devices (ECDs) as anode material, which exhibited panchromatic switching between colorless and truly black with efficient performance, involving fast response speed (around 0.5 s for both coloring and bleaching processes), high optical contrast (over 90% throughout the whole visible region), and high coloration efficiency (450.26 cm2 C−1 at 514 nm, 248.31 cm2 C−1 at 607 nm and 315.51 cm2 C−1 at 888 nm). Highly stability was achieved with less than 10% decay in optical contrast after 10000 cycles switching at 514 nm and 607 nm. Moreover, ECDs based on spiro-OMeTAD/HV had a wide working temperature window, and operated efficiently under both low-temperature below −40 °C and high-temperature up to 60 °C. Most importantly, the suppression of the interfacial molecular aggregation and degradation on anode electrode in viologen-based all-in-one electrochromic devices was demonstrated to be crucial for long-term switching stability for the first time.

Abstract: A high efficiency in solar thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems is achieved by recycling photons to the emitter in a cell with a high out-of-band reflectivity. Ideally, if all out-of-band photons can be recovered in a blackbody emitter, the effect would be equivalent to that when using a spectrally selective emitter. However, in practice, it is difficult to fully recover large number of out-of-band photons emitted from blackbody emitters. Meanwhile, spectrally selective emitters generally have lower thermal stability than blackbody emitters, resulting low in-band photon flux. Considering these practical constraints, our analysis demonstrates that the combination of spectrally selective absorbers and spectrally selective emitters has a higher system efficiency than the other cases using blackbody absorbers or emitters, even in systems that exhibit a high confinement performance at practical input densities of 200 W/cm2. A confined system with a high thermal radiation transport efficiency of 0.9 is constructed in which a tungsten cube coated with a hafnium oxide layer was used as a spectrally selective absorber and spectrally selective emitter. A total experimental system efficiency of 7.5% was achieved; using the model of the experimental system, we estimated a 13% system efficiency for a system containing a cell with Roob = 0.98, and a 19.5% system efficiency for a system with improved spectral selectivity of the absorber and emitter.

Abstract: To develop novel materials with active photothermal conversion and latent heat storage properties, the shape-stabilized phase change material was fabricated via self-assembly method employing stearic acid (SA) as heat storage medium, graphene oxide and MXene as hybrid matrix (GM) and photothermal conversion agent. The morphology, structure, properties and phase transition behavior were investigated by various techniques. The results shown that SA/GM has sandwich-like structure and SA is confined between matrix nanosheets in multiple crystallographic forms. Due to the superposition of host-guest interaction and intrinsic van der Waals force between nanosheets, the primary melting temperature of SA/GM climbs 27.7 °C approximately than that of SA, as well as the total latent heat decreases by 28.55%–30.85% compared with theoretical values. The confinement effect increases the crystallization activation energy of confined SA, and leads to the formation of non-phase transition layer, transitional confinement layer and proximate bulk layer. However, the above observations are applicable to fatty acids/GM, only the suppressed latent heat occurs in all GM-matrix composites. In addition, the SA/GM7 has excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, as high as 93.34%, and gradient latent heat storage capacity, 45.96 J g−1 at 74.43 °C and 91.19 J g−1 at 92.37 °C.

Abstract: High-efficiency silicon solar cells depend on passivating contact structure to decrease recombination losses at the crystalline silicon (c-Si) surface and the interface of metal/Si contact. Tunnel oxide passivating contact (TOPCon) technology is one of these structures, in which heavily doped poly-Si is placed over a SiOx layer grown directly on the c-Si wafer. The passivation performance can be further improved by depositing a thin aluminum oxide (AlOx) layer on one side of the symmetric cell structure, which is attributed to the reduced interfacial defects, facilitated formation of carrier collector layer, and excellent field-effect passivation. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) may be utilized to produce high-quality and pinhole-free AlOx capping layers due to its controllability, homogeneity, and conformality. However, insufficient substrate surface activity is a challenge faced in AlOx deposition because it can impair Al(CH3)3 nucleation, resulting in an island-like growth over the first few ALD cycles, ultimately deteriorating the passivation effect of AlOx. In this study, we optimized the deposition process of ALD AlOx through a series of single-factor experiments. Subsequently, alternative substrate treatment methods were tested to compare the performance. In particular, we proposed a two-step interface engineering process (chemical mechanical polishing + RCA SC-2 treatment) to enhance the comprehensive performance of the ALD AlOx layer, achieving a high iVOC of 726 mV and low J0 of 5.4 fA/cm2, compared with a reference poly-Si/c-Si passivating contact (iVOC = 703 mV, J0 = 19.4 fA/cm2). The result was interpreted in terms of gradually improving substrate surface quality and wettability, together with the gradually decreasing thickness of the interfacial oxide layer. The circumvent of the island growth mode improved the growth quality of the subsequent film, effectively compressed the ALD cycle needed for stable growth, and enhanced the passivation property. Altogether, the present data may guide further efforts to obtain high-efficiency silicon-based solar cells by arising the interface engineering.

Abstract: Photocatalytic building envelope materials harness sunlight to activate self-cleaning and de-polluting properties, which can help mitigate the urban heat island effect and abate urban pollution. The performance of roofing membranes manufactured with bright-white photocatalytic (BWP) granules, and with a non-photocatalytic bright-white control (BWC), were evaluated. The solar reflectance of unexposed specimens was 0.56 for BWP and 0.60 for BWC. Small changes in solar reflectance with respect to the initial values were observed during 22 months of field exposure between March 2020 and January 2022, indicating good resistance to soiling. Changes in the de-pollution capacity during the same period were quantified with a bench-scale method adapted from the ISO Standard 22197-1, in which unexposed and aged specimens were placed horizontally inside a flow chamber admitting clean air enriched with nitric oxide (NO) under UV irradiation. In addition, a pilot-scale approach was developed to evaluate the photocatalytic performance of the same materials under more realistic urban environmental conditions. An outdoor exposure chamber was designed and built with a rectangular stainless-steel main body topped with a UV-transparent fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) thin film. The area of the 30 cm × 90 cm BWP specimen tested in the outdoor chamber was more than one order of magnitude larger than those evaluated in the benchtop apparatus. The BWP membrane was pre-activated by field exposure for 75 days. The pilot-scale chamber operation was validated in the laboratory using UV lamps to irradiate the BWP membrane and a reference TiO2-coated aluminum plate (P25, 1 g m−2) of the same dimensions. Tests showed comparable or better performance of the BWP membrane with respect to the P25 film. Its de-pollution capacity was tested with direct sunlight irradiation in Berkeley, California (37.88° N, 122.25° W) during June 2020. Urban air was enriched with NO, or with a NO/NO2 mixture, and circulated through the pilot-scale chamber at two different flows: 1.1 and 440 L min−1. The gas phase concentrations of NO and NO2 were measured upstream and downstream of the tested specimen with a chemiluminescence analyzer. Upstream levels of the challenge gases were high but realistic, not exceeding 200 ppb. The UV irradiance outdoors (15–30 W m−2) was higher and more variable than in indoor tests (11.5 W m−2), leading to overall higher NO deposition velocity under direct sunlight. In outdoor measurements, the NO deposition velocity increased at higher irradiances. When NO was the only challenge gas, a fraction of NO was oxidized to NO2 resulting in lower NO and higher NO2 downstream concentrations. However, when tested with NO/NO2 mixtures, the concentration of both compounds decreased during irradiation, and the surface showed a faster loss of photoactivity for NO2, compared with NO. These effects are consistent with those observed in the laboratory. The NOx deposition velocity outdoors was 0.7 and 105 μmol h−1 m−2 for the low and high air flow, respectively.

Abstract: To make the jump from laboratories to commercial production for perovskite solar cells, it is necessary to develop devices in an ambient environment using materials and methods that can be scalable. Here, blade coating followed by vacuum quenching is used to manufacture the FACs-based perovskite solar cells with the additive of MACl under an ambient environment (30%–57% RH), where FA is formamidinium and MA is methylammonium. The vacuum allows quick removal of solvent to initiate the nucleation process and create the intermediate phase. To control the nucleation and crystallization, the additive MACl is utilized to manipulate the intermediate phase. Besides perovskites, another key component is the hole transport material. Although nickel oxide exhibits good photostability and can be scalable for the inverted device architecture, the main drawback is low cell efficiency. This work solves it by tuning the cation ratio of Pb2+ to A+ and light soaking, achieving a champion efficiency of 19.5%. The encapsulated solar cells exhibit long-term photostability, maintaining 96% of their original efficiency and 91.5% of their maximum efficiency over 648 h under one sun at 45°C and 50%–60% relative humidity. This work demonstrates an economical and highly scalable process, promising for commercial-scale manufacturing.

Abstract: Surface morphology plays a crucial role in influencing the film quality and photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of a Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cell. Herein, the bismuth (Bi) doping strategy to improve the surface morphology of the solution-processed CZTSSe film for high solar cell efficiency is reported. With a two-step selenization strategy to facilitate the Bi-doped CZTSSe (CZTBiSSe) phase formation, improving the crystalline quality of the absorber, increasing the carrier mobility, and reducing the band tailing, a cell efficiency of 6.94% has been achieved. These results demonstrate the significance of Bi doping into CZTSSe to improve the device's performance. This work offers new insights into the effects of Bi doping on CZTSSe via a solution-processed approach and provides a deeper understanding of the origin of the efficiency improvement of Bi-doped CZTSSe thin film solar cells.

Abstract: The presence of silicon oxyphosphorus bonds in the heavily phosphorus (P)-doped n+-type polycrystalline silicon film (n+-poly Si) of TOPCon solar cell has been mainly revealed through a depth-profile X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of chemical components. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern is applied to the verification of recrystallized phases in the n+-poly Si film, while high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) pattern is used for distinguishing the crystallinity and the elemental segregation. The test sample is of a typical rear passivation contact stacks of c-Si/SiOx/n+-poly Si/SiO2, in which the n+-poly Si layer is heavily phosphorus-doped by ion implantation of as-deposited intrinsic thin film through low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and recrystallization at 900 °C afterward. In the whole n+-poly Si layer, XPS P 2p electronic states at 129.8, 133.4 and 136.8 eV have been detected and assigned to be Si–P (or P–P), O–P and P–O–P bonds, respectively. In addition, the thermodynamic functions, such as the Gibbs free energy and mole formation energy of likely chemical bonds under the lowest energy as well as temperature-composition fraction (T-CF) phase diagram, are also implemented in the verification of the derivatives of phosphorus oxides.

Abstract: Emerging multi-drug resistance in recent Salmonella Typhi isolates, causative agent of enteric Typhoid fever, compelled us to investigate alternative therapeutic strategies. The present study encompassed virtual screening, ADMET screening as well as antibacterial activity prediction to shortlist potent lead molecules whose binding affinities (BAs) were checked against major druggable S. Typhi targets. BA profile revealed a deoxy-tetradeutero- curcumin derivative to be novel bioactive compound having high BA towards UDP-N-acetylmuramate–L-alanine ligase (MurC) protein involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. Molecular docking indicated that our lead {Binding energy (BE)= −8.00 ± 0.02 kcal/mol}could competitively bind to MurC with respect to its natural ligand ATP (BE= −7.65 ± 0.19 kcal/mol). The lead also possessed superior binding and inhibition profile against MurC than other commercial antibiotics. This BE was contributed by Hydrogen (H-) bonds and numerous non-canonical interactions with the evolutionary conserved active-site residues. From molecular docking and coarse-grained dynamics simulations, it was inferred that the novel curcumin derivative was predicted to be potential competitive inhibitor of ATP for MurC-catalytic domain having low relative RMSF (0.59 Å) to inhibit MurC-induced peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The inferences drawn from the study can open new portals for designing efficient therapeutic strategies against S. Typhi.

Abstract: Micro-concentrator photovoltaics (micro-CPV) is a branch of the CPV technology where the size of the solar cell is reduced below the millimeter range to permit novel manufacturing methods for cost reductions and maintaining high efficiencies by using high performance optical materials. The reduction in size of all the components demands a very good optical quality of the primary lenses to achieve high concentrations and high optical efficiencies. PMMA or silicon-on-glass are the most used materials for CPV primary optics, but PMMA reliability against UV weathering is questionable and silicone has a large coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch with respect to glass, which introduces a large thermal sensitivity in the optical efficiency. In contrast, direct glass molding is a promising alternative due to benefits such as a high Abbe number (lower dispersion losses), great mechanical properties, low CTE, low thermal coefficient of the refractive index (dn/dT), and a proven outdoor reliability with very little degradation. Furthermore, glass can generally be manufactured with high throughput, straightforward, and cost-effective compression or roller molding processes. In this work we present a collaboration with the company Holophane S.A.S. in France that resulted in the manufacturing of several micro-CPV lens arrays of plano-convex lenses with a design tailored to the requirements imposed by the manual compression molding process. A comprehensive experimental characterization has been carried out based on surface metrology and functional measurements with a collimated-light solar simulator, and the results are compared with ray-tracing simulations. The measured optical efficiency at the design concentration of 178X is 79.2 ± 2.5% for the whole array with a best lens efficiency of 82.2%. Furthermore, the best performing array has been used to assemble a demonstrator mono-module, which has been characterized outdoors. The outdoor characterization shows very good thermal and spectral stability of the lens array with an I–V curve fill factor of 84.8 ± 1.9% and an electrical efficiency of 27.2 ± 1.8%. The experience gained with these prototypes will lead to further optimization in the manufacturing process to increase the optical performance, and to a larger scale manufacturing for micro-CPV modules. This works paves the way for the development of high-efficiency robust glass-based micro-CPV modules able to generate maximum energy yield per area in space-constrained applications.

Abstract: Solar cells are gradually becoming a common substitute for fossil fuels in order to address the escalating energy crisis and environmental change. Many wearable or outdoor electronic devices are powered by portable solar cells, but due to structural limitations and dramatic increases in heat dissipation, portable solar cell efficiency declines sharply with heat accumulation and temperature rises, and thermal non-uniformity reduces device reliability. An efficient thermal management solution is needed to address these crucial thermal issues. In this study, a novel composite PCM with efficiently enhanced thermal conductivity (ETC-PCM) has been created using graphene, epoxy resin (EP), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) by strong cross-linking and thermally induced structural rearrangement. Compared to the composite PCM with normally enhanced thermal conductivity (NTC-PCM) by traditional mechanical mixing, enhancements are made to ETC-PCM's cutability, flexibility, and latent heat. More significantly, the thermal conductivity of ETC-PCM increased by 157% to 0.51 W/m·K with the inclusion of a 1.5% effective thermal conductivity filler component. In a composite PV system with direct integration of flexible solar cells and ETC-PCM, the ETC-PCM also exhibited superior thermal management in both time and space dimensions, with enhanced thermal uniformity and long-term reliability of the PV system. The outstanding thermal and mechanical properties of ETC-PCM have shown tremendous potential in many applications, such as solar cell thermal management, solar/electric energy harvesting, thermal energy storage, etc.

Abstract: Recently, corrosion of nanoparticles molten salt-based nanofluids studies have emerged as Concentrating Solar Power plants provide a low carbon alternative to produce electricity. Enhancing the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of molten salts by using inorganic nanoparticles has been targeted as a strategy to decrease the overall investment cost of CSP systems. However, there is scarce and insufficient information about their effect on the corrosion behaviour of nanofluids, whether the nanoparticle content increases it or have no significant effect. The scatter data found show no clear agreement and the measurements are done under different conditions (temperature, time, impurities, nanoparticle's chemical nature and concentration, metal and alloy composition, testing method). In this context, the authors evaluated the effect of SiO2 nanoparticles concentration in an industrial-grade Solar Salt in contact with four different alloys; AISI 1045, 304H, 316L and Inconel 600 by isothermal tests, 500 °C up to 2160 h. The effect of nanoparticles, 0.5% and 1% wt., was evaluated in comparison with Solar Salt industrial grade. The corrosion rate of the samples decreased in the following order AISI 1045 > 304H > 316L > Inconel 600 and nanoparticles increased in general and to a different extent the corrosion rate of the alloys. The one that experiences the highest nanoparticle effect is stainless steel 304H, followed by AISI 1045 and Inconel. For 316L, no significant differences can be seen. The applicability assessment carried out has shown that molten salt nitrate-based nanofluids can be used with Inconel 600, 304H and 316L in long-term service high-temperature applications such as CSP.

Abstract: Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) is desired to reduce carbon emissions from residential and commercial buildings. In this application, the controlling the visual impact of BIPV module with preserving PV performance remains a great challenge since the appearance of conventional PV modules is not favorable for building skins in most cases because of their dark colors. In this paper, we report on the color control of crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV modules by introducing the structural colors based on the interference effect. We apply the structural colors to the cover glass of PV minimodules with textured surfaces. The glass texturing is realized by sandblasting technique that allows us to form various textured surfaces depending on sandblasting conditions. High flexibility of structural colors is demonstrated by realizing various colors including violet, cyan, green, and orange using dielectric multilayers deposited on planar and textured glass sheets. These colored glass sheets are applied to c-Si PV minimodules, which exhibit high efficiencies (>18%) with distinct colors. The efficiency of colored PV minimodules depends strongly on their colors, as the efficiency loss originates solely from the optical loss by the colored glasses. In addition, the color difference at various view angles is evaluated by reflectance measurement with an integral sphere and compared in a CIE color system. It clarifies that surface texturing by sandblasting mitigates the angular dependence of structural colors substantially, which is also observable by our eyes. Besides, surface texturing is effective to mitigate the glare effect as well. Therefore, the combination of structural colors and surface texturing is a promising way to realize fascinating colors and a high energy yield simultaneously in BIPV modules.

Abstract: In recent years paraffin-based organic phase change materials have been widely employed in thermal-energy storage systems due to their relatively high latent thermal capacity. However, the risk of leaks, low thermal conductivity, and low light-to-thermal conversion capacity has, to date, limited their use in the storage of solar thermal energy. To address these issues, we have developed a novel bio-based shape-stable organic phase change composite (SSOPCC) by encapsulating paraffin C22 with the double-supporting component consisting of poly (styrene-b-ethylene-co-butylene-b-styrene) (SEBS) and expanded perlite (EP), and improving the thermal conductivity and increasing the sensitive light response rate by introducing boron nitride (BN) and a lignin biomass-derived carbon material carbonized lignin (CL). Our investigations show that, with the introduction of the BN sheets and biomass CL into the SSOPCCs, the thermal conductivity of the composites is improved (from 0.407 W/mK to 0.596 W/mK), and the light-to-thermal conversion ability is also considerably enhanced. The obtained SSOPCCs possess not only good thermal storage performance, such as high latent heat enthalpy (as large as 185.5 J/g) and high relative enthalpy efficiency (>95%) but also exhibit excellent thermal stability and reliability after multiple heating-cooling cycles. The findings of this study will both provide a promising way for fabricating new bio-based phase change composites for real solar energy storage and conversion applications and broaden the high-value utilization of lignin-based biomass.

Abstract: Due to their tunable bandgap and low manufacturing cost, metal halide perovskite solar cells are attractive for ambient/indoor light-harvesting applications. In this work, we evaluate p-i-n perovskite solar cells fabricated with MeO-2PACz, a molecular monolayer hole extraction layer, as potential candidates for ambient light-harvesting applications. Two triple-cation mixed halide lead perovskite absorbers are compared, one with high bromide content (Br/I ratio 1:2, bandgap 1.72 eV, 16.1% power conversion efficiency) and one with low bromide content (Br/I ratio 1:11, bandgap 1.57 eV, 19.1% power conversion efficiency). Both materials demonstrated good stability while operating under simulated sunlight at the maximum power point for 100 h, a cumulative light dose comparable to over two years of ambient use. After 100 h operation, however, the measured device efficiency fell temporarily due to a transient loss of output current before returning to the nominal level after a long recovery period in the dark. These transient losses were more apparent in the wide bandgap device under strong light and were likely caused by light-induced halide segregation. After recovery, both devices retained good performance under a wide range of light intensities. Under a simulated ambient light source (835 lx white LED), the power conversion efficiency of the wide bandgap device reached 30.4%.

Role of hypoxia on microRNA-dependant regulation of HGFA – HGF – c-Met signalling pathway in human progenitor and mature endothelial cells,

Abstract: Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is considered to be one of the key pro-angiogenic cytokines that stimulates endothelial cells to proliferate and migrate. The activation of the precursor form of HGF is primarily undertaken by the serine protease HGFA. Research indicates that HIF-1α hypoxia stimulates the expression of HGFA, which is synthesized by a range of cells including fibroblasts, endothelium, and macrophages. To date, little is known about the potential role of epigenetic factors in the regulation of the HGFA – HGF – c-Met signalling pathway. The literature suggests that there are several microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) directly affecting the expression of c-Met under normoxic conditions. The main objective of the research described was to explore the effect of chemically-induced hypoxia on the expression of miRNA molecules in human progenitor and mature endothelial cells, with particulate attention paid to those miRNAs that may specifically affect the HGFA – HGF – c-Met signalling pathway. This publication sheds new light on the role of miRNAs in hypoxia, as well as identifying several miRNAs directly involved in the regulation of HGFA, HGF and c-Met expression in hypoxic conditions. The results indicate that hsa-miR-335–5p, hsa-miR-425–5p and hsa-miR-101–3p are the major miRNAs that appear to play an important role in the regulation of the HGFA – HGF – c-Met signalling pathway.

Abstract: Scale-up applications in solar energy storage of phase change materials (PCMs) are hindered by the limitation of solid-liquid leakage and lack of light absorption ability. Nano-porous carbon (NPC) with abundant light-trapping structures and high specific surface area was synthesized using attapulgite (ATP) with a rod-like fiber structure as a template and glucose as the carbon source. Novel composite form-stable PCMs (FSPCMs) were then prepared by impregnating stearic acid (SA) into the NPC to solve these limitations via a vacuum impregnation method. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that the resulting composite FSPCMs possessed extremely high SA loading capacity (70.5–76.5%) and thermal storage density (160.7–166.5 J/g). Meanwhile, the effect of carbonization temperature on the photo-thermal conversion capacity of composite FSPCMs was studied. Raman and XPS results indicate that the number of carbon defect sites increase with increasing carbonization temperature. These carbon defect sites form the light-trapping structure that can enhance the internal reflection of light, further leading to the excellent photo-thermal conversion capacity of composite FSPCMs. NPC endows the composite FSPCMs with ultrahigh photo-thermal conversion efficiency (up to 94.5%). The composite FSPCMs without a significant change in latent heat enthalpy after 200 melting/freezing cycles implied satisfactory thermal reliability. In addition, a water-based solar heating coating was prepared with composite FSPCMs, which can effectively heat water under sunlight and make the water kept at a comfortable temperature for 21.7 min under no sunlight. Therefore, the prepared composite FSPCMs exhibit a promising application in the novel solar water heating systems.

Abstract: Temperature coefficient (TC) is a critical operational parameter for solar modules. Amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell is usually considered as a good choice for installation in hot climates because of its lowest TC amongst silicon solar cells. Recently, we have found that light soaking can activate efficient boron doping in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), which improves the efficiency of SHJ solar cells by enhanced field effect passivation and declined series resistance. In this study, we further report that high temperature can boost this light-induced doping effect. This implies that SHJ solar cells can generate more electricity than estimated by indoor International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards in light abundant locations with hot climates. As a consequence, a 100 MW solar plant comprising SHJ solar modules will gain an extra income of more than 2 million U.S. dollars in a 25-year operation period. Additionally, for the first time, we demonstrate that the dark conductance of phosphorus-doped a-Si:H (n-a-Si:H) increases more greatly than that of boron-doped a-Si:H (p-a-Si:H) after one-sun illumination. This finding has an important implication for bifacial solar modules.

Abstract: Antimony chalcogenides emerge as a type of efficient material for solar cells. In particular, antimony sulfide-selenide (SbSSe) has attracted significant interests based on their simple preparation, excellent photoelectric performance, and tunable bandgaps. In this study, by applying energy-band engineering technologies, we achieved carrier transport balance and light absorption balance for SbSSe single- and triple-junction solar cells, respectively. First in a single junction solar cell, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of SbSSe solar cells is improved from 13.14% to 16.16% with a front-gradient Se content structure compared to a non-gradient Se content SbSSe solar cell. This improvement is attributed to the additional electric field induced by such a gradient bandgap, promoting the carrier motion. Consequently, the balance of carrier transport is realized by adjusting the drift velocities of holes and electrons simultaneously, thereby surpassing carrier recombination and improving the device parameters of short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). In a next step, an SbSSe of advanced gradient bandgap has been applied as the absorber layer of middle-cell in an antimony chalcogenide based triple-junction solar cell. Based on the high Jsc and FF advantages of SbSSe sub-cells with front-gradient Se content structure, the uniform absorption of sunlight in each sub-cell and current matching of tandem solar cells could be easily realized. Eventually, the PCE of the triple-junction solar cell exhibits an enhancement from 17.34% to 19.51%. Our results demonstrate that the application of energy-band engineering technology can effectively improve device performance, providing theoretical guidance for the refined design and nanomanufacturing development of antimony chalcogenide solar cells.

Abstract: Microwave-assisted WO3 photoelectrodes have been rarely studied in terms of their growth mechanism and photoelectrochemical (PEC) application for energy generation and waste water organic pollutants removal. Microwave-assisted rapid synthesis technique is proposed in the current study as a means of reducing the deposition time of tungsten oxide nanosheets on tungsten foil. XRD and PEC studies indicate that WO3-NS photoanodes with an active (002) plane exhibited optimal PEC performance, whereas (020) suffered from charge carrier separation during the prolongation of microwave cycles from 1 to 5. Under 1.5 G simulated sunlight, 100 mWcm2, the optimum WO3-MW-3 cycle photoanode has a maximum photocurrent density of 1.68 mA cm2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl compared to the transparent conducting WO3/FTO substrates. The optimum morphology and large specific surface areas of WO3-NS's lead to enhanced charge separation in WO3-MW-3 cycle photoanodes. The WO3-MW-3 cycle photoanodes demonstrated 71 and 41 μmol of H2 and O2 evolution, respectively, within 180 min, while degradation of PEC orange II dye reached 98.5%. The microwave-induced systems can be used to produce a wide variety of nanostructured photoanodes for photovoltaics and electrocatalysis.

Abstract: Polymers are essential for long-term green energy production by photovoltaics (PV). We created a unique dataset that links electrical performance data of 28,030 PV modules, combined into 1295 strings and 423 inverters with the identity of the backsheet (BS) materials of each of the tested modules. This dataset gives an insight into BS-versatility and resulting impact on the insulation resistance of strings and inverters. The BSs were analyzed using near infrared absorption spectroscopy (NIRA) plus visual inspection in the field. The insulation resistance (Riso) of selected modules and strings was measured on-site. Furthermore, reported ground impedance (GI) values were evaluated with respect to an inverter-specific threshold below which the inverters do not start operation. We differentiated seven BS-types, the three most frequent being polyamide (PA), fluorinated coating (FC), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Although modules with PA show often BS cracking, the insulation resistance was above the threshold. Similar, the GI of inverters with modules with PVDF-BSs was high. Modules with FC-BSs feature generally low Riso–values on module-, string-, and on inverter level. Evaluating historic data reveals an increase in frequency of GI-values below the threshold for inverters connected to modules with exclusively FC-BSs. While inverters with modules having PA- or PVDF-BSs function as expected, inverters with modules having FC-BSs require maintenance to keep power yield on an acceptable level. The dataset collected in the present work highlights that the choice of BS-material of PV-modules is essential for reliable operation of PV power stations.

Abstract: One of the biggest challenges of concentrating solar power (CSP) is achieving cost-reduction in the thermal energy storage (TES) system. Operating conditions of molten salt CSP plants includes intermittent exposure of the TES tanks materials (i.e., carbon steel, stainless-steel) in contact with molten salt (NaNO3–KNO3). This manuscript evaluates the lessons learnt in the performance of such tank materials with molten salts under continuous and intermittent exposure in a demo plant for indirect thermal storage at 400 °C. This study shows that the hot tank upper section developed breakaway corrosion phenomena generating oxides layers, which easily delaminates from the base metal. This damage is produced by the tank preheating system, which introduced a non-controlled amount of CO2 inside the tanks. Then, the carbon steel upper section is exposed in the hot tank to a mixture composed by CO2, water vapour, and chlorides at high temperature, producing this type of attack. The materials tested are carbon and low alloyed steels types A516Gr70, A387Gr11 and A387Gr5, Cr–Mo steel A387Gr9, stainless steels types A304L, A316L and A347. The lessons learnt have been implemented in the commissioning of new commercial plants successfully.

Loss of Pleckstrin homology like domain, family A, member 1 promotes type Ⅱ alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease emphysematous phenotype via interaction with tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein epsilon,

Abstract: Emphysematous phenotype is the most important phenotypic component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The current pharmaceutical treatments and therapeutic procedures do not reduce pulmonary damage in patients with emphysematous phenotype. Therefore, it is important to identify effector molecules that can be used as interfering targets in such patients. Apoptosis of type II alveolar epithelial cells plays a key role in the phenotypic formation. This study aimed to further explore the molecular mechanisms involved in this process. The number of type II alveolar epithelial cells was significantly reduced due to increased apoptosis in patients with emphysematous phenotype compared to those with non-emphysematous phenotype. Pleckstrin homology like domain, family A, member 1 (PHLDA1) was mainly distributed in type II alveolar epithelial cells in both groups but was markedly reduced in patients with emphysematous phenotype. Overexpression of PHLDA1 prevented cigarette smoke extract-stimulated apoptosis of type II alveolar epithelial cells, whereas its knockdown worsened the apoptosis. PHLDA1 binding ability to tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein epsilon (YWHAE) was weakened after exposure to cigarette smoke extract, with decreased PHLDA1 level lowering the abundance of YWHAE and attenuating the binding ability of YWHAE to p-Bad. These results demonstrate that considerable apoptosis of type II alveolar epithelial cells occurs in patients with emphysematous phenotype, and PHLDA1 may act as an effective antiapoptotic factor via YWHAE. Moreover, PHLDA1 may serve as a potential interfering target, providing insights into therapeutic strategies for emphysematous phenotype.

Abstract: A deposition strategy is demonstrated for fabricating perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under ambient laboratory conditions. A nitrogen-flow treatment followed by a short (3 min), low-temperature (135 °C) anneal enables control of the nucleation and crystal growth of slot-die coated perovskite layers without the need for an anti-solvent for devices. PSCs using either glass or poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates were prepared with an n-i-p device architecture and comprised a perovskite layer containing formamidinium and cesium cations, with or without the additive of 2-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl)-ethylammonium iodide (FEAI). The perovskite layer in glass-based devices was slot-die coated onto a stationary substrate with a moving coating head, whereas the deposition of the perovskite layer in PET-based devices was achieved by slot-die coating onto a moving (roll-to-roll, R2R) web using a stationary coating head. The processing conditions enabled the fabrication of PSCs displaying excellent temperature and humidity tolerance (up to 50% relative humidity). Devices fabricated on the glass substrates had power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of more than 18%, with PCEs of more than 15% measured for cells on the PET film substrates. The use of the FEAI additive improved the environmental stability of encapsulated glass-based PSC devices, which retained up to 70% of their initial PCE after 1000 h at maximum power point under 1-sun illumination in air. The scalability of the fabrication techniques used in this work, along with the low annealing temperature and ability to process in an ambient laboratory environment, makes this a promising approach for translation to industrial-scale R2R production processes.

Abstract: Highly paraffin/butyl stearate-loaded phase change microcapsules were synthesized by cosolvent-free interfacial polymerization using low-toxicity dicyclohexylmethane-4, 4′-diisocyanate as the shell material. The formation of the microcapsules and their distribution in the epoxy were studied by means of optical microscope and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The chemical composition of microcapsules was confirmed through Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. And the phase change properties, thermal stability and cyclic thermal stability of microcapsules and their thermal insulation properties and thermal response behavior in the epoxy were investigated through differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, leakage prevention test, thermal conductivity test and temperature response experiment, respectively. The synthesized spherical microcapsules have distinct core-shell structure with an average diameter of 220.6 μm. The microcapsules achieve an encapsulation rate of 78.5%, with the melting enthalpy and the crystallization enthalpy being 148.5 J/g and 159.2 J/g, respectively. They not only exhibit good thermal stability and cyclic thermal stability, but also can disperse in the epoxy uniformly and combine with the epoxy tightly. In addition, compared with the pure epoxy, the epoxy containing 15 wt% microcapsules experiences a 10.1% decreases in thermal conductivity and a 55.4% increase in delayed time of temperature rise/fall, showing an excellent temperature regulation ability.

Abstract: In the present study, n-MoS2/p-Si and n-MoS2/AlN/p-Si Semiconductor-Insulator-Semiconductor (SIS) heterojunctions based photodetectors have been fabricated using dc magnetron sputtering technique. The recorded value of responsivities for both n-MoS2/p-Si and n-MoS2/AlN/p-Si heterojunctions are found to be 0.3378 AW-1 and 1.865 AW-1 for visible radiations (532 nm) and 0.1245 AW-1 and 1.4743 AW-1 for NIR radiations (1064 nm), respectively. The response time (rise time and decay time) of the fabricated heterojunction decreased from 47.30 μs and 56.58 μs to 3.32 μs and 4.73 μs with the insertion of an ultrathin insulating AlN layer. The higher current flows in SIS heterojunction can be ascribed to the carrier tunneling mechanism through the ultrathin insulating layer. Moreover, the thickness effect of the insulating layer on the photodetection performance of the fabricated heterostructure has been investigated. The obtained results demonstrate that SIS heterojunctions with an excellent carrier transport mechanism are proved to be potential candidates in next-generation ultrafast optoelectronics applications.

Abstract: In the field of silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells, great successes on improving production processes have been achieved in the last years, however further improvements in the case of metallization are required to obtain higher market share. Therefore, lower Ag laydowns and higher process throughput are demanded. This study presents the impact of filament stretching on Ag-electrode shapes and laydown during temperature-controlled micro-extrusion, known as parallel dispensing. Dispensed metal grids ensure higher cell performances than screen-printed grids. It has been discovered that the maximum use of filament stretching benefits the solar cell efficiency due to narrower Ag-electrodes and less silver consumption. We have shown a low Ag laydown per 157.35 mm line of mAg = 0.27 mg electrode-1 in average. An efficiency gain of ΔηA = + 0.26%abs. has been demonstrated by the maximum usage of filament stretching. Further, a novel parameter that values the effectiveness of silver usage and enables the comparison between different printing processes has been introduced. We have demonstrated that silver is used more effectively by up to +74%rel. when the low-temperature curing paste is dispensed compared to screen printing because dispensed electrodes show an almost perfectly homogeneous shape.

Abstract: Decidualization is essential for a successful pregnancy and determines embryo implantation and pregnancy maintenance. Abnormal decidualization is one of the main causes of recurrent implantation failure (RIF). Studies have shown that large amounts of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abnormally expressed in endometrial samples from patients with RIF. However, the functional contributions of lncRNAs to decidualization in RIF have not been explored. In this study, we found that lncSAMD11–1:1 was significantly declined in the endometria of patients with RIF. The knockdown of lncSAMD11–1:1 in human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) restrained decidualization and embryo implantation in vitro, while the overexpression of lncSAMD11–1:1 facilitated hESC decidualization and embryo implantation in vitro and ameliorated decidualization in RIF patients. Mechanistically, lncSAMD11–1:1 and phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 alpha (PIP4K2A) translocated out of nucleus and bound to each other during decidualization, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT and promoting FoxO1 nuclear localization. These data suggest that lncSAMD11–1:1 might be a critical novel lncRNA functionally required for human decidualization, and the dysregulation of lncSAMD11–1:1 in the endometrium may be a new predisposing factor of RIF.

Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ranks highly among malignant tumors in the world in terms of morbidity and mortality. By using bioinformatics, we screened and obtained a novel oncogene WDR43, a member of the WD-repeat protein encoding family that is closely related to tumor progression. PCR and immunohistochemistry showed that WDR43 is highly expressed in NSCLC. High WDR43 expression in NSCLC was associated with worse clinical symptoms and prognosis. Knocked down expression of WDR43 significantly impaired the migration and proliferation and cell-cycle arrest in G1 phase in NSCLC cell lines. WDR43 can directly interact with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and induce the expression of cyclin proteins. Our results suggest that WDR43 is a promising target of protein–protein interaction inhibitors for treatment of NSCLC.

Abstract: Mechanical, thermal, and chemical treatments were employed on a discarded small-sized silicon solar module to recover valuable materials from it. Materials like glass, junction box, polymer back sheet, and aluminium frame were recovered without damage. Ethylene-vinyl acetate layer (EVA) was obtained through the treatment of the panel with toluene solution. Optimised solution of 2 M HCl was used for Pb and Sn stripping from connecting wires to recover Cu Strips. Pb was extracted as PbCl2 from the solution through precipitation in an ice bath. Sn was recovered as SnO2 and SnCl2 through electrolysis of the residual solution. Al from the back contact was recovered as Al(OH)3 through sequential treatment with KOH and H2SO4. The effect of the molar concentration of KOH solution on Al etching was also investigated, and it was found that the 2 M solution was optimal. An innovative and cost-effective approach was adopted for the recovery of silver. Ag extraction involved, the treatment of solar cell pieces with HNO3 acid followed by reduction of AgNO3 with the copper strips. As recovered Cu strips were reused for Ag recovery, it can be considered a cost-reducing step for the reported recycling process. At last, ARC coating was removed by employing an H3PO4 solution to get silicon wafer pieces. X-Ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) were used for phase identification and purity of the recovered materials. An overall recovery rate of 92.4% is achieved. Environmental impact and revenue generation through the process is also discussed.

Abstract: Metallic foams, especially copper foams (CF), have been investigated to solve the problems of leaking and low thermal conductivity of phase change materials (PCMs), which helps to promote the application in solar thermal energy storage and thermal management. In this paper, the surface and pore structure of commercial CF was modified by in-situ formed copper nanowires and the introduction of flake graphite (FG). The copper nanowires and embedded FG not only provide greater capillary absorption force to prevent the leakage of liquid paraffin but also enhance the thermally conductive and photothermal conversion efficiency of the phase change composites. The thermal conductivity of the modified CF supported composite PCM reaches 4.1 W m−1 k−1, which is 1.6 times of the un-modified CF supported composite PCM and 20.5 times of paraffin. These results indicate the great application prospects in the fields of solar thermal energy storage and thermal management.

Abstract: As the components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are inextricably linked to cancer development. However, the potential impact of CAFs on gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear, as does the relationship between clinical prognosis and immunotherapy. We identified the expression of genes associated with CAFs in 1050 gastric cancer samples from three independent datasets and assessed the correlation between CAFs and clinical characteristics, prognosis, and TME. The CRG-Score was developed and validated for predicting overall survival (OS) in gastric cancer patients and its applicability in immunotherapy. We explored the changes of CAFs-related genes (CRGs) in gastric cancer tissues and evaluated their expression patterns. Two molecular subtypes were identified, and the expression of CRGs was assessed among different subtypes in correlation with prognosis and TME characteristics. The CRG-Score was constructed using differentially expressed genes between the subtypes, and its predictive power was evaluated in gastric cancer patients. Additionally, we developed an accurate nomogram to increase the clinical practicality of CRG-Score. Furthermore, CRG-Score was significantly correlated with tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, cancer stem cells, and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity. CRGs have the potential to influence prognosis, TME, and the clinical features of gastric cancer. This provided new possibilities for improving our understanding of gastric cancer, assessing prognosis, and more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.

Abstract: The photocarrier dynamics in polycrystalline CdTe films is closely related to device performance. However, the test results obtained at different illumination intensity may be different, and even significantly deviate from the ones in practical application environments. Here, the photocarrier dynamics in polycrystalline CdTe films deposited by thermal evaporation was studied through time-resolved transient absorption (TA) under different pump intensity. It was found that the behavior of photocarriers in CdTe films is strongly dependent on the pump intensity. Under low pump intensity close to operating environment of solar cells, the lifetime of free carriers becomes extremely short compared to high intensity, which is interpreted as a rapid trapping of free carriers by defects. For low pump intensity, numerical fitting by a physical model with one defect level shows that the free carriers in band-edge can be rapidly trapped by defects within tens of picoseconds and then slowly recover to the ground state within several nanoseconds. These results provide a meaningful reference to understand the photocarrier dynamics of CdTe polycrystalline films with a low excess carrier concentration close to that under AM1.5G illumination.

Abstract: Sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) with a working temperature of about 58 °C is a significant working medium in thermal energy storage and solar energy utilization. However, supercooling effect inevitably hinders its heat release in practical applications. Typically, nucleating agents can effectively eliminate the supercooling of SAT. A concomitant problem is that the nucleating agent addition reduces the thermal energy storage capacity. In this work, a state-of-the-art methodology is constructed to eliminate the supercooling and preserve the thermal energy storage capacity of SAT synchronously by utilizing the sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate (SDPD) as a novel nucleating agent. The supercooling of SAT can be reduced from 34.8 °C to 0 °C when increasing the SDPD content from 0% to 1.2%. The corresponding latent heat is slightly increased from 227.30 Jg-1 to 248.77 Jg-1. Thermal conductivity is maintained at a relatively high level of 0.6 Wm−1K−1. Polypyrrole (PPY) with strong solar absorption is assembled with the SAT/SDPD composites to realize the solar energy harvesting. Taking the advantages of the functional components, the proposed SAT/SDPD/PPY device is applied in personal thermal management and the thermoelectric power generation to produce thermal comfort and clean electric energy by the solar-thermal conversion, thermal energy storage and thermal energy utilization. This work provides a new strategy for manufacturing advanced inorganic PCMs and paves the way for the application of inorganic PCMs toward solar energy utilization.

Abstract: The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoTs) demands self-powered indoor devices to supply continuous power. Thus, developing an efficient photo-storage device that is capable of harvesting and storing indoor light energy requires detailed performance analysis of suitable solar cells. Herein, a comparative study of the performance of photo-storage systems based on three different solar cell technologies in combination with symmetric non-volatile supercapacitors was performed. Considering the advantages of hybrid solar cells such as low-cost fabrication and high photovoltaic response under diffused light, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) were selected, and the photo-storage efficiencies were compared with crystalline silicon solar cells (crystalline Si–SCs) under outdoor (Xe light irradiation: 1–100 mW cm−2) and indoor white Light Emitting Diode (LED) (1–20 mW cm−2) illumination. Photovoltaic performance was compared using current-voltage (IV), maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and charging of supercapacitor, either directly or through a DC-DC converter. The highest efficiencies were observed with PSCs under low light intensity, using Xe light and white LED light conditions. Despite the anomalous hysteresis behavior, IV analysis of the PSCs showed efficiency above 12% under Xe light irradiation and above 20% using white LED lighting (extracted from the reverse scan and at light intensity intervals of 1–20 mW cm−2). The determination of real-time efficiencies at MPP for PSCs showed a temporary efficiency drop at each intensity under white LED light, which is more significant for longer illumination times. However, under low light-intensity, single PSCs showed only a slight average voltage drop of 800 to 700 mV in comparison with a considerable drop of 800 to 500 mV at MPP for two series-connected crystalline Si–SCs. In addition, single PSC was able to show better power delivery efficiencies (PDEs) and supply the required minimum operating voltage for the DC-DC boost converter at 1–20 mW cm−2 where two series solar cells are required for DSCs and crystalline Si–SCs. The overall efficiencies for the DC-DC boost converter charging dropped towards low intensities from 9 to 5% and 8.5 to 2.7% for PSCs and crystalline Si–SCs, respectively. This decrease was mainly due to the loss of converter efficiency at low input powers which could be negligible on large-scale solar cells. Furthermore, in direct charging, PSC provided over 8.5% stable overall efficiencies with about 80% storage efficiency under white LED light intensities ranging from 1 to 20 mW cm−2 at the areal discharge, and were able to maintain high overall peak efficiencies of 5.6 and 4.1% at high areal discharging currents of 18 and 30 mA cm−2, respectively. This study demonstrates the suitability of photo-supercapacitor systems combining PSCs and carbon-based supercapacitors for continuous power-up of indoor high-current-requirement IoT devices.

Abstract: Electroplated copper electrodes are manufactured for the first time on 22.5 cm2 two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. This study demonstrates that a 10 nm thin atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al2O3 masking layer on ITO enables the tandem cells to withstand the chemistry of the wet chemical metallization process. Our approach uses a screen-printed Ag seed-layer on ITO for homogeneous electroplating current distribution and a photoconversion efficiency up to ≈ 15% is reached. To avoid the use of any metal seed-layer on ITO, we also demonstrate a light-induced Cu plating (LIP) process. This further validates the presence of an electrical contact between the Cu electrode and both perovskite and Si cells. Finally, progress with the transfer of the native oxide barrier layer for selective electroplating (NOBLE) metallization to bifacial perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is presented.

Abstract: Light exposure is widely known to enhance the performance of amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction (HJT) solar cells and modules. Recently, in an attempt to integrate such effect during cell production, processes involving intense illumination densities were reported. In this work, we develop a fast post-treatment on solar cells from Enel Green Power (EGP), using a LED-based tool specifically designed for HJT cells by Applied Materials and CEA. We investigate key aspects that such post-treatments should fulfil to be a relevant option in industry, including the amplitude of the gain, its stability under extended dark storage, its transferability to the module, and the influence of the post-treatment on the module reliability. Eventually, we also assess other potential side-benefits of the developed post-treatment, such as its influence on the efficiency distribution and on the yield of a fabrication line, as well as its robustness with respect to typical cell evolutions.

Abstract: Among lead-free halide double perovskites, Cs2AgBiBr6 is a potential alternative to substitute toxic and unstable organic-inorganic lead-based halide perovskites. However, the film forming ability and wide indirect bandgap have impeded its applications. Herein, we investigate to use MoS2 nanoflakes as a hole transport interlayer to improve the crystallinity of Cs2AgBiBr6, tailor energy level alignments and enhance the stability of solar cells. With the addition of the MoS2 nanoflakes, the Cs2AgBiBr6-based solar cell has a power conversion efficiency of 4.17% with an open circuit voltage of 1.10 V and short-circuit current of 6.12 mA cm−2. This work would provide a new approach for developing all inorganic lead-free Cs2AgBiBr6-based solar cells with high power conversion efficiency and good stability.

Abstract: N-type nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H(n)) layers are good candidates to improve current and transport properties in heterojunction solar cells. In this work, we perform thickness series alongside PH3 doping series to unravel the desirable characteristics of nc-Si:H(n) along its growth direction. While increasing the PH3 flow is necessary to improve the conductivity of the layer, we observe that too high flows lead to an amorphization of the first 10–15nm of the layers. In consequence, either high crystallinity are reached at intermediate PH3 flow, resulting in high doping at the n/TCO interface but a poorly doped nucleation zone, or the material becomes more amorphous at very high PH3 flow, allowing a higher doping in the nucleation zone but a less efficient screening of the barrier with the TCO due to the lower crystallinity. To overcome this trade-off, we integrate a 2.5nm a-Si:H(n) layer underneath the nc-Si:H(n) layer. We also report on the impact of higher ITO doping as well as on the beneficial effect of an additional SiOx capping not only to form a double anti-reflective coating (DARC), but also to improve contact properties. We observe that each of those three features can improve passivation and selectivity as well as reduce strongly the front contact resistivity (ρc). Our best results are achieved by using a thin a-Si:H(n)/nc-Si:H(n) stack together with an IZrO/SiOx DARC, enabling front ρc lower than 15mΩcm2 and an efficiency of 23.7% on screen-printed 2×2 cm2 solar cells.

Abstract: Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that are mainly present in resident and infiltrating immune cells in the central nervous system. Inflammasomes function as intracellular sensors of immunometabolic stress, infection and changes in the local microenvironment. Inflammasome assembly in response to these ‘danger signals’, triggers recruitment and cluster-dependent activation of caspase-1 and the subsequent proteolytic activation of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β and interleukin-18. This is typically followed by a form of inflammatory cell death through pyroptosis. Since the discovery of inflammasomes in 2002, they have come to be recognized as central regulators of acute and chronic inflammation, a hallmark of progressive neurological diseases. Indeed, over the last decade, extensive inflammasome activation has been found at the sites of neuropathology in all progressive neurodegenerative diseases. Disease-specific misfolded protein aggregates which accumulate in neurodegenerative diseases, such as alpha synuclein or beta amyloid, have been found to be important triggers of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the central nervous system. Together, these discoveries have transformed our understanding of how chronic inflammation is triggered and sustained in the central nervous system, and how it can contribute to neuronal death and disease progression in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Therapeutic strategies around inhibition of NLRP3 activation in the central nervous system are already being evaluated to determine their effectiveness to slow progressive neurodegeneration. This review summarizes current understanding of inflammasomes in the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases and discusses current knowledge gaps and inflammasome inhibition as a therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), as solar cell absorption layer materials, are a research focus in the field of photovoltaics. Doping is one of the important methods to modify the electronic structures and optical properties of HOIPs. Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of HOIPs has achieved 25.2% by pseudo-halide anion formate (HCOO−) substitution. Our research goal is to reveal the micromechanism of high PCE for HCOO− doped HOIP systems using first-principles calculations. Herein, we study typical structures with different HCOO− configurations. All of them have band gaps in the range of 1.49 eV–1.60 eV, which are suitable for application as absorber materials in solar cells. The HCOO− substitution breaks the inversion symmetry, resulting in the huge Rashba splitting of the band edges. The absorption coefficients are all higher than 105 cm−1. The maximum PCE value is 32.5%. Our results reveal the mechanism of HCOO− doped HOIPs which can exhibit high PCE. These conclusions can provide theoretical guidance for the fabricating of new high-efficiency perovskites.

Abstract: Osteoporosis is a common bone disease in the elderly with high morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have shown ROS-revulsive osteoblast apoptosis to be involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. At present, a research hotspot exists on the topic of the ROS-targeted clinical treatment of osteoporosis. TC-G 1008, a potent and selective GPR39 agonist, exerts a conspicuous influence on a myriad of cellular processes, ranging from cellular redox status, to gene expression, to cell apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanism by which TC-G 1008 regulates osteoblast function under oxidative stress has not yet been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of TC-G 1008 in the rescue of ROS-induced apoptosis by upregulating peroxiredoxin (Prx1). In this study, experimental results demonstrated that TC-G 1008 could activate GPR39, which then accelerated ROS obliteration and apoptosis inhibition in osteoblasts via Prx1 upregulation through the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)–related factor 2 (Nrf2). Interestingly, being regarded as an ‘information’ molecule rather than an anti-oxidase molecule, Prx1 was shown to restrict the dissociation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/thioredoxin (Trx) under oxidative stress, which signified the activation of the ASK1 pathway, thereby resulting in the suppression of apoptosis. In summary, this study explores the double mechanism of TC-G 1008 in osteoblast apoptosis amelioration under oxidative stress through (i) ROS elimination and (ii) ASK1/Trx signal suppression, both of which contribute to increased Prx1 expression, and the results suggest that TC-G 1008 has great potential in the clinical treatment of osteoporosis.

Abstract: Owing to excellent solar reflectivity and sky window emissivity, disordered heterogenous materials, including filler-abundant matrices, paints, and coatings, as well as foam-like, fiber-stacked and composite porous structures, form a major class for efficient passive radiative cooling. Contrary to well-established empirical understanding, this work offers a generalized analytical overview of their macroscopic thermo-optical properties from the microscopic electromagnetic perspective of Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory. With the family of micro-porous poly(vinylidene-fluoride)/poly(methyl-methacrylate) blends as a representative example, procedures for tailoring mid-infrared spectral emissivity via effective permittivity are outlined. Theoretical framework and design scheme are validated by finite difference time domain simulation and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. It is shown that poly(vinylidene-fluoride) and poly(methyl-methacrylate) form a pair of complementary constitutive materials for near unity thermal emission through the atmospheric window. Optimized binary polymeric blend, prepared by spray-coating method, features a window emissivity of 98% and realizes nocturnal radiative cooling with a temperature reduction of 6.8 °C and a cooling power of 94 W/m2 in an outdoor field investigation. It can serve as a promising bifunctional material for simultaneous radiative heat dissipation and capacitive energy storage, which meets the demand for nocturnal, radiative cooling aided thermoelectricity generation and storage potential.

Abstract: Epitaxial lift-off (ELO) techniques enable the development of thin-film III–V solar cell devices that are flexible and lightweight. To this end, we report an ELO process employing an internal sacrificial stressor layer (ISSL) and a surface polymer (PMMA) stressor layer. The combined action enhances the lateral etching rate and promotes a more controllable release process. The ISSL consists of quantum well-like GaInAs heterostructures that enable an accurate control of the stress required to enhance the lateral etching of the sacrificial layer, and hence the release of the thin film. More specifically, the use of the ISSL results in about 5-fold faster etch rate of the AlAs sacrificial layer. The ISSL layers can be etched away after the lift-off. Likewise, the PMMA surface stressor, which serves also as a sacrificial intermediate transfer layer, can be easily removed. The proof-of-concept device demonstration of the enhanced ELO technique was made by fabricating single-junction GaAs solar cells. The solar cell performance was evaluated under AM1.5d illumination and by external quantum efficiency measurements. Modelling based analysis shows that although the GaAs solar cell would require improvement of the front contact, yet the novel release process was successfully validated.

Abstract: Arsenic (As) has been shown to be an effective p-type dopant for CdTe, although high performance in As-doped devices remains difficult to achieve. Arsenic is prone to self-compensation in CdTe, as evidenced by the accumulation of dopant atoms in CdTe/Cd(Se,Te) near the interface with MgxZn1-xO (MZO). In this study, we use SCAPS 1D modeling software to investigate the effect of near-interface compensation, helping elucidate loss pathways in present-day As-doped devices and informing future growth directions. We consider three possible results of As accumulation: shallow donors, deep recombination centers, and a thin layer of excess acceptor accumulation. The reduction in near-interface carrier concentration caused by shallow donors is shown to improve open-circuit voltages (Voc), whereas deep levels are detrimental to all performance parameters. The thin charge layer affects capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements by reducing the depletion width while maintaining the same carrier concentration, replicating CV behavior that has been observed in actual devices. These results illustrate the importance of monitoring dopant accumulation within 100 nm of the interface, and suggest that reducing or eliminating the As concentration in this region would be beneficial. An undoped Cd(Se,Te) layer at the interface is suggested as a possible device structure to boost performance.

Long-term thermal stability and failure mechanisms of Pyromark 2500 for high-temperature solar thermal receivers,

Abstract: Pyromark 2500 is widely used as a concentrating solar power absorber coating because of its relatively high absorptance and its ease in application onto large-scale solar thermal receiver surfaces. However, it cannot withstand many years at elevated temperatures (>700 °C), degrading significantly within the first years of operation, and eventually failing unless costly maintenance procedures are carried out. This work aims to further the understanding of the reasons for Pyromark degradation and failure. Pyromark samples deposited on Inconel 625 and stainless steel 316L were analysed after undergoing extensive isothermal aging testing at 800 and 900 °C for 3000 h. Pyromark on Inconel 625 was shown to be optically stable at 800 °C for 3000 h, retaining a high figure of merit, which includes the impact of radiative losses as well as absorption, with a value of 90.7% after this time. In contrast, at 900 °C, the solar absorptance and optical performance of the coating trended consistently downward, with mechanical failure after 1200 h. Part of the optical degradation was associated with observed changes in morphology and the formation of new phases. Spallation was identified as the main physical degradation mechanism. The analysis suggested that the coating spalled due to two main factors: a reduction in bonding strength owing to micro-defects and the formation of oxide layers; and stress caused by the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between layers. At higher temperatures, a more significant reduction in bonding strength, combined with higher thermal stresses, led to the rapid failure of the coating.

Abstract: Interface defects hinder the further development of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cell (PSC). Herein, a strategy that by using tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAH) to passivate the top surface defects of perovskite film is proposed. The testing results demonstrate that TBAH can be evenly distributed on perovskite film, effectively passivate Pb2+ defects on top surface. At the same time, the long alkyl chains in TBAH can prevent the perovskite layer from being damaged by water to a certain extent. Eventually, both the efficiency and stability of PSC are improved. The PCEs of small-size PSCs (0.09 cm2) increase from 20.0% for the reference device to 22.0% for device with TBAH treatment, and the 1 cm2 TBAH treated PSC obtains a PCE of 20.5%. What's more, after 700 h aging test in ambient air condition (65 °C, 45–50% relative humidity), the TBAH treated PSC still retains 80% of the initial PCE.

Abstract: This work presents a detailed analysis of a photothermionic-photovoltaic hybrid solar device. The electrons in this hybrid device gain energy from both the solar photons and thermophotons generated within the device, and hence the device has the potential to offer a voltage boost compared to individual photothermionic or photovoltaic devices. We show that the gap size between the photothermionic emitter and the photovoltaic collector crucially affects the device performance due to the strong dependence of the electronic and photonic coupling strengths on this gap size. We also investigate how the current matching constraint between the thermionic and photovoltaic stages can affect the hybrid solar device performance by studying different hybrid device configurations. Moreover, the hybrid devices are compared with the single photothermionic solar device with a metallic collector. Interestingly, we observe that the addition of a photovoltaic stage meant to enable the hybrid device to capture the entire terrestrial solar spectrum does not necessarily lead to higher overall conversion efficiency.

Abstract: Gasochromic switchable films are materials in which light transmittance properties are influenced by gases. In this study, Pt nanoparticle-dispersed tungsten trioxide (Pt-WO3) gasochromic switchable films were fabricated without heat treatment from a precursor solution containing oxalic acid. The fabricated films exhibited a porous structure with uniformly dispersed Pt nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy profiles confirmed the reduction of Pt ions to metallic Pt. The fabricated Pt-WO3 films changed from being colorless and transparent to blue and transparent when exposed to 4% H2–N2 gas and transformed back to the colorless transparent state when exposed to air. In particular, the coloration of this film by H2 gas was faster than decolorization by air, and its durability was confirmed for 400 switching cycles. This fabrication method does not require a high-temperature sintering process, and the films can be fabricated at room temperature, making the method applicable to substrates with low heat resistances.

Abstract: Lipid accumulation and progressive necroinflammation play pivotal roles in the development of diabetic nephropathy. C1q tumour necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP3) is an adipokine with pleiotropic functions in cell proliferation, glucose and lipid metabolism, and inflammation. However, the mechanism and involvement of CTRP3 in lipid metabolism and the necroinflammation of renal tubular cells remain unclear. Here, we report that CTRP3 expression decreased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in high glucose-stimulated HK-2 cells. We noted that the overexpression of CTRP3 or recombinant CTRP3 (rCTRP3) treatment prevented high glucose-induced lipid accumulation by inhibiting the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and increasing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and ATP-binding cassette A1. Moreover, the nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain-like receptor protein 3-mediated inflammatory response and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein-dependent necroinflammation were inhibited by CTRP3 overexpression or rCTRP3 treatment in HK-2 cells cultured in high glucose. Furthermore, lipotoxicity-induced by palmitic acid was found to be involved in necroinflammation in HK-2 cells, and CTRP3 displayed the same protective effect. CTRP3 also activated the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, whereas adenine 9-β-D-arabinofuranoside, an AMPK inhibitor, replicated the protective effects of CTRP3. Besides, using kidney biopsies from patients with diabetes, we found that decreased CTRP3 expression was accompanied by increased lipid deposition, as well as the structural and functional injury of renal tubular cells. Our findings demonstrate that CTRP3 affects lipid metabolism and necroinflammation in renal tubular cells via the AMPK signalling pathway. Thus, CTRP3 may be a potential therapeutic target in diabetic renal injury.

Abstract: Conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with redox activity can be designed for photoelectric materials application. In this paper, COF based electrochromic films were synthesized by solvothermal method in a Teflon-lined reactor, with thieno [3,2-b]thiophene-2,5-dicarbaldehyde (TTDA) as electron donor unit (D) and 2,4,6-tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TTA) as electron acceptor unit (A) (COFTT). Coal-based polyaniline (CPANI) was used as COFTT growth substrate and conductive enhancing agent to improve the photoelectric performance of COFTT. The addition of CPANI results in the morphology transformation of COFTT from nanosheet to nanofiber. Meanwhile, the impedance of COFTT is reduced and the optical contrast is improved. The color of COFTT-CPANI-1 can vary from yellow to dark orange and brown under a voltage window of −3 V–2.2 V. Stability tests show that the contrast retention rate of the electrochromic device is 90.6% after 1600 s switching. Considering the rich selectivity of COF construction units and the designability of topological structure, the development of COF-based electrochromic materials with rich colors and excellent properties has a broad prospect.

Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs) composites are of great importance for a wide range of applications in energy conversion and storage, waste heat recovery and utilization, thermal energy management in building, electronic devices cooling and heat insulation, etc. Herein, a novel strategy for the fabrication of PCM composites for solar/electro energy conversion and storage is reported. The polypyrrole (PPy) coated conjugated microporous polymers/expanded graphene (EG) carbon aerogels/HDA (PCMPECAs/HDA) composites were firstly obtained via Sonogashira–Hagihara cross-coupling reaction followed by a carbonization treatment, PPy coating and finally 1-Hexadecylamine (HDA) impregnation. The introduction of EG and PPy was to improve the porosity, thermal conductivity and photothermal performance. The resultant PCMPECAs/HDA composites exhibited excellent comprehensive performances, including relatively high thermal conductivity of up to 234.0% that of HDA, high energy storage density up to 205.10 kJ/kg, excellent shape and thermal stability and a remarkable photothermal conversion and storage efficiency of up to 93.5%, respectively. And after 300 times thermal and cooling cycles, the latent heat of PCMPECAs/HDA still remains up to 150.20 kJ/kg. Besides, the resultant composites also manifest excellent electro-thermal effect at low voltage. Due to the aforementioned advantages, PCMPECAs/HDA composites possess great potential applications in solar/electric energy conversion and storage.

Abstract: Cooling solar cells towards ambient temperature is essential for photovoltaic conversion since the elevated temperature has significant adverse consequences on the efficiency and reliability of solar cells. Here, a full-spectrum synergetic management strategy that is developed by enhancing radiative cooling of solar cells in the Mid-Infrared and selectively reducing the cell’s sub-band-gap (sub-BG) absorption in solar wavelengths, is proposed to cool solar cells. To experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, a cooling system demo is developed by integrating a spectral-selective mirror (SS-Mirror) to selective block sub-BG photons and a radiative cooler for heat radiation. A temperature drop of 7.1 °C and an open-circuit voltage enhancement of 38 mV are observed under a solar simulator with 1 sun input. Moreover, a model is applied to capture the cooling performance of the proposed idea of solar cell cooling under various conditions, including for concentration photovoltaic cases. This study proposes a full-spectrum synergetic management method to passively cool solar cells and makes an experimental validation, providing a new pathway to cool solar cells.

Abstract: Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) represent a protein family firmly involved in many signaling cascades, regulating a vast spectrum of stimulated cellular processes. Studies have shown that alternatively spliced isoforms of MAPKs play a crucial role in determining the desired cell fate in response to specific stimulations. Although the implication of most MAPKs transcript variants in the MAPK signaling cascades has been clarified, the transcriptional profile of a pivotal member, MAPK1, has not been investigated for the existence of additional isoforms. In the current study we developed and implemented targeted long-read and short-read sequencing approaches to identify novel MAPK1 splice variants. The combination of nanopore sequencing and NGS enabled the implementation of a long-read polishing pipeline using error-rate correction algorithms, which empowered the high accuracy of the results and increased the sequencing efficiency. The utilized multiplexing option in the nanopore sequencing approach allowed not only the identification of novel MAPK1 mRNAs, but also elucidated their expression profile in multiple human malignancies and non-cancerous cell lines. Our study highlights for the first time the existence of ten previously undescribed MAPK1 mRNAs (MAPK1 v.3 – v.12) and evaluates their relative expression levels in comparison to the main MAPK1 v.1. The optimization and employment of qPCR assays revealed that MAPK1 v.3 – v.12 can be quantified in a wide spectrum of human cell lines with notable specificity. Finally, our findings suggest that the novel protein-coding mRNAs are highly expected to participate in the regulation of MAPK pathways, demonstrating differential localizations and functionalities.

Abstract: The operational stability of encapsulated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is imperative for commercialization. Here, we have investigated the degradation of PSCs with organic (PTAA) and inorganic (NiOx) HTLs under constant illumination and thermal stress. The device parameters under 1-sun illumination were monitored over time at different temperatures; 20–85 °C. The temperature-dependent device parameters analysis showed a lower value of degradation activation energy (EA) for the device with the PTAA (∼0.274 ± 0.05 eV) than that for the NiOx device (∼0.495 ± 0.05 eV). This result corroborates that higher activation energy for NiOx/HaP devices leads to superior device stability. The device degradation kinetic has been discussed by adopting the Arrhenius model with temperature and humidity prefactor correction associated with structural defects in the bulk and interfacial deterioration. Our analysis underscores the importance of the layer material's stability against humidity and thermal stress for the device stability correlating degradation activation energy and stress prefactor.

Abstract: Spectral controllers (SC) based on the square array of AlAs0.06Sb0.94 nanopillars (NP) and the aluminum back surface reflectors (BSR) are designed for the Ga0.84In0.16As0.14Sb0.86 TPV cells. The multiple optical resonance characteristics of the NP-BSR nanophotonic resonators are analyzed, which show the excellent light management performances. For the emitter temperature of 1000 °C, the angle-of-incidence and polarization-of-light weighted spectral efficiency of 90% is obtained by the optimized NP-BSR SC. Photovoltaic performances of the TPV cells are analyzed based on the coupled optical and electrical simulations. The results show the NP-BSRs perform substantially better than the normal quarter-wavelength anti-reflection coatings. In particular, the NP-BSRs show the strong light concentration ability and can be used to enhance the output power density of the ultra-thin film structured TPV cells. For the active layer of 0.6 μm, the output power density of over 1W.cm−2 and the conversion efficiency of nearly 30% are obtained by the NP-BSR TPV cell under the emitter temperature of 1000 °C.

Abstract: The solar photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with Z-scheme driven by the two-dimensional (2D) AuSe/SnSe heterostructure is explored. Three preferable geometrical configurations of the heterostructure are identified from nine structures stacked with the SnSe and AuSe monolayers by formation energies, and thermodynamic stability is confirmed by ab initio molecular dynamics simulation at 400 K. The projected band edges of the monolayers in the heterostructure, interlayer charge transfer, and built-in fields support the AuSe/SnSe heterostructure to drive the photocatalytic HER with the direct Z-scheme, which increases not only the overpotentials of the photocatalytic water decomposition to produce hydrogen, but also the optical absorptions. Thus, the maximum solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency could attain 32.95% if a suitable biaxial strain is applied. The effects of the interlayer distance on the geometrical structures and electronic properties are also examined, and the results show that the increase in distance is safe, but the decrease will damage the character of the vdW heterostructure. The changes of Gibbs free energies confirm that the HER with Z-scheme driven by the AuSe/SnSe heterostructure is feasible. These results could provide a theoretical guide for the development of photocatalysts for the efficient HER with the direct Z-scheme by using the AuSe/SnSe heterostructure.

Abstract: The open circuit voltage (VOC) deficit in Cd(Se,Te)-based photovoltaics remains a critical obstacle for pushing the technology closer to theoretical performance limits. Arsenic doping has become a dominant and promising route to achieve the higher p-type carrier concentrations necessary for higher VOC, but challenges associated with this alternate defect chemistry and higher doping density have hindered progress. Here we show that while arsenic doping enables high carrier concentrations (>1016 cm−3), co-doping with copper can provide a boost to VOC without a significant change to carrier concentration. A large data set is initially used to explore current-voltage and capacitance-voltage trends associated with arsenic doped devices with and without copper. A smaller subset is then used to probe these trends using a wide variety of characterization techniques. Copper is found to facilitate reduced interface recombination and potentially improved bulk absorber characteristics, though the mechanisms for these improvements are not yet clear. Despite the improved performance of co-doped devices, VOC is still far below its potential especially for highly doped devices. Low emitter doping in conjunction with high absorber doping seems to be a plausible cause for this significant deficit, though other device properties may exacerbate this problem.

Abstract: Aims
Angiogenesis plays a key role in coronary collateral circulation (CCC), the compensatory formation of new blood vessels during chronic total coronary occlusion. This study aimed to determine whether plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1), a long non-coding (lnc) RNA involved in tumor angiogenesis, plays a role in regulating angiogenesis during chronic coronary ischemia.
Main methods
Patients with coronary artery disease, and ≥ 90% stenosis, were examined and divided into “Good” and “Poor” CCC groups based on Rentrop Cohen classification. RNA samples were obtained from all patients, as well as from oxygen and glucose-deprived (OGD) HUVECs. PVT1, miR-15b-5p and AKT3 levels were measured with RT-qPCR or Western blot, while HUVEC migration and angiogenesis were detected by, respectively, wound-healing and tube formation assays. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed direct PVT1-miR-15b-5p binding.
Key findings
Increased PVT1 was found in “Good CCC” patient plasma, along with being highly expressed among OGD HUVECs; PVT1 knockdown reduced HUVEC migration, tube formation, and pro-angiogenic factor expression. Conversely, OGD HUVECs had downregulated miR-15b-5p, and miR-15b-5p overexpression significantly depressed their angiogenic capabilities. These PVT1 knockdown- or miR-15b-5p overexpression-associated reductions in angiogenic effects were reversed by AKT3 overexpression. In vivo, neovascularization and functioning in both ischemic mice hind-limbs and infarcted myocardium injected with ADV-sh-PVT1 were reduced, which were ameliorated by concurrent antagomiR-15b-5p injections.
Significance
Circulating PVT1 may serve as a useful biomarker to distinguish between good versus poor CCC, as it is involved in orchestrating angiogenesis via the miR-15b-5p–AKT3 axis; it thus has potential as a target for treating ischemic disease.

Abstract: Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3) is essential for the production of type I interferon (IFN) during virus infection; however, the mechanism underlying its regulation remains to be elucidated. Here we have identified a novel negative regulatory phosphorylation site on IRF3. In this study, we discovered that Ser82 phosphorylation on IRF3 abrogates virus-induced IFN-β activation. Furthermore, our results clarified the mechanism in which Ser82 phosphorylation on IRF3 retains the function of dimerization and nuclear import, but abolishes the promoter binding ability of IRF3. In addition, Ser82 phosphorylation on IRF3 serves as a negative feedback mechanism for the type I IFN response. These findings elucidate a previously unknown mechanism for negatively regulating IRF3 to finely tune type I IFN response.

Abstract: The CaCO3/CaO based thermochemical system has great potential in Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants. However, the CaCO3 suffers from high sintering speed, poor thermal conductivity, and weak light absorption, which is not conducive to being directly driven by solar energy. Herein, The Mn and Cr elements were doped into CaCO3 through the sol-gel method. The synergistic effect between the two elements can maintain the storage density at 1057.3 kJ/kg after 20 cycles at 800 °C. The light absorption under AM 1.5G spectrum was obviously improved to 64.5% and reached 73.3% after 20 cycles. To further improve the thermal conductivity of the composite, the tetrapod-shaped zinc oxide whiskers (TZnO) were directly mixed into the composite. The TZnO acts as the thermal conductance bridge in the composites and can retain its original morphology at high temperatures without reacting with CaCO3. When 5% mole ratio of TZnO was added to the Cr/Mn doped CaCO3, the thermal conductivity increased by 17.8%. Through the non-isothermal analysis of the reaction kinetics, it is found that the addition of TZnO can effectively accelerate the reaction, especially at a higher heating rate, which is very beneficial to direct solar-driven applications. The optimized composites showed excellent properties in light absorption, sintering resistance, thermal conductivity, and reaction kinetics, which can guide the direct photothermal utilization of CaCO3.

Abstract: In this work, the use of a novel, large area, mask-less and contact-less patterning technique is demonstrated for the first time, showing the localized deposition of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in a desired pattern over the full surface of an M0 (156 mm × 156 mm) solar wafer. The patterning functionality is achieved through a custom-designed RF electrode possessing a series of “slits” and placed in close proximity to the substrate in a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) chamber. Under a certain set of process conditions, a plasma only ignites within these slits, and the localized plasma results in localized patterned deposition of a-Si:H with feature widths compatible with application in an interdigitated back contact (IBC) solar cell design (760 μm). The homogeneity of the finger width and thickness over the surface of the M0 wafer is evaluated, with a 37% variation in thickness (at very high deposition rate, ∼1 nm/s) but only a 4.7% variation in finger width (MSE). With this application in mind, the impact of the deposition of such “fingers” on an underlying “blanket” passivation layer is assessed. Passivation is maintained or improved up to a given finger/blanket thickness ratio, above which the passivation is degraded. It is shown that the acceptable process window contains suitable thickness values for heterojunction (HJT) IBC solar cells, and the physical processes at the origin of this phenomenological observation are discussed.

Abstract: Recently, the parameterisation of Auger recombination in c-Si has been revised by two separate studies, both of which reached very similar conclusions. A key change is that the ratio of the Auger coefficients for n- and p-type Si (Cn/Cp) has been found to be significantly lower than previously accepted. In this work, we explore the implications of these findings for c-Si solar cells. In particular, we seek to answer the question of whether any intrinsic advantage is expected for n-type vs p-type doping for c-Si solar cells in general, or for particular device architectures. We focus on simple analytical parameters and models in order to elucidate the relevant physical mechanisms, making use of more complex numerical modelling to complement these and validate our conclusions. A key conclusion is that the new models predict improved intrinsic performance potential for n-type devices, with p-type Si retaining an intrinsic advantage only when surface recombination and transport losses are very close to zero. n-type quickly becomes more efficient when non-zero surface recombination is introduced, and widens its advantage with increasing surface saturation current density J0. In particular, n-type back-junction devices show higher efficiency potential and less sensitivity to bulk resistivity variation than p-type equivalents, thanks to lower lateral transport losses for majority carriers in the Si bulk. Meanwhile, an analysis of the intrinsic performance potential of highly doped n- and p-type Si reveals no significant intrinsic advantage for either type as transport layers.

Abstract: We introduce a novel simulation tool capable of calculating the energy yield of a PV system based on its fundamental material properties and using self-consistent models. Thus, our simulation model can operate without measurements of a PV device. It combines wave and ray optics and a dedicated semiconductor simulation to model the optoelectronic PV device properties resulting in the IV-curve. The system surroundings are described via spectrally resolved ray tracing resulting in a cell resolved irradiance distribution, and via the fluid dynamics-based thermal model, in the individual cell temperatures. A lumped-element model is used to calculate the IV-curves of each solar cell for every hour of the year. These are combined factoring in the interconnection to obtain the PV module IV-curves, which connect to the inverter for calculating the AC energy yield. In our case study, we compare two types of 2 terminal perovskite/silicon tandem modules with STC PV module efficiencies of 27.7% and 28.6% with a reference c-Si module with STC PV module efficiency of 20.9%. In four different climates, we show that tandem PV modules operate at 1–1.9 °C lower yearly irradiance weighted average temperatures compared to c-Si. We find that the effect of current mismatch is significantly overestimated in pure optical studies, as they do not account for fill factor gains. The specific yields in kWh/kWp of the tandem PV systems are between −2.7% and +0.4% compared to the reference c-Si system in all four simulated climates. Thus, we find that the lab performance of the simulated tandem PV system translates from the laboratory to outdoors comparable to c-Si systems.

Abstract: Passivating contacts based on polycrystalline silicon on an interfacial oxide (poly-Si/SiOx) require a fine-tuned in-diffused dopant profile at the surface of the crystalline silicon wafer. In particular, a strong dopant in-diffusion causes excessive recombination. This study contributes to reveal the yet unclear mechanism of this degradation of passivation. Boron in-diffusion from co-sputtered (p) poly-Si layers through the interfacial oxide is investigated for several layer thicknesses and plateau temperatures during the solid phase crystallization. It is shown that for higher temperatures and unexpectedly also for thicker layers the observed recombination current density increases up to a total loss of passivation, accompanied by a physical interfacial oxide disruption, which is not observed for intrinsic reference layers. This behavior is supported by simple numerical calculations. The recombination current densities are transferred into the actual surface recombination velocity which in turn reveals an exponential increase towards higher boron concentrations at the interface between the oxide and the crystalline Si base. It is concluded that rather dopant penetration of the interfacial oxide is responsible for the degradation of passivation than the actual boron concentration at the interface itself as reported before in literature.

Abstract: The measurement of the current-voltage (IV) characteristics is the most important step for quality control and optimization of the fabrication process in research and industrial production of crystalline silicon solar cells. We propose a methodology to determine the IV characteristics of silicon solar cells in a contactless way. We summarize the theory behind the method, describe the experimental setup and prove the validity of the concept by comparing contactless with conventionally measured IV results. We demonstrate that the differences in open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, and efficiency are smaller than 2.5 %rel for a test set consisting of four passivated emitter and rear cells (PERC cells), two tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells and a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cell. The methodology eliminates mechanical stress on the solar cells and the time required for contacting the cells, does not require broad busbars for contacting and, hence, enables to reduce the silver consumption, simplifies the measurements of shingle cells and potentially shortens the required time, avoids shading by the contact units and consumable costs for the probes, and yields additional information (reflectance spectrum, quantum efficiency) on the cells compared to conventional IV testing. The methodology might facilitate further applications in the future, e.g., contactless outdoor testing of modules, individual diagnosis of failed cells within a module, and on-the-fly IV measurements of cells.

Abstract: Porous expanded graphite (EG), a typical carbon-based porous material, is an effective encapsulating material for hydrated salts. Recently, the EG/hydrated salts composites have emerged as promising hybrid PCMs for energy storage and temperature regulation. However, the pore size effect of EG on the thermal properties of the EG/hydrated salts has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, an orthogonal analysis is carried out to investigate the pore size effect of EG on the absorption of hydrated salts, and the thermal properties as well as crystallization properties of the EG/CaCl2·6H2O composites. The mesh number is determined as the primary factor that affecting the enthalpy and crystal matching rate of the EG/CaCl2·6H2O composites. The EG with larger mesh has smaller pore size, which accounts for greater surface tension and capillary force to absorb the CaCl2·6H2O into the pores of EG. The EG/CaCl2·6H2O with lager EG mesh number exhibits larger latent heat, higher thermal conductivity, and improved crystallization behavior. The optimal EG/CaCl2·6H2O composites with EG (100 mesh, 700 W, 30 s) possesses the largest enthalpy of 167.4 J g−1 and highest thermal conductivity of 3.886 W/(m·K). The thermal conductivity of the optimum EG/CaCl2·6H2O is 6.2 times higher than that of CaCl2·6H2O. Moreover, the subcooling of CaCl2·6H2O was inhibited when it was combined with EG. The phase change gypsum board with 5 wt% optimum EG/CaCl2·6H2O composite shows remarkable temperature-delay performance and high stability after 100 thermal cycles, demonstrating great potential for using as heat storage material.

Abstract: Hole transporting layer (HTL)-free, carbon-based all-inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells have attracted great attention with suitable band gap, excellent thermal stability, low manufacturing cost and simplified procedure processes. Focusing on issues including energy level match and contact between the carbon electrode and the perovskite layer that limit the device performance, passivation strategies are widely applied on the interfaces within perovskite solar cells. Herein, the effect of synergistic passivation of ethylammonium iodide (EAI) and phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) on all-inorganic perovskite (CsPbI2Br) solar cells is studied for the first time. Results indicate that α-/δ-phase heterojunction and localized 2D/3D heterojunction formed on the CsPbI2Br film surface tend to reduce the trap density and promotes the energy level gradient arrangement. In addition, EA+ ions enter into the lattice and passivate the bulk phase defects of perovskite. As a result, the synergistic passivated devices (active area 0.0706 cm2) exhibit an increased PCE from 11.74% to 13.76% and a high fill factor (FF) of 80.32%, as well as promising long-term stability.

Abstract: We employ first principles methods based on density functional theory and beyond to study ZnxCd1-xTe, 0≤x≤1, alloys in the zinc blende (B3) crystal structure. Cluster Expansion and Monte Carlo formalisms were deployed to provide a phase diagram determining consolute temperature of 387 K at 40% Zn concentration. Opto-electronic properties are computed with the hybrid HSE06 functional for disordered ZnxCd1-xTe alloys, which were simulated using special quasi-random structures. Bowing effects in the bandgap and effective carrier masses were observed in alloying which can be attributed to local geometrical distortions as portrayed by bond length distributions. Downward bowing in the electronic bandgap will be beneficial in photovoltaic applications through increased net photocurrent. Absorption coefficients show robust absorption in ZnxCd1-xTe as indicated by substantial optical absorption throughout all Zn concentrations, aided by low reflectivity that ensures a high absorption. Presence of short-range order in Zn0.25Cd0.75Te was observed through clustering and anti-clustering among different cationic species of Zn and Cd. It has a value of 0.11 at 1000 K compared to −0.79 at 400 K. The bandgap of Zn0.25Cd0.75Te at 1000 K was found to be slightly higher, 0.05 eV, than at 400 K, consistent with the value of short-range order. Thus, short-range order and possibly composition can be used in the design and synthesis of the appropriate solar cell, thereby improving the performance in this system.

Mechanical stretch aggravates vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis and vascular remodeling by downregulating EZH2,

Abstract: Background
Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was recently found to play an important role in cardiovascular disease. However, the role of EZH2 in vascular remodeling induced by mechanical stretch is poorly understood. The aim of the present work was to investigate the role of EZH2 in regulating smooth muscle cell function through mechanical stretch assays and to explore the underlying mechanisms.
Methods
WT C57BL/6 J mice underwent sham surgery or abdominal aortic constriction. The level of EZH2 expression was determined by Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining. We demonstrated the thickness of vascular remodeling by HE staining. JASPAR was used to predict transcription factors that could affect EZH2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to substantiate the DNAprotein interactions. Promoter luciferase assays were performed to demonstrate the activity of the transcription factors.
Results
We found that in vivo, AAC significantly reduced EZH2 protein levels in the thoracic aorta. Smooth muscle-specific overexpression of EZH2 was sufficient to attenuate the AAC-induced reduction in trimethylation of Lys-27 in histone 3 and thickening of the arterial media. Administration of GSK-J4 (an inhibitor of H3K27me3 demethylase) induced the same effects. In addition, we found that mechanical stretch regulated the expression of EZH2 through the Yes-associated protein (YAP)- transcriptional factor TEA domain 1 (TEAD) pathway. TEAD1 bound directly to the promoter of EZH2, and blocking the YAP-TEAD1 interaction inhibited EZH2 downregulation due to mechanical stretch.
Conclusion
This study reveals that mechanical stretch downregulates EZH2 through the YAP-TEAD1 pathway, thereby aggravating smooth muscle cell apoptosis and vascular remodeling.

Abstract: The intensification of global warming has resulted in extremely hot weather in many parts of the world, posing a severe challenge to the health and safety of outdoor workers. Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) textiles with no energy input requirements can effectively achieve temperature management. However, few wearable radiative cooling devices have been successfully prepared. This study demonstrates a radiative cooling paper (RCP) with tunable stiffness for the thermal management of human head by using SiO2 fibers and fumed SiO2 as emitters. The as-prepared RCP exhibits high sunlight reflectivity of 0.97, and high emissivity of 0.91 in the atmospheric window. The results demonstrate that the RCP hat can prevent hair from overheating by reducing the temperature by an average of 12.9 °C compared with a white cotton hat under peak daylight conditions. Besides, the RCP exhibits outstanding integrated properties of high mechanical properties, waterproofness, and air permeability. Therefore, it is more suitable than other textiles for the manufacture of radiative cooling hats, and offers a promising solution to solve the problem of head thermal management in outdoor conditions.

Abstract: Non-aqueous phase change emulsions are very unknown and promising multifunctional fluids consisting of phase change materials dispersed in carrier fluids, both being oily phases. The oil-in-oil phase change emulsions allow the possibility of using the same medium for latent heat storage and transport under more extreme pressure and temperature conditions. In this paper, stable emulsions composed of stearic acid with a melting point of 68–71 °C dispersed in silicone oil have been developed. Stearic acid-in-silicone oil emulsion samples with different phase concentrations were evaluated by analysing their thermophysical properties, viscous and viscoelastic behaviour and microstructure. Emulsion properties below the melting point of the phase change material were greatly influenced by the concentration of the disperse phase. Thus, as the temperature lowered, a well-developed three-dimensional network of stearic acid crystalline structures interconnected with each other was formed. Furthermore, emulsion physicochemical and thermal stabilities were examined and proved under several mechanical–thermal cycles, withstanding more than 100 cycles in the calorimeter. The results indicate that stearic acid-in-silicone oil emulsions are an attractive candidate for energy storage applications with a phase change enthalpy in emulsions with the 10 wt% of phase change material of 22.32 J/g.

Abstract: In this article we investigate the observation of increased contact resistance in both PERC and TOPCon solar cells linked to hydrogen dynamics at the interface. We study the changes in series resistance (RS) as a result of applied forward and reverse bias in the temperature range from 350 °C–400 °C. In PERC cells, we use a modified geometry to isolate the root cause of the increased RS by isolating the current path through the different parts of the cell. We show that contact resistance in PERC cells occurs between the Ag contact and the n + silicon region at the front surface. We also report the first observation of increased contact resistance in industrial n-type TOPCon solar cells, likely linked to H dynamics. For both PERC and TOPCon cells, we show that the temperature of the measurement has a profound impact on the amount of contact resistance. However, the response of the two cell architectures under varied biasing conditions is not identical. TLM measurements reveal that in TOPCon cells the increased RS is caused by the Ag contact to the n + polysilicon region, which, unlike in PERC cells, corresponds to the rear surface, away from the p-n junction. Recent results have shown that severe surface-related degradation in TOPCon solar cells can be mitigated by annealing treatments at temperatures similar to those explored herein. Therefore, identifying contact resistance in TOPCon cells may have a profound impact on further studies exploring degradation mitigation pathways in TOPCon cells.

Abstract: Plated Ni/Cu/Ag contacts offer the possibility to significantly reduce silver consumption for tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells. This work demonstrates industrial bifacial TOPCon solar cells with plated Ni/Cu/Ag metallization achieving champion solar cell efficiencies of up to 24.0%. The influence of reduced poly-Si thickness down to 60 nm of the TOPCon rear side on the open circuit voltage (Voc) is analysed and the impact of laser-induced damage during laser contact opening (LCO) is characterized. Furthermore, mitigation strategies to systematic fill factor losses are developed including laser-induced nano-roughness within the LCO to increase contact adhesion and current-annealing to improve contact resistance.

Abstract: We report a reactive ion etching process based on SF6–CHF3, which can prepare black germanium at low RF power and normal temperature. The absorption of black germanium in the spectral range of 300–1750 nm is greater than 99%. Spectral selectivity optimization allows nano tapered germanium to absorb nearly 98.1% of solar radiation. This nanostructure is uniform in a large area and also supports patterning design for the application in related fields such as photothermal imaging. Here, we discuss the effect of SF6 and CHF3 plasma concentrations on the progress of chemical reactions on the germanium surface and their essential role in forming tapered nanostructures. We observe its surface plasmon resonance by finite-difference time-domain way. Finally evaluate its feasibility in devices by photothermal conversion and water droplet evaporation experiments. The proposal of this work provides an available method for semiconductor micromachining, and also provides experimental and theoretical support for the efficient thermal utilization of solar energy.

Abstract: Glass samples have been processed by a single-step self-masking RIE (Reactive Ion Etching) process to obtain random subwavelength structures (SWSs), which mimic anti-reflective and anti-soiling patterns present in nature. The SWSs fabricated on glass provide an excellent broadband omnidirectional anti-reflective (AR) property (¡1% absolute reflectance) in the spectral region (300–1200) nm due to the graded refractive index that these SWS produce in the air–glass interface, reducing the reflectance. Moreover, these SWSs increase the roughness of the glass surface enhancing its wettability and anti-soiling properties. In order to quantify the performance improvement of photovoltaic devices when using these structured glasses as front cover, commercial PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact) solar cells have been laminated with these structured glasses using the standard configuration (glass/EVA/Solar Cell/EVA/backsheet) and their electrical parameters such as I–V curve, spectral response, and IAM (Incidence Angle Modifier) factor have characterized.

Abstract: Thanks to its metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) temperature not so far from the ambient one, thermochromic VO2 exhibits great potentiality in smart coatings devoted to energy purposes. Among the different methods to synthesize thermochromic VO2 films, reactive magnetron sputtering remains one of the most suitable for cost-effective industrial-scale production. For a few decades, increasing attention has been paid to a fast and relatively simple approach based on two steps to produce thermochromic VO2 thin films: synthesis of a vanadium thin film followed by its oxidation at moderate temperatures. Recently, we have revealed that the oxidation of vanadium nitride (VN) thin films also gives rise to the formation of thermochromic VO2. This work aims to compare the thermochromic properties of VO2 films achieved after thermal air oxidation of V and VN thin films. For both precursors, short-time air annealing was performed at 550 °C. X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy depicted that the thermal oxidation domain allowing the formation of the thermochromic VO2 phase was enlarged for VN compared to V precursor films. These results were confirmed by electrical measurements. Finally, a particular focus was made on the oxides of the VN series in terms of their infrared properties. The results indicate that the oxidation of VN precursor allows the synthesis of VO2 films with high purity displaying good thermochromic performances (IR contrast of 63%, electrical switch of ∼2 decades) with narrower hysteresis widths (<9.3 °C) as compared to those from vanadium films, making VN precursor of particular interest for industrial upscaling.

Abstract: Photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) is an advanced technology that combines both the photoelectric and the thermionic effects synergistically into a single device for direct electricity generation. However, its industrial-level application is still missing partly due to the lack of advanced models to analyze its operating characteristics and to understand the synergistic mechanism. Herein, we develop a numerical model of PETE by fully considering the optical, the electrical and the thermodynamic aspects with one-dimensional steady-state continuity equations of carriers in the semiconductor cathode. A hybrid PETE-Stirling cycle system is also proposed to yield an output power density of 162.65 kW/m2 with 32.8% conversion efficiency. The PETE conversion efficiency keeps ∼20% with the optimal electron affinity increases from 0.5 to 1.14 eV as solar concentration ratio varies from 100 to 500. The cathode thickness should be optimized by considering both solar absorption and photon enhancement, where the thickness range of 0.78–1.52 μm is obtained for 50–500 suns. The interelectrode gap is also found to significantly affect the PETE performance by regulating both the space-charge effect and near-field radiation, where the range of 0.5–2 μm is recommended. This work can serve as a foundation to understand the working mechanism of PETE converters and provide guidelines for the performance evaluation.

Abstract: Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) using alloy-based phase-change materials (PCMs) is a promising technique for stabilizing the power supply of grid-connected renewable energies. In particular, recently developed alloy-based microencapsulated PCMs (MEPCMs) are attracting considerable attention owing to their ease of handling and ability to overcome the problems of corrosion and melting leakage experienced by alloy PCMs. To expand high-temperature LHTES, more MEPCMs need to be developed. In this study, an MEPCM was developed using Al-5 wt.%Ni alloy (melting point 640°C). Microencapsulation was performed in two steps: 1) Al hydroxide layer formation on the surface of PCM particles by boehmite treatment in boiling water for 1 h or 3 h and 2) Al2O3 shell formation by heat oxidation treatment in an O2 atmosphere. The prepared MEPCM consisted of an α-Al2O3 shell and an Al–Ni alloy core. The sample after 1 h of boehmite treatment and heat oxidation treatment had melting and solidification latent heat capacities of 241 J g–1 and 251 J g–1, respectively. The developed MEPCM maintained its original shape and high latent heat capacity, even after 100 cycles of melting and solidification. The developed Al–Ni alloy-based MEPCM is expected to be applied to next-generation LHTES, in which a large-scale and ultrafast heat exchange system is employed in a small space by cascade configuration with other MEPCMs with different melting points. In addition, the formation of the Al–Ni alloy core/α-Al2O3 shell structure was investigated thermodynamically, providing insights that will promote the development of Al-X alloy-based MEPCMs in the future.

Abstract: Although condensation plays an important role in photovoltaic (PV) soiling, the mechanism of interaction among the condensate, dust particle, and PV surface has not been effectively elucidated. In this work, the dynamic behavior of dust/condensate during condensation and evaporation is investigated. Further, quantitative measurements are performed after drying. In addition, the effects of surface wettability and dust types on soiling are studied. A surface with a hydrophobic coating is found to have enhanced dust rearrangement/agglomeration by reducing surface coverage and particle adhesion. However, the hydrophobicity of particles is unfavorable because of the weak water-solid force. Based on these results, an explanative mechanism for the morphology and spatial distribution of dust mass after drying according to the force analysis is proposed. Two mechanisms account for surface soiling in the presence of dew: contact status between condensate and particles and condensation mode on the surface. This finding may guide the development of suitable strategies to prevent or mitigate soiling.

Abstract: Background
Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most prevalent gynecological cancers with a 5-year survival rate of 20–60%. Feasible prognostic molecular biomarkers of EC are necessary for accurate prediction of EC prognosis.
Methods
RAC3 is a member of the Rho GTPases. Public databases including Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA2), Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), LinkedOmics, Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING), TISIDB and cBioPortal were employed to analyze the differential expression, clinicopathologic characteristics, functional networks, immune cell infiltrates and genetic alteration of RAC3 in EC patients.
Results
RAC3 expression was elevated in EC patients analyzed by TIMER and GEPIA. Overexpression of RAC3 was obviously correlated with clinical stage, histological type, histological grade and DNA hypomethylation. Patients with high RAC3 expression displayed poor overall survival. Functional enrichment analysis showed that RAC3 was involved in translational initiation, DNA replication and mRNA processing. RAC3 expression was negatively associated with infiltrating levels of B cells, CD8 + T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells in EC. Experiments in vitro showed that RAC3 was upregulated in EC tissues and cell lines, and RAC3 induced cell proliferation and invasion by increasing fatty acid synthase (FASN) expression.
Conclusion
High expression of RAC3iscorrelated with poor prognosis and low infiltration of immune cells in EC. RAC3 promotes cell proliferation and invasion via FASN. These results demonstrate thatRAC3 functions as an EC oncogene and reveal its underlying mechanism in EC progression, suggesting that RAC3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in EC.

Abstract: To offer a solution for low heat transfer and solar energy-storage performance of conventional phase-change fluids, we designed a direct absorption solar energy collecting system based on n-octadecane/phosphorene (PR) nanosheet phase-change nanofluids for capturing solar energy with high energy conversion efficiency and rapid heat response and transfer. The phase-change nanofluids were fabricated through homogenously dispersing PR nanosheets in the n-octadecane aqueous emulsion. The resultant nanofluids exhibit good dispersion stability and suitable viscosity under an optimal emulsifier content of 9.0 wt % and a homogenization rate of 16,000 rpm. Although the nanofluids show a relatively lower latent-heat capacity compared to pristine n-octadecane emulsion, their thermal response and heat transfer were enhanced significantly due to the introduction of PR nanosheets, leading to an increase in thermal conductivity by 98.59% for the nanofluids containing 1.0 wt % PR nanosheets. More importantly, the n-octadecane/PR nanosheet nanofluids exhibit an excellent optical absorption capacity for solar photothermal conversion and thermal energy storage. The nanofluid containing 1.0 wt % phosphorene nanosheets presents a relative thermal storage capacity of 152% by taking pristine n-octadecane emulsion as a control. The nanofluids also show good working stability for the long-term use in solar photothermal conversion and thermal energy storage. The phase-change nanofluids developed in this study exhibit great application potential in solar energy capture and photothermal energy utilization thanks to their enhanced thermal conductivity, high energy-storage density, suitable viscosity, thermal reliability, and excellent photothermal conversion and energy-storage capability.

Abstract: Light-induced degradation (LID) and light- and elevated-temperature induced degradation (LeTID) effects in p-type monocrystalline silicon (Si) passivated emitter and rear contact (PERC) cell structure have been extensively studied in recent years. Various advanced hydrogenation techniques were previously reported, and aimed to eliminate or at least minimize the effect of LID/LeTID on solar cell performance stability. However, there are limited reports on the long-term performance of solar modules which comprise of these treated solar cells and deployed in typical outdoor conditions. This work aims to provide quantified outdoor performance data for comparing solar modules that are comprised of either hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated reference p-PERC silicon solar cells. A total of 1150 solar modules (>82,000 p-PERC silicon solar cells) were deployed on a commercial building rooftop with identical placement and real-time performance monitoring over an extended period of 12 months under standard outdoor conditions. The results showed that effective advanced hydrogenation is achievable with process time as short as 5 s, although a longer process time of 10–15 s delivered optimal results. The advanced hydrogenation technology in this work can effectively address the LID and LeTID issues on the cell, module, and system levels, with >5% higher power generation capability on hydrogenated solar arrays as compared to the non-hydrogenated reference. Solar cell and module manufacturers strive to produce products with long-term stability, and the successful demonstration of the advanced hydrogenation technology in this work could serve this demand. A future perspective for advanced hydrogenation technologies is also presented.

Abstract: In the field of photovoltaics (PV), an important trend is to increase the aesthetic and creative design aspects of solar cells towards more attractive and customized devices for integration in for instance architecture, e.g. building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). Here we introduce the concept of “photovoltaic photographs”, defined as semi-transparent solar cells (STSC) that are treated with a light-induced process to integrate an image in the photoactive layer, allowing creative applications such as photovoltaic photographs, paintings, posters, etc. Contrary to previously reported patterning processes used in emerging photovoltaics such as inkjet printing or methods where patterned transparent foils are assembled on top of the solar cells, the approach proposed here to obtain a patterned 2D-photoactive layer, is by using a direct photo-induced patterning process based on photobleaching of chromophores. Proof-of-principle demonstrators have been realized using dye-sensitized solar cells and the obtained insights can open the way to the exploration of combining this concept with other PV technologies.

Abstract: Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) films have been synthesized using reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) in a wide range of Al contents, 0.6–14.7 at.%. The film structure and microstructure investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy evolves from nanocrystalline columnar film towards ultrafine nanocrystalline films of wurtzite ZnO structure upon increasing the Al content. Electrical properties measured by 4-point probe and Hall effect setups revealed that effective doping maybe achieved up to 3 at.% Al by using HiPIMS. Most importantly, optical transmittance and electronic structure measurements at the Al L2,3 of electron energy loss near edge structure (ELNES) contain signatures of dopant activation, and dopant segregation that may serve to investigate on the origin of electrical properties degradation and to optimize the electrical properties of AZO films.

Abstract: We report here, to the best of our knowledge, the most efficient simultaneous emissions of three continuous-wave 1064 nm solar laser beams. A fused silica aspheric lens was used to couple the concentrated solar radiation from the focal zone of a 0.4 m2 effective collection area primary parabolic mirror into three 2.5 mm diameter, 25 mm length 0.1 at.% Ce:1.1 at.% Nd:YAG laser rods within a single conical pump cavity. For 356 W incoming solar power, 16.5 W continuous-wave total multimode solar laser power was measured, corresponding to 4.64% solar-to-laser conversion efficiency, 41.25 W/m2 collection efficiency, and 7.64% slope efficiency, which are 1.24, 1.27, and 1.11 times, respectively, higher than previous records by pumping a single 4.5 mm diameter, 35 mm length 0.1 at.%Cr:1.0 at.%Nd:YAG ceramic laser rod. The three-rod Ce:Nd:YAG solar laser also provided 2.13, 2.25 and 1.50 times enhancements in solar-to-laser conversion efficiency, collection efficiency, and slope efficiency, respectively, as compared to previous records by pumping three 3.0 mm diameter, 25 mm length 1.0 at.% Nd:YAG rods within the same single conical pump cavity.

Abstract: We used a nanoparticle deposition system (NPDS) to fabricate surface roughness-dependent trimodal switchable mirrors using a non-electrochromic antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO) film with dry-deposited micro- and nano-sized ATO particles. The devices switched among transparent, mirror and black states. Reversible Ag electrodeposition onto flat ITO glass and the rough surface of the ATO film obviated the need for an electrochromic material. NPDS creates very rough films by supersonically spraying powder onto a substrate. The roughness of the micro-sized ATO film was greater than that of the nano-sized ATO film. As both films were sufficiently rough, a completely black state could be achieved by both devices (0% transmittance over the entire visible wavelength), attributable to light scattering. In contrast, the electrochemical properties of devices with the micro-sized ATO film were superior to those of devices using the nano-sized ATO film because the greater roughness increased the active surface. The charge transfer resistance of devices with the micro-sized film (38 Ω) was lower than that of devices with the nano-sized film (44 Ω). The charge capacity of devices with the micro-sized film (109.87 mC/cm2) was much higher than that of devices with the nano-sized (95.59 mC/cm2). The cyclic transmittance of the device using the micro-sized ATO film was evaluated over 500 cycles with 0% diminution for its durability. Therefore, a trimodal switchable mirror was demonstrated by controlling the surface roughness of a non-electrochromic film.

Abstract: A new experimental method for obtaining resistive-less dark current-voltage (IV) characteristic of multi-junction solar cells has been developed. The method realizes by measuring dark voltage, dark current, and additional measurements of the electroluminescence (EL) intensity of subcells. It has been shown that in the resistive-less mode (low currents), the dark voltage depends logarithmically on the product of EL intensities of subcells. Experimental definition of this dependence has made it possible to determine the relationship between the intensities and the voltage. The method has been applied to a GaInP/GaAs solar cell, in which three effects have an influence on IV characteristic: the mismatch of photocurrents generated by subcells, the nonlinear series resistance, and counter-electromotive force. It has been experimentally found that the result of the method does not depend on these effects and allows obtaining a fundamental dark resistive-less IV characteristic of multi-junction solar cells.

Abstract: Loading suitable oxidation and reduction cocatalysts on sulfide semiconductor photocatalysts for H2 and O2 production reaction still remain a great challenge. Herein, we present a simple physical mixing strategy to load reduction cocatalyst WP and oxidation cocatalyst Co3O4 co-modification ZnCdS (WP–Co/ZCS) with excellent photocatalytic water splitting activity. The co-modification of the double auxiliary catalysts can efficiently accelerate the separation of photocarriers, enhance the reaction kinetics and significantly advance the photocatalytic activity. The maximum hydrogen evolution rate of 21.44 mmol g-1 h-1 is attained over 10% WP-Co/ZCS photocatalyst, which is about 6.5 folds higher than bare ZnCdS, and a high photostability is also obtained. Meanwhile, a notable quantum efficiency of 27.6% at 420 nm and solar-hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) of 1.57% are achieved, which is significantly surpassing many reported ZnCdS-based photocatalysts. Remarkably, an efficient and stable photocatalytic overall water splitting activity are achieved with hydrogen and oxygen generation rates of 61 μmol g-1 h-1 and 32.5 μmol g-1 h-1 for 10% WP-Co/ZCS, respectively. This work provides a new idea for designing oxidation and reduction dual-catalysts on ZnCdS nanoparticles to advance photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance and achieve pure water splitting.

Abstract: The mechanical and chemical stability of the light-absorber creates a limitation of the STS applications, especially in harsh operating conditions such as high temperature or aggressive solvents environment. The current study addresses the issue by proposing a highly stable and durable light absorber based on the gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) immobilized on the mesoporous silica-covered glass fiber (MSGF). Mesoporous silica coating improves the attachment of Au NPs to the fiber surface, while simultaneously increasing specific surface area. The synthesis parameters of the mesoporous silica layer and the Au NPs were adjusted to obtain favorable morphology, resulting in a 16.7% increase in the total solar weighted absorptance. The STS system based on two-dimensional Au-MSGF achieved the highest evaporation rate of 1.22 kg·m−2·h-1 under 1 sun illumination at 20 °C and relative humidity of 40%. Furthermore, the thermal stability and durability of glass fiber allowed the application of Au-MSGF for the STS at sunlight illumination intensities as high as 50-suns without any visible or performance degradation over extended periods. The inertness of the Au-MSGF plays an important role in the solvent recovery applications of the STS system. It was found that the hydrophobic coating of the light absorber improves the performance of the STS system for non-polar solvent recovery. The results indicate a significant (over 100% as compared to the evaporation in the darkroom) evaporation rate increase of octane and decane in the STS system operating under 1 and 2 suns, making them suitable for the STS solvent recovery.

Abstract: Photochromic materials are promising for application in the smart window, but typical WO3 chromogenic ceramics suffer from slow color-switching speed and limited color saturation. Rational construction of amorphous–crystalline (a–c) heterostructure offers infinite expectations for developing WO3-based composites with a highly efficient photochromic response. Here, the controllable modulation of the WO3 crystallization for synthesizing a-WO3/c-WO3 hetero-nanoparticles is reported by modulating the ratio of acetic acid/sodium tungstate precursors via the synchronous dual-phase synthetic strategy. Owing to the hierarchical structure of crystalline WO3 self-embedded amorphous WO3, the ultraviolet sensitivity, color difference, and light comprehensive reflectance of the hetero-nanoparticles are enhanced by 4.25, 1.87, and 1.52 times, respectively, compared with pure amorphous WO3. Spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical results reveal that hetero-nanoparticles switched from yellow WO3 to the blue HxWO3 accompanied by an increased free carrier density, positively shifted energy levels, and narrower bandgap. For the improved photochromic response, it is ascribed to the concerted advantages of each component and the resultant strong a–c interface interaction, promoting water decomposition in the protons supply, charge transfer in the surface hydration layer, and proton intercalation in the ion-to-electron transducer layer. This work enriches the preparation avenue and mechanism interpretation for WO3-based photochromic nanocomposites that exhibit NIR shielding properties.
