Abstract: Summary
Light-based 3D bioprinting is an emerging technology to engineer cellular constructs toward functional tissues. However, there is still an urgent need for materials with high printing resolution and allow cell-laden printing. Here, we report a biomacromolecule additive, which can efficiently improve the photocuring resolution of commonly used bioinks, mainly by inhibiting the free radical polymerization at unexposed areas during patterned photoinitiation. Fine structures can be manufactured by digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing and the resolution can reach a 10 μm level. Besides, CSNB can increase the mechanical property of amino-containing materials. CSNB reduces cytotoxicity by avoiding the burst release of photoabsorbers and shows good biocompatibility. GelMA/CSNB bioink was used to print multicell-laden hydrogels with complex patterns and supported the proliferation of encapsulated cells. CSNB thus represents a biocompatible bioink additive that provides an easy approach to improving printing resolution and supports cell-laden printing with multiple cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Discovery and engineering of novel phase structures pave new avenues in the study of phonon-electron decoupling in thermoelectric materials, with the final aim of enhancing their figure of merit ZT. Here, we report a metastable GeTe phase that shows coexisting cubic and rhombohedral phases and enhances the ZT of GeTe-based alloys to ∼0.8 at 300 K and ∼1.3 at 373 K. This is comparable with the state-of-the-art Bi2Te3-based alloys in the low-temperature range. The ZT enhancement shows a positive correlation with an increased contribution of a special rhombohedral GeTe phase with synergetic specific interaxial angle and atomic displacement, which triggers a multiple-band convergence for enhancing carrier mobility. Moreover, quenching-induced extra phase boundaries and enhanced anharmonicity may cause extra phonon scattering that reduces the lattice thermal conductivity. This work highlights the importance of precision designing phase structures for solving the phonon-electron coupling problem in thermoelectric materials.

Abstract: The epithelium covers, protects, and actively regulates various formations and cavities of the human body. During embryonic development the assembly of the epithelium is crucial to the organoid formation, and the invasion of the epithelium is an essential step in cancer metastasis. Live cell mechanical properties and associated forces presumably play an important role in these biological processes. However, the direct measurement of cellular forces in a precise and high-throughput manner is still challenging. We studied the cellular adhesion maturation of epithelial Vero monolayers by measuring single-cell force-spectra with high-throughput fluidic force microscopy (robotic FluidFM). Vero cells were grown on gelatin-covered plates in different seeding concentrations, and cell detachment forces were recorded from the single-cell state, through clustered island formation, to their complete assembly into a sparse and then into a tight monolayer. A methodology was proposed to separate cell-substratum and cell-cell adhesion force and energy (work of adhesion) contributions based on the recorded force-distance curves. For comparison, cancerous HeLa cells were also measured in the same settings. During Vero monolayer formation, a significantly strengthening adhesive tendency was found, showing the development of cell-cell contacts. Interestingly, this type of step-by-step maturation was absent in HeLa cells. The attachment of cancerous HeLa cells to the assembled epithelial monolayers was also measured, proposing a new high-throughput method to investigate the biomechanics of cancer cell invasion. We found that HeLa cells adhere significantly stronger to the tight Vero monolayer than cells of the same origin. Moreover, the mechanical characteristics of Vero monolayers upon cancerous HeLa cell influence were recorded and analyzed. All these results provide insight into the qualitative assessment of cell-substratum and cell-cell mechanical contacts in mono- and multilayered assemblies and demonstrate the robustness and speed of the robotic FluidFM technology to reveal biomechanical properties of live cell assemblies with statistical significances.

Abstract: Summary
One of the bottleneck issues in the design of semiconductive metal-organic frameworks is the growth of high-quality single crystals large enough for device fabrication. Here, we report the synthesis and crystal growth of a millimeter-scale semiconductive metal-organic framework (MOF; UO2(SC6H4COO)2(DMF), SCU-15) and further investigate its electrical properties. The single crystal of SCU-15 shows a charge-carrier mobility-lifetime product (μτ) of 2.18 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 and presents a carrier diffusion length exceeding 70 μm under X-ray excitation, which enables a significantly enhanced photocurrent response and detection sensitivity compared with those of the pelleted polycrystalline sample. As a proof of concept, a planar 2 × 3 pixelated detector is constructed to show its potential application in X-ray imaging. This work discloses an example of a millimeter pixel detector based on semiconductive MOF crystals, heralding the opportunity to develop a new generation of radiation-detection sensors.

Abstract: Summary
Liquid lithium-battery electrolytes universally incorporate at least two solvents to balance conductivity and viscosity. Almost all continuum models treat cosolvent systems such as ethylene carbonate:ethyl-methyl carbonate (EC:EMC) as single entities whose constituents travel with identical velocities. We test this “single-solvent approximation” by subjecting LiPF6:EC:EMC blends to constant-current polarization in Hittorf experiments. A Gaussian process regression model trained on physicochemical properties quantifies changes in composition across the Hittorf cell. EC and EMC are found to migrate at noticeably different rates under applied current, demonstrating conclusively that the single-solvent approximation is violated and that polarization of salt concentration is anticorrelated with that of EC. Simulations show extreme solvent segregation near electrode/liquid interfaces: a 5% change in EC:EMC ratio, post-Hittorf polarization, implies more than a 50% change adjacent to the interface during the current pulse. Understanding how lithium-ion flux induces local cosolvent or additive imbalances suggests new approaches to electrolyte design.

Abstract: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is predominantly underlined by mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RP); however, its etiology remains unexplained in approximately 25 % of patients. We previously reported a novel heterozygous RPS7 mutation hg38 chr2:g.3,580,153G > T p.V134F in one female patient and two asymptomatic family members, in whom mild anemia and increased erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity were detected. We observed that altered erythrocyte metabolism and oxidative stress which may negatively affect the lifespan of erythrocytes distinguishes the patient from her asymptomatic family members. Pathogenicity of the RPS7 p.V134F mutation was extensively validated including molecular defects in protein translational activity and ribosomal stress activation in the cellular model of this variant.

Abstract: Summary
Giant supramolecular polyhedra are fascinating because of their large cavity, with applications in enzyme-mimetic catalysis, host-guest chemistry, and drug delivery. We report a coordination-driven, cuboctahedron-shaped, imidazolium-terpyridine-based supramolecular cage structure of about 7.3 nm diameter consisting of 12 ligands, 24 Zn2+ ions, and 60 or 72 anions. The steric hindrance effect from chains on the imidazolium group keeps it perpendicular to the central linkage, which readily undergoes endohedral or exohedral decoration in functionalization. A reversible pH-controlled ring closure and opening reaction of the imidazolium ligand leads to a supramolecular fusion process from a triangular prism to a cuboctahedron. The compounds were characterized unambiguously by NMR, ESI-TWIM-MS, gMS2, Cryo-EM, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques. Being readily modifiable through endo and exo pathways, the cages may provide a platform for the investigation of the biological mimic systems, confined nanotechnology, and confined molecular arrangements.

Abstract: Peripheral nervous system (PNS) injuries are an ongoing health care concern. While autografts and allografts are regarded as the current clinical standard for traumatic injury, there are inherent limitations that suggest alternative remedies should be considered for therapeutic purposes. In recent years, nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) have become increasingly popular as surgical repair devices, with a multitude of various natural and synthetic biomaterials offering potential to enhance the design of conduits or supplant existing technologies entirely. From a cellular perspective, it has become increasingly evident that Schwann cells (SCs), the primary glia of the PNS, are a predominant factor mediating nerve regeneration. Thus, the development of severe nerve trauma therapies requires a deep understanding of how SCs interact with their environment, and how SC microenvironmental cues may be engineered to enhance regeneration. Here we review the most recent advancements in biomaterials development and cell stimulation strategies, with a specific focus on how the microenvironment influences the behavior of SCs and can potentially lead to functional repair. We focus on microenvironmental cues that modulate SC morphology, proliferation, migration, and differentiation to alternative phenotypes. Promotion of regenerative phenotypic responses in SCs and other non-neuronal cells that can augment the regenerative capacity of multiple biomaterials is considered along with innovations and technologies for traumatic injury.

Abstract: Summary
Suitable optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites make these materials interesting semiconductors for many applications. Toxic lead can be substituted by combining monovalent and trivalent cations, such as in Cs2AgBiBr6. However, efficiencies of Cs2AgBiBr6-based photovoltaics are still modest. To elucidate the loss mechanisms, in this report, we investigate charge dynamics in Cs2AgBiBr6 films by double-pulse excitation time-resolved microwave conductivity (DPE-TRMC). By exciting the sample with two laser pulses with identical wavelengths, we found a clear photoconductance enhancement induced by the second pulse even 30 μs after the first laser pulse. Modeling the DPE-TRMC results, complemented by photoluminescence and transient absorption, we reveal the presence of deep emissive electron traps, while shallow hole trapping is responsible for the long-lived transient absorption signals. These long-lived carriers offer interesting possibilities for X-ray detectors or photocatalysis. The DPE-TRMC methodology offers unique insight into the times involved in charge trapping and depopulation in Cs2AgBiBr6.

Abstract: Summary
Polarons can serve as an ideal platform to identify few-body correlations in tackling complex many-body problems. In this work, we reveal various crystalline few-body correlations smoothly emergent from the mass-imbalanced Fermi polarons in two dimensions. A unified variational approach up to three particle-hole excitations allows us to extract the dominant dimer, trimer, or tetramer correlation in a single framework. When the fermion-impurity mass ratio is beyond certain critical value, the Fermi polaron is found to undergo a smooth crossover, instead of a sharp transition, from the polaronic to trimer and tetramer regimes as the fermion-impurity attraction is increased. The emergent trimer and tetramer correlations result in the momentum-space crystallization of particle-hole excitations featuring a stable diagonal or triangular structure, as can be directly probed through the density-density correlation of majority fermions. Our results shed light on the intriguing quantum phases in the mass-imbalanced Fermi-Fermi mixtures beyond the pairing superfluid paradigm.

Abstract: Summary
Fish scales are dermal armors with an attractive combination of resistance to puncture and flexibility. Past work has attributed this unique quality to their composition and the hierarchical stratification of their microstructure. Here, we show that the ridge lines and circuli of scales contribute to the overall damage tolerance and play a key role in the “protectoflexibility” of fish scales. Through application of optical mechanics, we show that the ridge lines channel damage along paths that reduce the effective stress intensity available for bulk fracture of the scales. Furthermore, comparison of the ridge line distribution and circuli in elasmodine scales shows that they are unique across fish species and appear to be tuned for the combined functional requirements, i.e., resistance to threats and locomotion. The importance of these features in the multifunctional requirements of scales is elucidated in detail, including their role in inspiring new approaches for advancing multifunctional structural materials.

Abstract: Summary
Ionic thermoelectric (i-TE) materials have attracted much attention due to their large ionic Seebeck coefficients, but the basic relations between the property parameters and operation performances are still open questions. We derive the ionic Seebeck coefficient, Std, and the dimensionless ionic figure of merit, ZtdT, from the view of field evolutions of temperature, voltage, and ionic concentration. Different from traditional knowledge, only ionic Eastman entropies determine Std, while ionic diffusion coefficients can only affect the speed of the voltage to reach the steady state. The figure of merit for electronic thermoelectric materials is inapplicable for i-TE materials as the voltage build-up is dominated by the temperature field evolution instead of the capacitor constant. By combining the net charge storage and dimensionless response time, the proposed ZtdT can embody the transient and average efficiencies in i-TE materials, which also opens new windows for the optimization of i-TE materials.

Abstract: Summary
Perfluoroaryl groups are a recurring motif in materials and pharmaceutical chemistry. Here, we report a method to couple perfluoroarenes and thiols to yield perfluoroaryl sulfides via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) step. The discussed synthesis strategy can be applied at ambient conditions or conducted as industrial processes with either ball mill or flow techniques. In addition, it tolerates a large variety of functional groups, thus allowing it to be used for late-stage functionalization. The nature of the proposed reaction is a nucleophilic attack of a thiol group at an electron-poor aromatic ring, which is expected to feature a stepwise mechanism involving a “Meisenheimer complex” as an intermediate. However, computational simulations predict a concerted mechanism for the process. The preference for a concerted or stepwise SNAr pathway is rationalized through a Marcus-type argument considering the relative stability of the reactant, intermediate, and product species.

Abstract: Summary
To produce fuel-cell-grade hydrogen (H2) via fossil fuel reforming processes, an efficient H2 purification method with a carbon capture unit is necessary. In this study, a sorption-enhanced water-gas shift membrane reactor (SE-WGS-MR) system combining a state-of-the-art MgO-based catalyst, carbon dioxide sorbent, and Pd/Ta membrane is developed to simultaneously capture carbon dioxide and purify H2. With the optimal sorption-enhanced configuration (SE-WGS), the carbon monoxide conversion is significantly enhanced to 86.6%, compared with 68.5% using the commercial catalyst only. Coupling of the Pd/Ta membrane with the WGS catalyst (WGS-MR) enable over 95% H2 recovery, with the production of high-purity H2. Eventually, the ensemble of the three processes (SE-WGS-MR) afford 99.99% of carbon monoxide conversion and the extraction of high-purity H2 with 99.5% recovery. This study demonstrates the potential of the single process integrating the catalytic reaction, adsorptive separation, and membrane purification for the production of H2 with ultra-high purity and recovery.

Abstract: Summary
High power density operation of redox flow batteries (RFBs) is essential for lowering system costs, but until now, only acid-based chemistries have achieved such performance, primarily due to rapid membrane proton (H+) transport. Here, we report a neutral pH RFB using the highly reducing Cr-(1,3-propylenediaminetetraacetate) (CrPDTA) complex that achieves acid-like power performance while utilizing potassium ion (K+) transport. We investigate RFB resistance components and demonstrate the high and consistent K+ conductivity of the Fumasep E-620(K) membrane. When combined with a robust bismuth electrocatalyst, this membrane enables constant voltage efficiency operation of a CrPDTA|Fe(CN)6 RFB for 200 cycles. An optimized CrPDTA|Fe(CN)6 RFB, which combines a high cell potential with a low area-specific resistance (0.46 Ω cm2), demonstrates a maximum discharge power density of 1.63 W cm−2 and an average discharge power density over 500 mW cm−2 while maintaining 80% round-trip energy efficiency cycling, which are records for non-acid-based RFBs.

Abstract: Summary
Ultrathin ionic liquid (IL) films have shown wide applications in the chemistry and materials fields. However, the structure feature and quantitative controlling mechanism of thin IL films have rarely been reported to date. Here, computational simulations combined with scanning tunnel microscope experiments are used to quantify the structure and function of the thinnest possible IL films, two-dimensional (2D) ILs, which consist of 2D ordered mono-ionic IL structures. Interestingly, the 2D ILs exhibit anomalous stepwise melting processes, involving localized rotated, out-of-plane flipped, and fully disordered states, which are different from 3D ILs. Meanwhile, a theoretical model and temperature-surface phase diagram are constructed to evaluate the critical stepwise melting behaviors. Furthermore, the 2D ILs also possess ultrahigh CO2 adsorption capabilities and structural robustness during the CO2 adsorption-desorption process. These findings are promising for the rational design of an IL-solid interface for CO2-capture-fixation chemistry and related applications.

Abstract: Summary
Aqueous rechargeable batteries based on zinc anodes are among the most promising systems to replace conventional lithium-ion batteries owing to their intrinsic safety, high ionic conductivity, and economic benefits. However, inferior reversibility of zinc anode resulting from zinc dendrites and surface side reactions limits the practical realization of zinc-ion batteries. Herein, we develop a thin but robust polymeric artificial interphase to enhance reversibility of zinc anode. The grafted maleic anhydride groups in the polymer structure restrain the detrimental reactions through selective zinc-ion penetration and homogenize ion distribution, leading to a smooth electrode surface after plating-stripping processes. Consequently, the coated zinc anode shows excellent stability with a long-term symmetric cell lifespan (>3,000 h at 3 mA·cm−2) and maintains capacity retention of 80% after 2,500 cycles, paired with a manganese oxide cathode. This study provides a facile fabrication process and accessible analysis methods to rationalize the development of high-performance zinc-ion batteries.

Abstract: Summary
Carbon-neutral liquid fuel generation is essential for decarbonizing sectors that cannot readily electrify. Recently commercialized acetogenic gas fermentation offers an alternative to conventional biofuels that circumvents efficiency limitations and land requirements, provided the requisite H2/CO feedstocks can be generated efficiently using renewable inputs. CO2 electrolysis is under development for this application but suffers from scalability challenges and impurity sensitivity. We describe an alternative that utilizes dispersed alkali carbonates as reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) catalysts to convert H2 and CO2 to an appropriate ratio of CO/CO2/H2 for acetogenic fermentation. Using a fixed-bed reactor operating at industrially relevant space velocity, we demonstrate equilibrium RWGS conversion starting at 430°C that remains stable over days, even with 50 ppm H2S. The combination of carbonate-catalyzed RWGS, water electrolysis, and gas fermentation could convert electricity to ethanol with nearly 50% energy efficiency (higher heating value), providing a compelling option for renewable liquid fuel production.

Abstract: Summary
Aqueous batteries hold promise for grid energy storage for their intrinsic safety and cost effectiveness. Suppressing water electrolysis is a prime consideration, while the round-trip efficiency is an often-overlooked issue. Here, we report an aqueous alkaline dual-ion battery with Na+ and OH− intercalating anode and cathode. Despite the oxygen-evolving cathode, the battery exhibits high Coulombic efficiency because oxygen evolution is suppressed by asymmetric anode and cathode polarization. Together with the low voltage loss, the battery yields a high round-trip efficiency of 77.7% at 1 A g−1. Other merits of this battery include moderate energy density and the use of safe, harmless, and cheap materials, manifesting a practical choice for grid energy storage. The ultra-fast intercalation reactions also endow the battery with high-rate performances comparable to supercapacitors. Moreover, this work proposes and verifies the concept of asymmetric electrode polarization, shifting the paradigm for electrode selection in aqueous batteries.
Keywords: aqueous alkaline dual-ion battery; round-trip efficiency; intercalation chemistry; voltage loss; rate capability; asymmetric electrode polariztion; OER inhibition; grid energy storage

Abstract: Summary
Thermoregulatory clothing plays an indispensable role in maintaining body thermal comfort and achieving building energy savings in response to fluctuating ambient. Existing temperature-adaptive clothing without external energy input has very limited thermoregulatory power because of the lack of simultaneous regulation of multiple heat-dissipation pathways. Here, we report thermoregulatory clothing with temperature-adaptive multimodal body-heat regulation (viz. convection, radiation, and sweat evaporation), which can automatically adapt to temperature change (15°C–35°C) within seconds by incorporating mechanically and infrared optically tailored metalized polyethylene actuators into textiles. Based on thermal manikin tests and thermo-physiological modeling, it demonstrates that the designed clothing can expand comfort zone by more than 2°C on both cold and hot sides, corresponding to about 30% building energy savings when used in indoor environment. The smart clothing can also significantly improve the comfort and performance of wearers when exposed to fluctuating or extreme environmental conditions.

Abstract: Summary
The simulation of neurotransmitter transmission in the biological nervous system holds great potential for the next generation of implantable neurological devices. Two challenges are (1) the fabrication of synaptic devices with selectivity to neurotransmitters in artificial reflex arcs and (2) the direct construction of biocompatible interfaces between biological tissues and devices to form biofeedback. Herein, we report the construction of a flexible biohybrid artificial motor biofeedback inspired by neuromuscular transmission of acetylcholine (ACh). Biocompatible interfaces are built by seeding biological cells on the gate of the organic synapse. The ACh secreted from rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells is converted by the organic synapse into electrical signals to modulate the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) to drive the soft actuator. This reflex arc enables memory consolidation on exposure to ACh, exhibiting both short-term plasticity and specificity. This method may provide a way for nerve repair and development of neural prosthetics and facilitate human-machine interfaces.

Abstract: Summary
Engineered living hydrogels that can protect cells from harsh environments have achieved preliminary successes in biomedicine and environmental remediation. However, their biocatalytic applications in pure organic solvents have not been explored. Here, living hydrogels were engineered by integrating genetically modified Escherichia coli cells into alginate hydrogels for robust biocatalysis in pure organic solvents. The biocompatible hydrogels could not only support cell growth and diminish cell escape but could also act as protective matrices to improve organic solvent tolerance, thereby prolonging catalytic activity of whole-cell biocatalysts. Moreover, the influence of hydrogel microenvironments on biocatalytic efficiency was thoroughly investigated. Importantly, the versatility of engineered living hydrogels paves the way to achieve robust biocatalytic efficiency in a variety of pure organic co-solvents. Overall, we are able to engineer living hydrogels for regio-selective synthesis in pure organic solvents, which may be particularly useful for the innovation of living hydrogels in biocatalysis.

Abstract: Summary
Anilines are major commodity chemicals used extensively in the production of pharmaceuticals, dyes, and polymers. However, the typical methods for synthesizing anilines suffer from poor environmental sustainability. Here, we report an electrocatalytic route for the production of anilines that works in aqueous solution at room temperature and pressure, where the electrons and protons required to reduce the nitrobenzene precursors are obtained from water. Excellent selectivities are obtained for a range of anilines, including species with ortho-iodides that are very challenging to obtain by other methods. Our approach relies on the use of a polyoxometalate redox mediator that shuts off the direct electro-reduction of the nitrobenzene at the electrode surface and thus prevents unproductive side reactions. Given the scale and current environmental impact of global aniline production, this electrochemical route holds promise for the development of more sustainable processes for the production of these vital chemical feedstocks.

Abstract: Summary
Acyclic axially chiral styrene analogs have attracted substantial research interest in recent years. However, the catalytic synthesis of this kind of molecule is mostly limited to the construction of chiral axes between an alkene and a six-membered ortho-substituted aromatic ring. An efficient strategy for the synthesis of chiral axes bearing an alkene and a five-membered ring is yet to be explored. Herein, we report an asymmetric allylic substitution-isomerization (AASI) for the synthesis of axially chiral vinylindoles bearing Nindole-Cvinyl axes in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. These compounds exhibit configurational stability enabled by intramolecular π … π stacking interactions, which differentiate them from axially chiral alkenes that rely on bulky substitution, hindering rotation. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that both intra- and intermolecular pathways are involved in the stereospecific isomerization process.

Abstract: Summary
Manufacturing transformation toward a net-zero carbon society demands polymeric composite materials to be reprocessable in circularity in an energy-efficient and stable manner. Recent advancements in vitrimers have bestowed crosslinked polymers like epoxies with reprocessability, opening a path for the circular manufacturing of thermosets. However, (re)processing of mechanically robust vitrimers such as epoxy vitrimers typically requires high temperatures and long processing times, which cause degradation and compromise efficient recyclability. Here, we report a simple design of dynamic polyurea/epoxy (DPE) vitrimers and their carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) with exchangeable disulfide crosslinks, which overcome such intrinsic limitations. Compared with conventional epoxy vitrimers, the DPE vitrimer exhibits 6 times faster bond rearrangement and ∼40°C lower reprocessing temperature, which enables full recovery of the mechanical strength throughout 6 reprocessing cycles, while the conventional vitrimer lost ∼63% of strength. Moreover, the CFRPs prepared with the DPE vitrimers exhibit facile multi-cycle processability and repairability by thermoformation.

Abstract: Since the onset of pandemic in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has diverged into numerous variants driven by antigenic and infectivity-oriented selection. Some variants have accumulated fitness-enhancing mutations, evaded immunity and spread despite global vaccination campaigns. The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated the greatest immunogenicity and amino acid substitution diversity owing to its importance in the interaction with human angiotensin receptor 2 (hACE2). The S protein consistently emerges as an amino acid substitution (AAS) hotspot in all six lineages, however, in Omicron this enrichment is significantly higher. This study attempts to design and validate a method of mapping S-protein substitution profile across variants to identify the conserved and AAS regions. A substitution matrix was created based on publicly available databases, and the substitution localization was illustrated on a cryo-electron microscopy generated S-protein model. Our analyses indicated that the diversity of N-terminal (NTD) and receptor-binding (RBD) domains exceeded that of any other regions but still contained extended low substitution density regions particularly considering significantly broader substitution profiles of Omicron BA.2 and BA.4/5. Finally, the substitution matrix was compared to a random sample alignment of variant sequences, revealing discrepancies. Therefore, it was suggested to improve matrix accuracy by processing a large number of S-protein sequences using an automated algorithm. Several critical immunogenic and receptor-interacting residues were identified in the conserved regions within NTD and RBD. In conclusion, the structural and topological analysis of S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants highlight distinctive amino acid substitution patterns which may be foundational in predicting future variants.

Abstract: Summary
Although significant improvements in performance have been reported for monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (PVSK/Si TSCs), the lack of simple electrical characterization methods impedes further development of monolithic TSCs. In this article, we report comprehensive electrical characterization methods that can accurately and easily analyze the sub-cells of two-terminal PVSK/Si TSCs. Using a highly efficient three-terminal PVSK/Si TSC conceived for the sub-cell analysis, fundamental electrical characterization methods, such as J-V characteristics, external quantum efficiency, impedance spectroscopy, and thermal admittance spectroscopy, are investigated to suggest a characterization platform for the sub-cell analysis of monolithic two-terminal PVSK/Si TSCs.

Abstract: Bulk production and release of glue containing secretory granules takes place in the larval salivary gland during Drosophila development in order to attach the metamorphosing animal to a dry surface. These granules undergo a maturation process to prepare glue for exocytosis, which includes homotypic fusions to increase the size of granules, vesicle acidification and ion uptake. The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone is known to be required for the first and last steps of this process: glue synthesis and secretion, respectively. Here we show that the B1 isoform of Ecdysone receptor (EcR), together with its binding partner Ultraspiracle, are also necessary for the maturation of glue granules by promoting their acidification via regulation of Vha55 expression, which encodes an essential subunit of the V-ATPase proton pump. This is antagonized by the EcR-A isoform, overexpression of which decreases EcR-B1 and Vha55 expression and glue granule acidification. Our data shed light on a previously unknown, ecdysone receptor isoform-specific regulation of glue granule maturation.

Abstract: Summary
A molecular-level understanding of phase changes in hydrogen-bonded solid-state systems is of great importance in fields spanning thermal science to medical therapeutics. Polyols have recently emerged as prime targets for deployment, given their versatility in phase-induced changes, and occupy a deep space in eutectic solvents. Here, we explore the hydrogen-bond network of neopentyl glycol (NPG) with terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, attenuated total reflection spectroscopy in the far- and mid-infrared regions augmented by electronic structure calculations. A picture emerges where vibrational spectroscopy can exquisitely probe a crystalline to amorphous solid-solid phase transition while spectroscopy in the mid-infrared region provides a molecular picture of the phase transition. These methods are then applied to understand the thermal properties and phase changes in NPG upon incorporation of bis(trifluoromethane)-sulfonimide lithium salt, to demonstrate that vibrational spectroscopy can directly probe the disruption of hydrogen-bond networks in plastic crystals.

Abstract: Summary
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can persist in wastewater for several days, has a risk of waterborne-human transmission. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased infection capacity further highlights the need to remove the virus and restrict its spread in wastewater. Here, we report a decoy microrobot created by camouflaging algae with cell membranes displaying angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for effective elimination of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. The decoy microrobots show fast self-propulsion (>85 μm/s), allowing for successful “on-the-fly” elimination of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and pseudovirus in wastewater. Moreover, relying on the robust binding between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 variants, the decoy microrobots exhibit a broad-spectrum elimination of virus with a high efficiency of 95% for the wild-type strain, 92% for the Delta variant, and 93% for the Omicron variant, respectively. Our work presents a simple and safe decoy microrobot aimed toward eliminating viruses and other environmental hazards from wastewater.

Abstract: Summary
High-performance triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are usually made of expensive, unsustainable, and non-biodegradable materials, limiting their development for wearable applications and posing environmental problems for their disposal. Here, we mitigate this challenge by reporting a highly polarizable, low-cost, and biodegradable tribopositive material, made of poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL)/ethyl cellulose (EC) biocomposite. PCL (weakly polarizable, but mechanically robust) and EC (highly polarizable, but mechanically weak) learn from each other’s strengths and complement each other’s weaknesses. The obtained PCL/EC-based TENG reached a peak power density of 157.17 mW/m2 at optimized 6 wt % EC (at 40 MΩ load, 11 N), enhanced by 46 times. Thanks to the good flexibility, high tensile mechanical property, remarkable stability, and biodegradability, TENG can be comfortably attached on the human body as a wearable motion sensor, in addition to energy harvesting applications. Our work greatly contributes to the development of environmental sustainability, which results from reduction of electronic waste generation.

Abstract: MicroRNAs are known to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, the immunological mechanism and role of microRNA9-3 (miR9-3) are unknown. This study used CRISPR/cas9 technology to knock out miR9-3 to modulate its expression level. FACS results showed that the absolute number of total B cells declined in miR9-3-deficiency in the spleen (Sp), bone marrow (BM), and lymph node (LN) to different levels compared to the wild-type. Also, the absolute numbers of Fo, T1, and T2 cells decreased both in Sp and LN. The absolute numbers of total T cells in Sp and LN declined sharply; CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed a dramatic decrease in Sp, LN, and Th (thymus) of the miR9-3− group. In BM, the cells number of immature B cells, pro-pre-B cells, pro-B cells, and pre-B cells reduced to different levels, while mature B cells were comparable to wild-type. These data illustrated that miR9-3-deficiency impaired the development of B cells in BM. Also, the development of T cells was severely impaired. In Th, the numbers of DN and DP cells were remarkably reduced in the miR9-3 mutant mice. Also, the numbers of DN-1, DN-3, and DN-4 cells decreased. The absolute number of cells in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) system such as LT-HSC (long-term HSC), ST-HSC (short-term HSC), MPP (multipotent progenitor), GMP (granulocyte-macrophage progenitor), CMP (common myeloid progenitors), MEP (megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor), and CLP (common lymphoid progenitor) all were decreased in miR9-3 deficient mice. These results showed that miR9-3 deficiency initiated the damage to the entire hematopoietic system. Moreover, the absolute number of myeloid cells in both Sp and BM decreased in mutant mice. The cells number of NK cells showed a sharp reduction in Sp whereas the change was not significant in BM. The above results suggest that miR9-3 participates in the immune regulation of B cells, T cells, and the HSC system, highlighting its regulatory roles.

Abstract: Summary
Colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) provide an appealing platform to achieve emissive many-body correlations for novel optoelectronic devices, given that they act as hosts for strong carrier Coulomb interactions and present suppressed Auger recombination. However, the demonstrated high-order excitonic emission in CQWs requires ultrafast pumping with high excitation levels and can only be spectrally resolved at the single-particle level under cryogenic conditions. Here, through systematic investigation using static power-dependent emission spectroscopy and transient carrier dynamics, we show that Cu-doped CdSe CQWs exhibit continuous-wave-pumped high-order excitonic emission at room temperature with a large binding energy of ∼64 meV. We attribute this unique behavior to dopant excitons in which the ultralong lifetime and the highly localized wavefunction facilitate the formation of many-body correlations. The spectrally resolved high-order excitonic emission generated at power levels compatible with solar irradiation and electrical injection might pave the way for novel solution-processed solid-state devices.

Abstract: Summary
Stress sensors that can recognize the location where a force is applied and propagate strain information are desirable for future integrated intelligent devices. However, developing sensors free from electromagnetic interference and complicated detector setups is challenging. Here, a self-driven optical fiber is developed and implemented as a remote stress sensor. Terbium-doped fluoride nanocrystals (Ba2LaF7: Tb3+) are precipitated in situ from a transparent glass and have notable mechanoluminescence (ML) because of designed defect traps. We propose that the encapsulated nature of the nanocrystals (NCs) within the amorphous matrix facilitates efficient energy transfer from traps to emission centers, which is critical for achieving the ML behavior. The optical waveguide effect of the as-developed transparent ML sensor facilitates capture and transmission of the signals. The explored self-driven glass ceramic fiber opens a door for detecting and recording mechanical information within integrated devices.

Abstract: Summary
Throughout the ancient Roman empire, crushed ceramics were commonly used as additives for surface mortars that were in continuous or frequent contact with freshwater. Inspired by the long-term durability of these materials and employing multi-scale correlative characterization approaches that combine electron microscopy and Raman microspectroscopy-based techniques, we demonstrate the role of these ceramics as a long-term source of reactive aluminosilicates. By mapping the spatial distribution of both pozzolanic and post-pozzolanic phases, our analyses reveal the presence of a hybrid binder consisting of cementitious hydrates and calcite at the interface between the ceramics and the surrounding matrix and provide evidence of post-pozzolanic densification and the filling of pores and cracks. The analysis of a wide range of ancient Roman structures used for the distribution and storage of freshwater demonstrates the ubiquity of ceramic additives for these applications and points to the opportunity for creating more robust modern analogs of these ancient concrete formulations.

Abstract: Summary
Solar-driven electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising route to achieve a carbon-neutral and energy-sustainable future. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinders the energy input utilization, and the added value of the product O2 is low. Here, through a combined CO2RR and selective methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), we report an efficient and unassisted solar-driven simultaneous cathodic and anodic production of formate on hydroxide-derived self-selective Cu-based electrocatalysts. Upon in situ treatments, Cu(OH)2-derived Cu (HOD-Cu) and CuO (HOD-CuO) electrocatalysts display efficient CO2RR and MOR performances at a wide potential range, respectively. The rational integration of the electrolyzer to a triple junction GaInP/GaAs/Ge photovoltaic cell could realize efficient solar-driven formate synthesis, leading to a solar-to-formate (STF) conversion efficiency of 3.63% and a production rate of 0.194 mmol h−1 cm−2. This work demonstrates a simultaneous formate generation by coupling CO2RR and MOR, providing new paths for solar-driven electrochemical synthesis.

A bowl-shaped π-conjugated molecule typically undergoes bowl-inversion motion via a planarized transition state (TS), the highest-energy state along the reaction coordinate between two minimum bowl structures. Isolation of such planarized state has been challenging. Here, we report that a platinum(II) complex of antiaromatic porphyrin, norcorrole, adopts bowl-shaped conformation in solution but can become planar in solid. In the crystalline state, the norcorrole Pt(II) complex forms triple-decker stacking structures, in which the planarized norcorrole is stabilized and sandwiched between two bowl-shaped norcorroles. The planar conformation corresponds to the TS structure in the dynamic bowl-to-bowl inversion motion of the bowl-shaped molecule. Detailed theoretical studies have revealed that the intrinsically unstable planar conformation is stabilized by the dispersion force among the substituents and enhanced Pt–Pt interactions created by the antiaromatic macrocyclic ligand.

Abstract: Summary
Predicting metal-binding sites in proteins is critical for understanding the protein’s biological function. Here, we develop an ensemble deep convolutional neural network (CNN) method for predicting metal-binding sites based on their three-dimensional (3D) structure. We build multi-channel 3D voxels based on biophysical characteristics obtained from raw atom coordinates of each protein-binding pocket. Then, we use these 3D voxels as the input of an ensemble 3D CNN model. We train and evaluate the model using a curated dataset of 3D protein structures. Our proposed model shows high performance in predicting metal-binding sites for Zn, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ca, and Na. Our approach offers a framework to use 3D spatial features to train 3D-CNN, which may be used to predict complicated metal-binding sites directly from their biophysical characteristics. The source code and webserver of the model are publicly available.

Abstract: Summary
Transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) show great potential as highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet the electrochemical conversion into oxides/hydroxides remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a built-in, electric-field-induced surface reconstruction strategy for ultra-fast self-activation of transition metal sites in self-supporting CoS2/CuS heterostructures. The activated CoS2/CuS grown on carbon cloth with oxygenated surface species displays an outstanding OER electrocatalytic activity with ultra-low overpotentials of only 136 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and 266 mV at 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. Comparative studies via synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate that the built-in electric field within heterointerfaces significantly promotes the reconstruction efficiency by decreasing the formation energy of (oxy)hydroxide species. We believe this work provides new perspectives to conceive catalysts with ultra-low overpotentials and complements the fundamental comprehension of TMCs’ self-reconstruction mechanism.

Abstract: Several factors present in the extracellular environment regulate epithelial cell adhesion and dynamics. Among them, growth factors such as EGF, upon binding to their receptors at the cell surface, get internalized and directly activate the acto-myosin machinery. In this study we present the effects of EGF on the contractility of epithelial cancer cell colonies in confined geometry of different sizes. We show that the extent to which EGF triggers contractility scales with the cluster size and thus the number of cells. Moreover, the collective contractility results in a radial distribution of traction forces, which are dependent on integrin β1 peripheral adhesions and transmitted to neighboring cells through adherens junctions. Taken together, EGF-induced contractility acts on the mechanical crosstalk and linkage between the cell-cell and cell-matrix compartments, regulating collective responses.

Abstract: Summary
Ammonia is a central vector in sustainable global growth, but the usage of fossil feedstocks and centralized Haber-Bosch synthesis conditions causes >1.4% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. While nitrogenase enzymes convert atmospheric N2 to ammonia at ambient conditions, even the most active manmade inorganic catalysts fail due to low activity and parasitic hydrogen evolution at low temperatures. Here, we show that the [RuH6] catalytic center in ternary ruthenium complex hydrides (Li4RuH6) activates N2 preferentially and avoids hydrogen over-saturation at low temperatures and near ambient pressure by delicately balancing H2 chemisorption and N2 activation. The active [RuH6] catalytic center is capable of achieving high yield at low temperatures via a shift in the rate-determining reaction intermediates and transition states, where the reaction orders in hydrogen and ammonia change dramatically. Temperature-dependent atomic-scale understanding of this unique mechanism is obtained with synchronized experimental and density functional theory investigations.

Abstract: Summary
Passive daytime cooling materials can lower global energy consumption owing to their autonomous cooling capability. Although a significant number of passive cooling materials have been developed recently, their performance characterization is still challenging. Field tests experience high variability due to uncontrollable changes in environmental conditions. Here, we design an indoor setup to characterize the performance of passive cooling materials reproducibly and independently of weather and season. Outdoor measurement conditions are approximated using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled aluminum dome, a solar simulator, and a wavelength-selective inverse sky-window filter. In contrast to outdoor measurements, the results of various reference materials show remarkable precision and repeatability. Additionally, the impact of solar light intensity and temperature on the passive cooling performance can be experimentally investigated. Our setup is a first step in the development of a standardized test method to bring accuracy, reproducibility, and comparability to the emerging field of passive cooling materials.

Abstract: Summary
Enabling lithium metal is key toward maximizing the energy density of solid-state batteries (SSBs) with a solid electrolyte (SE) as the separator. However, the formation of pores at the LiǀSE interface during stripping and short-circuiting during cathodic plating through dendrite growth hinder stable cycling at higher current density. The interface and bulk microstructure of SEs govern the dendrite growth mechanism and hence the maximum or critical current density (CCD) an SE can sustain before shorting. Herein, via the control of the grain size of Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl), we show that interface and bulk microstructure can be simultaneously tailored to significantly influence the CCD. Based on the microstructure-strength relationship, we discuss mechanical failure mechanisms in SSBs derived from correlations between focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM and electrochemical data analyses. We propose that the microstructural influence on local current density and dendrite growth is well connected to the concept of crack growth resistance, or “R curve behavior,” observed in certain materials.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroelectric polymers have recently been applied in human-connected electronics as pressure (touch)-sensing materials to develop high-performance electronic skin and tactile sensing memory. Here, we report an organic synthetic route for developing a polymer possessing both ferroelectric and electroluminescent properties from which a self-powered pliable display can be readily implemented. The synthetic route involves reversible addition-fragmentation transfer-mediated graft copolymerization of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) onto a polyfluorene (PFO) backbone, which results in a comb-like copolymer architecture composed of ferroelectric side chains (PVDFs) tethered to a light-emitting main chain (PFO). The resultant thin comb copolymer film, equipped with hardly integrable three natures (i.e., ferro- and piezoelectricity, luminescence, pliability), exhibits excellent light emission under alternating current and self-powering attributes upon mechanical deformation. This multifunctional polymer, where various properties including ferroelectricity and electroluminescence are imparted in molecular-level precision, envisions its use in a wide range of fields such as emerging self-powered interactive displays.

Abstract: Cell volume is maintained by the balance of water and solutes across the cell membrane and plays an important role in mechanics and biochemical signaling in cells. Here, we assess the relationship between cell volume, mechanical properties, and E-cadherin expression in three-dimensional cultures for ovarian cancer. To determine the effect of water transport in multi-cellular tumors, ovarian cancer spheroids were subjected to hypotonic and hypertonic shock using water and sucrose mixtures, respectively. Increased osmolality resulted in decreased nucleus volume, increased Young’s modulus, and increased tumor cell density in ovarian cancer spheroids. Next, we looked at the reversibility of mechanics and morphology after 5 min of osmotic shock and found that spheroids had a robust ability to return to their original state. Finally, we quantified the size of E-cadherin clusters at cell-cell junctions and observed a significant increase in aggregate size following 30 min of hypertonic and hypotonic osmotic shocks. Yet, these effects were not apparent after 5 min of osmotic shock, illustrating a temporal difference between E-cadherin regulation and the immediate mechanical and morphology changes. Still, the osmotically induced E-cadherin aggregates which formed at the 30-minute timepoint was reversible when spheroids were replenished with isotonic medium. Altogether, this work demonstrated an important role of osmolality in transforming mechanical, morphology, and molecular states.

Abstract: Summary
Recent advances in protein function prediction exploit graph-based deep learning approaches to correlate the structural and topological features of proteins with their molecular functions. However, proteins in vivo are not static but dynamic molecules that alter conformation for functional purposes. Here, we apply normal mode analysis to native protein conformations and augment protein graphs by connecting edges between dynamically correlated residue pairs. In the multilabel function classification task, our method demonstrates a remarkable performance gain based on this dynamics-informed representation. The proposed graph neural network, ProDAR, increases the interpretability and generalizability of residue-level annotations and robustly reflects structural nuance in proteins. We elucidate the importance of dynamic information in graph representation by comparing class activation maps for hMTH1, nitrophorin, and SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. Our model successfully learns the dynamic fingerprints of proteins and pinpoints the residues of functional impacts, with vast untapped potential for broad biotechnology and pharmaceutical applications.

Abstract: Summary
There are tremendous economic and technical benefits to shortening battery test periods through robust predictive methods. Accurate long-term forecasting of battery life enables proactive planning of battery management (e.g., cell replacements) and preemptive actions to modify operating conditions to improve safety and life. The ever-evolving landscape of battery materials and applications ensure an abiding need for early capture of aging mechanisms. Herein we report on accelerated determination of battery aging mechanisms together with prediction of future capacity loss. Sigmoidal rate expressions (SREs) are used as diagnostic and predictive engines to evaluate aging mechanisms at play. We demonstrate three methods by which SRE parameters are early assessed. Overall results indicate that for cases dominated by loss of lithium inventory we can predict end-of-test capacity loss using less than three weeks of data. In many cases, predictions are within 5%–10% relative error and to within 1%–2% absolute error of observed performance.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanical force between a virus and its host cell plays a critical role in viral infection. However, characterization of the virus-cell mechanical force at the whole-virus level remains a challenge. Herein, we develop a platform in which the virus is anchored with multivalence-controlled aptamers to achieve transfer of the virus-cell mechanical force to a DNA tension gauge tether (Virus-TGT). When the TGT is ruptured, the complex of binding module-virus-cell is detached from the substrate, accompanied by decreased host cell-substrate adhesion, thus revealing the mechanical force between whole-virus and cell. Using Virus-TGT, direct evidence about the biomechanical force between SARS-CoV-2 and the host cell is obtained. The relative mechanical force gap (<10 pN) at the cellular level between the wild-type virus to cell and a variant virus to cell is measured, suggesting a possible positive correlation between virus-cell mechanical force and infectivity. Overall, this strategy provides a new perspective to probe the SARS-CoV-2 mechanical force.

Abstract: Summary
Lu3Al5O12:Ce3+ is a promising color converter for laser diode (LD)-driven solid-state lighting due to the improved thermal stability of its luminescence compared with widely used Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ materials. However, LuAG:Ce3+ emits green light, which is a severe drawback for white lighting. Here, we report biphasic Lu3MgAl3SiO12:Ce3+ (BP-LMAS:Ce3+) transparent ceramics designed with a multiple-component strategy that exhibit red-shifted emission via the inclusion of a secondary phase (Lu/Mg)4(Al/Si)2O9. This phase, dispersed homogeneously in the BP-LMAS:Ce3+ matrix, provides scattering centers, which improve the uniformity of the emitted light. The material demonstrates a broad orange-yellow emission centered at 564 nm (450-nm excitation), with an internal quantum efficiency of 76.1% and transmittance of 76% and enhanced thermal stability. Under the excitation of 14.5 W mm−2 blue LDs, it generates white light with a high luminous flux of 5,655 lumen (lm). This demonstrates that BP-LMAS:Ce3+ transparent ceramics are promising candidates as color converters for LD-driven white lighting applications.

Abstract: Summary
The rapid elimination of volatile organic compounds and the intermediate analysis with efficient photothermal catalysis are of great significance to the environment. Oxygen vacancies (Vo) play a crucial role in structural modification and performance improvement of heterogeneous catalysts. Accordingly, here, abundant Vo sites are introduced into Co3O4/TiO2 composite via treatment under H2 and Ar flow at 200°C, and the photothermal catalytic performance of toluene is significantly improved. The molecular oxygen (O2) adsorbed by Vo is activated to form reactive oxygen species for deep oxidation of toluene. Vo generated on the unilateral side in Co3O4/TiO2 heterojunctions serves to capture electrons and break the dynamic balance of electron-hole pairs. The excited electrons are trapped by Vo, and the direct recombination of electron-hole pairs is inhibited, thus promoting the photochemical process. Moreover, the photothermal synergy effect and the relationship between Vo evolution and intermediates transformation mechanism are systematically studied.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to explore and compare routine blood features and pathological characteristics of bone marrow tissues in essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis, prefibrotic stage (prePMF) and overt fibrotic stage (overtPMF), and the correlation between common driver gene mutations and clinical manifestations of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Methods: We analyzed 259 MPN patients treated at Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 2016 to December 2020. Results: Among ET, PV, prePMF, and overtPMF, the median leukocyte counts of PV and prePMF were significantly higher than those of ET. The average hemoglobin level of overtPMF was significantly lower than that of ET, PV, and prePMF. ET and prePMF had higher platelet counts than PV and overtPMF, whereas ET had the lowest platelet distribution width. Regarding hematopoietic tissues in the bone marrow, enlarged megakaryocytes were easily found in ET, PV, and prePMF, whereas the average diameter of megakaryocytes in prePMF was smaller than in ET, and PV showed various sizes of megakaryocytes. An increased M/E ratio and dilation of sinus were seen more frequently in PMF. Additionally, JAK2-positive patients tended to have significantly higher leukocyte counts than CALR-positive patients in ET and PMF.

Abstract: Summary
RNA triple helices are commonly observed tertiary motifs that are associated with critical biological functions, including signal transduction. Because the recognition of their biological importance is relatively recent, their full range of structural properties has not yet been elucidated. The integration of solution wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, described here, provides a new way to capture the structures of major-groove RNA triplexes that evade crystallographic characterization. This method yields excellent agreement between measured and computed WAXS profiles and allows for an atomically detailed visualization of these motifs. Using correlation maps, the relationship between well-defined features in the scattering profiles and real space characteristics of RNA molecules is defined, including the subtle conformational variations in the double-stranded RNA upon the incorporation of a third strand by base triples. This readily applicable approach has the potential to provide insight into interactions that stabilize RNA tertiary structure that enables function.

Abstract: Summary
The separation of C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixture is of great importance, yet highly challenging in the petrochemical industry due to their similar physicochemical properties. While open-metal sites (OMSs) in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are known to possess high affinity toward C2H2, its selective adsorption performance regulated by the electronic state of the same OMSs remains unexplored. Here, we report a metal electronic-state manipulation approach to construct a pair of isostructural Fe-MOFs, namely LIFM-26(Fe[II]/Fe[III]) and LIFM-27(Fe[III]) with different Fe[II] or Fe[III] oxidation states on the Fe centers, which display mixed-valent Fe[II]/Fe[III] centers in the former and sole Fe[III] centers in the latter. Remarkably, LIFM-26(Fe[II]/Fe[III]) shows significantly enhanced C2H2 uptake capacity than LIFM-27(Fe[III]), attested by adsorption isotherms and IAST calculations, as well as simulated and experimental breakthrough experiments. Furthermore, in situ infrared (IR) and molecular calculations unveil that the presence of Fe[II] in LIFM-26(Fe[II]/Fe[III]) results in stronger Fe[II]–C2H2 interactions than Fe[III]–C2H2, which plays a key role in the C2H2/CO2 separation.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibition of cJun is established as a promising therapeutic approach, particularly in cancer. We recently developed the “transcription block survival” (TBS) screening platform to derive functional peptide antagonists of transcription factor activity by ablating their ability to bind to cognate DNA. Using TBS, we screened a >131,000-member peptide library to select a 63-mer peptide that bound cJun and prevented 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE) DNA binding. Iterative truncation was next combined with a systematic exploration of side-chain cyclization to derive a minimal active sequence. The resulting dual lactamized sequence was >40% smaller and retained low nM target affinity (equilibrium binding constant [KD] = 0.2 versus 9.7 nM), with 8 residues at the acidic region required for functional antagonism. However, even modest C-terminal truncation resulted in functional loss. The peptide functionally antagonizes cJun (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 13 versus 45 μM) and is considerably more stable in human serum relative to its non-lactamized counterpart and HingeW.

Abstract: Summary
Solar-driven interfacial water evaporation enables us to build flexible, extensible, and decentralized evaporators with zero carbon dioxide emission. The theoretical limit of evaporation rate is not tolerable for users with large-capacity water requirements. Here, we report how a wicking solar absorber with a columnar structure can generate a counterintuitive evaporation enhancement mechanism: both positive- and negative-temperature gradients, which we term mixed temperature gradient, are generated in the wicking material. This allows a ∼3.8 times equivalent evaporation rate compared with the theoretical limit. We demonstrate that the mixed temperature gradient is a new thermal equilibrium achieved by the combined effect of solar heating and evaporative cooling. Importantly, the sidewall height should be consistent with the capillary height dominated by imbibition and diffusion. Specifically, designing a solar absorber with a balanced water supply and demand allows a higher evaporation rate in both light and darkness.

Abstract: Summary
Preparation of construction materials on site may offer advantages in transportation and storage. However, a major limitation of on-site preparation of some materials is the need for heat and oven desiccation for adequate curing. Here, we describe a method that allows rapid curing under ambient conditions through the addition of 0.1% iron oxide nanoparticles to a carbon-negative enzymatic construction material (ECM) to make ECM-n. Specifically, we show that a low-power laser (3W at 808 nm) can cure ECM-n to an optimal mechanical strength in 12 h, which can be compared to the 14-day period needed for in situ air drying. In addition, the incorporation of nanoparticles allows rapid self-healing of large-scale flaws and that incandescent light can be used if lasers are not available. This method establishes an on-site manufacturing capability for ECM-n and other construction materials and supports thermal controllability of the local structure in low-temperature regions.

Abstract: Summary
The growth in electrified transportation has benefited from the massive worldwide research efforts used to discover and improve electrode materials and electrolytes. Nevertheless, lithium-ion batteries still suffer from a slow-charging limitation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that white light illumination of LiMn2O4 provokes faster charging, improving the kinetics of delithiation without the use of nanostructured active materials. In this work, we probe the mechanism of photo-accelerated fast charging and show that Mn d-d electronic transitions occurring under red light illumination are largely responsible for the increased charging rate. It is further demonstrated through X-ray absorption spectroscopy methods that LiMn2O4 Mn–Mn bond distances shorten after d-electron excitation. The shrinkage in the crystal volume beneficially contributes to delithiation kinetics by lowering the resistance to lithium-ion conduction. Advanced materials that can absorb light to modulate their structure may provide us with a new mechanistic pathway to pursue for increasing charge transfer rates.

Abstract: Summary
Photoinduced phase transitions in metal-organic frameworks are provoked by structural changes of photoresponsive linkers within the framework under light irradiation. These transitions are rare but fundamentally important as they can bring about light-switchability on a variety of properties of the materials. In this work, phenothiazine as a photoresponsive unit with distinctive photochemical properties is incorporated into a Zn-based metal-organic framework, PCN-401. The structural characterization of PCN-401 revealed a reversible structural transition upon light irradiation. The mechanisms behind the photoinduced phase transition are studied systematically by spectrometric methods and structural stability characterization. Our mechanistic studies successfully showcased how the phenothiazine unit in the framework undergoes structural transformation under light irradiation and how the reversible phase transition leads to the property changes. The findings have emphasized the significance of phenothiazine in photoresponsive materials and can serve as inspiration for the design and understandings of next-generation photoresponsive metal-organic materials.

Abstract: Summary
Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is helpful to improve quality of life. However, the performance of ASR degrades in the case of noisy environment, limited privacy, and speech disorders. Herein, we analyze the generation mechanism of speech and utilize dual-biological-channel for speech recognition. We also propose a dual-channel graphene-based electromyographic (EMG) and mechanical sensor (DGEMS) that can simultaneously collect two bio-signals at the same point. The EMG electrodes have better performance compared with commercial electrodes, and the mechanical sensors exhibit excellent repeatability during 10 million fatigue testing. Based on the excellent performance of EMG electrodes and mechanical sensors, 100% accuracy is achieved on digits dataset and 96.85% accuracy on a dataset containing 71 words. We also demonstrate that the DGEMS can be very resistant to noise, and the accuracy is always higher than 95%. Dual biological channels can greatly improve the performance of speech recognition in more scenarios.

Abstract: Summary
Despite great progress in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells’ device performance, their susceptibility to potential-induced degradation (PID) remains unexplored. In this study, we find that applying a voltage bias of −1,000 V to single-device perovskite/silicon tandem modules at 60°C for ∼1 day can cause a ∼50% loss in their power conversion efficiency, which raises concerns for tandem commercialization. We found no accumulation of Na+ in the perovskite or silicon photon absorbers. Consequently, no obvious shunt is observed in our silicon subcells. We also find that elements diffuse from the perovskite into the module encapsulant during PID testing. We argue that this diffusion is the main PID mechanism in our tandem modules. While applying a large positive voltage bias can partially recover this PID, introducing barriers or structures to prevent elemental diffusion out of the perovskite may be required to mitigate this degradation phenomenon.

Role of MMP3 and fibroblast-MMP14 in skin homeostasis and repair,

Abstract: Early lethality of mice with complete deletion of the matrix metalloproteinase MMP14 emphasized the proteases’ pleiotropic functions. MMP14 deletion in adult dermal fibroblasts (MMP14Sf-/-) caused collagen type I accumulation and upregulation of MMP3 expression. To identify the compensatory role of MMP3, mice were generated with MMP3 deletion in addition to MMP14 loss in fibroblasts. These double deficient mice displayed a fibrotic phenotype in skin and tendons as detected in MMP14Sf-/- mice, but no additional obvious defects were detected. However, challenging the mice with full thickness excision wounds resulted in delayed closure of early wounds in the double deficient mice compared to wildtype and MMP14 single knockout controls. Over time wounds closed and epidermal integrity was restored. Interestingly, on day seven, post-wounding myofibroblast density was lower in the wounds of all knockout than in controls, they were higher on day 14. The delayed resolution of myofibroblasts from the granulation tissue is paralleled by reduced apoptosis of these cells, although proliferation of myofibroblasts is induced in the double deficient mice. Further analysis showed comparable TGFβ1 and TGFβR1 expression among all genotypes. In addition, in vitro, fibroblasts lacking MMP3 and MMP14 retained their ability to differentiate into myofibroblasts in response to TGFβ1 treatment and mechanical stress. However, in vivo, p-Smad2 was reduced in myofibroblasts at day 5 post-wounding, in double, but most significant in single knockout, indicating their involvement in TGFβ1 activation. Thus, although MMP3 does not compensate for the lack of fibroblast-MMP14 in tissue homeostasis, simultaneous deletion of both proteases in fibroblasts delays wound closure during skin repair. Notably, single and double deficiency of these proteases modulates myofibroblast formation and resolution in wounds.

Abstract: Summary
Quasi-two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic hybrid tin perovskites have emerged as promising alternatives to lead-based perovskites in thin-film photovoltaics because of their reduced toxicity and improved stability. However, the undesired small n-value 2D phases and disordered crystal orientation enormously restrict the efficiency of quasi-2D tin perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to uncontrollable nucleation and crystal growth processes. Here, we propose a mixed pseudo-halide anion engineering approach by using acetate (Ac−) and tetrafluoroborate (BF4−) anions to make quasi-2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a target formula of PEA2FA4Sn5I16. We find that the mixed Ac− and BF4− anions can not only promote homogeneously distributed PEA+ cations in the precursor by effectively breaking the PEA+···PEA+ stacking but also retard the crystallization process by coordinating with unbonded SnI2, thereby, significantly reducing small n-value 2D phases, improving the crystal orientation, and suppressing the Sn2+ oxidation. The resulting PSC exhibits up to 9% power conversion efficiency and 400 h stability.

Abstract: Summary
Brain-implanted stimulators are revolutionizing treatment of many neurological and psychiatric diseases, but still rely on temporary batteries for power, which require periodic replacements. Battery-free, self-sustainable deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices remain an unsolved challenge. Herein, we report a self-sustainable, battery-free, intermittent DBS system. This device is enabled by interfacing a high-performance bio-triboelectric nanogenerator (Bio-TENG) as an energy harvester with bio-supercapacitors as fast-charging energy storage units to intermittently drive a DBS pulse generator. The Bio-TENG acts as a smart breathing sensor and biomechanical energy harvester using the inhalation and exhalation motions of an inflated swine lung to charge bio-supercapacitors, which drive the pulse generator to stimulate neurons in mouse hippocampus tissues ex vivo. An intra-electrode triboelectrification strategy is used to boost the Bio-TENG power output. This sustainable intermittent power approach may provide a strategy for powering brain-machine bioelectronics.

Abstract: Early discover of risk progression of invisible carcinomas is important for a prerequisite successful treatment. Here, we investigated whether concentration of human thymidine kinase 1 (HTK1) discover invisible malignant human tumours. The HTK1 concentration of tumour cellular based on HTK1 IgY-polyclonal-antibody (HTK1-IgY-pAb) was determined by using a novel automatic chemiluminescence analyser with sandwich biotin-streptavidin (SBSA) platform. Minimum number of cells able to be detected by this technology used cells with low and high concentration of HTK1. The limit visibility by tumour imaging is approximately 1 mm in diameter, corresponding to approximately 109 cells with a cell diameter of 1 µm. Based on a HTK1 standard curve and a molecular weight of HTK1 of 96 kD, the HTK1protein (HTK1p) concentration per cell was calculated to be 0.021 pg. Assuming 200 pg in total protein/cell, approximately 50 × 106 growing malignant cells in the body were calculated to releases HTK1 into 5-liter blood. A HTK1 values of 3.914, 0.435 and 0.009 pmol/L corresponds to 10 × 105, 2 × 105 and 1 × 105 growing malignant cells, respectively. The lowest detectable sensitivity of HTK1 is 0.009 pmol/L in 1 × 105 growing malignant cells and 0.01 pmol/L in blood serum, detectable in health screening. Comparing the novel automatic chemiluminescence analyser with the original ECL dot-blot assay using serum HTK1p (health screening, n = 265) showed high correlation (r = 0.8743, P < .000). In conclusion, the novel automatic chemiluminescence analyser with SBSA platform is a reliable method with high accuracy to determine carcinoma invisible.

Abstract: Summary
Acquisition of large-area functional films is beneficial to the development of electronic skins (e-skins) in application of smart wearable sensors. Besides the excellent conductivity or mechanical properties of MXene, it is necessary to achieve controllable self-assembly of MXene film with large-scale for e-skins. Here, a versatile pH-induced oil-water (O/W) interfacial self-assembly engineering for fabrication of foot-level MXene film has been proposed, and as-prepared MXene film can be easily transferred onto various flexible substrates of glass plate, quartz plate, or polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Moreover, wearable ultrathin sensors based on foot-level MXene films can remotely monitor human activities (motion, physiological signals of pulse beating). Significantly, wearable e-skin enabled by foot-scale MXene film realizes effective capture of spatial information. Prospectively, pH-induced interfacial self-assembly of MXene provides an effective strategy for foot-scale two-dimensional films for wearable e-skin of motion sensors, which is promising for attractive wearable electronics in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Rechargeable Na-CO2 batteries are promising energy-storage devices due to their high energy density, environmental friendliness, and cost effectiveness. However, the insulating nature and irreversibility of the Na2CO3 discharge product cause large polarization and poor cyclicity. Here, we report a reversible quasi-solid-state Na-CO2 battery that is constructed by the synergistic action of a Co-encapsulated N-doped carbon framework catalyst and gel electrolyte to ensure the formation of a highly reversible Na2C2O4 discharge product. Experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that the electron-agglomeration effect of Co nanoparticles enhances CO2 adsorption and lowers energy barrier, as well as promotes Na2C2O4 generation. A gel electrolyte containing an imidazole organic cation is used to inhibit the decomposition of the thermodynamically unstable Na2C2O4. The fabricated Na-CO2 battery exhibits a high discharge capacity of 3,094 mAh g−1, a high-rate performance of 1,777 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, and excellent cycling performance of 366 cycles (2,200 h).

Abstract: Summary
Two-terminal (2T) perovskite on organic tandem solar cells (PSC/OPV TSCs) are attracting attention due to their fast improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE). Understanding both the optics and electronics is crucial in monolithic tandem devices. Here, we report an optoelectronic model developed for a 2T PSC/OPV TSC that helps determine the device’s most influential parameters and recombination mechanisms and elucidates the underlying physics. Our simulation results are validated with experiments, and a good agreement is obtained. The effects of surface coverage, bulk, and sheet resistances on charge carrier recombination in the interconnecting layer (ICL) are investigated with the model. When the ICL thickness is increased, we demonstrate that the mechanism in the ICL can change from charge carrier recombination to transport. Finally, a pathway toward the 30% practical PCE limit for PSC/OPV TSCs is identified, which requires the single-junction perovskite and organic sub-cells to reach PCEs of 22.3% and 20.4%, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Wearable pressure sensors have received recent attention due to their contributions to artificial intelligence, electronic skin, and the Internet of Things. However, this traditional sensor is faced with the integration dilemma caused by the need for external energy supply devices. Targeting this obstacle, here, we report a scheme that improves the battery as a pressure sensor. Benefiting by the redox potential conversion mechanism and the water-retention characteristics of calcium ion, this scheme can encode pressure signals into electrical signals, thus converting the battery into a pressure sensor. Proposed battery-type sensors exhibit notable sensing performance and have a high total power density of 1.93 mW cm−2 due to the improvement of conductivity to 1.08 × 10−3 S/cm, which is ∼4,000 times higher than that of the sensor prepared by unmodified GO solid electrolyte. Therefore, this study provides a general platform for manufacturing high-performance one-body electronic skin in passive mode.

Abstract: Summary
The coexistence of superconductivity and topology holds the potential to realize exotic quantum states of matter. Here, we report superconductivity induced by high pressure in three thallium-based materials, covering the phase transition from a normal insulator (TlBiS2) to a topological insulator (TlBiSe2) through a Dirac semimetal (TlBiSeS). By increasing the pressure up to 60 GPa, we observe superconductivity phase diagrams with maximal critical temperature (Tc) values at 6.0–8.1 K. Our density functional theory calculations reveal topological surface states in superconductivity phases for all three compounds. Our study paves the path to explore topological superconductivity and topological phase transitions.

Abstract: Summary
Achieving phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes (pc-LEDs) for portable NIR spectroscopy applications has evoked enormous demand for high-efficiency broadband NIR-II (1,000–1,700 nm) phosphors. Herein, a series of Li-alloyed (Li/Mg)O:Ni2+ phosphors with tunable NIR-II emission is prepared. By alloying Li-ions into MgO:Ni2+, we break the uniform coordination environment of Ni2+ emitters by substitutional disorder and induce many crystallographically equivalent Ni2+ emitters. This leads to large spectral tuning in the NIR-II region with the peak position and full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) varying in the 1,330–1,460 and 204–350 nm regions, respectively. Consequently, ultra-broadband (FWHM = 350 nm, 10.1 mW at 350 mA) and high-efficiency (FWHM = 204 nm, 19.7 mW at 350 mA) NIR-II pc-LEDs have been fabricated simultaneously based on the explored phosphors, and its applications are also demonstrated. We anticipate that this strategy can be used to explore other NIR phosphor systems, thus opening up new avenues for next-generation NIR spectroscopy technology.

Abstract: Summary
Currently, there is a drive to develop the organoelement chemistry of sodium, the most abundant alkali metal on earth, as an alternative to that of rarer lithium, with the prime focus on sustainability. Organolithium compounds have been essential to the success of synthetic chemistry for more than a century, although their implementation has been essentially confined to stoichiometric synthesis. Here, we report on synthetic, structural, catalytic, mechanistic, and theoretical studies of a series of sodium diphenylphosphides, having unique structures defined by the Lewis base donor D solvating the Lewis acidic sodium cation. These donor complexes are explored as hydrophosphination catalysts on reacting Ph2P–H with a range of alkynes and prove to be generally effective under ambient conditions, especially when n = 1 in [{Ph2PNa(D)x}n]. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have shed light on the possible mechanisms of these catalytic cycles and how they relate to the E, Z, or α isomer formed.

Abstract: Summary
Many materials have been tailored for sorption-based solar-thermal-driven atmospheric water harvesting (AWH), but AWH devices are still inefficient and unscalable. To close the large gap between materials research and practical application, a hydrogel-based composite sorbent (PCLG) with high adsorption capacity per unit volume has been developed with an optimized honeycomb structure, which has potential applications in global water harvesting. The PCLG sorbent achieves 1.8 g/cm3 water harvested under 30°C and 30% relative humidity (RH). The optimized honeycomb structure enables 50% water absorption improvement due to better heat and mass transfer performance. In outdoor experiments, our water harvester realizes 2.9 L/m2/day of water collected per cycle under natural sunlight. Based on PCLG properties and worldwide weather data, our device can yield up to 6 L/m2/day of water.

Abstract: Summary
Our objective is to tune a “lead” metal-organic framework, Ni(PyC)2 (pyridine-4-carboxylate [PyC]), by functionalizing its PyC ligands to maximize its adsorptive selectivity for xenon over krypton at room temperature. To guide experiments, we (1) construct a library of Ni(PyC-X)2 (X = functional group) crystal structure models then (2) use molecular simulations to predict their noble gas adsorption and selectivity at room temperature. Motivated by our virtual screening, we synthesize Ni(PyC-m-NH2)2, determine its crystal structure by X-ray powder diffraction, measure its Xe, Kr, and Ar adsorption isotherms (298 K), and indeed find that its dilute Xe/Kr selectivity at 298 K (20) exceeds that of its parent Ni(PyC)2 (17). Corroborated by molecular models, in situ X-ray diffraction shows that Ni(PyC-m-NH2)2 organizes well-defined, Xe-tailored binding pockets along its one-dimensional channels. Our study illustrates the computation-informed optimization of a “lead” metal-organic framework.

Abstract: In clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a principal membrane trafficking route of all eukaryotic cells, forces are applied to invaginate the plasma membrane and form endocytic vesicles. These forces are provided by specific endocytic proteins and the polymerizing actin cytoskeleton. One of the best-studied endocytic systems is endocytosis in yeast, known for its simplicity, experimental amenability, and overall similarity to human endocytosis. Importantly, the yeast endocytic protein machinery generates and transmits tremendous force to bend the plasma membrane, making this system beneficial for mechanistic studies of cellular force-driven membrane reshaping. This review summarizes important protein players, molecular functions, applied forces, and open questions and perspectives of this robust, actin-powered membrane-remodeling protein machine.

Abstract: Summary
Compared with traditional static insulation, a thermally switchable building envelope could reduce annual heating and cooling loads by intermittently coupling to the outside environment when beneficial. Here, we demonstrate a voltage-actuated, contact/non-contact thermal switch that meets the unique challenges of this application. The switch is non-volatile, consuming electricity only briefly while switching and none to hold steady state. The switch ratio is 12, the off state has a low effective thermal conductivity of 0.045Wm-1K-1, comparable to fiberglass insulation, and the performance is stable over 1,000 switching cycles. Numerical simulations using real-world climate data show that combining this thermal switch with a thermal storage layer in a building envelope can yield annual energy savings of 9%–55% (heating) and 17%–76% (air conditioning), depending on the climate zone. The greatest benefits are realized when the exterior temperature crosses well above and below the desired interior temperature within a single 24 h period.

Abstract: Summary
With the arrival of autonomous and connected vehicles, it remains unclear how automation and connectivity will impact the energy consumption of electric vehicles. Here, we report the energy impacts induced by these emerging technologies on electric vehicles in a realistic urban environment based on high-resolution empirical data and high-fidelity simulations. We find that, contrary to optimistic predictions, automated vehicles (AVs) alone in fact increase energy consumption compared with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in a complicated urban environment (e.g., with distributed signalized intersections), while connected and automated vehicles outperform in energy, safety, and mobility. Also, based on our field experiments, scenario AV has a lower average speed compared with scenario HDV. These findings suggest that systematic efforts integrating AV technology innovations from the private sector and connected vehicle infrastructure investment from the public sector are essential to accomplish the ultimate vision of green urban transportation.

Abstract: Summary
Carboxylic acids are cheap, abundant, and environmentally friendly and are widely employed as partners in cross-coupling reactions. Transition-metal-catalyzed carboxylic acid transformations are typically achieved at extreme temperatures (usually >150°C), significantly limiting their practicality. Here, iron-catalyzed decarbonylation of aryl and alkyl carboxylic acids has been developed, providing the corresponding borylated products with good efficiency. This protocol features excellent functional group compatibility, mild conditions, and the late-stage borylation of bio-relevant carboxylic acids, thus offering excellent opportunities for applications in medicinal chemistry and organic synthesis. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the iron(I)-boryl species may be the crucial intermediate and that a decarbonylative process is involved in this catalytic transformation.

Abstract: Summary
Passive cooling relying on evaporation and radiation, while offering great energy-saving opportunities, faces challenges with low ambient cooling powers, environmental heating, high water usage, and climate condition constraints. To overcome these shortcomings, here, we present insulated cooling with evaporation and radiation (ICER), which utilizes a solar-reflecting layer; an infrared-emitting evaporative layer; and an infrared-transparent, solar-reflecting, and vapor-permeable insulation layer. One major advantage of ICER is that it synergistically combines thermal insulation, evaporative cooling, and radiative cooling. Consequently, it consistently achieves below-wet-bulb temperatures with much less water consumption than pure evaporation while reaching 9.3°C below the ambient temperature under direct sunlight. With unfavorable climate conditions, ICER delivers 96 W/m2 daytime cooling power at the ambient temperature and shows a 300% enhancement over the state-of-the-art radiative cooler. During the summer months, without electricity, ICER can extend food shelf life by 40% in humid climates and 200% in dry climates with low water-refilling frequencies.

Abstract: Summary
Wastewater containing organic pollutants, such as emulsion, soluble organic sewage, oily seawater, and acid/alkali corrosive sewage, poses a grand challenge to the existing membrane separation technology for obtaining freshwater. Inspired by leaf structure, here we report a carbon felt/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) solar-driven device to separate versatile oily wastewater. This evaporator exhibits superior full-spectrum solar energy absorption (88%) and steady vapor release capacity (1.3–1.4 kg m−2 h−1) under 1.0 sun irradiation. The carbon felt/PVA foam with strong underwater superoleophobicity cannot only achieve efficient separation of oil-in-water but also purify extra high oil/water ratio emulsion directly with high efficiency of 99.99%. It is noteworthy, for seawater-emulsion and water-soluble organic sewage, that the purification efficiency of carbon felt/PVA foam can exceed 99.86%. More importantly, strong acid and alkali water do not affect the operation of carbon felt/PVA foam. This work provides a feasible method to purify versatile wastewater in a harsh environment.

Abstract: Summary
Artificial materials exhibiting ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP), especially those with tunable multicolor afterglow, are hindered by complicated synthesis and purification, poor processability, and issues relating to sustainability. Here, we report natural hemicelluloses that provide excitation- and time-dependent color-tunable afterglow. In particular, linear xylan with high crystallinity exhibits a long lifetime of 588.8 ms under ambient conditions, not inferior to many artificial phosphors, and has achieved industrial production. Mechanistic study shows that the tunable UOP can be ascribed to various clusters of oxygen groups fixed within a rigid polysaccharide environment. The distinguishable color evolution and duration of afterglow are useful for anticounterfeiting and data encryption with high security levels. Furthermore, body-shaped foams with a lifetime up to approximately 700 ms and flexible, transparent, and high-strength phosphorescence film can also be fabricated using water-soluble oxidized xylan. These results unambiguously state that hemicellulose-based UOP materials are convincingly promising to replace and surpass artificial phosphors.

Abstract: In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) terms HIV and tobacco use among the ten most important public health challenges we face today. In the last decade, there has been a remarkable decrease in the number of deaths due to HIV/AIDS, especially after the widespread availability and use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, people living with HIV/AIDS have a heightened risk of chronic complications and comorbidities, including neurological disorders. Around 40–60 % of HIV-infected individuals progress to NeuroAIDS, a group of disorders caused primarily by HIV-mediated damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems, despite receiving cART. The detrimental effects of chronic smoking on the cerebrovascular system are also well studied and reported. Addictive behavior, such as smoking, is more common in HIV patients compared to the general population. In this context, given the existing immune suppression, smoking can pose a significant risk for the progression of the disease to NeuroAIDS by disrupting the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here we show that co-treatment with Tobacco Smoke Extract (TSE) and HIV-1 gp120 (HIV envelope glycoprotein) in primary cultures of human brain microvascular endothelial cells promoted heightened cellular stress responses compared to control and individual treatments. Our findings suggest that a potential synergistic effect between smoke exposure and gp120 can worsen the loss of BBB viability, possibly exacerbating NeuroAIDS progression.

Abstract: Summary
Nitride materials have promising properties for optoelectronics, but synthesis is challenging because of their metastable character. Therefore, even some simple binary nitrides have not been reported, and their properties remain unknown. Here, we report a metastable Sb–N phase. Unconstrained first-principle crystal-structure predictions suggest that a semiconducting layered SbN phase could be synthesized under activated nitrogen conditions. Experimentally, we approach the synthesis by rapid thermal annealing of an amorphous thin-film precursor. In situ X-ray diffraction monitoring reveals a transient phase appearing at 500°C and lasting for 17 s. With molecular dynamics simulations, we conclude that the phase observed is related to the predicted ground-state structure but that it contains stacking variations. This research highlights the synergy between computational materials discovery and in situ structural characterization during synthesis and processing, enabling the identification and synthesizability of new materials at the frontier of thermodynamically metastable regions.

Abstract: Summary
The stable cycling of lithium electrode has been significantly impeded by the lack of comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the complicated chemistry and unclear formation/evolution mechanisms of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here we report the formation mechanism of an operando polymerized SEI at the Li/electrolyte interface in an ether electrolyte and its dynamic evolution during the lithium growth process. The polymerization process is initiated by the consumption of the polymerization inhibitor LiNO3 with the formation of inorganic lithium salts at the Li-electrolyte interface, followed by instantaneous ring-opening polymerization of the cyclic ether solvent triggered by the initiator FSO2NSO2· radical, leading to the formation of a polymeric-inorganic composite SEI. The resulted SEI exhibits excellent mechanical flexibility and self-healing property that can effectively accommodate more than 100 times’ swelling of lithium during growth by stretching and thinning itself from ∼100 nm to 7 nm, achieving an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (99.73%) for lithium plating/stripping.

Abstract: Summary
The regioselective polyfunctionalization of highly symmetric spherical Ih-C60 is extremely challenging and usually leads to the formation of regioisomeric mixtures not amenable for high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification. Here, we pioneer the use of tetragonal prismatic nanocapsules to perform selective Diels-Alder (DA) functionalization of encapsulated Ih-C60 using acenes. The supramolecular mask allows the regioselective synthesis of either e,e-bis-anthracene-C60 (functionalization at 90°) or the synthesis of trans-1-bis-pentacene-C60 (functionalization at 180°) by changing only the acene length. Moreover, the mask strategy allows one to obtain unprecedented equatorial hetero-tris-functionalized-C60 adducts combining Diels-Alder with Bingel mask regiofunctionalization. Computational modeling provides crucial insights to rationalize the regioselective control exerted by the supramolecular mask on the successive DA cycloadditions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed significant differences in the host-guest interactions and equilibrium established between the first-formed anthracene- and pentacene-based mono-adducts with the nanocapsule, which finally determine the observed orthogonal regioselectivity.

Abstract: Summary
Hydroformylation of olefins with H2 and CO is an important industrial process for aldehyde production, and developing Earth-abundant catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability remains challenging. Here, we synthesize a rhodium-like high-efficiency single-atom cobalt catalyst over β-Mo2C toward olefin hydroformylation. During the hydroformylation of propene, the single atomic cobalt catalyst achieves a turnover number of 3,834 and a turnover frequency of 749 h−1, which to our knowledge surpasses all the reported heterogeneous cobalt-based catalysts and approaches the performance of rhodium catalysts. Moreover, the catalyst can be reused five times without an obvious activity decline, confirming the excellent stability of single-atom Co supported on β-Mo2C. We demonstrate that a Co1-MoxCy motif forms on the carbide surface with electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI). Such an EMSI effect plays a pivotal role in optimizing the charge density, reducing the reaction barrier, and stabilizing the active site.

Abstract: Summary
Protein homeostasis collapse typically leads to protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils and diffuse amorphous aggregates, which both occur in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases, but their relationship remains to be clarified. Here we examine the interactions between the amorphously aggregated non-chaperone proteins (albumin, β-lactoglobulin, and superoxide dismutase 1) and Alzheimer’s amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Amorphous aggregates suppress the primary nucleation and elongation of Aβ fibrillation and modulate Aβ toxicity. The higher inhibitory efficiency of intermediately sized molten globular aggregates (20–300 nm) on Aβ fibrillation is hypothesized to be due to the higher amount of exposed hydrophobic residues and higher free energy. The formed co-aggregates are off-pathway species that favor formation of the amorphous end state instead of fibrillar amyloid structures normally formed by Aβ. Our findings expand our knowledge of how the native and aggregated cellular proteins modulate Aβ aggregation at the molecular and mesoscopic level and point out the major conclusions.

Abstract: Summary
C2H4 is an essential precursor for synthesis of a range of industrial chemicals while contributing ∼150 Mt of CO2e emissions per year. C2H4 synthesis via electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive approach to reduce carbon emissions. The lower single-pass conversion (<10%) of the state-of-the-art CO2 electrolyzers contributes significantly to the cost of post-CO2RR separation of products, rendering even processes with high CO2RR current densities unfit for scaling up. Here, we develop an aqueous flow-through electrochemical cell to enhance the activity and selectivity of C2H4 on a three-dimensional (3D) Cu mesh electrode by applying square-wave oscillating potentials. A high C2H4 faradaic efficiency of ∼58%, C2H4 current density of 306 mA/cm2, and gaseous C2H4 purity of ∼52 wt % without CO2 in the product stream are obtained. Integrating the 3D Cu mesh catalyst in a photovoltaic (PV) electrolyzer yields a solar-to-carbon (STC) efficiency of ∼10% with a solar-to-C2H4 efficiency of ∼4%.

Abstract: Summary
Protein-polymer conjugates (PPCs) improve therapeutic efficacy of proteins and have been widely used for the treatment of various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and hepatitis. PEGylation is considered as the “gold standard” in bioconjugation, although in practice its clinical applications are becoming limited because of extensive evidence of immunogenicity induced by pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies in patients. Here, optimized reaction conditions for living aqueous grafting-from ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) are utilized to synthesize water-soluble polynorbornene (PNB)-based PPCs of lysozyme (Lyz-PPCs) and bacteriophage Qβ (Qβ-PPCs) as PEG alternatives. Lyz-PPCs retain nearly 100% bioactivity and Qβ-PPCs exhibit up to 35% decrease in protein immunogenicity. Qβ-PPCs derived from NB-PEG show no reduction in recognition by anti-PEG antibodies while Qβ-PPCs derived from NB-Zwit show >95% reduction as compared with Qβ-PEG. This work demonstrates a new method for PPC synthesis and the utility of grafting from PPCs to evade immune recognition.

Large extracellular vesicles do not mitigate the harmful effect of hyperglycemia on endothelial cell mobility,

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles, especially the larger fraction (LEVs – large extracellular vesicles), are believed to be an important means of intercellular communication. Earlier studies on LEVs have shown their healing properties, especially in the vascular cells of diabetic patients. Uptake of LEVs by endothelial cells and internalization of their cargo have also been demonstrated. Endothelial cells change their properties under hyperglycemic conditions (HGC), which reduces their activity and is the cause of endothelial dysfunction. The aim of our study was to investigate how human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) change their biological properties: shape, mobility, cell surface stiffness, as well as describe the activation of metabolic pathways after exposure to the harmful effects of HGC and the administration of LEVs released by endothelial cells. We obtained LEVs from HUVEC cultures in HGC and normoglycemia (NGC) using the filtration and ultracentrifugation methods. We assessed the size of LEVs and the presence of biomarkers such as phosphatidylserine, CD63, beta-actin and HSP70. We analyzed the LEVs uptake efficiency by HUVECs, HUVEC shape, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, surface stiffness and finally gene expression by mRNA analysis. Under HGC conditions, HUVECs were larger and had a stiffened surface and a strengthened actin cortex compared to cells under NGC condition. HGC also altered the activation of metabolic pathways, especially those related to intracellular transport, metabolism, and organization of cellular components. The most interesting observation in our study is that LEVs did not restore cell motility disturbed by HGC. Although, LEVs were not able to reverse this deleterious effect of HGC, they activated transcription of genes involved in protein synthesis and vesicle trafficking in HUVECs.

Abstract: Summary
The development of new, efficient ways to initiate redox events has long been a goal in organic synthesis. A redox system mediated by carbon dioxide radical and dimsyl anions is demonstrated and a variety of transformations, including hydrocarboxylation, hydroxycarboxylation, Birch reduction, and three-component reductive coupling of carbonyl compounds, amines, and cyanopyridines, are achieved in a catalyst-free fashion using this method, giving valuable acids, saturated skeletons, and α-pyridyl amines in high efficiency. This strategy promises wide applications in other types of reactions and complements current photoredox catalysis methodologies.
Keywords: catalyst-free; alkenes; formate salts; dimsyl anion; carbon dioxide radical anion

Abstract: Summary
The ability to regulate protein abundance provides huge opportunities for the development of treatments for various diseases. The proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) provides powerful tools to degrade these undruggable targets, becoming a promising technology. Herein, we report the development of aptamer-based PROTACs as a novel strategy to broaden the spectrum of targets. The RNA aptamer of the target protein applied in targeted degradation. A heterobifunctional molecule can recruit E3 ubiquitin ligase to a genetically encoded tandem aptamer RNA scaffold, promoting ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins. Partial degradations of different target proteins, including p50, p65, and E2F1, have been achieved by simply replacing the 3′ module on the RNA scaffold with the corresponding RNA aptamers. Besides, simultaneous degradation of multiple target proteins is realized through inserting more aptamer into RNA scaffold. Thus, the aptamer-based PROTAC technology offers a general strategy for targeted protein degradation in drug discovery and biological research.

Abstract: For cells to adhere, migrate and proliferate, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is required. This process consumes a large amount of ATP while having an intimate connection with cellular metabolism. Signaling pathways that regulate energy homeostasis can also affect actin dynamics, whereas a variety of actin binding proteins directly or indirectly interact with the anabolic and catabolic regulators in cells. Here, we discuss the inter-regulation between actin filaments and cellular metabolism, reviewing recent discoveries on key metabolic enzymes that respond to actin remodeling as well as historical findings on metabolic stress-induced cytoskeletal reorganization. We also address emerging techniques that would benefit the study of cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular metabolism in high spatial-temporal resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Structural DNA nanotechnology has been applied to construct complex static and dynamic DNA structures. Seeded growth, intended to regulate the crucial nucleation step, has been used to control the assembly of DNA tiles. However, most of the seeded growth strategies were applied to fixed DNA tiles, whereas the seeded growth on dynamic DNA tiles remains unreported. Here, we propose a seeded growth strategy in which dynamic tiles adaptively change their shapes to match the architecture of a DNA origami seed. Furthermore, when more adaptive DNA tiles assemble on a reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA) seed, the conformation of DODA seeds is reversibly affected by the spontaneous reconfiguration of adaptive tiles. The adaptive seeded growth provides a mechanism for the construction of complex DNA nanomachines and may offer a general and adaptable method for the advancement of responsive materials, with active, autonomous, and adaptive spatiotemporal control properties.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we report photonic nanostructures replicated from the adaxial epidermis of flower petals onto light-polymerized coatings using low-cost nanoimprint lithography at ambient temperature. These multifunctional nanocoatings are applied to confer enhanced light trapping, water repellence, and UV light and environmental moisture protection features in perovskite solar cells. The former feature helps attain a maximum power conversion efficiency of 24.61% (21.01% for the reference cell) without any additional device optimization. Added to these merits, the nanocoatings also enable stable operation under AM 1.5G and UV light continuous illumination or in real-world conditions. Our engineering approach provides a simple way to produce multifunctional nanocoatings optimized by nature’s wisdom.

Abstract: Chemical methods for regulating CRISPR activity hold great potential for spatiotemporal control of gene editing technologies. Here we report a small-molecule strategy to switch off CRISPR functionality. We develop clickable RNAs by modifying RNAs with an azido-containing functionality, which can be covalently conjugated in a second step with a complementary reaction partner, DBCO (dibenzocyclooctyne). We show that multimeric DBCO behaves quite differently than monoDBCO by imposing steric and topological constraints on RNAs. This generalizable strategy lays a solid foundation for developing clickable CRISPR off switches. We also show that this strategy works well for terminating CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing in human cells.

Abstract: Summary
Lithium metal batteries are considered to have great potential as rechargeable batteries in next-generation energy storage devices. However, the generation of dead lithium and lithium dendrites caused by the rupture of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) during cycling limits the application of lithium metal batteries. While tremendous efforts have been devoted to modification of SEI, the long-term and stable use of residual SEI has rarely been studied. Herein, we design a LiF-rich three-dimensional SEI framework (3DSF) formed in a toroidal magnetic field. This 3DSF can induce the uniform bottom-up deposition of lithium metal in the channel structure and realize 1,300 cycles at a high current density of 50 mA/cm2. The capacity of the battery paired with a high mass-loading LiFePO4 cathode (18.3 mg/cm2) maintains 98.2% at 1 C after 150 cycles. This work provides a simple and practical strategy for the additive free development of lithium metal battery technology.

Abstract: Summary
The allosteric effect, described as biological enzymes’ conformation change to accommodate specific substrates, plays an important role in metabolic regulation. However, well-organized aggregation of synthetic receptors into high-order supramolecular structures with different conformations and functions in response to a variety of external stimuli presents a formidable challenge. Herein, a series of quadruple-stranded helicates are created through the templation effect of halide ions in a library of metallo-macrocycles. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction unambiguously confirms that the four intertwined strands are bridged with halide ions via eight robust C–H···X¯ hydrogen bonds, four anion-π interactions, and two electrostatic contacts. The binding of I¯ results in a D2-symmetric helicate, while the Br¯ or Cl¯ adducts display asymmetric infrastructures. Furthermore, the templation effect exhibits non-thermodynamically controlled, high selectivity toward I¯ due to its nucleophilicity toward breaking up partial coordination bonds.

Effect of cell culture media on extracellular vesicle secretion from mesenchymal stromal cells and neurons,

Abstract: Background
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by neuronal cells in vitro have promising therapeutic potential for brain diseases. Optimization of cell culture conditions and methodologies for high-yield isolation of EVs for preclinical and clinical applications, however, remains a challenge.
Objective
To probe the cell culture conditions required for optimal EV secretion by human-derived neuronal cells.
Methodology
First, we optimized the EV purification protocol using human mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) cultures. Next, we compared the effects of different variables in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neuronal cultures on EV secretion. EVs were isolated from cell conditioned media (CCM) and control media with no cells (NCC) using ultrafiltration combined with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The hPSC neurons were cultured in 2 different media from which EVs were collected at 2 maturation time-points (days 46 and 60). Stimulation with 25 mM KCl was also evaluated as an activator of EV secretion by neurons. The collected SEC fractions were analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), protein concentration assay, and blinded transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Results
A peak in cup-shaped particles was observed in SEC fractions 7–10 of MSC samples, but not corresponding media controls, indicating successful isolation of EVs. Culture medium had no significant effect on EV yield. The EV yield of the samples did not differ significantly according to the culture media used or the cell maturation time-points. Stimulation of neurons with KCl for 3 h reduced rather than increased the EV yield.
Conclusions
We demonstrated successful EV isolation from MSC and neuronal cells using an ultrafiltration-SEC method. The EV yield from MSC and neuronal cultures exhibited a large batch effect, apparently related to the culture media used, highlighting the importance of including NCC as a negative control in all cell culture experiments.

Abstract: Summary
Real-time diagnosis is required to ensure the safety, reliability, and durability of the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) system. Two categories of methods are (1) intrusive, time consuming, or require alterations to the cell architecture but provide detailed information about the system or (2) rapid and benign but low-information-yielding. A strategy based on alternating current (AC) voltage response and one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed as a methodology for detailed and rapid fuel cell diagnosis. AC voltage response signals contain within them the convoluted information that is also available via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), such as capacitive, inductive, and diffusion processes, and direct use of time-domain signals can avoid time-frequency conversion. It also overcomes the disadvantage that EIS can only be measured under steady-state conditions. The utilization of multi-frequency excitation can make the proposed approach an ideal real-time diagnostic/characterization tool for fuel cells and other electrochemical power systems.
