Abstract: Summary
Although increasing evidence suggests potential iatrogenic injury from supplemental oxygen therapy, significant exposure to hyperoxia in critically ill patients is inevitable. This study shows that hyperoxia causes lung injury in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, prolonged inspiration of oxygen at concentrations higher than 80% is found to cause redox imbalance and impair alveolar microvascular structure. Knockout of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (Cxcr1) inhibits the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from neutrophils and synergistically enhances the ability of endothelial cells to eliminate ROS. We also combine transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analysis and find that CXCR1 knockdown promotes glutamine metabolism and leads to reduced glutathione by upregulating the expression of malic enzyme 1. This preclinical evidence suggests that a conservative oxygen strategy should be recommended and indicates that targeting CXCR1 has the potential to restore redox homeostasis by reducing oxygen toxicity when inspiratory hyperoxia treatment is necessary.

Abstract: Summary
Many diseases show patterns of co-occurrence, possibly driven by systemic dysregulation of underlying processes affecting multiple traits. We have developed a method (treeLFA) for identifying such multimorbidities from routine health-care data, which combines topic modeling with an informative prior derived from medical ontology. We apply treeLFA to UK Biobank data and identify a variety of topics representing multimorbidity clusters, including a healthy topic. We find that loci identified using topic weights as traits in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis, which we validated with a range of approaches, only partially overlap with loci from GWASs on constituent single diseases. We also show that treeLFA improves upon existing methods like latent Dirichlet allocation in various ways. Overall, our findings indicate that topic models can characterize multimorbidity patterns and that genetic analysis of these patterns can provide insight into the etiology of complex traits that cannot be determined from the analysis of constituent traits alone.

Abstract: Summary
Amino acid (aa) metabolism is closely correlated with the pathogenesis of psoriasis; however, details on aa transportation during this process are barely known. Here, we find that SLC38A5, a sodium-dependent neutral aa transporter that counter-transports protons, is markedly upregulated in the psoriatic skin of both human patients and mouse models. SLC38A5 deficiency significantly ameliorates the pathogenesis of psoriasis, indicating a pathogenic role of SLC38A5. Surprisingly, SLC38A5 is almost exclusively expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) when analyzing the psoriatic lesion and mainly locates on the lysosome. Mechanistically, SLC38A5 potentiates lysosomal acidification, which dictates the cleavage and activation of TLR7 with ensuing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-23 (IL-23) and IL-1β from DCs and eventually aggravates psoriatic inflammation. In summary, this work uncovers an auxiliary mechanism in driving lysosomal acidification, provides inspiring insights for DC biology and psoriasis etiology, and reveals SLC38A5 as a promising therapeutic target for treating psoriasis.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) orchestrates a suppressive tumor microenvironment that fosters immunotherapy resistance. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the principal immune cell infiltrating PDA and are heterogeneous. Here, by employing macrophage fate-mapping approaches and single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that monocytes give rise to most macrophage subsets in PDA. Tumor-specific CD4, but not CD8, T cells promote monocyte differentiation into MHCIIhi anti-tumor macrophages. By conditional major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II deletion on monocyte-derived macrophages, we show that tumor antigen presentation is required for instructing monocyte differentiation into anti-tumor macrophages, promoting Th1 cells, abrogating Treg cells, and mitigating CD8 T cell exhaustion. Non-redundant IFNγ and CD40 promote MHCIIhi anti-tumor macrophages. Intratumoral monocytes adopt a pro-tumor fate indistinguishable from that of tissue-resident macrophages following loss of macrophage MHC class II or tumor-specific CD4 T cells. Thus, tumor antigen presentation by macrophages to CD4 T cells dictates TAM fate and is a major determinant of macrophage heterogeneity in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-characterized form of synaptic plasticity, is believed to underlie memory formation. Hebbian, postsynaptically expressed LTP requires TARPγ-8 phosphorylation for synaptic insertion of AMPA receptors (AMPARs). However, it is unknown whether TARP-mediated AMPAR insertion alone is sufficient to modify behavior. Here, we report the development of a chemogenetic tool, ExSYTE (Excitatory SYnaptic Transmission modulator by Engineered TARPγ-8), to mimic the cytoplasmic interaction of TARP with the plasma membrane in a doxycycline-dependent manner. We use this tool to examine the specific role of synaptic AMPAR potentiation in amygdala neurons that are activated by fear conditioning. Selective expression of active ExSYTE in these neurons potentiates AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in a doxycycline-dependent manner, occludes synaptically induced LTP, and mimics freezing triggered by cued fear conditioning. Thus, chemogenetic controlling of the TARP-membrane interaction is sufficient for LTP-like synaptic AMPAR insertion, which mimics fear conditioning.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses acquire host genes via horizontal transfer and can express them to manipulate host biology during infections. Some homologs retain sequence identity, but evolutionary divergence can obscure host origins. We use structural modeling to compare vaccinia virus proteins with metazoan proteomes. We identify vaccinia A47L as a homolog of gasdermins, the executioners of pyroptosis. An X-ray crystal structure of A47 confirms this homology, and cell-based assays reveal that A47 interferes with caspase function. We also identify vaccinia C1L as the product of a cryptic gene fusion event coupling a Bcl-2-related fold with a pyrin domain. C1 associates with components of the inflammasome, a cytosolic innate immune sensor involved in pyroptosis, yet paradoxically enhances inflammasome activity, suggesting differential modulation during infections. Our findings demonstrate the increasing power of structural homology screens to reveal proteins with unique combinations of domains that viruses capture from host genes and combine in unique ways.

Abstract: Summary
Schwann cells play critical roles in peripheral neuropathies; however, the regulatory mechanisms of their homeostasis remain largely unknown. Here, we show that nucleoporin Seh1, a component of nuclear pore complex, is important for Schwann cell homeostasis. Expression of Seh1 decreases as mice age. Loss of Seh1 leads to activated immune responses and cell necroptosis. Mice with depletion of Seh1 in Schwann cell lineage develop progressive reduction of Schwann cells in sciatic nerves, predominantly non-myelinating Schwann cells, followed by neural fiber degeneration and malfunction of the sensory and motor system. Mechanistically, Seh1 safeguards genome stability by mediating the interaction between SETDB1 and KAP1. The disrupted interaction after ablation of Seh1 derepresses endogenous retroviruses, which triggers ZBP1-dependent necroptosis in Schwann cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Seh1 is required for Schwann cell homeostasis by maintaining genome integrity and suggest that decrease of nucleoporins may participate in the pathogenesis of periphery neuropathies.

Abstract: Summary
Variants of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), in which severe inflammation occurs in the brain due to innate immune activation. Here, we analyze the RNA-editing status and innate immune activation in an AGS mouse model that carries the Adar P195A mutation in the N terminus of the ADAR1 p150 isoform, the equivalent of the P193A human Zα variant causal for disease. This mutation alone can cause interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in the brain, especially in the periventricular areas, reflecting the pathologic feature of AGS. However, in these mice, ISG expression does not correlate with an overall decrease in RNA editing. Rather, the enhanced ISG expression in the brain due to the P195A mutant is dose dependent. Our findings indicate that ADAR1 can regulate innate immune responses through Z-RNA binding without changing overall RNA editing.

Abstract: Summary
MYC proto-oncogene dysregulation alters metabolism, translation, and other functions in ways that support tumor induction and maintenance. Although Myc+/− mice are healthier and longer-lived than control mice, the long-term ramifications of more complete Myc loss remain unknown. We now describe the chronic consequences of body-wide Myc inactivation initiated postnatally. “MycKO” mice acquire numerous features of premature aging, including altered body composition and habitus, metabolic dysfunction, hepatic steatosis, and dysregulation of gene sets involved in functions that normally deteriorate with aging. Yet, MycKO mice have extended lifespans that correlate with a 3- to 4-fold lower lifetime cancer incidence. Aging tissues from normal mice and humans also downregulate Myc and gradually alter many of the same Myc target gene sets seen in MycKO mice. Normal aging and its associated cancer predisposition are thus highly linked via Myc.

Abstract: Purpose
Curcumin can regulate the polarization of microglia and alleviate traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, its detailed action mechanism on downregulating Complement 1q-like-3 protein (C1ql3) in TBI is less reported. The purpose of this study is to explore the role and mechanism of curcumin-regulated C1ql3 in TBI.
Method
GSE23639 dataset was used to acquire gene data for microglia. C57BL/6 J wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to establish a controlled cortical impact model of TBI. The effects of curcumin (200 mg/kg) on the brain injury, inflammatory cytokine levels, microglia polarization, and C1ql3 protein expression in mice and BV-2 cells were detected by H&E staining, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot, respectively. The effects of curcumin (5, 10, 20 μmol/L) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS, 1 µg/mL) on the viability of BV-2 cells were determined by MTT assay. After the transfection of C1ql3 overexpression plasmid, C1ql3 expression, IL-1β and IL-6 levels, and the number of CD16+/32+ and CD206+ cells were determined by qRT-PCR, ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively.
Result
C1ql3 expression was down-regulated in microglia after the curcumin treatment. Curcumin treatment could alleviate the TBI-induced brain injury in mice, reduce IL-1β and IL-6 levels, promote M2 polarization of microglia, and decrease C1ql3 protein expression. For BV-2 cells, curcumin treatment had no significant toxic effect on cell viability, but reversed the effect of LPS on cells, while C1ql3 overexpression counteracted the effect of curcumin.
Conclusion
Curcumin induces M2 microglia polarization through down-regulating C1ql3 expression, which may become a new treatment method for TBI.

Abstract: Summary
The eukaryotic genome is organized to enable the precise regulation of gene expression. This organization is established as the embryo transitions from a fertilized gamete to a totipotent zygote. To understand the factors and processes that drive genomic organization, we focused on the pioneer factor GAGA factor (GAF) that is required for early development in Drosophila. GAF transcriptionally activates the zygotic genome and is localized to subnuclear foci. This non-uniform distribution is driven by binding to highly abundant GA repeats. At GA repeats, GAF is necessary to form heterochromatin and silence transcription. Thus, GAF is required to establish both active and silent regions. We propose that foci formation enables GAF to have opposing transcriptional roles within a single nucleus. Our data support a model in which the subnuclear concentration of transcription factors acts to organize the nucleus into functionally distinct domains essential for the robust regulation of gene expression.

Abstract: Orange carotenoid protein (OCP) of photosynthetic cyanobacteria binds to ketocarotenoids noncovalently and absorbs excess light to protect the host organism from light-induced oxidative damage. Herein, we found that mutating valine 40 in the α3 helix of Gloeocapsa sp. PCC 7513 (GlOCP1) resulted in blue- or red-shifts of 6-20 nm in the absorption maxima of the lit forms. We analyzed the origins of absorption maxima shifts by integrating X-ray crystallography, homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. Our analysis suggested that the single residue mutations alter the polar environment surrounding the bound canthaxanthin, thereby modulating the degree of charge transfer in the photoexcited state of the chromophore. Our integrated investigations reveal the mechanism of color adaptation specific to OCPs and suggest a design principle for color-specific photoswitches.

Abstract: Summary
Rare genetic variants in ANK2, which encodes ankyrin-B, are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs); however, their pathogenesis is poorly understood. We find that mice with prenatal deletion in cortical excitatory neurons and oligodendrocytes (Ank2−/−:Emx1-Cre), but not with adolescent deletion in forebrain excitatory neurons (Ank2−/−:CaMKIIα-Cre), display severe spontaneous seizures, increased mortality, hyperactivity, and social deficits. Calcium imaging of cortical slices from Ank2−/−:Emx1-Cre mice shows increased neuronal calcium event amplitude and frequency, along with network hyperexcitability and hypersynchrony. Quantitative proteomic analysis of cortical synaptic membranes reveals upregulation of dendritic spine plasticity-regulatory proteins and downregulation of intermediate filaments. Characterization of the ankyrin-B interactome identifies interactors associated with autism and epilepsy risk factors and synaptic proteins. The AMPA receptor antagonist, perampanel, restores cortical neuronal activity and partially rescues survival in Ank2−/−:Emx1-Cre mice. Our findings suggest that synaptic proteome alterations resulting from Ank2 deletion impair neuronal activity and synchrony, leading to NDDs-related behavioral impairments.

Abstract: Summary
Social decision making requires the integration of reward valuation and social cognition systems, both dependent on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). How these two OFC functions interact is largely unknown. We recorded intracranial activity from the OFC of ten patients making choices in a social context where reward inequity with a social counterpart varied and could be either advantageous or disadvantageous. We find that OFC high-frequency activity (HFA; 70–150 Hz) encodes self-reward, consistent with previous reports. We also observe encoding of the social counterpart’s reward, as well as the type of inequity being experienced. Additionally, we find evidence of inequity-dependent reward encoding: depending on the type of inequity, electrodes rapidly and reversibly switch between different reward-encoding profiles. These results provide direct evidence for encoding of self- and other rewards in the human OFC and highlight the dynamic nature of encoding in the OFC as a function of social context.

Abstract: Summary
While germline copy-number variants (CNVs) contribute to schizophrenia (SCZ) risk, the contribution of somatic CNVs (sCNVs)—present in some but not all cells—remains unknown. We identified sCNVs using blood-derived genotype arrays from 12,834 SCZ cases and 11,648 controls, filtering sCNVs at loci recurrently mutated in clonal blood disorders. Likely early-developmental sCNVs were more common in cases (0.91%) than controls (0.51%, p = 2.68e−4), with recurrent somatic deletions of exons 1–5 of the NRXN1 gene in five SCZ cases. Hi-C maps revealed ectopic, allele-specific loops forming between a potential cryptic promoter and non-coding cis-regulatory elements upon 5′ deletions in NRXN1. We also observed recurrent intragenic deletions of ABCB11, encoding a transporter implicated in anti-psychotic response, in five treatment-resistant SCZ cases and showed that ABCB11 is specifically enriched in neurons forming mesocortical and mesolimbic dopaminergic projections. Our results indicate potential roles of sCNVs in SCZ risk.

Abstract: Summary
Cell fate stability is essential to maintaining “law and order” in complex animals. However, high stability comes at the cost of reduced plasticity and, by extension, poor regenerative ability. This evolutionary trade-off has resulted in most modern animals being rather simple and regenerative or complex and non-regenerative. The mechanisms mediating cellular plasticity and allowing for regeneration remain unknown. We show that signals emitted by senescent cells can destabilize the differentiated state of neighboring somatic cells, reprogramming them into stem cells that are capable of driving whole-body regeneration in the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of senescence prevents reprogramming and regeneration. Conversely, induction of transient ectopic senescence in a regenerative context results in supernumerary stem cells and faster regeneration. We propose that senescence signaling is an ancient mechanism mediating cellular plasticity. Understanding the senescence environment that promotes cellular reprogramming could provide an avenue to enhance regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of protein homeostasis degrades with age, contributing to aging-related decline and disease. Previous studies have primarily surveyed transcriptional aging changes. To define the effects of age directly at the protein level, we perform discovery-based proteomics in 10 tissues from 20 C57BL/6J mice, representing both sexes at adult and late midlife ages (8 and 18 months). Consistent with previous studies, age-related changes in protein abundance often have no corresponding transcriptional change. Aging results in increases in immune proteins across all tissues, consistent with a global pattern of immune infiltration with age. Our protein-centric data reveal tissue-specific aging changes with functional consequences, including altered endoplasmic reticulum and protein trafficking in the spleen. We further observe changes in the stoichiometry of protein complexes with important roles in protein homeostasis, including the CCT/TriC complex and large ribosomal subunit. These data provide a foundation for understanding how proteins contribute to systemic aging across tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Saccadic eye movements are known to cause saccadic suppression, a temporary reduction in visual sensitivity and visual cortical firing rates. While saccadic suppression has been well characterized at the level of perception and single neurons, relatively little is known about the visual cortical networks governing this phenomenon. Here we examine the effects of saccadic suppression on distinct neural subpopulations within visual area V4. We find subpopulation-specific differences in the magnitude and timing of peri-saccadic modulation. Input-layer neurons show changes in firing rate and inter-neuronal correlations prior to saccade onset, and putative inhibitory interneurons in the input layer elevate their firing rate during saccades. A computational model of this circuit recapitulates our empirical observations and demonstrates that an input-layer-targeting pathway can initiate saccadic suppression by enhancing local inhibitory activity. Collectively, our results provide a mechanistic understanding of how eye movement signaling interacts with cortical circuitry to enforce visual stability.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial cell-wall hydrolases must be tightly regulated during bacterial cell division to prevent aberrant cell lysis and to allow final separation of viable daughter cells. In a multidisciplinary work, we disclose the molecular dialogue between the cell-wall hydrolase LytB, wall teichoic acids, and the eukaryotic-like protein kinase StkP in Streptococcus pneumoniae. After characterizing the peptidoglycan recognition mode by the catalytic domain of LytB, we further demonstrate that LytB possesses a modular organization allowing the specific binding to wall teichoic acids and to the protein kinase StkP. Structural and cellular studies notably reveal that the temporal and spatial localization of LytB is governed by the interaction between specific modules of LytB and the final PASTA domain of StkP. Our data collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of how LytB performs final separation of daughter cells and highlights the regulatory role of eukaryotic-like kinases on lytic machineries in the last step of cell division in streptococci.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor cell phenotypes and anti-tumor immune responses are shaped by local metabolite availability, but intratumoral metabolite heterogeneity (IMH) and its phenotypic consequences remain poorly understood. To study IMH, we profiled tumor/normal regions from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients. A common pattern of IMH transcended all patients, characterized by correlated fluctuations in the abundance of metabolites and processes associated with ferroptosis. Analysis of intratumoral metabolite-RNA covariation revealed that the immune composition of the microenvironment, especially the abundance of myeloid cells, drove intratumoral metabolite variation. Motivated by the strength of RNA-metabolite covariation and the clinical significance of RNA biomarkers in ccRCC, we inferred metabolomic profiles from the RNA sequencing data of ccRCC patients enrolled in 7 clinical trials, and we ultimately identifyied metabolite biomarkers associated with response to anti-angiogenic agents. Local metabolic phenotypes, therefore, emerge in tandem with the immune microenvironment, influence ongoing tumor evolution, and are associated with therapeutic sensitivity.

Abstract: Summary
Regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the transcription factor (TF) Foxp3 also express other TFs shared by T helper (Th) subsets under certain conditions. Here, to determine the roles of T-bet-expressing Treg cells, we generate a mouse strain, called VeDTR, in which T-bet/Foxp3 double-positive cells are engineered to be specifically labeled and depleted by a combination of Cre- and Flp-recombinase-dependent gene expression control. Characterization of T-bet+Foxp3+ cells using VeDTR mice reveals high resistance under oxidative stress, which is involved in accumulation of T-bet+Foxp3+ cells in tumor tissues. Moreover, short-term depletion of T-bet+Foxp3+ cells leads to anti-tumor immunity but not autoimmunity, whereas that of whole Treg cells does both. Although ablation of T-bet+Foxp3+ cells during Toxoplasma infection slightly enhances Th1 immune responses, it does not affect the course of the infection. Collectively, the intersectional genetic method reveals the specific roles of T-bet+Foxp3+ cells in suppressing tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy lacks persistent efficacy with “on-target, off-tumor” toxicities for treating solid tumors. Thus, an antibody-guided switchable CAR vector, the chimeric Fc receptor CD64 (CFR64), composed of a CD64 extracellular domain, is designed. T cells expressing CFR64 exert more robust cytotoxicity against cancer cells than CFR T cells with high-affinity CD16 variant (CD16v) or CD32A as their extracellular domains. CFR64 T cells also exhibit better long-term cytotoxicity and resistance to T cell exhaustion compared with conventional CAR T cells. With trastuzumab, the immunological synapse (IS) established by CFR64 is more stable with lower intensity induction of downstream signaling than anti-HER2 CAR T cells. Moreover, CFR64 T cells exhibit fused mitochondria in response to stimulation, while CARH2 T cells contain predominantly punctate mitochondria. These results show that CFR64 T cells may serve as a controllable engineered T cell therapy with prolonged persistence and long-term antitumor activity.

Abstract: Summary
Bidirectional communication between the developing conceptus and endometrium is essential for pregnancy recognition and establishment in ruminants. We dissect the transcriptomic dynamics of sheep conceptus and corresponding endometrium at pre- and peri-implantation stages using single-cell RNA sequencing. Spherical blastocysts contain five cell types, with 68.62% trophectoderm cells. Strikingly, elongated conceptuses differentiate into 17 cell types, indicating dramatic cell fate specifications. Cell-type-specific gene expression delineates the features of distinctive trophectoderm lineages and indicates that the transition from polar trophectoderm to trophoblast increases interferon-tau expression and likely drives elongation initiation. We identify 13 endometrium-derived cell types and elucidate their molecular responses to conceptus development. Integrated analyses uncover multiple paired transcripts mediating the dialogues between extraembryonic membrane and endometrium, including IGF2-IGF1R, FGF19-FGFR1, NPY-NPY1R, PROS1-AXL, and ADGRE5-CD55. These data provide insight into the molecular regulation of conceptus elongation and represent a valuable resource for functional investigations of pre- and peri-implantation ruminant development.

Abstract: Summary
Ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs) are targets for modulation in Hebbian and homeostatic synaptic plasticity and are remodeled by development, experience, and disease. We have probed the impact of synaptic glutamate levels on the two postsynaptic GluR subtypes at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, GluRA and GluRB. We first demonstrate that GluRA and GluRB compete to establish postsynaptic receptive fields, and that proper GluR abundance and composition can be orchestrated in the absence of any synaptic glutamate release. However, excess glutamate adaptively tunes postsynaptic GluR abundance, echoing GluR scaling observed in mammalian systems. Furthermore, when GluRA vs. GluRB competition is eliminated, GluRB becomes insensitive to glutamate modulation. In contrast, GluRA is now homeostatically regulated by excess glutamate to maintain stable miniature activity, where Ca2+ permeability through GluRA receptors is required. Thus, excess glutamate, GluR competition, and Ca2+ signaling collaborate to selectively target GluR subtypes for homeostatic regulation at postsynaptic compartments.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding tumor microenvironment (TME) reprogramming in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) progression may uncover novel therapeutic targets. Here, we performed single-cell profiling of precancerous lesions, localized and metastatic GACs, identifying alterations in TME cell states and compositions as GAC progresses. Abundant IgA+ plasma cells exist in the premalignant microenvironment, whereas immunosuppressive myeloid and stromal subsets dominate late-stage GACs. We identified six TME ecotypes (EC1-6). EC1 is exclusive to blood, while EC4, EC5, and EC2 are highly enriched in uninvolved tissues, premalignant lesions, and metastases, respectively. EC3 and EC6, two distinct ecotypes in primary GACs, associate with histopathological and genomic characteristics, and survival outcomes. Extensive stromal remodeling occurs in GAC progression. High SDC2 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is linked to aggressive phenotypes and poor survival, and SDC2 overexpression in CAFs contributes to tumor growth. Our study provides a high-resolution GAC TME atlas and underscores potential targets for further investigation.

Abstract: Summary
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade consisting of MKKK, MKK, and MPK plays an indispensable role in various plant physiological processes. Previously, we showed that phosphorylation of MabZIP21 by MaMPK6-3 is involved in banana fruit ripening, but the regulatory mechanism by which MKK controls banana fruit ripening remains unclear. Here, ripening-induced MaMKK1 from banana fruit is characterized, and transiently overexpressing and silencing of MaMKK1 in banana fruit accelerates and inhibits fruit ripening, respectively, possibly by influencing phosphorylation and activity of MPK. MaMKK1 interacts with and phosphorylates MaMPK6-3 and MaMPK11-4 mainly at the pTEpY residues, resulting in MPK activation. MaMPK11-4 phosphorylates MabZIP21 to elevate its transcriptional activation ability. Transgenic tomato fruit expressing MabZIP21 ripen quickly with a concomitant increase in MabZIP21 phosphorylation. Additionally, MabZIP21 activates MaMPK11-4 and MaMKK1 transcription to form a regulatory feedback loop. Collectively, here we report a regulatory pathway of the MaMPK6-3/11-4-MabZIP21 module in controlling banana fruit ripening.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia shift toward an inflammatory phenotype during aging that is thought to exacerbate age-related neurodegeneration. The molecular and cellular signals that resolve neuroinflammation post-injury are largely undefined. Here, we exploit systems genetics methods based on the extended BXD murine reference family and identify IGFBPL1 as an upstream cis-regulator of microglia-specific genes to switch off inflammation. IGFBPL1 is expressed by mouse and human microglia, and higher levels of its expression resolve lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation by resetting the transcriptome signature back to a homeostatic state via IGF1R signaling. Conversely, IGFBPL1 deficiency or selective deletion of IGF1R in microglia shifts these cells to an inflammatory landscape and induces early manifestation of brain tauopathy and retinal neurodegeneration. Therapeutic administration of IGFBPL1 drives pro-homeostatic microglia and prevents glaucomatous neurodegeneration and vision loss in mice. These results identify IGFBPL1 as a master driver of the counter-inflammatory microglial modulator that presents an endogenous resolution of neuroinflammation to prevent neurodegeneration in eye and brain.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is known as an intractable, highly heterogeneous tumor encompassing multiple subclones, each supported by a distinct glioblastoma stem cell (GSC). The contribution of GSC genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity to tumor subclonal properties is debated. In this study, we describe the systematic derivation, propagation, and characterization of multiple distinct GSCs from single, treatment-naive GBMs (GSC families). The tumorigenic potential of each GSC better correlates with its transcriptional profile than its genetic make-up, with classical GSCs being inherently more aggressive and mesenchymal more dependent on exogenous growth factors across multiple GBMs. These GSCs can segregate and recapitulate different histopathological aspects of the same GBM, as shown in a paradigmatic tumor with two histopathologically distinct components, including a conventional GBM and a more aggressive primitive neuronal component. This study provides a resource for investigating how GSCs with distinct genetic and/or phenotypic features contribute to individual GBM heterogeneity and malignant escalation.

Abstract: Summary
The ATR kinase safeguards genomic integrity during S phase, but how ATR protects DNA replication forks remains incompletely understood. Here, we combine four distinct assays to analyze ATR functions at ongoing and newly assembled replication forks upon replication inhibition by hydroxyurea. At ongoing forks, ATR inhibitor (ATRi) increases MRE11- and EXO1-mediated nascent DNA degradation from PrimPol-generated, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps. ATRi also exposes template ssDNA through fork uncoupling and nascent DNA degradation. Electron microscopy reveals that ATRi reduces reversed forks by increasing gap-dependent nascent DNA degradation. At new forks, ATRi triggers MRE11- and CtIP-initiated template DNA degradation by EXO1, exposing nascent ssDNA. Upon PARP inhibition, ATRi preferentially exacerbates gap-dependent nascent DNA degradation at ongoing forks in BRCA1/2-deficient cells and disrupts the restored gap protection in BRCA1-deficient, PARP-inhibitor-resistant cells. Thus, ATR protects ongoing and new forks through distinct mechanisms, providing an extended view of ATR’s functions in stabilizing replication forks.

Abstract: Summary
System-level analysis of single-cell data is rapidly transforming the field of immunometabolism. Given the competitive demand for nutrients in immune microenvironments, there is a need to understand how and when immune cells access these nutrients. Here, we describe a new approach for single-cell analysis of nutrient uptake where we use in-cell biorthogonal labeling of a functionalized amino acid after transport into the cell. In this manner, the bona fide active uptake of glutamine via SLC1A5/ASCT2 could be quantified. We used this assay to interrogate the transport capacity of complex immune subpopulations, both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings provide an easy sensitive single-cell assay to assess which cells support their function via SLC1A5-mediated uptake. This is a significant addition to the single-cell metabolic toolbox required to decode the metabolic landscape of complex immune microenvironments.

Abstract: Summary
The lateral habenula (LHb) has been considered a moderator of social behaviors. However, it remains unknown how LHb regulates social interaction. Here, we show that the hydroxymethylase Tet2 is highly expressed in the LHb. Tet2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice exhibit impaired social preference; however, replenishing Tet2 in the LHb rescues social preference impairment in Tet2 cKO mice. Tet2 cKO alters DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC) modifications in genes that are related to neuronal functions, as is confirmed by miniature two-photon microscopy data. Further, Tet2 knockdown in the glutamatergic neurons of LHb causes impaired social behaviors, but the inhibition of glutamatergic excitability restores social preference. Mechanistically, we identify that Tet2 deficiency reduces 5hmC modifications on the Sh3rf2 promoter and Sh3rf2 mRNA expression. Interestingly, Sh3rf2 overexpression in the LHb rescues social preference in Tet2 cKO mice. Therefore, Tet2 in the LHb may be a potential therapeutic target for social behavior deficit-related disorders such as autism.

Abstract: Summary
Replication forks terminate at TERs and telomeres. Forks that converge or encounter transcription generate topological stress. Combining genetics, genomics, and transmission electron microscopy, we find that Rrm3hPif1 and Sen1hSenataxin helicases assist termination at TERs; Sen1 specifically acts at telomeres. rrm3 and sen1 genetically interact and fail to terminate replication, exhibiting fragility at termination zones (TERs) and telomeres. sen1rrm3 accumulates RNA-DNA hybrids and X-shaped gapped or reversed converging forks at TERs; sen1, but not rrm3, builds up RNA polymerase II (RNPII) at TERs and telomeres. Rrm3 and Sen1 restrain Top1 and Top2 activities, preventing toxic accumulation of positive supercoil at TERs and telomeres. We suggest that Rrm3 and Sen1 coordinate the activities of Top1 and Top2 when forks encounter transcription head on or codirectionally, respectively, thus preventing the slowing down of DNA and RNA polymerases. Hence Rrm3 and Sen1 are indispensable to generate permissive topological conditions for replication termination.

Abstract: Summary
Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) induces weight loss and increases insulin action in obese rodents. Whether and how GDF15 improves insulin action without weight loss is unknown. Obese rats were treated with GDF15 and displayed increased insulin tolerance 5 h later. Lean and obese female and male mice were treated with GDF15 on days 1, 3, and 5 without weight loss and displayed increased insulin sensitivity during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp on day 6 due to enhanced suppression of endogenous glucose production and increased glucose uptake in WAT and BAT. GDF15 also reduced glucagon levels during clamp independently of the GFRAL receptor. The insulin-sensitizing effect of GDF15 was completely abrogated in GFRAL KO mice and also by treatment with the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and in β1,β2-adrenergic receptor KO mice. GDF15 activation of the GFRAL receptor increases β-adrenergic signaling, in turn, improving insulin action in the liver and white and brown adipose tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Transactivation of Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) by EGF leads to cell surface transport of TrkB, promoting its signaling responsiveness to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a critical process for proper cortical plate development. However, the mechanisms that regulate the transport of TrkB to the cell surface are not fully understood. Here, we identified Calnexin as a regulator for targeting TrkB either to the cell surface or toward autophagosomal processing. Calnexin-deficient mouse embryos show impaired cortical plate formation and elevated levels of transactivated TrkB. In Calnexin-depleted mouse neuronal precursor cells, we detected an impaired cell surface transport of TrkB in response to EGF and an impaired delivery to autophagosomes. Mechanistically, we show that Calnexin facilitates the interaction of TrkB with the ER-phagy receptor Fam134b, thereby targeting TrkB to ER-phagy. This mechanism appears as a critical process for fine-tuning the sensitivity of neurons to BDNF.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrient starvation drives yeast meiosis, whereas retinoic acid (RA) is required for mammalian meiosis through its germline target Stra8. Here, by using single-cell transcriptomic analysis of wild-type and Stra8-deficient juvenile mouse germ cells, our data show that the expression of nutrient transporter genes, including Slc7a5, Slc38a2, and Slc2a1, is downregulated in germ cells during meiotic initiation, and this process requires Stra8, which binds to these genes and induces their H3K27 deacetylation. Consequently, Stra8-deficient germ cells sustain glutamine and glucose uptake in response to RA and exhibit hyperactive mTORC1/protein kinase A (PKA) activities. Importantly, expression of Slc38a2, a glutamine importer, is negatively correlated with meiotic genes in the GTEx dataset, and Slc38a2 knockdown downregulates mTORC1/PKA activities and induces meiotic gene expression. Thus, our study indicates that RA via Stra8, a chordate morphogen pathway, induces meiosis partially by generating a conserved nutrient restriction signal in mammalian germ cells by downregulating their nutrient transporter expression.

Abstract: Summary
The E3 ubiquitin ligase Ube3a is biallelically expressed in neural progenitors and glial cells, suggesting that UBE3A gain-of-function mutations might cause neurodevelopmental disorders irrespective of parent of origin. Here, we engineered a mouse line that harbors an autism-linked UBE3AT485A (T503A in mouse) gain-of-function mutation and evaluated phenotypes in animals that inherited the mutant allele paternally, maternally, or from both parents. We find that paternally and maternally expressed UBE3AT503A results in elevated UBE3A activity in neural progenitors and glial cells. Expression of UBE3AT503A from the maternal allele, but not the paternal one, leads to a persistent elevation of UBE3A activity in neurons. Mutant mice display behavioral phenotypes that differ by parent of origin. Expression of UBE3AT503A, irrespective of its parent of origin, promotes transient embryonic expansion of Zcchc12 lineage interneurons. Phenotypes of Ube3aT503A mice are distinct from Angelman syndrome model mice. Our study has clinical implications for a growing number of disease-linked UBE3A gain-of-function mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Proton-dependent oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are promiscuous transporters of the major facilitator superfamily that constitute the main route of entry for a wide range of dietary peptides and orally administrated peptidomimetic drugs. Given their clinical and pathophysiological relevance, several POT homologs have been studied extensively at the structural and molecular level. However, the molecular basis of recognition and transport of diverse peptide substrates has remained elusive. We present 14 X-ray structures of the bacterial POT DtpB in complex with chemically diverse di- and tripeptides, providing novel insights into the plasticity of the conserved central binding cavity. We analyzed binding affinities for more than 80 peptides and monitored uptake by a fluorescence-based transport assay. To probe whether all 8400 natural di- and tripeptides can bind to DtpB, we employed state-of-the-art molecular docking and machine learning and conclude that peptides with compact hydrophobic residues are the best DtpB binders.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of stem cell maintenance underlies the establishment of long-term and mass culture methods for stem cells that are fundamental for clinical and agricultural applications. In this study, we use chicken primordial germ cell (PGC) as a model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying stem cell maintenance. The PGC is a useful experimental model because it is readily gene-manipulatable and easy to test gene function in vivo using transplantation. Previous studies to establish a long-term culture system have shown that secreted factors such as FGF2 are required to maintain the self-renewal capability of PGC. On the other hand, we know little about intracellular regulators responsible for PGC maintenance. Among representative stem cell factors, we focus on RNA-binding factors LIN28A and LIN28B as possible central regulators for the gene regulatory network essential to PGC maintenance. By taking advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing and a clonal culture technique, we find that both LIN28A and LIN28B regulate the proliferation of PGC in vitro. We further showed that colonization efficiency of grafted PGC at the genital ridges, rudiments for the gonads, of chicken embryos were significantly decreased by knockout (KO) of LIN28A or LIN28B. Of note, overexpression of human LIN28 in LIN28-KO PGC was sufficient to restore the low colonization rates, suggesting that LIN28 plays a key role in PGC colonization at the gonads. Transcriptomic analyses of LIN28-KO PGC reveal that several genes related to mesenchymal traits are upregulated, including EGR1, a transcription factor that promotes the differentiation of mesodermal tissues. Finally, we show that the forced expression of human EGR1 deteriorates replication activity and colonization efficiency of PGCs. Taken together, this work demonstrates that LIN28 maintains self-renewal of PGC by suppressing the expression of differentiation genes including EGR1.

Abstract: Summary
The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in the modulation of social behavior by encoding internal states. The hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin neurons, initially identified as regulators of sleep and appetite, are important for emotional and motivated behaviors. However, their role in social behavior remains unclear. Using fiber photometry and behavioral analysis, we show here that hypocretin neurons differentially encode social discrimination based on the nature of social encounters. The optogenetic inhibition of hypocretin neuron activity or blocking of hcrt-1 receptors reduces the amount of time mice are engaged in social interaction in males but not in females. Reduced hcrt-1 receptor signaling during social interaction is associated with altered activity in the insular cortex and ventral tegmental area in males. Our data implicating hypocretin neurons as sexually dimorphic regulators within social networks have significant implications for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases with social dysfunction, particularly considering varying prevalence among sexes.

Abstract: Summary
Milk oligosaccharides (MOs) are among the most abundant constituents of breast milk and are essential for health and development. Biosynthesized from monosaccharides into complex sequences, MOs differ considerably between taxonomic groups. Even human MO biosynthesis is insufficiently understood, hampering evolutionary and functional analyses. Using a comprehensive resource of all published MOs from >100 mammals, we develop a pipeline for generating and analyzing MO biosynthetic networks. We then use evolutionary relationships and inferred intermediates of these networks to discover (1) systematic glycome biases, (2) biosynthetic restrictions, such as reaction path preference, and (3) conserved biosynthetic modules. This allows us to prune and pinpoint biosynthetic pathways despite missing information. Machine learning and network analysis cluster species by their milk glycome, identifying characteristic sequence relationships and evolutionary gains/losses of motifs, MOs, and biosynthetic modules. These resources and analyses will advance our understanding of glycan biosynthesis and the evolution of breast milk.

Abstract: Summary
Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) describes the formation of pseudo blood vessels constructed of tumor cells that have acquired endothelial-like properties. VM channels endow the tumor with a tumor-derived vascular system that directly connects to host blood vessels, and their presence is generally associated with poor patient prognosis. Here we show that the transcription factor, Foxc2, promotes VM in diverse solid tumor types by driving ectopic expression of endothelial genes in tumor cells, a process that is stimulated by hypoxia. VM-proficient tumors are resistant to anti-angiogenic therapy, and suppression of Foxc2 augments response. This work establishes co-option of an embryonic endothelial transcription factor by tumor cells as a key mechanism driving VM proclivity and motivates the search for VM-inhibitory agents that could form the basis of combination therapies with anti-angiogenics.

Abstract: Summary
Rad24-RFC (replication factor C) loads the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp onto the recessed 5′ ends by binding a 5′ DNA at an external surface site and threading the 3′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) into 9-1-1. We find here that Rad24-RFC loads 9-1-1 onto DNA gaps in preference to a recessed 5′ end, thus presumably leaving 9-1-1 on duplex 3′ ss/double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) after Rad24-RFC ejects from DNA. We captured five Rad24-RFC-9-1-1 loading intermediates using a 10-nt gap DNA. We also determined the structure of Rad24-RFC–9-1-1 using a 5-nt gap DNA. The structures reveal that Rad24-RFC is unable to melt DNA ends and that a Rad24 loop limits the dsDNA length in the chamber. These observations explain Rad24-RFC’s preference for a preexisting gap of over 5-nt ssDNA and suggest a direct role of the 9-1-1 in gap repair with various TLS (trans-lesion synthesis) polymerases in addition to signaling the ATR kinase.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T cells recognize a broad range of peptide epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which contribute to immune memory and limit COVID-19 disease. We demonstrate that the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 peptides, in the context of the model allotype HLA-DR1, does not correlate with their binding affinity to the HLA heterodimer. Analyzing six epitopes, some with very low binding affinity, we solve X-ray crystallographic structures of each bound to HLA-DR1. Further structural definitions reveal the precise molecular impact of viral variant mutations on epitope presentation. Omicron escaped ancestral SARS-CoV-2 immunity to two epitopes through two distinct mechanisms: (1) mutations to TCR-facing epitope positions and (2) a mechanism whereby a single amino acid substitution caused a register shift within the HLA binding groove, completely altering the peptide-HLA structure. This HLA-II-specific paradigm of immune escape highlights how CD4+ T cell memory is finely poised at the level of peptide-HLA-II presentation.

Abstract: One of the most common complications of chronic scrotal hyperthermia (SHT) is a serious disorder in the male reproductive system. The most important factor in the occurrence of these disorders is oxidative stress. Currently, we investigated the effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), as a highly potent antioxidant, against cells and tissue disorders in mice affected by chronic SHT. Fifty-six male adult NMRI mice were allocated into seven equal groups. Except the non-treated (Control) group, six other groups were exposed to heat stress. Two treated groups including Preventive and Curative received oral administration of EGCG (50 mg/kg/day) starting immediately before heat exposure and fifteen consecutive days after the end of the heat exposure, respectively. For each treated group, two subgroups including positive control (Pre/Cur + PC groups) and vehicle (Pre/Cur + vehicle groups) were considered. At the end of the study, sperm characteristics, testosterone levels, stereological parameters, apoptosis, oxidant state, and molecular assessments were performed. We found that the sperm parameters, testosterone levels, the numerical density of spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, spermatids, sertoli, leydig cells, and seminiferous tubules, biochemical factors (except MDA), and expression of c-kit gene were significantly higher in the Preventive and Curative groups, especially in Preventive ones, compared to other groups (P < 0.05). This is while expression of HSP72 and NF-κβ genes, MDA levels, as well as density of apoptotic cells considerably decreased in both EGCG-treated groups compared to other groups and it was more pronounced in Preventive ones (P < 0.05). Generally, EGCG attenuated cellular and molecular disorders induced by heat stress in the testis and it was more pronounced in Preventive status.

Abstract: Summary
RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is responsible for transcribing 5S ribosomal RNA (5S rRNA), tRNAs, and other short non-coding RNAs. Its recruitment to the 5S rRNA promoter requires transcription factors TFIIIA, TFIIIC, and TFIIIB. Here, we use cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize the S. cerevisiae complex of TFIIIA and TFIIIC bound to the promoter. Gene-specific factor TFIIIA interacts with DNA and acts as an adaptor for TFIIIC-promoter interactions. We also visualize DNA binding of TFIIIB subunits, Brf1 and TBP (TATA-box binding protein), which results in the full-length 5S rRNA gene wrapping around the complex. Our smFRET study reveals that the DNA within the complex undergoes both sharp bending and partial dissociation on a slow timescale, consistent with the model predicted from our cryo-EM results. Our findings provide new insights into the transcription initiation complex assembly on the 5S rRNA promoter and allow us to directly compare Pol III and Pol II transcription adaptations.

Abstract: Summary
Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) can transdifferentiate into macrophage-like cells in the context of sustained inflammatory injury, which drives vascular hyperplasia and atherosclerotic complications. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify that macrophage-like VSMCs are the key cell population in mouse neointimal hyperplasia. Sex-determining region Y (SRY)-related HMG-box gene 10 (Sox10) upregulation is associated with macrophage-like VSMC accumulation and pyroptosis in vitro and in the neointimal hyperplasia of mice. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced Sox10 lactylation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner by PI3K/AKT signaling drives transcriptional programs of VSMC transdifferentiation, contributing to pyroptosis. The regulator of G protein signaling 5 (RGS5) interacts with AKT and blocks PI3K/AKT signaling and Sox10 phosphorylation at S24. Sox10 silencing mitigates vascular inflammation and forestalls neointimal hyperplasia in RGS5 knockout mice. Collectively, this study shows that Sox10 is a regulator of vascular inflammation and a potential control point in inflammation-related vascular disease.

Abstract: Summary
Stress-related psychiatric disorders and the stress system show prominent differences between males and females, as well as strongly divergent transcriptional changes. Despite several proposed mechanisms, we still lack the understanding of the molecular processes at play. Here, we explore the contribution of cell types to transcriptional sex dimorphism using single-cell RNA sequencing. We identify cell-type-specific signatures of acute restraint stress in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, a central hub of the stress response, in male and female mice. Further, we show that a history of chronic mild stress alters these signatures in a sex-specific way, and we identify oligodendrocytes as a major target for these sex-specific effects. This dataset, which we provide as an online interactive app, offers the transcriptomes of thousands of individual cells as a molecular resource for an in-depth dissection of the interplay between cell types and sex on the mechanisms of the stress response.

Abstract: Summary
Melatonin has been reported to improve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and exploring the underlying mechanisms will be beneficial for better treatment of NAFLD. Choline-deficient high-fat diet (CDHFD)- and methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD)-fed mice with melatonin intervention exhibit significantly decreased liver steatosis, lobular inflammation, and focal liver necrosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that melatonin selectively inhibits pro-inflammatory CCR3+ monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMFs) and upregulates anti-inflammatory CD206+ MoMFs in NAFLD mice. Liver-infiltrating CCR3+CD14+ MoMFs are also significantly increased in patients with NAFLD. Mechanistically, melatonin receptor-independent BTG2-ATF4 signaling plays a role in the regulation of CCR3+ MoMF endoplasmic reticulum stress, survival, and inflammation. In contrast, melatonin upregulates CD206+ MoMF survival and polarization via MT1/2 receptors. Melatonin stimulation also regulates human CCR3+ MoMF and CD206+ MoMF survival and inflammation in vitro. Furthermore, CCR3 depletion antibody monotherapy inhibits liver inflammation and improves NAFLD in mice. Thus, therapies targeting CCR3+ MoMFs may have potential benefits in NAFLD treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic protein translation is a complex process that requires the participation of different proteins. Defects in the translational machinery often result in embryonic lethality or severe growth defects. Here, we report that RNase L inhibitor 2/ATP-BINDING CASSETTE E2 (RLI2/ABCE2) regulates translation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Null mutation of rli2 is gametophytic and embryonic lethal, whereas knockdown of RLI2 causes pleiotropic developmental defects. RLI2 interacts with several translation-related factors. Knockdown of RLI2 affects the translational efficiency of a subset of proteins involved in translation regulation and embryo development, indicating that RLI2 has critical roles in these processes. In particular, RLI2 knockdown mutant exhibits decreased expression of genes involved in auxin signaling and female gametophyte and embryo development. Therefore, our results reveal that RLI2 facilitates assembly of the translational machinery and indirectly modulates auxin signaling to regulate plant growth and development.

Abstract: Summary
The nucleolus is the most prominent membraneless organelle within the nucleus. How the nucleolar structure is regulated is poorly understood. Here, we identified two types of nucleoli in C. elegans. Type I nucleoli are spherical and do not have visible nucleolar vacuoles (NoVs), and rRNA transcription and processing factors are evenly distributed throughout the nucleolus. Type II nucleoli contain vacuoles, and rRNA transcription and processing factors exclusively accumulate in the periphery rim. The NoV contains nucleoplasmic proteins and is capable of exchanging contents with the nucleoplasm. The high-order structure of the nucleolus is dynamically regulated in C. elegans. Faithful rRNA processing is important to prohibit NoVs. The depletion of 27SA2 rRNA processing factors resulted in NoV formation. The inhibition of RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) transcription and depletion of two conserved nucleolar factors, nucleolin and fibrillarin, prohibits the formation of NoVs. This finding provides a mechanism to coordinate structure maintenance and gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in the testis support the lifelong production of sperm. SSCs reside within specialized microenvironments called “niches,” which are essential for SSC self-renewal and differentiation. However, our understanding of the molecular and cellular interactions between SSCs and niches remains incomplete. Here, we combine spatial transcriptomics, computational analyses, and functional assays to systematically dissect the molecular, cellular, and spatial composition of SSC niches. This allows us to spatially map the ligand-receptor (LR) interaction landscape in both mouse and human testes. Our data demonstrate that pleiotrophin regulates mouse SSC functions through syndecan receptors. We also identify ephrin-A1 as a potential niche factor that influences human SSC functions. Furthermore, we show that the spatial re-distribution of inflammation-related LR interactions underlies diabetes-induced testicular injury. Together, our study demonstrates a systems approach to dissect the complex organization of the stem cell microenvironment in health and disease.

Abstract: Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) is essential for regulating the development of the organism and sustaining the internal environmental homeostasis of multi-cellular tissue. Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8), an indispensable regulator of the skeletal system, is implicated in regulating chondrocyte growth, differentiation, and disease occurrence. However, the influence of FGF8 on GJIC in chondrocytes is not yet known. The study aims to investigate the role of FGF8 on cell-cell communication in chondrocytes and its underlying biomechanism. We found that FGF8 facilitated cell-cell communication in living chondrocytes by the up-regulation of connexin43 (Cx43), the major fundamental component unit of gap junction channels in chondrocytes. FGF8 activated p38-MAPK signaling to increase the expression of Cx43 and promote the cell-cell communication. Inhibition of p38-MAPK signaling impaired the increase of Cx43 expression and cell-cell communication induced by FGF8, indicating the importance of p38-MAPK signaling. These results help to understand the role of FGF8 on cell communication and provide a potential cue for the treatment of cartilage diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Several phospholipid (PL) molecules are intertwined with some mitochondrial complex I (CI) subunits in the membrane domain of CI, but their function is unclear. We report that when the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of the intramitochondrial PL transporter, STARD7, is severely disrupted, assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system is impaired, and the biogenesis of several CI subcomplexes is hampered. However, intriguingly, a restrained knockdown of STARD7 impairs the incorporation of NDUFS5 and NDUFA1 into the proximal part of the CI membrane domain without directly affecting the incorporation of subunits in the distal part of the membrane domain, OXPHOS complexes already assembled, or mitochondrial cristae integrity. Importantly, the restrained knockdown of STARD7 appears to induce a modest amount of cardiolipin remodeling, indicating that there could be some alteration in the composition of the mitochondrial phospholipidome. We conclude that PLs can regulate CI biogenesis independent of their role in maintaining mitochondrial membrane integrity.

Abstract: Summary
This study identifies interleukin-6 (IL-6)-independent phosphorylation of STAT3 Y705 at the early stage of infection with several viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). Such activation of STAT3 is dependent on the retinoic acid-induced gene I/mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein/spleen tyrosine kinase (RIG-I/MAVS/Syk) axis and critical for antiviral immunity. We generate STAT3Y705F/+ knockin mice that display a remarkably suppressed antiviral response to IAV infection, as evidenced by impaired expression of several antiviral genes, severe lung tissue injury, and poor survival compared with wild-type animals. Mechanistically, STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation restrains IAV pathogenesis by repressing excessive production of interferons (IFNs). Blocking phosphorylation significantly augments the expression of type I and III IFNs, potentiating the virulence of IAV in mice. Importantly, knockout of IFNAR1 or IFNLR1 in STAT3Y705F/+ mice protects the animals from lung injury and reduces viral load. The results indicate that activation of STAT3 by Y705 phosphorylation is vital for establishment of effective antiviral immunity by suppressing excessive IFN signaling induced by viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
The sodium-activated Slo2.2 channel is abundantly expressed in the brain, playing a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability. The Na+-binding site and the underlying mechanisms of Na+-dependent activation remain unclear. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human Slo2.2 in closed, open, and inhibitor-bound form at resolutions of 2.6–3.2 Å, revealing gating mechanisms of Slo2.2 regulation by cations and a potent inhibitor. The cytoplasmic gating ring domain of the closed Slo2.2 harbors multiple K+ and Zn2+ sites, which stabilize the channel in the closed conformation. The open Slo2.2 structure reveals at least two Na+-sensitive sites where Na+ binding induces expansion and rotation of the gating ring that opens the inner gate. Furthermore, a potent inhibitor wedges into a pocket formed by pore helix and S6 helix and blocks the pore. Together, our results provide a comprehensive structural framework for the investigation of Slo2.2 channel gating, Na+ sensation, and inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Left-dominant [Ca2+]i elevation on the left margin of the ventral node furnishes the initial laterality of mouse embryos. It depends on extracellular leftward fluid flow (nodal flow), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)/sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, and the PKD1L1 polycystin subunit, of which interrelationship is still elusive. Here, we show that leftward nodal flow directs PKD1L1-containing fibrous strands and facilitates Nodal-mediated [Ca2+]i elevation on the left margin. We generate KikGR-PKD1L1 knockin mice in order to monitor protein dynamics with a photoconvertible fluorescence protein tag. By imaging those embryos, we have identified fragile meshwork being gradually transferred leftward involving pleiomorphic extracellular events. A portion of the meshwork finally bridges over the left nodal crown cells in an FGFR/Shh-dependent manner. As PKD1L1 N-term is predominantly associated with Nodal on the left margin and that PKD1L1/PKD2 overexpression significantly augments cellular Nodal sensitivity, we propose that leftward transfer of polycystin-containing fibrous strands determines left-right asymmetry in developing embryos.

Abstract: Summary
GDF15 regulates its anorexic effects through the hindbrain area postrema (AP) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) neurons where its receptor, glial-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-like (GFRAL), is expressed. The actions of GDF15 may interact with other appetite regulators elevated in obesity, such as leptin. Here, we report that in mice with high-fat-diet-induced obesity (HFD), the combined infusion of GDF15 and leptin causes significantly greater weight and adiposity loss than either treatment alone, indicating potentiation between GDF15 and leptin. Furthermore, obese, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are less responsive to GDF15, as are normal mice treated with a competitive leptin antagonist. GDF15 and leptin induce more hindbrain neuronal activation in HFD mice than either treatment alone does. We report extensive connections between GFRAL- and LepR-expressing neurons and find LepR knockdown in the NTS to reduce the GDF15-mediated activation of AP neurons. Overall, these findings suggest that leptin signaling pathways in the hindbrain increase GDF15’s metabolic actions.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that facilitate cancer progression. However, our knowledge of the niches of individual TAM subsets and their development and function remain incomplete. Here, we describe a population of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1)-expressing TAMs, which form coordinated multi-cellular “nest” structures that are heterogeneously distributed proximal to vasculature in tumors of a spontaneous murine model of breast cancer. We demonstrate that LYVE-1+ TAMs develop in response to IL-6, which induces their expression of the immune-suppressive enzyme heme oxygenase-1 and promotes a CCR5-dependent signaling axis, which guides their nest formation. Blocking the development of LYVE-1+ TAMs or their nest structures, using gene-targeted mice, results in an increase in CD8+ T cell recruitment to the tumor and enhanced response to chemotherapy. This study highlights an unappreciated collaboration of a TAM subset to form a coordinated niche linked to immune exclusion and resistance to anti-cancer therapy.

Abstract: The incidence of pulmonary fibrosis is on the rise, and existing treatments have limited efficacy in improving patient survival. The purpose of this study was to reveal the potential of Krüppel-like factor (KLF)15 activation in alleviating pulmonary fibrosis. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) was utilized to induce lung fibroblasts to establish an in vitro model of pulmonary fibrosis. The impacts of TGF-β and KLF15 level on cell proliferation, migration, extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) were assessed. Additionally, tunicamycin, an ERS agonist, was used to investigate the role of ERS in KLF15 regulation. The results showed that KLF15 was dropped in response to TGF-β treatment. However, KLF15 overexpression reduced cell proliferation, migration, ECM accumulation, and ERS, alleviating the effects of TGF-β stimulation. Subsequent treatment with tunicamycin diminished the effects of KLF15 overexpression, demonstrating that ERS mediated the modulation of KLF15. KLF15 acts against ERS and suppresses excessive proliferation and ECM accumulation in lung fibroblast. These findings suggest that activating KLF15 is a promising strategy for alleviating pulmonary fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
For inoperable esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), identifying patients likely to benefit from recently approved immunochemotherapy (ICI+CTX) treatments remains a key challenge. We address this using a uniquely designed window-of-opportunity trial (LUD2015-005), in which 35 inoperable EAC patients received first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors for four weeks (ICI-4W), followed by ICI+CTX. Comprehensive biomarker profiling, including generation of a 65,000-cell single-cell RNA-sequencing atlas of esophageal cancer, as well as multi-timepoint transcriptomic profiling of EAC during ICI-4W, reveals a novel T cell inflammation signature (INCITE) whose upregulation correlates with ICI-induced tumor shrinkage. Deconvolution of pre-treatment gastro-esophageal cancer transcriptomes using our single-cell atlas identifies high tumor monocyte content (TMC) as an unexpected ICI+CTX-specific predictor of greater overall survival (OS) in LUD2015-005 patients and of ICI response in prevalent gastric cancer subtypes from independent cohorts. Tumor mutational burden is an additional independent and additive predictor of LUD2015-005 OS. TMC can improve patient selection for emerging ICI+CTX therapies in gastro-esophageal cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Perineuronal nets (PNNs) surround specific neurons in the brain and are involved in various forms of plasticity and clinical conditions. However, our understanding of the PNN role in these phenomena is limited by the lack of highly quantitative maps of PNN distribution and association with specific cell types. Here, we present a comprehensive atlas of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-positive PNNs and colocalization with parvalbumin (PV) cells for over 600 regions of the adult mouse brain. Data analysis shows that PV expression is a good predictor of PNN aggregation. In the cortex, PNNs are dramatically enriched in layer 4 of all primary sensory areas in correlation with thalamocortical input density, and their distribution mirrors intracortical connectivity patterns. Gene expression analysis identifies many PNN-correlated genes. Strikingly, PNN-anticorrelated transcripts are enriched in synaptic plasticity genes, generalizing PNNs’ role as circuit stability factors.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) are at risk of developing spatially and temporally multiple clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs), which offers a valuable opportunity to analyze inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity of genetic and immune profiles within the same patient. Here, we perform whole-exome and RNA sequencing, digital gene expression, and immunohistochemical analyses for 81 samples from 51 ccRCCs of 10 patients with vHL. Inherited ccRCCs are clonally independent and have less genomic alterations than sporadic ccRCCs. Hierarchical clustering of transcriptome profiles shows two clusters with distinct immune signatures: immune hot and cold clusters. Interestingly, not only samples from the same tumors but also different tumors from the same patients tend to show a similar immune signature, whereas samples from different patients frequently exhibit different signatures. Our findings reveal the genetic and immune landscape of inherited ccRCCs, demonstrating the relevance of host factors in shaping anti-tumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
While rhythmic contractile behavior is commonly observed at the cellular cortex, the primary focus has been on excitable or periodic events described by simple activator-delayed inhibitor mechanisms. We show that Rho GTPase activation in nocodazole-treated mitotic cells exhibits both simple oscillations and complex mixed-mode oscillations. Rho oscillations with a 20- to 30-s period are regulated by phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) via an activator-delayed inhibitor mechanism, while a slow reaction with period of minutes is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase via an activator-substrate depletion mechanism. Conversion from simple to complex oscillations can be induced by modulating PIP3 metabolism or altering membrane contact site protein E-Syt1. PTEN depletion results in a period-doubling intermediate, which, like mixed-mode oscillations, is an intermediate state toward chaos. In sum, this system operates at the edge of chaos. Small changes in phosphoinositide metabolism can confer cells with the flexibility to rapidly enter ordered states with different periodicities.

Abstract: Summary
Xenophagy is an evolutionarily conserved host defensive mechanism to eliminate invading microorganisms through autophagic machinery. The intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila can avoid clearance by the xenophagy pathway via the actions of multiple Dot/Icm effector proteins. Previous studies have shown that p62, an adaptor protein involved in xenophagy signaling, is excluded from Legionella-containing vacuoles (LCVs). Such defects are attributed to the multifunctional SidE family effectors (SidEs) that exhibit classic deubiquitinase (DUB) and phosphoribosyl ubiquitination (PR-ubiquitination) activities, yet the mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that the host DUB USP14 is PR-ubiquitinated by SidEs at multiple serine residues, which impairs its DUB activity and its interactions with p62. The exclusion of p62 from the bacterial phagosome requires the ubiquitin ligase but not the DUB activity of SidEs. These results reveal that PR-ubiquitination of USP14 by SidEs contributes to the evasion of xenophagic clearance by L. pneumophila.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is characterized by a global decline in physiological function. However, by constructing a complete single-cell gene expression atlas, we find that Caenorhabditis elegans aging is not random in nature but instead is characterized by coordinated changes in functionally related metabolic, proteostasis, and stress-response genes in a cell-type-specific fashion, with downregulation of energy metabolism being the only nearly universal change. Similarly, the rates at which cells age differ significantly between cell types. In some cell types, aging is characterized by an increase in cell-to-cell variance, whereas in others, variance actually decreases. Remarkably, multiple resilience-enhancing transcription factors known to extend lifespan are activated across many cell types with age; we discovered new longevity candidates, such as GEI-3, among these. Together, our findings suggest that cells do not age passively but instead react strongly, and individualistically, to events that occur during aging. This atlas can be queried through a public interface.

Abstract: Cervical cancer (CC) ranks the fourth in gynecologic cancers. The incidence and mortality of CC has been decreased due to the cancer screening and early treatments in recent years, but the prognosis of CC patients at advanced stage is still sorrowful. Whether PSME3 exerted a role in the radioresistance of CC cells remains to be investigated. In this study, the expression of PSME3 in mRNA and protein levels was measured by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis, and increased expression of PSME3 in CC tissues and cells was observed. CCK-8 and colony formation assay revealed that the cell viability and proliferation of Hela and CaSki cells treated with different doses of X-ray was reduced due to the depletion of PSME3, indicating that silencing of PSME3 enhanced the radiosensitivity of CC cells. In addition, repair on DNA damage in CC cells was enhanced by PSME3 and the damage was attenuated by PSME3. Besides, the expression of glycolysis-related proteins (GLUT1, PGC-1α, LDHA and HK2) were enhanced by PSME3 but reduced by silencing PSME3 in CC cells. PSME3 restraint attenuated the levels of glucose consumption and lactate production, suggesting PSME3 depletion suppressed abnormal glycolysis of CC cells. Mechanically, PSME3 increased the PARP1 expression via elevating c-myc. Finally, we observed PSME3 attenuation inhibited CC growth in vivo. In conclusion, PSME3 enhanced radioresistance and aerobic glycolysis in CC by regulating PARP1, which might shed a light into the function of PSME3 in CC treatment.

Abstract: Introduction
The incidence and mortality of gastric cancer remain high in the world. We aim to explore the role of SAMD4A in gastric cancer.
Methods
The expression of SAMD4A was up-regulated in gastric adenocarcinoma and the expression level of SAMD4A in gastric adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal tissues was verified by RT-qPCR. Immunohistochemical showed that SAMD4A was mainly located in the cytoplasm.
Result
The result showed that the expression of SAMD4A was positively correlated with the depth of invasion, the number of lymph node metastasis, and the clinical stage in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. Survival analysis of GEPIA database showed that the overall survival of gastric adenocarcinoma patients with positive SAMD4A expression was lower than that of the negative group. Gastric cancer cell lines with knockdown of the SAMD4A gene were used to observe the differences in cell proliferation, invasion, and migration abilities between the knockdown group and the control group. The results showed that the proliferation, invasion, and migration abilities of the SAMD4A knockdown group were both weakened compared with the control group. This study is the first to find that the expression level of SAMD4A in gastric cancer is higher than that in the adjacent group and is associated with poor prognosis of patients. SAMD4A promotes the proliferation, invasion, and migration of gastric adenocarcinoma cells.
Conclusion
This indicates that SAMD4A plays an important role in the occurrence and development of gastric cancer, and is expected to be an effective indicator for the diagnosis and evaluation of the prognosis of gastric cancer.

Abstract: Animals generally prefer nutrients and avoid toxic and harmful chemicals. Recent behavioral and physiological studies have identified that sweet-sensing gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in Drosophila melanogaster mediate appetitive behaviors toward fatty acids. Sweet-sensing GRN activation requires the function of the ionotropic receptors IR25a, IR56d, and IR76b, as well as the gustatory receptor GR64e. However, we reveal that hexanoic acid (HA) is toxic rather than nutritious to D. melanogaster. HA is one of the major components of the fruit Morinda citrifolia (noni). Thus, we analyzed the gustatory responses to one of major noni fatty acids, HA, via electrophysiology and proboscis extension response (PER) assay. Electrophysiological tests show this is reminiscent of arginine-mediated neuronal responses. Here, we determined that a low concentration of HA induced attraction, which was mediated by sweet-sensing GRNs, and a high concentration of HA induced aversion, which was mediated by bitter-sensing GRNs. We also demonstrated that a low concentration of HA elicits attraction mainly mediated by GR64d and IR56d expressed by sweet-sensing GRNs, but a high concentration of HA activates three gustatory receptors (GR32a, GR33a, and GR66a) expressed by bitter-sensing GRNs. The mechanism of sensing HA is biphasic in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, HA inhibit sugar-mediated activation like other bitter compounds. Taken together, we discovered a binary HA-sensing mechanism that may be evolutionarily meaningful in the foraging niche of insects.

Abstract: Summary
The proteasome plays a central role in intracellular protein degradation. Age-dependent decline in proteasome activity is associated with cellular senescence and organismal aging; however, the mechanism by which the proteasome plays a role in senescent cells remains elusive. Here, we show that nuclear foci that contain the proteasome and exhibit liquid-like properties are formed in senescent cells. The formation of senescence-associated nuclear proteasome foci (SANPs) is dependent on ubiquitination and RAD23B, similar to previously known nuclear proteasome foci, but also requires proteasome activity. RAD23B knockdown suppresses SANP formation and increases mitochondrial activity, leading to reactive oxygen species production without affecting other senescence traits such as cell-cycle arrest and cell morphology. These findings suggest that SANPs are an important feature of senescent cells and uncover a mechanism by which the proteasome plays a role in senescent cells.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we demonstrate that hypothalamic astrocytic BMAL1 computes cyclic metabolic information to optimize energetic resources in a sexually dimorphic manner. Knockdown of BMAL1 in female astrocytes leads to negative energy balance and alters basal metabolic cycles without affecting circadian locomotor activity. Thus, astrocytic BMAL1 contributes to the control of energy balance through the modulation of the metabolic rate, hepatic and white adipose tissue lipogenesis, and the activity of brown adipose tissue. Importantly, most of these alterations are specific to hypothalamic astrocytic BMAL1. Moreover, female mice with BMAL1 knockdown in astrocytes exhibited a “male-like” metabolic obese phenotype when fed a high-fat diet. Overall, our results suggest a sexually dimorphic effect of astrocytic BMAL1 on the regulation of energy homeostasis, which may be of interest in the physiopathology of obesity and related comorbidities.

Abstract: Summary
Lymphocyte priming in lymph nodes (LNs) was postulated to depend on the formation of stable T cell receptor (TCR)-specific immune synapses (ISs) with antigen (Ag)-presenting dendritic cells (DCs). The high-affinity LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1 was implicated in different ISs studied in vitro. We dissect the in vivo roles of endogenous DC ICAM-1 in Ag-stimulated T cell proliferation and differentiation and find that under type 1 polarizing conditions in vaccinated or vaccinia virus-infected skin-draining LNs, Ag-presenting DCs engage in ICAM-1-dependent stable conjugates with a subset of Ag-specific CD8 blasts. Nevertheless, in the absence of these conjugates, CD8 lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation into functional cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and skin homing effector lymphocytes takes place normally. Our results suggest that although CD8 T cell blasts engage in tight ICAM-1-dependent DC-T ISs, firm ISs are dispensable for TCR-triggered proliferation and differentiation into productive effector lymphocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Energy-dissipating adipocytes have the potential to improve metabolic health. Here, we identify hypoxia-induced gene domain protein-1a (HIGD1A), a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, as a positive regulator of adipose browning. HIGD1A is induced in thermogenic fats by cold exposure. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) transactivates HIGD1A expression synergistically with peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ coactivator α (PGC1α). HIGD1A knockdown inhibits adipocyte browning, whereas HIGD1A upregulation promotes the browning process. Mechanistically, HIGD1A deficiency impairs mitochondrial respiration to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. This increases NAD+ consumption for DNA damage repair and curtails the NAD+/NADH ratio, which inhibits sirtuin1 (SIRT1) activity, thereby compromising adipocyte browning. Conversely, overexpression of HIGD1A blunts the above process to promote adaptive thermogenesis. Furthermore, mice with HIGD1A knockdown in inguinal and brown fat have impaired thermogenesis and are prone to diet-induced obesity (DIO). Overexpression of HIGD1A favors adipose tissue browning, ultimately preventing DIO and metabolic disorders. Thus, the mitochondrial protein HIGD1A links SIRT1 activity to adipocyte browning by inhibiting ROS levels.

Abstract: Summary
Neurogenesis and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) are controlled by cell-intrinsic molecular pathways that interact with extrinsic signaling cues. In this study, we identify a circuit that regulates neurogenesis and cell proliferation in the lateral ventricle-subventricular zone (LV-SVZ). Our results demonstrate that direct glutamatergic projections from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as well as inhibitory projections from calretinin+ local interneurons, modulate the activity of cholinergic neurons in the subependymal zone (subep-ChAT+). Furthermore, in vivo optogenetic stimulation and inhibition of the ACC-subep-ChAT+ circuit are sufficient to control neurogenesis in the ventral SVZ. Both subep-ChAT+ and local calretinin+ neurons play critical roles in regulating ventral SVZ neurogenesis and LV-SVZ cell proliferation.

Abstract: Summary
The BET family protein BRD4, which forms the CDK9-containing BRD4-PTEFb complex, is considered to be a master regulator of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pause release. Because its tandem bromodomains interact with acetylated histone lysine residues, it has long been thought that BRD4 requires these bromodomains for its recruitment to chromatin and transcriptional regulatory function. Here, using rapid depletion and genetic complementation with domain deletion mutants, we demonstrate that BRD4 bromodomains are dispensable for Pol II pause release. A minimal, bromodomain-less C-terminal BRD4 fragment containing the PTEFb-interacting C-terminal motif (CTM) is instead both necessary and sufficient to mediate Pol II pause release in the absence of full-length BRD4. Although BRD4-PTEFb can associate with chromatin through acetyl recognition, our results indicate that a distinct, active BRD4-PTEFb population functions to regulate transcription independently of bromodomain-mediated chromatin association. These findings may enable more effective pharmaceutical modulation of BRD4-PTEFb activity.

Abstract: Summary
Homeostatic synaptic plasticity adjusts the strength of synapses to restrain neuronal activity within a physiological range. Postsynaptic guanylate kinase-associated protein (GKAP) controls the bidirectional synaptic scaling of AMPA receptors (AMPARs); however, mechanisms by which chronic activity triggers cytoskeletal remodeling to downscale synaptic transmission are barely understood. Here, we report that the microtubule-dependent kinesin motor Kif21b binds GKAP and likewise is located in dendritic spines in a myosin Va- and neuronal-activity-dependent manner. Kif21b depletion unexpectedly alters actin dynamics in spines, and adaptation of actin turnover following chronic activity is lost in Kif21b-knockout neurons. Consistent with a role of the kinesin in regulating actin dynamics, Kif21b overexpression promotes actin polymerization. Moreover, Kif21b controls GKAP removal from spines and the decrease of GluA2-containing AMPARs from the neuronal surface, thereby inducing homeostatic synaptic downscaling. Our data highlight a critical role of Kif21b at the synaptic actin cytoskeleton underlying homeostatic scaling of neuronal firing.

Abstract: Summary
Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) establishes lifelong infection and persists in latently infected B cells. Paradoxically, in vitro B cell infection is inefficient, and cells rapidly die, suggesting the absence of necessary factor(s). KSHV epidemiology unexpectedly mirrors that of malaria and certain helminthic infections, while other herpesviruses are ubiquitous. Elevated circulating monocytes are common in these parasitic infections. Here, we show that KSHV infection of monocytes or M-CSF-differentiated (M2) macrophages is highly efficient. Proteomic analyses demonstrate that infection induces macrophage production of B cell chemoattractants and activating factor. We find that KSHV acts with monocytes or M2 macrophages to stimulate B cell survival, proliferation, and plasmablast differentiation. Further, macrophages drive infected plasma cell differentiation and long-term viral latency. In Kenya, where KSHV is endemic, we find elevated monocyte levels in children with malaria. These findings demonstrate a role for mononuclear phagocytes in KSHV B cell latency and suggest that mononuclear phagocyte abundance may underlie KSHV’s geographic disparity.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates in human cells by interacting with host factors following infection. To understand the virus and host interactome proximity, we introduce a super-resolution proximity labeling (SR-PL) method with a “plug-and-playable” PL enzyme, TurboID-GBP (GFP-binding nanobody protein), and we apply it for interactome mapping of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and membrane protein (M), which generates highly perturbed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structures. Through SR-PL analysis of the biotinylated interactome, 224 and 272 peptides are robustly identified as ORF3a and M interactomes, respectively. Within the ORF3a interactome, RNF5 co-localizes with ORF3a and generates ubiquitin modifications of ORF3a that can be involved in protein degradation. We also observe that the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate is efficiently reduced by the overexpression of RNF5 in host cells. The interactome data obtained using the SR-PL method are presented at https://sarscov2.spatiomics.org. We hope that our method will contribute to revealing virus-host interactions of other viruses in an efficient manner.

Abstract: Summary
Elicitation of antibodies that neutralize the tier-2 neutralization-resistant isolates that typify HIV-1 transmission has been a long-sought goal. Success with prefusion-stabilized envelope trimers eliciting autologous neutralizing antibodies has been reported in multiple vaccine-test species, though not in humans. To investigate elicitation of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies in humans, here, we analyze B cells from a phase I clinical trial of the “DS-SOSIP”-stabilized envelope trimer from strain BG505, identifying two antibodies, N751-2C06.01 and N751-2C09.01 (named for donor-lineage.clone), that neutralize the autologous tier-2 strain, BG505. Though derived from distinct lineages, these antibodies form a reproducible antibody class that targets the HIV-1 fusion peptide. Both antibodies are highly strain specific, which we attribute to their partial recognition of a BG505-specific glycan hole and to their binding requirements for a few BG505-specific residues. Prefusion-stabilized envelope trimers can thus elicit autologous tier-2 neutralizing antibodies in humans, with initially identified neutralizing antibodies recognizing the fusion-peptide site of vulnerability.

Abstract: Summary
Circular RNAs are generated by backsplicing and control cellular signaling and phenotypes. Pericytes stabilize capillary structures and play important roles in the formation and maintenance of blood vessels. Here, we characterize hypoxia-regulated circular RNAs (circRNAs) in human pericytes and show that the circular RNA of procollagen-lysine,2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase-2 (circPLOD2) is induced by hypoxia and regulates pericyte functions. Silencing of circPLOD2 affects pericytes and increases proliferation, migration, and secretion of soluble angiogenic proteins, thereby enhancing endothelial migration and network capability. Transcriptional and epigenomic profiling of circPLOD2-depleted cells reveals widespread changes in gene expression and identifies the transcription factor krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) as a key effector of the circPLOD2-mediated changes. KLF4 depletion mimics circPLOD2 silencing, whereas KLF4 overexpression reverses the effects of circPLOD2 depletion on proliferation and endothelial-pericyte interactions. Together, these data reveal an important function of circPLOD2 in controlling pericyte proliferation and capillary formation and show that the circPLOD2-mediated regulation of KLF4 significantly contributes to the transcriptional response to hypoxia.

Abstract: One of the biggest factors that negatively affect the cancer treatment plan is the toxic effects of chemotherapeutics on non-target cells and tissues. This information prompted us to investigate the protective effects of silymarin (SL), a hepatoprotective agent, against the hepatotoxic effects of the anticancer drug paclitaxel (PAC). Four groups were formed from 28 rats as control, PAC (2 mg/kg), SL (100 mg/kg) and PAC + SL (combination of PAC with SL). After completing the experimental procedures, the tissues collected after anesthesia were analyzed by Western blot, qRT-PCR, biochemical, stereological, immunohistochemical, and histopathological techniques. Administration of PAC significantly increased the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), Bax, cytochrome-c (cyt-c), and active caspase-3, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in liver tissue and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels compared with the control group. PAC also resulted in a significant increase in serum triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (CH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels compared with the control group. Pathological changes such as microvesicular steatosis, the formation of Councilman bodies, an increase in total sinusoidal volume, and a decrease in the total number of hepatocytes were observed in the liver tissue of the PAC group. Almost all analysis results in the PAC + SL group were similar to those in the control group, and no significant pathological alterations were observed in this group. The data obtained show that SL protects the liver from the harmful effects of PAC, especially thanks to its TNF-α suppressor, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and antioxidant effects. Based on this result, in cases where PAC is used in cancer treatment, it can be recommended to be used together with SL to prevent harmful effects on healthy liver tissue and to continue treatment uninterruptedly and effectively.

Abstract: Lipofuscins are oxidized lipid and protein complexes that accumulate during cellular senescence and tissue aging, regarded as markers for cellular oxidative damage, tissue aging, and certain aging-associated diseases. Therefore, understanding their cellular biological properties is crucial for effective treatment development. Through traditional microscopy, lipofuscins are readily observed as fluorescent granules thought to accumulate in lysosomes. However, lipofuscin granule formation and accumulation in senescent cells are poorly understood. Thus, this study examined lipofuscin accumulation in human fibroblasts exposed to various stressors. Our results substantiate that in glucose-starved or replicative senescence cells, where elevated oxidative stress levels activate autophagy, lipofuscins predominately appear as granules that co-localize with autolysosomes due to lysosomal acidity or impairment. Meanwhile, autophagosome formation is attenuated in cells experiencing oxidative stress induced by a doxorubicin pulse and chase, and lipofuscin fluorescence granules seldom manifest in the cytoplasm. As Torin-1 treatment activates autophagy, granular lipofuscins intensify and dominate, indicating that autophagy activation triggers their accumulation. Our results suggest that high oxidative stress activates autophagy but fails in lipofuscin removal, leaving an abundance of lipofuscin-filled impaired autolysosomes, referred to as residual bodies. Therefore, future endeavors in treating lipofuscin pathology-associated diseases and dysfunctions through autophagy activation demand meticulous consideration.

Abstract: Summary
Planar spindle orientation is critical for epithelial tissue organization and is generally instructed by the long cell-shape axis or cortical polarity domains. We introduced mouse intestinal organoids in order to study spindle orientation in a monolayered mammalian epithelium. Although spindles were planar, mitotic cells remained elongated along the apico-basal (A-B) axis, and polarity complexes were segregated to basal poles, so that spindles oriented in an unconventional manner, orthogonal to both polarity and geometric cues. Using high-resolution 3D imaging, simulations, and cell-shape and cytoskeleton manipulations, we show that planar divisions resulted from a length limitation in astral microtubules (MTs) which precludes them from interacting with basal polarity, and orient spindles from the local geometry of apical domains. Accordingly, lengthening MTs affected spindle planarity, cell positioning, and crypt arrangement. We conclude that MT length regulation may serve as a key mechanism for spindles to sense local cell shapes and tissue forces to preserve mammalian epithelial architecture.

Abstract: Summary
The 26S proteasome comprises 20S catalytic and 19S regulatory complexes. Approximately half of the proteasomes in cells exist as free 20S complexes; however, our mechanistic understanding of what determines the ratio of 26S to 20S species remains incomplete. Here, we show that glucose starvation uncouples 26S holoenzymes into 20S and 19S subcomplexes. Subcomplex affinity purification and quantitative mass spectrometry reveal that Ecm29 proteasome adaptor and scaffold (ECPAS) mediates this structural remodeling. The loss of ECPAS abrogates 26S dissociation, reducing degradation of 20S proteasome substrates, including puromycylated polypeptides. In silico modeling suggests that ECPAS conformational changes commence the disassembly process. ECPAS is also essential for endoplasmic reticulum stress response and cell survival during glucose starvation. In vivo xenograft model analysis reveals elevated 20S proteasome levels in glucose-deprived tumors. Our results demonstrate that the 20S-19S disassembly is a mechanism adapting global proteolysis to physiological needs and countering proteotoxic stress.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated mesothelial cells (CAMCs) in the tumor microenvironment are thought to promote growth and immune evasion. We find that, in mouse and human ovarian tumors, cancer cells express anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) while CAMCs express its receptor AMHR2, suggesting a paracrine axis. Factors secreted by cancer cells induce AMHR2 expression during their reprogramming into CAMCs in mouse and human in vitro models. Overexpression of AMHR2 in the Met5a mesothelial cell line is sufficient to induce expression of immunosuppressive cytokines and growth factors that stimulate ovarian cancer cell growth in an AMH-dependent way. Finally, syngeneic cancer cells implanted in transgenic mice with Amhr2−/− CAMCs grow significantly slower than in wild-type hosts. The cytokine profile of Amhr2−/− tumor-bearing mice is altered and their tumors express less immune checkpoint markers programmed-cell-death 1 (PD1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4). Taken together, these data suggest that the AMH/AMHR2 axis plays a critical role in regulating the pro-tumoral function of CAMCs in ovarian cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity contributes substantially to the global burden of disease and has a significant heritable component. Recent large-scale exome sequencing studies identified several genes in which rare, protein-coding variants have large effects on adult body mass index (BMI). Here we extended such work by performing sex-stratified associations in the UK Biobank study (N∼420,000). We identified genes in which rare heterozygous loss-of-function increases adult BMI in women (DIDO1, PTPRG, and SLC12A5) and in men (SLTM), with effect sizes up to ∼8 kg/m2. This is complemented by analyses implicating rare variants in OBSCN and MADD for recalled childhood adiposity. The known functions of these genes, as well as findings of common variant genome-wide pathway enrichment analyses, suggest a role for neuron death, apoptosis, and DNA damage response mechanisms in the susceptibility to obesity across the life-course. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex-specific and life-course effects in the genetic regulation of obesity.

Abstract: Summary
As highly organized consortia of bacteria, biofilms have long been implicated in aggravating inflammation. However, our understanding regarding in vivo host-biofilm interactions in the complex tissue environments remains limited. Here, we show a unique pattern of crypt occupation by mucus-associated biofilms during the early stage of colitis, which is genetically dependent on bacterial biofilm-forming capacity and restricted by host epithelial α1,2-fucosylation. α1,2-Fucosylation deficiency leads to markedly augmented crypt occupation by biofilms originated from pathogenic Salmonella Typhimurium or indigenous Escherichia coli, resulting in exacerbated intestinal inflammation. Mechanistically, α1,2-fucosylation-mediated restriction of biofilms relies on interactions between bacteria and liberated fucose from biofilm-occupied mucus. Fucose represses biofilm formation and biofilm-related genes in vitro and in vivo. Finally, fucose administration ameliorates experimental colitis, suggesting therapeutic potential of fucose for biofilm-related disorders. This work illustrates host-biofilm interactions during gut inflammation and identifies fucosylation as a physiological strategy for restraining biofilm formation.

Abstract: Summary
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) maintains an oxidative redox environment that is advantageous for the oxidative folding of nascent polypeptides entering the ER. Reductive reactions within the ER are also crucial for maintaining ER homeostasis. However, the mechanism by which electrons are supplied for the reductase activity within the ER remains unknown. Here, we identify ER oxidoreductin-1α (Ero1α) as an electron donor for ERdj5, an ER-resident disulfide reductase. During oxidative folding, Ero1α catalyzes disulfide formation in nascent polypeptides through protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and then transfers the electrons to molecular oxygen via flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), ultimately yielding hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Besides this canonical electron pathway, we reveal that ERdj5 accepts electrons from specific cysteine pairs in Ero1α, demonstrating that the oxidative folding of nascent polypeptides provides electrons for reductive reactions in the ER. Moreover, this electron transfer pathway also contributes to maintaining ER homeostasis by reducing H2O2 production in the ER.

Abstract: Summary
Protein products of essential genes, indispensable for organismal survival, are highly conserved and bring about fundamental functions. Interestingly, proteins that contain amino acid homorepeats that tend to evolve rapidly are enriched in eukaryotic essentialomes. Why are proteins with hypermutable homorepeats enriched in conserved and functionally vital essential proteins? We solve this functional versus evolutionary paradox by demonstrating that human essential proteins with homorepeats bring about crosstalk across biological processes through high interactability and have distinct regulatory functions affecting expansive global regulation. Importantly, essential proteins with homorepeats rapidly diverge with the amino acid substitutions frequently affecting functional sites, likely facilitating rapid adaptability. Strikingly, essential proteins with homorepeats influence human-specific embryonic and brain development, implying that the presence of homorepeats could contribute to the emergence of human-specific processes. Thus, we propose that homorepeat-containing essential proteins affecting species-specific traits can be potential intervention targets across pathologies, including cancers and neurological disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Neuraminidase is suggested as an important component for developing a universal influenza vaccine. Targeted induction of neuraminidase-specific broadly protective antibodies by vaccinations is challenging. To overcome this, we rationally select the highly conserved peptides from the consensus amino acid sequence of the globular head domains of neuraminidase. Inspired by the B cell receptor evolution process, a reliable sequential immunization regimen is designed to result in immuno-focusing by steering bulk immune responses to a selected region where broadly protective B lymphocyte epitopes reside. After priming neuraminidase protein-specific antibody responses in C57BL/6 or BALB/c inbred mice strains by immunization or pre-infection, boost immunizations with certain neuraminidase-derived peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates significantly strengthened serum neuraminidase inhibition activities and cross-protections. Overall, this study provides proof of concept for a peptide-based sequential immunization strategy for achieving targeted induction of cross-protective antibody response, which provides references for designing universal vaccines against other highly variable pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying molecular circuits that control adipose tissue macrophage (ATM) function is necessary to understand how ATMs contribute to tissue homeostasis and obesity-induced insulin resistance. In this study, we find that mice with a myeloid-specific knockout of the miR-23-27-24 clusters of microRNAs (miRNAs) gain less weight on a high-fat diet but exhibit worsened glucose and insulin tolerance. Analysis of ATMs from these mice shows selectively reduced numbers and proliferation of a recently reported subset of lipid-associated CD9+Trem2+ ATMs (lipid-associated macrophages [LAMs]). Leveraging the role of miRNAs to control networks of genes, we use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), functional screens, and biochemical assays to identify candidate target transcripts that regulate proliferation-associated signaling. We determine that miR-23 directly targets the mRNA of Eif4ebp2, a gene that restricts protein synthesis and proliferation in macrophages. Altogether, our study demonstrates that control of proliferation of a protective subset of LAMs by noncoding RNAs contributes to protection against diet-induced obesity metabolic dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
The regulatory effect of non-coding large-scale structural variations (SVs) on proto-oncogene activation remains unclear. This study investigated SV-mediated gene dysregulation by profiling 3D cancer genome maps from 40 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). We developed a machine learning-based method for spatial characterization of the altered 3D cancer genome. This revealed a frequent establishment of “de novo chromatin contacts” that can span multiple topologically associating domains (TADs) in addition to the canonical TAD fusion/shuffle model. Using this information, we precisely identified super-enhancer (SE)-hijacking and its clonal characteristics. Clonal SE-hijacking genes, such as TOP2B, are recurrently associated with cell-cycle/DNA-processing functions, which can potentially be used as CRC prognostic markers. Oncogene activation and increased drug resistance due to SE-hijacking were validated by reconstructing the patient’s SV using CRISPR-Cas9. Collectively, the spatial and clonality-resolved analysis of the 3D cancer genome reveals regulatory principles of large-scale SVs in oncogene activation and their clinical implications.

Abstract: Summary
Cytokinesis relies on membrane trafficking pathways regulated by Rabs and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). During cytokinesis, the intercellular cytokinetic bridge (ICB) connecting daughter cells undergoes abscission, which requires actin depolymerization. Rab35 recruits MICAL1 to oxidize and depolymerize actin filaments. We show that DENND2B, a protein linked to cancer and congenital disorders, functions as a Rab35 GEF, recruiting and activating Rab35 at the ICB. DENND2B’s N-terminal region also interacts with an active form of Rab35, suggesting that DENND2B is both a Rab35 GEF and effector. Knockdown of DENND2B delays abscission, leading to multinucleated cells and filamentous actin (F-actin) accumulation at the ICB, impairing recruitment of ESCRT-III at the abscission site. Additionally, F-actin accumulation triggers the formation of a chromatin bridge, activating the NoCut/abscission checkpoint, and DENND2B knockdown activates Aurora B kinase, a hallmark of checkpoint activation. Thus, our study identifies DENND2B as a crucial player in cytokinetic abscission.

Abstract: Summary
The stability of eukaryotic genomes relies on the faithful transmission of DNA sequences and the maintenance of chromatin states through DNA replication. Plant TONSOKU (TSK) and its animal ortholog TONSOKU-like (TONSL) act as readers for newly synthesized histones and preserve DNA integrity via facilitating DNA repair at post-replicative chromatin. However, whether TSK/TONSL regulate the maintenance of chromatin states remains elusive. Here, we show that TSK is dispensable for global histone and nucleosome accumulation but necessary for maintaining repressive chromatin modifications, including H3K9me2, H2A.W, H3K27me3, and DNA methylation. TSK physically interacts with H3K9 methyltransferases and Polycomb proteins. Moreover, TSK mutation strongly enhances defects in Polycomb pathway mutants. TSK is intended to only associate with nascent chromatin until it starts to mature. We propose that TSK ensures the preservation of chromatin states by supporting the recruitment of chromatin modifiers to post-replicative chromatin in a critical short window of time following DNA replication.

Abstract: Cysteine proteases orchestrate bone remodeling, and are inhibited by cystatins. In reinforcing our hypothesis that exogenous and naturally obtained inhibitors of cysteine proteases (cystatins) act on bone remodeling, we decided to challenge osteoblasts with sugarcane-derived cystatin (CaneCPI-5) for up to 7 days. To this end, we investigated molecular issues related to the decisive, preliminary stages of osteoblast biology, such as adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Our data showed that CaneCPI-5 negatively modulates both cofilin phosphorylation at Ser03, and the increase in cytoskeleton remodeling during the adhesion mechanism, possibly as a prerequisite to controlling cell proliferation and migration. This is mainly because CaneCPI-5 also caused the overexpression of the CDK2 gene, and greater migration of osteoblasts. Extracellular matrix remodeling was also evaluated in this study by investigating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities. Our data showed that CaneCPI-5 overstimulates both MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, and suggested that this cellular event could be related to osteoblast differentiation. Additionally, differentiation mechanisms were better evaluated by investigating Osterix and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) genes, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling members. Altogether, our data showed that CaneCPI-5 can trigger biological mechanisms related to osteoblast differentiation, and broaden the perspectives for better exploring biotechnological approaches for bone disorders.

Abstract: Summary
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) control RNA metabolism to orchestrate gene expression and, when dysfunctional, underlie human diseases. Proteome-wide discovery efforts predict thousands of RBP candidates, many of which lack canonical RNA-binding domains (RBDs). Here, we present a hybrid ensemble RBP classifier (HydRA), which leverages information from both intermolecular protein interactions and internal protein sequence patterns to predict RNA-binding capacity with unparalleled specificity and sensitivity using support vector machines (SVMs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformer-based protein language models. Occlusion mapping by HydRA robustly detects known RBDs and predicts hundreds of uncharacterized RNA-binding associated domains. Enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) for HydRA-predicted RBP candidates reveals transcriptome-wide RNA targets and confirms RNA-binding activity for HydRA-predicted RNA-binding associated domains. HydRA accelerates construction of a comprehensive RBP catalog and expands the diversity of RNA-binding associated domains.

Abstract: Summary
Maternal-offspring interactions in mammals involve both cooperation and conflict. The fetus has evolved ways to manipulate maternal physiology to enhance placental nutrient transfer, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. The imprinted Igf2 gene is highly expressed in murine placental endocrine cells. Here, we show that Igf2 deletion in these cells impairs placental endocrine signaling to the mother, without affecting placental morphology. Igf2 controls placental hormone production, including prolactins, and is crucial to establish pregnancy-related insulin resistance and to partition nutrients to the fetus. Consequently, fetuses lacking placental endocrine Igf2 are growth restricted and hypoglycemic. Mechanistically, Igf2 controls protein synthesis and cellular energy homeostasis, actions dependent on the placental endocrine cell type. Igf2 loss also has additional long-lasting effects on offspring metabolism in adulthood. Our study provides compelling evidence for an intrinsic fetal manipulation system operating in placenta that modifies maternal metabolism and fetal resource allocation, with long-term consequences for offspring metabolic health.

Abstract: Summary
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by dengue virus (DENV), a member of the flaviviruses. The DENV genome is a 5′-capped positive-sense RNA with a unique 5′-stem-loop structure (SLA), which is essential for RNA replication and 5′ capping. The virus-encoded proteins NS5 and NS3 are responsible for viral genome replication, but the structural basis by which they cooperatively conduct the required tasks has remained unclear. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of SLA-bound NS5 (PC), NS3-bound PC (PC-NS3), and an RNA-elongating NS5-NS3 complex (EC). While SLA bridges the NS5 methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains in PC, the NS3 helicase domain displaces it in elongation complex (EC). The SLA- and NS3-binding sites overlap with that of human STAT2. These structures illuminate the key steps in DENV genome replication, namely, SLA-dependent replication initiation, processive RNA elongation, and 5′ capping of the nascent genomic RNA, thereby providing foundations to combat flaviviruses.

Abstract: Summary
Wnt signaling orchestrates gene expression via its effector, β-catenin. However, it is unknown whether β-catenin binds its target genomic regions simultaneously and how this impacts chromatin dynamics to modulate cell behavior. Using a combination of time-resolved CUT&RUN against β-catenin, ATAC-seq, and perturbation assays in different cell types, we show that Wnt/β-catenin physical targets are tissue-specific, β-catenin “moves” on different loci over time, and its association to DNA accompanies changing chromatin accessibility landscapes that determine cell behavior. In particular, Wnt/β-catenin progressively shapes the chromatin of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as they undergo mesodermal differentiation, a behavior that we define as “plastic.” In HEK293T cells, on the other hand, Wnt/β-catenin drives a transient chromatin opening, followed by re-establishment of the pre-stimulation state, a response that we define as “elastic.” Future experiments shall assess whether other cell communication mechanisms, in addition to Wnt signaling, are ruled by time, cellular idiosyncrasies, and chromatin constraints. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Protective immunity following vaccination is sustained by long-lived antibody-secreting cells and resting memory B cells (MBCs). Responses to two-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccination are evaluated longitudinally by multimodal single-cell analysis in three infection-naïve individuals. Integrated surface protein, transcriptomics, and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire analysis of sorted plasmablasts and spike+ (S-2P+) and S-2P− B cells reveal clonal expansion and accumulating mutations among S-2P+ cells. These cells are enriched in a cluster of immunoglobulin G-expressing MBCs and evolve along a bifurcated trajectory rooted in CXCR3+ MBCs. One branch leads to CD11c+ atypical MBCs while the other develops from CD71+ activated precursors to resting MBCs, the dominant population at month 6. Among 12 evolving S-2P+ clones, several are populated with plasmablasts at early timepoints as well as CD71+ activated and resting MBCs at later timepoints, and display intra- and/or inter-cohort BCR convergence. These relationships suggest a coordinated and predictable evolution of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-generated MBCs.
