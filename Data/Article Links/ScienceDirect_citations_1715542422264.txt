Abstract: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) controls lipid homeostasis through regulation of lipid transport and catabolism. PPARα activators are clinically used for hyperlipidemia treatment. The role of PPARα in bile acid (BA) homeostasis is beginning to emerge. Herein, Ppara-null and hepatocyte-specific Ppara-null (Ppara∆Hep) as well as the respective wild-type mice were treated with the potent PPARα agonist Wy-14,643 (Wy) and global metabolomics performed to clarify the role of hepatocyte PPARα in the regulation of BA homeostasis. Levels of all serum BAs were markedly elevated in Wy-treated wild-type mice but not in Ppara-null and Ppara∆Hep mice. Gene expression analysis showed that PPARα activation (1) down-regulated the expression of sodium-taurocholate acid transporting polypeptide and organic ion transporting polypeptide 1 and 4, responsible for the uptake of BAs into the liver; (2) decreased the expression of bile salt export pump transporting BA from hepatocytes into the bile canaliculus; (3) upregulated the expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 and 4 transporting BA from hepatocytes into the portal vein. Moreover, there was a notable increase in the compositions of serum, hepatic and biliary cholic acid and taurocholic acid following Wy treatment, which correlated with the upregulated expression of the Cyp8b1 gene encoding sterol 12α-hydroxylase. The effects of Wy were identical between the Ppara∆Hep and Ppara-null mice. Hepatocyte PPARα controlled BA synthesis and transport not only via direct transcriptional regulation but also via crosstalk with hepatic farnesoid X receptor signaling. These findings underscore a key role for hepatocyte PPARα in the control of BA homeostasis.

Abstract: Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is a fatal neurovisceral disease for which there are no FDA approved treatments, though cyclodextrin (HPβCD) slows disease progression in preclinical models and in an early phase clinical trial. Our goal was to evaluate the mechanism of action of a previously described combination-therapy, Triple Combination Formulation (TCF) – comprised of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat/HPβCD/PEG – shown to prolong survival in Npc1 mice. In these studies, TCF's benefit was attributed to enhanced vorinostat pharmacokinetics (PK). Here, we show that TCF reduced lipid storage, extended lifespan, and preserved neurological function in Npc1 mice. Unexpectedly, substitution of an inactive analog for vorinostat in TCF revealed similar efficacy. We demonstrate that the efficacy of TCF was attributable to enhanced HPβCD PK and independent of NPC1 protein expression. We conclude that although HDACi effectively reduce cholesterol storage in NPC1-deficient cells, HDACi are ineffective in vivo in Npc1 mice.

Gene identification and functional characterization of a Δ12 fatty acid desaturase in Tetrahymena thermophila and its influence in homeoviscous adaptation to low temperature,

Abstract: Homeoviscous adaptation in poikilotherms is based in the regulation of the level of desaturation of fatty acids, variation in phospholipids head groups and sterol content in the membrane lipids, in order to maintain the membrane fluidity in response to changes in environmental temperature. Increased proportion of unsaturated fatty acids is thought to be the main response to low-temperature acclimation, which is mostly achieved by fatty acid desaturases. Genome analysis of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and a gene knockout approach has allowed us to identify one Δ12 FAD and to study its activity in the original host and in a yeast heterologous expression system. The “PUFA index” -relative content of polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to the sum of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid content- was ~57% lower at 15 °C and 35 °C in the Δ12 FAD gene knockout strain (KOΔ12) compared to WT strain. We characterized the role of T. thermophila Δ12 FAD on homeoviscous adaptation and analyzed its involvement in cellular growth, cold stress response, and membrane fluidity, as well as its expression pattern during temperature shifts. Although these alterations allowed normal growth in the KOΔ12 strain at 30 °C or higher temperatures, growth was impaired at temperatures of 20 °C or lower, where homeoviscous adaptation is impaired. These results stress the importance of Δ12 FAD in the regulation of cold adaptation processes, as well as the suitability of T. thermophila as a valuable model to investigate the regulation of membrane lipids and evolutionary conservation and divergence of the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest a potential role of bioactive lipids in acute kidney injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The current study was designed to determine the profiling activities of various polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolizing enzymes, including lipoxygenases (LO), cyclooxygenase, and cytochrome P450 in the plasma of LPS-injected mice using LC-MS. Heat map analysis revealed that out of 126 bioactive lipids screened, only the 12/15-LO metabolite, 12-HETE, had a significant (2.24 ± 0.4) fold increase relative to control (P = 0.0001) after Bonferroni Correction (BCF α = 0.003). We then determined the role of the 12/15-LO in LPS-induced acute kidney injury using genetic and pharmacological approaches. Treatment of LPS injected mice with the 12/15-LO inhibitor, baicalein, significantly reduced levels of renal injury and inflammation markers including urinary thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARs), urinary monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), renal interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Similarly, knocking-out of 12/15-LO reduced levels of renal inflammation and injury markers elicited by LPS injection. Next, we tested whether exogenous supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as a substrate would divert the role of 12/15-LO from being pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory via increased production of the anti-inflammatory metabolite. DHA treatment restored the decreased in plasma level of resolvin D2 (RvD2) and reduced renal injury in LPS-injected mice whereas DHA treatment failed to provide any synergistic effects in reducing renal injury in LPS injected 12/15-LO knock-out mice. The ability of RvD2 to protect kidney against LPS-induced renal injury was further confirmed by exogenous RvD2 which significantly reduced the elevation in renal injury in LPS injected mice. These data suggest a double-edged sword role of 12/15-LO in LPS-induced acute renal inflammation and injury, depending on the type of substrate available for its activity.

MicroRNA-425 controls lipogenesis and lipolysis in adipocytes,

Abstract: An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that some microRNAs participate in the regulation of growth and development of adipocytes. The present study shows that microRNA-425-5p (miR-425) is a novel strong regulator of adipogenesis and adipolysis in adipocytes. Forced expression of miR-425 in mice promoted body fat accumulation and the development of obesity due to high-fat intake, whereas silencing miR-425 prevented mice from being obese. Mechanically, the expression of miR-425 is controlled by PPARγ during the adipogenesis process in adipocytes. MiR-425 overexpression resulted in a reduction in the proliferation of 3t3-L1 pre-adipocytes but significantly accelerated cellular adipogenic differentiation. Mapk14, a negative regulator of adipogenesis, was predicted and confirmed as a real target gene of miR-425. Moreover, knocking down miR-425 remarkably intensified intracellular lipolysis and promoted lipid oxidation, which is related to the activation of AMPK, a monitor for intracellular energy balance. MiR-425 activated AMPK not only by decreasing cellular ATP concentrations but also by targeting the gene of Cab39, which is an upstream co-activator of AMPK. The findings of the present study suggest that miR-425 could control adipogenesis and adipolysis in adipocytes by simultaneously triggering multidirectional targets.

Abstract: Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) plays a key role in nonshivering thermogenesis and is involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. In a previous study, we generated adipocyte-specific UCP1 knock-in (UCP1-KI) pigs, which exhibited improved thermoregulatory ability and decreased fat deposition. To investigate whether UCP1 knock-in alters the lipid composition of adipose tissues, lipidomics of inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (iWAT) and backfat from 6-month-old cold-treated UCP1-KI pigs and wild-type (WT) pigs were profiled. In addition, genome-wide RNA-sequencing of iWAT was performed to further study the genetic basis for lipid alterations. The results showed that iWAT and backfat from UCP1-KI pigs exhibited distinct lipidomic profiles, as the mild lipid alteration was observed in backfat of UCP1 knock-in pigs. Inguinal WAT from UCP1-KI pigs contained significantly decreased total triacylglycerol (p < 0.05), together with the downregulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, suggesting the decreased lipogenesis in iWAT of UCP1-KI pigs. Significantly increased levels of total sphingolipids (p<0.05) were also observed in iWAT from UCP1-KI pigs. Notably, two mitochondrial-specific lipid species, cardiolipin CL72:8 (18:2) and CL74:9 (18:2), were found to be dramatically increased in iWAT from UCP1-KI pigs, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial function. This observation was further supported by the significant upregulation of numerous mitochondrial-related genes and significantly increased number of large mitochondria and mitochondrial cristae in iWAT of UCP1-KI pigs. Taken together, these data illustrate the specific role of UCP1 in lipid metabolism of fat tissues in pigs and provide new data for characterization of fat traits in UCP1-KI pigs.

Abstract: As an unusual economically important aquaculture species, Sinonovacula constricta possesses high levels of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). Previously, our group identified fatty acyl desaturases (Fad) with Δ5 and Δ6 activities in S. constricta, which was the first report of Δ6 Fad in a marine mollusc. Here, we further successfully characterize elongases of very long-chain fatty acids (Elovl) in this important bivalve species, including one Elovl2/5, two Elovl4 isoforms (a and b) and a novel Elovl (c) with Elovl4 activity. In addition, we also determined the desaturation activity of S. constricta Δ6 Fad toward 24:5n-3 to give 24:6n-3, a key intermediate in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) biosynthesis. Therefore, S. constricta is the first marine mollusc reported to possess all Fad and Elovl activities required for LC-PUFA biosynthesis via the ‘Sprecher pathway’. This finding greatly increases our understanding of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in marine molluscs. Phylogenetic analysis by interrogating six marine molluscan genomes, and previously functionally characterized Elovl and Fad from marine molluscs, suggested that DHA biosynthetic ability was limited to a few species, due to the general lack of Δ4 or Δ6 Fad in most molluscs.

Grab recruitment by Rab27A-Rabphilin3a triggers Rab3A activation in human sperm exocytosis,

Abstract: Sperm must undergo the regulated exocytosis of its dense core granule (the acrosome reaction, AR) to fertilize the egg. We have previously described that Rabs3 and 27 are organized in a RabGEF cascade within the signaling pathway elicited by exocytosis stimuli in human sperm. Here, we report the identity and the role of two molecules that link these secretory Rabs in the RabGEF cascade: Rabphilin3a and GRAB. Like Rab3 and Rab27, GRAB and Rabphilin3a are present, localize to the acrosomal region and are required for calcium-triggered exocytosis in human sperm. Sequestration of either protein with specific antibodies introduced into streptolysin O-permeabilized sperm impairs the activation of Rab3 in the acrosomal region elicited by calcium, but not that of Rab27. Biochemical and functional assays indicate that Rabphilin3a behaves as a Rab27 effector during the AR and that GRAB exhibits GEF activity toward Rab3A. Recombinant, active Rab27A pulls down Rabphilin3a and GRAB from human sperm extracts. Conversely, immobilized Rabphilin3a recruits Rab27 and GRAB; the latter promotes Rab3A activation. The enzymatic activity of GRAB toward Rab3A was also suggested by in silico and in vitro assays with purified proteins. In summary, we describe here a signaling module where Rab27A-GTP interacts with Rabphilin3a, which in turn recruits a guanine nucleotide-exchange activity toward Rab3A. This is the first description of the interaction of Rabphilin3a with a GEF. Because the machinery that drives exocytosis is highly conserved, it is tempting to hypothesize that the RabGEF cascade unveiled here might be part of the molecular mechanisms that drive exocytosis in other secretory systems.

Abstract: Circadian clocks coordinate physiological and behavioral rhythms that allow the organism to anticipate and adapt to daily changes in environment. The clock-driven cellular oscillations are highly tissue specific to efficiently fine-tune local signaling, manage energy use and segregate incompatible processes. In most peripheral tissues, food acts as the main cue that entrains the oscillations to external time. Food intake and energy balance are under control of endocannabinoid (EC) signaling. Despite this obvious link between the circadian and EC systems, evidence for their interaction started to emerge only recently. We used targeted lipidomics to analyze circadian variations in EC tone in rat plasma, liver and adrenal tissue. The results provide the evidence that ECs, monoacylglycerols, N-acylethanolamines and their precursors oscillate with a tissue-specific circadian phase in plasma and liver. We then identified a set of rhythmically expressed genes likely responsible for the variations in EC tissue tone. In contrast to the liver, EC levels did not oscillate in the adrenal glands. Instead, we revealed that local EC receptor genes are under circadian regulation. To explore the impact of metabolic signals on expression of these genes, we used daytime-restricted feeding schedule. We subsequently showed that daytime feeding strongly suppressed liver-expressed fatty acid binding protein 5 (Fabp5) and adrenal-expressed non-canonical endocannabinoid receptors Gpr55 and Trpv1, whereas it upregulated liver-expressed Trpv1 and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 1 (Gde1). Our results reveal tissue-specific mechanisms involved in interaction between endocannabinoid signaling, circadian system and metabolism.

Abstract: In the metabolism of pulmonary surfactant, the ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 3 (ABCA3) is a crucial protein in the formation of the storage compartment for surfactant, the lamellar body (LB), and the transport of phospholipids in it. Mutations in ABCA3 not only disturb surfactant metabolism but also cause chronic interstitial lung diseases. Assays for ABCA3 transport function are needed to investigate pathophysiology of the mutations and treatment options for the patients. We metabolically labeled choline (Cho) head phospholipids with the Cho analogue, propargyl-Cho. The universal incorporation of propargyl-Cho was confirmed by mass spectrometry and labeled lipids were visualized in confocal microscopy by click reaction with an azide fluorophore. After pulse-labeling propargyl-Cho labeled lipids accumulated in ABCA3+ vesicles in a time and concentration dependent manner. When treated with the choline kinase inhibitor MN58b during the first 12 h, the lipids intensity inside ABCA3+ vesicles decreased, whereas intensity was unchanged when treated after 12 h. Miltefosine, a substrate of ABCA3, decreased the incorporation of labeled lipids in ABCA3+ vesicles at all time points. The lipids intensity inside the mutated (p.N568D or p.L1580P) ABCA3+ vesicles was decreased compared to wild type, while the intensity outside of vesicles showed no difference. Propargyl-Cho can metabolically pulse-label Cho phospholipids. Visualization and quantification of fluorescence intensity of the labeled lipids inside ABCA3+ vesicles at equilibrium can specifically assess the transport function of ABCA3.

Abstract: Organisms use various adaptive strategies against phosphate stress, including lipid remodeling. Here, the response of major membrane lipids to phosphate stress was analyzed in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. Unlike plants and eukaryotic microalgae, no significant increases in neutral lipids were found, whereas glycolipids content increased to as high as 6.13% (of dry cell weight, DCW) and phospholipids decreased to 0.34% (of DCW) after 16 days of cultivation without phosphate. Glycolipids accumulation were mainly attributed to the significant increase of digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) by 50% and sulfoquinovosyldiaclglycerol (SQDG) by 90%, both of which acted as complementary lipids for phosphatidylglycerol (PG) in the cyanobacterial membrane. Also, a notable increase in content (by 48%) of C18 fatty acids (especially C18:1) was observed in all glycolipids at the expense of C12 and C14 (72%). These changes may contribute to membrane fluidity and photosynthetic activity for basic cell metabolism and phosphate stress adaptation. Lipidomic analyses showed the reduction of PG 18:1/16: 0 (by 52%) with the increase of DGDG 18:1/16:0 (133%) and SQDG 18:1/16:0 (245%), strongly suggesting a direct conversion of PG to DGDG and SQDG. Moreover, the decreasing amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) 16:1/16:0 (22%) was consistent with the increase of free fatty acids (125%) on day 2 of phosphate absence, which suggested that MGDG is more likely to provide a pool of fatty acids for de novo synthesis of glycolipids. This study provides valuable insight into cyanobacteria adaptation strategies to phosphate stress by membrane lipid remodeling and unveils the underlying acyl chain fluxes into glycolipids.

Abstract: The sphingolipid ceramide regulates beta-oxidation of medium and long chain fatty acids in mitochondria. It is not known whether it also regulates oxidation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in peroxisomes. Using affinity chromatography, co-immunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays we discovered that ceramide interacts with Hsd17b4, an enzyme critical for peroxisomal VLCFA oxidation and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) generation. Immunocytochemistry showed that Hsd17b4 is distributed to ceramide-enriched mitochondria-associated membranes (CEMAMs). Molecular docking and in vitro mutagenesis experiments showed that ceramide binds to the sterol carrier protein 2-like domain in Hsd17b4 adjacent to peroxisome targeting signal 1 (PTS1), the C-terminal signal for interaction with peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (Pex5), a peroxin mediating transport of Hsd17b4 into peroxisomes. Inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis induced translocation of Hsd17b4 from CEMAMs to peroxisomes, interaction of Hsd17b4 with Pex5, and upregulation of DHA. This data indicates a novel role of ceramide as a molecular switch regulating interaction of Hsd17b4 with Pex5 and peroxisomal function.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that the cardiolipin (CL)-deficient yeast mutant, crd1Δ, has decreased levels of acetyl-CoA and decreased activities of the TCA cycle enzymes aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase. These biochemical phenotypes are expected to lead to defective TCA cycle function. In this study, we report that signaling and anaplerotic metabolic pathways that supplement defects in the TCA cycle are essential in crd1Δ mutant cells. The crd1Δ mutant is synthetically lethal with mutants in the TCA cycle, retrograde (RTG) pathway, glyoxylate cycle, and pyruvate carboxylase 1. Glutamate levels were decreased, and the mutant exhibited glutamate auxotrophy. Glyoxylate cycle genes were up-regulated, and the levels of glyoxylate metabolites succinate and citrate were increased in crd1Δ. Import of acetyl-CoA from the cytosol into mitochondria is essential in crd1Δ, as deletion of the carnitine-acetylcarnitine translocase led to lethality in the CL mutant. β-oxidation was functional in the mutant, and oleate supplementation rescued growth defects. These findings suggest that TCA cycle deficiency caused by the absence of CL necessitates activation of anaplerotic pathways to replenish acetyl-CoA and TCA cycle intermediates. Implications for Barth syndrome, a genetic disorder of CL metabolism, are discussed.

Abstract: It is well established that a family of dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) play key roles in the regulated dephosphorylation and inactivation of MAP kinase isoforms in mammalian cells and tissues. MKPs provide a mechanism of spatiotemporal feedback control of these key signalling pathways, but can also mediate crosstalk between distinct MAP kinase cascades and facilitate interactions between MAP kinase pathways and other key signalling modules. As our knowledge of the regulation, substrate specificity and catalytic mechanisms of MKPs has matured, more recent work using genetic models has revealed key physiological functions for MKPs and also uncovered potentially important roles in regulating the pathophysiological outcome of signalling with relevance to human diseases. These include cancer, diabetes, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. It is hoped that this understanding will reveal novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for disease, thus contributing to more effective diagnosis and treatment for these debilitating and often fatal conditions.

Abstract: Family with Sequence Similarity 134, Member B (FAM134B) is a protein that known to be necessary for the long-term survival of nociceptive and autonomic ganglion neurons. Recent work has exhibited that FAM134B plays a pivotal role in autophagy-mediated turnover of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, tumor inhibition and lipid homeostasis. In this study, we provide mechanistic links between FAM134B and adipocyte differentiation. Here, we found that adipocyte-specific FAM134B overexpression mice are obese and have increased white adipose tissue (WAT) mass. Serum tests showed that they developed high glucose level and severe insulin resistance. In addition, they also exhibited enhanced autophagy and reduced mitochondria amount, suggesting the function of FAM134B to promote autophagy in adipocytes. Overexpression of FAM134B in 3 T3-L1 preadipocytes promoted autophagy and differentiation, while the effect could be inhibited after treatment with autophagyinhibitors, 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Overexpressioncells also showed an early reduction of mitochondria number, while its autophagy flux level increased fast from differentiation day 2. These findings indicate that FAM134B improves adipocytes differentiation through enhancing mitophagy.

Abstract: Background
The discovery of N‑acylethanolamines (NAEs) has prompted an increase in research aimed at understanding their biological roles including regulation of appetite and energy metabolism. However, a knowledge gap remains to understand the effect of dietary components on NAE levels, in particular, heterogeneity in dietary fatty acid (DFA) profile, on NAE levels across various organs.
Objective
To identify and elucidate the impact of diet on NAE levels in seven different tissues/organs of male hamsters, with the hypothesis that DFA will act as precursors for NAE synthesis in golden Syrian male hamsters.
Method
A two-month feeding trial was performed, wherein hamsters were fed various dietary oil blends with different composition of 18-C fatty acid (FA).
Results
DFA directly influences tissue FA and NAE levels. After C18:1n9-enriched dietary treatments, marked increases were observed in duodenal C18:1n9 and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) concentrations. Among all tissues; adipose tissue brown, adipose tissue white, brain, heart, intestine-duodenum, intestine-jejunum, and liver, a negative correlation was observed between gut-brain OEA concentrations and body weight.
Conclusion
DFA composition influences FA and NAE levels across all tissues, leading to significant shifts in intestinal-brain OEA concentrations. The endogenously synthesized increased OEA levels in these tissues enable the gut-brain-interrelationship. Henceforth, we summarize that the brain transmits anorexic properties mediated via neuronal signalling, which may contribute to the maintenance of healthy body weight. Thus, the benefits of OEA can be enhanced by the inclusion of C18:1n9-enriched diets, pointing to the possible nutritional use of this naturally occurring bioactive lipid-amide in the management of obesity.

Abstract: Phospholipase D (PLD) is a key enzyme involved in numerous processes in all living organisms. Hydrolysis of phospholipids by PLD allows the release of phosphatidic acid which is a crucial intermediate of multiple pathways and signaling reactions, including tumorigenesis in mammals and defense responses in plants. One common feature found in the plant alpha isoform (PLDα), in some PLD from microbes and in all PLD from eukaryotes, is a duplicated motif named HKD involved in the catalysis. However, other residues are strictly conserved among these organisms and their role remains obscure. To gain further insights into PLD structure and the role of these conserved residues, we first looked for all the plant PLDα sequences available in public databases. With >200 sequences retrieved, a generic sequence was constructed showing that 138 residues are strictly conserved among plant PLDα, with some of them identical to residues found in mammalian PLDs. Using site-directed mutagenesis of the PLDα from Arabidopsis thaliana, we demonstrated that mutation of some of these residues abolished the PLD activity. Moreover, mutation of the residues around both HKD motifs enabled us to re-define the consensus sequence of these motifs. By sequential deletions of the N-terminal extremity, the minimum length of the domain required for catalytic activity was determined. Overall, this work furthers our understanding of the structure of eukaryotic PLDs and it may lead to the discovery of new regions involved in the catalytic reaction that could be targeted by small molecule modulators of PLDs.

Abstract: Terpenoid quinones are liposoluble redox-active compounds that serve as essential electron carriers and antioxidants. One such quinone, rhodoquinone (RQ), couples the respiratory electron transfer chain to the reduction of fumarate to facilitate anaerobic respiration. This mechanism allows RQ-synthesizing organisms to operate their respiratory chain using fumarate as a final electron acceptor. RQ biosynthesis is restricted to a handful of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and details of this biosynthetic pathway remain enigmatic. One gene, rquA, was discovered to be required for RQ biosynthesis in Rhodospirillum rubrum. However, the function of the gene product, RquA, has remained unclear. Here, using reverse genetics approaches, we demonstrate that RquA converts ubiquinone to RQ directly. We also demonstrate the first in vivo synthetic production of RQ in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two organisms that do not natively produce RQ. These findings help clarify the complete RQ biosynthetic pathway in species which contain RquA homologs.

Abstract: Olfactory receptors are primarily expressed in nasal olfactory epithelium, but these receptors are also ectopically expressed in diverse tissues. In this study, we investigated the biological functions of Olfr43, a mouse homolog of human OR1A1, in cultured hepatocytes and mice to assess its functionality in lipid metabolism. Olfr43 was expressed in mouse hepatocytes, and Olfr43 activation by a known ligand, (−)-carvone, stimulated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activity. In ligand-receptor binding studies using site-directed mutagenesis, (−)-carvone binding required two residues, M257 and Y258, in Olfr43. In the mouse study, oral administration of (−)-carvone for 5 weeks in high-fat diet-fed mice improved energy metabolism, including reductions in hepatic steatosis and adiposity, and improved glucose and insulin tolerance. In mouse livers and cultured mouse hepatocytes, Olfr43 activation simulated the CREB-hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ signaling axis, leading to a reduction in hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the mouse liver. Thus, long-term administration of (−)-carvone reduces hepatic steatosis. The knockdown of Olfr43 gene expression in cultured hepatocytes negated these effects of (−)-carvone. In conclusion, an ectopic olfactory receptor, hepatic Olfr43, regulates energy metabolism via the CREB-HES1-PPARγ signaling axis.

Abstract: Jasmonates are fatty acid derivatives that control several plant processes including growth, development and defense. Despite the chemical diversity of jasmonates, only jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) has been clearly characterized as the endogenous ligand of the jasmonate co-receptors (COI1-JAZs) in higher plants. Currently, it is accepted that ω-hydroxylation of JA-Ile leads to inactivation of the molecule. This study shows that ω-hydroxylated JA-Ile (12-OH-JA-Ile) retains bioactivity and signals through the canonical JA-pathway. The results suggest that 12-OH-JA-Ile differentially activates a subset of JA-Ile co-receptors that may control and/or modulate particular jasmonate dependent responses. It is proposed that after a strong immune response mediated by JA-Ile, the ω-hydroxylated form modulates JA-Ile activated processes thereby improving plant resilience.

Abstract: Ex vivo regenerated stratum corneum (SC) after tape-stripping can be used as a model to study the barrier function of compromised skin. Yet, details about how close the regenerated SC model mimics the lipid properties (e.g. lipid composition and lipid ordering) of the in vivo situation are not known. Here, we examined using a comprehensive ceramide analysis whether human ex vivo regenerated SC showed similar lipid properties as human in vivo regenerated SC. Both in vivo and ex vivo regenerated SC had an altered ceramide subclass composition, with increased percentages of sphingosine-based subclass and decreased percentages of phytosphingosine-based subclass ceramides, a reduced mean ceramide chain length, and a higher percentage of unsaturated ceramides. Overall, regenerated SC ex vivo showed more pronounced but similar changes compared to the in vivo response. One of the purposes of these models is to use them to mimic compromised skin of inflammatory skin diseases. The altered lipid properties in regenerated SC were comparable to those observed in several inflammatory skin diseases, which makes them a valuable model for the barrier properties in inflammatory skin diseases.

Abstract: Despite strong evidence that high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) modulate the immune response, the role of HDL in allergies is still poorly understood. Many patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) develop a late-phase response, characterized by infiltration of monocytes and eosinophils into the nasal submucosa. Functional impairment of HDL in AR-patients may insufficiently suppress inflammation and cell infiltration, but the effect of AR on the composition and function of HDL is not understood. We used apolipoprotein (apo) B-depleted serum as well as isolated HDL from AR-patients (n = 43) and non-allergic healthy controls (n = 20) for detailed compositional and functional characterization of HDL. Both AR-HDL and apoB-depleted serum of AR-patients showed decreased anti-oxidative capacity and impaired ability to suppress monocyte nuclear factor-κB expression and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-1 beta. Sera of AR-patients showed decreased paraoxonase and cholesteryl-ester transfer protein activities, increased lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 activity, while lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity and cholesterol efflux capacity were not altered. Surprisingly, apoB-depleted serum and HDL from AR-patients showed an increased ability to suppress eosinophil effector responses upon eotaxin-2/CCL24 stimulation. Mass spectrometry and biochemical analyses showed reduced levels of apoA-I and phosphatidylcholine, but increased levels of apoA-II, triglycerides and lyso-phosphatidylcholine in AR-HDL. The changes in AR-HDL composition were associated with altered functional properties. In conclusion, AR alters HDL composition linked to decreased anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties but improves the ability of HDL to suppress eosinophil effector responses.

Abstract: Organisms of the microalgal genus Nannochloropsis produce high levels of triacylglycerols (TAGs), an efficient raw material for biofuels. A complete understanding of the TAG-breakdown pathway is critical for improving the productivity of TAGs to meet future needs. Among a number of lipases annotated as TAG lipase in the genomes of every organism, Arabidopsis SUGAR-DEPENDENT 1 (AtSDP1) lipases are characterized as a type of crucial TAG lipase in plants, similar to ScTgl3–5 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Homologs of the AtSDP1 TAG lipases are universally found in the genomes of plants, fungi, and algae. Here we identified two homologs of AtSDP1 TAG lipases in the oleaginous microalga species Nannochloropsis oceanica, NoTGL1 and NoTGL2. We generated single- and double-knockout strains for these lipases by homologous recombination. Whereas overall TAG content in the NoTGL2 single-knockout mutant was identical to that of wild type, the NoTGL1 knockout showed a two-fold increase in TAG content per cell in early log phase under nutrient-sufficient conditions without affecting growth. Homologs of AtSDP1 in S. cerevisiae are localized to the surface of lipid droplets, and AtSDP1 is transported from peroxisomes to the surface of lipid droplets. In contrast, NoTGL1 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in both Nannochloropsis and yeast. We suggest that homologs of AtSDP1 lipases in Nannochloropsis modulate de novo TAG biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, unlike the roles of these lipases in other organisms. These results provide important insights into the mechanisms of TAG metabolism catalyzed by homologs of AtSDP1 lipase, which are highly conserved across species.

Abstract: Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are secreted by Gram-negative bacteria and induce a stronger inflammatory response than pure LPS. After endocytosis of OMVs by macrophages, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is released from early endosomes to activate its intracellular receptors followed by non-canonical inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, which are critically involved in sepsis development. Previously, we could show that the synthetic anti-endotoxin peptide Pep19-2.5 neutralizes inflammatory responses induced by intracellular LPS. Here, we aimed to investigate whether Pep19-2.5 is able to suppress cytoplasmic LPS-induced inflammation under more physiological conditions by using OMVs which naturally transfer LPS to the cytosol. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed an exothermic reaction between Pep19-2.5 and Escherichia coli OMVs and the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay indicated a strong endotoxin blocking activity. In THP-1 macrophages and primary human macrophages Pep19-2.5 and polymyxin B reduced interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release as well as pyroptosis induced by OMVs, while the Toll-like receptor 4 signaling inhibitor TAK-242 suppressed OMV-induced TNF and IL-1β secretion, but not pyroptosis. Internalization of Pep19-2.5 was at least partially mediated by the P2X7 receptor in macrophages but not in monocytes. Additionally, a cell-dependent difference in the neutralization efficiency of Pep19-2.5 became evident in macrophages and monocytes, indicating a critical role for peptide-mediated IL-1β secretion via the P2X7 receptor. In conclusion, we provide evidence that LPS-neutralizing peptides inhibit OMV-induced activation of the inflammasome/IL-1 axis and give new insights into the mechanism of peptide-mediated neutralization of cytoplasmic LPS suggesting an essential and cell-type specific role for the P2X7 receptor.

Abstract: Lipids droplets (LD) are dynamics organelles that accumulate neutral lipids during nutrient surplus. LD alternates between periods of growth and consumption through regulated processes including as de novo lipogenesis, lipolysis and lipophagy. The liver is a central tissue in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases (NAFLD) is result of the accumulation of LD in liver. Several works have been demonstrated a positive effect of exercise on reduction of liver fat. However, the study of the exercise on liver LD dynamics is far from being understood. Here we investigated the effect of chronic exercise in the regulation of LD dynamics using a mouse model of high fat diet-induced NAFLD. Mice were fed with a high-fat diet or control diet for 12 weeks; then groups were divided into chronic exercise or sedentary for additional 8 weeks. Our results showed that exercise reduced fasting glycaemia, insulin and triacylglycerides, also liver damage. However, exercise did not affect the intrahepatic triacylglycerides levels and the number of LD but reduced their size. In addition, exercise decreased the SREBP-1c levels, without changes in lipolysis, mitochondrial proteins or autophagy/lipophagy markers. Unexpectedly in the control mice, exercise increased the number of LD, also PLIN2, SREBP-1c, FAS, ATGL, HSL and MTTP levels. Our findings show that exercise rescues the liver damage in a model of NAFLD reducing the size of LD and normalizing protein markers of de novo lipogenesis and lipolysis. Moreover, exercise increases proteins associated to LD dynamics in the control mice.

Abstract: Aims
It has been hypothesized that the activity of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), a key enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, is involved in the NAFLD phenotype. To clarify the role of LAL in NAFLD, we studied 164 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and fat-loaded HepG2 cells.
Methods
LAL activity was measured (i) on dried blood spots (DBS) from NAFLD patients and dyslipidemic subjects without fatty liver and (ii) on liver biopsies from NAFLD patients. LAL activity and expression were evaluated in HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of free fatty acids (FAs), with or without a PPAR-alpha agonist.
Results
LAL activity was significantly reduced in patients with NAFLD compared to dyslipidemic subjects. LAL activity measured in liver biopsies from NAFLD patients was highly correlated to that measured on DBS and was independent of LAL expression in the liver. In a fully adjusted model, LAL activity on DBS was associated only with platelets and, when normalized by platelet count, it did not differ according to fibrosis stage. In vitro, FA loading of HepG2 fully replicated the impairment of LAL activity observed in NALFD patients. In these cells, the activation of PPAR-alpha receptors prevented and corrected FA-induced LAL impairment, by stimulating FA oxidation and LAL expression.
Conclusions
LAL activity is reduced in NAFLD patients, independently from disease progression. In vitro, impaired LAL activity induced by FA loading was rescued by PPAR-alpha activation. These data suggest that the pharmacological modulation of LAL should be explored in the management of NAFLD patients.

Abstract: Lipid droplets (LDs) are important organelles involved in energy storage and expenditure. LD dynamics has been investigated using genome-wide image screening methods in yeast and other model organisms. For most studies, genes were identified using two-dimensional images with LD enlargement as readout. Due to imaging limitation, reduction of LD size is seldom explored. Here, we aim to set up a screen that specifically utilizes reduced LD size as the readout. To achieve this, a novel yeast screen is set up to quantitatively and systematically identify genes that regulate LD size through a three-dimensional imaging-based approach. Cidea which promotes LD fusion and growth in mammalian cells was overexpressed in a yeast knockout library to induce large LD formation. Next, an automated, high-throughput image analysis method that monitors LD size was utilized. With this screen, we identified twelve genes that reduced LD size when deleted. The effects of eight of these genes on LD size were further validated in fld1 null strain background. In addition, six genes were previously identified as LD-regulating genes. To conclude, this methodology represents a promising strategy to screen for players in LD size control in both yeast and mammalian cells to aid in the investigation of LD-associated metabolic diseases.

Abstract: The proteome of lipid droplets, storage compartments of triacylglycerols (TAGs), comprises TAG synthesizing and TAG degrading enzymes. Thus, to prevent a futile cycle the activity of enzymes catalyzing key steps in TAG turnover has to be strictly coordinated. The first and committed reaction of TAG synthesis is catalyzed by a glycerol‑3‑phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT). Here we demonstrate that in the model organism yeast the lipid droplet associated GPAT Gpt2 requires phosphorylation at a conserved motif to prevent a futile TAG cycle. Phosphorylation deficiency at the conserved motif increases the enzyme activity of Gpt2 and consequently enhances TAG synthesis. In proliferating cells the phosphorylation deficient GPAT-form contributes to TAG metabolism similar to control. However, during lipolysis the increased activity of phosphorylation deficient Gpt2 causes a constant TAG level by using TAG-released fatty acids as substrate for TAG synthesis. These data strongly indicate that phosphorylation of Gpt2 at a conserved motif plays a critical role in coordinating the synthesis and degradation of TAGs.

We found that ENST00000608794 is expressed at higher levels in dexamethasone treated HepG2 cell, and ENST00000608794 can bind and be regulated by miR-15b-5p. Ectopic expression of ENST00000608794 enhanced steatosis and the protein expression of PDK4 which is a critical gene in lipid metabolism and also is a target of miR-15b-5p. However, the differentiated PDK4 expression between control and ectopic expression of ENST00000608794 was absence in the presence of miR-15b-5p inhibitor. Moreover, in dexamethasone treated HepG2 cell lines, ENST00000608794 increased whether with miR-15b-5p inhibitor treatment or not, while increase of PDK4 expression by dexamethasone was greatly compromised in the presence of miR-15b-5p mimic. Meanwhile, dexamethasone induced steatosis could be ameliorated by silencing ENST00000608794 or expressing miR-15b-5p. Taken together, the results suggested that ENST00000608794 plays an important role in dexamethasone induced steatosis, which was partly mediated by derepressing of PDK4 through competitively binding to miR-15b-5p.

Abstract: Background
Heart is a high energy demand organ and cardiac fat is the main local energy source for heart. Alteration in cardiac fat may affect cardiac energy and contribute to heart dysfunction. We previously observed a link between alteration in pericardial fat (PAT) and local adverse effects on myocardial fibrosis in obese minipigs. This study investigated the role of PAT on cardiac energy and mitochondrial function, and elucidated a potential mechanism for PAT in cardiac fibrosis.
Materials and methods
Five-month-old Lee-Sung minipigs were made obese by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 months. The conditioned medium from PAT of obese minipigs (PAT-CM) was collected and H9C2 cells were treated with it to study mechanisms.
Results
HFD caused a cardiac energy deficit and fibrosis in the left ventricle. An elevated content of IL6 and malondialdehyde was found in the PAT of obese pigs. Obese pigs exhibited an increased level of oleic acid and a reduced level of saturated fatty acids in PAT compared to control pigs. HFD did not alter the metabolic characteristics of epicardial fat. PAT-CM caused apoptosis of H9C2 cells and inhibited basal mitochondrial respiration and ATP production. Protein expressions for mitochondrial dynamics- (Mfn2, Opa1, Drp1, and Fis1) and a mitophagy-related protein (Parkin) were suppressed by PAT-CM. PAT-CM enhanced the protein expression of LC3II, and the ratio of LC3II/LC3I. To conclude, PAT was involved in cardiac fibrosis of HFD-fed minipigs. The secretomes of PAT impaired mitochondrial functions and caused cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a paracrine manner.

Abstract: Long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetases (ACSLs) are a family of enzymes that convert free long-chain fatty acids into their acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) forms. ACSL4, belonging to the ACSL family, shows a preferential use of arachidonic acid (AA) as its substrate and plays a role in the remodeling of AA-containing phospholipids by incorporating free AA. However, little is known about the roles of ACSL4 in inflammatory responses. Here, we assessed the roles of ACSL4 on the effector functions of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) obtained from mice lacking ACSL4. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that various highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA)-derived fatty acyl-CoA species were markedly decreased in the BMDMs obtained from ACSL4-deficient mice compared with those in the BMDMs obtained from wild-type mice. BMDMs from ACSL4-deficient mice also showed a reduced incorporation of HUFA into phosphatidylcholines. The stimulation of BMDMs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elicited the release of prostaglandins (PGs), such as PGE2, PGD2 and PGF2α, and the production of these mediators was significantly enhanced by ACSL4 deficiency. In contrast, neither the LPS-induced release of cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-10, nor the endocytosis of zymosan or dextran was affected by ACSL4 deficiency. These results suggest that ACSL4 has a crucial role in the maintenance of HUFA composition of certain phospholipid species and in the incorporation of free AA into the phospholipids in LPS-stimulated macrophages. ACSL4 dysfunction may facilitate inflammatory responses by an enhanced eicosanoid storm.

Abstract: As lipid microconstituents mainly of plant origin, carotenoids are essential nutrients for humans and animals, and carotenoid coloration represents an important meat quality parameter for many farmed animals. Currently, the mechanism of carotenoid bioavailability in animals is largely unknown mainly due to the limited approaches applied, the shortage of suitable model systems and the restricted taxonomic focus. The mollusk Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) possessing orange adductor muscle with carotenoid deposition, provides a unique opportunity to research the mechanism underlying carotenoid utilization in animals. Herein, through family construction and analysis, we found that carotenoid coloration in scallop muscle is inherited as a recessive Mendelian trait. Using a combination of genomic approaches, we mapped this trait onto chromosome 8, where PyBCO-like 1 encoding carotenoid oxygenase was the only differentially expressed gene between the white and orange muscles (FDR = 2.75E-21), with 11.28-fold downregulation in the orange muscle. Further functional assays showed that PyBCO-like 1 is capable of degrading β-carotene, and inhibiting PyBCO-like 1 expression in the white muscle resulted in muscle coloration and carotenoid deposition. In the hepatopancreas, which is the organ for digestion and absorption, neither the scallop carotenoid concentration nor PyBCO-like 1 expression were significantly different between the two scallops. These results indicate that carotenoids could be taken up in both white- and orange-muscle scallops and then degraded by PyBCO-like 1 in the white muscle. Our data suggest that PyBCO-like 1 is the essential gene for carotenoid metabolism in scallop muscle, and its downregulation leads to carotenoid deposition and muscle coloration.

Abstract: Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) constitutes a metabolic dysfunction characterized by systemic inflammation and body weight loss. Muscle atrophy and adipose tissue lipolysis might explain weight loss in CAC. Specific functions of numerous hormones and cytokines derived from tumours can provoke cachexia. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can be involved in intercellular communication. However, whether EVs participate in this process has not been investigated thoroughly. Using Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell cultures, we tested whether LLC-derived EVs induced C2C12 myotube atrophy and 3T3-L1 adipocyte lipolysis. EVs derived from LLC cells and serum from patients with lung cancer, non-lung cancer controls, tumour-bearing mice, and non-tumour-bearing control mice were isolated and characterized biochemically and biophysically. LLC cell-derived EVs induced dose-dependent effects of atrophy in C2C12 myotubes and lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Mechanistically, EVs directly fused with target C2C12 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and transferred interleukin-6 (IL-6) activates the STAT3 signalling pathway in C2C12 myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Neutralization of extracellular IL-6 prevented the atrophy and lipolysis effects of EVs. Inhibiting the STAT3 signalling pathway also prevented the atrophy and lipolysis effects of EVs. PKH67-labelled (PKH 67 is a lipid dye that can be used to label extracellular vesicles) LLC-EVs were readily internalized into myotubes and adipocytes. Our data showed that LLC cell-derived EVs induced myotube atrophy and adipocyte lipolysis via the extracellular IL-6-mediated STAT3 pathway in target cells. These findings represent a potentially novel basis for further research in this field towards identifying targets and developing strategies for maintaining weight in CAC.

Group VIA phospholipase A2 deficiency in mice chronically fed with high-fat-diet attenuates hepatic steatosis by correcting a defect of phospholipid remodeling,

Abstract: A defect of hepatic remodeling of phospholipids (PL) is seen in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis (NASH) indicating pivotal role of PL metabolism in this disease. The deletion of group VIA calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPla2β) protects ob/ob mice from hepatic steatosis (BBAlip 1861, 2016, 440–461), however its role in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NASH is still elusive. Here, wild-type and iPla2β-null mice were subjected to chronic feeding with HFD for 6 months. We showed that protection was observed in iPla2β-null mice with an attenuation of diet-induced body and liver-weight gains, liver enzymes, serum free fatty acids as well as hepatic TG and steatosis scores. iPla2β deficiency under HFD attenuated the levels of 1-stearoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) as well as elevation of hepatic arachidonate, arachidonate-containing cholesterol esters and prostaglandin E2. More importantly, this deficiency rescued a defect in PL remodeling and attenuated the ratio of saturated and unsaturated PL. The protection by iPla2β deficiency was not observed during short-term HFD feeding of 3 or 5 weeks which showed no PL remodeling defect. In addition to PC/PE, this deficiency reversed the suppression of PC/PI and PE/PI among monounsaturated PL. However, this deficiency did not modulate hepatic PL contents and PL ratios in ER fractions, ER stress, fibrosis, and inflammation markers. Hence, iPla2β inactivation protected mice against hepatic steatosis and obesity during chronic dietary NASH by correcting PL remodeling defect and PI composition relative to PC and PE.

Abstract: Malonyl-CoA synthetase (ACSF3) catalyzes the first step of the mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis (mtFASII). Mutations in ACSF3 cause CMAMMA a rare inborn error of metabolism. The clinical phenotype is very heterogeneous, with some patients presenting with neurologic manifestations. In some children, presenting symptoms such as coma, ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia are suggestive of an intermediary metabolic disorder. The overall pathophysiological mechanisms are not understood. In order to study the role of mtFASII in the regulation of energy metabolism we performed a comprehensive metabolic phenotyping with Seahorse technology proteomics in fibroblasts from healthy controls and ACSF3 patients. SILAC-based proteomics and lipidomic analysis were performed to investigate the effects of hypofunctional mtFASII on proteome and lipid homeostasis of complex lipids. Our data clearly confirmed an impaired mitochondrial flexibility characterized by reduced mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic flux due to a lower lipoylation degree. These findings were accompanied by the adaptational upregulation of β-oxidation and by the reduction of anaplerotic amino acids as compensatory mechanism to address the required energy need. Finally, lipidomic analysis demonstrated that the content of the bioactive lipids sphingomyelins and cardiolipins was strongly increased. Our data clearly demonstrate the role of mtFASII in metabolic regulation. Moreover, we show that mtFASII acts as mediator in the lipid-mediated signaling processes in the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic flexibility.

Abstract: The interest in understanding the capacity of aquatic invertebrates to biosynthesise omega-3 (ω3) long-chain (≥C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) has increased in recent years. Using the common octopus Octopus vulgaris as a model species, we previously characterised a ∆5 desaturase and two elongases (i.e. Elovl2/5 and Elovl4) involved in the biosynthesis of LC-PUFA in molluscs. The aim of this study was to characterise both molecularly and functionally, two methyl-end (or ωx) desaturases that have been long regarded to be absent in most animals. O. vulgaris possess two ωx desaturase genes encoding enzymes with ∆12 and ω3 regioselectivities enabling the de novo biosynthesis of the C18 PUFA 18:2ω6 (LA, linoleic acid) and 18:3ω3 (ALA, α-linolenic acid), generally regarded as dietary essential for animals. The O. vulgaris ∆12 desaturase (“ωx2”) mediates the conversion of 18:1ω9 (oleic acid) into LA, and subsequently, the ω3 desaturase (“ωx1”) catalyses the ∆15 desaturation from LA to ALA. Additionally, the O. vulgaris ω3 desaturase has ∆17 capacity towards a variety of C20 ω6 PUFA that are converted to their ω3 PUFA products. Particularly relevant was the affinity of the ω3 desaturase towards 20:4ω6 (ARA, arachidonic acid) to produce 20:5ω3 (EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid), as supported by yeast heterologous expression, and enzymatic activity exhibited in vivo when paralarvae were incubated in the presence of [1-14C]20:4ω6. These results confirmed that several routes enabling EPA biosynthesis are operative in O. vulgaris whereas ARA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6ω3) should be considered essential fatty acids since endogenous production appears to be limited.

Abstract: Sphingolipids have important functions as structural components of cells but they also function as signaling molecules regulating different cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell migration, cell division and inflammation. Hence, a tight regulation of the sphingolipid homeostasis is essential to maintain proper cellular functions. Mammalian ORMDL proteins are orthologues of the yeast ORM1/2 proteins, which regulate ceramide synthesis in yeast. ORMDL proteins inhibit serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme regulating a rate-limiting step of the sphingolipid pathway to control the levels of ceramides and other sphingolipids. Sphingomyelinase phosphodiesterase like 3b (SMPDL3b) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein in the plasma membrane (PM) and determines membrane fluidity in macrophages. We previously showed that differential expression of SMPDL3b alters the availability of Ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) in human podocytes, which are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filtration barrier. This observation lead us to investigate if SMPDL3b controls C1P availability in human podocytes by interfering with ceramide kinase (CERK) expression and function. We found that SMPDL3b interacts with CERK and can bind to C1P in vitro. Furthermore, CERK expression is reduced when SMPDL3b expression is silenced. These observations led us to propose that one of the mechanisms by which SMPDL3b influences the amount of C1P available in the podocytes is by interfering with the function of CERK thereby maintaining a balance in the levels of the C1P in podocytes.

Abstract: Planarian flatworms are known as the masters of regeneration, re-growing an entire organism from as little as 1/279th part of their body. While the proteomics of these processes has been studied extensively, the planarian lipodome remains relatively unknown. In this study we investigate the lipid profile of planarian tissue sections with imaging Time-of-Flight – Secondary-Ion-Mass-Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). ToF-SIMS is a label-free technique capable of gathering intact, location specific lipid information on a cellular scale. Lipid identities are confirmed using LC-MS/MS. Our data shows that different organ structures within planarians have unique lipid profiles. The 22-carbon atom poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which occur in unusually high amounts in planarians are found to be mainly located in the testes. Additionally, we observe that planarians contain various odd numbered fatty acid species, that are usually found in bacteria, localized in the reproductive and ectodermal structures of the planarian. An abundance of poorly understood ether fatty acids and ether lipids were found in unique areas in planarians as well as a new, yet unidentified class of potential lipids in planarian intestines. Identifying the location of these lipids in the planarian body provides insights into their bodily functions and, in combination with knowledge about their diet and their genome, enables drawing conclusions about planarian fatty acid processing.

Abstract: Hydrophilic bile salts, ursodeoxycholate and hyodeoxycholate, have choleretic effects. ABCB4, a member of the ABC transporter family, is essential for the secretion of phospholipids from hepatocytes into bile. In this study, we assessed the effects of taurine- or glycine-conjugated cholate, ursodeoxycholate and hyodeoxycholate on the ABCB4-mediated phosphatidylcholine (PC) efflux using Abcb4 knockout mice and HEK293 cells stably expressing ABCB4. To evaluate the effects of bile salts on bile formation in Abcb4+/+ or Abcb4−/− mice, the bile was collected during intravenous infusion of saline or bile salts. The biliary PC secretion in Abcb4+/+ mice was significantly increased by the infusions of all tested bile salts, especially taurohyodeoxycholate. On the other hand, Abcb4−/− mice exhibited extremely low secretion of PC into bile, which was not altered by bile salt infusions. We also showed that the PC efflux from ABCB4-expressing HEK293 cells was stimulated by taurohyodeoxycholate much more strongly than the other tested bile salts. However, taurohyodeoxycholate did not restore the activities of ABCB4 mutants. Furthermore, light scattering measurements demonstrated a remarkable ability of taurohyodeoxycholate to form mixed micelles with PC. Therefore, the enhancing effect of taurohyodeoxycholate on the ABCB4-mediated PC efflux may be due to the strong mixed micelle formation ability.

Abstract: Ras-GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain)-binding proteins (G3BPs, also known as Rasputin) are a family of RNA binding proteins that regulate gene expression in response to environmental stresses by controlling mRNA stability and translation. G3BPs appear to facilitate this activity through their role in stress granules for which they are considered a core component, however, it should be noted that not all stress granules contain G3BPs and this appears to be contextual depending on the environmental stress and the cell type. Although the role of G3BPs in stress granules appears to be one of its major roles, data also strongly suggests that they interact with mRNAs outside of stress granules to regulate gene expression. G3BPs have been implicated in several diseases including cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis as well as virus survival. There is now a body of evidence that suggests targeting of G3BPs could be explored as a form of cancer therapeutic. This review discusses the important discoveries and advancements made in the field of G3BPs biology over the last two decades including their roles in RNA stability, translational control of cellular transcripts, stress granule formation, cancer progression and its interactions with viruses during infection. An emerging theme for G3BPs is their ability to regulate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli, disease progression and virus infection making it an intriguing target for disease therapies.

Abstract: In each menstrual cycle endometrial stromal cells (hESC) proliferate and differentiate into specialized decidual cells, a process termed decidualization, which regulates endometrial receptivity. Decidualization is mainly controlled by sex ovarian hormones, estradiol (E2) and progesterone. E2 plays an important role in the expression of the progesterone receptor and promotes the endometrial stromal cells differentiation. Our group previously reported that anandamide (AEA) impairs decidualization through cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). In this study, we hypothesized whether AEA inhibitory effect on cell decidualization could be mediated through interaction with aromatase and consequent interference in estradiol production/signaling. We used an immortalized human endometrial stromal cell line (St-T1b) and human decidual fibroblasts (HdF) derived from human term placenta. In cells exposed to a differentiation stimulus, AEA-treatment prevents the increase of the expression of CYP19A1 gene encoding aromatase, E2 levels and of estradiol receptor expression, that are observed in differentiating cells. Regarding CYP19A1 mRNA levels, the effect was partially reverted by a CB1 receptor antagonist and by a COX2 inhibitor. In addition, we report that AEA presents anti-aromatase activity in placental microsomes, the nature of the inhibition being the uncommon mixed type as revealed by the kinetic studies. Structural analysis of the AEA-Aromatase complexes determined that AEA may bind to the active site pocket of the enzyme. In overall we report that AEA inhibits aromatase activity and may affect E2 signaling crucial for the decidualization process, indicating that a deregulation of the endocannabinoid system may be implicated in endometrial dysfunction and in fertility/infertility disorders.

Abstract: Due to the insufficient fetal cholesterol synthesis, maternal cholesterol transport through the placenta becomes an important source of fetal cholesterol pool, which is essential for fetal growth and development. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dexamethasone on fetal cholesterol levels, and explore its placental mechanism. Pregnant Wistar rats were injected subcutaneously with dexamethasone (0.8 mg/kg·d) from gestational day 9 to 20. Results showed that dexamethasone increased maternal serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, as well as placental cholesterol synthesis and TC concentration, while reduced fetal birth weight, and serum TC, HDL-C and LDL-C levels. Meanwhile, the expression of placental cholesterol transporters, including low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-B1) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 and G1 (ABCA1 and ABCG1) were decreased by dexamethasone. Furthermore, the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) were increased, while the H3K9ac and expression levels of liver X receptor α (LXRα) promoter were reduced. In human trophoblast cell line (BeWo), dexamethasone concentration-dependently decreased the expression levels of LDLR, SR-B1, ABCA1, ABCG1 as well as LXRα. Dexamethasone (2500 nM) induced GR translocation into nucleus and recruited HDAC3. Furthermore, LXRα agonist and GR inhibitor reversed respectively dexamethasone-induced the expression inhibitions of cholesterol transporter and LXRα, and HDAC3 siRNA reversed the H3K9ac level of LXRα promoter and its expression. Together, dexamethasone impaired placental cholesterol transport and eventually decreased fetal cholesterol levels, which is related to the down-regulation of LXRα mediated by GR/HDAC3/H3K9ac signaling.

Abstract: Cholesterol accumulation is a hallmark of prostate cancer (PCa) enabled by the upregulation of its synthesis, which presents a potential therapeutic target. This pathway is suppressed by the E3 ubiquitin ligase membrane-associated RING-CH-type finger 6 (MARCH6); however, little is known of MARCH6 regulation, particularly at the transcriptional level. Here, we consulted large transcriptomic PCa datasets to investigate transcription factors and DNA sequence elements that regulate the MARCH6 gene. Amongst 498 primary PCa tissues of The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified a striking positive correlation between MARCH6 and androgen receptor (AR) gene expression (r = 0.81, p < 1 × 10−117) that held in other primary tumour datasets. Two putative androgen response elements were identified in the MARCH6 gene using motif prediction and mining of publicly accessible chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data. However, MARCH6 expression was not androgen-responsive in luciferase reporter and qRT-PCR assays. Instead, we established that the MARCH6–AR correlation in primary PCa is due to common regulation by the transcription factor Sp1. We located a region 100 bp downstream of the MARCH6 transcriptional start site that contains three Sp1 binding sites and strongly upregulates promoter activity. The functionality of this region, and Sp1-mediated upregulation of MARCH6, was confirmed using pharmacological and genetic inhibition of Sp1. Moreover, modulation of Sp1 activity affected the stability of squalene monooxygenase, a cholesterol biosynthesis enzyme and MARCH6 substrate. We thus establish Sp1 as the first known regulator of the MARCH6 gene and demonstrate that interrogation of transcriptomic datasets can assist in the de novo inference of transcriptional regulation.

Abstract: Enzymes of CYP74 family widespread in higher plants control the metabolism of fatty acid hydroperoxides to numerous bioactive oxylipins. Hydroperoxide lyases (HPLs, synonym: hemiacetal synthases) of CYP74B subfamily belong to the most common CYP74 enzymes. HPLs isomerize the hydroperoxides to the short-lived hemiacetals, which are spontaneously decomposed to aldehydes and aldoacids. All CYP74Bs studied yet except the CYP74B16 (flax divinyl ether synthase, LuDES) possessed the 13-HPL activity. Present work reports the cloning of the expressed CYP74B33 gene of carrot (Daucus carota L.) and studies of catalytic properties of the recombinant CYP74B33 protein. In contrast to all CYP74B proteins studied yet, CYP74B33 behaved differently in few respects. Firstly, the preferred substrates of CYP74B33 are 9-hydroperoxides. Secondly and most importantly, CYP74B33 exhibits the 9-allene oxide synthase (AOS) activity. For example, the 9(S)-hydroperoxide of linoleic acid (9-HPOD) underwent the conversion to α-ketol via the short-lived allene oxide. Uncommonly, the 9-HPOD conversion affords a minority of cis-10-oxo-11-phytoenoic acid, which is also produced by CYP74C but not the CYP74A AOSs. The similar product patterns were observed upon the incubations of CYP74B33 with 9(S)-hydroperoxide of α-linolenic acid. The enzyme possessed a mixed HPL, AOS, and the epoxyalcohol synthase activity toward the 13-hydroperoxides, but the total activity was much lower than toward 9-hydroperoxides. Thus, the obtained results show that CYP74B33 is an unprecedented 9-AOS within the CYP74B subfamily.

Abstract: The mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) has been implicated with mitochondrial morphology, function and, more recently, with cellular proliferation. Tafazzin, an acyltransferase with key functions in CL remodeling determining actual CL composition, affects mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we show that the CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knock-out of tafazzin (Taz) is associated with substantial alterations of various mitochondrial and cellular characteristics in C6 glioma cells. The knock-out of tafazzin substantially changed the profile of fatty acids incorporated in CL and the distribution of molecular CL species. Taz knock-out was further associated with decreased capacity of oxidative phosphorylation that mainly originates from impaired complex I associated energy metabolism in C6 glioma cells. The lack of tafazzin switched energy metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis indicated by lower respiration rates, membrane potential and higher levels of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species but keeping the cellular ATP content unchanged. The impact of tafazzin on mitochondria was also indicated by altered morphology and arrangement in tafazzin deficient C6 glioma cells. In the cells we observed tafazzin-dependent changes in the distribution of cellular fatty acids as an indication of altered lipid metabolism as well as in stability/morphology. Most impressive is the dramatic reduction in cell proliferation in tafazzin deficient C6 glioma cells that is not mediated by reactive oxygen species. Our data clearly indicate that defects in CL phospholipid remodeling trigger a cascade of events including modifications in CL linked to subsequent alterations in mitochondrial and cellular functions.

Abstract: Accumulation of cholesterol is a well-known feature in cancer. Preclinical studies suggest the contribution of various cholesterol regulators in CRC. However, their clinical relevance remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the expression of these modulators in CRC and elucidate their diagnostic and prognostic value. mRNA levels of HMGCR, SREBF2, NR1H3 and NR1H2 were downregulated in tumors in local and TCGA cohort. The expression of LDLR, ABCA1 and SCARB1 was not consistent in the two cohorts. Western Blot analysis showed the increased levels of LDLR and reduced levels of LXR in early stage patients. Tumoral SREBP2 levels were enhanced in early stage whereas decreased in late stage. The individual expression of HMGCR, SREBF2, NR1H3 and NR1H2 did not have the potential to be used as independent prognostic marker, however, the combined expression of these genes associated with poor clinical outcome independent of lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and advanced stage. This work sheds light on deregulation of cholesterol uptake and efflux pathways and provides novel leads in the development of biomarkers and therapeutic regimens that can detect and target CRC at initial stages.

Abstract: Aims
The aim of this study is to determine the physical and functional interplay between fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) and its membrane receptor-like candidate protein, cytokeratin 1 (CK1), and to determine the effect of hindering CK1-mediated FABP4 cellular uptake on non-disturbed or metabolically stressed endothelial cells.
Methods
We monitored the direct interaction between FABP4 and CK1 using surface plasmon resonance, and the effects of blocking exogenous FABP4 (eFABP4) cellular uptake were determined by using specific siRNA to knock down the expression of CK1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The expression and nuclear translocation of transcription factors involved in oxidative stress (NRF2) and inflammation (p65 subunit of NF-ĸB transcription factor) were determined by Western blotting analysis.
Results
Our data showed that FABP4 and CK1 bind to each other and that the putative FABP4 binding domain would be within the 151GIQEVTINQSLLQPLNVEID170 CK1 sequence. We determined that in non-disturbed or metabolically stressed endothelial cells, eFABP4 regulates the cellular response to oxidative stress. In addition, we also found that in the presence of palmitate, eFABP4 increases the pro-inflammatory effects induced by palmitate per se, probably due to an increase in the transport of palmitate inside cells, suggesting that these FABP4-mediated pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects are dependent on CK1 expression.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that CK1 facilitates eFABP4 cellular uptake in endothelial cells. Therefore, the CK1-targeted inhibition of exogenous FABP4 cellular uptake might be a potential therapeutic strategy to protect endothelial cells against FABP4-induced activation of inflammation and oxidative stress.

Sustained phospholipase C stimulation of H9c2 cardiomyoblasts by vasopressin induces an increase in CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 1 (CDS1) through protein kinase C and cFos,

Abstract: Chronic stimulation (24 h) with vasopressin leads to hypertrophy in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and this is accompanied by continuous activation of phospholipase C. Consequently, vasopressin stimulation leads to a depletion of phosphatidylinositol levels. The substrate for phospholipase C is phosphatidylinositol (4, 5) bisphosphate (PIP2) and resynthesis of phosphatidylinositol and its subsequent phosphorylation maintains the supply of PIP2. The resynthesis of PI requires the conversion of phosphatidic acid to CDP-diacylglycerol catalysed by CDP-diacylglycerol synthase (CDS) enzymes. To examine whether the resynthesis of PI is regulated by vasopressin stimulation, we focussed on the CDS enzymes. Three CDS enzymes are present in mammalian cells: CDS1 and CDS2 are integral membrane proteins localised at the endoplasmic reticulum and TAMM41 is a peripheral protein localised in the mitochondria. Vasopressin selectively stimulates an increase CDS1 mRNA that is dependent on protein kinase C, and can be inhibited by the AP-1 inhibitor, T-5224. Vasopressin also stimulates an increase in cFos protein which is inhibited by a protein kinase C inhibitor. We conclude that vasopressin stimulates CDS1 mRNA through phospholipase C, protein kinase C and cFos and provides a potential mechanism for maintenance of phosphatidylinositol levels during long-term phospholipase C signalling.

Abstract: Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 (ACSL1) plays a pivotal role in fatty acid β‑oxidation in heart, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. However, key functions of ACSL1 in the liver remain largely unknown. We investigated acute effects of hepatic ACSL1 deficiency on lipid metabolism in adult mice under hyperlipidemic and normolipidemic conditions. We knocked down hepatic ACSL1 expression using adenovirus expressing a ACSL1 shRNA (Ad-shAcsl1) in mice fed a high-fat diet or a normal chow diet. Hepatic ACSL1 depletion generated a hypercholesterolemic phenotype in mice fed both diets with marked elevations of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and free cholesterol in circulation and accumulations of cholesterol in the liver. Furthermore, SREBP2 pathway in ACSL1 depleted livers was severely repressed with a 50% reduction of LDL receptor protein levels. In contrast to the dysregulated cholesterol metabolism, serum triglycerides, free fatty acid and phospholipid levels were unaffected. Mechanistic investigations of genome-wide gene expression profiling and pathway analysis revealed that ACSL1 depletion repressed expressions of several key enzymes for bile acid biosynthesis, consequently leading to reduced liver bile acid levels and altered bile acid compositions. These results are the first demonstration of a requisite role of ACSL1 in bile acid biosynthetic pathway in liver tissue. Furthermore, we discovered that Acsl1 is a novel molecular target of the bile acid-activated farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Activation of FXR by agonist obeticholic acid repressed the expression of ACSL1 protein and mRNA in the liver of FXR wild-type mice but not in FXR knockout mice.

Abstract: Inflammatory lipid mediators play various roles in colorectal cancer progression through complex pathways. However, the mechanism by which lipoxygenase-derived inflammatory lipid mediators contribute to colorectal cancer progression remains elusive. In this study, we found that BLT2, a cell surface GPCR for leukotriene B4 and 12‑hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, is highly upregulated in KRAS mutant LOVO and SW480 colorectal cancer cells and plays critical roles in mediating proliferation through activation of phosphatidylinositol 3‑kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and subsequent upregulation of cyclin D1. Exposure to BLT2 siRNA or LY255283, a specific BLT2 inhibitor, clearly suppressed the proliferation of KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cells and markedly increased cell cycle arrest by downregulating the PI3K/Akt-cyclin D1 cascade. Xenograft tumor formation by LOVO and SW480 cells in athymic mice was also substantially reduced by treatment with the BLT2 inhibitor in vivo. Together, our study demonstrates that BLT2 is necessary for the proliferation of LOVO and SW480 cells and thus may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of KRAS mutant colorectal cancer.

Abstract: For vertebrates, the adequate supply of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) by the diet, in particular ω3 long-chain PUFA, is considered essential for neural development, growth and reproduction. In contrast to aquatic ecosystems, ω3 long-chain PUFA apparently are not widely available in the terrestrial food chain. Their de novo synthesis requires the presence of Δ12 and ω3 fatty acid desaturase enzymes, which are absent in vertebrates but present, for example, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (FAT-2 and FAT-1). This raises the question if soil-dwelling nematodes offer substantial supply of these valuable nutritional compounds in terrestrial food webs. BLAST searches in available nematode genomes revealed the existence of fat-2 like genes in almost all clade III–V species, but failed to identify orthologs in clade I–II nematodes. An additional RT-PCR screen across soil-dwelling nematode species identified six novel fat-2 like genes. Hints for the genetic basis of a ω3 (fat-1) desaturase activity was found only in selected clade IV–V species, but not in clades I to III nematodes. Fatty acid pattern analyses following a PUFA-free cultivation and enzymatic characterization of six selected fat-2 or fat-1 like desaturases in yeast confirmed the findings from the genetic approaches. Thus, in similar soil habitats, taxa exist that can synthesize ω3 long-chain PUFA (as Panagrolaimus, Mesorhabditis and Caenorhabditis) whereas others are unable to do so (Acrobeloides, Cephalobus and Oscheius). While these nematodes do not differ in trophic position or major diet, distinction in reproduction mode may have led to the observed variations in desaturase genes.

Abstract: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a potential target to treat cardiometabolic disorders because of its capacity to combust glucose and fatty acids for thermoregulation. Its cellular and molecular investigation in humans is hampered by the limited availability of cell material and the heterogeneity of BAT between and within individuals. In this study, monoclonal lines of conditionally immortalized brown preadipocytes (iBPAs) of mouse and human origin were generated. Conditional immortalization was achieved by doxycycline-controlled expression of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (LT) with a repressor-based Tet-On system. In the presence of doxycycline, both the murine and human cell lines showed long-term proliferation capacity with a population doubling time of ~28 h. After switching off LT expression by doxycycline removal and exposure to adipogenic differentiation medium, cells from both species acquired brown adipocyte properties. This was evidenced by the accumulation of multilocular lipid droplets, the upregulation of brown adipocyte markers including uncoupling protein 1 and an increase in lipolysis and oxygen consumption following adrenergic stimulation. Switching off LT expression before the onset of adipogenic differentiation was only critical for inducing adipogenesis in the human iBPAs, while their murine counterparts showed adipogenesis upon exposure to the adipogenic differentiation cocktail regardless of LT expression. When switched to proliferation medium, cultures of adipogenically differentiated human iBPAs de-differentiated and resumed cell division without losing their adipogenic capacity. We suggest that iBPAs represent an easy-to-use model for fundamental and applied research into BAT offering unique experimental opportunities due to their capacity to switch between proliferative and differentiated states.

Abstract: Two-pore channels (TPCs) are Ca2+-permeable ion channels localised to the endo-lysosomal system where they regulate trafficking of various cargoes including viruses. As a result, TPCs are emerging as important drug targets. However, their pharmacology is ill-defined. There are no approved drugs to target them. And their mechanism of ligand activation is largely unknown. Here, we identify a number of FDA-approved drugs as TPC pore blockers. Using a model of the pore of human TPC2 based on recent structures of mammalian TPCs, we virtually screened a database of ~1500 approved drugs. Because TPCs have recently emerged as novel host factors for Ebola virus entry, we reasoned that Ebola virus entry inhibitors may exert their effects through inhibition of TPCs. Cross-referencing hits from the TPC virtual screen with two recent high throughput anti-Ebola screens yielded approved drugs targeting dopamine and estrogen receptors as common hits. These compounds inhibited endogenous NAADP-evoked Ca2+ release from sea urchin egg homogenates, NAADP-mediated channel activity of TPC2 re-routed to the plasma membrane, and PI(3,5)P2-mediated channel activity of TPC2 expressed in enlarged lysosomes. Mechanistically, single channel analyses showed that the drugs reduced mean open time consistent with a direct action on the pore. Functionally, drug potency in blocking TPC2 activity correlated with inhibition of Ebola virus-like particle entry. Our results expand TPC pharmacology through the identification of approved drugs as novel blockers, support a role for TPCs in Ebola virus entry, and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying channel regulation.

Abstract: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which accounts for the majority of kidney cancer, is known to accumulate excess cholesterol. However, the mechanism and functional significance of the lipid accumulation for development of the cancer remains obscure. In this study, we analyzed 42 primary ccRCC samples, and determined that cholesterol levels of ~ 70% of the tumors were at least two-fold higher than that of benign kidney tissues. Compared to tumors without cholesterol accumulation, those containing excess cholesterol expressed higher levels of scavenger receptor BI (SR-B1), a receptor for uptake of HDL-associated cholesterol, but not genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake of LDL-associated cholesterol. To further determine the roles of sterol accumulation for cancer development, we implanted ccRCC from patients into mouse kidneys using a mouse ccRCC xenograft model. Feeding mice with probucol, a compound lowing HDL-cholesterol, markedly reduced levels of cholesterol in tumors containing excess cholesterol. This treatment, however, did not affect growth of these tumors. Our study suggests that cholesterol overaccumulation in ccRCC is the consequence of increased uptake of HDL-cholesterol as a result of SR-B1 overexpression, but the lipid accumulation by itself may not play a significant role in progression of the cancer.

Abstract: Yeast phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) Pdr17 is an essential component of the complex required for decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PS) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at a non-mitochondrial location. According to current understanding, this process involves the transfer of PS from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi/endosomes. We generated a Pdr17E237A, K269A mutant protein to better understand the mechanism by which Pdr17p participates in the processes connected to the decarboxylation of PS to PE. We show that the Pdr17E237A, K269A mutant protein is not capable of binding phosphatidylinositol (PI) using permeabilized human cells, but still retains the ability to transfer PI between two membrane compartments in vitro. We provide data together with molecular models showing that the mutations E237A and K269A changed only the lipid binding cavity of Pdr17p and not its surface properties. In contrast to Pdr16p, a close homologue, the ability of Pdr17p to bind PI is not required for its major cellular function in the inter-membrane transfer of PS. We hypothesize that these two closely related yeast PITPs, Pdr16p and Pdr17p, have evolved from a common ancestor. Pdr16p fulfills those role(s) in which the ability to bind and transfer PI is required, while Pdr17p appears to have adapted to a different role which does not require the high affinity binding of PI, although the protein retains the capacity to transfer PI. Our results indicate that PITPs function in complex ways in vivo and underscore the need to consider multiple PITP parameters when studying these proteins in vitro.

Abstract: Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) hydrolyzes cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglycerides (TG) to generate fatty acids (FA) and cholesterol. LAL deficiency (LAL-D) in both humans and mice leads to hepatomegaly, hypercholesterolemia, and shortened life span. Despite its essential role in lysosomal neutral lipid catabolism, the cell type-specific contribution of LAL to disease progression is still elusive. To investigate the role of LAL in the liver in more detail and to exclude the contribution of LAL in macrophages, we generated hepatocyte-specific LAL-deficient mice (Liv-Lipa−/−) and fed them either chow or high fat/high cholesterol diets (HF/HCD). Comparable to systemic LAL-D, Liv-Lipa−/− mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity independent of food intake, movement, and energy expenditure. Reduced body weight gain was mainly due to reduced white adipose tissue depots. Furthermore, Liv-Lipa−/− mice exhibited improved glucose clearance during glucose and insulin tolerance tests compared to control mice. Analysis of hepatic lipid content revealed a massive reduction of TG, whereas CE concentrations were markedly increased, leading to CE crystal formation in the livers of Liv-Lipa−/− mice. Elevated plasma transaminase activities, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as hepatic macrophage infiltration indicated liver inflammation. Our data provide evidence that hepatocyte-specific LAL deficiency is sufficient to alter whole-body lipid and energy homeostasis in mice. We conclude that hepatic LAL plays a pivotal role by preventing liver damage and maintaining lipid and energy homeostasis, especially during high lipid availability.

Abstract: Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is the main plasma carrier of triacylglycerol that is elevated in pathological conditions such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity and dyslipidemia. How variations in triacylglycerol levels influence structural stability and remodeling of VLDL and its metabolic product, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), is unknown. We applied a biochemical and biophysical approach using lipoprotein remodeling by lipoprotein lipase and cholesterol ester transfer protein, along with thermal denaturation that mimics key aspects of lipoprotein remodeling in vivo. The results revealed that increasing the triacylglycerol content in VLDL promotes changes in the lipoprotein size and release of the exchangeable apolipoproteins. Similarly, increased triacylglycerol content in LDL promotes lipoprotein remodeling and fusion. These effects were observed in single-donor lipoproteins from healthy subjects enriched in exogenous triolein, in single-donor lipoproteins from healthy subjects with naturally occurring differences in endogenous triacylglycerol, and in LDL and VLDL from pooled plasma of diabetic and normolipidemic patients. Consequently, triacylglycerol-induced destabilization is a general property of plasma lipoproteins. This destabilization reflects a direct effect of triacylglycerol on lipoproteins. Moreover, we show that TG can act indirectly by increasing lipoprotein susceptibility to oxidation and lipolysis and thereby promoting the generation of free fatty acids that augment fusion. These in vitro findings are relevant to lipoprotein remodeling and fusion in vivo. In fact, fusion of LDL and VLDL enhances their retention in the arterial wall and, according to the response-to-retention hypothesis, triggers atherosclerosis. Therefore, enhanced fusion of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins suggests a new causative link between elevated plasma triacylglycerol and atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (hMSCs) are used in experimental cell therapy to treat various immunological disorders, and the extracellular vesicles (hMSC-EVs) they produce have emerged as an option for cell-free therapeutics. The immunomodulatory function of hMSCs resembles the resolution of inflammation, in which proresolving lipid mediators (LMs) play key roles. Multiple mechanisms underlying the hMSC immunosuppressive effect has been elucidated; however, the impact of LMs and EVs in the resolution is poorly understood. In this study, we supplemented hMSCs with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs); arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, which serve as precursors for multiple LMs. We then determined the consequent compositional modifications in the fatty acid, phospholipid, and LM profiles. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed that the supplemented PUFAs were incorporated into the main membrane phospholipid classes with different dynamics, with phosphatidylcholine serving as the first acceptor. Most importantly, the PUFA modifications were transferred into hMSC-EVs, which are known to mediate hMSC immunomodulation. Furthermore, the membrane-incorporated PUFAs influenced the LM profile by increasing the production of downstream prostaglandin E2 and proresolving LMs, including Resolvin E2 and Resolvin D6. The production of LMs was further enhanced by a highly proinflammatory stimulus, which resulted in an increase in a number of mediators, most notably prostaglandins, while other stimulatory conditions had less a pronounced impact after a 48-h incubation. The current findings suggest that PUFA manipulations of hMSCs exert significant immunomodulatory effects via EVs and proresolving LMs, the composition of which can be modified to potentiate the therapeutic impact of hMSCs.

iPla2β deficiency in mice fed with MCD diet does not correct the defect of phospholipid remodeling but attenuates hepatocellular injury via an inhibition of lipid uptake genes,

Abstract: Group VIA calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPla2β) is among modifier genes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which leads to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Consistently, iPla2β deletion protects hepatic steatosis and obesity in genetic ob/ob and obese mice chronically fed with high-fat diet by replenishing the loss of hepatic phospholipids (PL). As mouse feeding with methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet is a model of lean NASH, we tested whether iPla2β-null mice could still be protected since PL syntheses are disturbed. MCD-diet feeding of female wild-type for 5 weeks induced hepatic steatosis with a severe reduction of body and visceral fat weights concomitant with a decrease of hepatic phosphatidylcholine. These parameters were not altered in MCD-fed iPla2β-null mice. However, iPla2β deficiency attenuated MCD-induced elevation of serum transaminase activities and hepatic expression of fatty-acid translocase Cd36, fatty-acid binding protein-4, peroxisome-proliferator activated receptorγ, and HDL-uptake scavenger receptor B type 1. The reduction of lipid uptake genes was consistent with a decrease of hepatic esterified and unesterified fatty acids and cholesterol esters. On the contrary, iPla2β deficiency under MCD did not have any effects on inflammasomes and pro-inflammatory markers but exacerbated hepatic expression of myofibroblast α-smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Thus, without any rescue of PL loss, iPla2β inactivation attenuated hepatocellular injury in MCD-induced NASH with a novel mechanism of lipid uptake inhibition. Taken together, we have shown that iPla2β mediates hepatic steatosis and lipotoxicity in hepatocytes in both obese and lean NASH, but elicits exacerbated liver fibrosis in lean NASH likely by affecting other cell types.

Abstract: Cells maintain physicochemical characteristics of membranes in order to allow for proper function of membrane-associated cellular processes, such as endocytosis and exocytosis. To investigate the interplay between membrane properties and biological processes, we applied lipid engineering approaches that allowed for systematic manipulation of fatty acid unsaturation and sterol biosynthesis, the main regulators of membrane fluidity. In combination with electrophysiological membrane capacitance measurements, we were able to study the dependence of the endo- and exocytic activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on membrane lipid composition in vivo. We found that a strong decrease in the cell's total ergosterol content leads to a severely reduced frequency of vesicle fission (endocytosis), whereas the exocytic activity remained largely unaffected. In contrast, increased lipid saturation lowered both endocytic and the exocytic activity, with the former being more severely affected. We were able to correlate the decreased ratio of endocytic/exocytic frequencies (fendo/fexo) upon lipid perturbation with the growth of yeast protoplasts, which is based on a surface enlargement resulting from a net excess of exocytic over endocytic flux. Experiments using clathrin-deficient mutants confirm a correlation between reduced endocytic activity and increased size of intact walled cells, as well as accelerated protoplast growth. These data show that lipid composition is intimately tied to membrane trafficking in yeast cells and suggest that endocytosis is particularly dependent on the lipid-defined properties of cell membrane.

A novel mutation in the promoter region of RPL8 regulates milk fat traits in dairy cattle by binding transcription factor Pax6,

Abstract: Ribosomal protein L8 (RPL8) was considered as a promising candidate gene for the milk fat percentage trait in dairy cattle in our previous genome-wide association studies, but the mechanism remains to be determined. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of bovine RPL8 on milk fat percentage. We demonstrated that RPL8 silencing in bovine mammary epithelial cells affected the expression of genes encoding fat-related enzymes (ACACA, FASN, ACSS1, FABP3, SREBP-1, DGAT1, GPAM, PLIN2, PLIN5 and CIDEA). Furthermore, we showed here that a single nucleotide polymorphism, g.-931G > T (chr14:1508300, UMD3.1) in the putative RPL8 promoter region significantly reduced its promoter activity. Interestingly, this decrease in activity was paralleled by lower RPL8 expression in mammary gland tissues of dairy cattle with the homozygous TT genotype compared to that of cattle with the wild-type homozygous GG genotype. Importantly, we found g.-931G > T added a paired box 6 (Pax6)-binding site and this mutation located in the presumed Pax6-binding site. EMSA and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays confirmed the interaction between RPL8 and Pax6 and the T allele exhibited a higher affinity of DNA/protein interactions than G allele, suggesting that Pax6 is an important transcription factor for RPL8 expression. In addition, lactating cows with the GG and GT genotypes presented a significant decrease in milk fat percentage compared to cows with TT genotypes. Altogether, our study indicated that g.-931G > T at RPL8 promoter altered its expression by affecting the interplay between Pax6 and RPL8, which may account for the association with milk fat traits. Findings herein first elucidated the biological function of RPL8 gene in milk fat and the identified SNP g.-931G > T may be considered as genetic makers for breeding in dairy cattle.

ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 deficiency is associated with mild glucocorticoid insufficiency in mice,

Abstract: Objective
Since cholesterol is the sole precursor for glucocorticoid synthesis, it is hypothesized that genetic defects in proteins that impact the cellular cholesterol pool may underlie glucocorticoid insufficiency in humans. In the current study, we specifically focused on the cholesterol efflux mediator ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1) as gene candidate.
Methods
The adrenal transcriptional response to fasting stress was measured in wild-type mice to identify putative novel gene candidates. Subsequently, the adrenal glucocorticoid function was compared between ABCG1 knockout mice and wild-type controls.
Results
Overnight food deprivation induced a change in relative mRNA expression levels of cholesterol metabolism-related proteins previously linked to steroidogenesis, i.e. scavenger receptor class B type I (+149%; P < 0.001), LDL receptor (−70%; P < 0.001) and apolipoprotein E (−41%; P < 0.01). Strikingly, ABCG1 transcript levels were also markedly decreased (−61%; P < 0.05). In contrast to our hypothesis that decreasing cholesterol efflux would increase the adrenal cholesterol pool and enhance glucocorticoid output, ABCG1 knockout mice as compared to wild-type mice exhibited a reduced ability to secrete corticosterone in response to an ACTH challenge (two-way ANOVA: P < 0.001 for genotype) or fasting stress. As a result, glucocorticoid target gene expression levels in liver and hypothalamus were reduced and blood lymphocyte concentrations and spleen weights increased in ABCG1 knockout mice under fasting stress conditions. This was paralleled by a 48% reduction in adrenal cholesteryl ester stores and stimulation of adrenal NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 2 (+37%; P < 0.05) and apolipoprotein E (+59%; P < 0.01) mRNA expression.
Conclusion
ABCG1 deficiency is associated with mild glucocorticoid insufficiency in mice.

Abstract: Adipogenesis has an important role in regulating energy balance, tissue homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes have been widely used as an in vitro model for studying adipocyte differentiation. We here show that KCTD1, a member of the potassium channel containing tetramerization domain proteins, plays an active role in adipogenesis. In particular, we show KCTD1 expression 3T3-L1 cells increases upon adipogenesis induction. Treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with Kctd1-specific siRNA inhibited the differentiation, as indicated by reduction of expression of the specific adipogenic markers C/ebpα, Pparγ2, Glut4, and Adiponectin. Moreover, we also show that the protein physically interacts with the transcription factor AP2α, a known inhibitor of adipogenesis, both in vitro and in cells. Interestingly, our data indicate that KCTD1 promotes adipogenesis through the interaction with AP2α and by removing it from the nucleus. Collectively, these findings disclose a novel role for KCTD1 and pave the way for novel strategies aimed at modulating adipogenesis.

Abstract: Microorganisms in animal gut produce unusual fatty acids from the ingested diet. Two types of hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs), 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid (HYA) and 10-hydroxy-octadecanoic acid (HYB), are linoleic acid (LA) metabolites produced by Lactobacillus plantarum. In this study, we investigated the metabolism of these HFAs in mammalian cells. When Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured with HYA, approximately 50% of the supplemented HYA disappeared from the dish within 24 h. On the other hand, the amount of HYA that disappeared from the dish of peroxisome (PEX)-deficient CHO cells was lower than 20%. Significant amounts of C2– and C4-chain-shortened metabolites of HYA were detected in culture medium of HYA-supplemented CHO cells, but not in medium of PEX-deficient cells. These results suggested that peroxisomal β-oxidation is involved in the disappearance of HYA. The PEX-dependent disappearance was observed in the experiment with HYB, but not with LA. We also found that HYA treatment up-regulates peroxisomal β-oxidation activity of human gastric MKN74 cells and intestinal Caco-2 cells. These results indicate a possibility that HFAs produced from gut bacteria affect lipid metabolism of host via modulation of peroxisomal β-oxidation activity.

Endothelial lipase increases antioxidative capacity of high-density lipoprotein,

Abstract: Endothelial lipase (EL) is a strong determinant of structural and functional properties of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). We examined whether the antioxidative capacity of HDL is affected by EL. EL-modified HDL (EL-HDL) and control EV-HDL were generated by incubation of HDL with EL- overexpressing or control HepG2 cells. As determined by native gradient gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering EL-HDL is smaller than EV-HDL. Mass spectrometry revealed an enrichment of EL-HDL with lipolytic products and depletion of phospholipids and triacylglycerol. Kinetics of conjugated diene formation and HPLC-based malondialdehyde quantification revealed that EL-HDL exhibited a significantly higher resistance to copper ion-induced oxidation and a significantly higher capacity to protect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from copper ion-induced oxidation when compared to EV-HDL. Depletion of the lipolytic products from EL-HDL abolished the capacity of EL-HDL to protect LDL from copper ion-induced oxidation, which could be partially restored by lysophosphatidylcholine enrichment. Proteomics of HDL incubated with oxidized LDL revealed significantly higher levels of methionine 136 sulfoxide in EL-HDL compared to EV-HDL. Chloramine T (oxidizes methionines and modifies free thiols), diminished the difference between EL-HDL and EV-HDL regarding the capacity to protect LDL from oxidation. In absence of LDL small EV-HDL and EL-HDL exhibited higher resistance to copper ion-induced oxidation when compared to respective large particles. In conclusion, the augmented antioxidative capacity of EL-HDL is primarily determined by the enrichment of HDL with EL-generated lipolytic products and to a lesser extent by the decreased HDL particle size and the increased activity of chloramine T-sensitive mechanisms.

Abstract: Mature dendritic cells (DCs) play a pathogenic role in atherosclerosis. Our previous study demonstrated that exogenous interleukin (IL)-37 suppresses the maturation of DCs, induces the T-regulatory (Treg) cell response, and attenuates atherosclerosis in ApoE−/− mice. The aim of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanism of IL-37 on the maturation of DCs throughout the development of atherosclerosis. The expression of interleukin-1 receptor 8 (IL-1R8), which is a single Ig-domain receptor that was recently found to be pivotal for the extracellular function of IL-37, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and p65, was measured in ApoE−/− mice and IL-37 transgenic (IL-37tg) ApoE−/− mice. IL-1R8 was mainly expressed in aortic plaque-infiltrated DCs and at significantly higher levels in IL-37tg atherosclerotic mice, accompanied by lower levels of TLR4 and p65. Furthermore, IL-37 eliminated the maturation of DCs induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and caused marked upregulation of IL-1R8 in vitro and downregulation of TLR4 and p65, which was consistent with the experiments in mice. However, the inhibitory effect of IL-37 on the maturation of DCs in vitro was abolished when IL-37 was used to treat DCs isolated from IL-1R8-deficient and TLR4-deficient mice. Therefore, this study indicated that IL-37 inhibited the maturation of DCs via the IL-1R8-TLR4-NF-κB pathway and attenuated atherosclerosis in ApoE−/− mice.

Abstract: Voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1) is a mitochondrial porin that is implicated in cellular metabolism and apoptosis, and modulated by numerous small molecules including lipids. VDAC1 binds sterols, including cholesterol and neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone. Biochemical and computational studies suggest that VDAC1 binds multiple cholesterol molecules, but photolabeling studies have identified only a single cholesterol and neurosteroid binding site at E73. To identify all the binding sites of neurosteroids in VDAC1, we apply photo-affinity labeling using two sterol-based photolabeling reagents with complementary photochemistry: 5α-6-AziP which contains an aliphatic diazirine, and KK200 which contains a trifluoromethyl-phenyldiazirine (TPD) group. 5α-6-AziP and KK200 photolabel multiple residues within an E73 pocket confirming the presence of this site and mapping sterol orientation within this pocket. In addition, KK200 photolabels four other sites consistent with the finding that VDAC1 co-purifies with five cholesterol molecules. Both allopregnanolone and cholesterol competitively prevent photolabeling at E73 and three other sites indicating that these are common sterol binding sites shared by both neurosteroids and cholesterol. Binding at the functionally important residue E73 suggests a possible role for sterols in regulating VDAC1 signaling and interaction with partner proteins.

Abstract: Long-term exposure to hypercholesterolemia induces the development of skin xanthoma's characterized by the accumulation of lipid-laden foam cells in humans and in mice. Early skin changes in response to hypercholesterolemia are however unknown. In this study, we investigated the skin lipid composition and associated barrier function in young adult low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR−/−) and apolipoprotein E knockout (APOE−/−) mice, two commonly used hypercholesterolemic mouse models characterized by the accumulation of apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins. No differences were observed on cholesterol content in the epidermis in LDLR−/− mice nor in the more extremely hypercholesterolemic APOE−/− mice. Interestingly, the free fatty acid profile in the APOE−/− epidermis shifted towards shorter and unsaturated chains. Genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids were downregulated in APOE−/− skin suggesting a compensation for the higher influx of plasma lipids, most probably as cholesteryl esters. Importantly, in vivo transepidermal water loss and permeability studies with murine lipid model membranes revealed that the lipid composition of the APOE−/− skin resulted in a reduced skin barrier function. In conclusion, severe hypercholesterolemia associated with increased apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins affects the epidermal lipid composition and its protective barrier.

Abstract: The cornified lipid envelope (CLE) is a lipid monolayer covalently bound to the outside of corneocytes and is part of the stratum corneum (SC). The CLE is suggested to act as a scaffold for the unbound SC lipids. By profiling the bound CLE ceramides, a new subclass was discovered and identified as an omega-hydroxylated dihydrosphingosine (OdS) ceramide. Bound glucosylceramides were observed in superficial SC layers of healthy human skin. To investigate the relation between bound and unbound SC ceramides, the composition of both fractions was analyzed and compared. Selectivity in ceramide binding towards unsaturated ceramides and ceramides with a shorter chain length was observed. The selectivity in ceramide species bound to the cornified envelope is thought to have a physiological function in corneocyte flexibility. Next, it was examined if skin models exhibit an altered bound ceramide composition and if the composition was dependent on liver X-receptor (LXR) activation. The effects of an LXR agonist and antagonist on the bound ceramides composition of a full thickness model (FTM) were analyzed. In FTMs, a decreased amount of bound ceramides was observed compared to native human skin. Furthermore, FTMs had a bound ceramide fraction which consisted mostly of unsaturated and shorter ceramides. The LXR antagonist had a normalizing effect on the FTM bound ceramide composition. The agonist exhibited minimal effects. We show that ceramide binding is a selective process, yet, still is contingent on lipid synthesized.

Abstract: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), the most frequent peroxisomal disorder, is associated with mutation in the ABCD1 gene which encodes a peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette transporter for very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA). The biochemical hallmark of the disease is the accumulation of VLCFA. Peroxisomal defect in microglia being now considered a priming event in the pathology, we have therefore generated murine microglial cells mutated in the Abcd1 gene and its closest homolog, the Abcd2 gene. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing strategy, we obtained 3 cell clones with a single or double deficiency. As expected, only the combined absence of ABCD1 and ABCD2 proteins resulted in the accumulation of VLCFA. Ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy revealed in the double mutant cells the presence of lipid inclusions similar to those observed in brain macrophages of patients. These observations are likely related to the increased level of cholesterol and the accumulation of neutral lipids that we noticed in mutant cells. A preliminary characterization of the impact of peroxisomal defects on the expression of key microglial genes such as Trem2 suggests profound changes in microglial functions related to inflammation and phagocytosis. The expression levels of presumed modifier genes have also been found modified in mutant cells, making these novel cell lines relevant for use as in vitro models to better understand the physiopathogenesis of X-ALD and to discover new therapeutic targets.

Abstract: The intake of food polyphenols is associated with beneficial impacts on health. Besides anti-oxidative effects, anti-inflammatory properties have been suggested as molecular modes of action, which may result from modulations of the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade. Here, we investigated the effects of a library of food polyphenols on 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) activity in a cell-free assay, and in human neutrophils. Resveratrol, its dimer (ε-viniferin), and its imine analogue (IRA) potently blocked the 5-LOX-mediated LT formation in neutrophils with IC50 values in low μM-range. Among the tested flavonoids only the isoflavone genistein showed potent 5-LOX inhibition in neutrophils (IC50 = 0.4 ± 0.1 μM), however was ineffective on isolated 5-LOX. We exclude an interference with the 5-LOX-activating protein (FLAP) in HEK_5-LOX/±FLAP cells and suggest global effects on intact immune cells. Using LC-MS based targeted oxylipin metabolomics, we analyzed the effects of 5-LOX-inhibiting polyphenols on all branches of the AA cascade in Ca2+-ionophore-challenged neutrophils. While ε-viniferin causes a clear substrate shunt towards the remaining AA cascade enzymes (15-LOX, cyclooxygenase – COX-1/2, cytochrome P450), resveratrol inhibited the COX-1/2 pathway and showed a weak attenuation of 12/15-LOX activity. IRA had no impact on 15-LOX activity, but elevated the formation of COX-derived prostaglandins, having no inhibitory effects on COX-1/2. Overall, we show that food polyphenols have the ability to block 5-LOX activity and the oxylipin pattern is modulated with a remarkable compound/structural specificity. Taken the importance of polyphenols for a healthy diet and their concentration in food supplements into account, this finding justifies further investigation.

Abstract: In Neisseria sp., SGNH family esterases are involved in bacterial pathogenesis as well as cell wall peptidoglycan maturation. Here, a novel enantioselective SGNH family esterase (NmSGNH1) from Neisseria meningitidis, which has sequence similarity to carbohydrate esterase (CE3) family, was catalytically characterized and functionally explored. NmSGNH1 exhibited a wide range of substrate specificities including naproxol acetate, tert-butyl acetate, glucose pentaacetate as well as p-nitrophenyl esters. Deletion of C-terminal residues (NmSGNH1Δ11) led to the altered substrate specificity, reduced catalytic activity, and increased thermostability. Furthermore, a hydrophobic residue of Leu92 in the substrate-binding pocket was identified to be critical in catalytic activity, thermostability, kinetics, and enantioselectivity. Interestingly, immobilization of NmSGNH1 by hybrid nanoflowers (hNFs) and crosslinked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) showed increased level of activity, recycling property, and enhanced stability. Finally, synthesis of butyl acetate, oleic acid esters, and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were verified. In summary, this work provides a molecular understanding of substrate specificities, catalytic regulation, immobilization, and industrial applications of a novel SGNH family esterase from Neisseria meningitidis.

Abstract: Exosomes have been demonstrated to be one of the mechanisms mediating the release of intracellular signaling molecules to conduct cell-to-cell communication. However, it remains unknown whether and how exosomes mediate the release of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome products such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) from endothelial cells. The present study hypothesized that lysosomal acid ceramidase (AC) determines the fate of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) to control the exosome-mediated release of NLRP3 inflammasome products during hyperglycemia. Using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mouse model, we found that endothelium-specific AC gene knockout mice (Asah1fl/fl/ECcre) significantly enhanced the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in coronary arterial ECs (CECs). These mice also had increased thickening of the coronary arterial wall and reduced expression of tight junction protein compared to wild-type (WT/WT) littermates. We also observed the expression of exosome markers such as CD63 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was augmented in STZ-treated Asah1fl/fl/ECcre mice compared to WT/WT mice, which was accompanied by an increased IL-1β release of exosomes. In the primary cultures of CECs, we demonstrated that AC deficiency markedly enhanced the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, but significantly down-regulated tight junction proteins when these cells were exposed to high levels of glucose. The CECs from Asah1fl/fl/ECcre mice had decreased MVB-lysosome interaction and increased IL-1β–containing exosome release in response to high glucose stimulation. Together, these results suggest that AC importantly controls exosome-mediated release of NLRP3 inflammasome products in CECs, which is enhanced by AC deficiency leading to aggravated arterial inflammatory response during hyperglycemia.

Ursodeoxycholic acid is a GPBAR1 agonist and resets liver/intestinal FXR signaling in a model of diet-induced dysbiosis and NASH,

Abstract: Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) ligand, shown effective in reducing steatosis and fibrosis in NASH patients. However, OCA causes major side effects including pruritus, while increases the risk for liver decompensation in cirrhotic patients. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), is a safe and unexpensive bile acid used in the treatment of liver disorders whose mechanism of action is poorly defined. Here we have compared the effects of OCA and UDCA in a mouse model of NASH. In mice exposed to a diet rich in fat/cholesterol and fructose (HFD-F), treatment with OCA or UDCA effectively prevented body weight gain, insulin resistance, as demonstrated by OGTT, and AST plasma levels. After 12 weeks HFD-F mice developed liver microvesicular steatosis, inflammation and mild fibrosis, increased expression of inflammatory (TNFα, IL6, F4/80) and fibrosis (αSma, Col1α1, Tgfβ) markers, reduced liver expression of FXR, dysregulated liver FXR signaling and elevated levels of Tauro-α and β-muricholic acid (T-α and βMCA), two FXR antagonists in mice. Both compounds prevented these changes and improved liver histopathology. OCA reduced primary bile acid synthesis worsening the T-CA/T-βMCA ratio. UDCA effectively transactivated GPBAR1 in vitro. By RNAseq analysis we found that among over 2400 genes modulated by the HFD-F, only 32 and 60 genes were modulated by OCA and UDCA, with only 3 genes (Dbp, Adh7, Osgin1) being modulated by both agents. Both agents partially prevented the intestinal dysbiosis.
Conclusions
UDCA is a GPBAR1 ligand and exerts beneficial effects in a rodent model of NASH by activating non-overlapping pathway with OCA.

Abstract: Bis(Monoacylglycero) Phosphate (BMP) is a unique phospholipid localized in late endosomes, a critical cellular compartment in low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol metabolism. In previous work, we demonstrated the important role of BMP in the regulation of macrophage cholesterol homeostasis. BMP exerts a protective role against the pro-apoptotic effect of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) by reducing the production of deleterious oxysterols. As the intracellular sterol traffic in macrophages is in part regulated by oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) and OSBP-related proteins (ORPs), we investigated the role of ORP11, localized at the Golgi-late endosomes interface, in the BMP-mediated protection from oxLDL/oxysterol cytotoxicity. Stably silencing of ORP11 in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages via a shRNA lentiviruses system had no effect on BMP production. However, ORP11 knockdown abrogated the protective action of BMP against oxLDL induced apoptosis. In oxLDL treated control cells, BMP enrichment was associated with reduced generation of 7-oxysterols, while these oxysterol species were abundant in the ORP11 knock-down cells. Of note, BMP enrichment in ORP11 knock-down cells was associated with a drastic increase in free cholesterol and linked to a decrease of cholesterol efflux. The expression of ATP-binding cassette-transporter G1 (ABCG1) was also reduced in the ORP11 knock-down cells. These observations demonstrate a cooperative function of OPR11 and BMP, in intracellular cholesterol trafficking in cultured macrophages. We suggest that BMP favors the egress of cholesterol from late endosomes via an ORP11-dependent mechanism, resulting in a reduced production of cytotoxic 7-oxysterols.

Abstract: Increased phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity has been found to be associated with obesity, and metabolic syndrome in humans. However, whether or not PLTP has a direct effect on insulin sensitivity and obesity is largely unknown. Here we analyzed the effect by using PLTP knockout (PLTP−/−) mouse model. Although, PLTP−/− mice have normal body-weight-gain under chow diet, these mice were protected from high-fat-diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, compared with wild type mice. In order to understand the mechanism, we evaluated insulin receptor and Akt activation and found that PLTP deficiency significantly enhanced phosphorylated insulin receptor and Akt levels in high-fat-diet fed mouse livers, adipose tissues, and muscles after insulin stimulation, while total Akt and insulin receptor levels were unchanged. Moreover, we found that the PLTP deficiency induced significantly more GLUT4 protein in the plasma membranes of adipocytes and muscle cells after insulin stimulation. Finally, we found that PLTP-deficient hepatocytes had less sphingomyelins and free cholesterols in the lipid rafts and plasma membranes than that of controls and this may provide a molecular basis for PLTP deficiency-mediated increase in insulin sensitivity. We have concluded that PLTP deficiency leads to an improvement in tissue and whole-body insulin sensitivity through modulating lipid levels in the plasma membrane, especially in the lipid rafts.

Abstract: Sphingosine kinases (SPHK) generate the sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate, which, among other functions, is a potent regulator of inflammation. While SPHK1 produces S1P to promote inflammatory signaling, the role of SPHK2 is unclear due to divergent findings in studies utilizing gene depletion versus inhibition of catalytic activity. We sought to clarify how SPHK2 affects inflammatory signaling in human macrophages, which are main regulators of inflammation. SPHK2 expression and activity were rapidly decreased within 6 h upon stimulating primary human macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but was upregulated after 24 h. At 24 h following LPS stimulation, targeting SPHK2 with the inhibitor ABC294640, a specific siRNA or by using Sphk2−/− mouse peritoneal macrophages increased inflammatory cytokine production. Downregulation of SPHK2 in primary human macrophages within 6 h of LPS treatment was blocked by inhibiting autophagy. SPHK2 overexpression or inhibiting autophagy 6 h after human macrophage activation with LPS suppressed inflammatory cytokine release. Mechanistically, SPHK2 suppressed LPS-triggered NF-κB activation independent of its catalytic activity and prevented increased mitochondrial ROS formation downstream of LPS. In conclusion, SPHK2 is an anti-inflammatory protein in human macrophages that is inversely coupled to inflammatory cytokine production. This needs consideration when targeting SPHK2 with specific inhibitors.

Abstract: Platelets are collected for transfusion to patients with different haematological disorders, and for logistical reasons, platelets are stored as concentrates. Despite carefully controlled conditions, platelets become activated during storage, and platelet concentrates (PlaCs) may cause adverse inflammatory reactions in recipients. The time-dependent changes in the lipidome of clinical PlaCs, platelets isolated from PlaCs, and extracellular vesicles (EVs) thereof were examined by mass spectrometry. The relative amount of arachidonic acid containing glycerophospholipids, especially those in the phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine classes during storage, but the relative amount of other polyunsaturated fatty acid containing glycerophospholipids remained stable in all sample types. These changes were not directly translated to lipid mediator (LM) profile since the levels of arachidonic acid-derived proinflammatory LMs were not specifically elevated. Instead, several monohydroxy pathway markers and functionally relevant LMs, both proinflammatory and proresolving, were detected in the PlaCs and the EVs, and some representatives of both kind clearly accumulated during storage. By Western blot, the key enzymes of these pathways were shown to be present in platelets, and in many cases, EVs. Since the EVs were enriched in the fatty acid precursors of LMs in their (phospholipid) membranes, harboured LM-producing enzymes, contained the related monohydroxy pathway markers, and secreted the final LM products, PlaC-derived EVs could participate in the regulation of inflammation and healing, and thereby aid the platelets in exerting their essential physiological functions.

Abstract: Lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) incorporate a fatty acid into the hydroxyl group of lysophospholipids (LPLs) and are critical for determining the fatty acid composition of phospholipids. Previous studies have focused mainly on their molecular identification and their substrate specificity regarding the polar head groups and acyl-CoAs. However, little is known about the positional specificity of the hydroxyl group of the glycerol backbone (sn-2 or sn-1) at which LPLATs introduce a fatty acid. This is mainly due to the instability of LPLs used as an acceptor, especially for LPLs with a fatty acid at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone (sn-2-LPLs), which are essential for the enzymatic assay to determine the positional specificity. In this study, we established a method to determine the positional specificity of LPLAT by preparing stable sn-2-LPLs in combination with PLA2 digestion, and applied the method for determining the positional specificity of several LPLATs including LPCAT1, LYCAT and LPCAT3. We found that LPCAT1 introduced palmitic acid both at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of palmitoyl-LPC, while LYCAT and LPCAT3 specifically introduced stearic acid at the sn-1 position of LPG and arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position of LPC, respectively. The present method for evaluating the positional specificity could also be used for biochemical characterization of other LPLATs.

Abstract: Medium-chain-triglycerides (MCT) are widely applied in the treatment of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (lcFAOD). Long-term treatment with MCT led to a sexually dimorphic response in the mouse model of very-long-chain-acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase-deficiency (VLCAD−/−) with the subsequent development of a metabolic syndrome in female mice. In order to evaluate the molecular mechanisms responsible for this sex specific response we performed a comprehensive metabolic phenotyping, SILAC-based quantitative proteomics and characterized the involved signaling pathways by western blot analysis and gene expression. WT and VLCAD−/− mice showed strong sex-dependent differences in basal metabolism and expression of proteins involved in the distinct metabolic pathways, even more prominent after treatment with octanoate. The investigation of molecular mechanisms responsible for the sexual dimorphisms delineated the selective activation of the ERK/mTORc1 signaling pathway leading to an increased biosynthesis and elongation of fatty acids in VLCAD−/− females. In contrast, octanoate induced the activation of ERK/PPARγ pathway and the subsequent upregulation of peroxisomal β‑oxidation in males. We here provide first evidence that sex has to be considered as important variable in disease phenotype. These findings may have implications on treatment strategies in the different sexes.

Abstract: Naringenin improves lipoprotein profile and protects against cardiovascular disease. ATF6 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor with the same activation processes with sterol regulator SREBPs. Clinical data revealed that ATF6 expression was associated with plasma cholesterol level. Here, we investigated whether naringenin was involved in the regulation of cholesterol efflux and tested the role of ER stress-ATF6 in the naringenin function. Results showed that naringenin increased cholesterol efflux to both apoA-I and HDL and gene expressions in ABCA1, ABCG1 and LXRα in RAW264.7 macrophages. Naringenin inhibited the cleaved ATF6 nuclear translocation and its target GRP78 and XBP-1 expressions. Naringenin-induced cholesterol efflux was modulated by treatment with ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid, inducer tunicamycin and ATF6 overexpression in RAW264.7 and/or THP-1 cells, which suggested the naringenin functions were mediated through inhibiting ER stress-ATF6 pathway. Next, we found high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with naringenin increased by >1.2-fold in cholesterol efflux capacity in primary peritoneal macrophage in apoE−/− mice compared to only HFD-fed mice. The increase was significantly reduced by tunicamycin treatment. Naringenin decreased GRP78, XBP-1 and nuclear ATF6 levels in peritoneal macrophage and aorta and reduced atherosclerotic lesion at aortic root, but reversed by tunicamycin. These confirmed participation of ER stress-ATF6 in naringenin efficacy. Finally, we found naringenin promoted AKT phosphorylation; PI3K inhibitor LY294002 treatment increased nuclear ATF6 and reduced naringenin-enhanced ABCA1 expression and cholesterol efflux. We concluded naringenin as a regulator for cholesterol efflux, and the regulation was mediated by ATF6 branch of ER stress and PI3K/AKT pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Transforming growth factor β induced factor homeobox (TGIF) 1 and 2 are two transcriptional repressors. Although TGIF1 has been found to be involved in lipid metabolism, no studies have yet investigated the role of TGIF2 in hepatic lipid metabolism. Here we aim to investigate effects on hepatic lipid metabolism following overexpression of the human and mouse TGIF1 and TGIF2 protein. We used modified mRNA molecules to transiently enhance the expression of these proteins in human hepatoma cells. We found all the mRNA molecules to be translated, except the one for human TGIF1. Transient transfection with the mouse TGIF1 mRNA molecules lowered levels of cholesterol (p < 0.001), triglycerides (p < 0.001), and apolipoprotein B (p < 0.05) in the cell media by ~40%, along with the mRNA levels of some key genes involved in lipid metabolism. In contrast, limited effects on these parameters were observed following transient transfection with the human and mouse TGIF2 mRNA molecules. To enable investigation of the effects following enhanced expression of the human TGIF1 protein, we stably overexpressed this protein in human hepatoma cells. In line with the above findings, we found cells stably overexpressing the human TGIF1 protein had lower levels of cholesterol (p < 0.05), triglycerides (p < 0.05) and apolipoprotein B (p < 0.05) in the cell media by ~30%. Hence, transient and stable overexpression of the TGIF1 protein appears to lead to an advantageous lipid profile.

Abstract: Although human adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) has been considered a promising source of stem cells, its characteristics relevant to treatment of a damaged liver have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we sought to characterize the property of human SVF and determine the therapeutic utility of SVF in the liver cirrhosis model. We performed microarray, quantitative (q)-PCR experiments, and in vivo therapeutic assays using a liver cirrhotic mouse model. q-PCR results revealed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, Interleukin (IL)-10 and microRNA (miR)-146 were more highly upregulated in SVF than in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). The SVF culture medium (CM) inhibited the activation of hepatic stellate cells in vitro. Injection of SVF significantly suppressed TAA-induced liver fibrosis and repaired liver function by inhibition of infiltrating inflammatory cells and induction of capillary/hepatocyte regeneration in vivo. Injection of IL-10 siRNA treated SVF cells decreased anti-inflammation and anti-fibrotic effects in TAA-induced mice liver. Our data indicate that SVF show a high anti-inflammatory property for treating fibrotic liver diseases through IL-10 secretion. Therefore, SVF might be a novel therapeutic alternative for the treatment of liver cirrhosis in clinical settings.

Abstract: Proteins harboring peroxisome-targeting signal type-2 (PTS2) are recognized in the cytosol by mobile PTS2 receptor Pex7p and associate with a longer isoform Pex5pL of the PTS1 receptor. Trimeric PTS2 protein-Pex7p-Pex5pL complexes are translocated to peroxisomes in mammalian cells. However, it remains unclear whether Pex5pL and Pex7p are sufficient cytosolic components in transporting of PTS2 proteins to peroxisomes. Here, we construct a semi-intact cell import system to define the cytosolic components required for the peroxisomal PTS2 protein import and show that the PTS2 pre-import complexes comprising Pex7p, Pex5p, and Hsc70 isolated from the cytosol of pex14 Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant ZP161 is import-competent. PTS2 reporter proteins are transported to peroxisomes by recombinant Pex7p and Pex5pL in semi-intact cells devoid of the cytosol. Furthermore, PTS2 proteins are translocated to peroxisomes in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, adenylyl imidodiphosphate, and N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting that ATP-dependent chaperones including Hsc70 are dispensable for PTS2 protein import. Taken together, we suggest that Pex7p and Pex5pL are the minimal cytosolic factors in the transport of PTS2 proteins to peroxisomes.

Abstract: Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) catalyzes more than half of all phosphoserine/threonine dephosphorylation reactions in mammalian cells. In vivo PP1 does not exist as a free catalytic subunit but is always associated with at least one regulatory PP1-interacting protein (PIP) to generate a large set of distinct holoenzymes. Each PP1 complex controls the dephosphorylation of only a small subset of PP1 substrates. We screened the literature for genetically engineered mouse models and identified models for all PP1 isoforms and 104 PIPs. PP1 itself and at least 49 PIPs were connected to human disease-associated phenotypes. Additionally, phenotypes related to 17 PIPs were clearly linked to altered PP1 function, while such information was lacking for 32 other PIPs. We propose structural reverse genetics, which combines structural characterization of proteins with mouse genetics, to identify new PP1-related therapeutic targets. The available mouse models confirm the pleiotropic action of PP1 in health and diseases.

Abstract: Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) store vitamin A as retinyl esters and control circulating retinol levels. Upon liver injury, quiescent (q)HSC lose their vitamin A and transdifferentiate to myofibroblasts, e.g. activated (a)HSC, which promote fibrosis by producing excessive extracellular matrix. Adipose triglyceride lipase/patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 2 (ATGL/PNPLA2) and adiponutrin (ADPN/PNPLA3) have so far been shown to mobilize retinol from retinyl esters in HSC. Here, we studied the putative role of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL/LIPE) in HSC, as it is the major retinyl ester hydrolase (REH) in adipose tissue. Lipe/HSL expression was analyzed in rat liver and primary human and rat qHSC and culture-activated aHSC. Retinyl hydrolysis was analyzed after Isoproterenol-mediated phosphorylation/activation of HSL. Primary human HSC contain 2.5-fold higher LIPE mRNA levels compared to hepatocytes. Healthy rat liver contains significant mRNA and protein levels of HSL/Lipe, which predominates in qHSC and cells of the portal tree. Q-PCR comparison indicates that Lipe mRNA levels in qHSC are dominant over Pnpla2 and Pnpla3. HSL is mostly phosphorylated/activated in qHSC and partly colocalizes with vitamin A-containing lipid droplets. Lipe/HSL and Pnpla3 expression is rapidly lost during HSC culture-activation, while Pnpla2 expression is maintained. HSL super-activation by isoproterenol accelerates loss of lipid droplets and retinyl palmitate from HSC, which coincided with a small, but significant reduction in HSC proliferation and suppression of Collagen1A1 mRNA and protein levels. In conclusion, HSL participates in vitamin A metabolism in qHSC. Equivalent activities of ATGL and ADPN provide the healthy liver with multiple routes to control circulating retinol levels.

Abstract: Hypercholesterolemia is a preventable risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms of diosgenin (DG) that promote cholesterol homeostasis and alleviate hypercholesterolemia remain elusive. To investigate the effects and molecular mechanisms of the promotion of cholesterol metabolism by DG, a rat model of hypercholesterolemia was induced by providing a high-fat diet for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the rats were intragastrically administered high-dose DG (0.3 g/kg/d), low-dose DG (0.15 g/kg/d) or simvastatin (4 mg/kg/d) once a day for 8 weeks. The serum and hepatic cholesterol were tested, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), liver X receptor-α (LXR-α) and the ATP-binding cassette G5/G8 (ABCG5/G8) transporters were measured. The results indicate that DG could reduce body weight, decrease the serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, liver total cholesterol and free cholesterol levels compared to those in the controls. Simultaneously, liver tissue pathological morphology analyses revealed that DG could attenuate hepatic steatosis compared to that in the high-fat diet group. Further investigation demonstrated that DG significantly decreased the expression of NPC1L1 and LXR-α in the intestine and markedly increased the expression of ABCG5/G8 in the liver and intestine. Compared to the high-fat diet group, the rats in the DG-treated groups ameliorated hypercholesterolemia in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These data suggest that DG may not only inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption by downregulating NPC1L1 but also enhance cholesterol excretion by increasing the expression of ABCG5/G8. DG could be a new candidate for the prevention of hypercholesterolemia.

Doublecortin X (DCX) serine 28 phosphorylation is a regulatory switch, modulating association of DCX with microtubules and actin filaments,

Abstract: Doublecortin X (DCX) plays essential roles in neuronal development via its regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics. This is mediated through direct interactions between its doublecortin (DC) domains (DC1 and DC2) with microtubules (MTs) and indirect association with actin filaments (F-ACT). While the regulatory role of the DCX C-terminus following DC2 (i.e. DCX residues 275–366) has been established, less is known of the possible contributions made by the DCX N-terminus preceding DC1 (i.e. DCX residues 1–44). Here, we assessed the influence of DCX Ser28 within the DCX N-terminus, on the association of DCX with MTs and F-ACT. We compared the cytoskeletal interactions of the DCX S28E phosphomimetic and DCX S28A phospho-resistant mutants and wild-type DCX. Immunoprecipitation and colocalisation analyses indicated increased association of DCX S28E with F-ACT but decreased interaction with MTs, and conversely enhanced DCX S28A association with MTs but decreased association with F-ACT. To evaluate the impact of DCX mutants on cytoskeletal filaments we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies on SiR-tubulin and β-actin-mCherry and observed comparable tubulin and actin exchange rates in the presence of DCX WT and DCX S28A. However, we observed faster tubulin exchange rates but slower actin exchange rates in the presence of DCX S28E. Moreover, DCX S28E enhanced the association with the actin-binding protein spinophilin (Spn) suggesting the shift to favour association with both F-ACT and Spn in the presence of DCX S28E. Taken together, our results highlight a new role for DCX S28 as a regulatory switch for cytoskeletal organisation.

Abstract: In cyanobacteria, increasing growth temperature decreases lipid unsaturation and the ratio of monomer/trimer photosystem I (PSI) complexes. In the present study we applied Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and lipidomic analysis to study the effects of PSI monomer/oligomer ratio on the physical properties and lipid composition of thylakoids. To enhance the presence of monomeric PSI, a Synechocystis sp. PCC6803/ΔpsaL mutant strain (PsaL) was used which, unlike both trimeric and monomeric PSI-containing wild type (WT) cells, contain only the monomeric form. The protein-to-lipid ratio remained unchanged in the mutant but, due to an increase in the lipid disorder in its thylakoids, the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition temperature (Tm) is lower than in the WT. In thylakoid membranes of the mutant, digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), the most abundant bilayer-forming lipid is accumulated, whereas those in the WT contain more monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), the only non-bilayer-forming lipid in cyanobacteria. In PsaL cells, the unsaturation level of sulphoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), a regulatory anionic lipid, has increased. It seems that merely a change in the oligomerization level of a membrane protein complex (PSI), and thus the altered protein-lipid interface, can affect the lipid composition and, in addition, the whole dynamics of the membrane. Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis has shown that in PsaL thylakoidal protein-lipid interactions are less stable than in the WT, and proteins start losing their native secondary structure at much milder lipid packing perturbations. Conclusions drawn from this system should be generally applicable for protein-lipid interactions in biological membranes.

Abstract: The intracellular transport of lipophilic cargoes is a highly dynamic process. In eukaryotic cells, the uptake and release of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are executed by fatty-acid binding proteins. However, how these carriers control the directionality of cargo trafficking remains unclear. Here, we revealed that the unliganded archetypal Drosophila brain-type fatty acid-binding protein (dFABP) possesses a stronger binding affinity than its liganded counterpart for empty nanodiscs (ND). Titrating unliganded dFABP and nanodiscs with LCFAs rescued the broadening of FABP cross-peak intensities in HSQC spectra from a weakened protein–membrane interaction. Two out of the 3 strongest LCFA contacting residues in dFABP identified by NMR HSQC chemical shift perturbation (CSP) are also part of the 30 ND-contacting residues (out of the total 130 residues in dFABP), revealed by attenuated TROSY signal in the presence of lipid ND to apo-like dFABP. Our crystallographic temperature factor data suggest enhanced αII helix dynamics upon LCFA binding, compensating for the entropic loss in the βC-D/βE-F loops. The aliphatic tail of bound LCFA impedes the charge-charge interaction between dFABP and the head groups of the membrane, and dFABP is prone to dissociate from the membrane upon ligand binding. We therefore conclude that lipophilic ligands participate directly in the control of the functionally required membrane association and dissociation of FABPs.

Abstract: Background
Bile acids (BAs) participate in lipid absorption and serve as metabolic regulatory factors in gut-liver communication. To date, there are no studies on the systemic patterns of BAs in the serum, liver, and gut in the same non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model.
Methods
A targeted metabolomics approach and 16S rRNA sequencing were used to identify the profile of BAs and connection between BAs and microbiota. The role and mechanism of altered BAs on hepatic steatosis were investigated.
Findings
In the liver, the composition of taurocholic acid (TCA) was increased, but taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) were decreased. In the gut, the deconjugated form of TCA (cholic acid (CA)) was increased, while the deconjugated forms of THDCA (α-hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA)) and ω-muricholic acid (ωMCA) were decreased. In the serum, the composition of TCA was increased, while both HDCA and THDCA were decreased. THDCA induced the gene expression of apolipoprotein, bile secretion-related proteins, and cytochrome P450 family but suppressed inflammatory response genes expression in steatotic hepatocytes by RNAseq analysis. THDCA ameliorated neutral lipid accumulation and improved insulin sensitivity in primary rat hepatocytes. The decreased HDCA level correlated with the level of Bacteroidetes, while the level of CA correlated with the levels of Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia but correlated inversely with Bacteroidetes.
Conclusion
BAs profiles in the serum, liver and caecal content were altered in a rat NAFLD model, which may affect hepatic lipid accumulation and correlate with gut dysbiosis.

Abstract: Oxysterols, oxidization products of cholesterol, are regarded as bioactive lipids affecting various physiological functions. However, little is known of their effects on ion channels. Using inside-out patch clamp recording, we found that naturally occurring side-chain oxidized oxysterols, 20S‑hydroxycholesterol, 22R‑hydroxycholesterol, 24S‑hydroxycholestero, 25‑hydroxycholesterol, and 27‑hydroxycholesterol, induced current reduction of large-conductance Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ (slo1 BK) channels heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells. In contrast with side-chain oxidized oxysterols, naturally occurring ring oxidized ones, 7α‑hydroxycholesterol and 7‑ketocholesterol were without effect. By using 24S‑hydroxycholesterol (24S‑HC), the major brain oxysterol, we explored the inhibition mechanism. 24S‑HC inhibited Slo1 BK channels with an IC50 of ~2 μM, and decreased macroscopic current by ~60%. This marked current decrease was accompanied by a rightward shift in the conductance-voltage relationship and a slowed activation kinetics, with the deactivation kinetics unaltered. Furthermore, the membrane sterol scavenger γ‑cyclodextrin was found to rescue slo1 BK channels from the inhibition, implicating that 24S-HC may be intercalated into the plasma membrane to affect the channel. These findings unveil a novel physiological importance of oxysterols from a new angle that involves ion channel regulation.

Abstract: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1) acts as an endonuclease that degrades selected mRNAs, viral RNAs and pre-miRNAs. MCPIP1 inhibits adipogenesis by degradation of C/EBPβ mRNA and adipogenesis-related miRNA, however its role in the regulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of MCPIP1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 2–20 weeks and next primary hepatocytes and adipose tissue were isolated. For in vitro experiments we used murine primary hepatocytes, control HepG2 cells and HepG2 with overexpressed or silenced MCPIP1. We found that Mcpip1 levels were lower in primary hepatocytes isolated from HFD-fed mice than in control cells starting at 4 weeks of a HFD. Level of Mcpip1 was also depleted in visceral fat isolated from obese and glucose-intolerant mice characterized by fatty liver disease. We showed that MCPIP1 overexpression in HepG2 cells treated with oleate induces the level and activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). This phenotype was reverted upon silencing of MCPIP1 in HepG2 cells and in primary hepatocytes lacking Mcpip1 protein. MCPIP1 activated the PPARγ transcription factor via the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1- α (PGC-1α) pathway. MCPIP1 contributes to lipid metabolism in hepatocytes by regulating the TXNIP/PGC-1α/PPARγ pathway.

Abstract: Autophagy is a degradative cellular pathway that protects eukaryotic cells from starvation/stress. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, Pik1p and Stt4p, are indispensable for autophagy in budding yeast, but participation of PtdIns-4 kinases and their product, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PtdIns(4)P], is not understood. Nanoscale membrane lipid distribution analysis showed PtdIns(4)P is more abundant in yeast autophagosomes in the luminal leaflet than the cytoplasmic leaflet. PtdIns(4)P is confined to the cytoplasmic leaflet of autophagosomal inner and outer membranes in mammalian cells. Using temperature-conditional single PIK1 or STT4 PtdIns 4-kinase mutants, autophagic bodies in the vacuole of PIK1 and STT4 mutant cells dramatically decreased at restrictive temperatures, and the number of autophagosomes in the cytosol of PIK1 mutants cells was also decreased, whereas autophagosome levels of STT4 mutant cells were comparable to that of wild-type and STT4 mutant cells at permissive temperatures. Localization of PtdIns(4)P in the luminal leaflet in the biological membrane is a novel finding, and differences in PtdIns(4)P distribution suggest substantial differences between yeast and mammals. We also demonstrate in this study that Pik1p and Stt4p play essential roles in autophagosome formation and autophagosome–vacuole fusion in yeast cells, respectively.

Abstract: Decreased levels of the δ isozyme of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) in skeletal muscle attenuate glucose uptake and, consequently, are critical for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. We recently found that free myristic acid (14:0), but not free palmitic acid (16:0), increased the DGKδ protein levels and enhanced glucose uptake in C2C12 myotube cells. However, it has been unclear how myristic acid regulates the level of DGKδ2 protein. In the present study, we characterized the myristic acid-dependent increase of DGKδ protein. A cycloheximide chase assay demonstrated that myristic acid, but not palmitic acid, markedly stabilized DGKδ protein. Moreover, other DGK isozymes, DGKη and ζ, as well as glucose uptake-related proteins, such as protein kinase C (PKC) α, PKCζ, Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3β, failed to be stabilized by myristic acid. Furthermore, DGKδ was not stabilized in cultured hepatocellular carcinoma cells, pancreas carcinoma cells or neuroblastoma cells, and only a moderate stabilizing effect was observed in embryonic kidney cells. A proteasome inhibitor and a lysosome inhibitor, MG132 and chloroquine, respectively, partly inhibited DGKδ degradation, suggesting that myristic acid prevents, at least in part, the degradation of DGKδ by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Overall, these results strongly suggest that myristic acid attenuates DGKδ protein degradation in skeletal muscle cells and that this attenuation is fatty acid-, protein- and cell line-specific. These new findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: N-Acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) are known to be precursors of bioactive N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), including the endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) and anti-inflammatory palmitoylethanolamide. In mammals, NAPEs are produced by N-acyltransferases, which transfer an acyl chain from the sn-1 position of glycerophospholipid to the amino group of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Recently, the ɛ isoform of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2ɛ) was found to be Ca2+-dependent N-acyltransferase. However, it was poorly understood which types of phospholipids serve as substrates in living cells. In the present study, we established a human embryonic kidney 293 cell line, in which doxycycline potently induces human cPLA2ɛ, and used these cells to analyze endogenous substrates and products of cPLA2ɛ with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. When treated with doxycycline and Ca2+ ionophore, the cells produced various species of diacyl- and alkenylacyl-types of NAPEs as well as NAEs in large quantities. Moreover, the levels of diacyl- and alkenylacyl-types of PEs and diacyl-phosphatidylcholines (PCs) decreased, while those of lysophosphatidylethanolamines and lysophosphatidylcholines increased. These results suggested that cPLA2ɛ Ca2+-dependently produces NAPEs by utilizing endogenous diacyl- and alkenylacyl-types of PEs as acyl acceptors and diacyl-type PCs and diacyl-type PEs as acyl donors.

Abstract: The regulation of lipid droplet (LD) dynamics by autophagy in naïve macrophages is complex: Inhibiting autophagosome initiation steps attenuates oleic acid (OA) induced LD (OA-LD) biogenesis, whereas interfering with later-autophagosome maturation/lysosomal steps accelerates OA-LD biogenesis rate, but not OA-LD degradation. Here we hypothesized that regulation of macrophage lipid handling by autophagy may be lipid-substrate and activation-state-specific. Using automated quantitative live-cell imaging, initial LD biogenesis rate was ~30% slower when the lipid source was acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL) compared to OA. Yet, both were similarly affected by triacsin-C, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthase, which inhibited, and etomoxir, an inhibitor of acylcarnitine palmitoyl transferase (fatty acid oxidation), which augmented, LD biogenesis rates. An autophagy inducing peptide, Tat-Beclin1, enhanced the degradation, and inhibited (by 37%) the biogenesis of acLDL induced LD (acLDL-LD). Yet, Tat-Beclin1 increased OA-LD biogenesis rate by 70%. When macrophages were pre-activated with LPS + INFG they exhibited increased autophagosome number and area, and reduced BECN1 and ATG14 protein levels, which associated with a markedly attenuated autophagic flux. Concomitantly, OA-LD and acLDL-LD biogenesis rates increased 3 and 7.4-fold, respectively, but could not be further modulated by Tat-Beclin1, as observed in non-activated/naïve macrophages. We propose that macrophage autophagy, and/or components of its machinery, differentially regulate LD/foam-cell biogenesis depending on the lipid-source, and that inflammatory activation uncouples autophagy from LD biogenesis.

Abstract: Although SREBP-1c regulates key enzymes required for hepatic de novo lipogenesis, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of SREBP-1c in pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver is still incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of ERRγ in alcohol-mediated hepatic lipogenesis and examined the possibility to ameliorate alcoholic fatty liver through its inverse agonist. Hepatic ERRγ and SREBP-1c expression was increased by alcohol-mediated activation of CB1 receptor signaling. Deletion and mutation analyses of the Srebp-1c gene promoter showed that ERRγ directly regulates Srebp-1c gene transcription via binding to an ERR-response element. Overexpression of ERRγ significantly induced SREBP-1c expression and fat accumulation in liver of mice, which were blocked in Srebp-1c-knockout hepatocytes. Conversely, liver-specific ablation of ERRγ gene expression attenuated alcohol-mediated induction of SREBP-1c expression. Finally, an ERRγ inverse agonist, GSK5182, significantly ameliorates fatty liver disease in chronically alcohol-fed mice through inhibition of SREBP-1c-mediated fat accumulation. ERRγ mediates alcohol-induced hepatic lipogenesis by upregulating SREBP-1c expression, which can be blunted by the inverse agonist for ERRγ, which may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of alcoholic fatty liver disease in human.

Abstract: Exchange protein activated by cyclic AMP (EPAC1) suppresses multiple inflammatory actions in vascular endothelial cells (VECs), partly due to its ability to induce expression of the suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) gene, the protein product of which inhibits interleukin 6 (IL6) signalling through the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Here, for the first time, we use the non-cyclic nucleotide EPAC1 agonist, I942, to determine its actions on cellular EPAC1 activity and cyclic AMP-regulated gene expression in VECs. We demonstrate that I942 promotes EPAC1 and Rap1 activation in HEK293T cells and induces SOCS3 expression and suppresses IL6-stimulated JAK/STAT3 signalling in HUVECs. SOCS3 induction by I942 in HUVECs was blocked by the EPAC1 antagonist, ESI-09, and EPAC1 siRNA, but not by the broad-spectrum protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H89, indicating that I942 regulates SOCS3 gene expression through EPAC1. RNA sequencing was carried out to further identify I942-regulated genes in HUVECs. This identified 425 I942-regulated genes that were also regulated by the EPAC1-selective cyclic AMP analogue, 007, and the cyclic AMP-elevating agents, forskolin and rolipram (F/R). The majority of genes identified were suppressed by I942, 007 and F/R treatment and many were involved in the control of key vascular functions, including the gene for the cell adhesion molecule, VCAM1. I942 and 007 also inhibited IL6-induced expression of VCAM1 at the protein level and blocked VCAM1-dependent monocyte adhesion to HUVECs. Overall, I942 represents the first non-cyclic nucleotide EPAC1 agonist in cells with the ability to suppress IL6 signalling and inflammatory gene expression in VECs.

The deubiquitination of the PTS1-import receptor Pex5p is required for peroxisomal matrix protein import,

Abstract: Peroxisomal biogenesis depends on the correct import of matrix proteins into the lumen of the organelle. Most peroxisomal matrix proteins harbor the peroxisomal targeting-type 1 (PTS1), which is recognized by the soluble PTS1-receptor Pex5p in the cytosol. Pex5p ferries the PTS1-proteins to the peroxisomal membrane and releases them into the lumen. Finally, the PTS1-receptor is monoubiquitinated on the conserved cysteine 6 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The monoubiquitinated Pex5p is recognized by the peroxisomal export machinery and is retrotranslocated into the cytosol for further rounds of protein import. However, the functional relevance of deubiquitination has not yet been addressed. In this study, we have analyzed a Pex5p-truncation lacking Cys6 [(Δ6)Pex5p], a construct with a ubiquitin-moiety genetically fused to the truncation [Ub-(Δ6)Pex5p], as well as a construct with a reduced susceptibility to deubiquitination [Ub(G75/76A)-(Δ6)Pex5p]. While the (Δ6)Pex5p-truncation is not functional, the Ub-(Δ6)Pex5p chimeric protein can facilitate matrix protein import. In contrast, the Ub(G75/76A)-(Δ6)Pex5p chimera exhibits a complete PTS1-import defect. The data show for the first time that not only ubiquitination but also deubiquitination rates are tightly regulated and that efficient deubiquitination of Pex5p is essential for peroxisomal biogenesis.
