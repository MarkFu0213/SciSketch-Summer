Abstract: Summary
Human primed embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are known to be converted to cells with several trophoblast properties, but it has remained controversial whether this phenomenon represents the inherent differentiation competence of human primed ESCs to trophoblast lineages. In this study, we report that chemical blockage of ACTIVIN/NODAL and FGF signals is sufficient to steer human primed ESCs into GATA3-expressing cells that give rise to placental hormone-producing syncytia analogous to syncytiotrophoblasts of the post-implantation stage of the human embryo. Despite their cytological similarity to syncytiotrophoblasts, these syncytia arise from the non-trophoblastic differentiation trajectory that recapitulates amniogenesis. These results provide insights into the possible extraembryonic differentiation pathway that is unique in primate embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
This study underlines the importance of treadmill exercise in reducing α-synuclein (α-syn) spreading in the A53T brain and protecting nigral dopaminergic neurons. Preformed α-syn fibril (PFF) seeding in the internal capsule of young A53T α-syn mice leads to increased spreading of α-syn to substantia nigra and motor cortex and concomitant loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. However, regular treadmill exercise decreases α-syn spreading in the brain and protects nigral dopaminergic neurons in PFF-seeded mice. Accordingly, treadmill exercise also mitigates α-synucleinopathy in aged A53T mice. While investigating this mechanism, we have observed that treadmill exercise induces the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) in the brain to stimulate lysosomal biogenesis via TFEB. Accordingly, treadmill exercise remains unable to stimulate TFEB and reduce α-synucleinopathy in A53T mice lacking PPARα, and fenofibrate, a prototype PPARα agonist, reduces α-synucleinopathy. These results delineate a beneficial function of treadmill exercise in reducing α-syn spreading in the brain via PPARα.

Abstract: Summary
Organoids recapitulate complex 3D organ structures and represent a unique opportunity to probe the principles of self-organization. While we can alter an organoid’s morphology by manipulating the culture conditions, the morphology of an organoid often resembles that of its original organ, suggesting that organoid morphologies are governed by a set of tissue-specific constraints. Here, we establish a framework to identify constraints on an organoid’s morphological features by quantifying them from microscopy images of organoids exposed to a range of perturbations. We apply this framework to Madin-Darby canine kidney cysts and show that they obey a number of constraints taking the form of scaling relationships or caps on certain parameters. For example, we found that the number, but not size, of cells increases with increasing cyst size. We also find that these constraints vary with cyst age and can be altered by varying the culture conditions. We observed similar sets of constraints in intestinal organoids. This quantitative framework for identifying constraints on organoid morphologies may inform future efforts to engineer organoids.

Abstract: Summary
Morbidity and mortality in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are significantly elevated in people of advanced age. To understand the underlying biology of this phenotype, we utilize the golden hamster model to compare how the innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection differed between younger and older animals. We find that while both hamster cohorts showed similar virus kinetics in the lungs, the host response in older animals was dampened, with diminished tissue repair in the respiratory tract post-infection. Characterization of the adaptive immune response also revealed age-related differences, including fewer germinal center B cells in older hamsters, resulting in reduced potency of neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, older animals demonstrate elevated suppressor T cells and neutrophils in the respiratory tract, correlating with an increase in TGF-β and IL-17 induction. Together, these data support that diminished immunity is one of the underlying causes of age-related morbidity.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining the integrity of the plasma membrane after cellular damage is essential for cell survival. However, it is unclear how cells repair large membrane injuries in vivo. Here, we report that the tetraspanin protein, TSP-15, is recruited to large membrane wounds and forms a ring-like structure in C. elegans epidermis and promotes membrane repair after an injury. TSP-15 recruits from the adjacent region underneath the plasma membrane to the wound site in a RAB-5-dependent manner upon membrane damage. Genetic and live-imaging analysis suggested that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT III) is necessary for recruiting TSP-15 from the early endosome to the damaged membrane. Moreover, TSP-15 interacts with and is required for the accumulation of t-SNARE protein Syntaxin-2, which facilitates membrane repair. These findings provide valuable insights into the role of the conserved tetraspanin TSP-15 in the cellular repair of large wounds resulting from environmental insults.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis is essential for plants to manage responses under environmental stress. Plant immune activation requires the ER, but how ER homeostasis is associated with plant immune activation is largely unexplored. Here we find that transcription of an HVA22 family gene, OsHLP1 (HVA22-like protein 1), is induced by Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Overexpression of OsHLP1 significantly enhances blast disease resistance but impairs ER morphology in rice (Oryza sativa), resulting in enhanced sensitivity to ER stress. OsHLP1 interacts with the NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) transcription factor OsNTL6 at the ER. OsNTL6 localizes to the ER and is relocated to the nucleus after cleavage of the transmembrane domain. OsHLP1 suppresses OsNTL6 protein accumulation, whereas OsNTL6 counteracts OsHLP1 by alleviating sensitivity to ER stress and decreasing disease resistance in OsHLP1 overexpression plants. These findings unravel a mechanism whereby OsHLP1 promotes disease resistance by compromising ER homeostasis when plants are infected by pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
The tolerance of amino acid starvation is fundamental to robust cellular fitness. Asparagine depletion is lethal to some cancer cells, a vulnerability that can be exploited clinically. We report that resistance to asparagine starvation is uniquely dependent on an N-terminal low-complexity domain of GSK3α, which its paralog GSK3β lacks. In response to depletion of specific amino acids, including asparagine, leucine, and valine, this domain mediates supramolecular assembly of GSK3α with ubiquitin-proteasome system components in spatially sequestered cytoplasmic bodies. This effect is independent of mTORC1 or GCN2. In normal cells, GSK3α promotes survival during essential amino acid starvation. In human leukemia, GSK3α body formation predicts asparaginase resistance, and sensitivity to asparaginase combined with a GSK3α inhibitor. We propose that GSK3α body formation provides a cellular mechanism to maximize the catalytic efficiency of proteasomal protein degradation in response to amino acid starvation, an adaptive response co-opted by cancer cells for asparaginase resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac injury leads to the loss of cardiomyocytes, which are rapidly replaced by the proliferation of the surviving cells in zebrafish, but not in mammals. In both the regenerative zebrafish and non-regenerative mammals, cardiac injury induces a sustained macrophage response. Macrophages are required for cardiomyocyte proliferation during zebrafish cardiac regeneration, but the mechanisms whereby macrophages facilitate this crucial process are fundamentally unknown. Using heartbeat-synchronized live imaging, RNA sequencing, and macrophage-null genotypes in the larval zebrafish cardiac injury model, we characterize macrophage function and reveal that these cells activate the epicardium, inducing cardiomyocyte proliferation. Mechanistically, macrophages are specifically recruited to the epicardial-myocardial niche, triggering the expansion of the epicardium, which upregulates vegfaa expression to induce cardiomyocyte proliferation. Our data suggest that epicardial Vegfaa augments a developmental cardiac growth pathway via increased endocardial notch signaling. The identification of this macrophage-dependent mechanism of cardiac regeneration highlights immunomodulation as a potential strategy for enhancing mammalian cardiac repair.

Abstract: Summary
Despite a long appreciation for the role of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in destroying faulty, disease-causing mRNAs and maintaining normal, physiologic mRNA abundance, additional effectors that regulate NMD activity in mammalian cells continue to be identified. Here, we describe a haploid-cell genetic screen for NMD effectors that has unexpectedly identified 13 proteins constituting the AKT signaling pathway. We show that AKT supersedes UPF2 in exon-junction complexes (EJCs) that are devoid of RNPS1 but contain CASC3, defining an unanticipated insulin-stimulated EJC. Without altering UPF1 RNA binding or ATPase activity, AKT-mediated phosphorylation of the UPF1 CH domain at T151 augments UPF1 helicase activity, which is critical for NMD and also decreases the dependence of helicase activity on ATP. We demonstrate that upregulation of AKT signaling contributes to the hyperactivation of NMD that typifies Fragile X syndrome, as exemplified using FMR1-KO neural stem cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) chaperone machinery is involved in the stability and activity of its client proteins. The chaperone function of Hsp90 is regulated by co-chaperones and post-translational modifications. Although structural evidence exists for Hsp90 interaction with clients, our understanding of the impact of Hsp90 chaperone function toward client activity in cells remains elusive. Here, we dissect the impact of recently identified higher eukaryotic co-chaperones, FNIP1/2 (FNIPs) and Tsc1, toward Hsp90 client activity. Our data show that Tsc1 and FNIP2 form mutually exclusive complexes with FNIP1, and that unlike Tsc1, FNIP1/2 interact with the catalytic residue of Hsp90. Functionally, these co-chaperone complexes increase the affinity of the steroid hormone receptors glucocorticoid receptor and estrogen receptor to their ligands in vivo. We provide a model for the responsiveness of the steroid hormone receptor activation upon ligand binding as a consequence of their association with specific Hsp90:co-chaperone subpopulations.

Abstract: Summary
The cerebrovasculature and its mural cells must meet brain regional energy demands, but how their spatial relationship with different neuronal cell types varies across the brain remains largely unknown. Here we apply brain-wide mapping methods to comprehensively define the quantitative relationships between the cerebrovasculature, capillary pericytes, and glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, including neuronal nitric oxide synthase-positive (nNOS+) neurons and their subtypes in adult mice. Our results show high densities of vasculature with high fluid conductance and capillary pericytes in primary motor sensory cortices compared with association cortices that show significant positive and negative correlations with energy-demanding parvalbumin+ and vasomotor nNOS+ neurons, respectively. Thalamo-striatal areas that are connected to primary motor sensory cortices also show high densities of vasculature and pericytes, suggesting dense energy support for motor sensory processing areas. Our cellular-resolution resource offers opportunities to examine spatial relationships between the cerebrovascular network and neuronal cell composition in largely understudied subcortical areas.

Abstract: Summary
The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1–4) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses of humans. Several live-attenuated tetravalent DENV vaccines are at different stages of clinical development and approval. In children with no baseline immunity to DENVs, a leading vaccine (Dengvaxia) is efficacious against vaccine-matched DENV4 genotype II (GII) strains but not vaccine-mismatched DENV4 GI viruses. We use a panel of recombinant DENV4 viruses displaying GI or GII envelope (E) proteins to map Dengvaxia-induced neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) linked to protection. The vaccine stimulated antibodies that neutralize the DENV4 GII virus better than the GI virus. The neutralization differences map to 5 variable amino acids on the E protein located within a region targeted by DENV4 NAbs, supporting a mechanistic role for these epitope-specific NAbs in protection. In children with no baseline immunity to DENVs, levels of DENV4 serotype- and genotype-specific NAbs induced by vaccination are predictive of vaccine efficacy.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms underlying tumor-promoting inflammatory processes in colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) remain largely elusive. Here, we provide genetic evidence for distinct B cell-mediated immunoregulatory mechanisms that protect from chronic colitis versus CAC. We demonstrate an inherent capacity of interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing B cells to differentiate into immunoglobulin A (IgA) plasma cells (PCs) upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation. Our data show that B cell-derived IL-10 is essential to limit pathogenic T helper type 1 (Th1)/Th17 T cell responses during chronic colitis, while IgA PCs derived from IL-10+ B cells are being implicated in restraining tumorigenesis during CAC. Formation of a tumor-protective intestinal environment was associated with clonal expansion of specific types of colonic IgA PCs and development of an altered microbiota that attenuated CAC. We thus propose that regulatory B cell-mediated immunomodulation entails temporal release of IL-10, which is superseded by the generation of specific IgA affecting the microbial community, thereby controlling chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis in a distinctive but interrelated manner.

Abstract: Summary
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease, with a prevalence of 25% worldwide. However, the underlying molecular mechanism involved in the development and progression of the NAFLD spectrum remains unclear. Single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A1 (RPA1) participates in DNA replication, recombination, and damage repair. Here, we show that Rpa1+/− mice develop fatty liver disease during aging and in response to a high-fat diet. Liver-specific deletion of Rpa1 results in downregulation of genes related to fatty acid oxidation and impaired fatty acid oxidation, which leads to hepatic steatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Mechanistically, RPA1 binds gene regulatory regions, chromatin-remodeling factors, and HNF4A and remodels chromatin architecture, through which RPA1 promotes HNF4A transcriptional activity and fatty acid β oxidation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that RPA1 is an important regulator of NAFLD through controlling chromatin accessibility.

Abstract: Summary
Development of primordial germ cells (PGCs) is required for reproduction. During PGC development in mammals, major epigenetic remodeling occurs, which is hypothesized to establish an epigenetic landscape for sex-specific germ cell differentiation and gametogenesis. In order to address the role of embryonic ectoderm development (EED) and histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in this process, we created an EED conditional knockout mouse and show that EED is essential for regulating the timing of sex-specific PGC differentiation in both ovaries and testes, as well as X chromosome dosage decompensation in testes. Integrating chromatin and whole genome bisulfite sequencing of epiblast and PGCs, we identified a poised repressive signature of H3K27me3/DNA methylation that we propose is established in the epiblast where EED and DNMT1 interact. Thus, EED joins DNMT1 in regulating the timing of sex-specific PGC differentiation during the critical window when the gonadal niche cells specialize into an ovary or testis.

Abstract: Summary
Image- and non-image-forming vision are essential for animal behavior. Here we use genetically modified mouse lines to examine retinal circuits driving image- and non-image-functions. We describe the outer retinal circuits underlying the pupillary light response (PLR) and circadian photoentrainment, two non-image-forming behaviors. Rods and cones signal light increments and decrements through the ON and OFF pathways, respectively. We find that the OFF pathway drives image-forming vision but cannot drive circadian photoentrainment or the PLR. Cone light responses drive image formation but fail to drive the PLR. At photopic levels, rods use the primary and secondary rod pathways to drive the PLR, whereas at the scotopic and mesopic levels, rods use the primary pathway to drive the PLR, and the secondary pathway is insufficient. Circuit dynamics allow rod ON pathways to drive two non-image-forming behaviors across a wide range of light intensities, whereas the OFF pathway is potentially restricted to image formation.

Abstract: Summary
We previously showed that the Arf1-mediated lipolysis pathway sustains stem cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs); its ablation resulted in necrosis of stem cells and CSCs, which further triggers a systemic antitumor immune response. Here we show that knocking down Arf1 in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) causes metabolic stress, which promotes the expression and translocation of ISC-produced damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs; Pretaporter [Prtp] and calreticulin [Calr]). DAMPs regulate macroglobulin complement-related (Mcr) expression and secretion. The secreted Mcr influences the expression and localization of enterocyte (EC)-produced Draper (Drpr) and LRP1 receptors (pattern recognition receptors [PRRs]) to activate autophagy in ECs for ATP production. The secreted ATP possibly feeds back to kill ISCs by activating inflammasome-like pyroptosis. We identify an evolutionarily conserved pathway that sustains stem cells and CSCs, and its ablation results in an immunogenic cascade that promotes death of stem cells and CSCs as well as antitumor immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial cell organization and the mechanical stability of tissues are closely related. In this context, it has been recently shown that packing optimization in bended or folded epithelia is achieved by an energy minimization mechanism that leads to a complex cellular shape: the “scutoid”. Here, we focus on the relationship between this shape and the connectivity between cells. We use a combination of computational, experimental, and biophysical approaches to examine how energy drivers affect the three-dimensional (3D) packing of tubular epithelia. We propose an energy-based stochastic model that explains the 3D cellular connectivity. Then, we challenge it by experimentally reducing the cell adhesion. As a result, we observed an increment in the appearance of scutoids that correlated with a decrease in the energy barrier necessary to connect with new cells. We conclude that tubular epithelia satisfy a quantitative biophysical principle that links tissue geometry and energetics with the average cellular connectivity.

Abstract: Summary
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is diagnosed three to four times more frequently in males than in females. Genetic studies of rare variants support a female protective effect (FPE) against ASD. However, sex differences in common inherited genetic risk for ASD are less studied, particularly within families. Leveraging the Danish iPSYCH resource, we found siblings of female ASD cases (n = 1,707) had higher rates of ASD than siblings of male ASD cases (n = 6,270; p < 1.0 × 10−10). In the Simons Simplex and SPARK collections, mothers of ASD cases (n = 7,436) carried more polygenic risk for ASD than fathers of ASD cases (n = 5,926; 0.08 polygenic risk score [PRS] SD; p = 7.0 × 10−7). Further, male unaffected siblings under-inherited polygenic risk (n = 1,519; p = 0.03). Using both epidemiologic and genetic approaches, our findings strongly support an FPE against ASD’s common inherited influences.

Abstract: Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) is a new gene therapy method that uses ultrasound and microbubbles carrying target genes to achieve gene transfection. However, whether UTMD-mediated ANLN silencing transfection helps to restrain the growth of cervical cancer (CC) is obscure. ANLN level in tumor tissues, adjacent tissues, and cells was tested using the database, qRT-PCR, and western blot. The optimal concentration of SF6 was determined by MTT assay. Mechanical index (MI) was selected by flow cytometry. After transfection with liposome or UTMD-mediated liposome, cell function experiments, qRT-PCR, and western blot were employed to assess CC cell biological behaviors and EZH2 level. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related marker and apoptosis-related marker expressions were examined utilizing qRT-PCR and western blot. 10% SF6 and MI of 0.28 were selected for subsequent tests. ANLN was highly expressed in CC and cells. The transfection efficiency of the UTMD-siANLN group was higher than that of the L-siANLN group. Moreover, the repression of UTMD-siANLN on CC cell malignant phenotypes was stronger than L-siANLN. UTMD-siANLN attenuated EZH2 expression in CC cells. The modulatory role of UTMD-siANLN on EMT- and apoptosis-related markers was reversed by EZH2 overexpression. UTMD can improve the efficiency of siANLN transfection into CC cells to induce suppression of CC cell malignant phenotypes, which may become a new target of gene therapy for CC.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle regeneration relies on satellite cells that can proliferate, differentiate, and form new myofibers upon injury. Emerging evidence suggests that misregulation of satellite cell fate and function influences the severity of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The transcription factor Pax7 determines the myogenic identity and maintenance of the pool of satellite cells. The circadian clock regulates satellite cell proliferation and self-renewal. Here, we show that the CLOCK-interacting protein Circadian (CIPC) a negative-feedback regulator of the circadian clock, is up-regulated during myoblast differentiation. Specific deletion of Cipc in satellite cells alleviates myopathy, improves muscle function, and reduces fibrosis in mdx mice. Cipc deficiency leads to activation of the ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 signaling pathways, which activates the transcription factor SP1 to trigger the transcription of Pax7 and MyoD. Therefore, CIPC is a negative regulator of satellite cell function, and loss of Cipc in satellite cells promotes muscle regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
The liver is one of the most-favored distant metastatic sites for solid tumors, and interactions between cancer cells and components of the hepatic microenvironment are essential for liver metastasis (LM). Although sex is one of the determinants for primary liver cancer, sexual dimorphism in LM (SDLM) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We herein demonstrate a significant male-biased SDLM, which is attributed to host androgen/androgen receptor (Ar) signaling that promotes hepatic seeding of tumor cells and subsequent outgrowth in a neutrophil-dependent manner. Mechanistically, androgen/Ar signaling promotes hepatic accumulation of neutrophils by promoting proliferation and development of neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow, as well as modulating hepatic recruitment of neutrophils and their functions. Antagonizing the androgen/Ar/neutrophil axis significantly mitigates LM in males. Our data thus reveal an important role of androgen in LM and suggest that androgen/Ar modulation represents a promising target for LM therapy in men.

Abstract: Summary
How mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key regulator of cellular metabolism, affects dendritic cell (DC) metabolism and T cell-priming capacity has primarily been investigated in vitro, but how mTORC1 regulates this in vivo remains poorly defined. Here, using mice deficient for mTORC1 component raptor in DCs, we find that loss of mTORC1 negatively affects glycolytic and fatty acid metabolism and maturation of conventional DCs, particularly cDC1s. Nonetheless, antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses to infection are not compromised and are even enhanced following skin immunization. This is associated with increased activation of Langerhans cells and a subpopulation of EpCAM-expressing cDC1s, of which the latter show an increased physical interaction with CD8+ T cells in situ. Together, this work reveals that mTORC1 limits CD8+ T cell priming in vivo by differentially orchestrating the metabolism and immunogenicity of distinct antigen-presenting cell subsets, which may have implications for clinical use of mTOR inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
As an enveloped virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) delivers its viral genome into host cells via fusion of the viral and cell membranes. Here, we show that ANO6/TMEM16F-mediated cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine is critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry and that ANO6-selective inhibitors are effective against SARS-CoV-2 infections. Application of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped virus (SARS2-PsV) evokes a cytosolic Ca2+ elevation and ANO6-dependent phosphatidylserine externalization in ACE2/TMPRSS2-positive mammalian cells. A high-throughput screening of drug-like chemical libraries identifies three different structural classes of chemicals showing ANO6 inhibitory effects. Among them, A6-001 displays the highest potency and ANO6 selectivity and it inhibits the single-round infection of SARS2-PsV in ACE2/TMPRSS2-positive HEK 293T cells. More importantly, A6-001 strongly inhibits authentic SARS-CoV-2-induced phosphatidylserine scrambling and SARS-CoV-2 viral replications in Vero, Calu-3, and primarily cultured human nasal epithelial cells. These results provide mechanistic insights into the viral entry process and offer a potential target for pharmacological intervention to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Abstract: Summary
Characterized by intracellular lipid droplet accumulation, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and is a lethal disease. Through an unbiased siRNA screen of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent enzymes, which play a critical role in tumorigenesis, we identified Jumonji domain-containing 6 (JMJD6) as an essential gene for ccRCC tumor development. The downregulation of JMJD6 abolished ccRCC colony formation in vitro and inhibited orthotopic tumor growth in vivo. Integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses uncovered diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) as a critical JMJD6 effector. Mechanistically, JMJD6 interacted with RBM39 and co-occupied DGAT1 gene promoter with H3K4me3 to induce DGAT1 expression. JMJD6 silencing reduced DGAT1, leading to decreased lipid droplet formation and tumorigenesis. The pharmacological inhibition (or depletion) of DGAT1 inhibited lipid droplet formation in vitro and ccRCC tumorigenesis in vivo. Thus, the JMJD6-DGAT1 axis represents a potential new therapeutic target for ccRCC.

Abstract: Summary
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem tumor-forming disorder caused by loss of TSC1 or TSC2. Renal manifestations predominately include cysts and angiomyolipomas. Despite a well-described monogenic etiology, the cellular pathogenesis remains elusive. We report a genetically engineered human renal organoid model that recapitulates pleiotropic features of TSC kidney disease in vitro and upon orthotopic xenotransplantation. Time course single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrates that loss of TSC1 or TSC2 affects multiple developmental processes in the renal epithelial, stromal, and glial compartments. First, TSC1 or TSC2 ablation induces transitional upregulation of stromal-associated genes. Second, epithelial cells in the TSC1−/− and TSC2−/− organoids exhibit a rapamycin-insensitive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Third, a melanocytic population forms exclusively in TSC1−/− and TSC2−/− organoids, branching from MITF+ Schwann cell precursors. Together, these results illustrate the pleiotropic developmental consequences of biallelic inactivation of TSC1 or TSC2 and offer insight into TSC kidney lesion pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance between progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the construction of the embryonic brain demands the combination of cell lineage and functional approaches. Here, we generate the comprehensive lineage of hindbrain boundary cells by using a CRISPR-based knockin zebrafish transgenic line that specifically labels the boundaries. We unveil that boundary cells asynchronously engage in neurogenesis undergoing a functional transition from neuroepithelial progenitors to radial glia cells, coinciding with the onset of Notch3 signaling that triggers their asymmetrical cell division. Upon notch3 loss of function, boundary cells lose radial glia properties and symmetrically divide undergoing neuronal differentiation. Finally, we show that the fate of boundary cells is to become neurons, the subtype of which relies on their axial position, suggesting that boundary cells contribute to refine the number and proportion of the distinct neuronal populations.

Abstract: Summary
Myoblast fusion is an indispensable process in skeletal muscle development and regeneration. Studies in Drosophila led to the discovery of the asymmetric fusogenic synapse, in which one cell invades its fusion partner with actin-propelled membrane protrusions to promote fusion. However, the timing and sites of vertebrate myoblast fusion remain elusive. Here, we show that fusion between zebrafish fast muscle cells is mediated by an F-actin-enriched invasive structure. Two cell adhesion molecules, Jam2a and Jam3b, are associated with the actin structure, with Jam2a being the major organizer. The Arp2/3 actin nucleation-promoting factors, WAVE and WASP—but not the bipartite fusogenic proteins, Myomaker or Myomixer—promote the formation of the invasive structure. Moreover, the convergence of fusogen-containing microdomains and the invasive protrusions is a prerequisite for cell membrane fusion. Thus, our study provides unprecedented insights into the cellular architecture and molecular determinants of the asymmetric fusogenic synapse in an intact vertebrate animal.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an essential role in the communication between cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the effect of tumor-derived EVs on the growth and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains to be explored. This study aimed to elucidate the role of miR-153-3p-EVs in the invasion and migration capabilities of LUAD cells and explore its mechanism through in vivo and in vitro experiments. We found that miR-153-3p was specifically and highly expressed in LUAD and its secreted EVs. Furthermore, the expression of BANCR was negatively regulated by miR-153-3p and identified as a target gene of miR-153-3p using luciferase reporter assays. Through further investigation, we found that the downregulation of BANCR activates the PI3K/AKT pathway and accelerates the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which ultimately leads to the aggravation of LUAD. The orthotopic xenograft mouse model was established to illustrate the effect of miR-153-3p-EVs on LUAD. Animal studies showed that miR-153-3p-EVs accelerated tumor growth in mice. Besides, we found that miR-153-3p-EVs could damage the respiratory ability of mice and produce a mass of inflammatory cells around the lung tissue of mice. Nevertheless, antagomir-153-3p treatment could inhibit the deterioration of respiratory function and inhibit the growth of lung tumors in mice. In conclusion, our study reveals the potential molecular mechanism of miR-153-3p-EVs in the development of LUAD and provides a potential strategy for the treatment of LUAD.

Abstract: The post-translational modification (e.g., phosphorylation) of estrogen receptor α (ERα) plays a role in controlling the expression and subcellular localization of ERα as well as its sensitivity to hormone response. Here, we show that ERα is also modified by UFM1 and this modification (ufmylation) plays a crucial role in promoting the stability and transactivity of ERα, which in turn promotes breast cancer development. The elevation of ufmylation via the knockdown of UFSP2 (the UFM1-deconjugating enzyme in humans) dramatically increases ERα stability by inhibiting ubiquitination. In contrast, ERα stability is decreased by the prevention of ufmylation via the silencing of UBA5 (the UFM1-activating E1 enzyme). Lys171 and Lys180 of ERα were identified as the major UFM1 acceptor sites, and the replacement of both Lys residues by Arg (2KR mutation) markedly reduced ERα stability. Moreover, the 2KR mutation abrogated the 17β-estradiol-induced transactivity of ERα and the expression of its downstream target genes, including pS2, cyclin D1, and c-Myc; this indicates that ERα ufmylation is required for its transactivation function. In addition, the 2KR mutation prevented anchorage-independent colony formation by MCF7 cells. Most notably, the expression of UFM1 and its conjugating machinery (i.e., UBA5, UFC1, UFL1, and UFBP1) were dramatically upregulated in ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines and tissues. Collectively, these findings implicate a critical role attributed to ERα ufmylation in breast cancer development by ameliorating its stability and transactivity.

Abstract: Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 1 like (MTHFD1L) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate (THF). This study aimed to investigate the effect of MTHFD1L in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Tumor tissues and adjacent tissues from 11 patients with PTC were collected, the expression level of MTHFD1L mRNA was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database was used for analysis MTHFD1L differentially expressed between tumor tissue and adjacent tissues. MTHFD1L was knocked down by a lentivirus-based system and CRISPR-Cas9. Affymetrix genechip human transcriptome array 2.0 was used to assess gene expression. Cell growth and motility were evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were investigated by flow cytometry assay. The expression levels of proteins were detected by western blotting. MTHFD1L mRNA and protein expression levels significantly increased in tumor tissues and CAL-62, K1 and TPC-1 cell lines. After knockdown MTHFD1L, the growth of cells were reduced while cell apoptosis was increased. In addition, tumor growth was inhibited after MTHFD1L knockdown in nude mice. Affymetrix genechip human transcriptome array 2.0 was founded that MTHFD1L knockdown can inhibit the expression levels of CCND1 and Notch2. Furthermore, we identified that MTHFD1L knockdown inhibited cells growth and induced cell apoptosis in PTC. Importantly, MTHFD1L knockdown decreased the expression levels of Notch2, Hes1 CCND1, Bcl-2, and PCNA protein, whereas the level of Bax increased. Our study suggested MTHFD1L knockdown could diminished PTC cell proliferation. MTHFD1L serves as a valuable therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Within the central nervous system, Wnt7a/b are unambiguously discriminated from other Wnt ligands by an endothelial receptor complex made of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored Reck and the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr124. Reck is a Wnt7a/b-specific receptor, while Gpr124 facilitates the delivery of Reck-bound Wnt7a/b ligands to Frizzled, through partially characterized mechanisms. We report that, in zebrafish, the Gpr124-Frizzled interactions are dominated by intracellular scaffolds that exploit the striking molecular mimicry between Gpr124 and Frizzled intracellular domains (ICDs): an internal Dvl-binding motif and a C-terminal ETTV motif that recruits Dlg4 and Magi3. By contrast, mammalian Gpr124 receptors exhibit an ICD-independent interaction mechanism governed by species-specific attributes of their transmembrane and extracellular domains. This mechanism seemingly evolved to replace the Dvl-mediated mechanism. By contrasting zebrafish, mouse, and human Gpr124, this study provides insights into the evolution of Gpr124/Reck function across the vertebrate clade, a receptor complex uniquely implicated in Wnt ligand-specific cellular responses.

Abstract: Summary
Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (TDP1) hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond between a DNA 3′ end and a tyrosyl moiety and is implicated in the repair of trapped topoisomerase I (Top1)-DNA covalent complexes (Top1cc). Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) catalyzes arginine methylation of TDP1 at the residues R361 and R586. Here, we establish mechanistic crosstalk between TDP1 arginine methylation and ubiquitylation, which is critical for TDP1 homeostasis and cellular responses to Top1 poisons. We show that R586 methylation promotes TDP1 ubiquitylation, which facilitates ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent TDP1 turnover by impeding the binding of UCHL3 (deubiquitylase enzyme) with TDP1. TDP1-R586 also promotes TDP1-XRCC1 binding and XRCC1 foci formation at Top1cc-damage sites. Intriguingly, R361 methylation enhances the 3′-phosphodiesterase activity of TDP1 in real-time fluorescence-based cleavage assays, and this was rationalized using structural modeling. Together, our findings establish arginine methylation as a co-regulator of TDP1 proteostasis and activity, which modulates the repair of trapped Top1cc.

Abstract: Summary
MacroH2A histone variants have a function in gene regulation that is poorly understood at the molecular level. We report that macroH2A1.2 and macroH2A2 modulate the transcriptional ground state of cancer cells and how they respond to inflammatory cytokines. Removal of macroH2A1.2 and macroH2A2 in hepatoblastoma cells affects the contact frequency of promoters and distal enhancers coinciding with changes in enhancer activity or preceding them in response to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha. Although macroH2As regulate genes in both directions, they globally facilitate the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-mediated response. In contrast, macroH2As suppress the response to the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma. MacroH2A2 has a stronger contribution to gene repression than macroH2A1.2. Taken together, our results suggest that macroH2As have a role in regulating the response of cancer cells to inflammatory signals on the level of chromatin structure. This is likely relevant for the interaction of cancer cells with immune cells of their microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Combinations of ataxia telangiectasia- and Rad3-related kinase inhibitors (ATRis) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) synergistically kill tumor cells through modulation of complementary DNA repair pathways, but their tolerability is limited by hematological toxicities. To address this, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to identify genetic alterations that hypersensitize cells to a combination of the ATRi RP-3500 with PARPi, including deficiency in RNase H2, RAD51 paralog mutations, or the “alternative lengthening of telomeres” telomere maintenance mechanism. We show that RP-3500 and PARPi combinations kill cells carrying these genetic alterations at doses sub-therapeutic as single agents. We also demonstrate the mechanism of combination hypersensitivity in RNase H2-deficient cells, where we observe an irreversible replication catastrophe, allowing us to design a highly efficacious and tolerable in vivo dosing schedule. We present a comprehensive dataset to inform development of ATRi and PARPi combinations and an experimental framework applicable to other drug combination strategies.

Abstract: Background and aim
Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are a promising cell source for novel tissue engineering approaches to breast reconstruction following cancer resection. However there is limited knowledge on the effect of adjuvant therapies such as hormonal therapy on ASCs, which may affect their efficacy in regenerative strategies. The present study aims to investigate the effects of Tamoxifen and its metabolites Afimoxifene (4-Hydroxy-Tamoxifen) and Endoxifen (N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen) on patient-derived ASC viability, apoptosis, adipogenic differentiation and angiogenic potential.
Methods
ASCs were isolated from fat harvested from female breast cancer patients undergoing breast reconstruction surgery or cosmetic procedures. Oestrogen receptor (ER α, β) expression was analysed using immunofluorescence. ASCs were then treated with various concentrations of Afimoxifene, Endoxifen and Tamoxifen (combination), and the impact on ASC viability and apoptosis determined. ASCs were cultured in adipogenic-differentiation media with or without tamoxifen and derivatives, and adipogenesis was measured using quantitative Real-time Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and histological staining (Oil Red O). The effect on secreted VEGF levels was also quantified in ASC conditioned media
Results
ASCs were successfully isolated and characterised from human abdominal lipoaspirates or fat tissues (n = 8). ASCs subjected to varying doses of Tamoxifen and metabolites (up to 1000 nM) showed no decline in cell viability or increase in apoptosis, at physiological doses (upto 100 nM). Functional decline in adipogenic differentiation or gene expression was observed at supraphysiological concentrations of Tamoxifen (1000 nM). VEGF165 protein secretion in ASC-cell conditioned media was not significantly impacted irrespective of dosage.
Conclusion
At physiologically relevant doses, Tamoxifen treatment did not result in any deleterious effect on ASC survival and functionality and is unlikely to negatively impact ASC based breast reconstruction strategies for breast cancer patients receiving this adjuvant hormonal therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian skull vault is essential to shape the head and protect the brain, but the cellular and molecular events underlying its development remain incompletely understood. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling from early to late mouse embryonic stages provides a detailed atlas of cranial lineages. It distinguishes various populations of progenitors and reveals a high expression of SOXC genes (encoding the SOX4, SOX11, and SOX12 transcription factors) early in development in actively proliferating and myofibroblast-like osteodermal progenitors. SOXC inactivation in these cells causes severe skull and skin underdevelopment due to the limited expansion of cell populations before and upon lineage commitment. SOXC genes enhance the expression of gene signatures conferring dynamic cellular and molecular properties, including actin cytoskeleton assembly, chromatin remodeling, and signaling pathway induction and responsiveness. These findings shed light onto craniogenic mechanisms and SOXC functions and suggest that similar mechanisms could decisively control many developmental, adult, pathological, and regenerative processes.

Abstract: Summary
TET1 maintains hypomethylation at bivalent promoters through its catalytic activity in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, TET1 catalytic activity-independent function in regulating bivalent genes is not well understood. Using a proteomics approach, we map the TET1 interactome in ESCs and identify PSPC1 as a TET1 partner. Genome-wide location analysis reveals that PSPC1 functionally associates with TET1 and Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2). We establish that PSPC1 and TET1 repress, and the lncRNA Neat1 activates, bivalent gene expression. In ESCs, Neat1 is preferentially bound to PSPC1 alongside its PRC2 association at bivalent promoters. During the ESC-to-epiblast-like stem cell (EpiLC) transition, PSPC1 and TET1 maintain PRC2 chromatin occupancy at bivalent gene promoters, while Neat1 facilitates the activation of certain bivalent genes by promoting PRC2 binding to their mRNAs. Our study demonstrates a TET1-PSPC1-Neat1 molecular axis that modulates PRC2-binding affinity to chromatin and bivalent gene transcripts in controlling stem cell bivalency.

Abstract: Summary
Coenzyme A (CoA) is essential for metabolism and protein acetylation. Current knowledge holds that each cell obtains CoA exclusively through biosynthesis via the canonical five-step pathway, starting with pantothenate uptake. However, recent studies have suggested the presence of additional CoA-generating mechanisms, indicating a more complex system for CoA homeostasis. Here, we uncovered pathways for CoA generation through inter-organismal flows of CoA precursors. Using traceable compounds and fruit flies with a genetic block in CoA biosynthesis, we demonstrate that progeny survive embryonal and early larval development by obtaining CoA precursors from maternal sources. Later in life, the microbiome can provide the essential CoA building blocks to the host, enabling continuation of normal development. A flow of stable, long-lasting CoA precursors between living organisms is revealed. This indicates the presence of complex strategies to maintain CoA homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Many cell regulatory systems implicate nonlinearity and redundancy among components. The regulatory network governing lamellipodial and lamellar actin structures is prototypical of such a system, containing tens of actin-nucleating and -modulating molecules with functional overlap and feedback loops. Due to instantaneous and long-term compensation, phenotyping the system response to perturbation provides limited information on the roles the targeted component plays in the unperturbed system. Accordingly, how individual actin regulators contribute to lamellipodial dynamics remains ambiguous. Here, we present a perturbation-free reconstruction of cause-effect relations among actin regulators by applying Granger-causal inference to constitutive image fluctuations that indicate regulator recruitment as a proxy for activity. Our analysis identifies distinct zones of actin regulator activation and of causal effects on filament assembly and delineates actin-dependent and actin-independent regulator roles in controlling edge motion. We propose that edge motion is driven by assembly of two independently operating actin filament systems.

Abstract: Summary
dsRNA sensing triggers antiviral responses against RNA and DNA viruses in diverse eukaryotes. In Drosophila, Invertebrate iridescent virus 6 (IIV-6), a large DNA virus, triggers production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the dsRNA sensor Dicer-2. Here, we show that host RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) bidirectionally transcribes specific AT-rich regions of the IIV-6 DNA genome to generate dsRNA. Both replicative and naked IIV-6 genomes trigger production of dsRNA in Drosophila cells, implying direct sensing of invading DNA. Loquacious-PD, a Dicer-2 co-factor essential for the biogenesis of endogenous siRNAs, is dispensable for processing of IIV-6-derived dsRNAs, which suggests that they are distinct. Consistent with this finding, inhibition of the RNAPII co-factor P-TEFb affects the synthesis of endogenous, but not virus-derived, dsRNA. Altogether, our results suggest that a non-canonical RNAPII complex recognizes invading viral DNA to synthesize virus-derived dsRNA, which activates the antiviral siRNA pathway in Drosophila.

Abstract: Summary
Homeostatic thermogenesis is an essential protective feature of endotherms. However, the specific neuronal types involved in cold-induced thermogenesis remain largely unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and in situ hybridization, we screened for cold-sensitive neurons and found preprodynorphin (PDYN)-expressing cells in the dorsal medial region of the ventromedial hypothalamus (dmVMH) to be a candidate. Subsequent in vivo calcium recording showed that cold temperature activates dmVMHPdyn neurons, whereas hot temperature suppresses them. In addition, optogenetic activation of dmVMHPdyn neurons increases the brown adipose tissue and core body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, whereas optogenetic inhibition shows opposite effects, supporting their role in homeostatic thermogenesis. Furthermore, we found that dmVMHPdyn neurons are linked to known thermoregulatory circuits. Importantly, dmVMHPdyn neurons also show activation during mouse social interaction, and optogenetic inhibition suppresses social interaction and associated hyperthermia. Together, our study describes dual functions of dmVMHPdyn neurons that allow coordinated regulation of body temperature and social behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
We analyze transposable elements (TEs) in glioblastoma (GBM) patients using a proteogenomic pipeline that combines single-cell transcriptomics, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) samples from tumors and healthy-tissue cohorts, and immunopeptidomic samples. We thus identify 370 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I-bound peptides encoded by TEs differentially expressed in GBM. Some of the peptides are encoded by repeat sequences from intact open reading frames (ORFs) present in up to several hundred TEs from recent long interspersed nuclear element (LINE)-1, long terminal repeat (LTR), and SVA subfamilies. Other HLA-I-bound peptides are encoded by single copies of TEs from old subfamilies that are expressed recurrently in GBM tumors and not expressed, or very infrequently and at low levels, in healthy tissues (including brain). These peptide-coding, GBM-specific, highly recurrent TEs represent potential tumor-specific targets for cancer immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
TDP-43 mediates proper Stathmin-2 (STMN2) mRNA splicing, and STMN2 protein is reduced in the spinal cord of most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To test the hypothesis that STMN2 loss contributes to ALS pathogenesis, we generated constitutive and conditional STMN2 knockout mice. Constitutive STMN2 loss results in early-onset sensory and motor neuropathy featuring impaired motor behavior and dramatic distal neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation of fast-fatigable motor units, which are selectively vulnerable in ALS, without axon or motoneuron degeneration. Selective excision of STMN2 in motoneurons leads to similar NMJ pathology. STMN2 knockout heterozygous mice, which better model the partial loss of STMN2 protein found in patients with ALS, display a slowly progressive, motor-selective neuropathy with functional deficits and NMJ denervation. Thus, our findings strongly support the hypothesis that STMN2 reduction owing to TDP-43 pathology contributes to ALS pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The perinuclear theca (PT) is a cytoskeletal element encapsulating the sperm nucleus; however, our understanding of the physiological roles of PT in sperm is very limited. We show that Calicin interacts with itself and many other PT components, indicating it may serve as an organizing center of the PT assembly. Calicin is detectable first when surrounding the acrosome, then detected around the entire nucleus, and finally translocated to the postacrosomal region of spermatid heads. Intriguingly, loss of Calicin specifically causes surface subsidence of sperm heads in the nuclear condensation stage. Calicin interacts with inner acrosomal membrane (IAM) protein Spaca1 and nuclear envelope (NE) components to form an “IAM-PT-NE” structure. Intriguingly, Ccin-knockout sperm also exhibit DNA damage and failure of fertilization. Our study provides solid animal evidence to suggest that the PT encapsulating sperm nucleus helps shape the sperm head and maintain the nuclear structure.

Abstract: Summary
The rise and fall of estrogen and progesterone across menstrual cycles and during pregnancy regulates breast development and modifies cancer risk. How these hormones impact each cell type in the breast remains poorly understood because they act indirectly through paracrine networks. Using single-cell analysis of premenopausal breast tissue, we reveal a network of coordinated transcriptional programs representing the tissue-level response to changing hormone levels. Our computational approach, DECIPHER-seq, leverages person-to-person variability in breast composition and cell state to uncover programs that co-vary across individuals. We use differences in cell-type proportions to infer a subset of programs that arise from direct cell-cell interactions regulated by hormones. Further, we demonstrate that prior pregnancy and obesity modify hormone responsiveness through distinct mechanisms: obesity reduces the proportion of hormone-responsive cells, whereas pregnancy dampens the direct response of these cells to hormones. Together, these results provide a comprehensive map of the cycling human breast.

Abstract: Summary
We have previously described polyglutamine-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) as an adapter required for the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-mediated innate response to the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and other lentiviruses. Cytoplasmic HIV-1 DNA is a transient and low-abundance pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP), and the mechanism for its detection and verification is not fully understood. Here, we show a two-factor authentication strategy by the innate surveillance machinery to selectively respond to the low concentration of HIV-1 DNA, while distinguishing these species from extranuclear DNA molecules. We find that, upon HIV-1 infection, PQBP1 decorates the intact viral capsid, and this serves as a primary verification step for the viral nucleic acid cargo. As reverse transcription and capsid disassembly initiate, cGAS is recruited to the capsid in a PQBP1-dependent manner. This positions cGAS at the site of PAMP generation and sanctions its response to a low-abundance DNA PAMP.

Abstract: Summary
Active inflammation generally promotes immune activation. However, in the tumor microenvironment (TME), active inflammation occurs in parallel with immunosuppression, and both contribute to tumor growth. Why inflammation does not lead to immune activation in TME remains unclear. In this study, using the immune checkpoint inhibitor-insensitive mouse cancer model and single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that PGE2-EP2/EP4 signaling simultaneously promotes active inflammation by inducing expression of the NF-κB genes in myeloid cells and elicits immunosuppression by driving the mregDC (mature DC enriched in immunoregulatory molecules)-Treg (regulatory T cell) axis for Treg recruitment and activation in the tumor. Importantly, the EP2/EP4 expression level is strongly correlated with the gene signatures of both active inflammation and the mregDC-Treg axis and has significant prognosis value in various human cancers. Thus, PGE2-EP2/EP4 signaling functions as the key regulatory node linking active inflammation and immunosuppression in TME, which can be targeted by EP2 and EP4 antagonists for cancer therapeutics.

Abstract: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been implicated in pathological conditions including chronic pain. Activation of astrocytic TLRs leads to the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (TNF-α), which can cause pathological inflammation and tissue damage in the central nervous system. However, the mechanisms of TLR4-mediated cytokine releases from astrocytes are incomplete understood. Our previous study has shown that Orai1, a key component of calcium release activated calcium channels (CRACs), mediates Ca2+ entry in astrocytes. How Orai1 contributes to TLR4 signaling remains unclear. Here we show that Orai1 deficiency drastically attenuated lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced TNF-α and IL-6 production in astrocytes. Acute LPS treatment did not induce Ca2+ response and had no effect on thapsigargin (Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor)-induced store-dependent Ca2+ entry. Inhibition or knockdown of Orai1 showed no reduction in LPS-induced p-ERK1/2, p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or p-p38 MAPK activation. Interestingly, Orai1 protein level was significantly increased after LPS exposure, which was blocked by inhibition of NF-κB activity. LPS significantly increased basal Ca2+ level and SOCE after exposure to astrocytes. Moreover, elevating extracellular Ca2+ concentration increased cytosolic Ca2+ level, which was almost eliminated in Orai1 KO astrocytes. Our study reports novel findings that Orai1 acts as a Ca2+ leak channel regulating the basal Ca2+ level and enhancing cytokine production in astrocytes under the inflammatory condition. These findings highlight an important role of Orai1 in astrocytic TRL4 function and may suggest that Orai1 could be a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory disorders including chronic pain.

Abstract: Summary
Base editors (BEs) are a group of genetic tools with potential in both scientific and medical research. Recently, a glycosylase BE (GBE), which converts C to G, has been constructed. However, the editing efficiency and targeting scope remains to be further exploited. Here, we renovate the GBE by first fusing it to various transactivation modules including Vp64, leading to a higher conversion of C to G relative to GBE in HEK293T cells. Further, higher editing efficiency, enhanced editing purity, and an enlarged editing window are acquired by the combination of SunTag system, GBE, and VP64. Finally, a SpRY-Cas9 variant is used to expand the targeting scope for Vp64-GBE. Vp64-SpRY-GBE and SpRY-GBE target genomic sites with non-NGG PAM, and Vp64-SpRY-GBE demonstrates better performance compared with SpRY-GBE. The construction of GBE variants with superior performance and versatile editing scope broadens the toolbox of BEs and may contribute to genetic therapies with C-to-G mutation.

Abstract: Summary
Glycogen is the primary energy reserve in mammals, and dysregulation of glycogen metabolism can result in glycogen storage diseases (GSDs). In muscle, glycogen synthesis is initiated by the enzymes glycogenin-1 (GYG1), which seeds the molecule by autoglucosylation, and glycogen synthase-1 (GYS1), which extends the glycogen chain. Although both enzymes are required for proper glycogen production, the nature of their interaction has been enigmatic. Here, we present the human GYS1:GYG1 complex in multiple conformations representing different functional states. We observe an asymmetric conformation of GYS1 that exposes an interface for close GYG1 association, and propose this state facilitates handoff of the GYG1-associated glycogen chain to a GYS1 subunit for elongation. Full activation of GYS1 widens the GYG1-binding groove, enabling GYG1 release concomitant with glycogen chain growth. This structural mechanism connecting chain nucleation and extension explains the apparent stepwise nature of glycogen synthesis and suggests distinct states to target for GSD-modifying therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
The foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2C protein shares conserved motifs with enterovirus 2Cs despite low sequence identity. Here, we determine the crystal structure of an FMDV 2C fragment to 1.83 Å resolution, which comprises an ATPase domain, a region equivalent to the enterovirus 2C zinc-finger (ZFER), and a C-terminal domain harboring a loop (PBL) that occupies a hydrophobic cleft (Pocket) in an adjacent 2C molecule. Mutations at ZFER, PBL, and Pocket affect FMDV 2C ATPase activity and are lethal to FMDV infectious clones. Because the PBL-Pocket interaction between FMDV 2C molecules is essential for its functions, we design an anti-FMDV peptide derived from PBL (PBL-peptide). PBL-peptide inhibits FMDV 2C ATPase activity, binds FMDV 2C with nanomolar affinity, and disrupts FMDV 2C oligomerization. FMDV 2C targets lipid droplets (LDs) and induces LD clustering in cells, and PBL-peptide disrupts FMDV 2C-induced LD clustering. Finally, we demonstrate that PBL-peptide exhibits anti-FMDV activity in cells.

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 diabetes is a disorder of immune tolerance that leads to death of insulin-producing islet β cells. We hypothesize that inflammatory signaling within β cells promotes progression of autoimmunity within the islet microenvironment. To test this hypothesis, we deleted the proinflammatory gene encoding 12/15-lipoxygenase (Alox15) in β cells of non-obese diabetic mice at a pre-diabetic time point when islet inflammation is a feature. Deletion of Alox15 leads to preservation of β cell mass, reduces populations of infiltrating T cells, and protects against spontaneous autoimmune diabetes in both sexes. Mice lacking Alox15 in β cells exhibit an increase in a population of β cells expressing the gene encoding the protein programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which engages receptors on immune cells to suppress autoimmunity. Delivery of a monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 recovers the diabetes phenotype in knockout animals. Our results support the contention that inflammatory signaling in β cells promotes autoimmunity during type 1 diabetes progression.

Abstract: Summary
In mammalian cells, spurious transcription results in a vast repertoire of unproductive non-coding RNAs, whose deleterious accumulation is prevented by rapid decay. The nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex plays a central role in directing non-functional transcripts to exosome-mediated degradation, but the structural and molecular mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we elucidated the architecture of the human NEXT complex, showing that it exists as a dimer of MTR4-ZCCHC8-RBM7 heterotrimers. Dimerization preconfigures the major MTR4-binding region of ZCCHC8 and arranges the two MTR4 helicases opposite to each other, with each protomer able to function on many types of RNAs. In the inactive state of the complex, the 3′ end of an RNA substrate is enclosed in the MTR4 helicase channel by a ZCCHC8 C-terminal gatekeeping domain. The architecture of a NEXT-exosome assembly points to the molecular and regulatory mechanisms with which the NEXT complex guides RNA substrates to the exosome.

Abstract: Summary
Non-core spliceosome components are essential, conserved regulators of alternative splicing. They provide concentration-dependent control of diverse pre-mRNAs. Many splicing factors direct unproductive splicing of their own pre-mRNAs through negative autoregulation. However, the impact of such feedback loops on splicing dynamics at the single-cell level remains unclear. Here, we developed a system to quantitatively analyze negative autoregulatory splicing dynamics by splicing factor SRSF1 in response to perturbations in single HEK293 cells. We show that negative autoregulatory splicing provides critical functions for gene regulation, establishing a ceiling of SRSF1 protein concentration, reducing cell-cell heterogeneity in SRSF1 levels, and buffering variation in transcription. Most important, it adapts SRSF1 splicing activity to variations in demand from other pre-mRNA substrates. A minimal mathematical model of autoregulatory splicing explains these experimentally observed features and provides values for effective biochemical parameters. These results reveal the unique functional roles that splicing negative autoregulation plays in homeostatically regulating transcriptional programs.

Abstract: Summary
Alveolar formation increases the surface area for gas exchange. A molecular understanding of alveologenesis remains incomplete. Here, we show that the autonomic nerve and alveolar myofibroblast form a functional unit in mice. Myofibroblasts secrete neurotrophins to promote neurite extension/survival, whereas neurotransmitters released from autonomic terminals are necessary for myofibroblast proliferation and migration, a key step in alveologenesis. This establishes a functional link between autonomic innervation and alveolar formation. We also discover that planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling employs a Wnt-Fz/Ror-Vangl cascade to regulate the cytoskeleton and neurotransmitter trafficking/release from the terminals of autonomic nerves. This represents a new aspect of PCP signaling in conferring cellular properties. Together, these studies offer molecular insight into how autonomic activity controls alveolar formation. Our work also illustrates the fundamental principle of how two tissues (e.g., nerves and lungs) interact to build alveoli at the organismal level.

Abstract: Summary
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a liver disease associated with significant morbidity. Kupffer cells (KCs) produce endogenous miR-690 and, via exosome secretion, shuttle this miRNA to other liver cells, such as hepatocytes, recruited hepatic macrophages (RHMs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). miR-690 directly inhibits fibrogenesis in HSCs, inflammation in RHMs, and de novo lipogenesis in hepatocytes. When an miR-690 mimic is administered to NASH mice in vivo, all the features of the NASH phenotype are robustly inhibited. During the development of NASH, KCs become miR-690 deficient, and miR-690 levels are markedly lower in mouse and human NASH livers than in controls. KC-specific KO of miR-690 promotes NASH pathogenesis. A primary target of miR-690 is NADK mRNA, and NADK levels are inversely proportional to the cellular miR-690 content. These studies show that KCs play a central role in the etiology of NASH and raise the possibility that miR-690 could emerge as a therapeutic for this condition.

Abstract: Summary
Hyperosmotic stress as physiologic dysfunction can reduce the cell volume and then redistribute both protein concentration and ionic strength, but its effect on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is not well understood. Here, we map the hyperosmotic-stress-induced nuclear LLPS of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-related proteins (fused in sarcoma [FUS], TAR DNA-binding protein 43 [TDP-43]). The dynamic and reversibility of FUS granules are continuable with the increase of hypertonic stimulation time, but those of TDP-43 granules decrease significantly. Strikingly, FUS granules, but not TDP-43 granules, contain essential chaperone Hsp40, which can protect amyloid protein from solid aggregation. Moreover, FUS nuclear granules can co-localize with paraspeckles, but not promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies or nuclear speckles, while TDP-43 nuclear granules cannot co-localize with the above nuclear bodies. Together, these results may broaden our understanding of the LLPS of ALS-related proteins in response to cellular stress.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate detection of somatic structural variation (SV) in cancer genomes remains a challenging problem. This is in part due to the lack of high-quality, gold-standard datasets that enable the benchmarking of experimental approaches and bioinformatic analysis pipelines. Here, we performed somatic SV analysis of the paired melanoma and normal lymphoblastoid COLO829 cell lines using four different sequencing technologies. Based on the evidence from multiple technologies combined with extensive experimental validation, we compiled a comprehensive set of carefully curated and validated somatic SVs, comprising all SV types. We demonstrate the utility of this resource by determining the SV detection performance as a function of tumor purity and sequence depth, highlighting the importance of assessing these parameters in cancer genomics projects. The truth somatic SV dataset as well as the underlying raw multi-platform sequencing data are freely available and are an important resource for community somatic benchmarking efforts.

Abstract: Summary
The clinical outcome and disease severity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are heterogeneous, and the progression or fatality of the disease cannot be explained by a single factor like age or comorbidities. In this study, we used system-wide network-based system biology analysis using whole blood RNA sequencing, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry, plasma metabolomics, and single-cell-type metabolomics of monocytes to identify the potential determinants of COVID-19 severity at personalized and group levels. Digital cell quantification and immunophenotyping of the mononuclear phagocytes indicated a substantial role in coordinating the immune cells that mediate COVID-19 severity. Stratum-specific and personalized genome-scale metabolic modeling indicated monocarboxylate transporter family genes (e.g., SLC16A6), nucleoside transporter genes (e.g., SLC29A1), and metabolites such as α-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate, and butyrate could play a crucial role in COVID-19 severity. Metabolic perturbations targeting the central metabolic pathway (TCA cycle) can be an alternate treatment strategy in severe COVID-19.

Abstract: Summary
It has been proposed that the intrinsic property of nucleosome arrays to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro is responsible for chromatin domain organization in vivo. However, understanding nucleosomal LLPS has been hindered by the challenge to characterize the structure of the resulting heterogeneous condensates. We used cryo-electron tomography and deep-learning-based 3D reconstruction/segmentation to determine the molecular organization of condensates at various stages of LLPS. We show that nucleosomal LLPS involves a two-step process: a spinodal decomposition process yielding irregular condensates, followed by their unfavorable conversion into more compact, spherical nuclei that grow into larger spherical aggregates through accretion of spinodal materials or by fusion with other spherical condensates. Histone H1 catalyzes more than 10-fold the spinodal-to-spherical conversion. We propose that this transition involves exposure of nucleosome hydrophobic surfaces causing modified inter-nucleosome interactions. These results suggest a physical mechanism by which chromatin may transition from interphase to metaphase structures.

Abstract: Tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM) is a progressive skeletal muscle disease associated with gain-of-function mutations in the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1 that mediates store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) across the Ca2+-release-activated (CRAC) Ca2+ channel ORAI1. A frameshift mutation in STIM1 inactivation domain, STIM1I484R, was identified in a TAM patient and reported to decrease SOCE. Using ion imaging and electrophysiology, we show that the STIM1I484R mutation instead renders STIM1 constitutively active. In ion imaging experiments, STIM1I484R was less efficient than native STIM1 when expressed alone but enhanced SOCE and increased basal Ca2+ and Mn2+ influx when expressed together with ORAI1. In patch-clamp recordings, STIM1I484R generated larger pre-activated CRAC currents lacking slow Ca2+-dependent inhibition (SCDI). STIM1I484R was pre-recruited in plasma membrane clusters when co-expressed with ORAI1, as were mutants truncated at the frameshift residue or lacking EB-1-binding, which recapitulated STIM1I484R gain-of-function. When expressed alone in human primary myoblasts, STIM1I484R was pre-recruited in large clusters and increased basal Ca2+ entry. These observations establish that STIM1I484R confers a gain of CRAC channel function due to the loss of critical inhibitory C-terminal domains that prevent STIM1 binding to ORAI1, enable STIM1 trapping by microtubules, and mediate SCDI, providing a mechanistic explanation for the muscular defects of TAM patients bearing this mutation.

Abstract: Summary
mRNA function is influenced by modifications that modulate canonical nucleobase behavior. We show that a single modification mediates distinct impacts on mRNA translation in a position-dependent manner. Although cytidine acetylation (ac4C) within protein-coding sequences stimulates translation, ac4C within 5′ UTRs impacts protein synthesis at the level of initiation. 5′ UTR acetylation promotes initiation at upstream sequences, competitively inhibiting annotated start codons. Acetylation further directly impedes initiation at optimal AUG contexts: ac4C within AUG-flanking Kozak sequences reduced initiation in base-resolved transcriptome-wide HeLa results and in vitro utilizing substrates with site-specific ac4C incorporation. Cryo-EM of mammalian 80S initiation complexes revealed that ac4C in the −1 position adjacent to an AUG start codon disrupts an interaction between C and hypermodified t6A at nucleotide 37 of the initiator tRNA. These findings demonstrate the impact of RNA modifications on nucleobase function at a molecular level and introduce mRNA acetylation as a factor regulating translation in a location-specific manner.

Abstract: We imaged ‘papilla cells’ in the skin pores of ampullary organs in electroreceptors on the rostrum of freshwater paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), by lectin labeling and fluorescence stack imaging of frozen sections. >50,000 ampullary organs, each 0.3–0.5 mm deep, are embedded in special skin covering the rostrum; their skin pores offer invasion routes into the body interior. We imaged numerous small papillas, of lengths 6-31 microns, lining the luminal surfaces of the narrowed neck and skin pore, at the entrance to each ampullary organ. Lectins WGA or SBA labeled their surfaces. Each papilla led to an oblong base containing a nucleus, embedded in the cuboidal epithelium of the neck wall; the papillas were anucleate. Our immunolabeling of junctions between papilla cells for ZO1, TJP2, occludin, tricellulin, phalloidin, or collagen-1 was consistent with zona occludens. We confirmed the two-part morphology of papilla cells by acute dissociation of individual neck epithelial cells (using two methods), which showed a conical papilla, angled (on some) relative to a nucleated base. We propose that papilla cells may be defensive in function, strategically located at the skin pore and neck to deter entry of pathogens into ampullary organs, including microbes or small parasites.

Abstract: Summary
SHARPIN regulates signaling from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and pattern-recognition receptors. An inactivating Sharpin mutation in mice causes TNF-mediated dermatitis. Blocking cell death prevents the phenotype, implicating TNFR1-induced cell death in causing the skin disease. However, the source of TNF that drives dermatitis is unknown. Immune cells are a potent source of TNF in vivo and feature prominently in the skin pathology; however, T cells, B cells, and eosinophils are dispensable for the skin phenotype. We use targeted in vivo cell ablation, immune profiling, and extensive imaging to identify immune populations driving dermatitis. We find that systemic depletion of Langerin+ cells significantly reduces disease severity. This is enhanced in mice that lack Langerhans cells (LCs) from soon after birth. Reconstitution of LC-depleted Sharpin mutant mice with TNF-deficient LCs prevents dermatitis, implicating LCs as a potential cellular source of pathogenic TNF and highlighting a T cell-independent role in driving skin inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Muscle regeneration is known to be defective under diabetic conditions. However, the underlying mechanisms remain less clear. Adult quiescent muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) from leptin-receptor-deficient (i.e., db/db) diabetic mice are defective in early activation in vivo, but not in culture, suggesting the involvement of pathogenic niche factors. Elevated extracellular adenosine (eAdo) and AMP (eAMP) are detected under diabetic conditions. eAdo and eAMP potently inhibit cell cycle re-entry of quiescent MuSCs and injury-induced muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, eAdo and eAMP engage the equilibrative Ado transporters (ENTs)-Ado kinase (ADK)-AMPK signaling axis in MuSCs to inhibit the mTORC1-dependent cell growth checkpoint. eAdo and eAMP also inhibit early activation of quiescent fibroadipogenic progenitors and human MuSCs by the same mechanism. Treatment of db/db diabetic mice with an ADK inhibitor partially rescues the activation defects of MuSCs in vivo. Thus, both ADK and ENTs represent potential therapeutic targets for restoring the regenerative functions of tissue stem cells in patients with diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated growth factor receptor pathways, RNA modifications, and metabolism each promote tumor heterogeneity. Here, we demonstrate that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling induces N6-methyladenosine (m6A) accumulation in glioblastoma (GBM) stem cells (GSCs) to regulate mitophagy. PDGF ligands stimulate early growth response 1 (EGR1) transcription to induce methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) to promote GSC proliferation and self-renewal. Targeting the PDGF-METTL3 axis inhibits mitophagy by regulating m6A modification of optineurin (OPTN). Forced OPTN expression phenocopies PDGF inhibition, and OPTN levels portend longer survival of GBM patients; these results suggest a tumor-suppressive role for OPTN. Pharmacologic targeting of METTL3 augments anti-tumor efficacy of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) and mitophagy inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, we define PDGF signaling as an upstream regulator of oncogenic m6A regulation, driving tumor metabolism to promote cancer stem cell maintenance, highlighting PDGF-METTL3-OPTN signaling as a GBM therapeutic target.

Here, we show that this migration is mediated by cyclic changes in the activity of a small GTPase RhoA, which is dependent on the oscillatory changes in the activity and abundance of the RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GEF-H1, and triggered by a persistent increase in the intracellular Ca2+ levels. We show that the molecular clock driving these cyclic changes is mediated by two coupled negative feedback loops, dependent on the microtubule dynamics, with a frequency that can be experimentally modulated based on a predictive mathematical model. We further demonstrate that an increasing frequency of the clock translates into a faster cell migration within physically confining spaces. This work lays the foundation for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms dynamically driving cell migration in complex environments.

Abstract: This study aimed to reveal the cross association of the Wnt-Smad pathway in AS fibroblasts. Fibroblasts from hip synovial tissue were isolated, and the expressions of Wnt and Smad pathway proteins were detected by western blot analysis. DKK-1 and SIS3 were used to inhibit Wnt and Smad, respectively. The proliferation and apoptosis of AS fibroblasts were detected by CCK-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. And the effects of DKK-1 and/or SIS3 on osteogenic differentiation of AS fibroblasts were investigated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, intracellular calcium concentration, mineralization and osteogenic proteins expressions. Results showed that AS fibroblasts had stronger osteogenic differentiation ability, accompanied by activation of Wnt and Smad pathways. In AS fibroblasts, inhibition of Wnt by DKK-1 could affect the Smad pathway, while inhibition of Smad by SIS3 affect the Wnt pathway, DKK-1 and SIS3 showed a synergistic effect on the regulation of Wnt and Smad. In addition, DKK-1 and SIS3 also showed synergistic positive effects in inhibiting the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of AS fibroblasts. In conclusion, there was an interaction between Wnt and Smad pathways in AS fibroblasts. DKK-1 and SIS3 can synergistically and negatively regulate the osteogenic differentiation of AS fibroblasts, showing positive effects on AS.

Abstract: Background
Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is the key reason of injury after testicular torsion and may eventually lead to male infertility. Oleuropein, a natural antioxidant isolated from Olea europaea, has shown beneficial effects in different models of ischemia. We evaluated the effects of oleuropein on testicular IRI and explored the underlying protective mechanisms.
Methods
A mouse testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D) model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) germ cell model were established and treated with oleuropein. H&E staining was used to evaluate testicular pathological changes. Apoptosis and apoptosis-associated protein levels in testis tissues were assessed by TUNEL staining, immunohistochemical staining and western blot. Apoptosis levels and apoptosis-associated protein levels in GC-1 were evaluated by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and western blot. Oxidative stress levels were assessed by malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) kits. Cell viability and inflammatory protein levels were evaluated by CCK-8 assay coupled with qRT-PCR.
Results
Relative to the control group, SOD activity was markedly suppressed, while MDA, Bax, Caspase-3, TNF-α as well as IL-1β levels were significantly increased in the T/D model and OGD/R model. However, all of the aforementioned alterations were relieved by oleuropein treatment.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that oleuropein may be a promising treatment option to attenuate testicular IRI via its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory as well as anti-apoptotic properties.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be important regulators in the progression of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) activity of lncRNAs plays crucial roles in osteogenesis. We identified the mechanism of the differentially expressed lncRNA MALAT1 in AS using bioinformatic analysis and its ceRNA mechanism. The interaction of MALAT1, microRNA-558, and GSDMD was identified using integrated bioinformatics analysis and validated. Loss- and gain-of-function assays evaluated their effects on the viability, apoptosis, pyroptosis and inflammation of chondrocytes in AS. We found elevated MALAT1 and GSDMD but reduced miR-558 in AS cartilage tissues and chondrocytes. MALAT1 contributed to the suppression of cell viability and facilitated apoptosis and pyroptosis in AS chondrocytes. GSDMD was a potential target gene of miR-558. Depletion of MALAT1 expression elevated miR-558 by inhibiting GSDMD to enhance cell viability and inhibit inflammation, apoptosis and pyroptosis of chondrocytes in AS. In summary, our key findings demonstrated that knockdown of MALAT1 served as a potential suppressor of AS by upregulating miR-558 via the downregulation of GSDMD expression.

Abstract: In humans, there are three paralogs of the Orai Ca2+ channel that form the core of the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) machinery. While the STIM-mediated gating mechanism of Orai channels is still under active investigation, several artificial and natural variants are known to cause constitutive activity of the human Orai1 channel. Surprisingly, little is known about the conservation of the gating checkpoints among the different human Orai paralogs and orthologs in other species. In our work, we show that the mutation corresponding to the activating mutation H134A in transmembrane helix 2 (TM2) of human Orai1 also activates Orai2 and Orai3, likely via a similar mechanism. However, this cross-paralog conservation does not apply to the “ANSGA” nexus mutations in TM4 of human Orai1, which is reported to mimic the STIM1-activated state of the channel. In investigating the mechanistic background of these differences, we identified two positions, H171 and F246 in human Orai1, that are not conserved among paralogs and that seem to be crucial for the channel activation triggered by the “ANSGA” mutations in Orai1. However, mutations of the same residues still allow gating of Orai1 by STIM1, suggesting that the ANSGA mutant of Orai1 may not be a surrogate for the STIM1-activated state of the Orai1 channel. Our results shed new light on these important gating checkpoints and show that the gating mechanism of Orai channels is affected by multiple factors that are not necessarily conserved among orai homologs, such as the TM4-TM3 coupling.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer mortality is primarily a consequence of its metastatic spread. Here, we report that methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA), which can reduce oxidized methionine residues, acts as a suppressor of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) metastasis. MSRA expression is decreased in the metastatic tumors of PDA patients, whereas MSRA loss in primary PDA cells promotes migration and invasion. Chemoproteomic profiling of pancreatic organoids revealed that MSRA loss results in the selective oxidation of a methionine residue (M239) in pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Moreover, M239 oxidation sustains PKM2 in an active tetrameric state to promote respiration, migration, and metastasis, whereas pharmacological activation of PKM2 increases cell migration and metastasis in vivo. These results demonstrate that methionine residues can act as reversible redox switches governing distinct signaling outcomes and that the MSRA-PKM2 axis serves as a regulatory nexus between redox biology and cancer metabolism to control tumor metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a unique metabolic niche that can inhibit T cell metabolism and cytotoxicity. To dissect the metabolic interplay between tumors and T cells, we establish an in vitro system that recapitulates the metabolic niche of the TME and allows us to define cell-specific metabolism. We identify tumor-derived lactate as an inhibitor of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, revealing an unexpected metabolic shunt in the TCA cycle. Metabolically fit cytotoxic T cells shunt succinate out of the TCA cycle to promote autocrine signaling via the succinate receptor (SUCNR1). Cytotoxic T cells are reliant on pyruvate carboxylase (PC) to replenish TCA cycle intermediates. By contrast, lactate reduces PC-mediated anaplerosis. The inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is sufficient to restore PC activity, succinate secretion, and the activation of SUCNR1. These studies identify PDH as a potential drug target to allow CD8+ T cells to retain cytotoxicity and overcome a lactate-enriched TME.

Abstract: Protocadherin 8 (PCDH8) is lower-expressed in many cancers (gastric cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer), while the molecular mechanism underlying its effects in human colorectal cancer has not been reported. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the mechanism of PCDH8 in colorectal cancer. After colorectal cancer cells transfected with overexpressing or silencing the gene PCDH8, then the effects of PCDH8 on cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis were determined by a series of molecular biological experiments, respectively. The expressions of apoptosis-related factors, AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were quantified by western blotting. PCDH8 expression was significantly reduced in the colorectal cancer tissue and cell lines. Overexpressed PCDH8 significantly reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells, while silent PCDH8 had the opposite effects. Moreover, overexpressed PCDH8 could induce apoptosis, significantly down-regulate expressions of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), N-Cadherin and Vimentin but up-regulate those of Bcl-2 associated X (Bax), cleaved caspase-3 and E-Cadherin, whereas the negative regulations on the apoptosis and the expressions of apoptosis- and EMT-related proteins were observed in colorectal cancer cells following the silence of PCDH8. Furthermore, overexpressed PCDH8 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3β, and repressed the expression of β-catenin, while silent PCDH8 had the opposite effects. In short, PCDH8 overexpression inhibits proliferation, invasion, EMT, and induces apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells by regulating AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Coordination of inter-tissue stress signaling is essential for organismal fitness. Neuronal mitochondrial perturbations activate the mitochondrial unfolded-protein response (UPRmt) in the intestine via the mitokine Wnt signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we found that the protein disulfide isomerase PDI-6 coordinates inter-tissue UPRmt signaling via regulating the Wnt ligand EGL-20. PDI-6 is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and interacts with EGL-20 through disulfide bonds that are essential for EGL-20 stability and secretion. pdi-6 deficiency results in misfolded EGL-20, which leads to its degradation via ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) machinery. Expression of PDI-6 declines drastically with aging, and animals with pdi-6 deficiency have decreased lifespan. Overexpression of PDI-6 is sufficient to maintain Wnt/EGL-20 protein levels during aging, activating the UPRmt, and significantly extending lifespan in a Wnt- and UPRmt-dependent manner. Our study reveals that protein disulfide isomerase facilitates Wnt secretion to coordinate the inter-tissue UPRmt signaling and organismal aging.

Abstract: Summary
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, fostering an inflammation-enriched microenvironment that facilitates angiogenesis and immune evasion. However, the PGE2 receptor subtype (EP1–EP4) involved in neuroblastoma (NB) growth remains elusive. Herein, we show that the EP2 receptor highly correlates with NB aggressiveness and acts as a predominant Gαs-coupled receptor mediating PGE2-initiated cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling in NB cells with high-risk factors, including 11q deletion and MYCN amplification. Knockout of EP2 in NB cells blocks the development of xenografts, and its conditional knockdown prevents established tumors from progressing. Pharmacological inhibition of EP2 by our recently developed antagonist TG6-129 suppresses the growth of NB xenografts in nude mice and syngeneic allografts in immunocompetent hosts, accompanied by anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and apoptotic effects. This proof-of-concept study suggests that the PGE2/EP2 signaling pathway contributes to NB malignancy and that EP2 inhibition by our drug-like compounds provides a promising strategy to treat this deadly pediatric cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a signaling protein required for long-term memory. When activated by Ca2+/CaM, it sustains activity even after the Ca2+ dissipates. In addition to the well-known autophosphorylation-mediated mechanism, interaction with specific binding partners also persistently activates CaMKII. A long-standing model invokes two distinct S and T sites. If an interactor binds at the T-site, then it will preclude autoinhibition and allow substrates to be phosphorylated at the S site. Here, we specifically test this model with X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemistry. Our data are inconsistent with this model. Co-crystal structures of four different activators or substrates show that they all bind to a single continuous site across the kinase domain. We propose a mechanistic model where persistent CaMKII activity is facilitated by high-affinity binding partners that kinetically compete with autoinhibition by the regulatory segment to allow substrate phosphorylation.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate and efficient folding of nascent protein sequences into their native states requires support from the protein homeostasis network. Herein we probe which newly translated proteins are thermo-sensitive, making them susceptible to misfolding and aggregation under heat stress using pulse-SILAC mass spectrometry. We find a distinct group of proteins that is highly sensitive to this perturbation when newly synthesized but not once matured. These proteins are abundant and highly structured. Notably, they display a tendency to form β sheet secondary structures, have more complex folding topology, and are enriched for chaperone-binding motifs, suggesting a higher demand for chaperone-assisted folding. These polypeptides are also more often components of stable protein complexes in comparison with other proteins. Combining these findings suggests the existence of a specific subset of proteins in the cell that is particularly vulnerable to misfolding and aggregation following synthesis before reaching the native state.

Abstract: Summary
Vaccine boosters and infection can facilitate the development of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with improved potency and breadth. Here, we observe superimmunity in a camelid extensively immunized with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD). We rapidly isolate a large repertoire of specific ultra-high-affinity nanobodies that bind strongly to all known sarbecovirus clades using integrative proteomics. These pan-sarbecovirus nanobodies (psNbs) are highly effective against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron, with the best median neutralization potency at single-digit nanograms per milliliter. A highly potent, inhalable, and bispecific psNb (PiN-31) is also developed. Structural determinations of 13 psNbs with the SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD reveal five epitope classes, providing insights into the mechanisms and evolution of their broad activities. The highly evolved psNbs target small, flat, and flexible epitopes that contain over 75% of conserved RBD surface residues. Their potencies are strongly and negatively correlated with the distance of the epitopes from the receptor binding sites.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated cellular metabolism is a cancer hallmark for which few druggable oncoprotein targets have been identified. Increased fatty acid (FA) acquisition allows cancer cells to meet their heightened membrane biogenesis, bioenergy, and signaling needs. Excess FAs are toxic to non-transformed cells but surprisingly not to cancer cells. Molecules underlying this cancer adaptation may provide alternative drug targets. Here, we demonstrate that diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), an enzyme integral to triacylglyceride synthesis and lipid droplet formation, is frequently up-regulated in melanoma, allowing melanoma cells to tolerate excess FA. DGAT1 over-expression alone transforms p53-mutant zebrafish melanocytes and co-operates with oncogenic BRAF or NRAS for more rapid melanoma formation. Antagonism of DGAT1 induces oxidative stress in melanoma cells, which adapt by up-regulating cellular reactive oxygen species defenses. We show that inhibiting both DGAT1 and superoxide dismutase 1 profoundly suppress tumor growth through eliciting intolerable oxidative stress.

Abstract: Summary
Actin network architecture and dynamics play a central role in cell contractility and tissue morphogenesis. RhoA-driven pulsed contractions are a generic mode of actomyosin contractility, but the mechanisms underlying how their specific architecture emerges and how this architecture supports the contractile function of the network remain unclear. Here we show that, during pulsed contractions, the actin network is assembled by two subpopulations of formins: a functionally inactive population (recruited) and formins actively participating in actin filament elongation (elongating). We then show that elongating formins assemble a polar actin network, with barbed ends pointing out of the pulse. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this geometry favors rapid network contraction. Our results show that formins convert a local RhoA activity gradient into a polar network architecture, causing efficient network contractility, underlying the key function of kinetic controls in the assembly and mechanics of cortical network architectures.

Abstract: Cervical and endometrial cancers are common gynecologic cancers. Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 14B (PPP1R14B) is aberrantly expressed in several tumors, while its functions in cervical and endometrial cancers remain largely uncertain. The differentially expression of PPP1R14B in cervical and endometrial cancers was predicted by GEPIA2 and Human Protein Atlas databases. The diagnostic value was analyzed by AUC curve. The association between PPP1R14B expression and overall survival was predicted using Kaplan-Meier Plotter database. The function of PPP1R14B was investigated according to in vitro assessment. PPP1R14B and phosphorylation level of Akt were analyzed through western blotting. Cell proliferation was investigated by CCK-8 and EdU staining assays. Cell apoptosis was evaluated via TUNEL staining and caspase-3 activity assays. PPP1R14B level was upregulated in cervical and endometrial cancers, and it was associated with diagnosis and worse prognosis. PPP1R14B silencing constrained cell proliferation and promoted cell death in cervical and endometrial cancers cells. PPP1R14B knockdown suppressed activation of the Akt pathway. Re-activation of the Akt signaling reversed the anti-proliferative and cell death-promoting roles of PP1R14B knockdown in cervical and endometrial cancers cells. In conclusion, PPP1R14B knockdown represses cell proliferation and facilitates cell death by inhibiting the activation of the Akt signaling in cervical and endometrial cancers.

Abstract: Summary
The initial cephalic phase of insulin secretion is mediated through the vagus nerve and is not due to glycemic stimulation of pancreatic β cells. Recently, IL-1β was shown to stimulate postprandial insulin secretion. Here, we describe that this incretin-like effect of IL-1β involves neuronal transmission. Furthermore, we found that cephalic phase insulin release was mediated by IL-1β originating from microglia. Moreover, IL-1β activated the vagus nerve to induce insulin secretion and regulated the activity of the hypothalamus in response to cephalic stimulation. Notably, cephalic phase insulin release was impaired in obesity, in both mice and humans, and in mice, this was due to dysregulated IL-1β signaling. Our findings attribute a regulatory role to IL-1β in the integration of nutrient-derived sensory information, subsequent neuronally mediated insulin secretion, and the dysregulation of autonomic cephalic phase responses in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammation known as inflammaging in multiple tissues, representing a risk factor for age-related diseases. Dietary restriction (DR) is the best-known non-invasive method to ameliorate aging in many organisms. However, the molecular mechanism and the signaling pathways that drive inflammaging across different tissues and how they are modulated by DR are not yet understood. Here we identify a multi-tissue gene network regulating inflammaging. This network is characterized by chromatin opening and upregulation in the transcription of innate immune system receptors and by activation of interferon signaling through interferon regulatory factors, inflammatory cytokines, and Stat1-mediated transcription. DR ameliorates aging-induced alterations of chromatin accessibility and RNA transcription of the inflammaging gene network while failing to rescue those alterations on the rest of the genome. Our results present a comprehensive understanding of the molecular network regulating inflammation in aging and DR and provide anti-inflammaging therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Demyelination disease as diabetes mellitus (DM) complication is characterized by apoptosis of Schwann cells (SCs) and several reports have demonstrated that high glucose content can induce an inflammation response and lead to the apoptosis of SCs. For NF-κB plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory response, hence we hypothesized that high glucose content can induce inflammation though the NF-κB pathway. First we verified that 150 mM high glucose can increase the expression of cleaved caspase 3, interleukin (IL)− 1β, Cyto-C and NF-κB with time through Western blot and increase the apoptosis of RSC96s through Flow Cytometry. Then we found that high glucose can increase the nuclear translocation NF-κB through confocal system which can promote the expression of inflammation genes such as IL-1β. Curcumin has been reported to possess anti-inflammation activities to protect cells. In this study, we found that application with 25 μM curcumin could alleviate the inflammation response and protect the cells from apoptosis. We revealed that the expression of NF-κB and p-NF-κB was decreased and the translocation was also inhibited after curcumin application. Accordingly, the secretion of IL-1β and the apoptosis of RSC96s induce by high glucose was suppressed. Our cumulative findings suggest that curcumin can protect SCs from apoptosis through the inhibition of the inflammatory response though the NF-κB pathway.

Abstract: In cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs), a network of Ca2+ channels, pumps and Ca2+-binding proteins (CaBPs) regulates the localization, spread, and magnitude of free Ca2+ ions. During early postnatal development, OHCs express three prominent mobile EF-hand CaBPs: oncomodulin (OCM), α-parvalbumin (APV) and sorcin. We have previously shown that deletion of Ocm (Ocm-/-) gives rise to progressive cochlear dysfunction in young adult mice. Here, we show that changes in Ca2+ signaling begin early in postnatal development of Ocm-/- mice. While mutant OHCs exhibit normal electrophysiological profiles compared to controls, their intracellular Ca2+ signaling is altered. The onset of OCM expression at postnatal day 3 (P3) causes a developmental change in KCl-induced Ca2+ transients in OHCs and leads to slower KCl-induced Ca2+ transients than those elicited in cells from Ocm-/- littermates. We compared OCM buffering kinetics with other CaBPs in animal models and cultured cells. In a double knockout of Ocm and Apv (Ocm-/-;Apv-/-), mutant OHCs show even faster Ca2+ kinetics, suggesting that APV may also contribute to early postnatal Ca2+ signaling. In transfected HEK293T cells, OCM slows Ca2+ kinetics more so than either APV or sorcin. We conclude that OCM controls the intracellular Ca2+ environment by lowering the amount of freely available [Ca2+]i in OHCs and transfected HEK293T cells. We propose that OCM plays an important role in shaping the development of early OHC Ca2+ signals through its inimitable Ca2+ buffering capacity.

Abstract: We examined the time-dependent differences in the effects of treadmill exercise on joint contracture after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Rats received ACL reconstructive surgery. After surgery, rats were reared with or without treadmill exercise (60 min/day) starting at 3 days (when inflammatory reactions are active) or 14 days (when inflammatory reactions have subsided) post-surgery. Untreated rats were used as controls. Data were collected at two or four weeks post-surgery. The range of motion (ROM) decreased following surgery at both time points and treadmill exercise during the first two weeks post-surgery further decreased the ROM. Moreover, treadmill exercise during first two weeks post-surgery upregulated the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β gene in the joint capsule and aggravated joint capsule fibrosis. For exercise started at 14 days post-surgery, the ROM recovered to control levels at four weeks post-surgery. In addition, delayed exercise contributed to resolving inflammatory and fibrotic reactions. Treadmill exercise initiated soon after surgery aggravates joint contracture via enhanced inflammatory and fibrotic reactions in the joint capsule. Conversely, exercise initiated after active inflammation has subsided facilitates joint capsule reorganization and increases joint ROM. Therefore, aggressive exercise should be started only after active inflammation is resolved to improve joint contracture following ACL reconstruction.

Abstract: Summary
The germ-cell-specific RNA-binding protein (RBP) NANOS2 plays a pivotal role in male gonocyte differentiation and spermatogonial stem cell maintenance. Although NANOS2 interacts with the CNOT deadenylation complex and Dead end 1 (DND1) to repress target RNAs, the molecular mechanisms underlying target mRNA selection remain unclear because of the limited cell resource in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that exogenous NANOS2-DND1 suppresses target mRNAs in somatic cells. Using this somatic cell system, we find that NANOS2 interacts with RNA-bound DND1 and recruits the CNOT complex to the mRNAs. However, a fusion construct composed of the CNOT1-binding site of NANOS2 (NIM) and DND1 fails to repress the target gene expression. Therefore, NANOS2 is required not only for recruitment of the CNOT complex but also for selecting the target mRNA with DND1. This study reveals that NANOS2 functions as a second-layer RBP for the target recognition and functional adaptation of DND1.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-suppressive cell competition is an evolutionarily conserved process that selectively removes precancerous cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. Using the polarity-deficiency-induced cell competition model in Drosophila, we identify Toll-6, a Toll-like receptor family member, as a driver of tension-mediated cell competition through α-Spectrin (α-Spec)-Yorkie (Yki) cascade. Toll-6 aggregates along the boundary between wild-type and polarity-deficient clones, where Toll-6 physically interacts with the cytoskeleton network protein α-Spec to increase mechanical tension, resulting in actomyosin-dependent Hippo pathway activation and the elimination of scrib mutant cells. Furthermore, we show that Spz5 secreted from fat body, the key innate organ in fly, facilitates the elimination of scrib clones by binding to Toll-6. These findings uncover mechanisms by which fat bodies remotely regulate tumor-suppressive cell competition of polarity-deficient tumors through inter-organ crosstalk and identified the Toll-6-α-Spec axis as an essential guardian that prevents tumorigenesis via tension-mediated cell elimination.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the foremost neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and significant progressive memory loss. In AD, astrocytes are proposed to take up and clear Aβ plaques. However, how Aβ induces pathogenesis and memory impairment in AD remains elusive. We report that normal astrocytes show non-cyclic urea metabolism, whereas Aβ-treated astrocytes show switched-on urea cycle with upregulated enzymes and accumulated entering-metabolite aspartate, starting-substrate ammonia, end-product urea, and side-product putrescine. Gene silencing of astrocytic ornithine decarboxylase-1 (ODC1), facilitating ornithine-to-putrescine conversion, boosts urea cycle and eliminates aberrant putrescine and its toxic byproducts ammonia and H2O2 and its end product GABA to recover from reactive astrogliosis and memory impairment in AD. Our findings implicate that astrocytic urea cycle exerts opposing roles of beneficial Aβ detoxification and detrimental memory impairment in AD. We propose ODC1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD to facilitate removal of toxic molecules and prevent memory loss.

Abstract: Summary
Protein ubiquitination is an essential process that rapidly regulates protein synthesis, function, and fate in dynamic environments. Within its non-proteolytic functions, we showed that K63-linked polyubiquitinated conjugates heavily accumulate in yeast cells exposed to oxidative stress, stalling ribosomes at elongation. K63-ubiquitinated conjugates accumulate mostly because of redox inhibition of the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp2; however, the role and regulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) in this pathway remained unclear. Here, we show that the E2 Rad6 associates and modifies ribosomes during stress. We further demonstrate that Rad6 and its human homolog UBE2A are redox regulated by forming a reversible disulfide with the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (Uba1). This redox regulation is part of a negative feedback regulation, which controls the levels of K63 ubiquitination under stress. Finally, we show that Rad6 activity is necessary to regulate translation, antioxidant defense, and adaptation to stress, thus providing an additional physiological role for this multifunctional enzyme.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibitors of the mitotic kinesin Kif11 are anti-mitotics that, unlike vinca alkaloids or taxanes, do not disrupt microtubules and are not neurotoxic. However, development of resistance has limited their clinical utility. While resistance to Kif11 inhibitors in other cell types is due to mechanisms that prevent these drugs from disrupting mitosis, we find that in glioblastoma (GBM), resistance to the Kif11 inhibitor ispinesib works instead through suppression of apoptosis driven by activation of STAT3. This form of resistance requires dual phosphorylation of STAT3 residues Y705 and S727, mediated by SRC and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), respectively. Simultaneously inhibiting SRC and EGFR reverses this resistance, and combined targeting of these two kinases in vivo with clinically available inhibitors is synergistic and significantly prolongs survival in ispinesib-treated GBM-bearing mice. We thus identify a translationally actionable approach to overcoming Kif11 inhibitor resistance that may work to block STAT3-driven resistance against other anti-cancer therapies as well.

Abstract: Summary
We have developed a mouse DNA methylation array that contains 296,070 probes representing the diversity of mouse DNA methylation biology. We present a mouse methylation atlas as a rich reference resource of 1,239 DNA samples encompassing distinct tissues, strains, ages, sexes, and pathologies. We describe applications for comparative epigenomics, genomic imprinting, epigenetic inhibitors, patient-derived xenograft assessment, backcross tracing, and epigenetic clocks. We dissect DNA methylation processes associated with differentiation, aging, and tumorigenesis. Notably, we find that tissue-specific methylation signatures localize to binding sites for transcription factors controlling the corresponding tissue development. Age-associated hypermethylation is enriched at regions of Polycomb repression, while hypomethylation is enhanced at regions bound by cohesin complex members. ApcMin/+ polyp-associated hypermethylation affects enhancers regulating intestinal differentiation, while hypomethylation targets AP-1 binding sites. This Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip (version MM285) is widely accessible to the research community and will accelerate high-sample-throughput studies in this important model organism.

Abstract: Summary
In human embryos, major zygotic genome activation (ZGA) initiates at the eight-cell (8C) stage. Abnormal ZGA leads to developmental defects and even contributes to the failure of human blastocyst formation or implantation. An in vitro cell model mimicking human 8C blastomeres would be invaluable to understanding the mechanisms regulating key biological events during early human development. Using the non-canonical promoter of LEUTX that putatively regulates human ZGA, we developed an 8C::mCherry reporter, which specifically marks the 8C state, to isolate rare 8C-like cells (8CLCs) from human preimplantation epiblast-like stem cells. The 8CLCs express a panel of human ZGA genes and have a unique transcriptome resembling that of the human 8C embryo. Using the 8C::mCherry reporter, we further optimize the chemical-based culture condition to increase and maintain the 8CLC population. Functionally, 8CLCs can self-organize to form blastocyst-like structures. The discovery and maintenance of 8CLCs provide an opportunity to recapitulate early human development.

Abstract: Summary
The nervous system spread of alpha-synuclein fibrils is thought to cause Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies; however, the mechanisms underlying internalization and cellular spread are enigmatic. Here, we use confocal and superresolution microscopy, subcellular fractionation, and electron microscopy (EM) of immunogold-labeled α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs) to demonstrate that this form of the protein undergoes rapid internalization and is targeted directly to lysosomes in as little as 2 min. Uptake of PFFs is disrupted by macropinocytic inhibitors and circumvents classical endosomal pathways. Immunogold-labeled PFFs are seen at the highly curved inward edge of membrane ruffles, in newly formed macropinosomes, in multivesicular bodies and in lysosomes. While most fibrils remain in lysosomes, a portion is transferred to neighboring naive cells along with markers of exosomes. These data indicate that PFFs use a unique internalization mechanism as a component of cell-to-cell propagation.

Abstract: Summary
Protein import into mitochondria is a highly regulated process, yet how cells clear mitochondria undergoing dysfunctional protein import remains poorly characterized. Here we showed that mitochondrial protein import stress (MPIS) triggers localized LC3 lipidation. This arm of the mitophagy pathway occurs through the Nod-like receptor (NLR) protein NLRX1 while, surprisingly, without the engagement of the canonical mitophagy protein PINK1. Mitochondrial depolarization, which itself induces MPIS, also required NLRX1 for LC3 lipidation. While normally targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, cytosol-retained NLRX1 recruited RRBP1, a ribosome-binding transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, which relocated to the mitochondrial vicinity during MPIS, and the NLRX1/RRBP1 complex in turn controlled the recruitment and lipidation of LC3. Furthermore, NLRX1 controlled skeletal muscle mitophagy in vivo and regulated endurance capacity during exercise. Thus, localization and lipidation of LC3 at the site of mitophagosome formation is a regulated step of mitophagy controlled by NLRX1/RRBP1 in response to MPIS.

Abstract: Summary
Disruption of circadian glucocorticoid oscillations in Cushing’s disease and chronic stress results in obesity and adipocyte hypertrophy, which is believed to be a main source of the harmful effects of obesity. Here, we recapitulate stress due to jet lag or work-life imbalances by flattening glucocorticoid oscillations in mice. Within 3 days, mice achieve a metabolic state with persistently high insulin, but surprisingly low glucose and fatty acids in the bloodstream, that precedes a more than 2-fold increase in brown and white adipose tissue mass within 3 weeks. Transcriptomic and Cd36-knockout mouse analyses show that hyperinsulinemia-mediated de novo fatty acid synthesis and Cd36-mediated fatty acid uptake drive fat mass increases. Intriguingly, this mechanism by which glucocorticoid flattening causes acute hyperinsulinemia and adipocyte hypertrophy is unexpectedly beneficial in preventing high levels of circulating fatty acids and glucose for weeks, thus serving as a protective response to preserve metabolic health during chronic stress.

Abstract: Summary
Diabetic patients show elevated plasma IL18 concentrations. IL18 has two receptors: the IL18 receptor (IL18r) and the Na-Cl co-transporter (NCC). Here, we report that IL18 is expressed on islet α cells, NCC on β cells, and IL18r on acinar cells in human and mouse pancreases. The deficiency of these receptors reduces islet size, β cell proliferation, and insulin secretion but increases β cell apoptosis and exocrine macrophage accumulation after diet-induced glucose intolerance or streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia. Together with the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1), IL18 uses the NCC and GLP1 receptors on β cells to trigger β cell development and insulin secretion. IL18 also uses the IL18r on acinar cells to block hyperglycemic pancreas macrophage expansion. The β cell-selective depletion of the NCC or acinar-cell-selective IL18r depletion reduces glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity with impaired β cell proliferation, enhanced β cell apoptosis and macrophage expansion, and inflammation in mouse hyperglycemic pancreas. IL18 uses NCC, GLP1r, and IL18r to maintain islet β cell function and homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Celiac disease (CD) is a multisystem disease in which different organs may be affected. We investigate whether circulating innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) contribute to the CD peripheral inflammatory status. We find that the CD cytokine profile is characterized by high concentrations of IL-12p40, IL-18, and IFN-γ, paralleled by an expansion of ILC precursors (ILCPs). In the presence of the gliadin peptides p31–43 and pα-9, ILCPs from CD patients increase transglutaminase 2 (TG2) expression, produce IL-18 and IFN-γ, and stimulate CD4+ T lymphocytes. IFN-γ is also produced upon stimulation with IL-12p40 and IL-18 and is inhibited by the addition of vitamin D. Low levels of blood vitamin D correlate with high IFN-γ and ILCP presence and mark the CD population mostly affected by extraintestinal symptoms. Dietary vitamin D supplementation appears to be an interesting therapeutic approach to dampen ILCP-mediated IFN-γ production.
