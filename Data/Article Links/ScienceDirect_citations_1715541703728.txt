Abstract: Ischemic cell injury leads to cell death. Three main morphologies have been described: apoptosis, cell death with autophagy and necrosis. Their inherent dynamic nature, a point of no return (PONR) and molecular overlap have been stressed. The relationship between a defined cell death type and the severity of injury remains unclear. The functional role of autophagy and its effects on cell death onset is largely unknown. In this study we report a differential induction of cell death, which is dependent on the severity and duration of an ischemic insult. We show that mild ischemia leads to the induction of autophagy and apoptosis, while moderate or severe ischemia induces both apoptotic and necrotic cell death without increased autophagy. The autophagic response during mild injury was associated with an ATP surge. Real-time imaging and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) revealed that increased autophagy delays the PONR of both apoptosis and necrosis significantly. Blocking autophagy shifted PONR to an earlier point in time. Our results suggest that autophagic activity directly alters intracellular metabolic parameters, responsible for maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular membrane integrity. A similar treatment also improved functional recovery in the perfused rat heart. Taken together, we demonstrate a novel finding: autophagy is implicated only in mild injury and positions the PONR in cell death.

Abstract: Tumor angiogenesis and immune response have in common to be cell recognition mechanisms, which are based on specific adhesion molecules and dependent on nitric oxide (NO•). The aim of the present study is to deepen the mechanisms of angiogenesis and inflammation regulation by NO• to find out the molecular regulation processes that govern endothelial cell permeability and leukocyte transmigration. Effects of NO•, either exogenous or produced in hypoxic conditions, were studied on microvascular endothelial cells from skin and lymph node because of their strong involvement in melanoma progression. We found that NO• down-regulation of pseudo-vessel formation was linked to a decrease in endothelial cell ability to adhere to each other which can be explain, in part, by the inhibition of PECAM-1/CD31 expression. On the other hand, NO• was shown to be able to decrease leukocyte adhesion on an endothelial monolayer, performed either in static or in rolling conditions, and to modulate differentially CD34, ICAM-1/CD54, ICAM-2/CD102 and VCAM-1/CD106 expression. In conclusion, during angiogenesis and leukocyte recruitment, NO• regulates cell interactions by controlling adhesion molecule expression and subsequently cell adhesion. Moreover, each endothelial cell type presents its own organospecific response to NO•, reflecting the functions of the tissue they originate from.

Abstract: The question whether epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced receptor endocytosis requires the prior autophosphorylation via the EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase domain has been a matter of long-standing debate. In the airway epithelial cell line NCI-H292, the EGFR kinase domain inhibitor BIBW 2948 BS was found to inhibit both autophosphorylation and subsequent internalization of the endogenous EGFR with similar IC50 values. Applying an ex vivo EGFR internalization assay in a clinical study, the in vivo effect of inhalatively administered BIBW 2948 BS was determined directly at the targeted receptor in airway tissues from COPD patients. In these experiments, the in vivo inhibition of the EGFR kinase domain prevented the EGF-induced internalization of EGFR.

Abstract: Embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (ESC-CMs) have applications in understanding cardiac disease pathophysiology, pharmacology, and toxicology. Comprehensive characterization of their basic physiological and pharmacological properties is critical in determining the suitability of ESC-CMs as models of cardiac activity. In this study we use video microscopy and quantitative PCR to investigate the responses of mouse ESC-CMs to adrenoceptor, muscarinic, angiotensin II (Ang II), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor activation. Isoprenaline (10nM–10μM) increased beating rate and contraction amplitude in all beating bodies (BBs), whereas carbachol (up to 1μM) and the If channel blocker ZD-7288 (10μM) decreased contraction frequency. ET-1 (0.01–100nM) reduced contraction amplitude in all BBs and increased contraction frequency in 50% of BBs; these effects were blocked by the ETA receptor antagonist BQ123 (250nM). Ang II (0.01nM–1μM) increased both contraction amplitude (all BBs) and frequency (in 50% of BBs), effects blocked, respectively, by losartan (100nM) and PD123,319 (200nM). These results indicate the presence of functional ETA and both AT1 and AT2 receptors in murine ESC-CMs, but their expression and or activity appears to be evident only in a limited set of BBs.

Abstract: The precise localization of transcribed DNA and resulting RNA is an important aspect of the functional architecture of the nucleus. To this end we have developed a novel in situ hybridization approach in combination with immunoelectron microscopy, using sense and anti-sense RNA probes that are derived from total cellular or cytoplasmic poly(A+) RNA. This new technology is much more gentle than classical in situ hybridization using DNA probes and shows excellent preservation of nuclear structure. Carried out on ultrathin sections of fixed and resin-embedded COS-7 cells, it revealed at high resolution the localization of the genes that code for the cellular mRNAs. Quantitative analysis shows that most transcribed DNA is concentrated in the perichromatin region, i.e. the interface between subchromosomal compact chromatin domains and the interchromatin space essentially devoid of DNA. The RNA that is produced is found mainly in the perichromatin region and the interchromatin space. These results imply that in the mammalian nucleus the chromatin fiber is folded so that active genes are predominantly present in the perichromatin region, which is the most prominent site of transcription.

Abstract: Transverse (T) tubules comprise a tortuous network inside the skeletal myofibers enclosing a distinct osmotic environment. Here we have examined whether the T tubules contain aquaporin type 4 (AQP4) water channels to mediate rapid transmembrane water flow. Separation of T tubular and sarcolemmal membranes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed that two main isoforms of AQP4, namely M23 and M1, were present in both membrane fractions. Compatible with this, expression of fluorescent Venus-AQP4.M23 in rat muscle showed the protein both in the T tubules and at the sarcolemma. Blue-Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that higher order oligomers typical to the AQP4 water channel were present in both membrane compartments. Interestingly, α-syntrophin that mediates binding of AQP4 to the sarcolemmal dystrophin glycoprotein complex was also present in the T tubule fraction. Deletion of the syntrophin-binding sequence of AQP4 increased its mobile fraction at the sarcolemma but not in the T tubules. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that both the sarcolemma and the T tubules harbor higher order oligomers of the AQP4 water channel but the interactions with adjacent macromolecules are different.

Abstract: Erythropoiesis in β0-thalassaemia/Hb E patients, the most common variant form of β-thalassaemia in Southeast Asia, is characterized by accelerated differentiation and over-expansion of erythroid precursor cells. The mechanism driving this accelerated expansion and differentiation remain unknown. To address this issue a proteomic analysis was undertaken to firstly identify proteins differentially expressed during erythroblast differentiation and a second analysis was undertaken to identify proteins differentially expressed between β0-thalassaemia/Hb E erythroblasts and control erythroblasts. The majority of proteins identified as being differentially expressed between β0-thalassaemia/Hb E and control erythroblasts were constituents of the glycolysis/TCA pathway and levels of oxidative stress correlated with the degree of erythroid expansion. A model was constructed linking these observations with previous studies showing increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in thalassemic erythroblasts which predicted the increased activation of PKA, PKB and PKC which Western analysis confirmed. Inhibition of PKA or PKC reduced β0-thalassaemia/Hb E erythroblast differentiation and/or expansion. We propose that increased expansion and differentiation of β0-thalassaemia/Hb E erythroblasts occur as a result of feedback loops acting through increased oxidative metabolism.

SCFTrCP acts in endosomal sorting of the GH receptor,

Abstract: The ubiquitin ligase SCFTrCP is required for internalisation of the growth hormone receptor (GHR) and acts via a direct interaction with the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif. Details of how the ligase communicates its information to the clathrin-mediated internalisation machinery are unknown. For the EGF receptor, c-Cbl acts both at the cell surface and in endosomes. We hypothesised that SCFTrCP is required for GHR degradation at both sites. This was tested by truncating GHR after a di-leucine-based internalisation motif (GHR349). This receptor enters the cells via the adapter complex AP2. We show that TrCP acts in an early stage of cargo selection: both TrCP silencing and mutation of the ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis motif force the GHR to recycle between endosomes and the plasma membrane, together with the transferrin receptor. Depletion of Tsg101 (ESCRT-I) has the same effect, while silencing of Hrs (ESCRT-0) prevents GH recycling. GH passes through late endosomal vesicles, marked by Lamp1. Coexpressing GHR and EGFR demonstrates that both receptors use the same route to the lysosomes. We show for the first time that SCFTrCP is involved in cargo-specific sorting at endosomes and that Tsg101 rather than Hrs might direct the cargo into the ESCRT machinery.

Abstract: Unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSC) from human cord blood display a broad differentiation potential for ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal cell types. The molecular basis for these stem cell properties is unclear and unlike embryonic stem cells (ESC) none of the major stem cell factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG exhibits significant expression in USSC. Here, we report that these key stem cell genes hold an epigenetic state in between that of an ESC and a terminally differentiated cell type. DNA methylation analysis exhibits partial demethylation of the regulatory region of OCT4 and a demethylated state of the NANOG and SOX2 promoter/enhancer regions. Further genome-wide DNA methylation profiling identified a partially demethylated state of the telomerase gene hTERT. Moreover, none of the pluripotency factors exhibited a repressive histone signature. Notably, SOX2 exhibits a bivalent histone signature consisting of the opposing histone marks dimeH3K4 and trimeH3K27, which is typically found on genes that are "poised" for transcription. Consequently, ectopic expression of OCT4 in USSC led to rapid induction of expression of its known target gene SOX2. Our data suggest that incomplete epigenetic repression and a "poised" epigenetic status of pluripotency genes preserves the USSC potential to be able to react adequately to distinct differentiation and reprogramming cues.

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) adapts to persist in a nutritionally limited macrophage compartment. Lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), the third enzyme (E3) in Mtb's pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH), also serves as E1 of peroxynitrite reductase/peroxidase (PNR/P), which helps Mtb resist host-reactive nitrogen intermediates. In contrast to Mtb lacking dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (DlaT), the E2 of PDH and PNR/P, Lpd-deficient Mtb is severely attenuated in wild-type and immunodeficient mice. This suggests that Lpd has a function that DlaT does not share. When DlaT is absent, Mtb upregulates an Lpd-dependent branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKADH) encoded by pdhA, pdhB, pdhC, and lpdC. Without Lpd, Mtb cannot metabolize branched-chain amino acids and potentially toxic branched-chain intermediates accumulate. Mtb deficient in both DlaT and PdhC phenocopies Lpd-deficient Mtb. Thus, Mtb critically requires BCKADH along with PDH and PNR/P for pathogenesis. These findings position Lpd as a potential target for anti-infectives against Mtb.

Abstract: In order to update the molecular basis of β-thalassemia and describe hematological features among different mutations and the concurrent of α- and β-thalassemias, 849 unrelated β-thalassemia heterozygotes recruited in northeast Thailand during a prevention and control program were studied. β- and α-thalassemia mutations were investigated using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technologies and hematological parameters were recorded using standard methods. Seventeen different mutations including both β0- and β+ -thalassemias were identified. Eight of these 17 β-thalassemia alleles accounted for 97.4%, others were found at lower frequencies (<1.0%). Of the 849 cases, 626 were investigated for common α-thalassemia mutations and 155 (24.8%) were found to be co-inherited with different forms of α-thalassemia. Comparison of the hematological parameters among different β-thalassemia mutations revealed an increasing trend of MCV and MCH in a group of heterozygous states for the 3.4kb deletion and the A-G substitution at nucleotide (NT) -28. Hb A2 and Hb F levels in individuals with the 3.4kb deletion were significantly higher than those with other mutations. Interaction of each β-thalassemia mutation with α-thalassemia did not affect the diagnostic ranges of Hb A2 and Hb F, though the significantly increased MCV and MCH was noted. These findings underline the heterogeneity of β-thalassemia and the importance of hematological and molecular analyses of both α-and β-thalassemias in the diagnosis and genetic counseling of the couples at-risk of having babies with severe thalassemia diseases in the region.

Abstract: The muscle-specific protein NRAP is concentrated at cardiac intercalated disks, plays a role in myofibril assembly, and is upregulated early in mouse models of dilated cardiomyopathy. Using a tet-off system, we developed novel transgenic lines exhibiting cardiac-specific NRAP overexpression ~2.5 times greater than normal. At 40–50weeks, NRAP overexpression resulted in dilation and decreased ejection fraction in the right ventricle, with little effect on the left ventricle. Expression of transcripts encoding brain natriuretic peptide and skeletal α-actin was increased by cardiac-specific NRAP overexpression, indicative of a cardiomyopathic response. NRAP overexpression did not alter the levels or organization of N-cadherin and connexin-43. The results show that chronic NRAP overexpression in the mouse leads to right ventricular cardiomyopathy by 10months, but that the early NRAP upregulation previously observed in some mouse models of dilated cardiomyopathy is unlikely to account for the remodeling of intercalated disks and left ventricular dysfunction observed in those cases.

Abstract: Inhibition of p38MAPK alpha/beta is known to enhance 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin (1,25D)-induced monocytic differentiation, but the detailed mechanism of this effect was not clear. We now show that the enhancement of differentiation becomes apparent with slow kinetics (12–24h). Interestingly, the inhibition of p38MAPK alpha/beta by their selective inhibitor SB202190 (SB) leads to an upregulated expression of p38MAPK isoforms gamma and delta in 1,25D-treated AML cells, in cell lines and in primary culture. Although the expression and activating phosphorylations of p38MAPK alpha are also increased by an exposure of the cells to SB, its kinase activity is blocked by SB, as shown by reduced levels of phosphorylated Hsp27, a downstream target of p38MAPK alpha. A positive role of p38MAPKs in 1,25D-induced differentiation is shown by the inhibition of differentiation by antisense oligonucleotides to all p38MAPK isoforms. Other principal branches of MAPK pathways showed early (6h) activation of MEK/ERK by SB, followed by activation of JNK1/2 pathway and enhanced expression and/or activation of PU.1, ATF-2 differentiation-related transcription factors. Taken together with previous reports, the results indicate that 1,25D-induced differentiation is enhanced by the activation of at least three branches of MAPK pathways (ERK1/2; p38MAPK gamma/delta; JNK1/2). This activation may result from the removal of feedback inhibition of an upstream regulator of those pathways, when p38MAPK alpha and beta are inhibited by SB.

Abstract: Transfusion-independent patients with β thalassemia intermedia (TI) experience a variety of clinical complications attributed to the underlying ineffective erythropoiesis and subsequent anemia, hemolysis, and iron overload. Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) was recently investigated as a marker of ineffective erythropoiesis in several anemias. In this work, we evaluated GDF-15 levels in 55 patients with TI. The mean GDF-15 level was 25,197.8±16,208.9pg/ml which is lower than values reported for patients with thalassemia major, yet considerably higher than those reported in patients with other congenital and acquired anemias. GDF-15 levels were significantly higher in splenectomized compared to non-splenectomized patients and correlated with anemia, markers of iron overload, and a pre-defined clinical severity score. Further studies are needed to determine the practical utility of GDF-15 measurement and its potential to reflect the severity of the clinical course in TI patients.

Abstract: Rex-1/Zfp42 displays a remarkably restricted pattern of expression in preimplantation embryos, primary spermatocytes, and undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and is frequently used as a marker gene for pluripotent stem cells. To understand the role of Rex-1 in selfrenewal and pluripotency, we used Rex-1 association as a measure to identify potential target genes, and carried out chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays in combination with gene specific primers to identify genomic targets Rex-1 associates with. We find association of Rex-1 to several genes described previously as bivalently marked regulators of differentiation and development, whose repression in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells is Polycomb Group-mediated, and controlled directly by Ring1A/B. To substantiate the hypothesis that Rex-1 contributes to gene regulation by PcG, we demonstrate interactions of Rex-1 and YY2 (a close relative of YY1) with Ring1 proteins and the PcG-associated proteins RYBP and YAF2, in line with interactions reported previously for YY1. We also demonstrate the presence of Rex-1 protein in both trophectoderm and Inner Cell Mass of the mouse blastocyst and in both ES and in trophectoderm stem (TS) cells. In TS cells, we were unable to demonstrate association of Rex-1 to the genes it associates with in ES cells, suggesting that association may be cell-type specific. Rex-1 might fine-tune pluripotency in ES cells by modulating Polycomb-mediated gene regulation.

Abstract: The Drosophila gene yuri gagarin is a complex locus encoding three protein isoform classes that are ubiquitously expressed in the organism. Mutations to the gene affect processes as diverse as gravitactic behavior and spermatogenesis. The larger Yuri isoforms contain extensive coiled-coil regions. Our previous studies indicate that one of the large isoform classes (Yuri-65) is required for formation of specialized F-actin-containing structures generated during spermatogenesis, including the so-called actin “cones” that mediate spermatid individualization. We used the tandem affinity purification of a tagged version of Yuri-65 (the TAP-tagging technique) to identify proteins associated with Yuri-65 in the intact organism. Tropomyosin, primarily as the 284-residue isoform derived from the ubiquitously expressed Tropomyosin 1 gene was thus identified as a major Yuri interaction partner. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed this interaction. We have established that the stable F-actin cones of spermatogenesis contain Tropomyosin 1 (Tm1) and that in mutant yuriF64, failure of F-actin cone formation is associated with failure of Tm1 to accumulate at the cone initiation sites. In investigating possible interactions of Tm1 and Yuri in other tissues, we discovered that Tm1 and Yuri frequently colocalize with the endoplasmic reticulum. Tropomyosin has been implicated in actin-mediated membrane trafficking activity in other systems. Our findings suggest that Yuri–Tm1 complexes participate in related functions.

Abstract: Mutations of the TMPRSS6 gene are considered the major genetic factors for iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA). Artificial clone libraries containing 17 known mutations of the TMPRSS6 gene were used to develop a high-resolution melting (HRM) assay for the detection of 17 TMPRSS6 gene mutations. The melting temperatures and melting curves were able to distinguish the different genotypes of the 17 TMPRSS6 gene mutations. We used replicate experiments to evaluate the reproducibility of the assay, and the coefficients of variation were in the range 0.0091% to 0.0873%. A total of 145 Chinese patients with IDA were screened with this assay and no TMPRSS6 gene causative mutation was found in any patient. The HRM assay was proved to be rapid, accurate and cost-effective method to identify the TMPRSS6 gene mutations and can be used in the clinical diagnosis of IRIDA.

Abstract: The future application of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) for therapeutic approaches requires the development of xeno-free culture conditions to prevent the potential transmission of animal pathogens or xenobiotic substances to hESC. An important component of the majority of hESC culture systems developed is the requirement for fibroblasts to serve as feeders. For this purpose, several studies have used human foreskin fibroblasts established under xeno-free conditions. In this study we report xeno-free establishment and maintenance of human embryonic fibroblasts (XHEF) and demonstrate their ability to support long-term self-renewal of hESC under xeno-free culture conditions, using a commercially available complete medium. Importantly, our culture conditions allow enzymatic passaging of hESC. In contrast, hESC cultured on human foreskin fibroblasts (XHFF) under the same conditions were poorly maintained and rapidly subject to differentiation. Our study clearly shows that the source of human fibroblasts is essential for long-term xeno-free hESC maintenance.

Abstract: The microtubule motor complex cytoplasmic dynein is known to be involved in multiple processes including endomembrane organization and trafficking, mitosis, and microtubule organization. The majority of studies of cytoplasmic dynein have focused on the form of the motor that is built around the dynein-1 heavy chain. A second isoform, dynein heavy chain-2, and its specifically associated light intermediate chain, LIC3 (D2LIC), are known to be involved in the formation and function of primary cilia. We have used RNAi in human epithelial cells to define the cytoplasmic dynein subunits that function with dynein heavy chain 2 in primary cilia. We identify the dynein light chain Tctex-1 as a key modulator of cilia length control; depletion of Tctex-1 results in longer cilia as defined by both acetylated tubulin labeling of the axoneme and Rab8a labeling of the cilia membrane. Suppression of dynein heavy chain-2 causes concomitant loss of Tctex-1 and this correlates with an increase in cilia length. Compared to individual depletions, double siRNA depletion of DHC2 and Tctex-1 causes an even greater increase in cilia length. Our data show that Tctex-1 is a key regulator of cilia length and most likely functions as part of dynein-2.

Abstract: Several glycolytic enzymes and their isoforms have been found to be important in cell signaling unrelated to glycolysis. The involvement of parafusin (PFUS), a member of the phosphoglucomutase (PGM) superfamily with no phosphoglucomutase activity, in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis has been controversial. This protein was first described in Paramecium tetraurelia, but is widely found. Earlier work showed that parafusin is a secretory vesicle scaffold component with unusual post-translational modifications (cyclic phosphorylation and phosphoglucosylation) coupled to stages in the exocytic process. Using RNAi, we demonstrate that parafusin synthesis can be reversibly blocked, with minor or no effect on other PGM isoforms. PFUS knockdown produces an inhibition of dense core secretory vesicle (DCSV) synthesis leading to an exo− phenotype. Although cell growth is unaffected, vesicle content is not packaged properly and no new DCSVs are formed. We conclude that PFUS and its orthologs are necessary for proper scaffold maturation. Because of this association, parafusin is an important signaling component for regulatory control of the secretory pathway.

Abstract: The inheritance of genetic disease depends on ancestry that must be considered when interpreting genetic association studies and can provide insights when comparing traits in a population. We compared the genetic profiles of African Americans with sickle cell disease to those of Black Africans and Caucasian populations of European descent and found that they are less genetically admixed than other African Americans and have an ancestry similar to Yorubans, Mandenkas and Bantu.

Abstract: Cellular senescence represents a powerful tumor suppressor mechanism to prevent proliferation and invasion of malignant cells. Since tumor cells as well as primary fibroblasts lacking the lysosomal cysteine-type carboxypeptidase cathepsin X exhibit a reduced invasive capacity, we hypothesized that the underlying reason may be the induction of cellular senescence. To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to diminished migration/invasion of cathepsin X-deficient cells, we have analyzed murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from cathepsin X-deficient mice and neonatal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) transfected with siRNAs targeting cathepsin X. Remarkably, both cell types exhibited a flattened and enlarged cell body, a characteristic phenotype of senescent cells. Additional evidence for accelerated senescence was obtained by detection of the common senescence marker β-galactosidase. Further examination revealed increased expression levels of senescence-associated genes such as p16, p21, p53, and caveolin in these cells along with a reduced proliferation rate. The accelerated cellular senescence induced by cathepsin X deficiency was rescued by simultaneous expression of exogenous cathepsin X. Finally, cell cycle analysis confirmed a marked reduction of the synthesis rate and prolongation of the S-phase, while susceptibility to apoptosis of cathepsin X-deficient cells remained unchanged. In conclusion, cathepsin X deficiency leads to accelerated cellular senescence and consequently to diminished cellular proliferation and migration/invasion implying a potential role of cathepsin X in bypassing cellular senescence.

Abstract: TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potential chemotherapeutic agent with high selectivity for malignant cells. Many tumors, however, are resistant to TRAIL cytotoxicity. Although cellular inhibitors of apoptosis 1 and 2 (cIAP-1 and -2) are often over-expressed in cancers, their role in mediating TRAIL resistance remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that TRAIL-induced apoptosis of liver cancer cells is associated with degradation of cIAP-1 and X-linked IAP (XIAP), whereas cIAP-2 remains unchanged. Lower concentrations of TRAIL causing minimal or no apoptosis do not alter cIAP-1 or XIAP protein levels. Silencing of cIAP-1 expression, but not XIAP or cIAP-2, as well as co-treatment with a second mitochondrial activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetic (which results in rapid depletion of cIAP-1), sensitizes the cells to TRAIL. TRAIL-induced loss of cIAP-1 and XIAP requires caspase activity. In particular, caspase 8 knockdown stabilizes both cIAP-1 and XIAP, while caspase 9 knockdown prevents XIAP, but not cIAP-1 degradation. Cell-free experiments confirmed cIAP-1 is a substrate for caspase 8, with likely multiple cleavage sites. These results suggest that TRAIL-mediated apoptosis proceeds through caspase 8-dependent degradation of cIAP-1. Targeted depletion of cIAP-1 by SMAC mimetics in conjunction with TRAIL may be beneficial for the treatment of human hepatobiliary malignancies.

Abstract: Gap-junctional intercellular communication between grafted neural stem cells (NSCs) and host cells seem to be essential for many of the beneficial effects associated with NSC engraftment. Utilizing murine NSCs (mNSCs) grafted into an organotypic ex vivo model system for striatal tissue we examined the prerequisites for formation of gap-junctional couplings between graft and host cells at different time points following implantation. We utilized flow cytometry (to quantify the proportion of connexin (Cx) 26 and 43 expressing cells), immunohistochemistry (for localization of the gap-junctional proteins in graft and host cells), dye-transfer studies with and without pharmacological gap-junctional blockers (assaying the functionality of the formed gap-junctional couplings), and proliferation assays (to estimate the role of gap junctions for NSC well-being) to this end. Immunohistochemical staining and dye-transfer studies revealed that the NSCs already form functional gap junctions prior to engraftment, thereby creating a substrate for subsequent graft and host communication. The expression of Cx43 by grafted NSCs was decreased by neurotrophin-3 overexpression in NSCs and culturing of grafted tissue in serum-free Neurobasal B27 medium. Cx43 expression in NSC-derived cells also changed significantly following engraftment. In host cells the expression of Cx43 peaked following traumatic stimulation and then declined within two weeks, suggesting a window of opportunity for successful host cell rescue by NSC engraftment. Further investigation of the dynamic changes in gap junction expression in graft and host cells and the associated variations in intercellular communication between implanted and endogenous cells might help to understand and control the early positive and negative effects evident following neural stem cell transplantation and thereby optimize the outcome of future clinical NSC transplantation therapies.

Abstract: Efrapeptins (EF), a family of fungal peptides, inhibit proteasomal enzymatic activities and the in vitro and in vivo growth of HT-29 cells. They are also known inhibitors of F1F0-ATPase, a mitochondrial enzyme that functions as an Hsp90 co-chaperone. We have previously shown that treatment of cancer cells with EF results in disruption of the Hsp90:F1F0-ATPase complex and inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone activity. The present study examines the effect of EF on breast cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. As a monotherapy, EF inhibited cell proliferation in vitro with an IC50 value ranging from 6 nM to 3.4 μM. Inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function appeared to be the dominant mechanism of action and the factor determining cellular sensitivity to EF. In vitro inhibition of proteasome became prominent in the absence of adequate levels of Hsp90 and F1F0-ATPase as in the case of the relatively EF-resistant MDA-MB-231 cell line. In vivo, EF inhibited MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 xenograft growth with a maximal inhibition of 60% after administration of 0.15 and 0.3 mg/kg EF, respectively. 2-Deoxyglucose (2DG), a known inhibitor of glycolysis, acted synergistically with EF in vitro and antagonistically in vivo. In vitro, the synergistic effect was attributed to a prolonged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In vivo, the antagonistic effect was ascribed to the downregulation of tumoral and/or stromal F1F0-ATPase by 2DG.

Abstract: Invadopodia are dynamic actin structures at the cell surface that degrade extracellular matrix and act as sites of signal transduction. The biogenesis of invadopodia, including the mechanisms regulating their formation, composition, and turnover is not entirely understood. Here, we demonstrate that antibody ligation of ADAM12, a transmembrane disintegrin and metalloprotease, resulted in the rapid accumulation of invadopodia with extracellular matrix-degrading capacity in epithelial cells expressing the αvβ3 integrin and active c-Src kinase. The induction of invadopodia clusters required an intact c-Src interaction site in the ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain, but was independent of the catalytic activity of ADAM12. Caveolin-1 and transmembrane protease MMP14/MT1-MMP were both present in the ADAM12-induced clusters of invadopodia, and cholesterol depletion prevented their formation, suggesting that lipid-raft microdomains are involved in the process. Importantly, our data demonstrate that ADAM12-mediated ectodomain shedding of epidermal growth factor receptor ligands can occur within these invadopodia. Such localized growth factor signalling offers an interesting novel biological concept highly relevant to the properties of carcinoma cells, which often show upregulated ADAM12 and β3 integrin expression, together with high levels of c-Src kinase activity.

Abstract: The segregation and transmission of the mitochondrial genome in humans are complicated processes but are particularly important for understanding the inheritance and clinical abnormalities of mitochondrial disorders. However, the molecular mechanism of the segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that human mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is required for the segregation of mtDNA in cultured cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of TFAM in HeLa cells resulted in the enlarged mtDNA, as indicated by the assembly of fluorescent signals stained with PicoGreen. Fluorescent in situ hybridization confirmed the enlarged mtDNA and further showed the existence of increased numbers of mitochondria lacking mtDNA signals in TFAM knockdown cells. By complementation analysis, the C-terminal tail of TFAM, which enhances its affinity with DNA, was found to be required for the appropriate distribution of mtDNA. Furthermore, we found that TFAM knockdown induced asymmetric segregation of mtDNA between dividing daughter cells. These results suggest an essential role for human TFAM in symmetric segregation of mtDNA.

Abstract: Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) is a pediatric lysosomal storage disorder characterized by accumulation of autofluorescent storage material and neurodegeneration, which result from mutations in CLN3. The function of CLN3, a lysosomal membrane protein, is currently unknown. We report that CLN3 interacts with cytoskeleton-associated nonmuscle myosin-IIB. Both CLN3 and myosin-IIB are ubiquitously expressed, yet mutations in either produce dramatic consequences in the CNS such as neurodegeneration in JNCL patients and Cln3−/− mouse models, or developmental deficiencies in Myh10−/− mice, respectively. A scratch assay revealed a migration defect associated with Cln3−/− cells. Inhibition of nonmuscle myosin-II with blebbistatin in WT cells resulted in a phenotype that mimics the Cln3−/− migration defect. Moreover, inhibiting lysosome function by treating cells with chloroquine exacerbated the migration defect in Cln3−/−. Cln3−/− cells traversing a transwell filter under gradient trophic factor conditions displayed altered migration, further linking lysosomal function and cell migration. The myosin-IIB distribution in Cln3−/− cells is elongated, indicating a cytoskeleton defect caused by the loss of CLN3. In summary, cells lacking CLN3 have defects that suggest altered myosin-IIB activity, supporting a functional and physical interaction between CLN3 and myosin-IIB. We propose that the migration defect in Cln3−/− results, in part, from the loss of the CLN3–myosin-IIB interaction.

Abstract: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway influences the differentiation of mesenchymal cell lineages in a quantitative and qualitative fashion depending on the dose of β-catenin signaling. Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) is the critical intracellular regulator of β-catenin turnover. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Apc in regulating the differentiation capacity of skeletal progenitor cells, we have knocked down Apc in the murine mesenchymal stem cell-like KS483 cells by stable expression of Apc-specific small interfering RNA. In routine culture, KSFrt-Apcsi cells displayed a mesenchymal-like spindle shape morphology, exhibited markedly decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Apc knockdown resulted in upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin and the BMP/Smad signaling pathways, but osteogenic differentiation was completely inhibited. This effect could be rescued by adding high concentrations of BMP-7 to the differentiation medium. Furthermore, KSFrt-Apcsi cells showed no potential to differentiate into chondrocytes or adipocytes. These results demonstrate that Apc is essential for the proliferation, survival and differentiation of KS483 cells. Apc knockdown blocks the osteogenic differentiation of skeletal progenitor cells, a process that can be overruled by high BMP signaling.

Abstract: The development of in vitro models able to support the long-term viability and function of acinar cells is critical for exploring pancreatic pathophysiology. Despite considerable efforts, no long-term culture models for non-transformed pancreatic acini exist. Our aim was to develop and validate culture conditions for this purpose. An explant outgrowth culture design was established in which mouse pancreatic explants were cultured at the gas–liquid interphase. An enriched culture medium, pH 7.8, was employed to promote the selective outgrowth of acinar cells and to support their differentiated phenotype. After 7 days, the outgrown primary acinar cells were subcultured and maintained up to an additional 7 days as secondary monolayers on tissue culture plastic. Measurements of basal and caerulein-induced amylase secretion, phase-contrast microscopy and immunohistochemical analyses were used to characterize the cultures. Explants retained their pancreatic cytoarchitecture for 2 days in vitro. A triphasic dose response to caerulein was detected in 7-day primary cultures. The maximal rate of secretion was 1.2-fold versus basal (p=0.009) and 1.7-fold versus 1pM caerulein (p=0.014). In secondary cultures the response was biphasic with maximal rates of secretion being 1.9-fold in 3- to 4-day cultures at 0.01nM (p=0.049) and 2-fold in 6- to 7-day cultures at 0.1nM (p=0.003). The present culture model provides a means to obtain functionally competent normal mouse acinar cells for long-term in vitro experimentation.

Abstract: Obesity is associated with adipose tissue remodeling, characterized by macrophage accumulation, adipocyte hypertrophy, and apoptosis. We previously reported that macrophage-conditioned medium (MacCM) protects preadipocytes from apoptosis, due to serum withdrawal, in a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-dependent manner. We have now investigated the role of intracellular signaling pathways, activated in response to MacCM versus PDGF, in promoting preadipocyte survival. Exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to J774A.1-MacCM or PDGF strongly stimulated Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation from initially undetectable levels. Inhibition of the upstream regulators of Akt or ERK1/2, i.e. phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K; using wortmannin or LY294002) or MEK1/2 (using UO126 or PD98509), abrogated the respective phosphorylation responses, and significantly impaired pro-survival activity. J774A.1-MacCM increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by 3.4-fold, and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) significantly inhibited pro-survival signaling and preadipocyte survival in response to J774A.1-MacCM. Serum withdrawal itself also increased ROS levels (2.1-fold), and the associated cell death was attenuated by DPI or NAC. In summary, J774A.1-MacCM-dependent 3T3-L1 preadipocyte survival requires the Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Furthermore, ROS generation by J774A.1-MacCM is required for Akt and ERK1/2 signaling to promote 3T3-L1 preadipocyte survival. These data suggest potential mechanisms by which macrophages may alter preadipocyte fate.

Abstract: Tetracycline antibiotics, including doxycycli\e (DOX), have been used to treat bone resorptive diseases, partially because of their activity to suppress osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL). However, their precise inhibitory mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, the present study examined the effect of Dox on osteoclastogenesis signaling induced by RANKL, both in vitro and in vivo. Although Dox inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and down-modulated the mRNA expression of functional osteoclast markers, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K, Dox neither affected RANKL-induced MAPKs phosphorylation nor NFATc1 gene expression in RAW264.7 murine monocytic cells. Gelatin zymography and Western blot analyses showed that Dox down-regulated the enzyme activity of RANKL-induced MMP-9, but without affecting its protein expression. Furthermore, MMP-9 enzyme inhibitor also attenuated both RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and up-regulation of TRAP and cathepsin K mRNA expression, indicating that MMP-9 enzyme action is engaged in the promotion of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Finally, Dox treatment abrogated RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and TRAP activity in mouse calvaria along with the suppression of MMP9 enzyme activity, again without affecting the expression of MMP9 protein. These findings suggested that Dox inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by its inhibitory effect on MMP-9 enzyme activity independent of the MAPK-NFATc1 signaling cascade.

Abstract: Cytochrome P4501A2 (Cyp1a2) is important in the development of uroporphyria in mice, a model of porphyria cutanea tarda in humans. Heretofore, mice homozygous for the Cyp1a2−/− mutation do not develop uroporphyria with treatment regimens that result in uroporphyria in wild-type mice. Here we report uroporphyria development in Cyp1a2−/− mice additionally null for both alleles of the hemochromatosis (Hfe) gene and heterozygous for deletion of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (Urod) gene (genotype: Cyp1a2−/−;Hfe−/−;Urod+/−), demonstrating that upon adding porphyria-predisposing genetic manipulations, Cyp1a2 is not essential. Cyp1a2−/−;Hfe−/−;Urod+/− mice were treated with various combinations of an iron-enriched diet, parenteral iron-dextran, drinking water containing δ-aminolevulinic acid and intraperitoneal Aroclor 1254 (a polychlorinated biphenyl mixture) and analyzed for uroporphyrin accumulation. Animals fed an iron-enriched diet alone did not develop uroporphyria but uroporphyria developed with all treatments that included iron supplementation and δ-aminolevulinic acid, even with a regimen without Aroclor 1254. Hepatic porphyrin levels correlated with low UROD activity and high levels of an inhibitor of UROD but marked variability in the magnitude of the porphyric response was present in all treatment groups. Gene expression profiling revealed no major differences between genetically identical triple cross mice exhibiting high and low magnitude porphyric responses from iron-enriched diet and iron-dextran supplementation, and δ-aminolevulinic acid. Even though the variation in porphyric response did not parallel the hepatic iron concentration, the results are compatible with the presence of a Cyp1a2-independent, iron-dependent pathway for the generation of uroporphomethene, the UROD inhibitor required for the expression of uroporphyria in mice and PCT in humans.

Abstract: An important proof of principle has been achieved with the development of an in vitro T-cell differentiation assay based on the coculture of hematopoietic progenitors with the OP9-Delta1 stromal cell line. The original murine T cell differentiation assay has since been adapted for human T-cell differentiation, however with lower efficiency. The choice of both medium and cytokines is crucial in this assay, therefore our work has been focused on these two factors. The use of freshly reconstituted medium, the optimization of interleukine-7 (IL-7) concentration, and the addition of stem cell factor (SCF) have allowed to improve the proliferation of progenitors and T-cell precursors as well as the yield of double positive CD4+CD8+ T cells, and mature γδ and αβ T cells. These optimizations make the OP9-Delta1 system sensitive enough to perform both quantitative and qualitative assays with various type of progenitors, including those transduced by a retroviral vector. The improved OP9-Delta1 assay therefore constitutes an extremely useful test for basic research purposes and for translational medicine.

Abstract: Exon 6B from the chicken β-tropomyosin pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced during myogenic differentiation. Exon 6B is excluded in mRNA from myoblasts and included in mRNA from myotubes. We investigated the regulation of exon 6B inclusion ex vivo in a quail myogenic cell line, which behaves as myoblasts in undifferentiated state and as myotubes after differentiation. We show that the β-tropomyosin exon 6B is a novel target of CUG-BP and ETR-3-like factor (CELF). Overexpression of CELF proteins in myoblasts activates splicing of exon 6B. Using a dominant-negative form of CELF4, we demonstrate that CELF proteins are involved in switching splicing from exon 6A towards exon 6B inclusion during myogenic differentiation. We also found that polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) is required for splicing repression of exon 6B in myoblasts. CELF and PTB proteins exhibit antagonistic properties toward inclusion of exon 6B during myogenic differentiation. Our results suggest that a change in the protein level of CUGBP1 and PTB proteins, associated with a distinct pattern of PTB during the transition from myoblasts to myotubes is one of the parameters involved in regulating splicing of exon 6B during myogenesis.

Abstract: Background
The expression of the two types of ferritin subunits, the H-subunit and L-subunit, has been shown to be differentially regulated by cytokines. The primary aim of the present study was to quantitatively measure the expression of the H-subunit and L-subunit of ferritin in bone marrow macrophages and cells of the erythron in patients with chronic T-helper cell type-1 immune stimulation.
Methods
The expression of the H-subunit and L-subunit of ferritin in bone marrow macrophages and cells of the erythron was quantitatively evaluated by post-embedding immunolocalisation with immunogold transmission electron microscopy.
Results
The present study showed up-regulation of the H-subunit of ferritin in the bone marrow macrophage in patients with pronounced cellular immune activation (94.7±37.3counts/μm2; n=31 vs 72.4±34.0counts/μm2; n=13, p-value=0.037).
Conclusion
This supports a possible role for H-subunit rich ferritins in the hypoferraemia of chronic disease.

Abstract: Dimeric intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) has been known to more efficiently mediate cell adhesion than monomeric ICAM-1. Here, we found that truncation of the intracellular domain of ICAM-1 significantly enhances surface dimerization based on the two criteria: 1) the binding degree of monomer-specific antibody CA-7 and 2) the ratio of dimer/monomer when a mutation (L42→C42) was introduced in the interface of domain 1. Mutation analysis revealed that the positively charged amino acids, including very membrane-proximal 505R, are essential for maintaining the structural transition between the monomer and dimer. Despite a strong dimer presentation, the ICAM-1 mutants lacking an intracellular domain (IC1ΔCTD) or containing R to A substitution in position 505 (505R/A) supported a lower degree of cell adhesion than did wild-type ICAM-1. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the native structure of surface ICAM-1 is not a dimer, but is an intermediate monomer–dimer equilibrium structure by which the effectiveness of ICAM-1 can be fully achieved.

Abstract: Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (MIM #604498) (CAMT) is a rare inherited disease presenting as severe thrombocytopenia in infancy. Untreated, many CAMT patients develop aplastic anemia within the first decade of life; the only effective treatment of CAMT is bone marrow transplantation. CAMT is the result of the presence of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor-encoding gene, MPL. We report here the identification and characterization of a founder mutation in MPL in the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population. This mutation, termed c.79+2T>A, is a T to A transversion in the invariant second base of the intron 1 donor splice site. Analysis of a random sample of 2018 individuals of AJ descent revealed a carrier frequency of approximately 1 in 75. Genotyping of six loci adjacent to the MPL gene in the proband and in the 27 individuals identified as carriers of the c.79+2T>A mutation revealed that the presence of this mutation in the AJ population is due to a single founder. The observed carrier frequency predicts an incidence of CAMT in the AJ population of approximately 1 in 22,500 pregnancies. The identification of this mutation will enable population carrier testing and will facilitate the identification and treatment of individuals homozygous for this mutation.

Abstract: The hereditary stomatocytoses are a group of heterogeneous conditions associated with chronic red cell hemolysis for which the causative genetic mutations are not known. We investigated 137 members of a large Canadian kindred with phenotypic findings consistent with hereditary xerocytosis, one of the most common stomatocytosis syndromes. The objectives of this study were to characterize the clinical hallmarks of the hemolytic process, and to define the chromosomal region carrying the disease locus. The mode of inheritance was autosomal dominant. Affected family members had a well-compensated hemolysis, associated with an elevated MCHC, decreased osmotic fragility, decreased haptoglobin, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Cholelithiasis and progressive iron loading were common, despite normal hemoglobin levels. Quantitative erythrocyte morphologic evaluation revealed increased schistocytes, target cells, reticulocytes, and eccentrocytes in affected individuals; stomatocytes were not increased. Genetic linkage analysis confirmed the localization of the disease phenotype to chromosome 16q, and refined the candidate region to 16q24.2-16qter, a 2.4 million base pair interval containing 51 known or predicted genes.

Abstract: Aims
Activin A and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) belong to the same family of growth and differentiation factors that modulate vascular lesion formation in distinct ways, which we wish to understand mechanistically.
Methods and results
We investigated the expression of cell-surface receptors and activation of Smads in human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and demonstrated that activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ALK-1), ALK-4, ALK-5 and endoglin are expressed in human SMCs. As expected, TGF-β1 activates Smad1 and Smad2 in these cells. Interestingly, activin A also induces phosphorylation of both Smads, which has not been reported for Smad1 before. Transcriptome analyses of activin A and TGF-β1 treated SMCs with subsequent Gene-Set Enrichment Analyses revealed that many downstream gene networks are induced by both factors. However, the effect of activin A on expression kinetics of individual genes is less pronounced than for TGF-β1, which is explained by a more rapid dephosphorylation of Smads and p38-MAPK in response to activin A. Substantial differences in expression of fibronectin, alpha-V integrin and total extracellular collagen synthesis were observed.
Conclusions
Genome-wide mRNA expression analyses clarify the distinct modulation of vascular lesion formation by activin A and TGF-β1, most significantly because activin A is non-fibrotic.

Abstract: Cardiac fibroblasts are reported to be relatively resistant to stress stimuli compared to cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts of non-cardiac origin. However, the mechanisms that facilitate their survival under conditions of stress remain unclear. We explored the possibility that NF-κB protects cardiac fibroblasts from hypoxia-induced cell death. Further, we examined the expression of the antiapoptotic cIAP-2 and Bcl-2 in hypoxic cardiac fibroblasts, and their possible regulation by NF-κB. Phase contrast microscopy and propidium iodide staining revealed that cardiac fibroblasts are more resistant than pulmonary fibroblasts to hypoxia. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay showed that hypoxia activates NF-κB in cardiac fibroblasts. Supershift assay indicated that the active NF-κB complex is a p65/p50 heterodimer. An I-κB-super-repressor was constructed that prevented NF-κB activation and compromised cell viability under hypoxic but not normoxic conditions. Similar results were obtained with Bay 11-7085, an inhibitor of NF-κB. Western blot analysis showed constitutive levels of Bcl-2 and hypoxic induction of cIAP-2 in these cells. NF-κB inhibition reduced cIAP-2 but not Bcl-2 levels in hypoxic cardiac fibroblasts. The results show for the first time that NF-κB is an important effector of survival in cardiac fibroblasts under hypoxic stress and that regulation of cIAP-2 expression may contribute to its pro-survival role.

Abstract: We report here the cleavage of the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway scaffold protein, JNK Interacting Protein-1 (JIP1), by caspases during both Tumour Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) and staurosporine-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. During the initiation of apoptosis, maximal JNK activation is observed when JIP1 is intact, whereas cleavage of JIP1 correlates with JNK inactivation and progression of apoptosis. JIP1 is cleaved by caspase-3 at two sites, leading to disassembly of the JIP1/JNK complex. Inhibition of JIP1 cleavage by the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD.fmk inhibits this disassembly, and is accompanied by sustained JNK activation. These data suggest that TRAIL and staurosporine induce JNK activation in a caspase-3-independent manner and that caspase-3-mediated JIP1 cleavage plays a role in JNK inactivation via scaffold disassembly during the execution phase of apoptosis. Caspase-mediated cleavage of JIP scaffold proteins may therefore represent an important mechanism for modulation of JNK signalling during apoptotic cell death.

Abstract: Activin induces the formation of definitive endoderm from mouse ES cells dependent on active fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling. Here we report that Fgf4 is dispensable for activin A-induced differentiation of mouse ES cells into endoderm. We find that Fgf4−/− cells readily differentiate into definitive endoderm without exogenous administration of Fgf4. Additionally, we investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of Fgf receptor (FGFR) isoform distribution in activin A-treated ES cell cultures and find that FGFR(III)c isoforms are expressed in DE as well as non-DE populations, whereas FGFR2(III)b and FGFR4 are found specifically enriched in the DE fraction. Ligands that preferentially activate the FGFR(III)c isoforms induce mesendoderm markers T and Gsc, but reduce expression of the DE marker Sox17 in activin-induced EpCAM+ cells. In contrast, ligands specifically activating FGFR(III)b isoforms have no effect on either population. Activation of FGFR(III)c isoforms results in a strong mitogenic effect on activin A-induced ES cell progeny early in the differentiation period whereas activation of FGFR(III)b isoforms has only a moderate mitogenic effect confined to the late differentiation period. We conclude that FGFR(III)c-isoform activation selectively drives the differentiation of mES cells toward mesendoderm and that Fgf4 is dispensable for the differentiation into definitive endoderm.

Abstract: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) constitute a heterogeneous group of clonal hematological diseases characterized by refractory cytopenia(s). MDS patients show increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) which is a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine. The aim of this work is to examine the presence of -308A/G TNFα variants and to analyze whether it is associated with clinical parameters in a cohort of 101 Argentinean de novo MDS patients. The A/A+A/G genotype at TNFα -308 was overrepresented 2-fold in our population (p=0.0499, odds ratio—OR: 2.107) and these differences were more evident in RA-FAB subtype (p=0.0424, OR: 2.502). The presence of the high expressing -308A allele was associated with lower hemoglobin level (8.3 vs 9.9g/dL; p=0.0206), reduced platelet counts (89,000 vs 130,000/μL; p=0.0381) and younger age (59 vs 68years; p=0.0122) at diagnosis. Also, these patients showed 3.8-fold higher risk of transfusion requirement (76% vs 46%, p=0.0105) during the follow up. In conclusion, the presence of an inherited -308A TNFα, which increases its transcription level, was associated with the MDS phenotype in our cohort of Argentine MDS patients. Also, an overexpression of TNFα may promote an underlying proinflammatory state that cooperates with intrinsic defects within MDS progenitors to increase the severity of certain phenotypic features of the disease.

Abstract: The number of erythroblasts generated ex-vivo under human-erythroid massive-amplification conditions by mononuclear cells from one unit of adult blood (~1010) are insufficient for transfusion (~1012 red cells), emphasizing the need for studies to characterize cellular interactions during culture to increase erythroblast production. To identify the cell populations which generate erythroblasts under human-erythroid-massive-amplification conditions and the factors that limit proliferation, day 10 non-erythroblasts and immature- and mature-erythroblasts were separated by sorting, labelled with carboxyfluorescein-diacetate-succinimidyl-ester and re-cultured either under these conditions (for proliferation, maturation and/or apoptosis/autophagy determinations) or in semisolid media (for progenitor cell determination). Non-erythroblasts contained 54% of the progenitor cells but did not grow under human-erythroid-massive-amplification conditions. Immature-erythroblasts contained 25% of the progenitor cells and generated erythroblasts under human-erythroid-massive-amplification conditions (FI at 48h=2.57±1.15). Mature-erythroblasts did not generate colonies and died in human-erythroid-massive-amplification conditions. In sequential sorting/re-culture experiments, immature-erythroblasts retained the ability to generate erythroblasts for 6days and generated 2−5-fold more cells than the corresponding unfractionated population, suggesting that mature-erythroblasts may limit erythroblast expansion. In co-cultures of carboxyfluorescein-diacetate-succinimidyl-ester-labelled-immature-erythroblasts with mature-erythroblasts at increasing ratios, cell numbers did not increase and proliferation, maturation and apoptotic rates were unchanged. However, Acridine Orange staining (a marker for autophagic death) increased from ~3.2% in cultures with immature-erythroblasts alone to 14−22% in cultures of mature-erythroblasts with and without immature-erythroblasts. In conclusion, these data identify immature-erythroblasts as the cells that generate additional erythroblasts in human-erythroid-massive-amplification cultures and autophagy as the leading cause of death limiting the final cellular output of these cultures.

Abstract: Cartilage defects have limited capacity for repair and are often replaced by fibrocartilage with inferior mechanical properties. To overcome the limitations of artificial joint replacement, high-throughput screens (HTS) could be developed to identify molecules that stimulate differentiation and/or proliferation of articular cartilage for drug therapy or tissue engineering. Currently embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into articular cartilage by forming aggregates (embryoid body (EB), pellet, micromass), which are difficult to image. We present a novel, single-step method of generating murine ESC-derived chondrocytes in monolayer cultures under chemically defined conditions. Mesoderm induction was achieved in cultures supplemented with BMP4, activin A, or Wnt3a. Prolonged culture with sustained activin A, TGFβ3, or BMP4 supplementation led to robust chondrogenic induction. A short pulse of activin A or BMP4 also induced chondrogenesis efficiently while Wnt3a acted as a later inducer. Long-term supplementation with activin A or with activin A followed by TGFβ3 promoted articular cartilage formation. Thus, we devised a serum-free (SF) culture system to generate ESC-derived chondrocytes without the establishment of 3D cultures or the aid of cell sorting. Cultures were governed by the same signaling pathways as 3D ESC differentiation systems and limb bud mesenchyme or articular cartilage explant cultures.

Abstract: Abscission marks the completion of cell division and its failure is associated with delayed cytokinesis and even tetraploidization. Aberrant abscission and consequential ploidy changes can underlie various diseases including cancer. Midbody, a transient structure formed in the intercellular bridge during telophase, contains several proteins including Aurora kinase B (AURKB), which participate in abscission. We report here an unexpected expression pattern and function of the transcription repressor protein CGG triplet repeat-binding protein 1 (CGGBP1), in normal human fibroblasts. We show that CGGBP1, a chromatin-associated protein, trans-localizes to spindle midzone and midbodies in a manner similar to that of AURKB. CGGBP1 depletion resulted in a cell cycle block at G2, characterized by failure of cells to undergo mitosis and also reduced entry into S phase. Consistent with its presence in the midbodies, live microscopy showed that CGGBP1 deficiency caused mitotic failure at abscission resulting in tetraploidy, which could be rescued by CGGBP1 overexpression. These results show that CGGBP1 is a bona fide midbody protein required for normal abscission and mitosis in general.

Abstract: Functional gap junction channels composed of certain connexin proteins are essential for the function of the cochlea. Homozygous deficiency in the Gjb2 (mice) or GJB2 (human) gene coding for connexin26 (Cx26) in the cochlea leads to hearing impairment in mice and humans, respectively. Here we have studied the functional equivalence of Cx26 and connexin32 (Cx32) isoforms in the cochlea. We analyzed a conditional mouse mutant in which the Gjb2 coding DNA was exchanged by LacZ DNA coding for the reporter protein beta-galactosidase. This allowed us to follow the unrestricted and cell type specific expression of Gjb2 promoter activity. After inner ear specific, Otogelin-Cre recombinase mediated deletion of the loxP-site-flanked LacZ coding DNA, transcription of the Gjb1 gene, coding for Cx32 was activated by the Gjb2 promoter. Interbreeding of these mice with conditional Gjb2 null mice resulted in animals in which Cx32 instead of Cx26 protein is expressed in the non-sensory epithelial network of the cochlea. When we analyzed the auditory function in these mice, we found that the expression of Cx32 protein is sufficient to support hearing in the absence of Cx26. Thus Cx32 can functionally replace Cx26 in the mouse cochlea resulting in almost normal hearing.

Abstract: Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) induces neuronal differentiation and promotes the survival of various neuronal cell types by binding to a receptor complex formed by CNTF receptor α (CNTFRα), gp130, and the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor (LIFR). The CD loop-D helix region of CNTF has been suggested to be important for the cytokine interaction with LIFR. We designed a peptide, termed cintrofin, that encompasses this region. Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated that cintrofin bound to LIFR and gp130, but not to CNTFRα, with apparent KD values of 35nM and 1.1nM, respectively. Cintrofin promoted the survival of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), in which cell death was induced either by potassium withdrawal or H2O2 treatment. Cintrofin induced neurite outgrowth from CGNs, and this effect was inhibited by specific antibodies against both gp130 and LIFR, indicating that these receptors are involved in the effects of cintrofin. The C-terminal part of the peptide, corresponding to the D helix region of CNTF, was shown to be essential for the neuritogenic action of the peptide. CNTF and LIF induced neurite outgrowth in CGNs plated on laminin-coated slides. On uncoated slides, CNTF and LIF had no neuritogenic effect but were able to inhibit cintrofin-induced neuronal differentiation, indicating that cintrofin and cytokines compete for the same receptors. In addition, cintrofin induced the phosphorylation of STAT3, Akt, and ERK, indicating that it exerts cell signaling properties similar to those induced by CNTF and may be a valuable survival agent with possible therapeutic potential.

Abstract: JAK2V617F mutation has been reported in 90% of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and about 50% of patients with essential thromobocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Recently, acquired mutations in the transmembrane–juxtamembrane region of MPL (MPLW515 mutations) have been reported in approximately 5% of JAK2V617F-negative PMF and about 1% of all cases of ET. MPL is the receptor for thrombopoietin that regulates the production of platelets by bone marrow. It is likely that some mutations more closely related to ET in MPL exon10 may have been missed by current assays. We inferred that there might be other mutations in MPL exon10 for MPN patients in addition to MPLW515 mutations. To investigate its mutation types and prevalence in Chinese patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), we performed mutation detection on MPL exon10 in 103 JAK2V617F-negative MPN patients by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) combined with sequencing. As a result, one previously unrecognized MPL mutation (12-bp in-frame insertion) was identified in one patient with ET in addition to an MPLW515K mutation identified in one PMF patient. This confirms our hypothesis that BCR/ABL negative and JAK2V617F-negative MPN patients have other mutations besides W515 mutation in MPL exon10 and mutations other than single nucleotide exchange also exist. In addition, MPL mutation was associated with Chinese MPN patients.

Abstract: During the past three decades, electrophysiological studies revealed that human red blood cell membrane is endowed with a large variety of ion channels. The physiological role of these channels, if any, remains unclear; they do not participate in red cell homeostasis which is rather based on the almost total absence of cationic permeability and minute anionic conductance. They seem to be inactive in the “resting cell.” However, when activated experimentally, ion channels can lead to a very high single cell conductance and potentially induce disorders, with the major risks of fast dehydration and dissipation of gradients. Could there be physiological conditions under which the red cell needs to activate these high conductances, or are ion channels relics of a function lost in anucleated cells? It has been demonstrated that they play a key role in diseases such as sickle cell anemia or malaria. This short overview of ion channels identified to-date in the human red cell membrane is an attempt to propose a dynamic role for these channels in circulating cells in health and disease.

Abstract: The therapeutic potential of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has long been appreciated, and the recent FDA approval of hESC derivatives for cell-based therapy encourages the clinical application of hESCs. Here, using CHA3-hESCs with normal and abnormal karyotypes, we report the importance of maintaining normal chromosomes during in vitro culture and the differentiation of hESCs for minimization of posttransplantation complications. We found that undifferentiated CHA3-hESCs with trisomy chromosome 12 undergo abnormal cell division with multiple spindles in comparison to the bipolar cell division of the karyotypically normal CHA3-hESCs. Transplanted karyotypically abnormal CHA3-hESC derivatives formed a tumor-like tissue 6weeks after transplantation in two out of seven mice tested. Our results demonstrate that the preservation of normal chromosomes is indispensable for maintaining the true properties of hESCs in vitro and abolishing adverse effects posttransplantation. Thus, the development of optimized techniques for stabilizing the chromosome state during in vitro hESC culture is a prerequisite for the therapeutic application of hESCs.

Abstract: The Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase regulates numerous cellular processes. Rsp5 is mainly localized to the cytoplasm but nuclear localization was also reported. A potential nuclear export signal was tested for activity by using a GFP2 reporter. The 687-LIGGIAEIDI-696 sequence located in the Hect domain was identified as a nuclear export signal active in a Crm1-dependent manner, and its importance for the localization of Rsp5 was documented by using fluorescence microscopy and a lacZ-based reporter system. Analysis of the cellular location of other Rsp5 fragments fused with GFP2 indicated two independent potential nuclear localization signals, both located in the Hect domain. We also uncovered Rsp5 fragments that are important to targeting/tethering Rsp5 to various regions in the cytoplasm. The presented data indicate that Rsp5 ligase is a shuttling protein whose distribution within the cytoplasm and partitioning between cytoplasmic and nuclear locations is determined by a balance between the actions of several targeting sequences and domains.

Accumulation of distinct prelamin A variants in human diploid fibroblasts differentially affects cell homeostasis,

Abstract: Lamin A is a component of the nuclear lamina that plays a major role in the structural organization and function of the nucleus. Lamin A is synthesized as a prelamin A precursor which undergoes four sequential post-translational modifications to generate mature lamin A. Significantly, a large number of point mutations in the LMNA gene cause a range of distinct human disorders collectively known as laminopathies. The mechanisms by which mutations in lamin A affect cell function and cause disease are unclear. Interestingly, recent studies have suggested that alterations in the normal lamin A pathway can contribute to cellular dysfunction. Specifically, we and others have shown, at the cellular level, that in the absence of mutations or altered splicing events, increased expression of wild-type prelamin A results in a growth defective phenotype that resembles that of cells expressing the mutant form of lamin A, termed progerin, associated with Hutchinson–Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS). Remarkably, the phenotypes of cells expressing elevated levels of wild-type prelamin A can be reversed by either treatment with farnesyltransferase inhibitors or overexpression of ZMPSTE24, a critical prelamin A processing enzyme, suggesting that minor increases in the steady-state levels of one or more prelamin A intermediates is sufficient to induce cellular toxicity. Here, to investigate the molecular basis of the lamin A pathway toxicity, we characterized the phenotypic changes occurring in cells expressing distinct prelamin A variants mimicking specific prelamin A processing intermediates. This analysis demonstrates that distinct prelamin A variants differentially affect cell growth, nuclear membrane morphology, nuclear distribution of lamin A and the fundamental process of transcription. Expression of prelamin A variants that are constitutively farnesylated induced the formation of lamin A aggregates and dramatic changes in nuclear membrane morphology, which led to reduced levels of the basal transcription factor TATA-binding protein (TBP) and global transcription, and severely limited cell growth. Expression of a prelamin A variant that cannot be farnesylated, although did not appreciably influence cell growth, resulted in the formation of lamin A nucleoplasmic foci and caused, in a minor subpopulation of cells, changes in nuclear morphology that were accompanied by reduced levels of TBP and transcription. In contrast, expression of mature lamin A did not affect any of these parameters. These data demonstrate that accumulation of any partially processed prelamin A protein alters cellular homeostasis to some degree, even though the most dramatic effects are caused by variants with a permanently farnesylated carboxyl-terminal tail.

Abstract: Mutations of the TMPRSS6 gene, encoding the serine protease matriptase-2, lead to iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia. Matriptase-2 is a potent negative regulator of hepcidin. Based on in vitro data, it has recently been proposed that matriptase-2 decreases hepcidin synthesis by cleaving membrane hemojuvelin, a key protein of the hepcidin-regulatory pathway. However, in vivo evidence for this mechanism of action of matriptase-2 is lacking. To investigate the hemojuvelin–matriptase-2 interaction in vivo, an immunoblot assay for liver membrane hemojuvelin was optimized using hemojuvelin-mutant mice as a negative control. In wild-type mice, two hemojuvelin-specific bands of 35kDa and 20kDa were detected in mouse liver membrane fraction under reducing conditions; under non-reducing conditions, a single band of approximately 50kDa was seen. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment confirmed binding of the detected protein to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, indicating that the major form of mouse liver membrane hemojuvelin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-bound heterodimer. Unexpectedly, comparison of liver homogenates from Tmprss6+/+ and Tmprss6−/− mice revealed significantly decreased, rather than increased, hemojuvelin heterodimer content in Tmprss6−/− mice. These data do not provide direct support for the concept that matriptase-2 cleaves membrane hemojuvelin and may indicate that, in vivo, the role of matriptase-2 in the regulation of hepcidin gene expression is more complex.

Abstract: Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is overexpressed in solid tumors, being associated with several pro-tumoral responses including primary growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Expression of PAR-1 in human leukemic cell lines is reported but the status of its expression in human leukemic patients is currently unknown. In this study we evaluated the expression pattern of PAR-1 in patients with the four main types of leukemia – chronic lymphocytic leukemia subtype B (B-CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtype B (B-ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Flow cytometry analyses show that lymphocytes from B-CLL patients express this receptor at similar levels to healthy individuals. On the other hand, it was observed a significant increase in PAR-1 expression in B-ALL lymphocytes as compared to B-CLL and healthy donors. Flow cytometric and real-time PCR demonstrated a significant increase in PAR-1 expression in granulocytes from CML patients in blast phase (CML-BP) but not in chronic phase (CML-CP) as compared to healthy donors. Finally, a significant increase in PAR-1 expression has been also observed in blasts from AML (subtypes M4 and M5) patients, as compared to monocytes or granulocytes from healthy donors. We conclude that PAR-1 might play an important biological role in aggressive leukemias and might offer additional strategies for the development of new therapies.

Abstract: Yeast Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase is involved in several cellular processes, including endocytosis. Actin patches are sites of endocytosis, a process involving actin assembly and disassembly. Here we show Rsp5 localization in cortical patches and demonstrate its involvement in actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics. We found that the Rsp5-F1-GFP2 N-terminal fragment and full length GFP-Rsp5 were recruited to peripheral patches that temporarily co-localized with Abp1-mCherry, a marker of actin patches. Actin cytoskeleton organization was defective in a strain lacking RSP5 or overexpressing RSP5, and this phenotype was accompanied by morphological abnormalities. Overexpression of RSP5 caused hypersensitivity of cells to Latrunculin A, an actin-depolymerizing drug and was toxic to cells lacking Las17, an activator of actin nucleation. Moreover, Rsp5 was required for efficient actin polymerization in a whole cell extract based in vitro system. Rsp5 interacted with Las17 and Las17-binding proteins, Lsb1 and Lsb2, in a GST-Rsp5-WW2/3 pull down assay. Rsp5 ubiquitinated Lsb1-HA and Lsb2-HA without directing them for degradation. Overexpression of RSP5 increased the cellular level of HA-Las17 in wild type and in lsb1Δ lsb2Δ strains in which the basal level of Las17 was already elevated. This increase was prevented in a strain devoid of Las17-binding protein Sla1 which is also a target of Rsp5 ubiquitination. Thus, Rsp5 together with Lsb1, Lsb2 and Sla1 regulate the level of Las17, an important activator of actin polymerization.

Abstract: Epidemiological evidence indicates that diets high in fruits and vegetables provide a measure of cancer chemoprevention due to phytochemical constituents. Natural products are a rich source of cancer chemotherapy drugs, and primarily target rapidly cycling tumor cells. Increasing evidence indicates that many cancers contain small populations of resistant, stem-like cells that have the capacity to regenerate tumors following chemotherapy and radiation, and have been linked to the initiation of metastases. Our goal is to discover natural product-based clinical or dietary interventions that selectively target cancer stem cells, inducing differentiation. We adapted an alkaline phosphatase (AP) stain to assay plant extracts for the capacity to induce differentiation in embryonic stem (ES) cells. AP is a characteristic marker of undifferentiated ES cells, and this represents a novel approach to screening medicinal plant extracts. Following a survey of approximately 100 fractions obtained from 12 species of ethnomedically utilized plants, we found fractions from 3 species that induced differentiation, decreasing AP and transcript levels of pluripotency markers (Nanog, Oct-4, Rex-1). These fractions affected proliferation of murine ES, and human embryonal, prostate, and breast carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Several phytochemical constituents were isolated; the antioxidant phytochemicals ellagic acid and gallic acid were shown to affect viability of cultured breast carcinoma cells.

Abstract: Background
p.C282Y mutation and rare variants in the HFE gene have been associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). HH is also caused by mutations in other genes, such as the hemojuvelin (HJV), hepcidin (HAMP), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and ferroportin (SLC40A1). The low rate homozygous p.C282Y mutation in Brazil is suggestive that mutations in non-HFE genes may be linked to HH phenotype.
Aim
To screen exon-by-exon DNA sequences of HFE, HJV, HAMP, TFR2 and SLC40A1 genes to characterize the molecular basis of HH in a sample of the Brazilian population.
Materials and methods
Fifty-one patients with primary iron overload (transferrin saturation ≥50% in females and ≥60% in males) were selected. Subsequent bidirectional DNA sequencing of HFE, HJV, HAMP, TFR2 and SLC40A1 exons was performed.
Results
Thirty-seven (72.5%) out of the 51 patients presented at least one HFE mutation. The most frequent genotype associated with HH was the homozygous p.C282Y mutation (n=11, 21.6%). In addition, heterozygous HFE p.S65C mutation was found in combination with p.H63D in two patients and homozygous HFE p.H63D was found in two patients as well. Sequencing in the HJV and HAMP genes revealed HJV p.E302K, HJV p.A310G, HJV p.G320V and HAMP p.R59G alterations. Molecular and clinical diagnosis of juvenile hemochromatosis (homozygous form for the HJV p.G320V) was described for the first time in Brazil. Three TFR2 polymorphisms (p.A75V, p.A617A and p.R752H) and six SLC40A1 polymorphisms (rs13008848, rs11568351, rs11568345, rs11568344, rs2304704, rs11568346) and the novel mutation SLC40A1 p.G204S were also found.
Conclusions
The HFE p.C282Y in homozygosity or in heterozygosity with p.H63D was the most frequent mutation associated with HH in this sample. The HJV p.E302K and HAMP p.R59G variants, and the novel SLC40A1 p.G204S mutation may also be linked to primary iron overload but their role in the pathophysiology of HH remain to be elucidated.

Passive transport pathways for Ca2+ and Co2+ in human red blood cells. 57Co2+ as a tracer for Ca2+ influx,

Abstract: The passive transport of calcium and cobalt and their interference were studied in human red cells using 45Ca and 57Co as tracers. In ATP-depleted cells, with the ATP concentration reduced to about 1μM, the progress curve for 45Ca uptake at 1mM rapidly levels off with time, consistent with a residual Ca-pump activity building up at increasing [CaT]c to reach at [CaT]c about 5μmol(lcells)−1 a maximal pump rate that nearly countermands the passive Ca influx, resulting in a linear net uptake at a low level. In ATP-depleted cells treated with vanadate, supposed to cause Ca-pump arrest, a residual pump activity is still present at high [CaT]c. Moreover, vanadate markedly increases the passive Ca2+ influx. The residual Ca-pump activity in ATP-depleted cells is fuelled by breakdown of the large 2,3-DPG pool, rate-limited by the sustainable ATP-turnover at about 40–50μmol(lcells)−1h−1. The apparent Ca2+ affinity of the Ca-pump appears to be markedly reduced compared to fed cells. The 2,3-DPG breakdown can be prevented by inhibition of the 2,3-DPG phosphatase by tetrathionate, and under these conditions the 45Ca uptake is markedly increased and linear with time, with the unidirectional Ca influx at 1mM Ca2+ estimated at 50–60μmol(lcells)−1h−1. The Ca influx increases with the extracellular Ca2+ concentration with a saturating component, with K½(Ca) about 0.3mM, plus a non-saturating component. From 45Ca-loaded, ATP-depleted cells the residual Ca-pump can also be detected as a vanadate- and tetrathionate-sensitive efflux. The 45Ca efflux is markedly accelerated by external Ca2+, both in control cells and in the presence of vanadate or tetrathionate, suggesting efflux by carrier-mediated Ca/Ca exchange. The 57Co uptake is similar in fed cells and in ATP-depleted cells (exposed to iodoacetamide), consistent with the notion that Co2+ is not transported by the Ca-pump. The transporter is thus neither SH-group nor ATP or phosphorylation dependent. The 57Co uptake shows several similarities with the 45Ca uptake in ATP-depleted cells supplemented with tetrathionate. The uptake is linear with time, and increases with the cobalt concentration with a saturating component, with Jmax about 16μmol(lcells)−1h−1 and K½(Co) about 0.1mM, plus a non-saturating component. The 57Co and 45Ca uptake shows mutual inhibition, and at least the stochastic Ca2+ influx is inhibited by Co2+. The 57Co and 45Ca uptake are both insensitive to the 1,4-dihydropyridine Ca-channel blocker nifedipine, even at 100μM. The 57Co uptake is increased at high negative membrane potentials, indicating that the uptake is at least partially electrogenic. The 57Co influx amounts to about half the 45Ca influx in ATP-depleted cells. It is speculated that the basal Ca2+ and Co2+ uptake could be mediated by a common transporter, probably with a channel-like and a carrier-mediated component, and that 57Co could be useful as a tracer for at least the channel-like Ca2+ entry pathway in red cells, since it is not itself transported by the Ca-pump and, moreover, is effectively buffered in the cytosol by binding to hemoglobin, without interfering with Ca2+ buffering. The molecular identity of the putative common transporter(s) remains to be defined.

Abstract: Database searches have shown that a part of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) transcripts may originate at an alternative upstream promoter (P2) located 2.6kb upstream of the known (P1) GBA promoter. The putative alternative transcripts contained one or two extra exons (exon −2 or exons −2, −1, respectively), but the first ATG codon and predicted amino-acid sequence are the same as in the transcript from P1. Luciferase assays confirmed promoter activity of both sites in HepG2 cells: the P1 construct exhibited the highest activity of luciferase (17.82±1.10 relative luciferase units), while the P2 construct reached 3.01±0.43 relative luciferase units. Serial 5′ deletions of P2 led to changes in reporter activity, the most prominent decreases were observed in deletion constructs carrying bases −353 to −658, and −353 to −920 (numbered as in NM_001005750.1), respectively. This suggests that the P2 core promoter is contained within the region of −920bp to −1311bp. Three P2 transcription initiation sites were found by 5′ RACE at positions 347, 380, and 413bp upstream of the +1 ATG. The expression stability of transcripts from P2, P1 was studied in 20 human tissues and was higher than that of GAPDH and ACTB, which are commonly used as reference housekeeping genes. The P2 contains an unmethylated CpG island, multiple Sp-1 consensus binding sites and, unlike P1, does not contain a TATA box, features all common to the majority of housekeeping gene promoters. We have examined DNA samples from a phenotypically diverse group of twenty Ashkenazi Jewish Gaucher patients homozygous for the common mild mutation N370S. Both P1 and P2, as well as exons −2 and −1, did not contain any sequence variations, with the exception of the known polymorphism rs10908459 found on one allele. The phenotypical differences in the patients were thus not explained by nucleotide variations in both promoters.

Abstract: The PAX5 is essential in normal B-cell lymphopoiesis and deregulation of PAX5 function is believed to contribute to leukemogenesis in B-ALL. We performed a comprehensive study using FISH, G-banding and IHC to identify PAX5 deletion and expression in 102 CD19+ clinical B-ALL cases (79 children and 33 adults) and investigated its relationship with common cytogenetic changes including BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1 and MLL rearrangements, and CDKN2A deletion. The incidences of translocations and deletions were 2.5% and 10.0% in children, and 0.0% and 18.2% in adults, respectively. The incidence of PAX5 deletion was higher than those of BCR-ABL1 (8.9%) or MLL rearrangements (5.1%) in children and than that of MLL rearrangement (3.1%) in adults. Most patients with PAX5 deletion (83.3% of children and 100.0% of adults with PAX5 deletion) had concurrent CDKN2A deletion. PAX5 deletions were detected both in patients with positive and negative PAX5 expression. In this study, we found that PAX5 is a common target in leukemogenesis of B-ALL along with CDKN2A. Owing to its frequent deletion in B-ALL, PAX5 could be used as one of the molecular markers in diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. No correlation between expression of PAX5 and deletion of PAX5 suggests allele-specific regulation.

Abstract: The β-hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias are serious genetic blood disorders affecting the β-globin chain of hemoglobin A (α2βΑ2). Their clinical severity can be reduced by enhancing expression of fetal hemoglobin (γ-globin), producing HbF (α2γ2,). In studies reported here, γ-globin induction by 23 novel, structurally-unrelated compounds, which had been predicted through molecular modeling and in silico screening of a 13,000 chemical library, was evaluated in vitro in erythroid progenitors cultured from normal subjects and β-thalassemia patients, and in vivo in transgenic mice or anemic baboons. Four predicted candidates were found to have high potency, with 4- to 8-fold induction of HbF. Two of these compounds have pharmacokinetic profiles favorable for clinical application. These studies thus effectively identified high potency γ-globin inducing candidate therapeutics and validated the utility of in silico molecular modeling.

Abstract: During muscle development and regeneration of skeletal muscle in mice connexin43 (Cx43) and connexin39 (Cx39) are specifically expressed: Cx43 in satellite cells and myoblasts, whereas Cx39 is exclusively expressed in myogenin-positive cells. We generated Cx39 deficient mice by replacing the coding region of the Gjd4 gene by DNA coding for the enhanced green fluorescent protein eGFP. Adult Cx39 deficient mice exhibit no obvious phenotypic alterations of skeletal muscle compared to wild type mice in the resting state. However, myogenesis in Cx39 deficient embryos is accelerated as indicated by increased myogenin expression on ED13.5 and ED16.5 and increased expression of Cx43 in developing skeletal muscle. In addition, the regeneration process of skeletal muscle in Cx39 deficient mice is accelerated as shown by a 2day earlier onset of MyoD and myogenin expression, relative to wild type littermates. Interestingly, Cx43 expression was also upregulated in Cx39 deficient mice during regeneration of skeletal muscle. We hypothesize that Cx43 may compensate for the loss of Cx39 during myogenesis and regeneration.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in experimental treatments for various conditions that involve normal tissue regeneration via inflammatory repair. It is known that MSCs can secrete multiple soluble factors and suppress inflammation. Even though the effect of MSCs on inflammation has been extensively studied, the effect of inflammation on MSCs is poorly understood. One of the major cytokines released at the site of inflammation is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) which is known to induce MSC invasion and proliferation. Therefore, we wanted to test the effects of TNF-α exposure on MSCs derived from human bone marrow. We found, as expected, that cell proliferation was significantly enhanced during TNF-α exposure. However, according to the cell surface marker analysis, the intensity of several antigens in the minimum criteria panel for MSCs proposed by International Society of Cellular Therapy (ISCT) was decreased dramatically, and in certain cases, the criteria for MSCs were not fulfilled. In addition, TNF-α exposure resulted in a significant but transient increase in human leukocyte antigen and CD54 expression. Additional proteomic analysis by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry revealed three proteins whose expression levels decreased and 8 proteins whose expression levels increased significantly during TNF-α exposure. The majority of these proteins could be linked to immunosuppressive and signalling pathways. These results strongly support reactive and immunosuppressive activation of MSCs during TNF-α exposure, which might influence MSC differentiation stage and capacity.

Abstract: Here, we report the establishment of a permanent skin cell culture from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The cells of the fish skin cell culture could be propagated over 60 passages so far. Furthermore, we show for the first time that it is possible to integrate freshly harvested rainbow trout scales into this new fish skin cell culture. We further demonstrated that epithelial cells derived from the scales survived in the artificial micro-environment of surrounding fibroblast-like cells. Also, antibody staining indicated that both cell types proliferated and started to build connections with the other cell type. It seems that it is possible to generate an ‘artificial skin’ with two different cell types. This could lead to the development of a three-dimensional test system, which might be a better in vitro representative of fish skin in vivo than individual skin cell lines.

Abstract: We report on a truncated α-spectrin chain, spectrinExeter, associated with ellipto-poikilocytosis. Analysis of erythrocyte membranes of affected individuals revealed a truncated α-spectrin chain with normal amounts of spectrin dimer. In the proband and her father, one haploid set of α-spectrin cDNA lacked exons 11 and 12, leading to partial deletion of repeats α4 and α5 (83 amino acids) of the α-spectrin chain. In one allele of genomic DNA, a 3567bp deletion starting in intron 10 and ending in intron 12 of the SPTA1 gene was found. The common polymorphic SPTA1 αLELY allele was found in trans to the SPTA1αExeter allele in the proband. The proband had inherited the SPTA1Exeter allele from her father and the αLELY allele from her healthy, asymptomatic mother. This is the first report of an interstitial deletion in the SPTA1 gene associated with ellipto-poikilocytosis.

Abstract: The homeodomain-only protein (HOP) contains an atypical homeodomain which is unable to bind to DNA due to mutations in residues important for DNA binding. Recently, HOP was reported to regulate proliferation/differentiation homeostasis in different cell types. In the present study, we performed transcriptional profiling of cultured primary human keratinocytes and noted a robust induction of HOP upon calcium-induced cell differentiation. Immunohistochemistry of human skin localized HOP to the granular layer in the epidermis. Overexpression of HOP using a lentiviral vector up-regulated FLG and LOR expression during keratinocyte differentiation. Conversely, decreasing HOP expression using small interfering RNA markedly reduced the calcium-induced expression of late markers of differentiation in vitro, with the most prominent effect on profilaggrin (FLG) mRNA. Moreover, mRNA levels of profilaggrin and loricrin were downregulated in the epidermis of HOP knockout mice. Analysis of skin disorders revealed altered HOP expression in lichen planus, psoriasis and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Our data indicate that HOP is a novel modulator of late terminal differentiation in keratinocytes.

Abstract: Disorganization of the desmin network is associated with cardiac and skeletal myopathies characterized by accumulation of desmin-containing aggregates in the cells. Multiple associations of intermediate filament proteins form a network to increase mechanical and functional stability. Synemin is a desmin-associated type VI intermediate filament protein. Neither its impact on desmin network nor how it integrates into desmin filament is yet elucidated. To gain more insight into the molecular basis of these processes, we coexpressed synemin with different desmin mutants in ex vivo models. The screening of fourteen desmin mutants showed that synemin with desmin mutants revealed two behaviors. Firstly, synemin was co-localized in desmin aggregates and its coexpression decreased the number of cells containing aggregates. Secondly, synemin was excluded from the aggregates, then synemin had no effect on desmin network organization. Among fourteen desmin mutants, there were only three mutants, p.E401K, p.R406W and p.E413K, in which synemin was not found in aggregates. This behavior was correlated to the abnormal salt-bridges of desmin-dimer as seen in silico constructs. Moreover, desmin constructs in silico and published results in literature have predicted that the salt-bridges absence in the desmin filament building prevent longitudinal annealing and/or radial compaction. These results suggest that the state of desmin-filament assembly is crucial for synemin anchorage and consequently might involve mechanical and functional stability of the cytoskeletal network.

Abstract: The eisosome protein Pil1 is known to be implicated in the endocytosis of Ste3, but the precise biological function of it during endocytosis is poorly understood. Here, we present data to reveal Pil1's role in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Using live cell imaging, we show that endocytic patches carrying Abp1 and Las17 persisted much longer in PIL1-deficient cells. The loss of Pil1 also greatly affected both the scission efficiency and the frequency of formation of endocytic sites carrying Rvs161- and Rvs167-GFP. Furthermore, the mistargeting of the synaptojanins, Sjl1 and Sjl2, to the cytoplasm in pil1Δ cells suggests that Pil1 is required for the proper recruitment of the synaptojanins to endocytic sites. A severe motility defect of Abp1-GFP during its internalization in a codeletant of PIL1 and SJL2 indicates a functional interplay between them in endocytosis. Together, these results establish that Pil1 is involved in the recruitment of endocytic proteins to optimize endocytosis.

Abstract: In response to sodium butyrate and trichostatin A treatment in erythroid cells, p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) mediates fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction by activating cAMP response element binding protein 1 (CREB1). To expand on this observation, we completed studies to determine the role of p38 MAPK in steady-state γ-globin regulation. We propose that p38 signaling regulates Gγ-globin transcription during erythroid maturation through its downstream effector CREB1 which binds the Gγ-globin cAMP response element (G-CRE). We demonstrated that a loss of p38 or CREB1 function by siRNA knockdown resulted in target gene silencing. Moreover, gain of p38 or CREB1 function augments γ-globin transcription. These regulatory effects were conserved under physiological conditions tested in primary erythroid cells. When the G-CRE was mutated in a stable chromatin environment Gγ-globin promoter activity was nearly abolished. Furthermore, introduction of mutations in the G-CRE abolished Gγ-globin activation via p38 MAPK/CREB1 signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP) demonstrated that CREB1 and its binding partner CREB binding protein (CBP) co-localize at the G-CRE region. These data support the role of p38 MAPK/CREB1 signaling in Gγ-globin gene transcription under steady-state conditions.

Abstract: Cell based therapies for bone regeneration are an exciting emerging technology, but the availability of osteogenic cells is limited and an ideal cell source has not been identified. Amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFS) and bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were compared to determine their osteogenic differentiation capacity in both 2D and 3D environments. In 2D culture, the AFS cells produced more mineralized matrix but delayed peaks in osteogenic markers. Cells were also cultured on 3D scaffolds constructed of poly-ε-caprolactone for 15weeks. MSCs differentiated more quickly than AFS cells on 3D scaffolds, but mineralized matrix production slowed considerably after 5weeks. In contrast, the rate of AFS cell mineralization continued to increase out to 15weeks, at which time AFS constructs contained 5-fold more mineralized matrix than MSC constructs. Therefore, cell source should be taken into consideration when used for cell therapy, as the MSCs would be a good choice for immediate matrix production, but the AFS cells would continue robust mineralization for an extended period of time. This study demonstrates that stem cell source can dramatically influence the magnitude and rate of osteogenic differentiation in vitro.

Abstract: Background
Chronic blood transfusion (CBT) is currently the standard of care for primary and secondary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA). However, the effect of CBT on cerebrovascular pathology is not well known.
Methods
We reviewed children with SCA receiving CBT for abnormal transcranial Doppler (TCD) [n=12] or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) [n=22]. Baseline cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) were compared with the most recent scans available for each patient and independently scored by a neuroradiologist.
Results
Thirty-four patients with a mean age of 6.5years at the time of baseline MRI/MRA were studied. Average elapsed time from baseline to most recent scans was 7.3years. Overall, patients experienced worsening vasculopathy, as measured by mean increases in their baseline MRI and MRA scores of +0.76 and +1.03. There was a significant difference in the mean change of MRI/MRA scores between patients who had CVA and abnormal TCD (MRI; +1.23 vs. −0.08, p=0.001 and MRA; +1.54 vs. +0.08, p=0.02). Patients with abnormal baseline MRA had worsening scores compared to those with normal baseline MRA (54% vs. 9.5%, p=0.01). Also, patients who had CVA were more likely to have an abnormal baseline MRA and worsening scores compared to abnormal TCD patients.
Conclusion
We show that children with CVA experience progression of cerebral vasculopathy despite CBT. In contrast, CBT for abnormal TCD confers protection against the development and/or progression of cerebral vasculopathy. This effect appears to be real given our large cohort of patients with longer follow up as compared to previous studies.

Abstract: Combined chelation treatment may be a better approach for transfusion-dependent thalassemia major patients with iron overload complications because of increased efficacy. Combination therapy with desferrioxamine and deferiprone has already been reported to improve survival dramatically by reversing cardiac dysfunction and other endocrine complications. Some patients have intolerance or inconvenience to parenteral desferrioxamine. The hypothesis of this study was that combining two oral chelators, deferiprone and deferasirox, might lead to similar results. Following approval by the hospital ethical committee and a written informed consent from each patient, 16 patients who fulfilled the criteria participated in a study protocol for a period of up to 2 years. Efficacy measures analysis demonstrated a statistically significant decrease of total body iron load as estimated by serum ferritin, LIC and MRI T2* indices. Regarding the safety assessment, the incidence of adverse events was minor compared to the associated toxicity of monotherapy of each drug. No new onset of iron overload-related complications was demonstrated. A reversal of cardiac dysfunction was observed in 2/4 patients, while the mean LVEF increased significantly. Regarding endocrine assessment, in 2/8 patients with impaired glucose tolerance, we noted a significant decrease in the mean 2h glucose in OGTT. Additionally an improvement in gonadal function was observed and one male and one female gave birth to two healthy children without hormonal stimulation. Combined oral chelation in thalassemia offers the promise of easier administration, better compliance and may lead to an improvement of patient quality of life by preventing or even reversing iron overload complications.

Abstract: Serum-free differentiation protocols of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) offer the ability to maximize reproducibility and to develop clinically applicable therapies. We developed a high-throughput, 96-well plate, four-color flow cytometry-based assay to optimize differentiation media cocktails and to screen a variety of conditions. We were able to differentiate hESCs to all three primary germ layers, screen for the effect of a range of activin A, BMP4, and VEGF concentrations on endoderm and mesoderm differentiation, and perform RNA-interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of a reporter gene during differentiation. Cells were seeded in suspension culture and embryoid bodies were induced to differentiate to the three primary germ layers for 6days. Endoderm (CXCR4+KDR–), mesoderm (KDR+SSEA-3–), and ectoderm (SSEA-3+NCAM+) differentiation yields for H9 cells were 80±11, 78±7, and 41±9%, respectively. Germ layer identities were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Activin A, BMP4, and bFGF drove differentiation, with increasing concentrations of activin A inducing higher endoderm yields and increasing BMP4 inducing higher mesoderm yields. VEGF drove lateral mesoderm differentiation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of constitutively expressed red fluorescent protein did not affect endoderm differentiation. This assay facilitates the development of serum-free protocols for hESC differentiation to target lineages and creates a platform for screening small molecules or RNAi during ESC differentiation.

Abstract: Oligodendrocytes are myelinating cells of the CNS that originate as progenitor cells (OP) in discrete areas of the developing brain. During brain development, OP migrate significant distances prior to proliferating and myelinating the axons of the putative white matter tracts. Growth factors play a major regulatory role in the behavior of OP. Specifically, platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) are two of the most well characterized regulators of OP development. Both growth factors interact with tyrosine kinase receptors, activating various intracellular signaling pathways. The current study advances our earlier research by comparing the effects of both PDGF-A and FGF2 on OP migration. Our results show that activation of ERK is required for OP migration. These findings correlate well with our previous demonstration of the ERK pathway mediating PDGF-A induced OP migration. We also demonstrate the significance of threshold levels of growth factors and temporal regulation for OP migration. In addition, ERK activation alone is not sufficient to induce OP migration. The current research supports the involvement of the non-ERK mediated signaling pathway in OP migration.

Abstract: Several anticoagulants, anti-platelet and thrombolytic medications are used for the treatment of thrombotic disorders. Anti-coagulants and anti-platelet agents prevent the formation of blood clots but do not dissolve existing clots, whereas thrombolytic agents are able to dissolve a clot but emboli can form even after successful treatment. Thus, none of them provide a permanent and complete solution. In this regard a single molecule that could both dissolve the clot and prevent the formation of new clots would be useful in the treatment of thrombotic diseases. Crinumin, a stable and active (in many adverse conditions) serine protease, shows plasmin-like fibrinolytic activity and inhibits platelet aggregation and P-selectin exposure, as established by photography, phase contrast microscopy, whole blood optical Lumi-aggregometry and flow cytometry. Crinumin could be an efficient and inexpensive therapeutic agent for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic diseases.

Abstract: Deciphering molecular pathways involved in the early steps of prostate oncogenesis requires both in vitro and in vivo models derived from human primary tumors. However the few recognized models of human prostate epithelial cancer originate from metastases. To date, very few models are proposed from primary tumors and immortalizing normal human prostate cells does not recapitulate the natural history of the disease. By culturing human prostate primary tumor cells onto human epithelial extra-cellular matrix, we successfully selected a new prostate cancer cell line, IGR-CaP1, and clonally-derived subclones. IGR-CaP1 cells, that harbor a tetraploid karyotype, high telomerase activity and mutated TP53, rapidly induced subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, IGR-CaP1 cell lines, all exhibiting negativity for the androgen receptor and PSA, express the specific prostate markers alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase and a low level of the prostate-specific membrane antigen PSMA, along with the prostate basal epithelial markers CK5 and CK14. More importantly, these clones express high CD44, CD133, and CXCR4 levels associated with high expression of α2β1-integrin and Oct4 which are reported to be prostate cancer stemness markers. RT-PCR data also revealed high activation of the Sonic Hedgehog signalling pathway in these cells. Additionally, the IGR-CaP1 cells possess a 3D sphere-forming ability and a renewal capacity by maintaining their CSC potential after xenografting in mice. As a result, the hormone-independent IGR-CaP1 cellular clones exhibit the original features of both basal prostate tissue and cancer stemness. Tumorigenic IGR-CaP1 clones constitute invaluable human models for studying prostate cancer progression and drug assessment in vitro as well as in animals specifically for developing new therapeutic approaches targeting prostate cancer stem cells.

Abstract: Smad4, originally isolated from the human chromosome 18q21, is a key factor in transducing the signals of the TGF-β superfamily of growth hormones and plays a pivotal role in mediating antimitogenic and proapoptotic effects of TGF-β, but the mechanisms by which Smad4 induces apoptosis are elusive. Here we report that Smad4 directly translocates to the mitochondria of apoptotic cells. Smad4 gene silencing by siRNA inhibits TGF-β-induced apoptosis in Hep3B cells and UV-induced apoptosis in PANC-1 cells. Cell fractionation assays demonstrated that a fraction of Smad4 translocates to mitochondria after long time TGF-β treatment or UV exposure, during which the cells were under apoptosis. Smad4 mitochondria translocation during apoptosis was also confirmed by fluorescence observation of Smad4 colocalization with MitoTracker Red. We searched for mitochondria proteins that have physical interactions with Smad4 using yeast two-hybrid screening approach. DNA sequence analysis identified 34 positive clones, five of which encoded subunits in mitochondria complex IV, i.e., one clone encoded cytochrome c oxidase COXII, three clones encoded COXIII and one clone encoded COXVb. Strong interaction between Smad4 with COXII, an important apoptosis regulator, was verified in yeast by β-gal activity assays and in mammalian cells by immunoprecipitation assays. Further, mitochondrial portion of cells was isolated and the interaction between COXII and Smad4 in mitochondria upon TGF-β treatment or UV exposure was confirmed. Importantly, targeting Smad4 to mitochondria using import leader fusions enhanced TGF-β-induced apoptosis. Collectively, the results suggest that Smad4 promote apoptosis of the cells through its mitochondrial translocation and association with mitochondria protein COXII.

Abstract: This article summarizes the conclusions of a recent study carried out by management consultancy McKinsey on behalf of a European industry-government consortium. We extract the key findings in the report, A portfolio of power-trains for Europe: a fact-based analysis, in particular as they relate to fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and the associated hydrogen refueling infrastructure. The study takes into account the estimated costs of scaling up a sufficient hydrogen infrastructure, and finds that they are not a barrier for market acceptance of FCVs.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major causative agent of chronic liver disease in humans. To gain insight into host factor requirements for HCV replication, we performed a siRNA screen of the human kinome and identified 13 different kinases, including phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase III alpha (PI4KIIIα), as being required for HCV replication. Consistent with elevated levels of the PI4KIIIα product phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) detected in HCV-infected cultured hepatocytes and liver tissue from chronic hepatitis C patients, the enzymatic activity of PI4KIIIα was critical for HCV replication. Viral nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) was found to interact with PI4KIIIα and stimulate its kinase activity. The absence of PI4KIIIα activity induced a dramatic change in the ultrastructural morphology of the membranous HCV replication complex. Our analysis suggests that the direct activation of a lipid kinase by HCV NS5A contributes critically to the integrity of the membranous viral replication complex.

Abstract: Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) inhibit cholinergic synaptic transmission by specifically cleaving proteins that are crucial for neurotransmitter exocytosis. Due to the lethality of these toxins, there are elevated concerns regarding their possible use as bioterrorism agents. Moreover, their widespread use for cosmetic purposes, and as medical treatments, has increased the potential risk of accidental overdosing and environmental exposure. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel modalities to counter BoNT intoxication. Mammalian motoneurons are the main target of BoNTs; however, due to the difficulty and poor efficiency of the procedures required to isolate the cells, they are not suitable for high-throughput drug screening assays. Here, we explored the suitability of embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived motoneurons as a renewable, reproducible, and physiologically relevant system for BoNT studies. We found that the sensitivity of ES-derived motoneurons to BoNT/A intoxication is comparable to that of primary mouse spinal motoneurons. Additionally, we demonstrated that several BoNT/A inhibitors protected SNAP-25, the BoNT/A substrate, in the ES-derived motoneuron system. Furthermore, this system is compatible with immunofluorescence-based high-throughput studies. These data suggest that ES-derived motoneurons provide a highly sensitive system that is amenable to large-scale screenings to rapidly identify and evaluate the biological efficacies of novel therapeutics.

Abstract: How the co-ordinated events of gene activation and silencing during cellular differentiation are influenced by spatial organization of the cell nucleus is still poorly understood. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling subnuclear distribution of transcription factors, and their interplay with nuclear proteins that shape chromatin structure. Here we show that C/EBPβ not only associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin but also interacts with the nucleoskeleton upon induction of adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Different C/EBPβ dimers localize in different nuclear domains. Using BiFC in living cells, we show that LAP (Liver Activating Protein) homodimers localize in euchromatin and heterochromatin. In contrast, LIP (Liver Inhibitory Protein) homodimers localize exclusively in heterochromatin. Importantly, their differential subnuclear distribution mirrors the site for interaction with HP1α. HP1α inhibits LAP transcriptional capacity and occupies the promoter of the C/EBPβ-dependent gene c/ebpα in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. When adipogenesis is induced, HP1α binding decreases from c/ebpα promoter, allowing transcription. Thus, the equilibrium among different pools of C/EBPβ associated with chromatin or nucleoskeleton, and dynamic changes in their interaction with HP1α, play key roles in the regulation of C/EBP target genes during adipogenesis.

Abstract: We have previously shown that heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) markedly inhibits H2O2-induced apoptosis in mouse C2C12 myogenic cells by reducing the release of Smac. However, the molecular mechanism by which HSP70 interferes with Smac release during oxidative stress-induced apoptosis is not understood. In the current study, we showed that HSP70 increased the stability of Bcl-2 during oxidative stress. An antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide against Bcl-2 caused selective inhibition of Bcl-2 protein expression induced by HSP70 and significantly attenuated HSP70-mediated cell protection against H2O2-induced release of Smac and apoptosis. Taken together, our results indicate that there are important relationships among HSP70, Bcl-2, release of Smac, and induction of apoptosis by oxidative stress.

Abstract: Protein kinase Cα (PKCα) is a classical PKC isoform whose involvement in cell death is not completely understood. Bax, a major member of the Bcl-2 family, is required for apoptotic cell death and regulation of Bax translocation and insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane is crucial for regulation of the apoptotic process. Here we show that PKCα increases the translocation and insertion of Bax c-myc (an active form of Bax) into the outer membrane of yeast mitochondria. This is associated with an increase in cytochrome c (cyt c) release, reactive oxygen species production (ROS), mitochondrial network fragmentation and cell death. This cell death process is regulated, since it correlates with an increase in autophagy but not with plasma membrane permeabilization. The observed increase in Bax c-myc translocation and insertion by PKCα is not due to Bax c-myc phosphorylation, and the higher cell death observed is independent of the PKCα kinase activity. PKCα may therefore have functions other than its kinase activity that aid in Bax c-myc translocation and insertion into mitochondria. Together, these results give a mechanistic insight on apoptosis regulation by PKCα through regulation of Bax insertion into mitochondria.

Abstract: KLF2 is a Krüppel-like zinc-finger transcription factor required for blood vessel, lung, T-cell and erythroid development. KLF2−/− mice die by embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), due to hemorrhaging and heart failure. In KLF2−/− embryos, β-like globin gene expression is reduced, and E10.5 erythroid cells exhibit abnormal morphology. In this study, other genes regulated by KLF2 were identified by comparing E9.5 KLF2−/− and wild-type (WT) yolk sac erythroid precursor cells, using laser capture microdissection and microarray assays. One hundred and ninety-six genes exhibited significant differences in expression between KLF2−/− and WT; eighty-nine of these are downregulated in KLF2−/−. Genes involved in cell migration, differentiation and development are over-represented in the KLF2-regulated gene list. The SOX2 gene, encoding a pluripotency factor, is regulated by KLF2 in both ES and embryonic erythroid cells. Previous work had identified genes with erythroid-enriched expression in the yolk sac. The erythroid-enriched genes reelin, adenylate cyclase 7, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 2 alpha, and CD24a antigen are downregulated in KLF2−/− compared to WT and are therefore candidates for controlling primitive erythropoiesis. Each of these genes contains a putative KLF2 binding site(s) in its promoter and/or an intron. Reelin has an established role in neuronal development. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that KLF2 directly transactivates the reelin promoter in erythroid cells, validating this approach to identify KLF2 target genes.

Abstract: The mammalian mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases are a family of enzymes related to bacterial toxins that can catalyse both intracellular and extracellular mono-ADP-ribosylation of target proteins involved in different cellular processes, such as cell migration, signalling and inflammation. Here, we report the molecular cloning and functional characterisation of a novel glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase isoform from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (cARTC2.1) that has both NAD-glycohydrolase and arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase activities. cARTC2.1 has the R-S-EXE active-site motif that is typical of arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases, with Glu209 as the predicted catalytic amino acid. When over-expressed in CHO cells, the E209G single point mutant of cARTC2.1 cannot hydrolyse NAD+, although it retains low arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. This ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was abolished only with an additional mutation in the R-S-EXE active-site motif, with both of the glutamate residues of the EKE sequence of cARTC2.1 mutated to glycine (E207/209G). These glutamate-mutated proteins localise to the plasma membrane, as does wild-type cARTC2.1. Thus, the partial or total loss of enzymatic activity of cARTC2.1 that arises from these mutations does not affect its cellular localisation. Importantly, an endogenous ADP-ribosyltransferase is indeed expressed and active in a subset of CHO cells, while a similar activity cannot be detected in ovarian cancer cells. With respect to this endogenous ecto-ART activity, we have identified two cell populations: ART-positive and ART-negative CHO cells. The subset of ART-positive cells, which represented 5% of the total cells, is tightly maintained in the CHO cell population.

Abstract: Interferon-alpha (IFNα)-induced cell death of tumor cells is likely mediated through several signaling pathways. We previously demonstrated that blocking the activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase, PI3K, or mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR, partially inhibited apoptosis induced by IFNα. Here, we postulate using pharmacological inhibition and dominant negative mutants that activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1, STAT1, is also required for the cell death induced by IFNα. Inhibition of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding by a naturally occurring rotenoid deguelin also rescued U266 myeloma cell lines from IFNα-induced apoptosis. Deguelin had no effect on upstream Jak kinases or STAT2 phosphorylation suggesting the involvement of a yet unknown mechanism. Inhibition of STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and activity was independent of the known effects of deguelin on PI3K, Akt or mTOR as shown using selective pharmacological inhibitors against these kinases. The combination of deguelin and PI3K or mTOR antagonists further inhibited apoptosis suggesting that both the Jak–STAT and the PI3K/mTOR pathways contribute to the induction of apoptosis by IFNα in these cells. Over-expression of STAT1-Y701A or K410/413A mutants in Rhek-1 keratinocytes largely inhibited apoptosis further supporting the importance of STAT1 phosphorylation and activity for IFNα-induced cell death. Thus, at least two signaling pathways, one of which requires STAT1 activation, cooperate to mediate IFNα-induced apoptosis.

Abstract: Although reduction in leukocyte counts following hydroxyurea therapy in sickle cell disease (SCD) predicts fetal hemoglobin (HbF) response, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We previously reported that leukocyte counts are regulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in SCD patients. Here we examined the roles of GM-CSF in the regulation of HbF expression in SCD. Upon the analysis of retrospective data in 372 patients, HbF levels were inversely correlated with leukocyte counts and GM-CSF levels in SCD patients without hydroxyurea therapy, while HbF increments after hydroxyurea therapy correlated with a reduction in leukocyte counts, suggesting a negative effect of GM-CSF on HbF expression. Consistently, in vitro studies using primary erythroblasts showed that the addition of GM-CSF to erythroid cells decreased HbF expression. We next examined the intracellular signaling pathway through which GM-CSF reduced HbF expression. Treatment of erythroid cells with GM-CSF resulted in the reduction of intracellular cAMP levels and abrogated phosphorylation of cAMP response-element-binding-protein, suggesting attenuation of the cAMP-dependent pathway, while the phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein kinases were not affected. This is compatible with our studies showing a role for the cAMP-dependent pathway in HbF expression. Together, these results demonstrate that GM-CSF plays a role in regulating both leukocyte count and HbF expression in SCD. Reduction in GM-CSF levels upon hydroxyurea therapy may be critical for efficient HbF induction. The results showing the involvement of GM-CSF in HbF expression may suggest possible mechanisms for hydroxyurea resistance in SCD.

Abstract: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are generated by directly reprogramming somatic cells by forcing them to express the exogenous transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM). These cells could potentially be used in clinical applications and basic research. Here, we explored the molecular role of Sox2 by generating iPSCs that expressed Sox2 at various levels. Low Sox2 (LS) expression increased the efficiency of generating partially reprogrammed iPSCs in combination with OKM. Notably, we detected a significant increase in the number of fully reprogrammed iPSCs with three factors of OK and LS. LS expression was linked with the reduced expression of ectoderm and mesoderm marker genes. This indicates that cell differentiation into the ectoderm and mesoderm lineages was impeded during reprogramming. The quality of the iPSCs that was generated by using OK and LS was comparable to that of iPSCs that were produced via conventional OSK as seen by pluripotent marker gene expression and chimera formation. We conclude that Sox2 plays a crucial role in a dose-dependent manner in direct reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs.

Abstract: In solid body tissues, environmental biomechanics is indispensable for tissue homeostasis. While characteristics of homeostasis include morphogenesis, proliferation and differentiation, the influences through biomechanics in corneal keratinocytes are poorly understood. Here we show for the first time that corneal keratinocytes, established in a defined biomechanical microenvironment of micropatterned soft pillars, exhibit favoritism of late and terminal differentiation at large pillar patterns of 11μm with matched small 5μm arrays. At 11μm, epithelial cells expressed decreased levels of early differentiation marker cytokeratin 19 (KRT19), which was antagonized by an increase in biomarkers of late and terminal differentiation, i.e. cytokeratin 12 (KRT12), involucrin and filaggrin. Keratinocytes showed proper morphogenesis on 5μm arrays, whereas 11μm yielded in morphological disorders. While the propensity of keratinocyte proliferation appeared attenuated at large pillar patterns, stem cell marker ABCG2 was weak though homogeneous at 5μm, but strong at 11μm. Thus, corneal keratinocytes reveal interference of biomarker expression, morphogenesis and proliferation, which are at least in part characteristics of tissue homeostasis by mechanisms, depending on environmental biomechanics of micropattern-allocated cell adhesion points in vitro.

Abstract: Since bone pathology is a major concern in type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1), we evaluated bone mineral density (BMD) in adults receiving velaglucerase alfa in the seminal Phase I/II and extension trial. Ten treatment-naïve symptomatic patients with GD1 (four men, six women; median age 35years, range 18–62years) were included; of these, four patients were receiving bisphosphonates at enrollment. Using WHO criteria to classify the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) BMD T-scores, respectively, one (10%) and four (40%) patients had osteoporosis; eight (80%) and five (50%) had osteopenia; and one each (10%) was in the normal range, at baseline. By Month 69, two LS and one FN osteopenic patients normalized and one FN osteoporotic patient became osteopenic; change was seen only in patients not receiving bisphosphonates. Significant improvements in BMD Z-scores were seen at the LS by Month 24 and at the FN by Month 33 and were continuous thereafter. In linear mixed models, Z-scores were significantly lower than the reference population at baseline and improved significantly with treatment (LS and FN both P<0.01); analysis of the subgroup of patients not receiving bisphosphonates showed similar results. In conclusion, in this small cohort, velaglucerase alfa was associated with clinically meaningful and statistically significant LS and FN BMD improvements as early as Month 24 (LS) and 33 (FN), despite dose reduction and significant baseline skeletal pathology. These results suggest that velaglucerase alfa may hold promise in the management of skeletal pathology associated with GD1.

Abstract: Adipose tissue hypoxia is an early phenotype in obesity, associated with macrophage infiltration and local inflammation. Here we test the hypothesis that adipocytes in culture respond to a hypoxic environment with the release of pro-inflammatory factors that stimulate macrophage migration and cause muscle insulin resistance. 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured in a 1% O2 atmosphere responded with a classic hypoxia response by elevating protein expression of HIF-1α. This was associated with elevated mRNA expression and peptide release of cytokines TNFα, IL-6 and the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). The mRNA and protein expression of the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin was reduced. Conditioned medium from hypoxia-treated adipocytes (CM-H), inhibited insulin-stimulated and raised basal cell surface levels of GLUT4myc stably expressed in C2C12 myotubes. Insulin stimulation of Akt and AS160 phosphorylation, key regulators of GLUT4myc exocytosis, was markedly impaired. CM-H also caused activation of JNK and S6K, and elevated serine phosphorylation of IRS1 in the C2C12 myotubes. These effects were implicated in reducing propagation of insulin signaling to Akt and AS160. Heat inactivation of CM-H reversed its dual effects on GLUT4myc traffic in muscle cells. Interestingly, antibody-mediated neutralization of IL-6 in CM-H lowered its effect on both the basal and insulin-stimulated cell surface GLUT4myc compared to unmodified CM-H. IL-6 may have regulated GLUT4myc traffic through its action on AMPK. Additionally, antibody-mediated neutralization of MCP-1 partly reversed the inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4myc exocytosis caused by unmodified CM-H. In Transwell co-culture, hypoxia-challenged adipocytes attracted RAW 264.7 macrophages, consistent with elevated release of MCP-1 from adipocytes during hypoxia. Neutralization of MCP-1 in adipocyte CM-H prevented macrophage migration towards it and partly reversed the effect of CM-H on insulin response in muscle cells. We conclude that adipose tissue hypoxia may be an important trigger of its inflammatory response observed in obesity, and the elevated chemokine MCP-1 may contribute to increased macrophage migration towards adipose tissue and subsequent decreased insulin responsiveness of glucose uptake in muscle.

Abstract: Nectins are cell–cell adhesion molecules involved in the formation of various intercellular junctions and the establishment of apical-basal polarity at cell–cell adhesion sites. To have a better understanding of the roles of nectins in the formation of cell–cell junctions, we searched for new cytoplasmic binding partners for nectin. We report that nectin-1α associates with membrane palmitoylated protein 3 (MPP3), one of the human homologues of a Drosophila tumor suppressor gene, Disc large. Two major forms of MPP3 at 66 and 98kDa were detected, in conjunction with nectin-1α, suggesting that an association between the two may occur in various cell types. Nectin-1α recruits MPP3 to cell–cell contact sites, mediated by a PDZ-binding motif at the carboxyl terminus of nectin-1α. Association with MPP3 increases cell surface expression of nectin-1α and enhances nectin-1α ectodomain shedding, indicating that MPP3 regulates trafficking and processing of nectin-1α. Further study showed that MPP3 interacts with nectin-3α, but not with nectin-2α, showing that the association of nectins with MPP3 is isoform-specific. MPP5, another MPP family member, interacts with nectins with varying affinity and facilitates surface expression of nectin-1α, nectin-2α, and nectin-3α. These data suggest that wide interactions between nectins and MPP family members may occur in various cell–cell junctions and that these associations may regulate trafficking and processing of nectins.

Abstract: Lighter cells from density fractionated erythrocytes of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients carry higher amount of externalized phosphatidylserine (PS) and cell surface glycophorins compared to the denser counterparts. Further analysis also revealed that the denser cells contained higher levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) compared to the lighter cells, supported by the presence of larger number of F-cells in these populations. In this report, we have found direct evidence on the higher survival of the HbF rich erythrocytes in SCD.

Abstract: Autophagy is a catabolic process providing an alternative energy source for cells under stressful conditions such as starvation, growth factor deprivation or hypoxia. During involution of the bovine mammary gland autophagy is induced in mammary epithelial cells (MECs) as a survival mechanism, and is tightly regulated by hormones and growth factors necessary for gland development. In the present study we adapted the three-dimensional culture model to investigate the role of autophagy during formation of alveoli-like structures by bovine BME-UV1 MECs grown on extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Using confocal microscopy and Western-blot analyses of autophagic and apoptotic markers: LC3, and cleaved caspase-3, we showed that autophagy was induced in centrally localized cells within the developing acini. These cells lacked a direct contact with ECM, and formed a distinct population from the outer layer of cells. Induction of autophagy preceded apoptosis, but did not inhibit the formation of a hollow lumen. In the presence of steroid hormones: 17β-estradiol and progesterone, although autophagy was augmented, acini formation proceeded normally. In contrast, the major lactogenic hormone: prolactin, which supports functional differentiation of alveoli, did not alter induction of autophagy within the spheroids. BME-UV1 cells cultured on Matrigel in the presence of growth factors IGF-I and EGF formed larger, underdeveloped acini without lumens due to caspase-3 inhibition, and sustained autophagy in the centre of the spheroids, while TGF-β1 accelerated apoptosis, and increased autophagy significantly. Our observations suggest that sex steroids 17β-estradiol and progesterone, as well as growth factor TGF-β1 may regulate the development of the bovine mammary gland by inducing autophagy in addition to regulating proliferation and apoptosis of MECs. These data indicate that autophagy may play an important role during alveolargenesis.

Abstract: We investigated the migration of human leukocytes through endothelial cells (EC), and particularly their underlying basement membrane (BM). EC were cultured for 20days on 3μm-pore filters or collagen gels to form a distinct BM, and then treated with tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β or interferon-γ. Neutrophil migration through the cytokine-treated EC and BM was delayed for 20-day compared to 4-day cultures. The BM alone obstructed chemotaxis of neutrophils, and if fresh EC were briefly cultured on stripped BM, there was again a hold-up in migration. In studies with lymphocytes and monocytes, we could detect little hold-up of migration for 20-day versus 4-day cultures, in either the filter- or gel-based models. Direct microscopic observations showed that BM also held-up neutrophil migration under conditions of flow. Treatment of upper and/or lower compartments of filters with antibodies against integrins, showed that neutrophil migration through the endothelial monolayer was dependent on β2-integrins, but not β1- or β3-integrins. Migration from the subendothelial compartment was supported by β1- and β2-integrins for all cultures, but blockade of β3-integrin only inhibited migration effectively for 20-day cultures. Flow cytometry indicated that there was no net increase in expression of β1- or β3-integrins during neutrophil migration, and that their specific subendothelial function was likely dependent on turnover of integrins during migration. These studies show that BM is a distinct barrier to migration of human neutrophils, and that β3-integrins are particularly important in crossing this barrier. The lesser effect of BM on lymphocytes and monocytes supports the concept that crossing the BM is a separate, leukocyte-specific, regulated step in migration.

Abstract: Summary
Erythrocyte invasion by the merozoite is an obligatory stage in Plasmodium parasite infection and essential to malaria disease progression. Attempts to study this process have been hindered by the poor invasion synchrony of merozoites from the only in vitro culture-adapted human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Using fluorescence, three-dimensional structured illumination, and immunoelectron microscopy of filtered merozoites, we analyze cellular and molecular events underlying each discrete step of invasion. Monitoring the dynamics of these events revealed that commitment to the process is mediated through merozoite attachment to the erythrocyte, triggering all subsequent invasion events, which then proceed without obvious checkpoints. Instead, coordination of the invasion process involves formation of the merozoite-erythrocyte tight junction, which acts as a nexus for rhoptry secretion, surface-protein shedding, and actomyosin motor activation. The ability to break down each molecular step allows us to propose a comprehensive model for the molecular basis of parasite invasion.

Human skeletal muscle-derived stem cells retain stem cell properties after expansion in myosphere culture,

Abstract: Human skeletal muscle contains an accessible adult stem-cell compartment in which differentiated myofibers are maintained and replaced by a self-renewing stem cell pool. Previously, studies using mouse models have established a critical role for resident stem cells in skeletal muscle, but little is known about this paradigm in human muscle. Here, we report the reproducible isolation of a population of cells from human skeletal muscle that is able to proliferate for extended periods of time as floating clusters of rounded cells, termed “myospheres” or myosphere-derived progenitor cells (MDPCs). The phenotypic characteristics and functional properties of these cells were determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. Our results showed that these cells are clonogenic, express skeletal progenitor cell markers Pax7, ALDH1, Myod, and Desmin and the stem cell markers Nanog, Sox2, and Oct3/4 significantly elevated over controls. They could be maintained proliferatively active in vitro for more than 20weeks and passaged at least 18 times, despite an average donor-age of 63years. Individual clones (4.2%) derived from single cells were successfully expanded showing clonogenic potential and sustained proliferation of a subpopulation in the myospheres. Myosphere-derived cells were capable of spontaneous differentiation into myotubes in differentiation media and into other mesodermal cell lineages in induction media. We demonstrate here that direct culture and expansion of stem cells from human skeletal muscle is straightforward and reproducible with the appropriate technique. These cells may provide a viable resource of adult stem cells for future therapies of disease affecting skeletal muscle or mesenchymal lineage derived cell types.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the therapeutic effects of stem cell transplantation following myocardial infarction (MI) are mediated by paracrine factors. One of the main goals in the treatment of ischemic heart disease is to stimulate vascular repair mechanisms. Here, we sought to explore the therapeutic angiogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) secretions. Human MSC secretions were collected as conditioned medium (MSC-CM) using a clinically compliant protocol. Based on proteomic and pathway analysis of MSC-CM, an in vitro assay of HUVEC spheroids was performed identifying the angiogenic properties of MSC-CM. Subsequently, pigs were subjected to surgical left circumflex coronary artery ligation and randomized to intravenous MSC-CM treatment or non-CM (NCM) treatment for 7days. Three weeks after MI, myocardial capillary density was higher in pigs treated with MSC-CM (645±114 vs 981±55 capillaries/mm2; P=0.021), which was accompanied by reduced myocardial infarct size and preserved systolic and diastolic performance. Intravenous MSC-CM treatment after myocardial infarction increases capillary density and preserves cardiac function, probably by increasing myocardial perfusion.
