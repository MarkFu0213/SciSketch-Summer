Abstract: Prokaryotic and eukaryotic Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCX) control Ca2+ homeostasis. NCX orthologs exhibit up to 104-fold differences in their turnover rates (kcat), whereas the ratios between the cytosolic (cyt) and extracellular (ext) Km values (Kint = KmCyt/KmExt) are highly asymmetric and alike (Kint ≤ 0.1) among NCXs. The structural determinants controlling a huge divergence in kcat at comparable Kint remain unclear, although 11 (out of 12) ion-coordinating residues are highly conserved among NCXs. The crystal structure of the archaeal NCX (NCX_Mj) was explored for testing the mutational effects of pore-allied and loop residues on kcat and Kint. Among 55 tested residues, 26 mutations affect either kcat or Kint, where two major groups can be distinguished. The first group of mutations (14 residues) affect kcat rather than Kint. The majority of these residues (10 out of 14) are located within the extracellular vestibule near the pore center. The second group of mutations (12 residues) affect Kint rather than kcat, whereas the majority of residues (9 out 12) are randomly dispersed within the extracellular vestibule. In conjunction with computational modeling-simulations and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass-spectrometry (HDX-MS), the present mutational analysis highlights structural elements that differentially govern the intrinsic asymmetry and transport rates. The key residues, located at specific segments, can affect the characteristic features of local backbone dynamics and thus, the conformational flexibility of ion-transporting helices contributing to critical conformational transitions. The underlying mechanisms might have a physiological relevance for matching the response modes of NCX variants to cell-specific Ca2+ and Na+ signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Activity-dependent modifications strongly influence neural development. However, molecular programs underlying their context and circuit-specific effects are not well understood. To study global transcriptional changes associated with chronic elevation of synaptic activity, we performed cell-type-specific transcriptome profiling of Drosophila ventral lateral neurons (LNvs) in the developing visual circuit and identified activity-modified transcripts that are enriched in neuron morphogenesis, circadian regulation, and lipid metabolism and trafficking. Using bioinformatics and genetic analyses, we validated activity-induced isoform-specific upregulation of Drosophila lipophorin receptors LpR1 and LpR2, the homologs of mammalian low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family proteins. Furthermore, our morphological and physiological studies uncovered critical functions of neuronal lipophorin receptors (LpRs) in maintaining the structural and functional integrities in neurons challenged by chronic elevations of activity. Together, our findings identify LpRs as molecular targets for activity-dependent transcriptional regulation and reveal the functional significance of cell-type-specific regulation of neuronal lipid uptake in experience-dependent plasticity and adaptive responses.

Abstract: Summary
How specific genetic lesions contribute to transformation of non-malignant myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) are poorly understood. JARID2 is lost by chromosomal deletions in a proportion of MPN/MDS cases that progress to sAML. In this study, genetic mouse models and patient-derived xenografts demonstrated that JARID2 acts as a tumor suppressor in chronic myeloid disorders. Genetic deletion of Jarid2 either reduced overall survival of animals with MPNs or drove transformation to sAML, depending on the timing and context of co-operating mutations. Mechanistically, JARID2 recruits PRC2 to epigenetically repress self-renewal pathways in hematopoietic progenitor cells. These studies establish JARID2 as a bona fide hematopoietic tumor suppressor and highlight potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription factor p63 is a key regulator of epidermal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Mutations in the p63 DNA-binding domain are associated with ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of these mutations remains unclear. Here, we characterized the transcriptome and epigenome of p63 mutant keratinocytes derived from EEC patients. The transcriptome of p63 mutant keratinocytes deviated from the normal epidermal cell identity. Epigenomic analyses showed an altered enhancer landscape in p63 mutant keratinocytes contributed by loss of p63-bound active enhancers and unexpected gain of enhancers. The gained enhancers were frequently bound by deregulated transcription factors such as RUNX1. Reversing RUNX1 overexpression partially rescued deregulated gene expression and the altered enhancer landscape. Our findings identify a disease mechanism whereby mutant p63 rewires the enhancer landscape and affects epidermal cell identity, consolidating the pivotal role of p63 in controlling the enhancer landscape of epidermal keratinocytes.

Abstract: Summary
Hippo-like pathways are ancient signaling modules first identified in yeasts. The best-defined metazoan module forms the core of the Hippo pathway, which regulates organ size and cell fate. Hippo-like kinase modules consist of a Sterile 20-like kinase, an NDR kinase, and non-catalytic protein scaffolds. In the Hippo pathway, the upstream kinase Hippo can be activated by another kinase, Tao-1. Here, we delineate a related Hippo-like signaling module that Tao-1 regulates to control tracheal morphogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Tao-1 activates the Sterile 20-like kinase GckIII by phosphorylating its activation loop, a mode of regulation that is conserved in humans. Tao-1 and GckIII act upstream of the NDR kinase Tricornered to ensure proper tube formation in trachea. Our study reveals that Tao-1 activates two related kinase modules to control both growth and morphogenesis. The Hippo-like signaling pathway we have delineated has a potential role in the human vascular disease cerebral cavernous malformation.

Abstract: Summary
The extracellular matrix plays a key role in stem cell maintenance, expansion, and differentiation. Laminin, a basement membrane protein, is a widely used substrate for cell culture including the growth of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Here, we show that different isoforms of laminin lead to the selective differentiation of hiPSCs into different eye-like tissues. Specifically, the 211 isoform of the E8 fragment of laminin (LN211E8) promotes differentiation into neural crest cells via Wnt activation, whereas LN332E8 promotes differentiation into corneal epithelial cells. The immunohistochemical distributions of these laminin isoforms in the developing mouse eye mirrors the hiPSC type that was induced in vitro. Moreover, LN511E8 enables generation of dense hiPSC colonies due to actomyosin contraction, which in turn led to cell density-dependent YAP inactivation and subsequent retinal differentiation in colony centers. Thus, distinct laminin isoforms determine the fate of expanded hiPSCs into eye-like tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are thought to be the major cause of the recurrence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) due to their potential for self-renewal. To identify therapeutic strategies targeting LSCs, while sparing healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we performed gene expression profiling of LSCs, HSCs, and leukemic progenitors all residing within the same AML bone marrow and identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) as differentially expressed. Low IGFBP7 is a feature of LSCs and is associated with reduced chemotherapy sensitivity. Enhancing IGFBP7 by overexpression or addition of recombinant human IGFBP7 (rhIGFBP7) resulted in differentiation, inhibition of cell survival, and increased chemotherapy sensitivity of primary AML cells. Adding rhIGFBP7 reduced leukemic stem and/or progenitor survival and reversed a stem-like gene signature, but it had no influence on normal hematopoietic stem cell survival. Our data suggest a potential clinical utility of the addition of rhIGFBP7 to current chemotherapy regimens to decrease AML relapse rates.

Abstract: Summary
How the principal functions of the Golgi apparatus—protein processing, lipid synthesis, and sorting of macromolecules—are integrated to constitute cargo-specific trafficking pathways originating from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is unknown. Here, we show that the activity of the Golgi localized SPCA1 calcium pump couples sorting and export of secreted proteins to synthesis of new lipid in the TGN membrane. A secreted Ca2+-binding protein, Cab45, constitutes the core component of a Ca2+-dependent, oligomerization-driven sorting mechanism whereby secreted proteins bound to Cab45 are packaged into a TGN-derived vesicular carrier whose membrane is enriched in sphingomyelin, a lipid implicated in TGN-to-cell surface transport. SPCA1 activity is controlled by the sphingomyelin content of the TGN membrane, such that local sphingomyelin synthesis promotes Ca2+ flux into the lumen of the TGN, which drives secretory protein sorting and export, thereby establishing a protein- and lipid-specific secretion pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of cellular surface markers that distinguish tumorous from normal vasculature is important for the development of tumor vessel-targeted therapy. Here, we show that Apj, a G protein-coupled receptor, is highly enriched in tumor endothelial cells but absent from most endothelial cells of adult tissues in homeostasis. By genetic targeting using Apj-CreER and Apj-DTRGFP-Luciferase, we demonstrated that hypoxia-VEGF signaling drives expansion of Apj+ tumor vessels and that targeting of these vessels, genetically and pharmacologically, remarkably inhibits tumor angiogenesis and restricts tumor growth. These in vivo findings implicate Apj+ vessels as a key driver of pathological angiogenesis and identify Apj+ endothelial cells as an important therapeutic target for the anti-angiogenic treatment of tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The HIV-1-envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the main target of antigen design for antibody-based prophylactic vaccines. The generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) likely requires the appropriate presentation of stabilized trimers preventing exposure of non-neutralizing antibody (nNAb) epitopes. We designed a series of membrane-bound Envs with increased trimer stability through the introduction of key stabilization mutations. We derived a stabilized HIV-1 trimer, ConSOSL.UFO.750, which displays a dramatic reduction in nNAb binding while maintaining high quaternary and MPER-specific bNAb binding. Its soluble counterpart, ConSOSL.UFO.664, displays similar antigenicity, and its native-like Env structure is confirmed by negative stain-EM and glycosylation profiling of the soluble ConSOSL.UFO.664 trimer. A rabbit immunization study demonstrated that the ConSOSL.UFO.664 can induce autologous tier 2 neutralization. We have successfully designed a stabilized native-like Env trimer amenable to nucleic acid or viral vector-based vaccination strategies.

Abstract: Ethylene regulates numerous aspects of plant growth and development. Multiple external and internal factors coordinate ethylene production in plant tissues. Transcriptional and post-translational regulations of ACC synthases (ACSs), which are key enzymes mediating a rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis have been well characterized. However, the regulation and physiological roles of ACC oxidases (ACOs) that catalyze the final step of ethylene biosynthesis are largely unknown in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that Arabidopsis ACO1 exhibits a tissue-specific expression pattern that is regulated by multiple signals, and plays roles in the lateral root development in Arabidopsis. Histochemical analysis of the ACO1 promoter indicated that ACO1 expression was largely modulated by light and plant hormones in a tissue-specific manner. We demonstrated that point mutations in two E-box motifs on the ACO1 promoter reduce the light-regulated expression patterns of ACO1. The aco1-1 mutant showed reduced ethylene production in root tips compared to wild-type. In addition, aco1-1 displayed altered lateral root formation. Our results suggest that Arabidopsis ACO1 integrates various signals into the ethylene biosynthesis that is required for ACO1’s intrinsic roles in root physiology.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with mtDNA depletion syndrome 3 (MTDPS3) often die as children from liver failure caused by severe reduction in mtDNA content. The identification of treatments has been impeded by an inability to culture and manipulate MTDPS3 primary hepatocytes. Here we generated DGUOK-deficient hepatocyte-like cells using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and used them to identify drugs that could improve mitochondrial ATP production and mitochondrial function. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was found to improve mitochondrial function in DGUOK-deficient hepatocyte-like cells by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α). NAD treatment also improved ATP production in MTDPS3-null rats and in hepatocyte-like cells that were deficient in ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2B (RRM2B), suggesting that it could be broadly effective. Our studies reveal that DGUOK-deficient iPSC-derived hepatocytes recapitulate the pathophysiology of MTDPS3 in culture and can be used to identify therapeutics for mtDNA depletion syndromes.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils are short-lived blood cells that play a critical role in host defense against infections. To better comprehend neutrophil functions and their regulation, we provide a complete epigenetic overview, assessing important functional features of their differentiation stages from bone marrow-residing progenitors to mature circulating cells. Integration of chromatin modifications, methylation, and transcriptome dynamics reveals an enforced regulation of differentiation, for cellular functions such as release of proteases, respiratory burst, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. We observe an early establishment of the cytotoxic capability, while the signaling components that activate these antimicrobial mechanisms are transcribed at later stages, outside the bone marrow, thus preventing toxic effects in the bone marrow niche. Altogether, these data reveal how the developmental dynamics of the chromatin landscape orchestrate the daily production of a large number of neutrophils required for innate host defense and provide a comprehensive overview of differentiating human neutrophils.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors (CDK4/6i) are effective in breast cancer; however, drug resistance is frequently encountered and poorly understood. We conducted a genomic analysis of 348 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers treated with CDK4/6i and identified loss-of-function mutations affecting FAT1 and RB1 linked to drug resistance. FAT1 loss led to marked elevations in CDK6, the suppression of which restored sensitivity to CDK4/6i. The induction of CDK6 was mediated by the Hippo pathway with accumulation of YAP and TAZ transcription factors on the CDK6 promoter. Genomic alterations in other Hippo pathway components were also found to promote CDK4/6i resistance. These findings uncover a tumor suppressor function of Hippo signaling in ER+ breast cancer and establish FAT1 loss as a mechanism of resistance to CDK4/6i.

Abstract: Summary
Macroautophagy and cell death both contribute to innate immunity, but little is known about how these processes integrate. Drosophila larval salivary glands require autophagy for developmentally programmed cell death, and innate immune signaling factors increase in these dying cells. Here, we show that the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) factor Relish, a component of the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway, is required for salivary gland degradation. Surprisingly, of the classic Imd pathway components, only Relish and the PGRP receptors were involved in salivary gland degradation. Significantly, Relish controls salivary gland degradation by regulating autophagy but not caspases. In addition, expression of either Relish or PGRP-LC causes premature autophagy induction and subsequent gland degradation. Relish controls autophagy by regulating the expression of Atg1, a core component and activator of the autophagy pathway. Together these findings demonstrate that a NF-κB pathway regulates autophagy during developmentally programmed cell death.

Abstract: Summary
As an essential step for brain morphogenesis, neurons migrate via mechanical interactions with components of their environment such as neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix. However, the molecular mechanism by which neurons exert forces on their environment during migration remains poorly understood. Here, we show that shootin1b is expressed in migrating mouse olfactory interneurons and accumulates at their leading process growth cone. We demonstrate that shootin1b, by binding to cortactin and L1-CAM, couples F-actin retrograde flow and the adhesive substrate as a clutch molecule. Shootin1b-mediated clutch coupling at the growth cone generates traction force on the substrate, thereby promoting leading process extension and subsequent somal translocation of olfactory interneurons. Furthermore, loss of shootin1 causes abnormal positioning of the interneurons and dysgenesis of the olfactory bulb. Our findings indicate that shootin1b plays a key role in force-driven leading process extension, which propels the migration of olfactory interneurons during olfactory bulb formation.

Abstract: Summary
Protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent mechanisms promote synaptic function in the mature brain. However, the roles of PKC signaling during synapse development remain largely unknown. Investigating each brain-enriched PKC isoform in early neuronal development, we show that PKCε acutely and specifically reduces the number of dendritic spines, sites of eventual synapse formation on developing dendrites. This PKCε-mediated spine suppression is temporally restricted to immature neurons and mediated through the phosphorylation and activation of Ephexin5, a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and inhibitor of hippocampal synapse formation. Our data suggest that PKCε acts as an early developmental inhibitor of dendritic spine formation, in contrast to its emerging pro-synaptic roles in mature brain function. Moreover, we identify a substrate of PKCε, Ephexin5, whose early-elevated expression in developing neurons may in part explain the mechanism by which PKCε plays seemingly opposing roles that depend on neuronal maturity.

Abstract: Summary
Tuberculosis claims >1 million lives annually, and its causative agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a highly successful pathogen. Protein kinase B (PknB) is reported to be critical for mycobacterial growth. Here, we demonstrate that PknB-depleted M. tuberculosis can replicate normally and can synthesize peptidoglycan in an osmoprotective medium. Comparative phosphoproteomics of PknB-producing and PknB-depleted mycobacteria identify CwlM, an essential regulator of peptidoglycan synthesis, as a major PknB substrate. Our complementation studies of a cwlM mutant of M. tuberculosis support CwlM phosphorylation as a likely molecular basis for PknB being essential for mycobacterial growth. We demonstrate that growing mycobacteria produce two forms of CwlM: a non-phosphorylated membrane-associated form and a PknB-phosphorylated cytoplasmic form. Furthermore, we show that the partner proteins for the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of CwlM are FhaA, a fork head-associated domain protein, and MurJ, a proposed lipid II flippase, respectively. From our results, we propose a model in which CwlM potentially regulates both the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan precursors and their transport across the cytoplasmic membrane.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin folded into 3D macromolecular structures is often analyzed by chromosome conformation capture (3C) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques, but these frequently provide contradictory results. Chromatin can be modeled as a simple polymer composed of a connected chain of units. By embedding data for epigenetic marks (H3K27ac), chromatin accessibility (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing [ATAC-seq]), and structural anchors (CCCTC-binding factor [CTCF]), we developed a highly predictive heteromorphic polymer (HiP-HoP) model, where the chromatin fiber varied along its length; combined with diffusing protein bridges and loop extrusion, this model predicted the 3D organization of genomic loci at a population and single-cell level. The model was validated at several gene loci, including the complex Pax6 gene, and was able to determine locus conformations across cell types with varying levels of transcriptional activity and explain different mechanisms of enhancer use. Minimal a priori knowledge of epigenetic marks is sufficient to recapitulate complex genomic loci in 3D and enable predictions of chromatin folding paths.

Abstract: Summary
Tcrb locus V(D)J recombination is regulated by positioning at the nuclear periphery. Here, we used DamID to profile Tcrb locus interactions with the nuclear lamina at high resolution. We identified a lamina-associated domain (LAD) border composed of several CTCF-binding elements that segregates active non-LAD from inactive LAD regions of the locus. Deletion of the LAD border causes an enhancer-dependent spread of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation from the active recombination center into recombination center-proximal LAD chromatin. This is associated with a disruption to nuclear lamina association, increased chromatin looping to the recombination center, and increased transcription and recombination of recombination center-proximal gene segments. Our results show that a LAD and LAD border are critical components of Tcrb locus gene regulation and suggest that LAD borders may generally function to constrain the activity of nearby enhancers.

Abstract: Summary
The lack of disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative disease stems in part from our rudimentary understanding of disease mechanisms and the paucity of targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we used an integrated discovery paradigm to identify a new therapeutic target for diseases caused by α-synuclein (α-syn), a small lipid-binding protein that misfolds and aggregates in Parkinson’s disease and other disorders. Using unbiased phenotypic screening, we identified a series of compounds that were cytoprotective against α-syn-mediated toxicity by inhibiting the highly conserved enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). Critically, reducing the levels of unsaturated membrane lipids by inhibiting SCD reduced α-syn toxicity in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neuronal models. Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of fatty acid desaturation has potential as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies.

Abstract: Summary
The regulation and functional roles of secreted coding and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs; >200 nt) are largely unknown. We previously showed that mutant KRAS colorectal cancer (CRC) cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing distinct proteomes, microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs. Here, we comprehensively identify diverse classes of CRC extracellular long RNAs secreted in EVs and demonstrate differential export of specific RNAs. Distinct noncoding RNAs, including antisense transcripts and transcripts derived from pseudogenes, are enriched in EVs compared to cellular profiles. We detected strong enrichment of Rab13 in mutant KRAS EVs and demonstrate functional delivery of Rab13 mRNA to recipient cells. To assay functional transfer of lncRNAs, we implemented a CRISPR/Cas9-based RNA-tracking system to monitor delivery to recipient cells. We show that gRNAs containing export signals from secreted RNAs can be transferred from donor to recipient cells. Our data support the existence of cellular mechanisms to selectively export diverse classes of RNA.

Abstract: Summary
Mapping the binding sites of DNA- or chromatin-interacting proteins is essential to understanding biological processes. DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) has emerged as a comprehensive method to map genome-wide occupancy of proteins of interest. A caveat of DamID is the specificity of Dam methyltransferase for GATC motifs that are not homogenously distributed in the genome. Here, we developed an optimized method named MadID, using proximity labeling of DNA by the methyltransferase M.EcoGII. M.EcoGII mediates N6-adenosine methylation in any DNA sequence context, resulting in deeper and unbiased coverage of the genome. We demonstrate, using m6A-specific immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing, that MadID is a robust method to identify protein-DNA interactions at the whole-genome level. Using MadID, we revealed contact sites between human telomeres, repetitive sequences devoid of GATC sites, and the nuclear envelope. Overall, MadID opens the way to identification of binding sites in genomic regions that were largely inaccessible.

Abstract: Summary
The integration of vascular structures into in vitro cultured tissues provides realistic models of complex tissue-vascular interactions. Despite the incidence and impact of muscle-wasting disorders, advanced in vitro systems are still far from recapitulating the environmental complexity of skeletal muscle. Our model comprises differentiated human muscle fibers enveloped by a sheath of human muscle-derived fibroblasts and supported by a vascular network with mural-like cells. Here, we demonstrate the induction of muscle-specific endothelium and the self-organization of endomysial muscle fibroblasts mediated by endothelial cells. We use this model to mimic the fibrotic environment characterizing muscular dystrophies and to highlight key signatures of fibrosis that are neglected or underestimated in traditional 2D monocultures. Overall, this vascularized meso-scale cellular construct finely recapitulates the human skeletal muscle environment and provides an advanced solution for in vitro studies of muscle physiology and pathology.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanistic models are essential to deepen the understanding of complex diseases at the molecular level. Nowadays, high-throughput molecular and phenotypic characterizations are possible, but the integration of such data with prior knowledge on signaling pathways is limited by the availability of scalable computational methods. Here, we present a computational framework for the parameterization of large-scale mechanistic models and its application to the prediction of drug response of cancer cell lines from exome and transcriptome sequencing data. This framework is over 104 times faster than state-of-the-art methods, which enables modeling at previously infeasible scales. By applying the framework to a model describing major cancer-associated pathways (>1,200 species and >2,600 reactions), we could predict the effect of drug combinations from single drug data. This is the first integration of high-throughput datasets using large-scale mechanistic models. We anticipate this to be the starting point for development of more comprehensive models allowing a deeper mechanistic insight.

Abstract: Summary
Regular successions of positioned nucleosomes, or phased nucleosome arrays (PNAs), are predominantly known from transcriptional start sites (TSSs). It is unclear whether PNAs occur elsewhere in the genome. To generate a comprehensive inventory of PNAs for Drosophila, we applied spectral analysis to nucleosome maps and identified thousands of PNAs throughout the genome. About half of them are not near TSSs and are strongly enriched for an uncharacterized sequence motif. Through genome-wide reconstitution of physiological chromatin in Drosophila embryo extracts, we uncovered the molecular basis of PNA formation. We identified Phaser, an unstudied zinc finger protein that positions nucleosomes flanking the motif. It also revealed how the global activity of the chromatin remodelers CHRAC/ACF, together with local barrier elements, generates islands of regular phasing throughout the genome. Our work demonstrates the potential of chromatin assembly by embryo extracts as a powerful tool to reconstitute chromatin features on a global scale in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
It is well understood that fatty acids can be synthesized, imported, and modified to meet requisite demands in cells. However, following the movement of fatty acids through the multiplicity of these metabolic steps has remained difficult. To better address this problem, we developed Fatty Acid Source Analysis (FASA), a model that defines the contribution of synthesis, import, and elongation pathways to fatty acid homeostasis in saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acid pools. Application of FASA demonstrated that elongation can be a major contributor to cellular fatty acid content and showed that distinct pro-inflammatory stimuli (e.g., Toll-like receptors 2, 3, or 4) specifically reprogram homeostasis of fatty acids by differential utilization of synthetic and elongation pathways in macrophages. In sum, this modeling approach significantly advances our ability to interrogate cellular fatty acid metabolism and provides insight into how cells dynamically reshape their lipidomes in response to metabolic or inflammatory signals.

Abstract: Summary
Differentiation events contribute to phenotypic cellular heterogeneity within tumors and influence disease progression and response to therapy. Here, we dissect mechanisms controlling intratumoral heterogeneity within triple-negative basal-like breast cancers. Tumor cells expressing the cytokeratin K14 possess a differentiation state that is associated with that of normal luminal progenitors, and K14-negative cells are in a state closer to that of mature luminal cells. We show that cells can transition between these states through asymmetric divisions, which produce one K14+ and one K14− daughter cell, and that these asymmetric divisions contribute to the generation of cellular heterogeneity. We identified several regulators that control the proportion of K14+ cells in the population. EZH2 and Notch increase the numbers of K14+ cells and their rates of symmetric divisions, and FOXA1 has an opposing effect. Our findings demonstrate that asymmetric divisions generate differentiation transitions and heterogeneity, and identify pathways that control breast cancer cellular composition.

Abstract: Summary
Fkbp5 is a widely expressed peptidyl prolyl isomerase that serves as a molecular chaperone through conformational changes of binding partners. Although it regulates diverse protein functions, little is known about its roles in myogenesis. We found here that Fkbp5 plays critical roles in myoblast differentiation through two mechanisms. First, it sequesters Cdk4 within the Hsp90 storage complex and prevents the formation of the cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex, which is a major inhibitor of differentiation. Second, Fkbp5 promotes cis-trans isomerization of the Thr172-Pro173 peptide bond in Cdk4 and inhibits phosphorylation of Thr172, an essential step for Cdk4 activation. Consistent with these in vitro findings, muscle regeneration is delayed in Fkbp5−/− mice. The related protein Fkbp4 also sequesters Cdk4 within the Hsp90 complex but does not isomerize Cdk4 or induce Thr173 phosphorylation despite its highly similar sequence. This study demonstrates protein isomerization as a critical regulatory mechanism of myogenesis by targeting Cdk4.

Abstract: Summary
A challenge in solving the genotype-to-phenotype relationship is to predict a cell’s metabolome, believed to correlate poorly with gene expression. Using comparative quantitative proteomics, we found that differential protein expression in 97 Saccharomyces cerevisiae kinase deletion strains is non-redundant and dominated by abundance changes in metabolic enzymes. Associating differential enzyme expression landscapes to corresponding metabolomes using network models provided reasoning for poor proteome-metabolome correlations; differential protein expression redistributes flux control between many enzymes acting in concert, a mechanism not captured by one-to-one correlation statistics. Mapping these regulatory patterns using machine learning enabled the prediction of metabolite concentrations, as well as identification of candidate genes important for the regulation of metabolism. Overall, our study reveals that a large part of metabolism regulation is explained through coordinated enzyme expression changes. Our quantitative data indicate that this mechanism explains more than half of metabolism regulation and underlies the interdependency between enzyme levels and metabolism, which renders the metabolome a predictable phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
The balance of dopamine and acetylcholine in the dorsal striatum is critical for motor and learning functions. Midbrain dopamine cells and local cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) densely innervate the striatum and have strong reciprocal actions on each other. Although dopamine inputs regulate ChIs, the functional consequences of dopamine neuron activity across dorsal striatal regions is poorly understood. Here, we find that midbrain dopamine neurons drive pauses in the firing of dorsomedial ChIs but robust bursts in dorsolateral ChIs. Pauses are mediated by dopamine D2 receptors, while bursts are driven by glutamate corelease and activation of a mGluR-mediated excitatory conductance. We find the frequency of muscarinic cholinergic transmission to medium spiny neurons is greater in the dorsomedial striatum. This regional variation in transmission is moderated by the different actions of dopamine and glutamate corelease. These results delineate a mechanism by which dopamine inputs maintain consistent levels of cholinergic activity across the dorsal striatum.

Abstract: Summary
Box C/D snoRNAs constitute a class of abundant noncoding RNAs that associate with common core proteins to form catalytic snoRNPs. Most of these operate in trans to assist the maturation of rRNAs by guiding and catalyzing the 2′-O-methylation of specific nucleotides. Here, we report that the human intron-hosted box C/D snoRNA snoRD86 acts in cis as a sensor and master switch controlling levels of the limiting snoRNP core protein NOP56, which is important for proper ribosome biogenesis. Our results support a model in which snoRD86 adopts different RNP conformations that dictate the usage of nearby alternative splice donors in the NOP56 pre-mRNA. Excess snoRNP core proteins prevent further production of NOP56 and instead trigger the generation of a cytoplasmic snoRD86-containing NOP56-derived lncRNA via the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. Our findings reveal a feedback mechanism based on RNA structure that controls the precise coordination between box C/D snoRNP core proteins and global snoRNA levels.

Abstract: Summary
Intra-tumor heterogeneity caused by clonal evolution is a major problem in cancer treatment. To address this problem, we performed label-free quantitative proteomics on primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. We identified 50 leukemia-enriched plasma membrane proteins enabling the prospective isolation of genetically distinct subclones from individual AML patients. Subclones differed in their regulatory phenotype, drug sensitivity, growth, and engraftment behavior, as determined by RNA sequencing, DNase I hypersensitive site mapping, transcription factor occupancy analysis, in vitro culture, and xenograft transplantation. Finally, we show that these markers can be used to identify and longitudinally track distinct leukemic clones in patients in routine diagnostics. Our study describes a strategy for a major improvement in stratifying cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Cryptococcus is the most important cause of fungal meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. Host defense against Cryptococcus involves direct killing by NK cells. That NK cells from HIV-infected patients fail to polarize perforin to the microbial synapse and kill C. neoformans led us to explore the mechanisms used to reposition and polarize the cytolytic granules to the synapse. Using live-cell imaging, we observed microtubule and granule movements in response to Cryptococcus that revealed a kinesin-dependent event. Eg5-kinesin bound to perforin-containing granules and was required for association with the microtubules. Inhibition of Eg5-kinesin abrogated dynein-dependent granule convergence to the MTOC and granule and MTOC polarization to the synapse and suppressed NK cell killing of Cryptococcus. In contrast, Eg5-kinesin was dispensable for tumor killing. This reveals an alternative mechanism of MTOC repositioning and granule polarization, not used in tumor cytotoxicity, in which Eg5-kinesin is required to initiate granule movement, leading to microbial killing.

Abstract: IκB, a cytoplasmic inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), is reportedly degraded via the proteasome. However, we recently found that long-term incubation with proteasome inhibitors (PIs) such as PS-341 or MG132 induces IκBα degradation via an alternative pathway, lysosome, which results in NF-κB activation and confers resistance to PI-induced lung cancer cell death. To enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of PIs, elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of PI-induced IκBα degradation is necessary. Here, we demonstrated that PI upregulates nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) via both de novo protein synthesis and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) degradation, which is responsible for IκBα degradation via macroautophagy activation. PIs increased the protein level of light chain 3B (LC3B, macroautophagy marker), but not lysosome-associated membrane protein 2a (Lamp2a, the receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy) in NCI-H157 and A549 lung cancer cells. Pretreatment with macroautophagy inhibitor or knock-down of LC3B blocked PI-induced IκBα degradation. PIs up-regulated Nrf2 by increasing its transcription and mediating degradation of KEAP1 (cytoplasmic inhibitor of Nrf2). Overexpression of dominant-negative Nrf2, which lacks an N-terminal transactivating domain, or knock-down of Nrf2 suppressed PI-induced LC3B protein expression and subsequent IκBα degradation. Thus, blocking of the Nrf2 pathway enhanced PI-induced cell death. These findings suggest that Nrf2-driven induction of LC3B plays an essential role in PI-induced activation of the IκB/NF-κB pathway, which attenuates the anti-tumor efficacy of PIs.

Abstract: Summary
The aberrant regulation of Wnt secretion is implicated in various neurological diseases. However, the mechanisms of Wnt release are still largely unknown. Here we describe the role of a C. elegans tetraspan protein, HIC-1, in maintaining normal Wnt release. We show that HIC-1 is expressed in cholinergic synapses and that mutants in hic-1 show increased levels of the acetylcholine receptor AChR/ACR-16. Our results suggest that HIC-1 maintains normal AChR/ACR-16 levels by regulating normal Wnt release from presynaptic neurons, as hic-1 mutants show an increase in secreted Wnt from cholinergic neurons. We further show that HIC-1 affects Wnt secretion by modulating the actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with the actin-binding protein NAB-1. In summary, we describe a protein, HIC-1, that functions as a neuromodulator by affecting postsynaptic AChR/ACR-16 levels by regulating presynaptic Wnt release from cholinergic motor neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is an innate immune receptor for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and has important roles in infectious diseases. We previously reported that TLR7 shows synergistic activation in response to two ligands, guanosine and ssRNA. However, the specific ssRNA sequence preference, detailed recognition mode of TLR7 and its ligand, and molecular determinants of TLR7 and TLR8 selectivity remain unknown. Here, we report on TLR7 from a large-scale crystallographic study combined with a multifaceted approach. We reveal that successive uridine-containing ssRNAs fully or moderately bind TLR7, whereas single uridine-containing ssRNAs have reduced affinities. We also reveal the detailed relationships between the chemical structures of ligands and their binding to TLR7. We demonstrate that an engineered TLR8 mutant alters its responsiveness to TLR7-specific ligands. Finally, we identify guanosine 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (2′,3′-cGMP) as a possible endogenous ligand for TLR7 with greater affinity than guanosine. The abundant structural information will facilitate future development of treatments targeting TLR7.

Abstract: Summary
The induction of limb repair in adult vertebrates is a pressing, unsolved problem. Here, we characterize the effects of an integrated device that delivers drugs to severed hindlimbs of adult Xenopus laevis, which normally regenerate cartilaginous spikes after amputation. A wearable bioreactor containing a silk protein-based hydrogel that delivered progesterone to the wound site immediately after hindlimb amputation for only 24 hr induced the regeneration of paddle-like structures in adult frogs. Molecular markers, morphometric analysis, X-ray imaging, immunofluorescence, and behavioral assays were used to characterize the differences between the paddle-like structures of successful regenerates and hypomorphic spikes that grew in untreated animals. Our experiments establish a model for testing therapeutic cocktails in vertebrate hindlimb regeneration, identify pro-regenerative activities of progesterone-containing bioreactors, and provide proof of principle of brief use of integrated device-based delivery of small-molecule drugs as a viable strategy to induce and maintain a long-term regenerative response.

Abstract: The Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) is an endemic rare crocodilian species in China. In this study, we investigated the cytochemical patterns of peripheral blood cells in Chinese alligators for the first time by a range of cytochemical staining techniques including periodic acid-Schiff(PAS), sudan black B(SBB), peroxidase(POX), alkaline phosphatase(AKP), acid phosphatase(ACP), chloroacetic acid AS-D naphthol esterase(AS-D) and α-naphthol acetate esterase(α-NAE) staining. Erythrocytes were positive for PAS, and negative for all the other staining; heterophils were strongly positive for SBB, POX, ACP, AKP, AS-D and α-NAE, while weakly positive for PAS staining; eosinophils were strongly positive for PAS, POX, AKP, ACP and AS-D, and weakly positive for SBB and α-NAE staining; basophils were strongly positive for PAS, positive for POX, ACP, AKP and α-NAE, and weakly positive for AS-D, while negative for SBB staining; monocytes were weakly positive for PAS, ACP, AKP and α-NAE, while negative for SBB, POX and AS-D staining; lymphocytes were weakly positive for PAS and α-NAE, negative for all the other staining; thrombocytes were weakly positive for PAS, and negative for all the other staining. Our results add up knowledge about Chinese alligator blood cells.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogenesis is a complex and dynamic cellular differentiation process critical to male reproduction and sustained by spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Although patterns of gene expression have been described for aggregates of certain spermatogenic cell types, the full continuum of gene expression patterns underlying ongoing spermatogenesis in steady state was previously unclear. Here, we catalog single-cell transcriptomes for >62,000 individual spermatogenic cells from immature (postnatal day 6) and adult male mice and adult men. This allowed us to resolve SSC and progenitor spermatogonia, elucidate the full range of gene expression changes during male meiosis and spermiogenesis, and derive unique gene expression signatures for multiple mouse and human spermatogenic cell types and/or subtypes. These transcriptome datasets provide an information-rich resource for studies of SSCs, male meiosis, testicular cancer, male infertility, or contraceptive development, as well as a gene expression roadmap to be emulated in efforts to achieve spermatogenesis in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
The blood-brain barrier is crucial for nervous system function. It is established early during development and stays intact during growth of the brain. In invertebrates, septate junctions are the occluding junctions of this barrier. Here, we used Drosophila to address how septate junctions grow during larval stages when brain size increases dramatically. We show that septate junctions are preassembled as long, highly folded strands during embryonic stages, connecting cell vertices. During subsequent cell growth, these corrugated strands are stretched out and stay intact during larval life with very little protein turnover. The G-protein coupled receptor Moody orchestrates the continuous organization of junctional strands in a process requiring F-actin. Consequently, in moody mutants, septate junction strands cannot properly stretch out during cell growth. To compensate for the loss of blood-brain barrier function, moody mutants form interdigitating cell-cell protrusions, resembling the evolutionary ancient barrier type found in primitive vertebrates or invertebrates such as cuttlefish.

Abstract: Summary
Upon vacuolar lysosome (or vacuole) fusion in S. cerevisiae, a portion of membrane is internalized and catabolized. Formation of this intralumenal fragment (ILF) is important for organelle protein and lipid homeostasis and remodeling. But how ILF formation is optimized for membrane turnover is not understood. Here, we show that fewer ILFs form when the interaction between the Rab-GTPase Ypt7 and its effector Vps41 (a subunit of the tethering complex HOPS) is interrupted by a point mutation (Ypt7-D44N). Subsequent phosphorylation of Vps41 by the casein kinase Yck3 prevents stabilization of trans-SNARE complexes needed for lipid bilayer pore formation. Impairing ILF formation prevents clearance of misfolded proteins from vacuole membranes and promotes organelle permeability and cell death. We propose that HOPS coordinates Rab, kinase, and SNARE cycles to modulate ILF size during vacuole fusion, regulating lipid and protein turnover important for quality control and membrane integrity.

Abstract: Summary
To assess the utility of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as an in vitro proarrhythmia model, we evaluated the concentration dependence and sources of variability of electrophysiologic responses to 28 drugs linked to low, intermediate, and high torsades de pointes (TdP) risk categories using two commercial cell lines and standardized protocols in a blinded multisite study using multielectrode array or voltage-sensing optical approaches. Logistical and ordinal linear regression models were constructed using drug responses as predictors and TdP risk categories as outcomes. Three of seven predictors (drug-induced arrhythmia-like events and prolongation of repolarization at either maximum tested or maximal clinical exposures) categorized drugs with reasonable accuracy (area under the curve values of receiver operator curves ∼0.8). hiPSC-CM line, test site, and platform had minimal influence on drug categorization. These results demonstrate the utility of hiPSC-CMs to detect drug-induced proarrhythmic effects as part of the evolving Comprehensive In Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay paradigm.

Abstract: Summary
Neural population space analysis was performed to assess the dimensionality and dynamics of the neural population in the primary motor cortex (M1) during a reach-grasp-manipulation task in which both the reach location and the object being grasped were varied. We partitioned neural activity into three components: (1) general task-related activity independent of location and object, (2) location- and/or object-related activity, and (3) noise. Neural modulation related to location and/or object was only one-third the size of either general task modulation or noise. The neural dimensions of location and/or object-related activity overlapped with both the general task and noise dimensions. Rather than large amplitude modulation in a fixed set of dimensions, the active dimensions of location and/or object modulation shifted progressively over the time course of a trial.

Abstract: The central mechanisms coordinating growth and sexual maturation are well conserved across invertebrates and vertebrates. Although mutations in the gene encoding makorin RING finger protein 3 (mkrn3) are associated with central precocious puberty in humans, a causal relationship has not been elucidated. Here, we examined the role of mkrn1, a Drosophila ortholog of mammalian makorin genes, in the regulation of developmental timing. Loss of MKRN1 in mkrn1exS prolonged the 3rd instar stage and delayed the onset of pupariation, resulting in bigger size pupae. MKRN1 was expressed in the prothoracic gland, where the steroid hormone ecdysone is produced. Furthermore, mkrn1exS larvae exhibited reduced mRNA levels of phantom, which encodes ecdysone-synthesizing enzyme and E74, which is a downstream target of ecdysone. Collectively, these results indicate that MKRN1 fine-tunes developmental timing and sexual maturation by affecting ecdysone synthesis in Drosophila. Moreover, our study supports the notion that malfunction of makorin gene family member, mkrn3 dysregulates the timing of puberty in mammals.

Abstract: Summary
Many organisms need to respond to complex, noisy environmental signals for developmental decision making. Here, we dissect how Arabidopsis plants integrate widely fluctuating field temperatures over month-long timescales to progressively upregulate VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3 (VIN3) and silence FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), aligning flowering with spring. We develop a mathematical model for vernalization that operates on multiple timescales—long term (month), short term (day), and current (hour)—and is constrained by experimental data. Our analysis demonstrates that temperature sensing is not localized to specific nodes within the FLC network. Instead, temperature sensing is broadly distributed, with each thermosensory process responding to specific features of the plants’ history of exposure to warm and cold. The model accurately predicts FLC silencing in new field data, allowing us to forecast FLC expression in changing climates. We suggest that distributed thermosensing may be a general property of thermoresponsive regulatory networks in complex natural environments.

Abstract: Summary
Temporospatial regulation of guidance signaling is essential for axon outgrowth and pathfinding in the developing nervous system. Regulation of Robo1 levels in commissural neurons modulates Slit sensitivity facilitating proper axon guidance. The mechanisms underlying this regulation in the vertebrate nervous system are not well understood. Here, we report that miR-92, a highly conserved microRNA (miRNA), regulates chicken Robo1 expression in commissural neurons by binding to the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of Robo1 mRNA. miR-92 and Robo1 are differentially expressed in the developing spinal cord. miR-92 interacts with the Robo1 3′UTR to cause translational repression, but not mRNA degradation. Disruption of the miR-92/Robo1 3′ UTR interaction induces premature responsiveness to Slit2 repulsion of precrossing commissural axons (CAs) in vitro and causes CA projection defects in vivo. These results indicate that miR-92 represses Robo1 expression thereby regulating Slit sensitivity to control CA projection and midline crossing.

Abstract: Summary
The immune system is highly diverse, but characterization of its genetic architecture has lagged behind the vast progress made by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of emergent diseases. Our GWAS for 54 functionally relevant phenotypes of the adaptive immune system in 489 healthy individuals identifies eight genome-wide significant associations explaining 6%–20% of variance. Coding and splicing variants in PTPRC and COMMD10 are involved in memory T cell differentiation. Genetic variation controlling disease-relevant T helper cell subsets includes RICTOR and STON2 associated with Th2 and Th17, respectively, and the interferon-lambda locus controlling regulatory T cell proliferation. Early and memory B cell differentiation stages are associated with variation in LARP1B and SP4. Finally, the latrophilin family member ADGRL2 correlates with baseline pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 levels. Suggestive associations reveal mechanisms of autoimmune disease associations, in particular related to pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Pinpointing these key human immune regulators offers attractive therapeutic perspectives.

Abstract: Summary
Myogenic differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has been done by gene overexpression or directed differentiation. However, viral integration, long-term culture, and the presence of unwanted cells are the main obstacles. By using CRISPR/Cas9n, a double-reporter human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line was generated for PAX7/MYF5, allowing prospective readout. This strategy allowed pathway screen to define efficient myogenic induction in hPSCs. Next, surface marker screen allowed identification of CD10 and CD24 for purification of myogenic progenitors and exclusion of non-myogenic cells. CD10 expression was also identified on human satellite cells and skeletal muscle progenitors. In vitro and in vivo studies using transgene and/or reporter-free hPSCs further validated myogenic potential of the cells by formation of new fibers expressing human dystrophin as well as donor-derived satellite cells in NSG-mdx4Cv mice. This study provides biological insights for myogenic differentiation of hPSCs using a double-reporter cell resource and defines an improved myogenic differentiation and purification strategy.

Abstract: The CRISPR-Cas system is a well-established RNA-guided DNA editing technique widely used to modify genomic DNA sequences. I used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to change the second and third nucleotides of the triplet TCT of human TNSFSF9 in HepG2 cells to TAG to create an amber stop codon. The TCT triplet is the codon for Ser at the 172nd position of TNSFSF9. The two substituted nucleotides, AG, were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the PCR product followed by PCR amplification of the genomic TNFSF9 gene. Interestingly, sequencing of the cDNA of transcripts of the edited TNFSF9 gene revealed that the TAG had been re-edited to the wild type triplet TCT, and 1 or 2 bases just before the triplet had been deleted. These observations indicate that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated editing of bases in target genomic DNA can be followed by spontaneous re-editing (correcting) of the bases during transcription.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to select the most salient among competing stimuli is essential for animal behavior and operates no matter which spatial locations stimuli happen to occupy. We provide evidence that the brain employs a combinatorially optimized inhibition strategy for selection across all pairs of stimulus locations. With experiments in a key inhibitory nucleus in the vertebrate midbrain selection network, called isthmi pars magnocellularis (Imc) in owls, we discovered that Imc neurons encode visual space with receptive fields that have multiple excitatory hot spots (“lobes”). Such multilobed encoding is necessitated by scarcity of Imc neurons. Although distributed seemingly randomly, the locations of these lobes are optimized across the high-firing Imc neurons, allowing them to combinatorially solve selection across space. This strategy minimizes metabolic and wiring costs, a principle that also accounts for observed asymmetries between azimuthal and elevational coding. Combinatorially optimized inhibition may be a general neural principle for efficient stimulus selection.

Abstract: Summary
Unc-51-like-kinase 1 (ULK1) is a target of both the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), whose role is to facilitate the initiation of autophagy in response to starvation. Upon glucose starvation, dissociation of mTOR from ULK1 and phosphorylation by AMPK leads to the activation of ULK1 activity. Here, we provide evidence that ULK1 is the attachment of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylated) on the threonine 754 site by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) upon glucose starvation. ULK1 O-GlcNAcylation occurs after dephosphorylation of adjacent mTOR-dependent phosphorylation on the serine 757 site by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and phosphorylation by AMPK. ULK1 O-GlcNAcylation is crucial for binding and phosphorylation of ATG14L, allowing the activation of lipid kinase VPS34 and leading to the production of phosphatidylinositol-(3)-phosphate (PI(3)P), which is required for phagophore formation and initiation of autophagy. Our findings provide insights into the crosstalk between dephosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation during autophagy and specify a molecular framework for potential therapeutic intervention in autophagy-related diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Productive splicing of human precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) requires the correct selection of authentic splice sites (SS) from the large pool of potential SS. Although SS consensus sequence and splicing regulatory proteins are known to influence SS usage, the mechanisms ensuring the effective suppression of cryptic SS are insufficiently explored. Here, we find that many aberrant exonic SS are efficiently silenced by the exon junction complex (EJC), a multi-protein complex that is deposited on spliced mRNA near the exon-exon junction. Upon depletion of EJC proteins, cryptic SS are de-repressed, leading to the mis-splicing of a broad set of mRNAs. Mechanistically, the EJC-mediated recruitment of the splicing regulator RNPS1 inhibits cryptic 5′SS usage, while the deposition of the EJC core directly masks reconstituted 3′SS, thereby precluding transcript disintegration. Thus, the EJC protects the transcriptome of mammalian cells from inadvertent loss of exonic sequences and safeguards the expression of intact, full-length mRNAs.

Abstract: Spermatogenesis in the freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera laevis was investigated using light and electron microscopy. The testes of M. laevis are composed of numerous acini. We observed type A spermatogonia, large cells of irregular shape, solely near the acinus basal lamina. Type A spermatogonia proliferate and become type B spermatogonia, which are also irregular in shape and form clusters of germ cells of the same developmental stage. The numerous clusters differ with respect to developmental stage and are arranged randomly along the acinus periphery. The central region of the acinus was observed to contain only mature spermatozoa. This germ cell arrangement contrasts that of other bivalvians and may be characteristic of Margaritiferidae and Unionidae. We noted that each germ cell cluster is entirely covered throughout spermatogenesis by Sertoli cells that are loosely bound together. This report is the first to describe the involvement of Sertoli cells in Unionoidea spermatogenesis. Mature spermatozoa of M. laevis are of the primitive sperm type, having a cylindrical head with a discoidal acrosome and a midpiece with five spherical mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
Molecular and behavioral responses to opioids are thought to be primarily mediated by neurons, although there is accumulating evidence that other cell types play a prominent role in drug addiction. To investigate cell-type-specific opioid responses, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the nucleus accumbens of mice following acute morphine treatment. Differential expression analysis uncovered unique morphine-dependent transcriptional responses by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. We examined the expression of selected genes, including Cdkn1a and Sgk1, by FISH, confirming their induction by morphine in oligodendrocytes. Further analysis using RNA-seq of FACS-purified oligodendrocytes revealed a large cohort of morphine-regulated genes. The affected genes are enriched for roles in cellular pathways intimately linked to oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, including the unfolded protein response. Altogether, our data illuminate the morphine-dependent transcriptional response by oligodendrocytes and offer mechanistic insights into myelination defects associated with opioid abuse.

Abstract: Summary
How general anesthesia causes loss of consciousness has been a mystery for decades. It is generally thought that arousal-related brain nuclei, including the locus coeruleus (LC), are involved. Here, by monitoring locomotion behaviors and neural activities, we developed a larval zebrafish model for studying general anesthesia induced by propofol and etomidate, two commonly used intravenous anesthetics. Local lesion of LC neurons via two-photon laser-based ablation or genetic depletion of norepinephrine (NE; a neuromodulator released by LC neurons) via CRISPR/Cas9-based mutation of dopamine-β-hydroxylase (dbh) accelerates induction into and retards emergence from general anesthesia. Mechanistically, in vivo whole-cell recording revealed that both anesthetics suppress LC neurons’ activity through a cooperative mechanism, inhibiting presynaptic excitatory inputs and inducing GABAA receptor-mediated hyperpolarization of these neurons. Thus, our study indicates that the LC-NE system plays a modulatory role in both induction of and emergence from intravenous general anesthesia.

Nonlinear relationship between ER Ca2+ depletion versus induction of the unfolded protein response, autophagy inhibition, and cell death,

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ depletion activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), inhibits bulk autophagy and eventually induces cell death in mammalian cells. However, the extent and duration of ER Ca2+ depletion required is unknown. We instigated a detailed study in two different cell lines, using sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitors to gradually reduce ER Ca2+ levels in a controlled manner. Remarkably, UPR induction (as assessed by expression analyses of UPR-regulated proteins) and autophagy inhibition (as assessed by analyses of effects on starvation-induced bulk autophagy) required substantially higher drug concentrations than those needed to strongly decrease total ER Ca2+ levels. In fact, even when ER Ca2+ levels were so low that we could hardly detect any release of Ca2+ upon challenge with ER Ca2+ purging agents, UPR was not induced, and starvation-induced bulk autophagy was still fully supported. Moreover, although we observed reduced cell proliferation at this very low level of ER Ca2+, cells could tolerate prolonged periods (days) without succumbing to cell death. Addition of increasing concentrations of extracellular EGTA also gradually depleted the ER of Ca2+, and, as with the SERCA inhibitors, EGTA-induced activation of UPR and cell death required higher EGTA concentrations than those needed to strongly reduce ER Ca2+ levels. We conclude that ER Ca2+ depletion-induced effects on UPR, autophagy and cell death require either an extreme general depletion of ER Ca2+ levels, or Ca2+ depletion in areas of the ER that have a higher resistance to Ca2+ drainage than the bulk of the ER.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
The aim of this study was to describe the morphology of the tongue in the aardvark (Orycteropus afer). The tongues from one adult and one three-week old aardvark females and one neonate aardvark were studied. The tongue was elongated in the adult and young aardvarks and had a triangular apex in the rostral part of the tongue. Its dorsal surface was covered by numerous papillae divided into mechanical papillae, present in the form of abundant conical or drop-like filiform papillae, and taste papillae in the form of numerous fungiform papillae and three vallate papillae arranged in a V-shape in the caudal part of the tongue (one papilla was located centrally and caudally with respect to the remaining two papillae). The vallate papillae were round with conical pseudopapillae on their surface. They were surrounded by an annular pad, which was formed by filiform papillae with conical tip. Numerous openings of barrel-shaped taste buds were present in the epithelium covering the surface of fungiform papillae, and in the epithelium of inner walls of the vallate papillae. The serous von Ebner`s glands were located beneath the vallate papillae. The mucoserous Weber`s glands were PAS, AB pH2.5, pH1.0 and AB/PAS positive and HDI-weakly positive.

Abstract: Summary
Centromeric chromatin defines the site of kinetochore formation and ensures faithful chromosome segregation. Centromeric identity is epigenetically specified by the incorporation of CENP-A nucleosomes. DNA replication presents a challenge for inheritance of centromeric identity because nucleosomes are removed to allow for replication fork progression. Despite this challenge, CENP-A nucleosomes are stably retained through S phase. We used BioID to identify proteins transiently associated with CENP-A during DNA replication. We found that during S phase, HJURP transiently associates with centromeres and binds to pre-existing CENP-A, suggesting a distinct role for HJURP in CENP-A retention. We demonstrate that HJURP is required for centromeric nucleosome inheritance during S phase. HJURP co-purifies with the MCM2-7 helicase complex and, together with the MCM2 subunit, binds CENP-A simultaneously. Therefore, pre-existing CENP-A nucleosomes require an S phase function of the HJURP chaperone and interaction with MCM2 to ensure faithful inheritance of centromere identity through DNA replication.

Abstract: Summary
The relationship between promoter proximal transcription factor-associated gene expression and super-enhancer-driven transcriptional programs are not well defined. However, their distinct genomic occupancy suggests a mechanism for specific and separable gene control. We explored the transcriptional and functional interrelationship between E2F transcription factors and BET transcriptional co-activators in multiple myeloma. We found that the transcription factor E2F1 and its heterodimerization partner DP1 represent a dependency in multiple myeloma cells. Global chromatin analysis reveals distinct regulatory axes for E2F and BETs, with E2F predominantly localized to active gene promoters of growth and/or proliferation genes and BETs disproportionately at enhancer-regulated tissue-specific genes. These two separate gene regulatory axes can be simultaneously targeted to impair the myeloma proliferative program, providing an important molecular mechanism for combination therapy. This study therefore suggests a sequestered cellular functional control that may be perturbed in cancer with potential for development of a promising therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
The fidelity of transcription initiation is essential for accurate gene expression, but the determinants of start site selection are not fully understood. Rap1 and other general regulatory factors (GRFs) control the expression of many genes in yeast. We show that depletion of these factors induces widespread ectopic transcription initiation within promoters. This generates many novel non-coding RNAs and transcript isoforms with diverse stability, drastically altering the coding potential of the transcriptome. Ectopic transcription initiation strongly correlates with altered nucleosome positioning. We provide evidence that Rap1 can suppress ectopic initiation by a “place-holder” mechanism whereby it physically occludes inappropriate sites for pre-initiation complex formation. These results reveal an essential role for GRFs in the fidelity of transcription initiation and in the suppression of pervasive transcription, profoundly redefining current models for their function. They have important implications for the mechanism of transcription initiation and the control of gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
The TET2 DNA dioxygenase regulates gene expression by catalyzing demethylation of 5-methylcytosine, thus epigenetically modulating the genome. TET2 does not contain a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain, and how it is recruited to specific genomic sites is not fully understood. Here we carried out a mammalian two-hybrid screen and identified multiple transcriptional regulators potentially interacting with TET2. The SMAD nuclear interacting protein 1 (SNIP1) physically interacts with TET2 and bridges TET2 to bind several transcription factors, including c-MYC. SNIP1 recruits TET2 to the promoters of c-MYC target genes, including those involved in DNA damage response and cell viability. TET2 protects cells from DNA damage-induced apoptosis dependending on SNIP1. Our observations uncover a mechanism for targeting TET2 to specific promoters through a ternary interaction with a co-activator and many sequence-specific DNA-binding factors. This study also reveals a TET2-SNIP1-c-MYC pathway in mediating DNA damage response, thereby connecting epigenetic control to maintenance of genome stability.

Abstract: Summary
Antibodies that bind residue K169 in the V2 region of the HIV-1 envelope correlated with reduced risk of infection in the RV144 vaccine trial but were restricted to two ED-motif-encoding light chain genes. Here, we identify an HIV-infected donor with high-titer V2 peptide-binding antibodies and isolate two antibody lineages (CAP228-16H/19F and CAP228-3D) that mediate potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Both lineages use the IGHV5-51 heavy chain germline gene, similar to the RV144 antibody CH58, but one lineage (CAP228-16H/19F) uses a light chain without the ED motif. A cocrystal structure of CAP228-16H bound to a V2 peptide identified a IGLV3-21 gene-encoded DDxD motif that is used to bind K169, with a mechanism that allows CAP228-16H to recognize more globally relevant V2 immunotypes. Overall, these data further our understanding of the development of cross-reactive, V2-binding, antiviral antibodies and effectively expand the human light chain repertoire able to respond to RV144-like immunogens.

Abstract: Summary
Cell shape is known to influence the plane of cell division. In vitro, mechanical constraints can also orient mitoses; however, in vivo it is not clear whether tension can orient the mitotic spindle directly, because tissue-scale forces can change cell shape. During segmentation of the Drosophila embryo, actomyosin is enriched along compartment boundaries forming supracellular cables that keep cells segregated into distinct compartments. Here, we show that these actomyosin cables orient the planar division of boundary cells perpendicular to the boundaries. This bias overrides the influence of cell shape, when cells are mildly elongated. By decreasing actomyosin cable tension with laser ablation or, conversely, ectopically increasing tension with laser wounding, we demonstrate that local tension is necessary and sufficient to orient mitoses in vivo. This involves capture of the spindle pole by the actomyosin cortex. These findings highlight the importance of actomyosin-mediated tension in spindle orientation in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Eukaryotic cells use copious measures to ensure accurate duplication of the genome. Various genotoxic agents pose threats to the ongoing replication fork that, if not efficiently dealt with, can result in replication fork collapse. It is unknown how replication fork is precisely controlled and regulated under different conditions. Here, we examined the complexity of replication fork composition upon DNA damage by using a PCNA-based proteomic screen to uncover known and unexplored players involved in replication and replication stress response. We used camptothecin or UV radiation, which lead to fork-blocking lesions, to establish a comprehensive proteomics map of the replisome under such replication stress conditions. We identified and examined two potential candidate proteins WIZ and SALL1 for their roles in DNA replication and replication stress response. In addition, our unbiased screen uncovered many prospective candidate proteins that help fill the knowledge gap in understanding chromosomal DNA replication and DNA repair.

Abstract: Summary
DNA polymerase stalling activates the ATR checkpoint kinase, which in turn suppresses fork collapse and breakage. Herein, we describe use of ATR inhibition (ATRi) as a means to identify genomic sites of problematic DNA replication in murine and human cells. Over 500 high-resolution ATR-dependent sites were ascertained using two distinct methods: replication protein A (RPA)-chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and breaks identified by TdT labeling (BrITL). The genomic feature most strongly associated with ATR dependence was repetitive DNA that exhibited high structure-forming potential. Repeats most reliant on ATR for stability included structure-forming microsatellites, inverted retroelement repeats, and quasi-palindromic AT-rich repeats. Notably, these distinct categories of repeats differed in the structures they formed and their ability to stimulate RPA accumulation and breakage, implying that the causes and character of replication fork collapse under ATR inhibition can vary in a DNA-structure-specific manner. Collectively, these studies identify key sources of endogenous replication stress that rely on ATR for stability.

Abstract: Summary
Non-coding RNAs regulate many biological processes including neurogenesis. The brain-enriched miR-124 has been assigned as a key player of neuronal differentiation via its complex but little understood regulation of thousands of annotated targets. To systematically chart its regulatory functions, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to disrupt all six miR-124 alleles in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Upon neuronal induction, miR-124-deleted cells underwent neurogenesis and became functional neurons, albeit with altered morphology and neurotransmitter specification. Using RNA-induced-silencing-complex precipitation, we identified 98 high-confidence miR-124 targets, of which some directly led to decreased viability. By performing advanced transcription-factor-network analysis, we identified indirect miR-124 effects on apoptosis, neuronal subtype differentiation, and the regulation of previously uncharacterized zinc finger transcription factors. Our data emphasize the need for combined experimental- and system-level analyses to comprehensively disentangle and reveal miRNA functions, including their involvement in the neurogenesis of diverse neuronal cell types found in the human brain.

Abstract: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes long-term disability and has no effective clinical treatment. After SCI, extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) leads to an influx of extracellular Ca2+, and this Ca2+ overload causes neuronal toxicosis and apoptosis. The biological functions of leptin have been widely investigated in the central nervous system. In this study, we discovered that the administration of leptin could improve locomotor recovery following SCI. The aim of this study was to determine the neuroprotective mechanism of leptin in vivo and in vitro. The neuronal apoptosis and Ca2+ imaging signal induced by ATP were suppressed by leptin, due to elevated caveolin-1 expression. In vivo two-photon observations revealed that leptin reduced the neuronal Ca2+ imaging signal in the exposed spinal cords of live Thy1-YFP mice. In conclusion, leptin promotes locomotor functional recovery and suppresses neuronal impairment after SCI, suggesting that leptin has a promising clinical therapeutic value for treatment of SCI.

Abstract: Summary
The diversity and number of species present within microbial communities create the potential for a multitude of interspecies metabolic interactions. Here, we develop, apply, and experimentally test a framework for inferring metabolic mechanisms associated with interspecies interactions. We perform pairwise growth and metabolome profiling of co-cultures of strains from a model mouse microbiota. We then apply our framework to dissect emergent metabolic behaviors that occur in co-culture. Based on one of the inferences from this framework, we identify and interrogate an amino acid cross-feeding interaction and validate that the proposed interaction leads to a growth benefit in vitro. Our results reveal the type and extent of emergent metabolic behavior in microbial communities composed of gut microbes. We focus on growth-modulating interactions, but the framework can be applied to interspecies interactions that modulate any phenotype of interest within microbial communities.

Abstract: Summary
Despite burgeoning evidence demonstrating the adaptive properties of natural killer (NK) cells, mechanistic data explaining these phenomena are lacking. Following antibody sensitization, NK cells lacking the Fc receptor (FcR) signaling chain (Δg) acquire adaptive features, including robust proliferation, multifunctionality, rapid killing, and mobilization to sites of virus exposure. Using the rhesus macaque model, we demonstrate the systemic distribution of Δg NK cells expressing memory features, including downregulated Helios and Eomes. Furthermore, we find that Δg NK cells abandon typical γ-chain/Syk in lieu of CD3ζ-Zap70 signaling. FCγRIIIa (CD16) density, mucosal homing, and function are all coupled to this alternate signaling, which in itself requires priming by rhesus cytomegalovirus (rhCMV). Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections further expand gut-homing adaptive NK cells but result in pathogenic suppression of CD3ζ-Zap70 signaling and function. Herein, we provide a mechanism of virus-dependent alternative signaling that may explain the acquisition of adaptive features by primate NK cells and could be targeted for future vaccine or curative therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing is crucial for diverse cellular, developmental, and pathological processes. However, the full networks of factors that control individual splicing events are not known. Here, we describe a CRISPR-based strategy for the genome-wide elucidation of pathways that control splicing and apply it to microexons with important functions in nervous system development and that are commonly misregulated in autism. Approximately 200 genes associated with functionally diverse regulatory layers and enriched in genetic links to autism control neuronal microexons. Remarkably, the widely expressed RNA binding proteins Srsf11 and Rnps1 directly, preferentially, and frequently co-activate these microexons. These factors form critical interactions with the neuronal splicing regulator Srrm4 and a bi-partite intronic splicing enhancer element to promote spliceosome formation. Our study thus presents a versatile system for the identification of entire splicing regulatory pathways and further reveals a common mechanism for the definition of neuronal microexons that is disrupted in autism.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation patterns regulate gene expression programs and are maintained through a highly coordinated process orchestrated by the RING E3 ubiquitin ligase UHRF1. UHRF1 controls DNA methylation inheritance by reading epigenetic modifications to histones and DNA to activate histone H3 ubiquitylation. Here, we find that all five domains of UHRF1, including the previously uncharacterized ubiquitin-like domain (UBL), cooperate for hemi-methylated DNA-dependent H3 ubiquitin ligation. Our structural and biochemical studies, including mutations found in cancer genomes, reveal a bifunctional requirement for the UBL in histone modification: (1) the UBL makes an essential interaction with the backside of the E2 and (2) the UBL coordinates with other UHRF1 domains that recognize epigenetic marks on DNA and histone H3 to direct ubiquitin to H3. Finally, we show UBLs from other E3s also have a conserved interaction with the E2, Ube2D, highlighting a potential prevalence of interactions between UBLs and E2s.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium is a key regulator of mitochondrial function under both normal and pathological conditions. The mechanisms linking metabolic activity to mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling remain elusive, however. Here, by monitoring mitochondrial Ca2+ transients while manipulating mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), we found that mild fluctuations in ΔΨm, which do not affect Ca2+ influx, are sufficient to strongly regulate NCLX, the major efflux pathway of Ca2+ from the mitochondria. Phosphorylation of NCLX or expression of phosphomimicking mutant (S258D) rescued NCLX activity from ΔΨm-driven allosteric inhibition. By screening ΔΨm sensitivity of NCLX mutants, we also identified amino acid residues that, through functional interaction with Ser258, control NCLX regulation. Finally, we find that glucose-driven ΔΨm changes in pancreatic β-cells control mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling primarily via NCLX regulation. Our results identify a feedback control between metabolic activity and mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and the “safety valve” NCLX phosphorylation that can rescue Ca2+ efflux in depolarized mitochondria.

Abstract: Summary
Myelin allows for fast and efficient axonal conduction, but much remains to be determined about the mechanisms that regulate myelin formation. To investigate the genetic basis of myelination, we carried out a genetic screen using zebrafish. Here, we show that the lysosomal G protein RagA is essential for CNS myelination. In rraga−/− mutant oligodendrocytes, target genes of the lysosomal transcription factor Tfeb are upregulated, consistent with previous evidence that RagA represses Tfeb activity. Loss of Tfeb function is sufficient to restore myelination in RagA mutants, indicating that hyperactive Tfeb represses myelination. Conversely, tfeb−/− single mutants exhibit ectopic myelin, further indicating that Tfeb represses myelination during development. In a mouse model of de- and remyelination, TFEB expression is increased in oligodendrocytes, but the protein is localized to the cytoplasm, and hence inactive, especially during remyelination. These results define essential regulators of myelination and may advance approaches to therapeutic remyelination.

Abstract: Summary
Monkeys are an optimal model species for developing stem cell therapies. We previously reported generating chimeric cynomolgus monkey fetuses using dome-shaped embryonic stem cells (dESCs). However, conventional primed pluripotent stem cells (pPSCs) lack chimera competency. Here, by altering the media in which injected morulae are cultured, we observed increased survival of cynomolgus monkey primed ESCs, induced PSCs, and somatic cell nuclear transfer-derived ESCs, thereby enabling chimeric contributions with 0.1%–4.5% chimerism into the embryonic and placental tissues, including germ cell progenitors in chimeric monkeys. Mechanically, dESCs and pPSCs belong to different cell types and similarly express epiblast ontogenic genes. The host embryonic microenvironment could reprogram injected PSCs to embryonic-like cells. However, the reprogramming level and chimerism were associated with the cell state of injected PSCs. Our findings provide a method to understand pluripotency and broaden the use of embryonic chimeras for basic developmental biology research and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Aging is accompanied by a pervasive collapse of proteostasis, while reducing general protein synthesis promotes longevity across taxa. Here, we show that the eIF4E isoform IFE-2 is increasingly sequestered in mRNA processing (P) bodies during aging and upon stress in Caenorhabditis elegans. Loss of the enhancer of mRNA decapping EDC-3 causes further entrapment of IFE-2 in P bodies and lowers protein synthesis rates in somatic tissues. Animals lacking EDC-3 are long lived and stress resistant, congruent with IFE-2-deficient mutants. Notably, neuron-specific expression of EDC-3 is sufficient to reverse lifespan extension, while sequestration of IFE-2 in neuronal P bodies counteracts age-related neuronal decline. The effects of mRNA decapping deficiency on stress resistance and longevity are orchestrated by a multimodal stress response involving the transcription factor SKN-1, which mediates lifespan extension upon reduced protein synthesis. Our findings elucidate a mechanism of proteostasis control during aging through P body-mediated regulation of protein synthesis in the soma.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammation-induced disappearance of tissue-resident macrophages represents a key pathogen defense mechanism. Using a model of systemic blood-stage malaria, we studied the dynamics of tissue-resident macrophages in multiple organs to determine how they are depleted and refilled during the course of disease. We show that Plasmodium infection results in a transient loss of embryonically established resident macrophages prior to the parasitemia peak. Fate-mapping analysis reveals that inflammatory monocytes contribute to the repopulation of the emptied niches of splenic red pulp macrophages and hepatic Kupffer cells, while lung alveolar macrophages refill their niche predominantly through self-renewal. Interestingly, the local microenvironment of the spleen and liver can “imprint” the molecular characteristics of fetal-derived macrophages on newly differentiated bone marrow-derived immigrants with remarkably similar gene expression profiles and turnover kinetics. Thus, the mononuclear phagocytic system has developed distinct but effective tissue-specific strategies to replenish emptied niches to guarantee the functional integrity of the system.

Abstract: Summary
Members of the KDM5 histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase family are associated with therapeutic resistance, including endocrine resistance in breast cancer, but the underlying mechanism is poorly defined. Here we show that genetic deletion of KDM5A/B or inhibition of KDM5 activity increases sensitivity to anti-estrogens by modulating estrogen receptor (ER) signaling and by decreasing cellular transcriptomic heterogeneity. Higher KDM5B expression levels are associated with higher transcriptomic heterogeneity and poor prognosis in ER+ breast tumors. Single-cell RNA sequencing, cellular barcoding, and mathematical modeling demonstrate that endocrine resistance is due to selection for pre-existing genetically distinct cells, while KDM5 inhibitor resistance is acquired. Our findings highlight the importance of cellular phenotypic heterogeneity in therapeutic resistance and identify KDM5A/B as key regulators of this process.

Abstract: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have great potentials for regenerative medicine. However, serious concerns such as the use of the viral-mediated reprogramming strategies and exposure of iPSCs to animal products from feeder cells and serum-containing medium have restricted the application of iPSCs in the clinics. Therefore, the generation of iPSCs with minimal viral integrations and in non-animal sourced and serum-free medium is necessary. In this report, a polycistronic lentiviral vector carrying Yamanaka’s factors was used to reprogram mouse fibroblasts into iPSCs in feeder- and xeno-free culture environment. The generated iPSCs exhibited morphology and self-renewal properties of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), expression of specific pluripotent markers, and potentials to differentiate into the three-major distinct specialized germ layers in vitro. The iPSCs were also shown to have the potential to differentiate into neural precursor and neurons in culture, with greater than 95% expression of nestin, Pax6 and βIII-tubulin. This body of work describes an alternative method of generating iPSCs by using polycistronic lentiviral vector that may minimize the risks associated with viral vector-mediated reprogramming and animal derived products in the culture media.

Abstract: Summary
β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) elevation during fasting or caloric restriction is believed to induce anti-aging effects and alleviate aging-related neurodegeneration. However, whether β-HB alters the senescence pathway in vascular cells remains unknown. Here we report that β-HB promotes vascular cell quiescence, which significantly inhibits both stress-induced premature senescence and replicative senescence through p53-independent mechanisms. Further, we identify heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) as a direct binding target of β-HB. β-HB binding to hnRNP A1 markedly enhances hnRNP A1 binding with Octamer-binding transcriptional factor (Oct) 4 mRNA, which stabilizes Oct4 mRNA and Oct4 expression. Oct4 increases Lamin B1, a key factor against DNA damage-induced senescence. Finally, fasting and intraperitoneal injection of β-HB upregulate Oct4 and Lamin B1 in both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells in mice in vivo. We conclude that β-HB exerts anti-aging effects in vascular cells by upregulating an hnRNP A1-induced Oct4-mediated Lamin B1 pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cell (DC) maturation induced by Toll-like receptor agonists requires activation of downstream signal transduction and metabolic changes. The endogenous metabolite citrate has recently emerged as a modulator of DC activation. However, the metabolic requirements that support citrate production remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that p32/C1qbp, which functions as a multifunctional chaperone protein in mitochondria, supports mitochondrial metabolism and DC maturation. Metabolic analysis revealed that the citrate increase induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is impaired in p32-deficient DCs. We also found that p32 interacts with dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (E2 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase [PDH] complex) and positively regulates PDH activity in DCs. Therefore, we suggest that DC maturation is regulated by citrate production via p32-dependent PDH activity. p32-null mice administered a PDH inhibitor show decreased DC maturation and ovalbumin-specific IgG production in vivo, suggesting that p32 may serve as a therapeutic target for DC-related autoimmune diseases.

Abstract: Summary
A hallmark of aging is a decline in metabolic homeostasis, which is attenuated by dietary restriction (DR). However, the interaction of aging and DR with the metabolome is not well understood. We report that DR is a stronger modulator of the rat metabolome than age in plasma and tissues. A comparative metabolomic screen in rodents and humans identified circulating sarcosine as being similarly reduced with aging and increased by DR, while sarcosine is also elevated in long-lived Ames dwarf mice. Pathway analysis in aged sarcosine-replete rats identify this biogenic amine as an integral node in the metabolome network. Finally, we show that sarcosine can activate autophagy in cultured cells and enhances autophagic flux in vivo, suggesting a potential role in autophagy induction by DR. Thus, these data identify circulating sarcosine as a biomarker of aging and DR in mammalians and may contribute to age-related alterations in the metabolome and in proteostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) spreads in populations through a latency entry and reactivation cycle. The role of host immune-suppressive factor regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in controlling latency establishment and reactivation is not completely understood. Here, using an HSV-1 ocular infection murine model, we observe a positive correlation between the level of Treg cells and viral infectivity and demonstrate the requirement for Treg cells in latency establishment. Furthermore, we show that host stress leads to HSV-1 reactivation via increased Treg cell control of CD8+ T cells, permitting viral replication under diminished immune surveillance. Together, we propose that Treg cell regulation may serve as a key target for controlling HSV infection.

Abstract: Summary
Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21) is associated with developmental abnormalities and increased leukemia risk. To reconcile chromatin alterations with transcriptome changes, we performed paired exogenous spike-in normalized RNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in DS models. Absolute normalization unmasks global amplification of gene expression associated with trisomy 21. Overexpression of the nucleosome binding protein HMGN1 (encoded on chr21q22) recapitulates transcriptional changes seen with triplication of a Down syndrome critical region on distal chromosome 21, and HMGN1 is necessary for B cell phenotypes in DS models. Absolute exogenous-normalized chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Rx) also reveals a global increase in histone H3K27 acetylation caused by HMGN1. Transcriptional amplification downstream of HMGN1 is enriched for stage-specific programs of B cells and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, dependent on the developmental cellular context. These data offer a mechanistic explanation for DS transcriptional patterns and suggest that further study of HMGN1 and RNA amplification in diverse DS phenotypes is warranted.

Abstract: Summary
In response to genotoxic stress, cells activate a signaling cascade known as the DNA damage checkpoint (DDC) that leads to a temporary cell cycle arrest and activation of DNA repair mechanisms. Because persistent DDC activation compromises cell viability, this process must be tightly regulated. However, despite its importance, the mechanisms regulating DDC recovery are not completely understood. Here, we identify a DNA-damage-regulated histone modification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phosphorylation of H4 threonine 80 (H4T80ph), and show that it triggers checkpoint inactivation. H4T80ph is critical for cell survival to DNA damage, and its absence causes impaired DDC recovery and persistent cell cycle arrest. We show that, in response to genotoxic stress, p21-activated kinase Cla4 phosphorylates H4T80 to recruit Rtt107 to sites of DNA damage. Rtt107 displaces the checkpoint adaptor Rad9, thereby interrupting the checkpoint-signaling cascade. Collectively, our results indicate that H4T80ph regulates DDC recovery.

Abstract: Summary
Virus infection is sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detecting virus nucleic acids and initiating an innate immune response. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a PRR that binds cytosolic DNA and is antagonized by vaccinia virus (VACV) protein C16. Here, VACV protein C4 is also shown to antagonize DNA-PK by binding to Ku and blocking Ku binding to DNA, leading to a reduced production of cytokines and chemokines in vivo and a diminished recruitment of inflammatory cells. C4 and C16 share redundancy in that a double deletion virus has reduced virulence not seen with single deletion viruses following intradermal infection. However, non-redundant functions exist because both single deletion viruses display attenuated virulence compared to wild-type VACV after intranasal infection. It is notable that VACV expresses two proteins to antagonize DNA-PK, but it is not known to target other DNA sensors, emphasizing the importance of this PRR in the response to infection in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
DNA replication is initiated by assembly of the kinase cell division cycle 7 (CDC7) with its regulatory activation subunit, activator of S-phase kinase (ASK), to activate DNA helicase. However, the mechanism underlying regulation of CDC7-ASK complex is unclear. Here, we show that ADP generated from CDC7-mediated MCM phosphorylation binds to an allosteric region of CDC7, disrupts CDC7-ASK interaction, and inhibits CDC7-ASK activity in a feedback way. EGFR- and ERK-activated casein kinase 2α (CK2α) phosphorylates nuclear phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) 1 at S256, resulting in interaction of PGK1 with CDC7. CDC7-bound PGK1 converts ADP to ATP, thereby abrogating the inhibitory effect of ADP on CDC7-ASK activity, promoting the recruitment of DNA helicase to replication origins, DNA replication, cell proliferation, and brain tumorigenesis. These findings reveal an instrumental self-regulatory mechanism of CDC7-ASK activity by its kinase reaction product ADP and a nonglycolytic role for PGK1 in abrogating this negative feedback in promoting tumor development.

Abstract: Summary
During development, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) arise from specialized endothelial cells by a process termed endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). The genetic program driving human HSPC emergence remains largely unknown. We previously reported that the generation of hemogenic precursor cells from mouse fibroblasts recapitulates developmental hematopoiesis. Here, we demonstrate that human fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into hemogenic cells by the same transcription factors. Induced cells display dynamic EHT transcriptional programs, generate hematopoietic progeny, possess HSPC cell surface phenotype, and repopulate immunodeficient mice for 3 months. Mechanistically, GATA2 and GFI1B interact and co-occupy a cohort of targets. This cooperative binding is reflected by engagement of open enhancers and promoters, initiating silencing of fibroblast genes and activating the hemogenic program. However, GATA2 displays dominant and independent targeting activity during the early phases of reprogramming. These findings shed light on the processes controlling human HSC specification and support generation of reprogrammed HSCs for clinical applications.

Abstract: Summary
We previously established the contribution of de novo damaging sequence variants to Tourette disorder (TD) through whole-exome sequencing of 511 trios. Here, we sequence an additional 291 TD trios and analyze the combined set of 802 trios. We observe an overrepresentation of de novo damaging variants in simplex, but not multiplex, families; we identify a high-confidence TD risk gene, CELSR3 (cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 3); we find that the genes mutated in TD patients are enriched for those related to cell polarity, suggesting a common pathway underlying pathobiology; and we confirm a statistically significant excess of de novo copy number variants in TD. Finally, we identify significant overlap of de novo sequence variants between TD and obsessive-compulsive disorder and de novo copy number variants between TD and autism spectrum disorder, consistent with shared genetic risk.

Abstract: The stepwise development of T cells from a multipotent precursor is guided by diverse mechanisms, including interactions among lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, which play crucial roles in mammalian development and lineage commitment. To elucidate the transcriptional networks and epigenetic mechanisms underlying T-cell lineage commitment, we investigated genome-wide changes in gene expression, DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation among populations representing five successive stages of T-cell development (DN3, DN4, DP, CD4+, and CD8+) by performing RNA-seq, MBD-seq and hMeDIP-seq, respectively. The most significant changes in the transcriptomes and epigenomes occurred during the DN4 to DP transition. During the DP stage, many genes involved in chromatin modification were up-regulated and exhibited dramatic changes in DNA hydroxymethylation. We also observed 436 alternative splicing events, and approximately 57% (252) of these events occurred during the DP stage. Many stage-specific, differentially methylated regions were observed near the stage-specific, differentially expressed genes. The dynamic changes in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation were associated with the recruitment of stage-specific TFs. We elucidated interactive networks comprising TFs, chromatin modifiers, and DNA methylation and hope that this study provides a framework for the understanding of the molecular networks underlying T-cell lineage commitment.

Abstract: Summary
Emphysema results in destruction of alveolar walls and enlargement of lung airspaces and has been shown to develop during helminth infections through IL-4R-independent mechanisms. We examined whether interleukin 17A (IL-17A) may instead modulate development of emphysematous pathology in mice infected with the helminth parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. We found that transient elevations in IL-17A shortly after helminth infection triggered subsequent emphysema that destroyed alveolar structures. Furthermore, lung B cells, activated through IL-4R signaling, inhibited early onset of emphysematous pathology. IL-10 and other regulatory cytokines typically associated with B regulatory cell function did not play a major role in this response. Instead, at early stages of the response, B cells produced high levels of the tissue-protective protein, Resistin-like molecule α (RELMα), which then downregulated IL-17A expression. These studies show that transient elevations in IL-17A trigger emphysema and reveal a helminth-induced immune regulatory mechanism that controls IL-17A and the severity of emphysema.

Abstract: Summary
Gene regulation of multipotent neuroretinal progenitors is partially understood. Through characterizing Six3 and Six6 double knockout retinas (DKOs), we demonstrate Six3 and Six6 are jointly required for the maintenance of multipotent neuroretinal progenitors. Phenotypes in DKOs were not found in either Six3 nulls or Six6 nulls. At the far periphery, ciliary margin (CM) markers Otx1 and Cdon together with Wnt3a and Fzd1 were ectopically upregulated, whereas neuroretinal progenitor markers Sox2, Notch1, and Otx2 were absent or reduced. At the mid periphery, multi-lineage differentiation was defective. The gene set jointly regulated by Six3 and Six6 significantly overlapped with the gene networks regulated by WNT3A, CTNNB1, POU4F2, or SOX2. Stimulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by either Wnt-3a or a GS3Kβ inhibitor promoted CM progenitors at the cost of neuroretinal identity at the periphery of eyecups. Therefore, Six3 and Six6 together directly or indirectly suppress Wnt/β-catenin signaling but promote retinogenic factors for the maintenance of multipotent neuroretinal progenitors.

Abstract: Intracellular accumulation of oligomeric forms of β amyloid (Aβ) are now believed to play a key role in the earliest phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as their rise correlates well with the early symptoms of the disease. Extensive evidence points to impaired neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis as a direct consequence of the intracellular Aβ oligomers. However, little is known about the downstream effects of the resulting Ca2+ rise on the many intracellular Ca2+-dependent pathways. Here we use multiscale modeling in conjunction with patch-clamp electrophysiology of single inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) and fluorescence imaging of whole-cell Ca2+ response, induced by exogenously applied intracellular Aβ42 oligomers to show that Aβ42 inflicts cytotoxicity by impairing mitochondrial function. Driven by patch-clamp experiments, we first model the kinetics of IP3R, which is then extended to build a model for the whole-cell Ca2+ signals. The whole-cell model is then fitted to fluorescence signals to quantify the overall Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum by intracellular Aβ42 oligomers through G-protein-mediated stimulation of IP3 production. The estimated IP3 concentration as a function of intracellular Aβ42 content together with the whole-cell model allows us to show that Aβ42 oligomers impair mitochondrial function through pathological Ca2+ uptake and the resulting reduced mitochondrial inner membrane potential, leading to an overall lower ATP and increased production of reactive oxygen species and H2O2. We further show that mitochondrial function can be restored by the addition of Ca2+ buffer EGTA, in accordance with the observed abrogation of Aβ42 cytotoxicity by EGTA in our live cells experiments.

Abstract: From Xenopus embryo studies, the BMP4/Smad1-targeted gene circuit is a key signaling pathway for specifying the cell fate between the ectoderm and neuro-ectoderm as well as the ventral and dorsal mesoderm. In this context, several BMP4/Smad1 target transcriptional factors have been identified as repressors of the neuro-ectoderm. However, none of these direct target transcription factors in this pathway, including GATA1b, Msx1 and Ventx1.1 have yet been proven as direct repressors of early neuro-ectodermal gene expression. In order to demonstrate that Ventx1.1 is a direct repressor of neuro-ectoderm genes, a genome-wide Xenopus ChIP-Seq of Ventx1.1 was performed. In this study, we demonstrated that Ventx1.1 bound to the Ventx1.1 response cis-acting element 1 and 2 (VRE1 and VRE2) on the promoter for zic3, which is a key early neuro-ectoderm gene, and this Ventx1.1 binding led to repression of zic3 transcription. Site-directed mutagenesis of VRE1 and VRE2 within zic3 promoter completely abolished the repression caused by Ventx1.1. In addition, we found both the positive and negative regulation of zic3 promoter activity by FoxD5b and Xcad2, respectively, and that these occur through the VREs and via modulation of Ventx1.1 levels. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the BMP4/Smad1 target gene, Ventx1.1, is a direct repressor of neuro-ectodermal gene zic3 during early Xenopus embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
In animal germlines, regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation is particularly important but poorly understood. Here, using a cryo-cut approach, we mapped RNA expression along the Caenorhabditis elegans germline and, using mutants, dissected gene regulatory mechanisms that control spatiotemporal expression. We detected, at near single-cell resolution, >10,000 mRNAs, >300 miRNAs, and numerous unannotated miRNAs. Most RNAs were organized in distinct spatial patterns. Germline-specific miRNAs and their targets were co-localized. Moreover, we observed differential 3′ UTR isoform usage for hundreds of mRNAs. In tumorous gld-2 gld-1 mutants, gene expression was strongly perturbed. In particular, differential 3′ UTR usage was significantly impaired. We propose that PIE-1, a transcriptional repressor, functions to maintain spatial gene expression. Our data also suggest that cpsf-4 and fipp-1 control differential 3′ UTR usage for hundreds of genes. Finally, we constructed a “virtual gonad” enabling “virtual in situ hybridizations” and access to all data (https://shiny.mdc-berlin.de/spacegerm/).

Abstract: Summary
Skin sun exposure induces two protection programs: stress responses and pigmentation, the former within minutes and the latter only hours afterward. Although serving the same physiological purpose, it is not known whether and how these programs are coordinated. Here, we report that UVB exposure every other day induces significantly more skin pigmentation than the higher frequency of daily exposure, without an associated increase in stress responses. Using mathematical modeling and empirical studies, we show that the melanocyte master regulator, MITF, serves to synchronize stress responses and pigmentation and, furthermore, functions as a UV-protection timer via damped oscillatory dynamics, thereby conferring a trade-off between the two programs. MITF oscillations are controlled by multiple negative regulatory loops, one at the transcriptional level involving HIF1α and another post-transcriptional loop involving microRNA-148a. These findings support trait linkage between the two skin protection programs, which, we speculate, arose during furless skin evolution to minimize skin damage.

Abstract: Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, impairing cognitive and motor functions. One of the pathological hallmarks of AD is neuronal loss, which is not reflected in mouse models of AD. Therefore, the role of neuronal death is still uncertain. Here, we used a Drosophila AD model expressing a secreted form of human amyloid-β42 peptide and showed that it recapitulates key aspects of AD pathology, including neuronal death and impaired long-term memory. We found that neuronal apoptosis is mediated by cell fitness-driven neuronal culling, which selectively eliminates impaired neurons from brain circuits. We demonstrated that removal of less fit neurons delays β-amyloid-induced brain damage and protects against cognitive and motor decline, suggesting that contrary to common knowledge, neuronal death may have a beneficial effect in AD.

Abstract: Summary
There is a considerable need to identify those individuals with prostate cancer who have indolent disease. We propose that genes that control adult stem cell homeostasis in organs with slow turnover, such as the prostate, control cancer fate. One such gene, KLF4, overexpressed in murine prostate stem cells, regulates their homeostasis, blocks malignant transformation, and controls the self-renewal of tumor-initiating cells. KLF4 loss induces the molecular features of aggressive cancer and converts PIN lesions to invasive sarcomatoid carcinomas; its re-expression in vivo reverses this process. Bioinformatic analysis links these changes to human cancer. KLF4 and its downstream targets make up a gene signature that identifies indolent tumors and predicts recurrence-free survival. This approach may improve prognosis and identify therapeutic targets for advanced cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Training-dependent increases in c-fos have been used to identify engram cells encoding long-term memories (LTMs). However, the interaction between transcription factors required for LTM, including CREB and c-Fos, and activating kinases such as phosphorylated ERK (pERK) in the establishment of memory engrams has been unclear. Formation of LTM of an aversive olfactory association in flies requires repeated training trials with rest intervals between trainings. Here, we find that prolonged rest interval-dependent increases in pERK induce transcriptional cycling between c-Fos and CREB in a subset of KCs in the mushroom bodies, where olfactory associations are made and stored. Preexisting CREB is required for initial c-fos induction, while c-Fos is required later to increase CREB expression. Blocking or activating c-fos-positive engram neurons inhibits memory recall or induces memory-associated behaviors. Our results suggest that c-Fos/CREB cycling defines LTM engram cells required for LTM.

Abstract: Summary
The niche critically controls stem cell behavior, but its regulatory input at the whole-genome level is poorly understood. We elucidated transcriptional programs of the somatic and germline lineages in the Drosophila testis and genome-wide binding profiles of Zfh-1 and Abd-A expressed in somatic support cells and crucial for fate acquisition of both cell lineages. We identified key roles of nucleoporins and V-ATPase proton pumps and demonstrate their importance in controlling germline development from the support side. To make our dataset publicly available, we generated an interactive analysis tool, which uncovered conserved core genes of adult stem cells across species boundaries. We tested the functional relevance of these genes in the Drosophila testis and intestine and found a high frequency of stem cell defects. In summary, our dataset and interactive platform represent versatile tools for identifying gene networks active in diverse stem cell types.
