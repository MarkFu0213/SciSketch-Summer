Abstract: Summary
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are the central apparatus of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Disease-specific alterations of NPCs contribute to the pathogenesis of many cancers; however, the roles of NPCs in glioblastoma (GBM) are unknown. In this study, we report genomic amplification of NUP107, a component of NPCs, in GBM and show that NUP107 is overexpressed simultaneously with MDM2, a critical E3 ligase that mediates p53 degradation. Depletion of NUP107 inhibits the growth of GBM cell lines through p53 protein stabilization. Mechanistically, NPCs establish a p53 degradation platform via an export pathway coupled with 26S proteasome tethering. NUP107 is the keystone for NPC assembly; the loss of NUP107 affects the integrity of the NPC structure, and thus the proportion of 26S proteasome in the vicinity of nuclear pores significantly decreases. Together, our findings establish roles of NPCs in transport surveillance and provide insights into p53 inactivation in GBM.

Abstract: Summary
Development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infections relies on mechanistic knowledge of virus-host interface. Abundant physical interactions between viral and host proteins have been identified, but few have been functionally characterized. Harnessing the power of fly genetics, we develop a comprehensive Drosophila COVID-19 resource (DCR) consisting of publicly available strains for conditional tissue-specific expression of all SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins, UAS-human cDNA transgenic lines encoding established host-viral interacting factors, and GAL4 insertion lines disrupting fly homologs of SARS-CoV-2 human interacting proteins. We demonstrate the utility of the DCR to functionally assess SARS-CoV-2 genes and candidate human binding partners. We show that NSP8 engages in strong genetic interactions with several human candidates, most prominently with the ATE1 arginyltransferase to induce actin arginylation and cytoskeletal disorganization, and that two ATE1 inhibitors can reverse NSP8 phenotypes. The DCR enables parallel global-scale functional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 components in a prime genetic model system.

Abstract: Summary
Homeothermy is crucial for mammals. Postnatal growth is the key period for young offspring to acquire gut microbiota. Although gut microbiota may affect mammal thermogenesis, the impact of developmental regulation of gut microbiota on the ability of young pups to produce heat remains unclear. Antibiotics were used to interfere with the establishment of gut microbiota during the development of Brandt’s voles, and their thermogenic development and regulatory pathways were determined. Deprivation of microbiota by antibiotics inhibits the development of thermogenesis in pups. Butyric acid and bile acid, as metabolites of gut microbiota, participated in the thermoregulation of pups. We propose that gut microbiota promote the development of thermoregulation through the butyric acid-free fatty acid receptor-2-uncoupling protein-1 or the deoxycholic acid-Takeda-G-protein-receptor-5-uncoupling protein-1 pathway in pups. These results show a relationship between gut microbiota and thermogenesis and expand the mechanism of postnatal development of thermogenesis in small mammals.

Abstract: Summary
A hypoxic microenvironment contributes to tumor progression, with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) being a critical regulator. We have reported that 14-3-3σ is negatively associated with HIF-1α expression; however, its role in hypoxia-induced tumor progression remains poorly characterized. Here we show that 14-3-3σ suppresses cancer hypoxia-induced metastasis and angiogenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). 14-3-3σ opposes HIF-1α expression by regulating the protein stability of HIF-1α, thereby decreasing HIF-1α transcriptional activity and suppressing tumor progression. Mechanistic studies show that the 14-3-3σ-interacting protein neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 4-like (NEDD4L) is an E3 ligase that targets HIF-1α. 14-3-3σ promotes the binding of S448-phosphorylated NEDD4L to HIF-1α, thereby enhancing HIF-1α poly-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistent with this anti-tumorigenic function for 14-3-3σ, low 14-3-3σ expression levels correlate with poor CRC patient survival, and 14-3-3σ enhances the response of CRC to bevacizumab. These results reveal an important mechanism for 14-3-3σ in tumor suppression through HIF-1α regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of transcription is a hallmark of cancer, including bladder cancer (BLCA). CRISPR-Cas9 screening using a lentivirus library with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting human transcription factors and chromatin modifiers is used to reveal genes critical for the proliferation and survival of BLCA cells. As a result, the nuclear transcription factor Y subunit gamma (NFYC)-37, but not NFYC-50, is observed to promote cell proliferation and tumor growth in BLCA. Mechanistically, NFYC-37 interacts with CBP and SREBP2 to activate mevalonate pathway transcription, promoting cholesterol biosynthesis. However, NFYC-50 recruits more of the arginine methyltransferase CARM1 than NFYC-37 to methylate CBP, which prevents the CBP-SREBP2 interaction and subsequently inhibits the mevalonate pathway. Importantly, statins targeting the mevalonate pathway can suppress NFYC-37-induced cell proliferation and tumor growth, indicating the need for conducting a clinical trial with statins for treating patients with BLCA and high NFYC-37 levels, as most patients with BLCA have high NFYC-37 levels.

Abstract: Summary
Glucose metabolism is known to orchestrate oncogenesis. Whether glucose serves as a signaling molecule directly regulating oncoprotein activity for tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here, we report that glucose is a cofactor binding to methyltransferase NSUN2 at amino acid 1–28 to promote NSUN2 oligomerization and activation. NSUN2 activation maintains global m5C RNA methylation, including TREX2, and stabilizes TREX2 to restrict cytosolic dsDNA accumulation and cGAS/STING activation for promoting tumorigenesis and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy resistance. An NSUN2 mutant defective in glucose binding or disrupting glucose/NSUN2 interaction abolishes NSUN2 activity and TREX2 induction leading to cGAS/STING activation for oncogenic suppression. Strikingly, genetic deletion of the glucose/NSUN2/TREX2 axis suppresses tumorigenesis and overcomes anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy resistance in those cold tumors through cGAS/STING activation to facilitate apoptosis and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Our study identifies NSUN2 as a direct glucose sensor whose activation by glucose drives tumorigenesis and immunotherapy resistance by maintaining TREX2 expression for cGAS/STING inactivation.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the deadliest human cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of ∼7%. Here, we performed a targeted proteomics analysis of human SCLC samples and thereby identified hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) in the salvage purine synthesis pathway as a factor that contributes to SCLC malignancy by promoting cell survival in a glutamine-starved environment. Inhibition of HPRT1 by 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in combination with methotrexate (MTX), which blocks the de novo purine synthesis pathway, attenuated the growth of SCLC in mouse xenograft models. Moreover, modulation of host glutamine anabolism with the glutamine synthetase inhibitor methionine sulfoximine (MSO) in combination with 6-MP and MTX treatment resulted in marked tumor suppression and prolongation of host survival. Our results thus suggest that modulation of host glutamine anabolism combined with simultaneous inhibition of the de novo and salvage purine synthesis pathways may be of therapeutic benefit for SCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous proteins are targeted to two or multiple subcellular destinations where they exert distinct functional consequences. The balance between such differential targeting is thought to be determined post-translationally, relying on protein sorting mechanisms. Here, we show that mRNA location and translation rate can also determine protein targeting by modulating protein binding to specific interacting partners. Peripheral localization of the NET1 mRNA and fast translation lead to higher cytosolic retention of the NET1 protein by promoting its binding to the membrane-associated scaffold protein CASK. By contrast, perinuclear mRNA location and/or slower translation rate favor nuclear targeting by promoting binding to importins. This mRNA location-dependent mechanism is modulated by physiological stimuli and profoundly impacts NET1 function in cell motility. These results reveal that the location of protein synthesis and the rate of translation elongation act in coordination as a “partner-selection” mechanism that robustly influences protein distribution and function.

Abstract: Summary
Resting metabolic rate (RMR) adaptation occurs during obesity and is hypothesized to contribute to failed weight management. Angiotensin II (Ang-II) type 1 (AT1A) receptors in Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons contribute to the integrative control of RMR, and deletion of AT1A from AgRP neurons causes RMR adaptation. Extracellular patch-clamp recordings identify distinct cellular responses of individual AgRP neurons from lean mice to Ang-II: no response, inhibition via AT1A and Gαi, or stimulation via Ang-II type 2 (AT2) receptors and Gαq. Following diet-induced obesity, a subset of Ang-II/AT1A-inhibited AgRP neurons undergo a spontaneous G-protein “signal switch,” whereby AT1A stop inhibiting the cell via Gαi and instead begin stimulating the cell via Gαq. DREADD-mediated activation of Gαi, but not Gαq, in AT1A-expressing AgRP cells stimulates RMR in lean and obese mice. Thus, loss of AT1A-Gαi coupling within the AT1A-expressing AgRP neuron subtype represents a molecular mechanism contributing to RMR adaptation.

Abstract: Summary
T-bet and FOXO1 are transcription factors canonically associated with effector and memory T cell fates, respectively. During an infectious response, these factors direct the development of CD8+ T cell fates, where T-bet deficiency leads to ablation of only short-lived effector cells, while FOXO1 deficiency results in selective loss of memory. In contrast, following adjuvanted subunit vaccination in mice, both effector- and memory-fated T cells are compromised in the absence of either T-bet or FOXO1. Thus, unlike responses to challenge with Listeria monocytogenes, productive CD8+ T cell responses to adjuvanted vaccination require coordinated regulation of FOXO1 and T-bet transcriptional programs. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis confirms simultaneous T-bet, FOXO1, and TCF1 transcriptional activity in vaccine-elicited, but not infection-elicited, T cells undergoing clonal expansion. Collectively, our data show that subunit vaccine adjuvants elicit T cell responses dependent on transcription factors associated with effector and memory cell fates.

Abstract: Aging is a highly complicated natural process. Brain aging is associated with remarkable neurodegenerative changes and oxidative damage. Whey protein (WP) has been mentioned to have an antioxidant property. Nuclear factor erythrogen-2 associated factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway is an antioxidant defense system. Nrf2 activity declines with age so, its activation could be a promising therapeutic strategy for aging. This study aimed to explore the anti-aging role of WP against D-galactose (D-gal) induced age-related degenerative changes and oxidative damage in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and investigate its underlying mechanisms. Forty adult male rats were divided into 4 groups; control, WP group received WP (28.77 mg/kg/day) by gastric tube on the 4th experimental week; D-gal (model group) received D-gal (300 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally for 8 weeks and D-gal +WP group received WP on the 4th week of D-gal treatment. Specimens from PFC were obtained for biochemical, histological, immunohistochemical and western blot analysis. WP treatment in D-gal +WP group reduced lipid peroxidation, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities, decreased advanced glycation end products level and improved the histological and ultrastructural alterations. Moreover, the number of neurons expressed the senescence marker; p21 and percentage area of the astrocytic marker; glial fibrillary acidic protein were significantly reduced. WP also enhanced Nrf2 pathway and its downstream targets; heme oxygenase-1 and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1. In conclusion WP alleviates the D-gal-induced PFC aging through activating Nrf2 pathway, reducing cell senescence and gliosis. So, it may be a potential therapeutic target to retard the aging process.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular code that controls synapse formation and maintenance in vivo has remained quite sparse. Here, we identify that the secreted protein Adamtsl3 functions as critical hippocampal synapse organizer acting through the transmembrane receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer). Traditionally, DCC function has been associated with glutamatergic synaptogenesis and plasticity in response to Netrin-1 signaling. We demonstrate that early post-natal deletion of Adamtsl3 in neurons impairs DCC protein expression, causing reduced density of both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Adult deletion of Adamtsl3 in either GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons does not interfere with DCC-Netrin-1 function at glutamatergic synapses but controls DCC signaling at GABAergic synapses. The Adamtsl3-DCC signaling unit is further essential for activity-dependent adaptations at GABAergic synapses, involving DCC phosphorylation and Src kinase activation. These findings might be particularly relevant for schizophrenia because genetic variants in Adamtsl3 and DCC have been independently linked with schizophrenia in patients.

Abstract: Summary
Infections cause catabolism of fat and muscle stores. Traditionally, studies have focused on understanding how the innate immune system contributes to energy stores wasting, while the role of the adaptive immune system remains elusive. In the present study, we examine the role of the adaptive immune response in adipose tissue wasting and cachexia using a murine model of the chronic parasitic infection Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness. We find that the wasting response occurs in two phases, with the first stage involving fat wasting caused by CD4+ T cell-induced anorexia and a second anorexia-independent cachectic stage that is dependent on CD8+ T cells. Fat wasting has no impact on host antibody-mediated resistance defenses or survival, while later-stage muscle wasting contributes to disease-tolerance defenses. Our work reveals a decoupling of adaptive immune-mediated resistance from the catabolic response during infection.

Abstract: Summary
Prion-like protein propagation is considered a common pathogenic mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. Here we investigate the in vivo propagation pattern and aggregation state of mutant α-synuclein by injecting adeno-associated viral (AAV)-α-synuclein-A53T-EGFP into the mouse olfactory cortex. Comparison of aggregation states in various brain regions at multiple time points after injection using western blot analyses shows that the monomeric state of the mutant/misfolded protein propagates to remote brain regions by 2 weeks and that the propagated proteins aggregate in situ after being incorporated into neurons. Moreover, injection of Alexa 488-labeled α-synuclein-A53T confirms the monomeric propagation at 2 weeks. Super-resolution microscopy shows that both α-synuclein-A53T proteins propagate via the lymphatic system, penetrate perineuronal nets, and reach the surface of neurons. Electron microscopy shows that the propagated mutant/misfolded monomer forms fibrils characteristic of Parkinson’s disease after its incorporation into neurons. These findings suggest a mode of propagation different from that of aggregate-dependent propagation.

Abstract: Summary
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an encephalitic alphavirus responsible for epidemics of neurological disease across the Americas. Low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain-containing 3 (LDLRAD3) is a recently reported entry receptor for VEEV. Here, using wild-type and Ldlrad3-deficient mice, we define a critical role for LDLRAD3 in controlling steps in VEEV infection, pathogenesis, and neurotropism. Our analysis shows that LDLRAD3 is required for efficient VEEV infection and pathogenesis prior to and after central nervous system invasion. Ldlrad3-deficient mice survive intranasal and intracranial VEEV inoculation and show reduced infection of neurons in different brain regions. As LDLRAD3 is a determinant of pathogenesis and an entry receptor required for VEEV infection of neurons of the brain, receptor-targeted therapies may hold promise as countermeasures.

Abstract: Summary
Hippocampal CA1 neurons generate single spikes and stereotyped bursts of spikes. However, it is unclear how individual neurons dynamically switch between these output modes and whether these two spiking outputs relay distinct information. We performed extracellular recordings in spatially navigating rats and cellular voltage imaging and optogenetics in awake mice. We found that spike bursts are preferentially linked to cellular and network theta rhythms (3–12 Hz) and encode an animal’s position via theta phase precession, particularly as animals are entering a place field. In contrast, single spikes exhibit additional coupling to gamma rhythms (30–100 Hz), particularly as animals leave a place field. Biophysical modeling suggests that intracellular properties alone are sufficient to explain the observed input frequency-dependent spike coding. Thus, hippocampal neurons regulate the generation of bursts and single spikes according to frequency-specific network and intracellular dynamics, suggesting that these spiking modes perform distinct computations to support spatial behavior.

The nucleus is increasingly viewed as a mechanosensory organelle that determines migratory strategies. However, how the nucleus crosstalks with invadopodia is little known. Here, we report that the oncogenic septin 9 isoform 1 (SEPT9_i1) is a component of breast cancer invadopodia. SEPT9_i1 depletion diminishes invadopodium formation and the clustering of the invadopodium precursor components TKS5 and cortactin. This phenotype is characterized by deformed nuclei and nuclear envelopes with folds and grooves. We show that SEPT9_i1 localizes to the nuclear envelope and juxtanuclear invadopodia. Moreover, exogenous lamin A rescues nuclear morphology and juxtanuclear TKS5 clusters. Importantly, SEPT9_i1 is required for the amplification of juxtanuclear invadopodia, which is induced by the epidermal growth factor. We posit that nuclei of low deformability favor the formation of juxtanuclear invadopodia in a SEPT9_i1-dependent manner, which functions as a tunable mechanism for overcoming ECM impenetrability.

Abstract: Summary
Canonical interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling via the high-affinity CD25-containing IL-2 receptor-Janus kinase (JAK)1,3-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) pathway is essential for development and maintenance of CD4+CD25HiFoxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) that support immune homeostasis. Here, we report that IL-2 signaling via an alternative CD25-chemokine receptor pathway promotes the suppressive function of Tregs. Using an antibody against CD25 that biases IL-2 signaling toward this alternative pathway, we establish that this pathway increases the suppressive activity of Tregs and ameliorates murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Furthermore, heparan sulfate, an IL-2-binding element of cell surfaces and extracellular matrix, or an engineered IL-2 immunocytokine can also direct IL-2 signaling toward this alternative pathway. Overall, these data reveal a non-canonical mechanism for IL-2 signaling that promotes suppressive functions of Tregs, further elucidates how IL-2 supports immune homeostasis, and suggests approaches to promote or suppress Treg functions.

Abstract: Summary
While the pivotal role of linker histone H1 in shaping nucleosome organization is well established, its functional interplays with chromatin factors along the epigenome are just starting to emerge. Here we show that, in Arabidopsis, as in mammals, H1 occupies Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) target genes where it favors chromatin condensation and H3K27me3 deposition. We further show that, contrasting with its conserved function in PRC2 activation at genes, H1 selectively prevents H3K27me3 accumulation at telomeres and large pericentromeric interstitial telomeric repeat (ITR) domains by restricting DNA accessibility to Telomere Repeat Binding (TRB) proteins, a group of H1-related Myb factors mediating PRC2 cis recruitment. This study provides a mechanistic framework by which H1 avoids the formation of gigantic H3K27me3-rich domains at telomeric sequences and contributes to safeguard nucleus architecture.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin accessibility is integral to the process by which transcription factors (TFs) read out cis-regulatory DNA sequences, but it is difficult to differentiate between TFs that drive accessibility and those that do not. Deep learning models that learn complex sequence rules provide an unprecedented opportunity to dissect this problem. Using zygotic genome activation in Drosophila as a model, we analyzed high-resolution TF binding and chromatin accessibility data with interpretable deep learning and performed genetic validation experiments. We identify a hierarchical relationship between the pioneer TF Zelda and the TFs involved in axis patterning. Zelda consistently pioneers chromatin accessibility proportional to motif affinity, whereas patterning TFs augment chromatin accessibility in sequence contexts where they mediate enhancer activation. We conclude that chromatin accessibility occurs in two tiers: one through pioneering, which makes enhancers accessible but not necessarily active, and the second when the correct combination of TFs leads to enhancer activation.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic remodeling is one of the earliest events that occur during cell differentiation. Here, we define fatty acid metabolism as a key player in definitive endoderm differentiation from human embryonic stem cells. Fatty acid β-oxidation is enhanced while lipogenesis is decreased, and this is due to the phosphorylation of lipogenic enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase by AMPK. More importantly, inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by either its inhibitors or AMPK agonist significantly promotes human endoderm differentiation, while blockade of fatty acid oxidation impairs differentiation. Mechanistically, reduced de novo fatty acid synthesis and enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation both contribute to the accumulation of intracellular acetyl-CoA, which guarantees the acetylation of SMAD3 and further causes nuclear localization to promote endoderm differentiation. Thus, our current study identifies a fatty acid synthesis/oxidation shift during early differentiation and presents an instructive role for fatty acid metabolism in regulating human endoderm differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
During nervous system development, neurons choose synaptic partners with remarkable specificity; however, the cell-cell recognition mechanisms governing rejection of inappropriate partners remain enigmatic. Here, we show that mouse retinal neurons avoid inappropriate partners by using the FLRT2-uncoordinated-5 (UNC5) receptor-ligand system. Within the inner plexiform layer (IPL), FLRT2 is expressed by direction-selective (DS) circuit neurons, whereas UNC5C/D are expressed by non-DS neurons projecting to adjacent IPL sublayers. In vivo gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that FLRT2-UNC5 binding eliminates growing DS dendrites that have strayed from the DS circuit IPL sublayers. Abrogation of FLRT2-UNC5 binding allows mistargeted arbors to persist, elaborate, and acquire synapses from inappropriate partners. Conversely, UNC5C misexpression within DS circuit sublayers inhibits dendrite growth and drives arbors into adjacent sublayers. Mechanistically, UNC5s promote dendrite elimination by interfering with FLRT2-mediated adhesion. Based on their broad expression, FLRT-UNC5 recognition is poised to exert widespread effects upon synaptic partner choices across the nervous system.

Abstract: Summary
The differentiation fate of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) affects the progression of steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH). We find that lncRNA DGCR5 encodes a 102-amino acid polypeptide, RIP (Rac1 inactivated peptide), which promotes the adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs and aggravates the progression of SONFH. RIP, instead of lncRNA DGCR5, binds to the N-terminal motif of RAC1, and inactivates the RAC1/PAK1 cascade, resulting in decreased Ser675 phosphorylation of β-catenin. Ultimately, the nuclear localization of β-catenin decreases, and the differentiation balance of BMSCs tilts toward the adipogenesis lineage. In the femoral head of rats, overexpression of RIP causes trabecular bone disorder and adipocyte accumulation, which can be rescued by overexpressing RAC1. This finding expands the regulatory role of lncRNAs in BMSCs and suggests RIP as a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
NUP98 and NUP214 form chimeric fusion proteins that assemble into phase-separated nuclear bodies containing CRM1, a nuclear export receptor. However, these nuclear bodies’ function in controlling gene expression remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the nuclear bodies of NUP98::HOXA9 and SET::NUP214 promote the condensation of mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), a histone methyltransferase essential for the maintenance of HOX gene expression. These nuclear bodies are robustly associated with MLL1/CRM1 and co-localized on chromatin. Furthermore, whole-genome chromatin-conformation capture analysis reveals that NUP98::HOXA9 induces a drastic alteration in high-order genome structure at target regions concomitant with the generation of chromatin loops and/or rearrangement of topologically associating domains in a phase-separation-dependent manner. Collectively, these results show that the phase-separated nuclear bodies of nucleoporin fusion proteins can enhance the activation of target genes by promoting the condensation of MLL1/CRM1 and rearrangement of the 3D genome structure.

Abstract: Doxorubicin (DXR) is widely used in cancer treatment. However, it has not yet been possible to prevent the side effects of DXR. The aim of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of crocin against DXR used in cancer treatment. For this reason; forty Wistar rats (male-250–300 g) were allocated into four groups (n = 10/group): Control, Crocin, DXR and DXR+Crocin. Control and Crocin groups were administered saline and crocin (40 mg/kg, i.p) for 15 days, respectively. DXR group, cumulative dose 12 mg/kg DXR, was administered for 12 days via 48 h intervals in six injections (2 mg/kg each, i.p). DXR+Crocin group, crocin (40 mg/kg-i.p) was administered for 15 days, and DXR was given as in the DXR group. The results revealed that serum liver markers (alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased significantly after DXR administration but recovered after crocin therapy. In addition, lipid peroxidation (MDA), and inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) increased after DXR application and the antioxidative defense system (GSH, SOD, CAT) significantly decreased and re-achieved by crocin treatment. Our results conclude that crocin treatment was related to ameliorated hepatocellular architecture and reduced hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation in rats with DXR-induced hepatotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS) are frequently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including increased risk for restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs). Consistent with observations in humans, FXS model mice display distinct RRBs and hyperactivity that are consistent with dysfunctional cortico-striatal circuits, an area relatively unexplored in FXS. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we dissect the contribution of two populations of striatal medium spiny neurons (SPNs) in the expression of RRBs in FXS model mice. Here, we report that dysregulated protein synthesis at cortico-striatal synapses is a molecular culprit of the synaptic and ASD-associated motor phenotypes displayed by FXS model mice. Cell-type-specific translational profiling of the FXS mouse striatum reveals differentially translated mRNAs, providing critical information concerning potential therapeutic targets. Our findings uncover a cell-type-specific impact of the loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) on translation and the sequence of neuronal events in the striatum that drive RRBs in FXS.

Abstract: Infection by Toxoplasma gondii may compromise the intestinal histoarchitecture through the tissue reaction triggered by the parasite. Thus, this study evaluated whether treatment with rosuvastatin modifies duodenal changes caused by the chronic infection induced by cysts of T. gondii. For this, female Swiss mice were distributed into infected and treated group (ITG), infected group (IG), group treated with 40 mg/kg rosuvastatin (TG) and control group (CG). After 72 days of infection, the animals were euthanized, the duodenum was collected and processed for histopathological analysis. We observed an increase in immune cell infiltration in the IG, TG and ITG groups, with injury to the Brunner glands. The infection led to a reduction in collagen fibers and mast cells. Infected and treated animals showed an increase in collagen fibers, acidic mucin-producing goblet cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes and mast cells, in addition to the reduction of muscle, neutral mucin-producing and Paneth cells. While treatment with rosuvastatin alone led to increased muscle layer, proportion of neutral mucin-producing goblet cells, Paneth cells, and reduction of collagen fibers. These findings indicate that the infection and treatment caused changes in the homeostasis of the intestinal wall and treatment with rosuvastatin potentiated most parameters indicative of inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
The neurobiological mechanisms of arousal and anesthesia remain poorly understood. Recent evidence highlights the key role of interactions between the cerebral cortex and the diffusely projecting matrix thalamic nuclei. Here, we interrogate these processes in a whole-brain corticothalamic neural mass model endowed with targeted and diffusely projecting thalamocortical nuclei inferred from empirical data. This model captures key features seen in propofol anesthesia, including diminished network integration, lowered state diversity, impaired susceptibility to perturbation, and decreased corticocortical coherence. Collectively, these signatures reflect a suppression of information transfer across the cerebral cortex. We recover these signatures of conscious arousal by selectively stimulating the matrix thalamus, recapitulating empirical results in macaque, as well as wake-like information processing states that reflect the thalamic modulation of large-scale cortical attractor dynamics. Our results highlight the role of matrix thalamocortical projections in shaping many features of complex cortical dynamics to facilitate the unique communication states supporting conscious awareness.

Abstract: Summary
Lineage plasticity is a form of therapy-induced drug resistance. In prostate cancer, androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors potentially lead to the accretion of tumor relapse with loss of AR signaling and a shift from a luminal state to an alternate program. However, the molecular and signaling mechanisms orchestrating the development of lineage plasticity under the pressure of AR-targeted therapies are not fully understood. Here, a survey of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) identifies ROR2 as the top upregulated RTK following AR pathway inhibition, which feeds into lineage plasticity by promoting stem-cell-like and neuronal networks. Mechanistically, ROR2 activates the ERK/CREB signaling pathway to modulate the expression of the lineage commitment transcription factor ASCL1. Collectively, our findings nominate ROR2 as a potential therapeutic target to reverse the ENZ-induced plastic phenotype and potentially re-sensitize tumors to AR pathway inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Pancreatic islets are endocrine organs that depend on their microvasculature to function. Along with endothelial cells, pericytes comprise the islet microvascular network. These mural cells are crucial for microvascular stability and function, but it is not known if/how they are affected during the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Here, we investigate islet pericyte density, phenotype, and function using living pancreas slices from donors without diabetes, donors with a single T1D-associated autoantibody (GADA+), and recent onset T1D cases. Our data show that islet pericyte and capillary responses to vasoactive stimuli are impaired early on in T1D. Microvascular dysfunction is associated with a switch in the phenotype of islet pericytes toward myofibroblasts. Using publicly available RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, we further found that transcriptional alterations related to endothelin-1 signaling and vascular and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling are hallmarks of single autoantibody (Aab)+ donor pancreata. Our data show that microvascular dysfunction is present at early stages of islet autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
The neddylation inhibitor MLN4924/Pevonedistat is in clinical trials for multiple cancers. Efficacy is generally attributed to cullin RING ligase (CRL) inhibition, but the contribution of non-CRL targets is unknown. Here, CRISPR screens map MLN4924-monotherapy sensitivity in retinoblastoma to a classic DNA damage-induced p53/E2F3/BAX-dependent death effector network, which synergizes with Nutlin3a or Navitoclax. In monotherapy-resistant cells, MLN4924 plus standard-of-care topotecan overcomes resistance, but reduces DNA damage, instead harnessing ribosomal protein nucleolar-expulsion to engage an RPL11/p21/MYCN/E2F3/p53/BAX synergy network that exhibits extensive cross-regulation. Strikingly, unneddylatable RPL11 substitutes for MLN4924 to perturb nucleolar function and enhance topotecan efficacy. Orthotopic tumors exhibit complete responses while preserving visual function. Moreover, MLN4924 plus melphalan deploy this DNA damage-independent strategy to synergistically kill multiple myeloma cells. Thus, MLN4924 synergizes with standard-of-care drugs to unlock a nucleolar death effector network across cancer types implying broad therapeutic relevance.

Abstract: Summary
The KRASG12D mutation is present in nearly half of pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PDAC). We investigated the effects of inhibiting the KRASG12D mutant protein with MRTX1133, a non-covalent small molecule inhibitor of KRASG12D, on early and advanced PDAC and its influence on the tumor microenvironment. Employing 16 different models of KRASG12D-driven PDAC, we demonstrate that MRTX1133 reverses early PDAC growth, increases intratumoral CD8+ effector T cells, decreases myeloid infiltration, and reprograms cancer-associated fibroblasts. MRTX1133 leads to regression of both established PanINs and advanced PDAC. Regression of advanced PDAC requires CD8+ T cells and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) synergizes with MRTX1133 to eradicate PDAC and prolong overall survival. Mechanistically, inhibition of KRASG12D in advanced PDAC and human patient derived organoids induces FAS expression in cancer cells and facilitates CD8+ T cell-mediated death. Collectively, this study provides a rationale for a synergistic combination of MRTX1133 with ICB in clinical trials.

Abstract: Background
SPINK4 was highly expressed in colorectal cancer and resulted in worse prognosis of colorectal cancer patients. However, the expression and function of SPINK4 in colon cancer have not been revealed.
Methods
Analysis from GEPIA website showed the expression and function of SPINK4 in colon cancer samples. Colon cancer cell lines were applied to detect the biological function of SPINK4. Functionally, the transcriptional factor of SPINK4 has been predicted and verified. Finally, the associations between transcriptional factor and SPINK4 have been confirmed.
Results
SPINK4 expression was obviously increased in colon cancer samples. HCT-116 and DXH-1 cells in si-SPINK4–1 or si-SPINK4–2 group displayed an obvious reduction in its proliferation, cell cycle, invasion and migration compared to those in the si-control group. Moreover, transcriptional factor ELF-1 bound to the promoter of SPINK4 and affected its expression in colon cancer cells. High ELF-1 expression was presented in colon cancer samples and resulted in worse prognosis of colon cancer patients. Additionally, si-SPINK4 antagonized the function of ELF-1 overexpression in modulating colon cancer cell proliferation, cell cycle and mobility.
Conclusions
Our findings afforded a theoretical basis for further research on the treatment of colon cancer based on the control of ELF-1/SPINK4 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Splicing of pre-mRNAs critically contributes to gene regulation and proteome expansion in eukaryotes, but our understanding of the recognition and pairing of splice sites during spliceosome assembly lacks detail. Here, we identify the multidomain RNA-binding protein FUBP1 as a key splicing factor that binds to a hitherto unknown cis-regulatory motif. By collecting NMR, structural, and in vivo interaction data, we demonstrate that FUBP1 stabilizes U2AF2 and SF1, key components at the 3′ splice site, through multivalent binding interfaces located within its disordered regions. Transcriptional profiling and kinetic modeling reveal that FUBP1 is required for efficient splicing of long introns, which is impaired in cancer patients harboring FUBP1 mutations. Notably, FUBP1 interacts with numerous U1 snRNP-associated proteins, suggesting a unique role for FUBP1 in splice site bridging for long introns. We propose a compelling model for 3′ splice site recognition of long introns, which represent 80% of all human introns.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a master regulator of cell growth that stimulates macromolecule synthesis through transcription, RNA processing, and post-translational modification of metabolic enzymes. However, the mechanisms of how mTORC1 orchestrates multiple steps of gene expression programs remain unclear. Here, we identify family with sequence similarity 120A (FAM120A) as a transcription co-activator that couples transcription and splicing of de novo lipid synthesis enzymes downstream of mTORC1-serine/arginine-rich protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) signaling. The mTORC1-activated SRPK2 phosphorylates splicing factor serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), enhancing its binding to FAM120A. FAM120A directly interacts with a lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1 at active promoters, thereby bridging the newly transcribed lipogenic genes from RNA polymerase II to the SRSF1 and U1-70K-containing RNA-splicing machinery. This mTORC1-regulated, multi-protein complex promotes efficient splicing and stability of lipogenic transcripts, resulting in fatty acid synthesis and cancer cell proliferation. These results elucidate FAM120A as a critical transcription co-factor that connects mTORC1-dependent gene regulation programs for anabolic cell growth.

Abstract: Summary
CD8+ T cells mediate acute rejection of allografts, which threatens the long-term survival of transplanted organs. Using MHC class I tetramers, we find that allogeneic CD8+ T cells are present at an elevated naive precursor frequency relative to other epitopes, only modestly increase in number after grafting, and maintain high T cell receptor diversity throughout the immune response. While antigen-specific effector CD8+ T cells poorly express the canonical effector marker KLRG-1, expression of the activated glycoform of CD43 defines potent effectors after transplantation. Activated CD43+ effector T cells maintain high expression of the coreceptor induced T cell costimulator (ICOS) in the presence of CTLA-4 immunoglobulin (Ig), and dual CTLA-4 Ig/anti-ICOS treatment prolongs graft survival. These data demonstrate that graft-specific CD8+ T cells have a distinct response profile relative to anti-pathogen CD8+ T cells and that CD43 and ICOS are critical surface receptors that define potent effector CD8+ T cell populations that form after transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) are ligand-binding transcription factors that are widely targeted therapeutically. Agonist binding triggers NR activation and subsequent degradation by unknown ligand-dependent ubiquitin ligase machinery. NR degradation is critical for therapeutic efficacy in malignancies that are driven by retinoic acid and estrogen receptors. Here, we demonstrate the ubiquitin ligase UBR5 drives degradation of multiple agonist-bound NRs, including the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA), retinoid x receptor alpha (RXRA), glucocorticoid, estrogen, liver-X, progesterone, and vitamin D receptors. We present the high-resolution cryo-EMstructure of full-length human UBR5 and a negative stain model representing its interaction with RARA/RXRA. Agonist ligands induce sequential, mutually exclusive recruitment of nuclear coactivators (NCOAs) and UBR5 to chromatin to regulate transcriptional networks. Other pharmacological ligands such as selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) degrade their receptors through differential recruitment of UBR5 or RNF111. We establish the UBR5 transcriptional regulatory hub as a common mediator and regulator of NR-induced transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Learning novel experiences reorganizes hippocampal neuronal circuits, represented as coordinated reactivation patterns in post-experience offline states for memory consolidation. This study examines how awake synchronous events during a novel run are related to post-run reactivation patterns. The disruption of awake sharp-wave ripples inhibited experience-induced increases in the contributions of neurons to post-experience synchronous events. Hippocampal place cells that participate more in awake synchronous events are more strongly reactivated during post-experience synchronous events. Awake synchronous neuronal patterns, in cooperation with place-selective firing patterns, determine cell ensembles that undergo pronounced increases and decreases in their correlated spikes. Taken together, awake synchronous events are fundamental for identifying hippocampal neuronal ensembles to be incorporated into synchronous reactivation during subsequent offline states, thereby facilitating memory consolidation.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic refinement is a critical component of activity-dependent neuronal circuit maturation, through which individual neurons establish specific connectivity with their target axons. Here, we demonstrate that the developmental shift of Golgi polarity is a key process in dendritic refinement. During neonatal development, the Golgi apparatus in layer 4 spiny stellate (SS) neurons in the mouse barrel cortex lose their original apical positioning and acquire laterally polarized distributions. This lateral Golgi polarity, which is oriented toward the barrel center, peaks on postnatal days 5–7 (P5–P7) and disappears by P15, which aligns with the developmental time course of SS neuron dendritic refinement. Genetic ablation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, key players in dendritic refinement, disturbs the lateral Golgi polarity. Golgi polarity manipulation disrupts the asymmetric dendritic projection pattern and the primary-whisker-specific response of SS neurons. Our results elucidate activity-dependent Golgi dynamics and their critical role in developmental neuronal circuit refinement.

Abstract: Summary
Cell lineages accumulate somatic mutations during organismal development, potentially leading to pathological states. The rate of somatic evolution within a cell population can vary due to multiple factors, including selection, a change in the mutation rate, or differences in the microenvironment. Here, we developed a statistical test called the Poisson Tree (PT) test to detect varying evolutionary rates among cell lineages, leveraging the phylogenetic signal of single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) data. We applied the PT test to 24 healthy and cancer samples, rejecting a constant evolutionary rate in 11 out of 15 cancer and five out of nine healthy scDNA-seq datasets. In six cancer datasets, we identified subclonal mutations in known driver genes that could explain the rate accelerations of particular cancer lineages. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of scDNA-seq for studying somatic evolution and suggest that cell lineages often evolve at different rates within cancer and healthy tissues.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms. Familial PD is linked with genetic mutations in genes whose products are either associated with mitochondrial function or endo-lysosomal pathways. Of note, mitochondria are essential to sustain high energy demanding synaptic activity of neurons and alterations in mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling have been proposed as causal events for neurodegenerative process, although the mechanisms responsible for the selective loss of specific neuronal populations in the different neurodegenerative diseases is still not clear. Here, we specifically discuss the importance of a correct mitochondrial communication with the other organelles occurring at regions where their membranes become in close contact. We discuss the nature and the role of contact sites that mitochondria establish with ER, lysosomes, and peroxisomes, and how PD related proteins participate in the regulation/dysregulation of the tethering complexes. Unravelling molecular details of mitochondria tethering could contribute to identify specific therapeutic targets and develop new strategies to counteract the progression of the disease.

Abstract: Summary
We sought to characterize the unique role of somatostatin (SST) in the prelimbic (PL) cortex in mice. We performed slice electrophysiology in pyramidal and GABAergic neurons to characterize the pharmacological mechanism of SST signaling and fiber photometry of GCaMP6f fluorescent calcium signals from SST neurons to characterize the activity profile of SST neurons during exploration of an elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT). We used local delivery of a broad SST receptor (SSTR) agonist and antagonist to test causal effects of SST signaling. SSTR activation hyperpolarizes layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, an effect that is recapitulated with optogenetic stimulation of SST neurons. SST neurons in PL are activated during EPM and OFT exploration, and SSTR agonist administration directly into the PL enhances open arm exploration in the EPM. This work describes a broad ability for SST peptide signaling to modulate microcircuits within the prefrontal cortex and related exploratory behaviors.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet current trials on therapeutic angiogenesis remain suboptimal. Type 2 immunity is critical for post-ischemic regeneration, but its regulatory role in revascularization is poorly characterized. Here, we show that type 2 cytokines, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), are the key mediators in post-ischemic angiogenesis. IL-4/IL-13-deficient mice exhibit impaired reperfusion and muscle repair in an experimental model of PAD. We find that deletion of IL-4Rα in the endothelial compartment, rather than the myeloid compartment, leads to remarkable impairment in revascularization. Mechanistically, IL-4/IL-13 promote endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation via IL-4Rα/STAT6 signaling. Furthermore, attenuated IL-4/IL-13 expression is associated with the angiogenesis deficit in the setting of diabetic PAD, while IL-4/IL-13 treatment rescues this defective regeneration. Our findings reveal the therapeutic potential of type 2 cytokines in treating patients with muscle ischemia.

Abstract: Summary
The recombinase RAD51 plays a core role in DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). The assembly and disassembly of RAD51 filament need to be orderly regulated by mediators such as BRCA2 and anti-recombinases. To screen for potential regulators of RAD51, we perform RAD51 proximity proteomics and identify factor C1orf112. We further find that C1orf112 complexed with FIGNL1 facilitates RAD51 filament disassembly in the HR step of Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. Specifically, C1orf112 physically interacts with FIGNL1 and enhances its protein stability. Meanwhile, the RAD51 filament disassembly activity of FIGNL1 is directly stimulated by C1orf112. BRCA2 directly interacts with C1orf112-FIGNL1 complex and functions upstream of this complex to protect RAD51 filament from premature disassembly. C1orf112- and FIGNL1-deficient cells are primarily sensitive to DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) agents. Thus, these findings suggest an important function of C1orf112 in RAD51 regulation in the HR step of ICL repair by FA pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is causally linked to adaptive aversive learning, and its dysregulation is a core phenotype in anxiety and stress disorders. Here, we record NAc core dopamine during a task where mice learn to discriminate between cues signaling two types of outcomes: (1) footshock presentation and (2) footshock omission. We show that dopamine release is evoked by footshock omission. This dopamine response is largest when the omission is unexpected and decreases over learning, and artificially increasing this signal disrupts discrimination learning. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of dopamine responses to the footshock itself impairs learning. Finally, theory-driven computational modeling suggests that these effects can be explained by dopamine signaling the perceived saliency of predicted aversive events. Together, we elucidate the role of NAc dopamine in aversive learning and offer potential avenues for understanding the neural mechanisms involved in anxiety and stress disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma progression in its early stages remains poorly understood. Here, we transfer PDGFB and genetic barcodes in mouse brain to initiate gliomagenesis and enable direct tracing of glioblastoma evolution from its earliest possible stage. Unexpectedly, we observe a high incidence of clonal extinction events and progressive divergence in clonal sizes, even after the acquisition of malignant phenotype. Computational modeling suggests these dynamics result from clonal-based cell-cell competition. Through bulk and single-cell transcriptome analyses, coupled with lineage tracing, we reveal that Myc transcriptional targets have the strongest correlation with clonal size imbalances. Moreover, we show that the downregulation of Myc expression is sufficient to drive competitive dynamics in intracranially transplanted gliomas. Our findings provide insights into glioblastoma evolution that are inaccessible using conventional retrospective approaches, highlighting the potential of combining clonal tracing and transcriptomic analyses in this field.

Abstract: Summary
The impact of chromosomal inversions on human brain morphology remains underexplored. We studied 35 common inversions classified from genotypes of 33,018 adults with European ancestry. The inversions at 2p22.3, 16p11.2, and 17q21.31 reach genome-wide significance, followed by 8p23.1 and 6p21.33, in their association with cortical and subcortical morphology. The 17q21.31, 8p23.1, and 16p11.2 regions comprise the LRRC37, OR7E, and NPIP duplicated gene families. We find the 17q21.31 MAPT inversion region, known for harboring neurological risk, to be the most salient locus among common variants for shaping and patterning the cortex. Overall, we observe the inverted orientations decreasing brain size, with the exception that the 2p22.3 inversion is associated with increased subcortical volume and the 8p23.1 inversion is associated with increased motor cortex. These significant inversions are in the genomic hotspots of neuropsychiatric loci. Our findings are generalizable to 3,472 children and demonstrate inversions as essential genetic variation to understand human brain phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Neuropeptides and peptide hormones are ancient, widespread signaling molecules that underpin almost all brain functions. They constitute a broad ligand-receptor network, mainly by binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, the organization of the peptidergic network and roles of many peptides remain elusive, as our insight into peptide-receptor interactions is limited and many peptide GPCRs are still orphan receptors. Here we report a genome-wide peptide-GPCR interaction map in Caenorhabditis elegans. By reverse pharmacology screening of over 55,384 possible interactions, we identify 461 cognate peptide-GPCR couples that uncover a broad signaling network with specific and complex combinatorial interactions encoded across and within single peptidergic genes. These interactions provide insights into peptide functions and evolution. Combining our dataset with phylogenetic analysis supports peptide-receptor co-evolution and conservation of at least 14 bilaterian peptidergic systems in C. elegans. This resource lays a foundation for system-wide analysis of the peptidergic network.

Abstract: Summary
Liver mitochondria undergo architectural remodeling that maintains energy homeostasis in response to feeding and fasting. However, the specific components and molecular mechanisms driving these changes and their impact on energy metabolism remain unclear. Through comparative mouse proteomics, we found that fasting induces strain-specific mitochondrial cristae formation in the liver by upregulating MIC19, a subunit of the MICOS complex. Enforced MIC19 expression in the liver promotes cristae formation, mitochondrial respiration, and fatty acid oxidation while suppressing gluconeogenesis. Mice overexpressing hepatic MIC19 show resistance to diet-induced obesity and improved glucose homeostasis. Interestingly, MIC19 overexpressing mice exhibit elevated energy expenditure and increased pedestrian locomotion. Metabolite profiling revealed that uracil accumulates in the livers of these mice due to increased uridine phosphorylase UPP2 activity. Furthermore, uracil-supplemented diet increases locomotion in wild-type mice. Thus, MIC19-induced mitochondrial cristae formation in the liver increases uracil as a signal to promote locomotion, with protective effects against diet-induced obesity.

Abstract: Summary
The amino acid cysteine and its oxidized dimeric form cystine are commonly believed to be synonymous in metabolic functions. Cyst(e)ine depletion not only induces amino acid response but also triggers ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic cell death. Here, we report that unlike general amino acid starvation, cyst(e)ine deprivation triggers ATF4 induction at the transcriptional level. Unexpectedly, it is the shortage of lysosomal cystine, but not the cytosolic cysteine, that elicits the adaptative ATF4 response. The lysosome-nucleus signaling pathway involves the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) that senses lysosomal cystine via the kynurenine pathway. A blockade of lysosomal cystine efflux attenuates ATF4 induction and sensitizes ferroptosis. To potentiate ferroptosis in cancer, we develop a synthetic mRNA reagent, CysRx, that converts cytosolic cysteine to lysosomal cystine. CysRx maximizes cancer cell ferroptosis and effectively suppresses tumor growth in vivo. Thus, intracellular nutrient reprogramming has the potential to induce selective ferroptosis in cancer without systematic starvation.

Abstract: Summary
Fatty acid synthase (FASN) maintains de novo lipogenesis (DNL) to support rapid growth in most proliferating cancer cells. Lipogenic acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) is primarily produced from carbohydrates but can arise from glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation. Here, we show that reductive carboxylation also occurs in the absence of DNL. In FASN-deficient cells, reductive carboxylation is mainly catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), but IDH1-generated cytosolic citrate is not utilized for supplying DNL. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) shows that FASN deficiency induces a net cytosol-to-mitochondria citrate flux through mitochondrial citrate transport protein (CTP). Previously, a similar pathway has been shown to mitigate detachment-induced oxidative stress in anchorage-independent tumor spheroids. We further report that tumor spheroids show reduced FASN activity and that FASN-deficient cells acquire resistance to oxidative stress in a CTP- and IDH1-dependent manner. Collectively, these data indicate that by inducing a cytosol-to-mitochondria citrate flux, anchorage-independent malignant cells can gain redox capacity by trading off FASN-supported rapid growth.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic mutations that cause adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases are often expressed during embryonic stages, but it is unclear whether they alter neurodevelopment and how this might influence disease onset. Here, we show that the most common cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a repeat expansion in C9ORF72, restricts neural stem cell proliferation and reduces cortical and thalamic size in utero. Surprisingly, a repeat expansion-derived dipeptide repeat protein (DPR) not known to reduce neuronal viability plays a key role in impairing neurodevelopment. Pharmacologically mimicking the effects of the repeat expansion on neurodevelopment increases susceptibility of C9ORF72 mice to motor defects. Thus, the C9ORF72 repeat expansion stunts development of the brain regions prominently affected in C9ORF72 FTD/ALS patients.

Abstract: Summary
Amplified lysosome activity is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) orchestrated by oncogenic KRAS that mediates tumor growth and metastasis, though the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Using comparative proteomics, we found that oncogenic KRAS significantly enriches levels of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) on lysosomes. Surprisingly, DOCK8 is aberrantly expressed in a subset of PDAC, where it promotes cell invasion in vitro and in vivo. DOCK8 associates with lysosomes and regulates lysosomal morphology and motility, with loss of DOCK8 leading to increased lysosome size. DOCK8 promotes actin polymerization at the surface of lysosomes while also increasing the proteolytic activity of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Critically, depletion of DOCK8 significantly reduces cathepsin-dependent extracellular matrix degradation and impairs the invasive capacity of PDAC cells. These findings implicate ectopic expression of DOCK8 as a key driver of KRAS-driven lysosomal regulation and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
The BRCA1-interacting protein Obg-like ATPase 1 (OLA1) functions in centriole duplication. In this study, we show the role of the mitotic kinase Aurora A in the reduction of centrosomal OLA1. Aurora A binds to and polyubiquitinates OLA1, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) phosphorylates the T124 residue of OLA1, increases binding of OLA1 to Aurora A and OLA1 polyubiquitination by Aurora A, and reduces centrosomal OLA1 in G2 phase. The kinase activity of Aurora A suppresses OLA1 polyubiquitination. The decrease in centrosomal OLA1 caused by Aurora A-mediated polyubiquitination promotes the recruitment of pericentriolar material proteins in G2 phase. The E3 ligase activity of Aurora A is critical for centrosome amplification induced by its overexpression. The results suggest a dual function of Aurora A as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a kinase in the regulation of centrosomal OLA1, which is essential for proper centrosome maturation in G2 phase.

Abstract: Summary
Acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as osimertinib used to treat EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas, limits long-term efficacy and is frequently caused by non-genetic mechanisms. Here, we define the chromatin accessibility and gene regulatory signatures of osimertinib sensitive and resistant EGFR-mutant cell and patient-derived models and uncover a role for mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes in TKI resistance. By profiling mSWI/SNF genome-wide localization, we identify both shared and cancer cell line-specific gene targets underlying the resistant state. Importantly, genetic and pharmacologic disruption of the SMARCA4/SMARCA2 mSWI/SNF ATPases re-sensitizes a subset of resistant models to osimertinib via inhibition of mSWI/SNF-mediated regulation of cellular programs governing cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, epithelial cell differentiation, and NRF2 signaling. These data highlight the role of mSWI/SNF complexes in supporting TKI resistance and suggest potential utility of mSWI/SNF inhibitors in TKI-resistant lung cancers.

Abstract: Summary
PTEN loss in fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to alterations in myeloid, T-, and B-lineage potentials and T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) development. To explore the mechanism underlying PTEN-regulated hematopoietic lineage choices, we carry out integrated assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), single-cell RNA-seq, and in vitro culture analyses using in vivo-isolated mouse pre-leukemic HSCs and progenitors. We find that PTEN loss alters chromatin accessibility of key lineage transcription factor (TF) binding sites at the prepro-B stage, corresponding to increased myeloid and T-lineage potentials and reduced B-lineage potential. Importantly, we find that PU.1 is an essential TF downstream of PTEN and that altering PU.1 levels can reprogram the chromatin accessibility landscape and myeloid, T-, and B-lineage potentials in Ptennull prepro-B cells. Our study discovers prepro-B as the key developmental stage underlying PTEN-regulated hematopoietic lineage choices and suggests a critical role of PU.1 in modulating the epigenetic state and lineage plasticity of prepro-B progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and retinoblastoma protein (RB) are both important cell-cycle regulators that function in different scenarios. Here, we report that FERM domain-containing 8 (FRMD8) inhibits CDK4 activation and stabilizes RB, thereby causing cell-cycle arrest and inhibiting colorectal cancer (CRC) cell growth. FRMD8 interacts separately with CDK7 and CDK4, and it disrupts the interaction of CDK7 with CDK4, subsequently inhibiting CDK4 activation. FRMD8 competes with MDM2 to bind RB and attenuates MDM2-mediated RB degradation. Frmd8 deficiency in mice accelerates azoxymethane/dextran-sodium-sulfate-induced colorectal adenoma formation. The FRMD8 promoter is hypermethylated, and low expression of FRMD8 predicts poor prognosis in CRC patients. Further, we identify an LKCHE-containing FRMD8 peptide that blocks MDM2 binding to RB and stabilizes RB. Combined application of the CDK4 inhibitor and FRMD8 peptide leads to marked suppression of CRC cell growth. Therefore, using an LKCHE-containing peptide to interfere with the MDM2-RB interaction may have therapeutic value in CDK4/6 inhibitor-resistant patients.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant RNA modifications are frequently associated with cancers, while the underlying mechanisms and clinical significance remain poorly understood. Here, we find that the ac4C RNA acetyltransferase NAT10 is significantly upregulated in esophageal cancers (ESCAs) and associated with poor ESCA prognosis. In addition, using ESCA cell lines and mouse models, we confirm the critical functions of NAT10 in promoting ESCA tumorigenesis and progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NAT10 depletion reduces the abundance of ac4C-modified tRNAs and decreases the translation efficiencies of mRNAs enriched for ac4C-modified tRNA-decoded codons. We further identify EGFR as a key downstream target that facilitates NAT10’s oncogenic functions. In terms of clinical significance, we demonstrate that NAT10 depletion and gefitinib treatment synergistically inhibit ESCA progression in vitro and in vivo. Our data indicate the mechanisms underlying ESCA progression at the layer of mRNA translation control and provide molecular insights for the development of effective cancer therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Gliomas are one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population. Two-thirds of AYA glioma patients are affected by low-grade gliomas (LGGs), but there are no specific treatments. Malignant progression is supported by the immunosuppressive stromal component of the tumor microenvironment (TME) exacerbated by M2 macrophages and a paucity of cytotoxic T cells. A single intravenous dose of engineered bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells that release interleukin-2 (GEMys-IL2) was used to treat mice with LGGs. Our results demonstrate that GEMys-IL2 crossed the blood-brain barrier, infiltrated the TME, and reprogrammed the immune cell composition and transcriptome. Moreover, GEMys-IL2 extended survival in an LGG immunocompetent mouse model. Here, we report the efficacy of an in vivo approach that demonstrates the potential for a cell-mediated innate immunotherapy designed to enhance the recruitment of activated effector T and natural killer cells within the glioma TME.

Abstract: Summary
Increasing plant resistance to Verticillium wilt (VW), which causes massive losses of Brassica rapa crops, is a challenge worldwide. However, few causal genes for VW resistance have been identified by forward genetic approaches, resulting in limited application in breeding. We combine a genome-wide association study in a natural population and quantitative trait locus mapping in an F2 population and identify that the MYB transcription factor BrMYB108 regulates plant resistance to VW. A 179 bp insertion in the BrMYB108 promoter alters its expression pattern during Verticillium longisporum (VL) infection. High BrMYB108 expression leads to high VL resistance, which is confirmed by disease resistance tests using BrMYB108 overexpression and loss-of-function mutants. Furthermore, we verify that BrMYB108 confers VL resistance by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation through binding to the promoters of respiratory burst oxidase genes (Rboh). A loss-of-function mutant of AtRbohF in Arabidopsis shows significant susceptibility to VL. Thus, BrMYB108 and its target ROS genes could be used as targets for genetic engineering for VL resistance of B. rapa.

Abstract: Summary
Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a significant concern due to persistent leukemia-initiating stem cells (LICs) that are typically not targeted by most existing therapies. Using a murine AML model, human AML cell lines, and patient samples, we show that AML LICs are sensitive to endogenous and exogenous cyclopentenone prostaglandin-J (CyPG), Δ12-PGJ2, and 15d-PGJ2, which are increased upon dietary selenium supplementation via the cyclooxygenase-hematopoietic PGD synthase pathway. CyPGs are endogenous ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and GPR44 (CRTH2; PTGDR2). Deletion of GPR44 in a mouse model of AML exacerbated the disease suggesting that GPR44 activation mediates selenium-mediated apoptosis of LICs. Transcriptomic analysis of GPR44−/− LICs indicated that GPR44 activation by CyPGs suppressed KRAS-mediated MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, to enhance apoptosis. Our studies show the role of GPR44, providing mechanistic underpinnings of the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties of selenium and CyPGs in AML.

Abstract: Purpose
As a noncanonical inflammatory kinase, IKBKE is frequently overexpressed and activated and has been identified as an oncogenic protein in glioblastoma. However, the potential function and underlying mechanism of IKBKE contributing to tumor angiogenesis remain elusive.
Methods
First, we analyzed the correlation between IKBKE and VEGF expression in glioma samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Second, HUVEC-related assays and Western blot were used to detect the regulatory effect of IKBKE on angiogenesis by modulating VEGF expression. Third, IKBKE depletion could alleviate the influence of VEGF expression on IHC of intracranial glioma model.
Results
We demonstrate that depletion of IKBKE markedly inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in glioblastoma. Mechanistically, IKBKE induces VEGF expression and secretion by regulating AKT/FOXO3a in glioblastoma.
Conclusions
This study reveals that IKBKE is a novel oncogenic molecule that induces angiogenesis through the promotion of VEGF expression and highlights the potential of targeting IKBKE for glioblastoma therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The choroid plexus (CP) is a source of trophic factors for the developing and mature brain. Insulin is produced in epithelial cells of the CP (EChPs), and its secretion is stimulated by Htr2c-mediated signaling. We modulated insulin expression in EChPs with intracerebroventricular injections of AAV5. Insulin overexpression in CP decelerates food intake, whereas its knockdown has the opposite effect. Insulin overexpression also results in reduced anxious behavior. Transcriptomic changes in the hypothalamus, especially in synapse-related processes, are also seen in mice overexpressing insulin in CP. Last, activation of Gq signaling in CP leads to acute Akt phosphorylation in neurons of the arcuate nucleus, indicating a direct action of CP-derived insulin on the hypothalamus. Taken together, our findings signify that CP is a relevant source of insulin in the central nervous system and that CP-derived insulin should be taken into consideration in future work pertaining to insulin actions in the brain.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the wound healing and antibacterial effects of two experimental copper dressings compared to a commercial silver dressing. Burn wounds were created in the ex vivo human skin biopsies, then were infected by Staphylococcus aureus. Tissues were treated with copper dressings, silver dressing, or a dressing without any antibacterial component. An infected wound tissue without treatment was considered as the control group. Three days after treatments, tissues were analyzed by bacterial count and histology staining, while their media was used to assess the expression of cytokines and chemokines. Histology staining confirmed the presence of second-degree burn wounds and colonization of bacteria in the surface and superficial layer of tissues. The results demonstrated a higher antibacterial effect, improved epithelium formation, and decreased wound area in one of the copper dressings compared to other dressings. Markers associated with infection control increased in both the copper and silver-treated groups. The cytokine profiling analysis revealed increased expression of markers related to angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory responses and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in the infected wound treated with one of the copper dressings. Our results confirmed the efficacy of the experimental copper dressing in reducing bacteria and promoting wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
African populations have been drastically underrepresented in genomics research, and failure to capture the genetic diversity across the numerous ethnolinguistic groups (ELGs) found on the continent has hindered the equity of precision medicine initiatives globally. Here, we describe the whole-genome sequencing of 449 Nigerian individuals across 47 unique self-reported ELGs. Population structure analysis reveals genetic differentiation among our ELGs, consistent with previous findings. From the 36 million SNPs and insertions or deletions (indels) discovered in our dataset, we provide a high-level catalog of both novel and medically relevant variation present across the ELGs. These results emphasize the value of this resource for genomics research, with added granularity by representing multiple ELGs from Nigeria. Our results also underscore the potential of using these cohorts with larger sample sizes to improve our understanding of human ancestry and health in Africa.

Abstract: Summary
Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are severe clinical disorders that mainly develop from viral respiratory infections, sepsis, and chest injury. Antigen-presenting cells play a pivotal role in propagating uncontrolled inflammation and injury through the excess secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of immune cells. Autophagy, a homeostatic process that involves the degradation of cellular components, is involved in many processes including lung inflammation. Here, we use a polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C))-induced lung injury mouse model to mimic viral-induced ALI/ARDS and show that disruption of autophagy in macrophages exacerbates lung inflammation and injury, whereas autophagy induction attenuates this process. Therefore, induction of autophagy in macrophages can be a promising therapeutic strategy in ALI/ARDS.

Abstract: Summary
Clostridioides difficile produces toxins that damage the colonic epithelium, causing colitis. Variation in disease severity is poorly understood and has been attributed to host factors and virulence differences between C. difficile strains. We test 23 epidemic ST1 C. difficile clinical isolates for their virulence in mice. All isolates encode a complete Tcd pathogenicity locus and achieve similar colonization densities. However, disease severity varies from lethal to avirulent infections. Genomic analysis of avirulent isolates reveals a 69-bp deletion in the cdtR gene, which encodes a response regulator for binary toxin expression. Deleting the 69-bp sequence in virulent R20291 strain renders it avirulent in mice with reduced toxin gene transcription. Our study demonstrates that a natural deletion within cdtR attenuates virulence in the epidemic ST1 C. difficile isolates without reducing colonization and persistence. Distinguishing strains on the basis of cdtR may enhance the specificity of diagnostic tests for C. difficile colitis.

Abstract: Summary
Neddylation is a post-translational mechanism that adds a ubiquitin-like protein, namely neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8). Here, we show that neddylation in mouse liver is modulated by nutrient availability. Inhibition of neddylation in mouse liver reduces gluconeogenic capacity and the hyperglycemic actions of counter-regulatory hormones. Furthermore, people with type 2 diabetes display elevated hepatic neddylation levels. Mechanistically, fasting or caloric restriction of mice leads to neddylation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1) at three lysine residues—K278, K342, and K387. We find that mutating the three PCK1 lysines that are neddylated reduces their gluconeogenic activity rate. Molecular dynamics simulations show that neddylation of PCK1 could re-position two loops surrounding the catalytic center into an open configuration, rendering the catalytic center more accessible. Our study reveals that neddylation of PCK1 provides a finely tuned mechanism of controlling glucose metabolism by linking whole nutrient availability to metabolic homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The somatic mutations found in a cancer genome are imprinted by different mutational processes. Each process exhibits a characteristic mutational signature, which can be affected by the genome architecture. However, the interplay between mutational signatures and topographical genomic features has not been extensively explored. Here, we integrate mutations from 5,120 whole-genome-sequenced tumors from 40 cancer types with 516 topographical features from ENCODE to evaluate the effect of nucleosome occupancy, histone modifications, CTCF binding, replication timing, and transcription/replication strand asymmetries on the cancer-specific accumulation of mutations from distinct mutagenic processes. Most mutational signatures are affected by topographical features, with signatures of related etiologies being similarly affected. Certain signatures exhibit periodic behaviors or cancer-type-specific enrichments/depletions near topographical features, revealing further information about the processes that imprinted them. Our findings, disseminated via the COSMIC (Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) signatures database, provide a comprehensive online resource for exploring the interactions between mutational signatures and topographical features across human cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The adaptive increase in insulin secretion in early stages of obesity serves as a safeguard mechanism to maintain glucose homeostasis that cannot be sustained, and the eventual decompensation of β cells is a key event in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Here we describe a crucial system orchestrated by a transcriptional cofactor CtBP2. In cultured β cells, insulin gene expression is coactivated by CtBP2. Global genomic mapping of CtBP2 binding sites identifies a key interaction between CtBP2 and NEUROD1 through which CtBP2 decompacts chromatin in the insulin gene promoter. CtBP2 expression is diminished in pancreatic islets in multiple mouse models of obesity, as well as human obesity. Pancreatic β cell-specific CtBP2-deficient mice manifest glucose intolerance with impaired insulin secretion. Our transcriptome analysis highlights an essential role of CtBP2 in the maintenance of β cell integrity. This system provides clues to the molecular basis in obesity and may be targetable to develop therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Peroxiredoxins (Prdxs) utilize reversibly oxidized cysteine residues to reduce peroxides and promote H2O2 signal transduction, including H2O2-induced activation of P38 MAPK. Prdxs form H2O2-induced disulfide complexes with many proteins, including multiple kinases involved in P38 MAPK signaling. Here, we show that a genetically encoded fusion between a Prdx and P38 MAPK is sufficient to hyperactivate the kinase in yeast and human cells by a mechanism that does not require the H2O2-sensing cysteine of the Prdx. We demonstrate that a P38-Prdx fusion protein compensates for loss of the yeast scaffold protein Mcs4 and MAP3K activity, driving yeast into mitosis. Based on our findings, we propose that the H2O2-induced formation of Prdx-MAPK disulfide complexes provides an alternative scaffold and signaling platform for MAPKK-MAPK signaling. The demonstration that formation of a complex with a Prdx is sufficient to modify the activity of a kinase has broad implications for peroxide-based signal transduction in eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) are hexamers of LRRC8 proteins that are crucial for cell volume regulation. N termini (NTs) of the obligatory LRRC8A subunit modulate VRACs activation and ion selectivity, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report a 2.8-Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of human LRRC8A that displays well-resolved NTs. Amino-terminal halves of NTs fold back into the pore and constrict the permeation path, thereby determining ion selectivity together with an extracellular selectivity filter with which it works in series. They also interact with pore-surrounding helices and support their compact arrangement. The C-terminal halves of NTs interact with intracellular loops that are crucial for channel activation. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that low ionic strength increases NT mobility and expands the radial distance between pore-surrounding helices. Our work suggests an unusual pore architecture with two selectivity filters in series and a mechanism for VRAC activation by cell swelling.

Abstract: Summary
Cell cycle progression is linked to transcriptome dynamics and variations in the response of pluripotent cells to differentiation cues, mostly through unknown determinants. Here, we characterized the cell-cycle-associated transcriptome and proteome of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in naive ground state. We found that the thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is a cell-cycle-regulated co-factor of the tumor suppressor p53. Furthermore, TDG and p53 co-bind ESC-specific cis-regulatory elements and thereby control transcription of p53-dependent genes during self-renewal. We determined that the dynamic expression of TDG is required to promote the cell-cycle-associated transcriptional heterogeneity. Moreover, we demonstrated that transient depletion of TDG influences cell fate decisions during the early differentiation of mESCs. Our findings reveal an unanticipated role of TDG in promoting molecular heterogeneity during the cell cycle and highlight the central role of protein dynamics for the temporal control of cell fate during development.

Abstract: The current investigation was considered to evaluate the beneficial effects of gentisic acid (GA) on gentamicin (GEN)-induced nephrotoxicity in rat kidneys through assessment of oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, and histopathological changes. Rats were split into five equal groups. Rats were treated with GA (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 14 consecutive days and GEN (100 mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated from day 8 to day 14 of the experiment. On the 15th day, blood samples were collected to determine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) levels. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and nitric oxide (NO) levels and the activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were assessed in the renal tissue. Histopathological evaluations were done to confirm the biochemical results. GEN increased the levels of NGAL, KIM-1, BUN, and Cr in serum as well as MDA, NO, GSH, TNF-α, and IL-1β in renal tissue. Moreover, GEN administration reduced the activity of CAT, SOD, and GPx in renal tissue. Nonetheless, the administration of GA before and alongside GEN mitigated these deleterious effects. In conclusion, GA has a beneficial effect on biochemical, inflammatory, and oxidative stress indices against GEN-induced nephrotoxicity.

Abstract: Objective
Decellularization is the process to obtain natural scaffolds with tissue integrity and extracellular matrix components, and recellularization is used to produce tissue-like constructs with specific cell types. In this study, rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBM-MSCs) were cultured on decellularized heart extracellular matrix. These cells were then induced to differentiate into cardiomyogenic cells under the stimulatory effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other chemicals. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the cardiac extracellular matrix and VEGF on cardiomyogenic differentiation in the context of the Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways.
Methods
Heart samples extracted from rats were decellularized by serial application of detergent to remove cells from the tissue, and then recellularized with rBM-MSCs. The recellularized tissue matrices were then analyzed for cardiomyogenesis. Cardiomyogenic differentiation was performed on decellularized heart extracellular matrix (ECM; three-dimensional scaffolds) and culture plates (two-dimensional cell culture system) for 28 days to understand the effects of the heart extracellular matrix. In addition, differentiation was induced with and without the stimulatory effect of VEGF to understand the effect of VEGF on cardiomyogenic differentiation of rBM-MSCs.
Results
Immunofluorescence staining showed that decellularization of the heart was performed effectively and successfully. After decellularization process, the heart extracellular matrix was completely free of cells. It was observed that rBM-MSCs transplanted onto the heart extracellular matrix remained viable and proliferated for 21 days after recellularization. The rBM-MSCs promoted cardiomyogenic differentiation in the conventional differentiation medium but were inversely affected by both VEGF and heart extracellular matrix proteins. Lower expression of connexin43 and cardiac troponin I genes was observed in cells induced by either matrix proteins or VEGF, compared to cells differentiated by chemical agents alone.
Conclusion
In this study, we investigated the effect of decellularized heart extracellular matrix and VEGF on cardiomyogenic differentiation of rBM-MSCs. On the decellularized cardiac extracellular matrix, rBM-MSCs maintained their viability by adhering to the matrix and proliferating further. The adhesion of the cells to the matrix also produced a physical stimulus that led to the formation of histological structures resembling myocardial layers. Chemical stimulation of the decellularized heart extracellular matrix and cardiomyogenic differentiation supplements resulted in increased expression of cardiomyogenic biomarkers through modulation of the Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue-wide patterning is essential to multicellular development, requiring cells to individually generate polarity axes and coordinate them in space and time with neighbors. Using the C. elegans intestinal epithelium, we identified a patterning mechanism that is informed by cell contact lifetime asymmetry and executed via the scaffolding protein PAR-3 and the transmembrane protein E-cadherin/HMR-1. Intestinal cells break symmetry as PAR-3 and HMR-1 recruit apical determinants into punctate “local polarity complexes” (LPCs) at homotypic contacts. LPCs undergo an HMR-1-based migration to a common midline, thereby establishing tissue-wide polarity. Thus, symmetry breaking results from PAR-3-dependent intracellular polarization coupled to HMR-1-based tissue-level communication, which occurs through a non-adhesive signaling role for HMR-1. Differential lifetimes between homotypic and heterotypic cell contacts are created by neighbor exchanges and oriented divisions, patterning where LPCs perdure and thereby breaking symmetry. These cues offer a logical and likely conserved framework for how epithelia without obvious molecular asymmetries can polarize.

Abstract: Summary
Secondary infection in patients with sepsis triggers a new wave of inflammatory response, which aggravates organ injury and increases mortality. Trained immunity boosts a potent and nonspecific response to the secondary challenge and has been considered beneficial for the host. Here, using a murine model of polymicrobial infection, we find that the primary infection reprograms granulocytes to boost enhanced inflammatory responses to the secondary infection, including the excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, respiratory burst, and augmented phagocytosis capacity. However, these reprogramed granulocytes exhibit “non-classic” characteristics of innate immune memory. Two mechanisms are independently involved in the innate immune memory of granulocytes: a metabolic shift in favor of glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis and chromatin remodeling leading to the transcriptional inactivity of genes encoding inhibitors of TLR4-initiated signaling pathways. Counteracting the deleterious effects of stressed granulocytes on anti-infection immunity might provide a strategy to fight secondary infections during sepsis.

Abstract: Summary
Refractory and relapsed B cell lymphomas are often driven by the difficult-to-target oncogene MYC. Here, we report that high MYC expression stimulates proliferation and protects B lymphoma cells from apoptosis under normal oxidative stress levels and that compounds including N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin C (VitC) induce apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress. NAC and VitC injections effectively reduce tumor growth in lymphoma cells with high MYC expression but not in those with low MYC expression. MYC knockdown confers tumor resistance to NAC and VitC, while MYC activation renders B cells sensitive to these compounds. Mechanistically, NAC and VitC stimulate MYC binding to EGR1 through Cys117 of MYC, shifting its transcriptional output from cell cycle to apoptosis gene expression. These results identify a redox-controlled mechanism for MYC’s role in maintaining proliferation and preventing apoptosis, offering a potential therapeutic rationale for evaluating NAC or VitC in patients with MYC-driven B cell lymphoma.

Abstract: Summary
The China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) is a population-based prospective cohort of >512,000 adults recruited from 2004 to 2008 from 10 geographically diverse regions across China. Detailed data from questionnaires and physical measurements were collected at baseline, with additional measurements at three resurveys involving ∼5% of surviving participants. Analyses of genome-wide genotyping, for >100,000 participants using custom-designed Axiom arrays, reveal extensive relatedness, recent consanguinity, and signatures reflecting large-scale population movements from recent Chinese history. Systematic genome-wide association studies of incident disease, captured through electronic linkage to death and disease registries and to the national health insurance system, replicate established disease loci and identify 14 novel disease associations. Together with studies of candidate drug targets and disease risk factors and contributions to international genetics consortia, these demonstrate the breadth, depth, and quality of the CKB data. Ongoing high-throughput omics assays of collected biosamples and planned whole-genome sequencing will further enhance the scientific value of this biobank.

Abstract: Summary
We characterized a prospective endometrial carcinoma (EC) cohort containing 138 tumors and 20 enriched normal tissues using 10 different omics platforms. Targeted quantitation of two peptides can predict antigen processing and presentation machinery activity, and may inform patient selection for immunotherapy. Association analysis between MYC activity and metformin treatment in both patients and cell lines suggests a potential role for metformin treatment in non-diabetic patients with elevated MYC activity. PIK3R1 in-frame indels are associated with elevated AKT phosphorylation and increased sensitivity to AKT inhibitors. CTNNB1 hotspot mutations are concentrated near phosphorylation sites mediating pS45-induced degradation of β-catenin, which may render Wnt-FZD antagonists ineffective. Deep learning accurately predicts EC subtypes and mutations from histopathology images, which may be useful for rapid diagnosis. Overall, this study identified molecular and imaging markers that can be further investigated to guide patient stratification for more precise treatment of EC.

Abstract: Summary
Identities of distinct neuron subtypes are specified during embryonic development, then maintained during post-natal maturation. In cerebral cortex, mechanisms controlling early acquisition of neuron-subtype identities have become increasingly understood. However, mechanisms controlling neuron-subtype identity stability during post-natal maturation are largely unexplored. We identify that Tle4 is required for both early acquisition and post-natal stability of corticothalamic neuron-subtype identity. Embryonically, Tle4 promotes acquisition of corticothalamic identity and blocks emergence of core characteristics of subcerebral/corticospinal projection neuron identity, including gene expression and connectivity. During the first post-natal week, when corticothalamic innervation is ongoing, Tle4 is required to stabilize corticothalamic neuron identity, limiting interference from differentiation programs of developmentally related neuron classes. We identify a deacetylation-based epigenetic mechanism by which TLE4 controls Fezf2 expression level by corticothalamic neurons. This contributes to distinction of cortical output subtypes and ensures identity stability for appropriate maturation of corticothalamic neurons.

CD8+ T cell exhaustion (TEX) impairs the ability of T cells to clear chronic infection or cancer. While TEX are hypofunctional, some TEX retain effector gene signatures, a feature associated with killer lectin-like receptor (KLR) expression. Although KLR+ TEX (TKLR) may improve control of chronic antigen, the signaling molecules regulating this population are poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), flow cytometry, RNA velocity, and single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq), we demonstrate that deleting the pseudokinase Trib1 shifts TEX toward CX3CR1+ intermediates with robust enrichment of TKLR via clonal T cell expansion. Adoptive transfer studies demonstrate this shift toward CD8+ TKLR in Trib1-deficient cells is CD8 intrinsic, while CD4-depletion studies demonstrate CD4+ T cells are required for improved viral control in Trib1 conditional knockout mice. Further, Trib1 loss augments anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade to improve viral clearance. These data identify Trib1 as an important regulator of CD8+ TEX whose targeting enhances the TKLR effector state and improves checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The co-inhibitory programmed death (PD)-1 signaling pathway plays a major role in the context of tumor-specific T cell responses. Conversely, it also contributes to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance, as patients receiving anti-PD-1 treatment are prone to developing immune-related adverse events. Yet, the physiological role of the PD-1/PDL-1 axis in T cell homeostasis is still poorly understood. Herein, we show that under steady-state conditions, the absence of PD-1 signaling led to a preferential expansion of CD8+ T cells in the liver. These cells exhibit an oligoclonal T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and a terminally differentiated exhaustion profile. The transcription factor EOMES is required for the clonal expansion and acquisition of this differentiation program. Finally, single-cell transcriptomics coupled with TCR repertoire analysis support the notion that these cells arise locally from liver-resident memory CD8+ T cells. Overall, we show a role for PD-1 signaling in liver memory T cell homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
A previously undescribed mechanism underlying butterfly wing coloration patterns was discovered in two distantly related butterfly species, Siproeta stelenes and Philaethria diatonica. These butterflies have bright green wings, but the color pattern is not derived from solid pigments or nanostructures of the scales or from the color of the cuticular membrane but rather from a liquid retained in the wing membrane. Wing structure differs between the green and non-green areas. In the non-green region, the upper and lower cuticular membranes are attached to each other, whereas in the green region, we observed a space of 5–10 μm where green liquid is held and living cells are present. A pigment analysis and tracer experiment revealed that the color of the liquid is derived from hemolymph components, bilin and carotenoid pigments. This discovery broadens our understanding of the diverse ways in which butterfly wings obtain their coloration and patterns.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic KRASG12D (KRAS∗) is critical for the initiation and maintenance of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and is a known repressor of tumor immunity. Conditional elimination of KRAS∗ in genetic mouse models of PDAC leads to the reactivation of FAS, CD8+ T cell-mediated apoptosis, and complete eradication of tumors. KRAS∗ elimination recruits activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and promotes the activation of antigen-presenting cells. Mechanistically, KRAS∗-mediated immune evasion involves the epigenetic regulation of Fas death receptor in cancer cells, via methylation of its promoter region. Furthermore, analysis of human RNA sequencing identifies that high KRAS expression in PDAC tumors shows a lower proportion of CD8+ T cells and demonstrates shorter survival compared with tumors with low KRAS expression. This study highlights the role of CD8+ T cells in the eradication of PDAC following KRAS∗ elimination and provides a rationale for the combination of KRAS∗ targeting with immunotherapy to control PDAC.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue fluidification and collective motility are pivotal in regulating embryonic morphogenesis, wound healing, and tumor metastasis. These processes frequently require that each cell constituent of a tissue coordinates its migration activity and directed motion through the oriented extension of lamellipodium cell protrusions, promoted by RAC1 activity. While the upstream RAC1 regulators in individual migratory cells or leader cells during invasion or wound healing are well characterized, how RAC1 is controlled in follower cells remains unknown. Here, we identify a MYO6-DOCK7 axis essential for spatially restricting RAC1 activity in a planar polarized fashion in model tissue monolayers. The MYO6-DOCK7 axis specifically controls the extension of cryptic lamellipodia required to drive tissue fluidification and cooperative-mode motion in otherwise solid and static carcinoma cell collectives.

Abstract: Summary
Inadequate remnant volume and regenerative ability of the liver pose life-threatening risks to patients after partial liver transplantation (PLT) or partial hepatectomy (PHx), while few clinical treatments focus on safely accelerating regeneration. Recently, we discovered that supplementing 5-aminolevulinate (5-ALA) improves liver cold adaptation and functional recovery, leading us to uncover a correlation between 5-ALA metabolic activities and post-PLT recovery. In a mouse 2/3 PHx model, 5-ALA supplements enhanced liver regeneration, promoting infiltration and polarization of anti-inflammatory macrophages via P53 signaling. Intriguingly, chemokine receptor CX3CR1 functions to counterbalance these effects. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of CX3CR1 (AZD8797; phase II trial candidate) augmented the macrophagic production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and subsequent hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) production by hepatic stellate cells. Thus, short-term treatments with both 5-ALA and AZD8797 demonstrated pro-regeneration outcomes superior to 5-ALA-only treatments in mice after PHx. Overall, our findings may inspire safe and effective strategies to better treat PLT and PHx patients.

Abstract: Summary
The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease SENP6 disassembles SUMO chains from cellular substrate proteins. We use a proteomic method to identify putative SENP6 substrates based on increased apparent molecular weight after SENP6 depletion. Proteins of the lamin family of intermediate filaments show substantially increased SUMO modification after SENP6 depletion. This is accompanied by nuclear structural changes remarkably like those associated with laminopathies. Two SUMO attachment sites on lamin A/C are close to sites of mutations in Emery-Driefuss and limb girdle muscular dystrophy. To establish a direct link between lamin SUMOylation and the observed phenotype, we developed proximity-induced SUMO modification (PISM), which fuses a lamin A/C targeting DARPin to a SUMO E3 ligase domain. This directly targets lamin A/C for SUMO conjugation and demonstrates that enhanced lamin SUMO modification recapitulates the altered nuclear structure manifest after SENP6 depletion. This shows SENP6 activity protects the nucleus against hyperSUMOylation-induced laminopathy-like alterations.

Abstract: Summary
Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) facilitates replication over damaged or difficult-to-replicate templates by employing specialized DNA polymerases. We investigate the effect on spontaneous mutagenesis of three main TLS control mechanisms: REV1 and PCNA ubiquitylation that recruit TLS polymerases and PRIMPOL that creates post-replicative gaps. Using whole-genome sequencing of cultured human RPE-1 cell clones, we find that REV1 and Polymerase ζ are wholly responsible for one component of base substitution mutagenesis that resembles homologous recombination deficiency, whereas the remaining component that approximates oxidative mutagenesis is reduced in PRIMPOL−/− cells. Small deletions in short repeats appear in REV1−/− PCNAK164R/K164R double mutants, revealing an alternative TLS mechanism. Also, 500–5,000 bp deletions appear in REV1−/− and REV3L−/− mutants, and chromosomal instability is detectable in REV1−/− PRIMPOL−/− cells. Our results indicate that TLS protects the genome from deletions and large rearrangements at the expense of being responsible for the majority of spontaneous base substitutions.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates global protein synthesis through inactivation of eIF4E-binding proteins (m4E-BPs) in response to nutrient and energy availability. Until now, 4E-BPs have been considered as metazoan inventions, and how target of rapamycin (TOR) controls cap-dependent translation initiation in plants remains obscure. Here, we present short unstructured 4E-BP-like Arabidopsis proteins (4EBP1/4EBP2) that are non-homologous to m4E-BPs except for the eIF4E-binding motif and TOR phosphorylation sites. Unphosphorylated 4EBPs exhibit strong affinity toward eIF4Es and can inhibit formation of the cap-binding complex. Upon TOR activation, 4EBPs are phosphorylated, probably when bound directly to TOR, and likely relocated to ribosomes. 4EBPs can suppress a distinct set of mRNAs; 4EBP2 predominantly inhibits translation of core cell-cycle regulators CycB1;1 and CycD1;1, whereas 4EBP1 interferes with chlorophyll biosynthesis. Accordingly, 4EBP2 overexpression halts early seedling development, which is overcome by induction of Glc/Suc-TOR signaling. Thus, TOR regulates cap-dependent translation initiation by inactivating atypical 4EBPs in plants.

Abstract: Summary
Self-antigen-specific T cells are prevalent in the mature adaptive immune system but are regulated through multiple mechanisms of tolerance. However, inflammatory conditions such as tissue injury may allow these T cells to break tolerance and trigger autoimmunity. To understand how the T cell repertoire responds to the presentation of self-antigen under highly stimulatory conditions, we use peptide:major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II tetramers to track the behavior of endogenous CD4+ T cells with specificity to a lung-expressed self-antigen in mouse models of immune-mediated lung injury. Acute injury results in the exclusive expansion of CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) that is dependent on self-antigen recognition and interleukin-2 (IL-2). Conversely, conventional CD4+ T cells of the same self-antigen specificity remain unresponsive even following Treg ablation. Thus, the self-antigen-specific CD4+ T cell repertoire is poised to serve a regulatory function during acute tissue damage to limit further damage and the possibility of autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
Bioconversion of lignin-related aromatic compounds relies on robust catabolic pathways in microbes. Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 (SYK-6) is a well-characterized aromatic catabolic organism that has served as a model for microbial lignin conversion, and its utility as a biocatalyst could potentially be further improved by genome-wide metabolic analyses. To this end, we generate a randomly barcoded transposon insertion mutant (RB-TnSeq) library to study gene function in SYK-6. The library is enriched under dozens of enrichment conditions to quantify gene fitness. Several known aromatic catabolic pathways are confirmed, and RB-TnSeq affords additional detail on the genome-wide effects of each enrichment condition. Selected genes are further examined in SYK-6 or Pseudomonas putida KT2440, leading to the identification of new gene functions. The findings from this study further elucidate the metabolism of SYK-6, while also providing targets for future metabolic engineering in this organism or other hosts for the biological valorization of lignin.

Abstract: Summary
The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is largely attributed to its ability to physiologically adapt and withstand diverse localized stresses within host microenvironments. Here, we present a data-driven model (EGRIN 2.0) that captures the dynamic interplay of environmental cues and genome-encoded regulatory programs in Mtb. Analysis of EGRIN 2.0 shows how modulation of the MtrAB two-component signaling system tunes Mtb growth in response to related host microenvironmental cues. Disruption of MtrAB by tunable CRISPR interference confirms that the signaling system regulates multiple peptidoglycan hydrolases, among other targets, that are important for cell division. Further, MtrA decreases the effectiveness of antibiotics by mechanisms of both intrinsic resistance and drug tolerance. Together, the model-enabled dissection of complex MtrA regulation highlights its importance as a drug target and illustrates how EGRIN 2.0 facilitates discovery and mechanistic characterization of Mtb adaptation to specific host microenvironments within the host.

Abstract: Summary
During eukaryotic DNA replication, Pol α-primase generates primers at replication origins to start leading-strand synthesis and every few hundred nucleotides during discontinuous lagging-strand replication. How Pol α-primase is targeted to replication forks to prime DNA synthesis is not fully understood. Here, by determining cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of budding yeast and human replisomes containing Pol α-primase, we reveal a conserved mechanism for the coordination of priming by the replisome. Pol α-primase binds directly to the leading edge of the CMG (CDC45-MCM-GINS) replicative helicase via a complex interaction network. The non-catalytic PRIM2/Pri2 subunit forms two interfaces with CMG that are critical for in vitro DNA replication and yeast cell growth. These interactions position the primase catalytic subunit PRIM1/Pri1 directly above the exit channel for lagging-strand template single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), revealing why priming occurs efficiently only on the lagging-strand template and elucidating a mechanism for Pol α-primase to overcome competition from RPA to initiate primer synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Acquisition of neuronal circuit architectures, central to understanding brain function and dysfunction, remains prohibitively challenging. Here I report the development of a simultaneous and sequential octuple-sexdecuple whole-cell patch-clamp recording system that enables architectural reconstruction of complex cortical circuits. The method unveils the canonical layer 1 single bouquet cell (SBC)-led disinhibitory neuronal circuits across the mouse somatosensory, motor, prefrontal, and medial entorhinal cortices. The ∼1,500-neuron modular circuits feature the translaminar, unidirectional, minicolumnar, and independent disinhibition and optimize cortical complexity, subtlety, plasticity, variation, and redundancy. Moreover, architectural reconstruction uncovers age-dependent deficits at SBC-disinhibited synapses in the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8, an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease. The deficits exhibit the characteristic Alzheimer’s-like cortical spread and correlation with cognitive impairments. These findings decrypt operations of the elementary processing units in healthy and Alzheimer’s mouse cortices and validate the efficacy of octuple-sexdecuple patch-clamp recordings for architectural reconstruction of complex neuronal circuits.

Abstract: Summary
Fanconi anemia (FA) signaling, a key genomic maintenance pathway, is activated in response to replication stress. Here, we report that phosphorylation of the pivotal pathway protein FANCD2 by CHK1 triggers its FBXL12-dependent proteasomal degradation, facilitating FANCD2 clearance at stalled replication forks. This promotes efficient DNA replication under conditions of CYCLIN E- and drug-induced replication stress. Reconstituting FANCD2-deficient fibroblasts with phosphodegron mutants failed to re-establish fork progression. In the absence of FBXL12, FANCD2 becomes trapped on chromatin, leading to replication stress and excessive DNA damage. In human cancers, FBXL12, CYCLIN E, and FA signaling are positively correlated, and FBXL12 upregulation is linked to reduced survival in patients with high CYCLIN E-expressing breast tumors. Finally, depletion of FBXL12 exacerbated oncogene-induced replication stress and sensitized cancer cells to drug-induced replication stress by WEE1 inhibition. Collectively, our results indicate that FBXL12 constitutes a vulnerability and a potential therapeutic target in CYCLIN E-overexpressing cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Controlled release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) is crucial for gene regulation. However, studying RNA Pol II pausing is challenging, as pause-release factors are almost all essential. In this study, we identified heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SUPT5H, which encodes SPT5, in individuals with β-thalassemia. During erythropoiesis in healthy human cells, cell cycle genes were highly paused as cells transition from progenitors to precursors. When the pathogenic mutations were recapitulated by SUPT5H editing, RNA Pol II pause release was globally disrupted, and as cells began transitioning from progenitors to precursors, differentiation was delayed, accompanied by a transient lag in erythroid-specific gene expression and cell cycle kinetics. Despite this delay, cells terminally differentiate, and cell cycle phase distributions normalize. Therefore, hindering pause release perturbs proliferation and differentiation dynamics at a key transition during erythropoiesis, identifying a role for RNA Pol II pausing in temporally coordinating the cell cycle and erythroid differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
DNA damage-activated signaling pathways are critical for coordinating multiple cellular processes, which must be tightly regulated to maintain genome stability. To provide a comprehensive and unbiased perspective of DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathways, we performed 30 fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based genome-wide CRISPR screens in human cell lines with antibodies recognizing distinct endogenous DNA damage signaling proteins to identify critical regulators involved in DDR. We discovered that proteasome-mediated processing is an early and prerequisite event for cells to trigger camptothecin- and etoposide-induced DDR signaling. Furthermore, we identified PRMT1 and PRMT5 as modulators that regulate ATM protein level. Moreover, we discovered that GNB1L is a key regulator of DDR signaling via its role as a co-chaperone specifically regulating PIKK proteins. Collectively, these screens offer a rich resource for further investigation of DDR, which may provide insight into strategies of targeting these DDR pathways to improve therapeutic outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Most mutations in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) arise in rod photoreceptors, but cone photoreceptors, responsible for high-resolution daylight and color vision, are subsequently affected, causing the most debilitating features of the disease. We used mass spectroscopy to follow 13C metabolites delivered to the outer retina and single-cell RNA sequencing to assess photoreceptor transcriptomes. The S cone metabolic transcriptome suggests engagement of the TCA cycle and ongoing response to ROS characteristic of oxidative phosphorylation, which we link to their histone modification transcriptome. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and its downstream effector RIP3, which drive ROS generation via mitochondrial dysfunction, are induced and activated as S cones undergo early apoptosis in RP. The long/medium-wavelength (L/M) cone transcriptome shows enhanced glycolytic capacity, which maintains their function as RP progresses. Then, as extracellular glucose eventually diminishes, L/M cones are sustained in long-term dormancy by lactate metabolism.
