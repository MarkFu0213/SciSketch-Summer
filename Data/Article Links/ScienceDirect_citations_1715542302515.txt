Abstract: Persistent apical periodontitis (PAP) is characterized by refractory inflammation and progressive bone destruction. Enterococcus faecalis infection is considered an important etiological factor for the development of PAP, although the exact mechanisms remain unknown. This study aimed at investigating the role of E. faecalis in cell proliferation, inflammatory reactions and osteoclast differentiation of macrophages using an in vitro infection model of osteoclast precursor RAW264.7 cells. A cell viability assay of cultured RAW264.7 cells exposed to live E. faecalis at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 2h, indicated that the infection exhibited no cytotoxic effect. Transmission electron microscopy images revealed no apoptotic changes but a rise of metabolic activity and phagocytic features in the infected RAW264.7 cells. Confocal laser scanning microscopic and flow cytometric analysis indicated that the phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cells was activated by E. faecalis infection. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR assays demonstrated that the expression of inflammatory cytokines was remarkably elevated in infected RAW264.7 cells. Differentiation of infected RAW264.7 cells into osteoclasts was remarkably attenuated, and expression of osteoclast marker genes as well as fusogenic genes significantly dropped. In summary, E. faecalis appears to attenuate osteoclastic differentiation of RAW264.7 precursor cells, rather stimulates them to function as macrophages.

Abstract: The main problem in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is metastasis. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known as the critical signaling in tumor progression, metastasis, and also the drug resistance. In this study, we reported a novel gene Polymerase delta-interacting protein 2 (POLDIP2) was downregulated in NSCLC tissues and first demonstrated that overexpression of POLDIP2 increased the anchorage-independent growth (AIG) and invasiveness of H1299 cells. In addition, we examined that knockdown of POLDIP2 in H1299 and A549 cells reduced tumorigenicity and metastatic capacity in vitro and also in vivo. Moreover, downregulation of the cell proliferation marker cyclin D1 and EMT markers CDH2, Slug, and Twist was showed in H1299 cells by POLDIP2 knockdown, suggesting that the inhibition of malignancy was affected by modulating key genes for tumor growth and invasiveness. Taken together, our study is the first study that demonstrated that POLDIP2 gene was function as an oncogene in NSCLC and implied the oncogenic ability might be through promoting cell proliferation or EMT.

Abstract: Chagasic cardiomyopathy (CC) is the main manifestation of Chagas Disease (CD). CC is a progressive dysfunctional illness, in which transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) plays a central role in fibrogenesis and hypertrophy. In the present study, we tested in a three-dimensional (3D) model of cardiac cells culture (named cardiac spheroids), capable of mimicking the aspects of fibrosis and hypertrophy observed in CC, the role of TGF-β pathway inhibition in restoring extracellular matrix (ECM) balance disrupted by T. cruzi infection. Treatment of T. cruzi-infected cardiac spheroids with SB 431542, a selective inhibitor of TGF-β type I receptor, resulted in a reduction in the size of spheroids, which was accompanied by a decrease in parasite load and in fibronectin expression. The inhibition of TGF-β pathway also promoted an increase in the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and a decrease in tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 expression, which may be one of the mechanisms regulating extracellular matrix remodeling. Therefore, our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which inhibition of TGF-β signaling reverts fibrosis and hypertrophy generated by T. cruzi during CC and also highlights the use of cardiac spheroids as a valuable tool for the study of fibrogenesis and anti-fibrotic compounds.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two neurodegenerative diseases in which similar pathogenic mechanisms are involved. Both diseases associate to the high propensity of specific misfolded proteins, like TDP-43 or FUS, to mislocalize and aggregate. This is partly due to their intrinsic biophysical properties and partly as a consequence of failure of the neuronal protein quality control (PQC) system. Several familial ALS/FTD cases are linked to an expansion of a repeated G4C2 hexanucleotide sequence present in the C9ORF72 gene. The G4C2, which localizes in an untranslated region of the C9ORF72 transcript, drives an unconventional repeat-associated ATG-independent translation. This leads to the synthesis of five different dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), which are not “classical” misfolded proteins, but generate aberrant aggregation-prone unfolded conformations poorly removed by the PQC system. The DPRs accumulate into p62/SQSTM1 and ubiquitin positive inclusions. Here, we analyzed the biochemical behavior of the five DPRs in immortalized motoneurons. Our data suggest that while the DPRs are mainly processed via autophagy, this system is unable to fully clear their aggregated forms, and thus they tend to accumulate in basal conditions. Overexpression of the small heat shock protein B8 (HSPB8), which facilitates the autophagy-mediated disposal of a large variety of classical misfolded aggregation-prone proteins, significantly decreased the accumulation of most DPR insoluble species. Thus, the induction of HSPB8 might represent a valid approach to decrease DPR-mediated toxicity and maintain motoneuron viability.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) constitutes a significant public health burden, and currently available treatment options are not generally curative, necessitating the development of new therapeutics. Here we have applied random non-standard peptide integrated discovery (RaPID) screening to identify small macrocyclic peptide inhibitors of HBV entry that target the cell-surface receptor for HBV, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). In addition to their anti-HBV activity, these molecules also inhibit cellular entry by the related hepatitis D virus (HDV), and are active against diverse strains of HBV (including clinically relevant nucleos(t)ide analog-resistant and vaccine escaping strains). Importantly, these macrocyclic peptides, in contrast to other NTCP-binding HBV entry inhibitors, exhibited no inhibition of NTCP-mediated bile acid uptake, making them appealing candidates for therapeutic development.

Abstract: Summary
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) penetrates the blood-brain barrier, but it is unknown whether AAV penetrates other tight junctions. Genetic manipulation of testis has been hampered by the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules and the blood-testis barrier (BTB), which forms between Sertoli cells and divides the tubules into basal and adluminal compartments. Here, we demonstrate in vivo genetic manipulation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and their microenvironment via AAV1/9. AAV1/9 microinjected into the seminiferous tubules penetrated both the basement membrane and BTB, thereby transducing not only Sertoli cells and SSCs but also peritubular cells and Leydig cells. Moreover, when congenitally infertile KitlSl/KitlSl-d mouse testes with defective Sertoli cells received Kitl-expressing AAVs, spermatogenesis regenerated and offspring were produced. None of the offspring contained the AAV genome. Thus, AAV1/9 allows efficient germline and niche manipulation by penetrating the BTB and basement membrane, providing a promising strategy for the development of gene therapies for reproductive defects.

Abstract: A high-sugar diet (HSD) induces Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, which severely threaten human health. The Drosophila T2D model has been constructed to study the mechanisms of insulin resistance, diet-induced cardiovascular diseases and other conditions. Innate immunity is the first line of defense against invading pathogens and parasites. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between a HSD and the innate immune response in Drosophila. In this study, we fed flies a high-sucrose diet and observed defects in the phagocytosis of latex beads and B. bassiana spores. The actin cytoskeleton was also disrupted in hemocytes from HSD-fed larvae. Furthermore, HSD induced the differentiation of lamellocytes in the lymph gland and circulating hemolymph, which rarely occurs in healthy bodies, via JNK signaling. In addition, the Toll and JNK pathways were excessively activated in the fat bodies of HSD-fed larvae, and a large number of dead cells were observed. Finally, HSD induced the aberrant activation of the innate immune system, including inflammation. Our results have established a connection between T2D and the innate immune response.

Abstract: Summary
In mouse, although four Argonaute (AGO) proteins with partly overlapping functions in small-RNA pathways exist, only Ago2 deficiency causes embryonic lethality. To investigate the role of AGO2 during mouse early development, we generated Ago2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and performed a detailed characterization of their differentiation potential. Ago2 disruption caused a global reduction of microRNAs, which resulted in the misregulation of only a limited number of transcripts. We demonstrated, both in vivo and in vitro, that AGO2 is dispensable for the embryonic germ-layer formation. However, Ago2-deficient mESCs showed a specific defect during conversion into extra-embryonic endoderm cells. We proved that this defect is cell autonomous and can be rescued by both a catalytically active and an inactive Ago2, but not by Ago2 deprived of its RNA binding capacity or by Ago1 overexpression. Overall, our results suggest a role for AGO2 in stem cell differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal epithelial cells are the first line of defense against enteric pathogens, yet bacterial pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, can breach this barrier. We show that Listeria adhesion protein (LAP) induces intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction to promote bacterial translocation. These disruptions are attributed to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, which is observed in mice challenged with WT and isogenic strains lacking the surface invasion protein Internalin A (ΔinlA), but not a lap— mutant. Additionally, upon engagement of its surface receptor Hsp60, LAP activates canonical NF-κB signaling, facilitating myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK)-mediated opening of the epithelial barrier via cellular redistribution of the epithelial junctional proteins claudin-1, occludin, and E-cadherin. Pharmacological inhibition of MLCK or NF-κB in cells or genetic ablation of MLCK in mice prevents mislocalization of junctional proteins and L. monocytogenes translocation. Thus, L. monocytogenes uses LAP to exploit epithelial defenses and cross the intestinal epithelial barrier.

Abstract: Summary
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generate hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) but fail to engraft xenograft models used to detect adult/somatic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from donors. Recent progress to derive hPSC-derived HSCs has relied on cell-autonomous forced expression of transcription factors; however, the relationship of bone marrow to transplanted cells remains unknown. Here, we quantified a failure of hPSC-HPCs to survive even 24 hr post transplantation. Across several hPSC-HPC differentiation methodologies, we identified the lack of CXCR4 expression and function. Ectopic CXCR4 conferred CXCL12 ligand-dependent signaling of hPSC-HPCs in biochemical assays and increased migration/chemotaxis, hematopoietic progenitor capacity, and survival and proliferation following in vivo transplantation. This was accompanied by a transcriptional shift of hPSC-HPCs toward somatic/adult sources, but this approach failed to produce long-term HSC xenograft reconstitution. Our results reveal that networks involving CXCR4 should be targeted to generate putative HSCs with in vivo function from hPSCs.

Abstract: The taxanes Docetaxel and Paclitaxel are two of the standard chemotherapies for patients with metastatic breast cancer. The functional effect of Docetaxel and Paclitaxel on human innate immune cells of the myeloid lineage is not well established, nor is the effects these agents have on differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and dendritic cells. Therefore, the aim with this project was to determine the effects of Docetaxel and Paclitaxel on primary human monocyte differentiation, activation and function. For this purpose, primary human monocytes were isolated from healthy donors and cultured with or without Docetaxel and Paclitaxel. We found that Docetaxel promoted the differentiation of primary human monocytes into pro-inflammatory macrophages with an M1 phenotype and an ability to present antigens to T cells. Monocytes treated with Docetaxel also displayed an elevated secretion of IL-8 and IL-1β, but did not promote generation of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In conclusion, Docetaxel appears to have an immune stimulatory effect that would be beneficial for an anti-tumorigenic type of immune response, whereas Paclitaxel seems to have less effect on myeloid cells.

Abstract: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common B cell malignancy with approximately 30% of patients present relapsed or refractory disease after first-line therapy. Research of further treatment options is needed. Cytotoxic CD4+ T cells express cytolytic molecules and have potential antitumor function. Here, we showed that the CD19+ cells from DLBCL patients presented significantly reduced expression of MHC II molecules than those from healthy controls. Three years after the first-line treatment, patients that presented relapsed disease had significantly lower MHC II expression on their CD19+ cells than patients who did not show recurrence. Examining cytotoxic CD4+ T cells show that DLBCL patients presented significantly elevated frequencies of granzyme A-, granzyme B-, and/or perforin-expressing cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. Also, frequency of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in DLBCL patients was positively correlated with the MHC II expression level. Subsequently, the cytotoxic potential of CD4+ T cells against autologous CD19+ cells was investigated. We found that the cytotoxic potential of CD4+ T cells was highest in MHC II-high, intermediate in MHC II-mid, and lowest in MHC II-low patients. The percentage of MHC II-expressing viable CD19+ cells presented a significant reduction after longer incubation with cytotoxic CD4+ T cells, suggesting that cytotoxic CD4+ T cells preferentially eliminated MHC II-expressing CD19+ cells. Blocking MHC II on CD19+ cells significantly reduced the cytolytic capacity of CD4+ T cells. Despite these discoveries, the frequency of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells did not predict the clinical outcome of DLBCL patients. Together, these results demonstrated that cytotoxic CD4+ T cells presented an MHC II-dependent cytotoxic potential against autologous CD19+ cells and could potentially represent a future treatment option for DLBCL.

Abstract: γδT cells are a distinct T-cell subset that display unique characteristics regarding T-cell receptor gene usage, tissue tropism and antigen recognition. Adoptive γδT cell transfer therapy has recently been gaining importance as an efficient approach in cancer immunotherapy. However, exploiting γδT cell response for tumour immunotherapy is a challenge due to cell numbers, activities and differentiation states that minimize the clinical therapeutic effects. Previous studies have indicated that the wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway plays a crucial role in the differentiation, survival and enhancement of the immune response of T lymphocytes. In this study, we sought to evaluate whether the activation of the wnt/β-catenin pathway through inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) using 4,6-disubstituted pyrrolopyrimidine (TWS119) could be an efficient strategy to improve the proliferation, differentiation and cytolytic activity of γδT cells against colon cancer cells. Remarkably, we found that TWS119 significantly enhanced the proliferation and survival of γδT cells via activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, upregulation of the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and inhibition of cleaved caspase-3 in addition to the Wnt pathway. Our results also showed that enhancement of the cytolytic activity of γδT cells against human colon cancer cells by TWS119 was chiefly associated with upregulation of the expression of perforin and granzyme B in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, TWS119 can induce the expression of CD62L or CCR5 to generate a population of CD62L+γδT or CCR5+γδT cells in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggested that TWS119 could be a useful complementary agent for improving γδT cell-based immunotherapy.

Abstract: Background
Recent reports have demonstrated that RAF-1L613V (a mutant of RAF-1) mutant mice show bone deformities similar to Noonan syndrome. It has been suggested that RAF-1L613V might abnormally activate osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells.
Methods
To demonstrate that RAF-1 is associated with bone deformity and that RAF-1L613V dependent bone deformity could be inhibited by microRNA-195 (miR-195), we first investigated the amplifying influence of wild-type RAF-1 (WT) or RAF-1L613V (L613V) on the viability and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells induced by bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin Red S (ARS) staining, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis. Subsequently, we investigated the blocking effect and its mechanism of miR-195 for abnormal activation of osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells via targeting RAF-1.
Results
RAF-1, especially RAF-1L613V, abnormally activates osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells induced by BMP-2. Meanwhile, miR-195 could inhibit the cell viability and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Transfection of miR-195 largely suppressed the L613V-induced viability and osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and attenuated the accelerative effect of L613V on runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2), Osterix (OSX), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN), and distal-less homeobox 5 (DLX5) osteogenic gene expressions. In addition, miR-195 decreased the expression of RAF-1 mRNA and protein by directly targeting the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of RAF-1 mRNA in MC3T3-E1 cells.
Conclusions
Our findings indicated that miR-195 inhibited WT and L613V RAF-1 induced hyperactive osteoblast differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells by targeting RAF-1. miR-195 might be a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of L613V-induced bone deformity in Noonan syndrome.

Abstract: Several studies have indicated the involvement of DLX1 in the progression of prostate cancer. However, the functions of DLX1 in the prostate cancer and the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we have shown that DLX1 was up-regulated in the prostate clinical samples. DLX1 promoted the growth, migration and colony formation of prostate cancer cells by activating beta-catenin/TCF signaling. DLX1 interacted with beta-catenin and enhanced the interaction between beta-catenin and TCF4. Taken together, this study demonstrated that DLX1 exerted the oncogenic roles on the prostate cancer by activating beta-catenin/TCF signaling.

Precise control of gene expression during development is orchestrated by transcription factors and co-regulators including chromatin modifiers. How particular chromatin-modifying enzymes affect specific developmental processes is not well defined. Here, we report that GCN5, a histone acetyltransferase essential for embryonic development, is required for proper expression of multiple genes encoding components of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling pathway in early embryoid bodies (EBs). Gcn5−/− EBs display deficient activation of ERK and p38, mislocalization of cytoskeletal components, and compromised capacity to differentiate toward mesodermal lineage. Genomic analyses identified seven genes as putative direct targets of GCN5 during early differentiation, four of which are cMYC targets. These findings established a link between GCN5 and the FGF signaling pathway and highlighted specific GCN5-MYC partnerships in gene regulation during early differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Diet strongly affects gut microbiota composition, and gut bacteria can influence the colonic mucus layer, a physical barrier that separates trillions of gut bacteria from the host. However, the interplay between a Western style diet (WSD), gut microbiota composition, and the intestinal mucus layer is less clear. Here we show that mice fed a WSD have an altered colonic microbiota composition that causes increased penetrability and a reduced growth rate of the inner mucus layer. Both barrier defects can be prevented by transplanting microbiota from chow-fed mice. In addition, we found that administration of Bifidobacterium longum was sufficient to restore mucus growth, whereas administration of the fiber inulin prevented increased mucus penetrability in WSD-fed mice. We hypothesize that the presence of distinct bacteria is crucial for proper mucus function. If confirmed in humans, these findings may help to better understand diseases with an affected mucus layer, such as ulcerative colitis.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent stem cells can be differentiated into 3D retinal organoids, with major cell types self-patterning into a polarized, laminated architecture. In static cultures, organoid development may be hindered by limitations in diffusion of oxygen and nutrients. Herein, we report a bioprocess using rotating-wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors to culture retinal organoids derived from mouse pluripotent stem cells. Organoids in RWV demonstrate enhanced proliferation, with well-defined morphology and improved differentiation of neurons including ganglion cells and S-cone photoreceptors. Furthermore, RWV organoids at day 25 (D25) reveal similar maturation and transcriptome profile as those at D32 in static culture, closely recapitulating spatiotemporal development of postnatal day 6 mouse retina in vivo. Interestingly, however, retinal organoids do not differentiate further under any in vitro condition tested here, suggesting additional requirements for functional maturation. Our studies demonstrate that bioreactors can accelerate and improve organoid growth and differentiation for modeling retinal disease and evaluation of therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Human vision relies heavily upon cone photoreceptors, and their loss results in permanent visual impairment. Transplantation of healthy photoreceptors can restore visual function in models of inherited blindness, a process previously understood to arise by donor cell integration within the host retina. However, we and others recently demonstrated that donor rod photoreceptors engage in material transfer with host photoreceptors, leading to the host cells acquiring proteins otherwise expressed only by donor cells. We sought to determine whether stem cell- and donor-derived cones undergo integration and/or material transfer. We find that material transfer accounts for a significant proportion of rescued cells following cone transplantation into non-degenerative hosts. Strikingly, however, substantial numbers of cones integrated into the Nrl−/− and Prph2rd2/rd2, but not Nrl−/−;RPE65R91W/R91W, murine models of retinal degeneration. This confirms the occurrence of photoreceptor integration in certain models of retinal degeneration and demonstrates the importance of the host environment in determining transplantation outcome.

Abstract: Summary
The basis for selective vulnerability of certain cell types for misfolded proteins (MPs) in neurodegenerative diseases is largely unknown. This knowledge is crucial for understanding disease progression in relation to MPs spreading in the CNS. We assessed this issue in Drosophila by cell-specific expression of human Aβ1-42 associated with Alzheimer's disease. Expression of Aβ1-42 in various neurons resulted in concentration-dependent severe neurodegenerative phenotypes, and intraneuronal ring-tangle-like aggregates with immature fibril properties when analyzed by aggregate-specific ligands. Unexpectedly, expression of Aβ1-42 from a pan-glial driver produced a mild phenotype despite massive brain load of Aβ1-42 aggregates, even higher than in the strongest neuronal driver. Glial cells formed more mature fibrous aggregates, morphologically distinct from aggregates found in neurons, and was mainly extracellular. Our findings implicate that Aβ1-42 cytotoxicity is both cell and aggregate morphotype dependent.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that produce most of the cellular ATP, and are involved in many other cellular functions such as Ca2+ signaling, differentiation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell growth. One key process of mitochondrial dynamics is mitochondrial fusion, which is catalyzed by mitofusins (MFN1 and MFN2) and OPA1. The outer mitochondrial membrane protein MFN2 plays a relevant role in the maintenance of mitochondrial metabolism, insulin signaling, and mutations that cause neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, modulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics has emerged as a potential pharmacological strategy. Here, we report the identification of small molecules by high-throughput screen that promote mitochondrial elongation in an MFN1/MFN2-dependent manner. Detailed analysis of their mode of action reveals a previously unknown connection between pyrimidine metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics. Our data indicate a link between pyrimidine biosynthesis and mitochondrial dynamics, which maintains cell survival under stress conditions characterized by loss of pyrimidine synthesis.

Abstract: Atrial fibrosis plays a critical role in atrial fibrillation (AF) by the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad pathway. The disordered differentiation, proliferation, migration and collagen deposition of atrial fibroblasts play significant roles in atrial fibrosis. Mitsugumin (MG)53 is predominantly expressed in myocardium of rodents and has multiple biological functions. However, the role of MG53 in cardiac fibrosis remains unclear. This study provided clinical and experimental evidence for the involvement of MG53 in atrial fibrosis in humans and atrial fibrosis phenotype in cultured rat atrial fibroblasts. In atrial tissue from patients we demonstrated that MG53 was expressed in human atrium. Expression of MG53 increased with the extent of atrial fibrosis, which could induce AF. In cultured atrial fibroblasts, depletion of MG53 by siRNA caused down-regulation of the TGF-β1/Smad pathway, while overexpression of MG53 by adenovirus up-regulated the pathway. MG53 regulated the proliferation and migration of atrial fibroblasts. Besides, exogenous TGF-β1 suppressed expression of MG53. In conclusion, we demonstrated that MG53 was expressed in human atrium, and may be a potential upstream of the TGF-β1/Smad pathway in human atrium and rat atrial fibroblasts. This suggests that MG53 is a potential regulator of atrial fibrosis induced by the TGF-β1/Smad pathway in patients with AF.

Abstract: ChPur-α, a purine-rich element-binding protein, was discovered showing affinity to the ChHsc70 promoter in Crassostrea hongkongensis by DNA affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis. Direct interaction between purified ChPur-α and the ChHsc70 promoter region was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay in vitro. ChPur-α reduction led to clear enhancements of ChHsc70 transcription in the hemocytes of C. hongkongensis. Consistently, ChPur-α overexpression in heterologous HEK293T cells correlated with repressive phenotype in ChHsc70 promoter expression. ChHsc70 transcription was responsive to heat shock or CdCl2 stress by RT-PCR, signifying an inducible feature of ChHsc70 transcription by physical/chemical stress despite its constitutive nature. ChPur-α transcription was also induced by the two stressors. This indicates a plausible association between ChHsc70 and ChPur-α in the stress-induced genetic regulatory pathway. This study discovered a negatively regulatory role of ChPur-α in controlling ChHsc70 transcription in C. hongkongensis, and contributed to better understanding the regulatory mechanisms in control of Hsc70 transcription.

Abstract: Several species of Streptococcus, such as S. salivarius, S. mitis, and S. anginosus, are found to extensively colonize the oral cavity and the upper respiratory tract, and have been shown to increase in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Accumulating evidence have revealed that commensal bacteria are involved in antitumor immunity via T cell-mediated mechanisms, but the role of Streptococcus enrichment in OSCC is yet unclear. In this study, we stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from non-cancer controls (NCs) and OSCC patients with S. salivarius, S. mitis, and S. anginosus. We observed that compared to NC subjects, OSCC patients at earlier stages had higher frequencies of granzyme B-expressing CD8 T cells for all Streptococcus species tested, while OSCC patients at more advanced stages had higher frequencies of granzyme B-expressing CD8 T cells for S. anginosus but not other Streptococcus species. In OSCC patients, the Streptococcus-reactive CD8 T cells presented significantly lower levels of PD-1 and TIM-3 expression than Streptococcus-nonreactive CD8 T cells. The clinical outcomes of OSCC patients in our cohort were tracked for 24 months after the resection of the primary tumor. In patients that did not present tumor recurrence, the frequencies of S. salivarius-reactive and S. mitis-reactive CD8 T cells were significantly higher than that in patients that developed recurrent tumor. Furthermore, in patients with tumor recurrence, the duration between primary tumor resection and tumor recurrence was positively associated with the frequencies of S. salivarius-reactive and S. anginosus-reactive CD8 T cells. Together, we demonstrated that Streptococcus-reactive CD8 T cell responses might contribute to antitumor immunity in OSCC patients.

Abstract: Human stromal stem cells (hMSCs) differentiate into adipocytes that play a role in skeletal tissue homeostasis and whole body energy metabolism. During adipocyte differentiation, hMSCs exhibit significant changes in cell morphology suggesting changes in cytoskeletal organization. Here, we examined the effect of direct modulation of actin microfilament dynamics on adipocyte differentiation. Stabilizing actin filaments in hMSCs by siRNA-mediated knock down of the two main actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs): Cofilin 1 (CFL1) and Destrin (DSTN) or treating the cells by Phalloidin reduced adipocyte differentiation as evidenced by decreased number of mature adipocytes and decreased adipocyte specific gene expression (ADIPOQ, LPL, PPARG, FABP4). In contrast, disruption of actin cytoskeleton by Cytochalasin D enhanced adipocyte differentiation. Follow up studies revealed that the effects of CFL1 on adipocyte differentiation depended on the activity of LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) which is the major upstream kinase of CFL1. Inhibiting LIMK by its specific chemical inhibitor LIMKi inhibited the phosphorylation of CFL1 and actin polymerization, and enhanced the adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, treating hMSCs by Cytochalasin D inhibited ERK and Smad2 signaling and this was associated with enhanced adipocyte differentiation. On the other hand, Phalloidin enhanced ERK and Smad2 signaling, but inhibited adipocyte differentiation which was rescued by ERK specific chemical inhibitor U0126. Our data provide a link between restructuring of hMSCs cytoskeleton and hMSCs lineage commitment and differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The first hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are generated during development from hemogenic endothelium (HE) through trans-differentiation. The molecular mechanisms underlying this endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the role of the epigenetic regulators HDAC1 and HDAC2 in the emergence of these first blood cells in vitro and in vivo. Loss of either of these epigenetic silencers through conditional genetic deletion reduced hematopoietic transition from HE, while combined deletion was incompatible with blood generation. We investigated the molecular basis of HDAC1 and HDAC2 requirement and identified TGF-β signaling as one of the pathways controlled by HDAC1 and HDAC2. Accordingly, we experimentally demonstrated that activation of this pathway in HE cells reinforces hematopoietic development. Altogether, our results establish that HDAC1 and HDAC2 modulate TGF-β signaling and suggest that stimulation of this pathway in HE cells would be beneficial for production of hematopoietic cells for regenerative therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Mammary stem and progenitor cells are essential for mammary gland homeostasis and are also candidates for cells of origin of mammary tumors. Here, we have investigated the function of the protein kinase p38α in the mammary gland using mice that delete this protein in the luminal epithelial cells. We show that p38α regulates the fate of luminal progenitor cells through modulation of the transcription factor RUNX1, an important controller of the estrogen receptor-positive cell lineage. We also provide evidence that the regulation of RUNX1 by p38α probably involves the kinase MSK1, which phosphorylates histone H3 at the RUNX1 promoter. Moreover, using a mouse model for breast cancer initiated by luminal cells, we show that p38α downregulation in mammary epithelial cells reduces tumor burden, which correlates with decreased numbers of tumor-initiating cells. Collectively, our results define a key role for p38α in luminal progenitor cell fate that affects mammary tumor formation.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide with elusive molecular mechanisms. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical significance and biological roles of breast cancer-associated protein 3 (BCA3) in HCC. Our investigation demonstrated that BCA3 expression was up-regulated in primary HCC tissues, and BCA3 levels were positively correlated with tumor size, TNM stage, microvascular invasion and poor prognosis. BCA3 promoted tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis of HCC in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that BCA3 induced aggressive behaviors were mediated by AKT activation, which in turn activated mTOR signalling pathway and induced cytoplasm-nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Blockage of AKT signalling pathway by a specific AKT inhibitor LY294002 impaired BCA3 mediated phenotypes. Collectively, our current study indicated the pleiotropic effects of BCA3 in HCC progression, and blockage of BCA3-AKT pathway might contribute to development of therapeutic measures for HCC.

Novel proteins that regulate cell extension formation in fibroblasts,

Abstract: Cell extensions are critical structures that enable matrix remodeling in wound healing and cancer invasion but the regulation of their formation is not well-defined. We searched for new proteins that mediated cell extension formation over collagen by tandem mass tagged mass spectrometry analysis of purified extensions in 3T3 fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, importin-5, ENH isoform 1b (PDLIM5) and 26 S protease regulatory subunit 6B (PSMC4) were more abundant (> 10-fold) in membrane-penetrating cell extensions than cell bodies, which was confirmed by immunostaining and immunoblotting and also observed in human gingival fibroblasts. After siRNA knockdown of these proteins and plating cells on grid-supported floating collagen gels for 6 h, formation of cell extensions and collagen remodeling were examined. Knockdown of importin-5 reduced collagen compaction (1.9-fold), pericellular collagen degradation (~ 1.8-fold) and number of cell extensions (~ 69%). Knockdown of PSMC4 reduced collagen compaction (~ 1.5-fold), pericellular collagen degradation (~ 1.7-fold) and number of cell extensions (~ 42%). Knockdown of PDLIM5 reduced collagen compaction (~ 1.6-fold) and number of cell extensions (~ 21%). Inhibition of the TGF-β RI kinase, Smad3 or ROCK-II signaling pathways reduced the abundance of PDLIM5 in cell extensions but PSMC4 and importin-5 were reduced only by Smad3 or ROCK-II inhibitors. We conclude that these novel proteins are required for cell extension formation and their recruitment into extensions involves the Smad3 and ROCK signaling pathways.

Abstract: Human antigen R (HuR) is a RNA-binding protein, which binds to the AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of certain mRNA and is involved in the export and stabilization of ARE-mRNA. HuR constitutively relocates to the cytoplasm in many cancer cells, however the mechanism of intracellular HuR trafficking is poorly understood. To address this question, we examined the functional role of the cytoskeleton in HuR relocalization. We tested the effect of actin depolymerizing macrolide latrunculin A or myosin II ATPase activity inhibitor blebbistatin for HuR relocalization induced by the vasoactive hormone Angiotensin II in cancer and control normal cells. Western blot and confocal imaging data revealed that both inhibitors attenuated the cytoplasmic HuR in normal cells but no such alteration was observed in cancer cells. Concomitant with changes in intracellular HuR localization, both inhibitors markedly decreased the accumulation and half-lives of HuR target ARE-mRNAs in normal cells, whereas no change was observed in cancer cells. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments with HuR proteins revealed clear physical interaction with ß-actin only in normal cells. The current study is the first to verify that cancer cells can implicate a microfilament independent HuR transport. We hypothesized that when cytoskeleton structure is impaired, cancer cells can acquire an alternative HuR trafficking strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Satellite cells function as precursor cells in mature skeletal muscle homeostasis and regeneration. In healthy tissue, these cells are maintained in a state of quiescence by a microenvironment formed by myofibers and basement membrane in which LAMININs (LMs) form a major component. In the present study, we evaluated the satellite cell microenvironment in vivo and found that these cells are encapsulated by LMα2–5. We sought to recapitulate this satellite cell niche in vitro by culturing satellite cells in the presence of recombinant LM-E8 fragments. We show that treatment with LM-E8 promotes proliferation of satellite cells in an undifferentiated state, through reduced phosphorylation of JNK and p38. On transplantation into injured muscle tissue, satellite cells cultured with LM-E8 promoted the regeneration of skeletal muscle. These findings represent an efficient method of culturing satellite cells for use in transplantation through the recapitulation of the satellite cell niche using recombinant LM-E8 fragments.

Abstract: Summary
Activating KRAS mutations are major oncogenic drivers in multiple tumor types. Synthetic lethal screens have previously been used to identify targets critical for the survival of KRAS mutant cells, but their application to drug discovery has proven challenging, possibly due in part to a failure of monolayer cultures to model tumor biology. Here, we report the results of a high-throughput synthetic lethal screen for small molecules that selectively inhibit the growth of KRAS mutant cell lines in soft agar. Chemoproteomic profiling identifies the target of the most KRAS-selective chemical series as dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). DHODH inhibition is shown to perturb multiple metabolic pathways. In vivo preclinical studies demonstrate strong antitumor activity upon DHODH inhibition in a pancreatic tumor xenograft model.

Abstract: Summary
We have developed an improved episomal vector system for efficient generation of integration-free induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. More recently, we reported that the use of an optimized CRISPR-Cas9 system together with a double-cut donor increases homology-directed repair-mediated precise gene knockin efficiency by 5- to 10-fold. Here, we report the integration of blood cell reprogramming and genome editing in a single step. We found that expression of Cas9 and KLF4 using a single vector significantly increases genome editing efficiency, and addition of SV40LT further enhances knockin efficiency. After these optimizations, genome editing efficiency of up to 40% in the bulk iPSC population can be achieved without any selection. Most of the edited cells show characteristics of iPSCs and genome integrity. Our improved approach, which integrates reprogramming and genome editing, should expedite both basic research and clinical applications of precision and regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Summary
Since their first identification 50 years ago, marburgviruses have emerged several times, with 83%–90% lethality in the largest outbreaks. Although no vaccines or therapeutics are available for human use, the human antibody MR191 provides complete protection in non-human primates when delivered several days after inoculation of a lethal marburgvirus dose. The detailed neutralization mechanism of MR191 remains outstanding. Here we present a 3.2 Å crystal structure of MR191 complexed with a trimeric marburgvirus surface glycoprotein (GP). MR191 neutralizes by occupying the conserved receptor-binding site and competing with the host receptor Niemann-Pick C1. The structure illuminates previously disordered regions of GP including the stalk, fusion loop, CX6CC switch, and an N-terminal region of GP2 that wraps about the outside of GP1 to anchor a marburgvirus-specific “wing” antibody epitope. Virus escape mutations mapped far outside the MR191 receptor-binding site footprint suggest a role for these other regions in the GP quaternary structure.

Abstract: Adult bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have cross-functional, intrinsic potency that is of therapeutic interest. Their ability to regenerate bone, fat, and cartilage, modulate the immune system, and nurture the growth and function of other bone marrow hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells have all been evaluated by transplant applications of MSCs. These applications require the isolation and expansion scaled cell production. To investigate biophysical properties of MSCs that can be feasibly utilized as predictors of bioactivity during biomanufacturing, we used a low-density seeding model to drive MSCs into proliferative stress and exhibit the hallmark characteristics of in vitro aging. A low-density seeding method was used to generate MSCs from passages 1–7 to simulate serial expansion of these cells to maximize yield from a single donor. MSCs were subjected to three bioactivity assays in parallel to ascertain whether patterns in MSC age, size, and shape were associated with the outcomes of the potency assays. MSC age was found to be a predictor of adipogenesis, while cell and nuclear shape was strongly associated to hematopoietic-supportive potency. Together, these data evaluate morphological changes associated with cell potency and highlight new strategies for purification or alternatives to assessing MSC quality.

Abstract: RUNX2 is a key regulator of osteogenic differentiation and odontoblastic differentiation. RUNX2 mutations could cause Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD; OMIM119600), which is featured by abnormal development of bone and teeth. By using microRNA array, we identified a large number of microRNAs that showed different expression between wild-type Runx2 group and mutant groups. The aim of this study is to find out the effect of mmu-miR-1963, which was downregulated in all mutant Runx2 groups, on the ameloblast differentiation of LS8 cells. qPCR and Western Blot results showed the suppressive effect of mmu-miR-1963 on ameloblast differentiation of LS8 cell line. We further confirmed Smoc2 as one direct target of mmu-miR-1963. For the first time, we showed that mmu-miR-1963 could regulate the ameloblast differentiation of LS8 by targeting Smoc2. This study suggests the suppressive role of mmu-miR-1963 on ameloblast differentiation of LS8 via directly targeting the 3’UTR of Smoc2. We also demonstrated that Smoc2 itself could promote the ameloblast differentiation of LS8 for the first time. Our results indicate a novel explanation to the enamel hypoplasia phenotype in part of CCD patients.

Abstract: This study was done in order to determine the molecular and biochemical alterations following testicular torsion (TT) and torsion-reperfusion (TR). For this purpose, 54 male Wistar rats were divided into five groups as control group (n = 6) and experimental group subjected to 1, 2, 4, and 8 h unilateral left torsion induction (n = 12 in each group). After induction of TT, testicular samples were collected from each group (n = 6), and the other six rats of each group underwent the same period of reperfusion after TT and then were sampled. Histological changes, the mRNA and protein expression of heat shock protein-70 (Hsp70), and caspase-3 were examined using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Testicular total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were evaluated. The mRNA damage and DNA fragmentation were assessed. The TT and TR significantly reduced differentiation and spermiogenesis indices (p < 0.05). The TT- and TR-induced groups exhibited a severe reduction in Hsp70 expression as well as remarkable enhancement in caspase-3 expression. The TAC and GSH-px levels were decreased and the MDA content was increased in TT- and TR-induced groups. Finally, the TT and TR enhanced mRNA damage and DNA fragmentation. The TT- and TR-induced damaging oxidative stress, diminished Hsp70 expression, and enhanced caspase-3 mRNA and protein levels result in apoptosis following 1, 2, and 4 h. Whereas, following 8 h, TT and TR initiate the necrosis by inducing energy depletion as well as severe mRNA damage.

Abstract: Podoplanin is upregulated in the invasive front of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may mediate podoplanin expression. However, the role of podoplanin in OSCC cell and fibroblast interaction remains elusive. In the present study, we found that positive podoplanin expression in OSCC cells correlated with smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression in CAFs. Using CAFs and normal mucosal fibroblasts (NFs), we established indirect and direct co-culture systems mimicking the structure of OSCC. Podoplanin-overexpressing OSCC cells promoted NF activation; in direct co-culture, but not in indirect co-culture, podoplanin-overexpressing OSCC cells increased fibroblast invasion via matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-14, and αv/β6 integrin receptor (ITGA5/ITGB6) signaling. CAFs also induced podoplanin expression through the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smad pathway. TGF-β1 increased the podoplanin-dependent activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), AKT, and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Additionally, CAFs promoted OSCC cell invasion by upregulating MMP-2 and MMP-14 expression in both indirect and direct co-culture. Taken together, our findings indicate that podoplanin regulates the interaction between OSCC cells and CAFs via the mutual paracrine effects of TGF-β1.

O-GlcNAcylation affects β-catenin and E-cadherin expression, cell motility and tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer,

Abstract: O-GlcNAcylation, the addition of β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) moiety to Ser/Thr residues, is a sensor of the cell metabolic state. Cancer diseases such as colon, lung and breast cancer, possess deregulated O-GlcNAcylation. Studies during the last decade revealed that O-GlcNAcylation is implicated in cancer tumorigenesis and proliferation. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and cadherin-mediated adhesion are also implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key cellular process in invasion and cancer metastasis. Often, deregulation of the Wnt pathway is caused by altered phosphorylation of its components. Specifically, phosphorylation of Ser or Thr residues of β-catenin affects its location and interaction with E-cadherin, thus facilitating cell-cell adhesion. Consistent with previous studies, the current study indicates that β-catenin is O-GlcNAcylated. To test the effect of O-GlcNAcylation on cell motility and how O-GlcNAcylation might affect β-catenin and E-cadherin functions, the enzyme machinery of O-GlcNAcylation was modulated either with chemical inhibitors or by gene silencing. When O-GlcNAcase (OGA) was inhibited, a global elevation of protein O-GlcNAcylation and increase in the expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin were noted. Concomitantly with enhanced O-GlcNAcylation, β-catenin transcriptional activity were elevated. Additionally, fibroblast cell motility was enhanced. Stable silenced cell lines with adenoviral OGA or adenoviral O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) were established. Consistent with the results obtained by OGA chemical inhibition by TMG, OGT-silencing led to a significant reduction in β-catenin level. In vivo, murine orthotropic colorectal cancer model indicates that elevated O-GlcNAcylation leads to increased mortality rate, tumor and metastasis development. However, reduction in O-GlcNAcylation promoted survival that could be attributed to attenuated tumor and metastasis development. The results described herein provide circumstantial clues that O-GlcNAcylation deregulates β-catenin and E-cadherin expression and activity in fibroblast cell lines and this might influence EMT and cell motility, which may further influence tumor development and metastasis.

Pediatric glioblastoma cells inhibit neurogenesis and promote astrogenesis, phenotypic transformation and migration of human neural progenitor cells within cocultures,

Abstract: Neural progenitor cell (NPC) fate is influenced by a variety of biological cues elicited from the surrounding microenvironment and recent studies suggest their possible role in pediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) development. Since a few GBM cells also display NPC characteristics, it is not clear whether NPCs transform to tumor cell phenotype leading to the onset of GBM formation, or NPCs migrate to developing tumor sites in response to paracrine signaling from GBM cells. Elucidating the paracrine interactions between GBM cells and NPCs in vivo is challenging due to the inherent complexity of the CNS. Here, we investigated the interactions between human NPCs (ReNcell) and human pediatric GBM-derived cells (SJ-GBM2) using a Transwell® coculture setup to assess the effects of GBM cells on ReNcells (cytokine and chemokine release, viability, phenotype, differentiation, migration). Standalone ReNcell or GBM cultures served as controls. Qualitative and quantitative results from ELISA®, Live/Dead® and BrdU assays, immunofluorescence labeling, western blot analysis, and scratch test suggests that although ReNcell viability remained unaffected in the presence of pediatric GBM cells, their morphology, phenotype, differentiation patterns, neurite outgrowth, migration patterns (average speed, distance, number of cells) and GSK-3β expression were significantly influenced. The cumulative distance migrated by the cells in each condition was fit to Furth's formula, derived formally from Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. ReNcell differentiation into neural lineage was compromised and astrogenesis promoted within cocultures. Such coculture platform could be extended to identify the specific molecules contributing to the observed phenomena, to investigate whether NPCs could be transplanted to replace lesions of excised tumor sites, and to elucidate the underlying molecular pathways involved in GBM-NPC interactions within the tumor microenvironment.

K-ras mutation promotes ionizing radiation-induced invasion and migration of lung cancer in part via the Cathepsin L/CUX1 pathway,

Abstract: K-ras mutation is involved in cancer progression including invasion and migration, but the underlying mechanism is not yet clear. Cathepsin L is a lysosomal cysteine protease and has recently been associated with invasion and migration in human cancers when it is overexpressed. Our recent studies have shown that ionizing radiation (IR) enhanced expression of cathepsin L and increased invasion and migration of tumor cells, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. In the present study, the effects of K-ras mutation and IR induced invasion and migration of lung cancer as well as the underlying mechanisms were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Firstly, the levels of cathepsin L and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker proteins remarkably changed in A549 (K-ras mutant) after irradiation compared with H1299 (K-ras wild), thereby promoting invasion and migration. Additionally, cathepsin L and its downstream transcription factor CUX1/p110 were increased after irradiation in A549 transfected with CUX1/p200, and the proteolytic processing of CUX1 by cathepsin L was remarkably increased after co-transfection of CUX1/p200 and cathepsin L-lentivirus in H1299. In addition, delivery of a mutant K-ras (V12) into HEK 293 cells stimulated EMT after irradiation due to the accumulation of cathepsin L. Moreover, mutated K-ras was associated with IR-induced cathepsin L and EMT in BALB/c nude mice. Finally, the level of cathepsin L expression was higher in samples carrying a K-ras mutation than in wild-type K-ras samples and the mesenchymal markers were upregulated in the samples of mutant K-ras, whereas the epithelial marker E-cadherin was downregulated in non-small cell lung cancers tissues. In conclusion, the findings demonstrated that mutated K-ras promotes cathepsin L expression and plays a pivotal role in EMT of human lung cancer. The regulatory effect of IR-induced cathepsin L on lung cancer invasion and migration was partially attributed to the Cathepsin L /CUX1-mediated EMT signaling pathway. This study will provide cathepsin L as a potential target for tumor therapy.

Abstract: Multiple coagulation factor deficiency protein 2 (MCFD2), a binding partner of lectin mannose binding 1 (LMAN1), causes combined deficiencies of coagulation factors V and VIII. MCFD2 function in inherited hematologic disorders is well elucidated; however, little is known about its role in human tumorigenesis. The aim of the current study was to investigate the states of MCFD2 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The expression of MCFD2 was up-regulated significantly in all cell lines examined. Evaluation of the cellular functions associated with tumoral metastasis showed that MCFD2 knockdown (shMCFD2) cells exhibited significantly lower cellular invasiveness and migration and higher cellular adhesion compared with shControl cells. Of note, shMCFD2 cells also showed weak immunoreactivity of LMAN1 and a lower secretion level of galactoside-binding soluble 3 binding protein (LGALS3BP). In addition to in vitro validation, clinical data on 70 patients with OSCC indicated that state of MCFD2 expression level is associated with regional lymph node metastasis. Altogether, we have demonstrated that MCFD2 promotes cancer metastasis by regulating LMAN1 and LGALS3BP expression levels. Hence, MCFD2 may represent a promising candidate for a novel therapeutic target for patients with metastatic OSCCs.

Abstract: Summary
Skeletal muscle harbors quiescent stem cells termed satellite cells and proliferative progenitors termed myoblasts, which play pivotal roles during muscle regeneration. However, current technology does not allow permanent capture of these cell populations in vitro. Here, we show that ectopic expression of the myogenic transcription factor MyoD, combined with exposure to small molecules, reprograms mouse fibroblasts into expandable induced myogenic progenitor cells (iMPCs). iMPCs express key skeletal muscle stem and progenitor cell markers including Pax7 and Myf5 and give rise to dystrophin-expressing myofibers upon transplantation in vivo. Notably, a subset of transplanted iMPCs maintain Pax7 expression and sustain serial regenerative responses. Similar to satellite cells, iMPCs originate from Pax7+ cells and require Pax7 itself for maintenance. Finally, we show that myogenic progenitor cell lines can be established from muscle tissue following small-molecule exposure alone. This study thus reports on a robust approach to derive expandable myogenic stem/progenitor-like cells from multiple cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Following the recent emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV), many murine and human neutralizing anti-ZIKV antibodies have been reported. Given the risk of virus escape mutants, engineering antibodies that target mutationally constrained epitopes with therapeutically relevant potencies can be valuable for combating future outbreaks. Here, we applied computational methods to engineer an antibody, ZAb_FLEP, that targets a highly networked and therefore mutationally constrained surface formed by the envelope protein dimer. ZAb_FLEP neutralized a breadth of ZIKV strains and protected mice in distinct in vivo models, including resolving vertical transmission and fetal mortality in infected pregnant mice. Serial passaging of ZIKV in the presence of ZAb_FLEP failed to generate viral escape mutants, suggesting that its epitope is indeed mutationally constrained. A single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction of the Fab-ZIKV complex validated the structural model and revealed insights into ZAb_FLEP's neutralization mechanism. ZAb_FLEP has potential as a therapeutic in future outbreaks.

Abstract: Summary
Cholesterol is an essential component of most biological membranes and serves important functions in controlling membrane integrity, organization, and signaling. However, probes to follow the dynamic distribution of cholesterol in live cells are scarce and so far show only limited applicability. Herein, we addressed this problem by synthesizing and characterizing a class of versatile and clickable cholesterol-based imidazolium salts. We show that these cholesterol analogs faithfully mimic the biophysical properties of natural cholesterol in phospholipid mono- and bilayers, and that they integrate into the plasma membrane of cultured and primary human cells. The membrane-incorporated cholesterol analogs can be specifically labeled by click chemistry and visualized in live-cell imaging experiments that show a distribution and behavior comparable with that of endogenous membrane cholesterol. These results indicate that the cholesterol analogs can be used to reveal the dynamic distribution of cholesterol in live cells.

Abstract: The activation of Notch3 is associated with potential progression of ovarian cancer, tumor invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance, which account for poor prognosis of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). However, the underlying mechanisms of Notch3 are not yet very clear. Here we show that SUSD2 is one of Notch3-regulating genes and the elevated protein expression of SUSD2 in HGSOC. We also found that its high expression level was significantly correlated with worse overall survival, early recurrence and lymph nodes metastasis. Moreover, overexpression of SUSD2 in ovarian cancer cells promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the metastatic capacity of malignant cells. In contrast, silencing SUSD2 in aggressive ovarian cancer cells inhibited these processes both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found SUSD2 promoted EMT through regulating the expression of EpCAM and EpCAM silencing reversed SUSD2-induced E-cadherin reduction and cells migration. Further experiments indicated a role of SUSD2 in conferring cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer probably through enhancing autophagy in vitro. Collectively, these findings shed a new insight into the role of Notch3 downstream gene SUSD2 and provided a new therapeutic target for HGSOC.

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the mostly diagnosed primary bone malignancy. Emerging evidence indicates that the activity of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform is crucial for the survival of tumor cells. In the present study, the effect of PKM2 knockdown on the proliferation and migration of OS cells were assessed both in vitro and in vivo. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) technology were employed to suppress the expression of PKM2 in MG-63 and Saos-2 cell lines. In vitro, shRNA-mediated knockdown of PKM2 efficiently inhibited cell proliferation, and induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in both cell lines, which was associated with decreased expressions of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 as well as increased expressions of Bax, cleaved-caspase-3, and cleaved-PARP. The invasion and migration potential of OS cell lines were also inhibited by PKM2 knockdown through the regulating effect of PKM2 on MMP-2 and VEGF signaling. In vivo, knockdown of PKM2 decelerated tumor growth rate and induced structure deterioration in tumor tissues. The current study for the first time showed that the activity of PKM2 was indispensable for the development and metastasis of OS, thereby providing the basic information for the future development of PKM2-based anti-OS therapies.

We previously reported expression of the transcription factor Sox17 in IAHCs, and overexpression of Sox17 in CD45lowc-KIThigh cells comprising IAHCs maintains the formation of cell clusters and their multipotency in vitro over multiple passages. Here, we demonstrate the importance of NOTCH1 in IAHC formation and maintenance of the HSC/HPC phenotype. We further show that Notch1 expression is positively regulated by SOX17 via direct binding to its gene promoter. SOX17 and NOTCH1 were both found to be expressed in vivo in cells of IAHCs by whole mount immunostaining. We found that cells transduced with the active form of NOTCH1 or its downstream target, Hes1, maintained their multipotent colony-forming capacity in semisolid medium. Moreover, cells stimulated by NOTCH1 ligand, Jagged1, or Delta-like protein 1, had the capacity to form multilineage colonies. Conversely, knockdown of Notch1 and Hes1 led to a reduction of their multipotent colony-forming capacity. These results suggest that the Sox17-Notch1-Hes1 pathway is critical for maintaining the undifferentiated state of IAHCs.

Abstract: Germ cell tumors (GCTs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors occurring in gonadal and extragonadal locations. GCTs are hypothesized to arise from primordial germ cells (PGCs), which fail to differentiate. One recently identified susceptibility loci for human GCT is PR (PRDI-BF1 and RIZ) domain proteins 14 (PRDM14). PRDM14 is expressed in early primate PGCs and is repressed as PGCs differentiate. To examine PRDM14 in human GCTs we profiled human GCT cell lines and patient samples and discovered that PRDM14 is expressed in embryonal carcinoma cell lines, embryonal carcinomas, seminomas, intracranial germinomas and yolk sac tumors, but is not expressed in teratomas. To model constitutive overexpression in human PGCs, we generated PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and discovered that elevated expression of PRDM14 does not block early PGC formation. Instead, we show that elevated PRDM14 in PGCLCs causes proliferation and differentiation defects in the germline.

Abstract: The mechanistic details of keloid formation are still not understood. Given that the immune system is engaged in skin lesion repair, we examined the CD14+ macrophages and CD3+ T cells in keloid tissues and in the normal skin. Compared to the normal skin, keloid tissues presented significantly elevated infiltration by CD14+ macrophages. Moreover, the transcription and protein expression of iNOS, IL-12, IL-10, and TGF-β were significantly higher in keloid macrophages than in normal skin macrophages, in which the expression of M2-associated genes were further elevated compared to M1-associated genes in keloid. We also observed that keloid tissues presented higher infiltration by CD3+ T cells, of which the majority was CD4+ T cells. Notably, the frequency of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in keloid tissues was significantly higher compared to that in the peripheral blood. Furthermore, macrophages from keloid tissues possessed potent capacity to induce Foxp3 expression in circulating CD3+ T cells. Together, this study suggested that macrophages in keloid tissues presented high activation status and were polarized toward the M2 subtype; moreover, these macrophages could promote Treg differentiation by upregulating Foxp3 expression.

Abstract: Insulin-producing cells (IPCs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold great potential for cell transplantation therapy in diabetes. Tremendous progress has been made in inducing differentiation of hESCs into IPCs in vitro, of which definitive endoderm (DE) protocol mimicking foetal pancreatic development has been widely used. However, immaturity of the obtained IPCs limits their further applications in treating diabetes. Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) is involved in the differentiation and functional maintenance of murine pancreatic β cells, but its role in human β cell differentiation is under elucidation. Here, we showed that although FoxO1 expression level remained consistent, cytoplasmic phosphorylated FoxO1 protein level increased during IPC differentiation of hESCs induced by DE protocol. Lentiviral silencing of FoxO1 in pancreatic progenitors upregulated the levels of pancreatic islet differentiation-related genes and improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion response in their progeny IPCs, whereas overexpression of FoxO1 showed the opposite effects. Notably, treatment with the FoxO1 inhibitor AS1842856 displayed similar effects with FoxO1 knockdown in pancreatic progenitors. These effects were closely associated with the mutually exclusive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of FoxO1 and Pdx1 in the AS1842856-treated pancreatic progenitors. Our data demonstrated a promising effect of FoxO1 inhibition by the small molecule on gene expression profile during the differentiation, and in turn, on determining IPC maturation via modulating subcellular location of FoxO1 and Pdx1. Therefore, we identify a novel role of FoxO1 inhibition in promoting IPC differentiation of hESCs, which may provide clues for induction of mature β cells from hESCs and clinical applications in regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Emerging evidences showed that miRNAs are involved in the oncogenesis of many cancers. Here, miRNA microarray analysis was performed to screen the significant miRNAs involved in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), miR-485-5p was chosen for further study. We found that the expression of miR-485-5p was significantly lower in CRC specimens and cell lines. In addition, low expression level of miR-485-5p is correlated with tumor progression and poor survival in CRC patients. Based on in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that miR-485-5p significantly inhibits CRC proliferation. Moreover, our results showed that miR-485-5p inhibits cell proliferation by reducing Bmi-1 protein expression, which has been reported to control the proliferation of many cancers. Mechanistically, OGT is a direct target of miR-485-5p, and miR-485-5p could inhibit the O-GlcNAcylation level of Bmi-1 by OGT. Overall, these results suggested that as a tumor suppressor, miR-485-5p may regulate CRC cells proliferation, which could regulate the O-GlcNAcylation and the stability of Bmi-1 through targeting OGT. This may give insight into a novel mechanism and therapy of CRC growth.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibiting protein function selectively is a major goal of modern drug discovery. Here, we report a previously understudied benefit of small molecule proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases to target proteins for their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Using promiscuous CRBN- and VHL-recruiting PROTACs that bind >50 kinases, we show that only a subset of bound targets is degraded. The basis of this selectivity relies on protein-protein interactions between the E3 ubiquitin ligase and the target protein, as illustrated by engaged proteins that are not degraded as a result of unstable ternary complexes with PROTAC-recruited E3 ligases. In contrast, weak PROTAC:target protein affinity can be stabilized by high-affinity target:PROTAC:ligase trimer interactions, leading to efficient degradation. This study highlights design guidelines for generating potent PROTACs as well as possibilities for degrading undruggable proteins immune to traditional small-molecule inhibitors.

Abstract: An α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compound of ginger, 6-Shogaol (6S), induced extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death in breast cancer cell (MDA-MB-231) and non-small lung cancer (A549) cells. In the presence of autophagic inhibitors the cells continued to exhibit cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death clearly distinguishing it from the classic autophagic process. 6S induced death did not exhibit the characteristic apoptotic features like caspase cleavage, phosphatidyl serine exposure and DNA fragmentation. The immunofluorescence with the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) resident protein, calreticulin indicated that the vacuoles were of ER origin, typical of paraptosis. This was supported by the increase in level of microtubule associated protein light chain 3B (LC3 I and LC3 II) and polyubiquitin binding protein, p62. The level of ER stress markers like polyubiquitinated proteins, Bip and CHOP also consistently increased. We have found that 6S inhibits the 26S proteasome. The proteasomal inhibitory activity was elucidated by a) molecular docking of 6S onto the active site of β5 subunit and b) reduced fluorescence by the fluorogenic substrate of the chymotrypsin-like subunit. In conclusion these studies demonstrate for the first time that proteasomal inhibition by 6S induces cell death via paraptosis. So 6-shogaol may act as a template for anti-cancer lead discovery against the apoptosis resistant cancer cells.

Abstract: Recent studies have reported significant advances in the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to clinically relevant cell types such as the insulin producing beta-like cells and motor neurons. However, many of the current differentiation protocols lead to heterogeneous cell cultures containing cell types other than the targeted cell fate. Genetically modified human pluripotent stem cells reporting the expression of specific genes are of great value for differentiation protocol optimization and for the purification of relevant cell populations from heterogeneous cell cultures. Here we present the generation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with a GFP reporter inserted in the endogenous NKX6.1 locus. Characterization of the reporter lines demonstrated faithful GFP labelling of NKX6.1 expression during pancreas and motor neuron differentiation. Cell sorting and gene expression profiling by RNA sequencing revealed that NKX6.1-positive cells from pancreatic differentiations closely resemble human beta cells. Furthermore, functional characterization of the isolated cells demonstrated that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is mainly confined to the NKX6.1-positive cells. We expect that the NKX6.1-GFP iPSC lines and the results presented here will contribute to the further refinement of differentiation protocols and characterization of hPSC-derived beta cells and motor neurons for disease modelling and cell replacement therapies.

Abstract: Extensive scar tissue formation often occurs after severe burn injury, trauma, or as one of complications after surgical intervention. Despite significant therapeutic advances, it is still a significant challenge to manage massive scar tissue formation while also promoting normal wound healing. The goal of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) that were genetically modified to overexpress transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGF-β3), an inhibitor of myofibroblast proliferation and collagen type I deposition, on full-thickness cutaneous wound healing in a rabbit model. Twenty-four rabbits with surgically-induced full-thickness cutaneous wounds created on the external ear (1.5 × 1.5 cm, two wounds/ear) were randomized into four groups: (G1), wounds with no special treatment but common serum-free culture medium as negative controls; (G2), topically-applied recombinant adenovirus, expressing TGF-β3/GFP; (G3), topically-applied BMSCs alone; (G4), topically-applied BMSCs transfected with Ad-TGF-β3/GFP (BMSCsTGF-β3); and (G5), an additional normal control (n = 2) with neither wound nor treatment on the external ear skin. The sizes of wounds on the ear tissues were grossly examined, and the scar depth and density of wounds were histologically evaluated 21, 45, and 90 days after surgical wound creation. Our results demonstrated that G4 significantly reduced the wound scar depth and density, compared to G1~3. Numbers of cells expressing GFP significantly increased in G4, compared to G2. The protein expression of TGF-β3 and type III collagen in G4 significantly increased, while the ratio of type I to type III collagen was also significantly reduced, which is similar to the tissue architecture found in G5, as compared the other treatment groups. In conclusion, transplantation of BMSCsTGF-β3 remarkably improves wound healing and reduces skin scar tissue formation in an animal model, which may potentially provide an alternative in the treatment of extensive scar tissue formation after soft tissue injury.

Abstract: Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is up-regulated and promotes migration, invasion and proliferation in wide range of cancers. However, we for the first time identify that PRMT1 promotes migration and invasion and inhibits proliferation in gastric cancer cells, a phenomenon called “migration-proliferation dichotomy”. First, we find that PRMT1 overexpression promotes migration and invasion and inhibits proliferation, whereas PRMT1 knockdown reverses the above abilities. Next, PRMT1 reduces the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin and increases the expression of mesenchymal markers including N-cadherin, Vimentin, snail and β-catenin in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, our studies show that PRMT1 silencing promotes the phosphorylation of LATS1, and then induces YAP phosphorylation, while overexpression of PRMT1 down-regulates the phosphorylation of LATS1 and YAP, indicating that PRMT1 inhibits EMT probably via Hippo signaling. Collectively, the present study reveals important roles of PRMT1 in progression of gastric cancer. Given the dual functions of PRMT1, it is as a potential drug target of gastric cancer with extreme caution.

Abstract: The first step in established spermatogenesis is the production of progenitor cells by the stem cell population. The progenitor cells (undifferentiated A spermatogonia) expand in number via the formation of syncytial chains by mitosis. The mechanism by which these progenitor cells commit to meiosis and spermatogenesis is tightly controlled and results in complex morphological organization all of which is designed to efficiently achieve large numbers of spermatozoa. The major extrinsic factor that triggers the commitment to meiosis and establishes the structural complexity is retinoic acid (RA). Retinoic acid is produced from retinol via two oxidation steps in low abundance near its site of action. The action of RA on undifferentiated A spermatogonia results in the timed progression of these progenitor cells into the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. We have utilized a drug WIN 18,446 that inhibits the second oxidation step in RA biosynthesis to block the progression of undifferentiated A spermatogonia in the mouse testis. As a result of this block the undifferentiated progenitor cells accumulate but do not differentiate into A1 spermatogonia. When the block is released and a bolus of RA is simultaneously administered the accumulated spermatogonia progress through the differentiation pathway in complete synchrony and maintain that synchrony with regard to stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium for several months. This procedure allowed us to accumulate sufficient material to measure retinoic acid levels across the cycle and will allow us to isolate and analyze large number of progenitor cells proceeding synchronously down the pathway to meiosis. We have been able to show that the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium is established and maintained by pulses of RA that appear at stages VIII and IX of the cycle.

Abstract: Iron overload (IO) caused by frequent blood transfusion in hematological diseases has become a major concern. In this study, up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a protector against oxidative stress, was observed in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) at the early stage of IO and had favorable prognosis in an IO mouse model. Given that the protective role of HO-1 in IO damage of BMMSCs was still unknown, the mechanism was explored in vitro and in vivo. BMMSCs were transfected with HO-1/siHO-1 in vitro, and the mouse model was established to further evaluate the effect of HO-1 on IO in vivo. As a result, HO-1 decreased the apoptotic rate of BMMSCs with IO through reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) but increasing IL-10 secretion. In addition, IL-10 was mediated by HO-1 via the ERK pathway. Intracellular iron was down-regulated by hepcidin depending on IL-10. In conclusion, HO-1 protects BMMSCs from ROS by secreting IL-10 upon iron overload.

Abstract: Disulfiram (DSF) in combination with copper (Cu) has been reported to override drug resistance in cancer cells, and DSF combined with chemotherapy based on the microtubule inhibitor vinorelbine appears to prolong survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying these findings. DSF/Cu reversed the microtubule inhibitor resistance in A549/Taxol and KB/VCR cells in vitro, and had anti-tumor effects in A549/Taxol and KB/VCR xenograft mice. DSF/Cu and DSF reduced the cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics of drug-resistant A549/Taxol and KB/VCR cells, including sphere formation, colony generation and migration, and DSF/Cu was more effective than DSF alone. DSF/Cu also decreased the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and the expression of P-gp and stem cell transcription factors in A549/Taxol and KB/VCR cells. Knockdown of ALDH2 attenuated the CSC characteristics of resistant cancer cells and enhanced their sensitivity to Taxol or VCR. Importantly, DSF/Cu treatment inhibited the expression of ALDH2 in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that DSF/Cu reverses microtubule inhibitor resistance in cancer cells by suppressing ALDH2 expression, and Cu improves the activity of DSF.

Abstract: Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most prevalent cancer worldwide. Specially, Hepatitis B viurs X protein (HBx) is a leading factor in the progression of Hepatitis B viurs-related HCC. Nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment also contributes to tumor development. However, the role of HBx in nutrient-deprived HCC has received little investigation. Here, we show that HBx elevates PINK1-Parkin mediating mitophagy in starvation. HBx not only increases the PINK1/Parkin gene expression but also accelerates Parkin recruitment to partial mitochondria. Further analysis indicates that, HBx either promotes mitochondrial unfolded protein response, with remarkable mitochondrial LONP1 increases, or reduces LONP1 expression in cytosol inducing LONP1-Parkin pathway, both consequently enhancing mitophagy. Moreover, the enhanced mitophagy lowers mitochondrial apoptosis in starved hepatoma cells, and Bax is implied in the machinery. In addition, we define differential centrifuge, 3000 g or 12,000 g to pellet mitochondria, as an effective method to obtain distinct mitochondria. In collect, HBx regulates diverse aspects of LONP1 and Parkin, enhancing mitophagy in starvation. This study may shed new insights into the machinery development of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano vesicular structures that are secreted by almost all kinds of cells. Exosomes are small EVs derived from endosomes, with a diameter between 30–100nm. Tumour-derived exosomes carry many molecules and factors from tumour cells. These exosomes are recognized and taken up by immunocytes. However, tumour-derived exosomes can not only suppress immune cell functions but also help tumours escape immune surveillance in the tumour microenvironment. The present work investigated the effect of exosomes derived from genetical modified K562 cells (GMK cells), which express IL-15, IL-18 and 4-1BBL (TNFSF9) on their surface. The results showed that these GME exosomes, carrying IL-15, IL-18 and 4-1BBL proteins similar to their host cells, could activate NK cells, increase the cytotoxicity of NK cells on some tumour cells in a short treatment (4h) and promote NK cells proliferation. However, with an extended treatment time (48h), these exosomes could inhibite the cytotoxicity of NK cells by inhibiting activated receptor expression on NK cells. These results indicated the bifacial effects of GMK exosomes on NK cells, which will be helpful to explore the possibility of using transformed exosomes as an anti-tumour immune vaccine or a therapeutic tool in future.

Abstract: Summary
During development, the mammary gland undergoes extensive remodeling driven by stem cells. Breast cancers are also hierarchically organized and driven by cancer stem cells characterized by CD44+CD24low/− or aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) expression. These markers identify mesenchymal and epithelial populations both capable of tumor initiation. Less is known about these populations in non-cancerous mammary glands. From RNA sequencing, ALDH+ and ALDH−CD44+CD24− human mammary cells have epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like characteristics, respectively, with some co-expressing ALDH+ and CD44+CD24− by flow cytometry. At the single-cell level, these cells have the greatest mammosphere-forming capacity and express high levels of stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-associated genes including ID1, SOX2, TWIST1, and ZEB2. We further identify single ALDH+ cells with a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype that express genes associated with aggressive triple-negative breast cancers. These results highlight single-cell analyses to characterize tissue heterogeneity, even in marker-enriched populations, and identify genes and pathways that define this heterogeneity.

Abstract: Insect nephrocytes provide a valuable model for kidney disease, as they are structurally and functionally homologous to mammalian kidney podocytes. They possess an exceptional macromolecular assembly, the nephrocyte diaphragm (ND), which serves as a filtration barrier and helps maintain tissue homeostasis by filtering out wastes and toxic products. However, the elements that maintain nephrocyte architecture and the ND are not understood. We show that Drosophila nephrocytes have a unique cytoplasmic cluster of F-actin, which is maintained by the microtubule cytoskeleton and Rho-GTPases. A balance of Rac1 and Cdc42 activity as well as proper microtubule organization and endoplasmic reticulum structure, are required to position the actin cluster. Further, ND proteins Sns and Duf also localize to this cluster and regulate organization of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Perturbation of any of these inter-dependent components impairs nephrocyte ultrafiltration. Thus cytoskeletal components, Rho-GTPases and ND proteins work in concert to maintain the specialized nephrocyte architecture and function.

Abstract: Hematopoietic differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide opportunities not only for fundamental research and disease modelling/drug testing but also for large-scale production of blood effector cells for future clinical application. Although there are multiple ways to differentiate human iPSCs towards hematopoietic lineages, there is a need to develop reproducible and robust protocols. Here we introduce an efficient way to produce three major blood cell types using a standardized differentiation protocol that starts with a single hematopoietic initiation step. This system is feeder-free, avoids EB-formation, starts with a hematopoietic initiation step based on a novel single cell-derived iPSC colony differentiation and produces multi-potential progenitors within 8–10 days. Followed by lineage-specific growth factor supplementation these cells can be matured into well characterized erythroid, megakaryocytic and myeloid cells with high-purity, without transcription factor overexpression or any kind of pre-purification step. This standardized differentiation system provides a simple platform to produce specific blood cells in a reproducible manner for hematopoietic development studies, disease modelling, drug testing and the potential for future therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) cardiomyocytes (CMs) show less negative resting membrane potential (RMP), which is attributed to small inward rectifier currents (IK1). Here, IK1 was measured in hiPSC-CMs (proprietary and commercial cell line) cultured as monolayer (ML) or 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) and, for direct comparison, in CMs from human right atrial (RA) and left ventricular (LV) tissue. RMP was measured in isolated cells and intact tissues. IK1 density in ML- and EHT-CMs from the proprietary line was similar to LV and RA, respectively. IK1 density in EHT-CMs from the commercial line was 2-fold smaller than in the proprietary line. RMP in EHT of both lines was similar to RA and LV. Repolarization fraction and IK,ACh response discriminated best between RA and LV and indicated predominantly ventricular phenotype in hiPSC-CMs/EHT. The data indicate that IK1 is not necessarily low in hiPSC-CMs, and technical issues may underlie low RMP in hiPSC-CMs.

Abstract: Summary
Lung epithelial cells (LECs) are strategically positioned in the airway mucosa to provide barrier defense. LECs also express pattern recognition receptors and a myriad of immune genes, but their role in immunity is often concealed by the activities of “professional” immune cells, particularly in the context of fungal infection. Here, we demonstrate that NF-κB signaling in LECs is essential for immunity against the pulmonary fungal pathogen Blastomyces dermatitidis. LECs orchestrate innate antifungal immunity by augmenting the numbers of interleukin-17A (IL-17A)- and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-producing innate lymphocytes, specifically “natural” Th17 (nTh17) cells. Innate lymphocyte-derived IL-17A and GM-CSF in turn enable phagocyte-driven fungal killing. LECs regulate the numbers of nTh17 cells via the production of chemokines such as CCL20, a process dependent on IL-1α-IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling on LECs. Therefore, LECs orchestrate IL-17A- and GM-CSF-mediated immunity in an IL-1R-dependent manner and represent an essential component of innate immunity to pulmonary fungal pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family is involved in various functions with maintenance of chromatin structure. During murine somatic cell reprogramming, we find that early depletion of HP1γ reduces the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, while late depletion enhances the process, with a concomitant change from a centromeric to nucleoplasmic localization and elongation-associated histone H3.3 enrichment. Depletion of heterochromatin anchoring protein SENP7 increased reprogramming efficiency to a similar extent as HP1γ, indicating the importance of HP1γ release from chromatin for pluripotency acquisition. HP1γ interacted with OCT4 and DPPA4 in HP1α and HP1β knockouts and in H3K9 methylation depleted H3K9M embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines. HP1α and HP1γ complexes in ESCs differed in association with histones, the histone chaperone CAF1 complex, and specific components of chromatin-modifying complexes such as DPY30, implying distinct functional contributions. Taken together, our results reveal the complex contribution of the HP1 proteins to pluripotency.

Abstract: Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are highly fragile with massive cell death after dissociation into single cells, which seriously hampers their applications. The mechanism underlying the massive cell death after dissociation still remains elusive. Here, the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, cell survival and mitochondrial membrane potential in dissociated hESCs before and after the treatments with a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 and p53 inhibitor Pifithrin α were investigated, respectively. Protein interactions were identified by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. The results show that the dissociation causes Caspase-dependent apoptosis in hESCs mediated by mitochondrial pathway with the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and elevation in pro-apoptotic Cyto c release, which are obviously suppresses by H89. The dissociation-induced increase of phosphorylated p53 Ser15 (p-p53) is suppressed by Pifithrin α which also rescues the elevated levels of pro-apoptotic proteins in mitochondrial pathway. During the dissociation-induced apoptosis, PKA/p-p53/Bax signaling pathway is identified by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence showing the most likely interaction between them. These results indicate that dissociation induces mitochondrial apoptosis in hESCs involving PKA/p-p53/Bax signaling pathway, which not only give new insights into the apoptosis mechanism of dissociated hESCs, but also provide clues for developing potential strategies to promote hESC survival after dissociation.

Abstract: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are increasingly implicated in the prevention and treatment of cancers apart from their known inhibitory effects on eicosanoid production. One of the NSAIDs, indomethacin, in particular shows promising antineoplastic outcome against glioma. To extend such finding, we here studied in human H4 and U87 glioma cells the possible involvement of the ceramide/protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A)/Akt axis in the indomethacin-induced apoptosis. We found that the induced apoptosis was accompanied by a series of biochemical events, including intracellular ceramide generation, PP2A activation, Akt dephosphorylation, Mcl-1 and FLICE inhibiting protein (FLIP) transcriptional downregulation, Bax mitochondrial distribution, and caspase 3 activation. Such events were also duplicated with a cell-permeable C2-ceramide and Akt inhibitor LY294002. Pharmacological inhibition of ceramide synthase by fumonisin B1 and PP2A by okadaic acid moderately attenuated indomethacin-induced Akt dephosphorylation along with the apoptosis. Results suggested that the ceramide/PP2A/Akt axis is involved in the apoptosis and a possible cyclooxygenase-independent target for indomethacin. Furthermore, apoptosis regulatory proteins such as Mcl-1 and FLIP are potential downstream effectors of this axis and their downregulation could turn on the apoptotic program.

Abstract: The spermatogonial transplantation technique was developed by Dr. Ralph Brinster in 1994. Transplanted spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) produce germ cell colonies after microinjection into the seminiferous tubules of infertile mice. This technique provided the first functional assay for SSCs. Although it became possible to produce transgenic animals using this transplantation technique in 2001, the lack of SSC culture systems prevented efficient genetic manipulation. To overcome this problem, a long-term SSC culture technique was developed in 2003. Cultured SSCs, designated as germline stem cells, allow drug selection of transfected SSCs, and knockout mice were produced in 2006. Using these techniques, it is now possible to address basic biological questions of SSC biology. They also open up new possibilities for male germline manipulation. In this review, we will briefly summarize our findings on SSCs and discuss unresolved issues that remain to be addressed.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac differentiation efficiency is hampered by inconsistencies and low reproducibility. We analyzed the differentiation process of multiple human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines in response to dynamic GSK3β inhibition under varying cell culture conditions. hPSCs showed strong differences in cell-cycle profiles with varying culture confluency. hPSCs with a higher percentage of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle exhibited cell death and required lower doses of GSK3β inhibitors to induce cardiac differentiation. GSK3β inhibition initiated cell-cycle progression via cyclin D1 and modulated both Wnt signaling and the transcription factor (TCF) levels, resulting in accelerated or delayed mesoderm differentiation. The TCF levels were key regulators during hPSC differentiation with CHIR99021. Our results explain how differences in hPSC lines and culture conditions impact cell death and cardiac differentiation. By analyzing the cell cycle, we were able to select for highly cardiogenic hPSC lines and increase the experimental reproducibility by predicting differentiation outcomes.

Abstract: Ubiquilin (UBQLN) plays a crucial role in cellular proteostasis through its involvement in the ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy. Mutations in the UBQLN2 gene have been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ALS with frontotemporal lobar dementia (ALS/FTLD). Previous studies reported a key role for UBQLN in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the mechanistic involvement of UBQLN in other neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. The genome of Drosophila contains a single UBQLN homolog (dUbqn) that shows high similarity to UBQLN1 and UBQLN2; therefore, the fly is a useful model for characterizing the role of UBQLN in vivo in neurological disorders affecting locomotion and learning abilities. We herein performed a phenotypic and molecular characterization of diverse dUbqn RNAi lines. We found that the depletion of dUbqn induced the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and caused morphological defects in various tissues. Our results showed that structural defects in larval neuromuscular junctions, abdominal neuromeres, and mushroom bodies correlated with limited abilities in locomotion, learning, and memory. These results contribute to our understanding of the impact of impaired proteostasis in neurodegenerative diseases and provide a useful Drosophila model for the development of promising therapies for ALS and FTLD.

Abstract: Microparticles (MPs) are small membrane-bound vesicles released from activated or dying cells. As shown previously, LPS stimulation of the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line can induce MP release, with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD increasing the extent of this process. Since combined treatment of cells with LPS and Z-VAD can induce necroptosis, we explored particle release during this form of cell death using flow cytometry to assess particle size, binding of annexin V and staining for DNA with propidium iodide (PI) and SYTO 13. The role of necroptosis was assessed by determining the effects of necrostatin, an inhibitor of RIP1, a kinase regulating this form of cell death. These studies demonstrated that, during necroptosis, RAW 264.7 cells release MPs that resemble those released from cells treated with staurosporine to induce apoptosis. The particles contained DNA as determined by binding of PI and SYTO 13, with PCR analysis demonstrating both chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA. The presence of mitochondria in the MP preparations was demonstrated by staining with MitoTracker Green. Flow cytometry indicated that purified mitochondria have properties of MPs. Together, these studies indicate that cells undergoing necroptosis can release MPs and that mitochondria can be components of MP preparations.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common types of acute leukemia in adults with the lowest survival rate of all leukemia. Resistance to cytarabine and anthracycline-based chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure. Thus, finding new drugs with anti-leukemia activities and minimal side effect is urgently needed. Here through screening more than 1000 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of United States, the anthelmintic drug mebendazole (MBZ) was found to inhibit the growth of AML cell lines (THP-1, U937, NB4 and K562) and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) from AML patients at pharmacologically achievable concentrations. In contrast, similar concentration of MBZ had little inhibitory effect on the growth of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In addition, MBZ induced mitotic arrest and mitotic catastrophe in AML cells based on nuclear morphology, cell cycle distribution, mitotic marker analyses and the number of multinucleated cells and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, MBZ treatment inhibited activation of Akt and Erk in AML leukemic cells. Finally, MBZ repressed the progression of leukemic cells in vivo and prolonged survival in AML xenograft mouse model. Taken together, our results suggest that MBZ could be a potential new therapeutic agent for the treatment of AML patients.

Abstract: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most malignant tumors in China with a poor prognosis. Most ESCC patients were diagnosed at advanced stages, losing the opportunity for surgical excision. Hence, it remains a pressing work to identify biomarkers for early detection, prognosis prediction and targeting therapies in ESCC. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) encodes a 15-kDa protein, and is involved in the post-translational modification (PTMs) of multiple proteins. However, the molecular functions of ISG15 in ESCC remain unclear. In this work, we found that ISG15 was aberrantly expressed in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Enhanced protein level of ISG15 promoted cellular malignant phenotypes including proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor formation in vivo. Consistently, reduction of ISG15 attenuated the cellular malignant phenotype in ESCC cell lines. Furthermore, gene-expression profiles suggested that the differentially expressed ISG15 affected the expression of a panel of genes enriched in the cell adherens junction, such as c-MET. Notably, as a secreted protein, the concentration of ISG15 was elevated in ESCC plasma than healthy individuals, acting as a potential diagnostic marker. Taken together, our results suggested a tumor promotion role of ISG15 in ESCC via c-MET/Fyn/β-catenin pathway.

Abstract: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most common sexual disorder that men report to healthcare providers. Gap junctions (GJs) are thought to be responsible for synchronous shrinkage of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CCSMCs), and play thus an important role in the maintenance of an erection. Hypoxia has been suggested as a pathological mechanism underlying ED. Here we demonstrate that hypoxia increased the expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and the main GJ component connexin (Cx)43 in CCSMCs. Inhibiting PDGF receptor (PDGFR) activity decreased Cx43 expression. Treatment with different concentrations of PDGF increased the levels of phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT), β-catenin, and Cx43, whereas inhibition of PDGFR or activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling altered β-catenin and Cx43 expression. Meanwhile, silencing β-catenin resulted in the downregulation of Cx43. These results demonstrate that PDGF secretion by CCSMCs and vascular endothelial cells is enhanced under hypoxic conditions, leading to increased Cx43 expression through PI3K/AKT/β-catenin signaling and ultimately affecting GJ function in ED. Thus, targeting this pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ED.

Abstract: Summary
The ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are well known for their role in maintaining naive pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that, jointly, TET1 and TET2 also safeguard the self-renewal potential of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) and have partially redundant roles in maintaining the epithelial integrity of TSCs. For the more abundantly expressed TET1, we show that this is achieved by binding to critical epithelial genes, notably E-cadherin, which becomes hyper-methylated and downregulated in the absence of TET1. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype of mutant TSCs is accompanied by centrosome duplication and separation defects. Moreover, we identify a role of TET1 in maintaining cyclin B1 stability, thereby acting as facilitator of mitotic cell-cycle progression. As a result, Tet1/2 mutant TSCs are prone to undergo endoreduplicative cell cycles leading to the formation of polyploid trophoblast giant cells. Taken together, our data reveal essential functions of TET proteins in the trophoblast lineage.

Abstract: Summary
In the developing nervous system, neural stem cells are polarized and maintain an apical domain facing a central lumen. The presence of apical membrane is thought to have a profound influence on maintaining the stem cell state. With the onset of neurogenesis, cells lose their polarization, and the concomitant loss of the apical domain coincides with a loss of the stem cell identity. Little is known about the molecular signals controlling apical membrane size. Here, we use two neuroepithelial cell systems, one derived from regenerating axolotl spinal cord and the other from human embryonic stem cells, to identify a molecular signaling pathway initiated by lysophosphatidic acid that controls apical membrane size and consequently controls and maintains epithelial organization and lumen size in neuroepithelial rosettes. This apical domain size increase occurs independently of effects on proliferation and involves a serum response factor-dependent transcriptional induction of junctional and apical membrane components.

Abstract: Environmental temperature is one of the important abiotic factors that influence the normal physiological function and productive performance of dairy cattle. Temperature stress evokes complex responses that are essential for safeguarding of cellular integrity and animal health. Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNA plays a key role cellular stress responses. The present study investigated the differential expression of miRNA in Frieswal (Holstein Friesian × Sahiwal) crossbred dairy cattle that are distinctly adapted to environmental temperature stress as they were evolved by using the temperate dairy breed Holstein Friesian. The results indicated that there was a significant variation in the physiological and biochemical indicators estimated under summer stress. The differential expression of miRNA was observed under heat stress when compared to the normal winter season. Out of the total 420 miRNAs, 65 were differentially expressed during peak summer temperatures. Most of these miRNAs were found to target heat shock responsive genes especially members of heat shock protein (HSP) family, and network analysis revealed most of them having stress-mediated effects on signaling mechanisms. Being greater in their expression profile during peak summer, bta-miR-2898 was chosen for reporter assay to identify its effect on the target HSPB8 (heat shock protein 22) gene in stressed bovine PBMC cell cultured model. Comprehensive understanding of the biological regulation of stress responsive mechanism is critical for developing approaches to reduce the production losses due to environmental heat stress in dairy cattle.

Abstract: The chemokine, CXCL12, promotes cancer growth and metastasis through interaction with either CXCR4 and/or CXCR7. This tumor-specific organization of the CXCL12 system obscures current therapeutic approaches, aiming at the selective inactivation of CXCL12 receptors. Since it has been previously suggested that the cellular use of CXCR4 or CXCR7 is dictated by the 5T4 oncofetal glycoprotein, we have now tested whether 5T4 would represent a general and reliable marker for the organization of the CXCL12 system in cancer cells. The CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, as well as the CXCR7 antagonist, CCX771, demonstrated that the cancer cell lines A549, C33A, DLD-1, MDA-231, and PC-3 use either CXCR7 and/or CXCR4 for mediating CXCL12-induced chemotaxis and cell proliferation. The use of CXCL12 receptors as well as their subcellular localization remained unchanged in most cell lines following siRNA-mediated depletion of 5T4. In distinct cell lines, inhibition of 5T4 expression, however, modulated tumor cell migration and proliferation per se. Collectively our analyses fail to demonstrate general organizational influences of 5T4 of the CXCL12 system in different cancer cell lines, and, hence, dismiss its future use as a diagnostic marker.

Abstract: Summary
The AIM2 inflammasome is activated by DNA, leading to caspase-1 activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, which are critical mediators in host innate immune responses against various pathogens. Some viruses employ strategies to counteract inflammasome-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but their in vivo relevance is less well understood. Here we show that the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) tegument protein VP22 inhibits AIM2-dependent inflammasome activation. VP22 interacts with AIM2 and prevents its oligomerization, an initial step in AIM2 inflammasome activation. A mutant virus lacking VP22 (HSV-1ΔVP22) activates AIM2 and induces IL-1β and IL-18 secretion, but these responses are lost in the absence of AIM2. Additionally, HSV-1ΔVP22 infection results in diminished viral yields in vivo, but HSV-1ΔVP22 replication is largely restored in AIM2-deficient mice. Collectively, these findings reveal a mechanism of HSV-1 evasion of the host immune response that enables efficient viral replication in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the molecular pathways controlling hematopoietic stem cell specification and expansion is a necessary milestone to perform regenerative medicine. Here, we used the zebrafish model to study the role of the ckit signaling pathway in this process. We show the importance of kitb/kitlgb signaling in the specification and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), in the hemogenic endothelium and caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT), respectively. Moreover, we identified the zebrafish ortholog of Oncostatin M (osm) in the zebrafish genome. We show that the osm/osmr pathway acts upstream of kitb during specification of the hemogenic endothelium, while both pathways act synergistically to expand HSCs in the CHT. Moreover, we found that osm, in addition to its role in promoting HSC proliferation, inhibits HSC commitment to the lymphoid fate. Altogether, our data identified two cytokines, kitlgb and osm, secreted by the vascular niche, that control HSCs during early embryonic development.

Abstract: Summary
Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) accounts for >130 million human infections annually. Since chronic Ctr infections are extremely difficult to treat, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutics. As an obligate intracellular bacterium, Ctr strictly depends on the functional contribution of the host cell. Here, we combined a human genome-wide RNA interference screen with metabolic profiling to obtain detailed understanding of changes in the infected cell and identify druggable pathways essential for Ctr growth. We demonstrate that Ctr shifts the host metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis, consistent with increased biomass requirement. We identify key regulator complexes of glucose and nucleotide metabolism that govern Ctr infection processes. Pharmacological targeting of inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, efficiently inhibits Ctr growth both in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight the potency of genome-scale functional screening for the discovery of drug targets against bacterial infections.

Abstract: Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is an essential event in the initiation and progression of liver fibrosis. HSCs are believed to be the major source of collagen-producing myofibroblasts in fibrotic livers. A key feature in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis is fibrillar Collagen I (Col 1) deposition. Osteopontin (OPN), an extracellular matrix (ECM) cytokine expressed in HSCs, could drive fibrogenesis by modulating the HSC pro-fibrogenic phenotype and Col 1 expression. Here, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of OPN regulating the activation of HSCs. Our results showed that hepatic expression of OPN was increased in patients with liver fibrosis. In addition, hepatic OPN was positively correlated with Col 1 and α-SMA. Recombinant OPN (rOPN) upregulated Col 1 and α-SMA expression in LX-2 cells. However, OPN knockdown downregulated Col 1 expression. The 3′-UTR of the collagen 1 (Col 1) was identified to bind miR-129-5p. Transfection of miR-129-5p mimic in HSC resulted in a marked reduction of Col 1 expression. Conversely, a decrease in miR-129-5p in HSCs transfected by anti-sense miR-129-5p (AS-miR-129-5p) caused Col 1 upregulation. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-129-5p directly target the 3′-UTR of Col1α1 mRNA via repressing its post-transcriptional activities. Finally, miR-129-5p level was decreased in fibrotic liver of human, and reduced by rOPN treatment. In contrast, miR-129-5p was induced in HSCs transfected by OPN siRNA. These data suggested that OPN induces Col 1 expression via suppression of miR-129-5p in HSCs.

Abstract: Aims
Although the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling systems synergistically regulate many essential developmental and regenerative processes in lung cancer, the mechanisms of their crosstalk remain poorly defined. Our study aimed to investigate an interaction between EGFR and the β-catenin signal.
Results
In this study, we described a potent activation of β-catenin by EGFR, which is dependent of the PtdIns3K/AKT pathway. We found EGF activated β-catenin signaling via phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT in EGFR-mutated PC-9 lung cancer cells. Meanwhile, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) regulated cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) by inhibiting autophosphorylation of EGFR and downstream signaling proteins, as well as β-catenin. Further, β-catenin depletion by RNA interference virtually eliminated cancer stem cell-like population in PC-9 cells in vitro. The nude mice transplantation model was also performed to confirm EGFR-TKIs strongly inhibited the β-catenin signal and decreased CSCs. Importantly, the reduction of CSCs that sorted out by side population (SP) cells significantly reduced the migration capability. Thus, our results improved the understanding of this process to provide insights into mechanisms of responding to EGFR-TKIs.
Conclusions
Our discoveries raise an intriguing question of the role of β-catenin in EGFR-TKIs-treated cancer stem cell-like population(s) and its potential as a new therapeutic target for NSCLC in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Perturbations in stress granule (SG) dynamics may be at the core of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Since SGs are membraneless compartments, modeling their dynamics in human motor neurons has been challenging, thus hindering the identification of effective therapeutics. Here, we report the generation of isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells carrying wild-type and P525L FUS-eGFP. We demonstrate that FUS-eGFP is recruited into SGs and that P525L profoundly alters their dynamics. With a screening campaign, we demonstrate that PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibition increases autophagy and ameliorates SG phenotypes linked to P525L FUS by reducing FUS-eGFP recruitment into SGs. Using a Drosophila model of FUS-ALS, we corroborate that induction of autophagy significantly increases survival. Finally, by screening clinically approved drugs for their ability to ameliorate FUS SG phenotypes, we identify a number of brain-penetrant anti-depressants and anti-psychotics that also induce autophagy. These drugs could be repurposed as potential ALS treatments.

Abstract: The use of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal cultures to study the mechanisms of neurological disorders is often limited by low efficiency and high variability in differentiation of functional neurons. Here we compare the functional properties of neurons in cultures prepared with two hiPSC differentiation protocols, both plated on astroglial feeder layers. Using a protocol with an expandable intermediate stage, only a small percentage of cells with neuronal morphology were excitable by 21–23days in culture. In contrast, a direct differentiation strategy of the same hiPSC line produced cultures in which the majority of neurons fired action potentials as early as 4–5days. By 35–38days over 80% of the neurons fired repetitively and many fired spontaneously. Spontaneous post-synaptic currents were observed in ~40% of the neurons at 4–5days and in ~80% by 21–23days. The majority (75%) received both glutamatergic and GABAergic spontaneous postsynaptic currents. The rate and degree of maturation of excitability and synaptic activity was similar between multiple independent platings from a single hiPSC line, and between two different control hiPSC lines. Cultures of rapidly functional neurons will facilitate identification of cellular mechanisms underlying genetically defined neurological disorders and development of novel therapeutics.

Abstract: Endothelial cells (ECs) are exposed to various environmental forces, and a Ca2+ wave is occurred in mechanical stimulated cells. Pharmacological studies reveal that the translocation of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) to the membrane is observed simultaneously with intracellular Ca2+ wave. In this study, we investigate whether and how the kinetics of PKCα in ECs is induced in response to mechanical stress. The results show that a mechanical stimulus induced biphasic and directional PKCα translocation; PKCα initially translocated near or at the membrane and then accumulated at the stimulus point. The initial translocation occurred simultaneously with Ca2+ increase. Initial translocation was inhibited in spite of Ca2+ increase when the diacylglycerol (DAG) binding domain of PKCα was inhibited, suggesting that translocation requires intracellular Ca2+ increase and DAG. On the other hand, secondary translocation was delayed, occurring after the Ca2+ wave; however, this translocation occurred even when Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum was inhibited, while it did not occur when the mechanosensitive (MS) channel was inhibited. These results indicated that at least Ca2+ influx from extracellular space through MS channel is required. Our results support the implication of PKCα in the Ca2+ signaling pathway in response to mechanical stress in ECs.

Abstract: Macrophages view as double agents in tumor progression. Trafficking of macrophages to the proximity of tumors is mediated by colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), a growth factor. In this study, we investigated the role of complement1q-binding protein (C1QBP)/ atypical protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ) in CSF-1-induced macrophage migration. Disruption of C1QBP expression impaired chemotaxis and adhesion of macrophage. Phosphorylation of PKCζ is an essential component in macrophage chemotaxis signaling pathway. C1QBP could interact with PKCζ in macrophage. C1QBP knockdown inhibited CSF-1 induced phosphorylation of PKCζ and integrin-β1. However, C1QBP knockdown didn’t affect the phosphorylation of PKCζ induced by MCP-1. Furthermore, CSF-1 from RCC cell condition medium promoted macrophage chemotaxis and adhesion. Taken together, our results demonstrated that C1QBP plays an essential role in CSF-1 induced migration of macrophages.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most lethal human malignant tumor because of the early onset of local invasion and distant metastasis. Perineural invasion is a prominent characteristic of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which is a multifactorial process that involves various signaling molecules from different signaling pathways. The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family of ligands was reported to be involved in perineural invasion in pancreatic cancer. Artemin is one member of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family of ligands. Although Artemin has previously been demonstrated to promote invasiveness of pancreatic cancer, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed an analysis to determine the effects of Artemin on modulating tumor cell metastatic potential and invasion activity and explored its mechanisms in pancreatic cancer. We indicated that Artemin and CXCR4 were overexpressed in cancer tissues and widely expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines. We observed that activation of ERK1/2 and Akt in Artemin-treated cells led to enhanced nuclear accumulation of NF-κB, which then induced CXCR4 expression. Through regulation of the expression of CXCR4, Artemin functionally promoted the migration and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells. The present study indicated that Artemin induced CXCR4 expression by activating Akt and ERK 1/2/NF-κB signaling, thereby modulating tumor cell metastatic potential and invasion activity in pancreatic cancer by regulating SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis. Artemin might be an effective and potent therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer metastasis, especially in perineural invasion.

Abstract: Epiphyseal growth plate is highly dynamic tissue which is controlled by a variety of endocrine, paracrine hormones, and by complex local signaling loops and mechanical loading. Mechano growth factor (MGF), the splice variant of the IGF-I gene, has been discovered to play important roles in tissue growth and repair. However, the effect of MGF on the growth plate remains unclear. In the present study, we found that MGF mRNA expression of growth plate chondrocytes was upregulated in response to mechanical stimuli. Treatment of MGF had no effect on growth plate chondrocytes proliferation and differentiation. But it could inhibit growth plate chondrocytes apoptosis and inflammation under mechanical overload. Moreover, both wound healing and transwell assay indicated that MGF could significantly enhance growth plate chondrocytes migration which was accompanied with YAP activation and nucleus translocation. Knockdown of YAP with YAP siRNA suppressed migration induced by MGF, indicating the essential role of YAP in MGF promoting growth plate chondrocytes migration. Furthermore, MGF promoted YAP activation through RhoA GTPase mediated cytoskeleton reorganization, RhoA inhibition using C3 toxin abrogated MGF induced YAP activation. Importantly, we found that MGF promoted focal adhesion(FA) formation and knockdown of YAP with YAP siRNA partially suppressed the activation of FA kinase, implying that YAP is associated with FA formation. In conclusion, MGF is an autocrine growth factor which is regulated by mechanical stimuli. MGF could not only protect growth plate chondrocytes against damage by mechanical overload, but also promote migration through activation of RhoA/YAP signaling axis. Most importantly, our findings indicate that MGF promote cell migration through YAP mediated FA formation to determine the FA-cytoskeleton remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of additional uses for existing drugs is a hot topic in drug discovery and a viable alternative to de novo drug development. HAMI3379 is known as an antagonist of the cysteinyl-leukotriene CysLT2 receptor, and was initially developed to treat cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders. In our study we identified HAMI3379 as an antagonist of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR17. HAMI3379 inhibits signaling of recombinant human, rat, and mouse GPR17 across various cellular backgrounds, and of endogenous GPR17 in primary rodent oligodendrocytes. GPR17 blockade by HAMI3379 enhanced maturation of primary rat and mouse oligodendrocytes, but was without effect in oligodendrocytes from GPR17 knockout mice. In human oligodendrocytes prepared from inducible pluripotent stem cells, GPR17 is expressed and its activation impaired oligodendrocyte differentiation. HAMI3379, conversely, efficiently favored human oligodendrocyte differentiation. We propose that HAMI3379 holds promise for pharmacological exploitation of orphan GPR17 to enhance regenerative strategies for the promotion of remyelination in patients.

Abstract: Cell division is managed by a complex and coordinated sequence of cytoskeleton alterations that give rise to major morphological changes. During dividing the cleavage furrow of the cell is significantly stiffened due to the accumulation of actomyosin. However, it is unclear whether the stiffness on top of the cell is changed or not. Here, we used atomic force microscopy to measure stiffness on this location of non-adhesion Jurkat T cell and its derivative D1.1 cell from interphase to cytokinesis. The results showed that during division the cell stiffness significantly increases at anaphase and telophase. These increases in cell stiffness are most likely due to the cell surface tension created by the pulling forces of the microtubules to separate sister chromatids in the anaphase and the contraction forces of the contractile ring to separate the mother cell into daughters in the telophase. The dynamic measurement of cell elasticity during cell division may be used as a tool to gain further insight into the involved molecules and mechanisms.

Abstract: Summary
The tuberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has heterologous beneficial effects against non-related infections. The basis of these effects has been poorly explored in humans. In a randomized placebo-controlled human challenge study, we found that BCG vaccination induced genome-wide epigenetic reprograming of monocytes and protected against experimental infection with an attenuated yellow fever virus vaccine strain. Epigenetic reprogramming was accompanied by functional changes indicative of trained immunity. Reduction of viremia was highly correlated with the upregulation of IL-1β, a heterologous cytokine associated with the induction of trained immunity, but not with the specific IFNγ response. The importance of IL-1β for the induction of trained immunity was validated through genetic, epigenetic, and immunological studies. In conclusion, BCG induces epigenetic reprogramming in human monocytes in vivo, followed by functional reprogramming and protection against non-related viral infections, with a key role for IL-1β as a mediator of trained immunity responses.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and differentiation in the developing brain is a complex process precisely regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Although epigenetic modification has been reportedly involved in the regulation of the cerebral cortex, whether UTX, an H3K27me3 demethylase, regulates the development of cerebral cortex during the embryonic period is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that Utx deficiency by knockdown and conditional knockout increases NSC proliferation and decreases terminal mitosis and neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we find that impairment of cortical development caused by lack of Utx is less significant in males than in females. In addition, UTX demethylates H3K27me3 at the Pten promoter and promotes Pten expression. P-AKT and P-mTOR levels are increased in the Utx conditional knockout cortices. Finally, Utx or Pten overexpression can rescue the impairment of brain development caused by Utx loss. These findings may provide important clues toward deciphering brain diseases.

Abstract: Various studies revealed that numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found dysregulated in HCC and played important role in hepatocarcinogenesis, although the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. Herein, we reported AF119895, a new lncRNA which was identified from microarray and amplified in HCC. Functionally, AF119895 promoted migration and invasion of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we identified that NXF3 was a downstream target of AF119895. NXF3 depletion could decrease HCC cells migration and invasion. In addition, AF119895 could act as an endogenous sponge by binding to miR-6508-3p and reduce miR-6508-3p expression. And miR-6508-3p could regulate NXF3 by interacting with its 3′UTR. These observations collectively demonstrate that AF119895 modulates the repression of NXF3 by binding to miR-6508-3p. Our results outline a novel signaling pathway mediated by AF119895 and suggest its candidacy as a new prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target of HCC.

Abstract: Peritoneal metastasis is a major cause of recurrence of gastric cancer and integrins are key molecules involved in gastric cancer cells attachment to the peritoneum. The peptide hormone, gastrin, initially identified for its role in gastric acid secretion is also a growth factor for gastric mucosa. Gastrin has also been shown to contribute to gastric cancers progression. Here, we provide the first evidence that gastrin increases the adhesion of gastric cancer cells. Gastrin treatment induces the expression of α2 integrin subunit through a mechanism that involves the ERK pathway. We also observed in response to gastrin an increase in the amount of α2 integrin associated with β1subunit. In addition, gastrin-stimulated cell adhesion was blocked with an anti-α2β1 integrin neutralizing antibody. We also show that gastrin activates the integrin pathway via the phosphorylation of β1 integrin by a Src family kinase. This mechanism may contribute to the enhancement of cell adhesion observed in response to gastrin since we found an inhibition of gastrin-mediated cell adhesion when cells were treated with a Src inhibitor. By regulating one of the key step of the metastatic process gastrin might contribute to increase the aggressive behaviour of human gastric tumours.

Abstract: Activating mutations of RAS genes, particularly KRAS, are detected with high frequency in human tumors. Mutated Ras proteins constitutively activate the ERK pathway (Raf–MEK–ERK phosphorylation cascade), leading to cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. DA-Raf1 (DA-Raf) is a splicing variant of A-Raf and contains the Ras-binding domain (RBD) but lacks the kinase domain. Accordingly, DA-Raf antagonizes the Ras–ERK pathway in a dominant-negative fashion and suppresses constitutively activated K-Ras-induced cellular transformation. Thus, we have addressed whether DA-Raf serves as a tumor suppressor of Ras-induced tumorigenesis. DA-Raf(R52Q), which is generated from a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the RBD, and DA-Raf(R52W), a mutant detected in a lung cancer, neither bound to active K-Ras nor interfered with the activation of the ERK pathway. They were incapable of suppressing activated K-Ras-induced cellular transformation and tumorigenesis in mice, in which K-Ras-transformed cells were transplanted. Furthermore, although DA-Raf was highly expressed in lung alveolar epithelial type 2 (AE2) cells, its expression was silenced in AE2-derived lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with oncogenic KRAS mutations. These results suggest that DA-Raf represents a tumor suppressor protein against Ras-induced tumorigenesis.
