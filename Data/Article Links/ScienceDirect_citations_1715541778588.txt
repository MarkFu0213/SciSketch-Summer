Abstract: One-step fabrication of the chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorber layer without excess Se supply during/after deposition or post-selenization treatments is reported. By using pulse DC sputtering from a single quaternary CIGS target, the chalcopyrite structure is spontaneously developed on the substrate at 500°C even without extra Se supply. The obtained CIGS absorber layer possesses columnar grains with (112) preferred orientation. Device efficiency of 8.22% is observed for slightly Se-deficient CIGS films. By further tuning the target composition, the efficiency is enhanced to 10.14%. We demonstrate that the device-quality CIGS absorber can be formed even in the Se-deficient environment and further improvement of efficiency can be achieved by tuning the Se content of the target. Accordingly, our one-step sputtering process shows great potential for mass production of thin film CIGS solar cells with a low cost and a high throughput.

Abstract: Excess carrier photoconductance decay lifetime, measured under small perturbation conditions imposed on steady-state generation, offers an attractive and parameter free alternative to quasi-steady-state photoconductance, QSSPC. A recent version of this technique referred to as QSS-μPCD is based on microwave reflectance PCD monitoring. For this technique, it is critically important to maintain a mono-exponential decay over a large range of steady-state light intensity. Toward that goal we present QSS-μPCD with stringent quality of decay control, QDC. The quality of decay parameter, QD (ideally QD=1) measures the direction and magnitude of departures from an ideal exponential transient and enables tuning toward an optimal range of experimental variables, both apparatus and wafer dependent, whereby QD is within 1±Δ where Δ defines the QDC limits. Within QDC limits, the small perturbation effective decay lifetime, τeff.d, enables accurate determination of important silicon PV parameters, up to about 25 suns, including J0 and the steady-state lifetime, τeff.ss. Two J0 procedures are compared. The ingenious analytical procedure adopted from Basore and Hansen (1990) [2] enables direct determination of J0. The second J0 procedure uses integration of τeff.d over illumination intensity. The results are self-consistent and they show excellent correlation with Sinton QSSPC results.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder, manifests when the PNH clone populates in the hematopoietic compartment. We explored the roles of different apoptosis of GPI+ and GPI- (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) cells and CD8+ lymphocytes in a selection of PNH clones.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Granulocytes from PNH patients and normal controls were subjected to an apoptosis assay using annexin V. Hematopoietic cell in semisolid media were cultured with or without CD8+ lymphocytes.
RESULTS
In PNH, CD59+ granulocytes exhibited more apoptosis than their CD59- counterparts, after 0 or 4 hours in liquid growth culture system (mean [standard error of mean]: 2.1 (0.5) vs 1.2 (0.2), P=.01 at 0 hour and 3.4 [0.7] vs 1.8 [0.3], P=.03 at 4 hour, respectively). The presence of mononuclear cells (MNCs) rendered a greater difference in apoptosis. The percentages of apoptotic CD59+ granulocytes measured at 4 hours with or without MNC fraction were correlated with the sizes of PNH clones (r=0.633, P=.011; and r=0.648, P=.009; respectively). The autologous CD8+ lymphocytes inhibited CFU-GM and BFU-E colony formation in PNH patients when compared with normal controls (mean [SEM] of percentages of inhibition: 61.7 (10.4) vs 11.9 (2.0), P=.008 for CFU-GM and 26.1 (6.9) vs 4.9 (1.0), P=.037 for BFU-E).
CONCLUSIONS
Increased apoptosis of GPI+blood cells is likely to be responsible in selection and expansion of PNH clones. MNCs or possibly CD8+ lymphocytes may play a role in this phenomenon.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) constitutes a predominant part of primary liver cancer which ranks as the fifth most common cancer as well as the third most common cause of cancer mortality. In view of the poor prognosis of unresectable liver cancers, it is of pivotal importance to develop novel chemotherapeutical regimens. RNase MC2 is a 14-kDa ribonuclease isolated from dietary bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) that manifested antitumor potential against breast cancers. In this study, we investigated the potential application of RNase MC2 on Hep G2 cells. We showed that RNase MC2 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in both in vitro and in vivo studies. RNase MC2 treatment caused cell cycle arrest predominantly at the S-phase and apoptosis, which is associated with the activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9 regulated caspase pathways. Our further investigation disclosed that RNase MC2 down-regulated the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bak. Moreover, the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK was involved in the apoptosis process. Importantly, RNase MC2 significantly suppressed the growth of Hep G2 xenograft-bearing nude mice by inducing apoptosis. This notion is supported by data indicating an increased number of caspase-3- and PARP-positive cells, and TUNEL-positive cells in RNase MC2-treated tumor tissues. In summary, we have revealed the antitumor potential of RNase MC2 toward Hep G2 cells. Considering that bitter gourd is a common dietary component in many countries, this study may help to prompt the clinical application of RNase MC2.

Abstract: The biological responses of human haematopoietic cells of myeloid lineage following malignant transformation depends crucially on their adaptation to signalling stress. This adaptation is dependent on the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) transcription complex, although the mechanisms underlying its control remain unclear. Here, we report that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, a central regulator of myeloid cell growth and metabolism, is crucially involved in HIF-1α accumulation/HIF-1 activation in human THP-1 myeloid monocytes, LAD2 mast cells and primary basophils in a variety of different settings. In THP-1 cells, mTOR was a major contributor to HIF-1 activation induced by ligands of both membrane-associated and endosomal toll-like receptors that recognise molecular patterns shared by pathogens. In LAD2 mast cells and primary human basophils mTOR was vital for HIF-1α accumulation/HIF-1 activity during immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent pro-allergic responses as well as in maintaining constitutive HIF-1α levels in mast cells. Furthermore, we observed that nitric oxide synthase activity was dependent on mTOR in these myeloid cells and involved in HIF-1α accumulation mediated by endosomal toll-like receptor 7/8 triggering in THP-1 cells as well as IgE-dependent basophil, but not mast cell, responses. In both cases the process is likely to be associated with an impact of reactive nitrogen species on HIF-1α-degrading prolyl hydroxylation. These studies underline the importance of mTOR as a fundamental regulator of HIF-1 signalling in myeloid cells.

Abstract: Sphingosine kinase 1 catalyses the formation of the bioactive lipid, sphingosine 1-phosphate and is a target for anti-cancer agents. We demonstrate here that 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl)thiazole (SKi, also referred to as SKI-II), FTY720 (Fingolimod), and (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate inhibit sphingosine kinase 1 activity with distinct kinetics, indicating that these compounds exhibit different binding modalities with sphingosine kinase 1. Thus, SKi is a mixed inhibitor of sphingosine and ATP binding, whereas FTY720 is competitive with sphingosine and uncompetitive with ATP, and (S)-FTY720 vinylphosphonate is uncompetitive with sphingosine and is a mixed inhibitor with respect to ATP. A novel ‘see-saw’ model is proposed for the binding of inhibitor to catalytic and allosteric sites, the latter dependent on substrate binding, that provides an explanation for the different inhibitor kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that the expression level and properties unique to an N-terminal 86 amino-acid isoform variant of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1b) in prostate cancer cells reduce its sensitivity to SKi-induced proteasomal degradation in comparison to SK1a, i.e. these two N-terminal variants of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1a and SK1b) have different properties. The reduced sensitivity of SK1b to proteasomal degradation in response to SKi is translated into specific changes in ceramide and S1P levels that leads to apoptosis of androgen-sensitive but not androgen-independent LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Therefore, our proposed ‘see-saw’ model might be usefully employed in the design of sphingosine kinase inhibitors to promote apoptosis of chemotherapeutic resistant cancer cells.

Abstract: Air conditioning and lighting costs can be reduced substantially by changing the optical properties of “intelligent windows.” The electrochromic devices studied to date have used copper as an additive. Copper, used here as an electrochromic material, was dissolved in an aqueous animal protein-derived gel electrolyte. This combination constitutes the electrochromic system for reversible electrodeposition. Cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometric and chromogenic analyses indicated that were obtained good conditions of transparency (initial transmittance of 70%), optical reversibility, small potential window (2.1V), variation of transmittance in visible light (63.6%) and near infrared (20%) spectral regions. Permanence in the darkened state was achieved by maintaining a lower pulse potential (−0.16V) than the deposition potential (−1.0V). Increasing the number of deposition and dissolution cycles favored the transmittance and photoelectrochemical reversibility of the device. The conductivity of the electrolyte (10−3S/cm) at several concentrations of CuCl2 was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the good thermal stability of the electrolyte, since the mass loss detected up to 100°C corresponded to water evaporation and decomposition of the gel started only at 200°C. Micrographic and small angle X-ray scattering analyses indicated the formation of a persistent deposit of copper particles on the ITO.

Abstract: An inherently safe method of preparing crystalline quaternary chalcogenides, which are of interest to photovoltaic applications, has been developed. Mixed sulfide/selenide derivatives with a general formula of Cu2ZnSnSxSe4−x, where x ranges from x=4 to x=0, were prepared in good chemical and phase purity from binary sulfides or elements in molten cesium-containing salts, and the products were isolated and characterized by X-ray analysis. The unit cells for the sulfide/selenide series show a linear expansion with increasing levels of selenium. Morphology of Cu2ZnSnS4 crystals can be controlled by the nature of the flux, e.g., from trilled needles in CsCl flux to isotropic polyhedrons in CsCl/BaCl2. Purity estimates by Rietveld refinements of X-ray data were found to be 99% for Cu2ZnSnS4, 97% for Cu2ZnGeS4, and 98% for Cu2CdSnS4.

Abstract: The application of luminescent down-shifting (LDS) has been shown to improve the short wavelength response of a variety of different photovoltaic devices. Cadmium sulphide/cadmium telluride (CdS/CdTe) heterojunction devices possess a great potential for improvement via LDS due to the parasitic absorption of blue light by the CdS buffer layer. This work is the first to investigate LDS applied to mini-modules (72cm2 active area) cut from full-size CdTe modules from a production line. The addition of LDS layers containing Lumogen Yellow 083 and Violet 570 dyes was demonstrated to increase the short circuit current density (JSC) of the mini-module by up to 9% relative. It was shown that the addition of the Yellow 083 dye alone more than doubles the short wavelength (300–500nm) response of CdTe mini-modules. External quantum efficiency measurements are presented that clearly identified the wavelength range of photocurrent enhancement, while increased efficiency was confirmed with current–voltage (I–V) measurements.

Abstract: Dendritic cells (DC) are sentinels of the immune system deriving from circulating monocyte precursors recruited to sites of inflammation. In a previous report (Del Prete et al., 2008) we showed that, after differentiation, DC exhibited increased number of condensed mitochondria and dynamic changes in their energy metabolism. A study is presented here showing that the DC differentiation process is characterized by increased expression level and activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, as well as by an increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. Moreover, DC are equipped with more efficient antioxidant protection systems, over expressed most likely to detoxify increased ROS production, as a consequence of the much higher mitochondrial activity. Kinetic analysis of the three main mitochondrial biogenesis-associated genes revealed that the peak in PPARγ coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1α) gene expression was suddenly reached few hours after the onset of the differentiation. While PGC-1α expression rapidly declines, the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) expression gradually increased. These findings demonstrate that an active mitochondrial biogenesis occurs during DC differentiation and further suggest that an early input by the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis PGC-1α is needed to trigger the subsequent activation of the downstream transcription factors, NRF-1 and TFAM in this process.

Abstract: Light-trapping textures were produced in hyperbranched polymer (HBP) silica nanocomposites using a UV-nanoimprint lithography (UVNIL) replication method, either in batch or roll-to-roll processes. The hardness of the HBP was found to increase by a factor of 2.5 with the addition of 50vol% of nanoparticles. A nickel master with random sub-micron pyramidal structures was used to imprint nanocomposites containing up to 20vol% of silica on a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate. The influence of nanoparticle fraction and pressure on the texture morphology and light scattering properties of the replicas was studied using scanning electron microscopy and optical analysis. The roughness and coherence length of the textures were similar to those of the master for all investigated compositions and process pressures. Likewise, the light scattering performance of aluminum-coated texturized nanocomposites was identical to that of the metal template, with a haze of 90% over the 400–800nm spectral range. Thin film amorphous silicon solar cells were deposited on the texturized substrates using a large-area roll-to-roll process. The photocurrent of these devices was found to be 23% higher than the reference value of a flat cell.

Abstract: Nanotextured Ag back reflectors were used to enhance the short-circuit current of flexible silicon thin-film solar cells with an n-i-p configuration by means of optical confinement. A nanotextured topography with a root-mean-square (σrms) surface roughness of 88.0nm was successfully induced by abnormal grain growth of Ag films, which was controlled by varying the deposition temperature and film thickness in a direct current (dc) magnetron sputtering process. Effective light scattering of the long wavelengths over 600nm was achieved on the nano-textured Ag back reflectors, resulting in enhanced absorption of weakly absorbing, long-wavelength light in the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and microcrystalline silicon (μc-Si:H) thin-film solar cells. Compared with similar reference cells on flat back reflectors, a 34.4% increase in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) for an a-Si:H solar cell and an 11.9% for μc-Si:H were observed in the solar cells on the nanotextured back reflectors, with little reduction in fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (Voc). Due to the increase of the Jsc by the improved light absorption at the long wavelengths, the conversion efficiency (η) of the a-Si:H and μc-Si:H solar cells increased from 5.59% to 7.60% and from 4.31% to 4.64%, respectively.

Abstract: We present a camera-based technique for the local determination of reverse saturation current densities J0 of highly doped regions in silicon wafers utilizing photoconductance calibrated photoluminescence imaging (PC-PLI). We apply this approach to 12.5×12.5cm² float zone silicon samples with textured surfaces and a homogeneous phosphorous diffusion with sheet resistances between 24 and 230Ω/□. We find enhanced photoluminescence emission at metallized regions of a sample due to reflection of long-wavelength light at the rear side of the sample. Our measurement setup comprises an optical short pass filter in front of the camera effectively blocking wavelengths above 970nm and therefore ensuring a correct calibration of the PL signal in terms of excess charge carrier density Δn. We analyze two sets of samples comprising metal contacts to highly doped regions prepared by Laser Transfer Doping (LTD) as well as standard tube furnace phosphorus diffusion. We find a considerably smaller J0 value of 370fA/cm² for the LTD approach compared to a standard diffusion process resulting in J0=570fA/cm². On the basis of these results we demonstrate that J0 imaging is a powerful analysis technique for process optimization.

Abstract: We have investigated the effect of boron (B) and phosphorus (P) compensation on the performance of Czochralski (CZ) silicon solar cells. Both majority and minority carrier mobilities are significantly reduced by the dopant compensation. Correspondingly, the minority carrier diffusion length becomes smaller. The compensated silicon solar cells show weaker spectral responses and therefore lower short-circuit current. However, the open-circuit voltage can be influenced by the net doping concentration in our silicon wafers. A higher open-circuit voltage could be obtained from the compensated solar cells due to its larger net doping concentration. As a result, the compensated solar cells could have the same efficiency as the conventional ones. It suggests that the dopant compensation in silicon with a doping level of ≤1017cm−3 is not a serious issue for the improvement of solar cell efficiency. The results are of significance for the upgraded metallurgical grade silicon (UMG-Si) application in the fabrication of high efficiency and low-cost solar cells.

LRP6 mediates Wnt/β-catenin signaling and regulates adipogenic differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells,

Abstract: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) are subjected to the control of several signal transduction pathways during regeneration processes, whereby Wnt/β-catenin signaling is of pivotal importance. Since there exists only fragmentary knowledge concerning the molecular function of the Wnt-coreceptors LRP5 and LRP6 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) in hMSC, we studied their impact on Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction by RNA interference. For monitoring changes in β-catenin-dependent transcription in a highly sensitive and specific manner, hMSC were stably transfected with a TCF/LEF reporter gene plasmid. In the presence of the activator Wnt3a, knockdown of LRP6 led to a strong decreased Wnt/β-catenin signaling, while RNAi against LRP5 exhibited no effect in this setting. In a reverse approach, ectopic expression of LRP6 resulted in a strong enhancement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, whereas overexpression of LRP5 exhibited no increased signaling capacity. Furthermore, only the ectopic expression of LRP6 – but not that of LRP5 – was able to restore Wnt3a-mediated β-catenin signaling after knockdown of endogenously expressed LRP6. These results demonstrate LRP6 as the predominant Wnt3a LRP-receptor in hMSC, which cannot be substituted by LRP5. In addition, we observed enhanced differentiation toward the adipogenic lineage after RNAi against LRP6 which was associated with the induction of PPAR-γ and fat vacuole formation. Thus, LRP6 is not only indispensable for Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling, but also for the suppression of differentiation of hMSC into the adipogenic lineage. Based on these observations, LRP6 may represent an attractive drug target for manipulating hMSC in cell and tissue regeneration approaches.

Abstract: The application of phase change materials (PCMs) for solar thermal-energy storage has received considerable attention in recent years due to their high storage density. A series of microencapsulated PCMs (micro-PCMs) with good phase change behavior have been synthesized through in-situ polymerization and the applications of the obtained micro-PCMs in thermal regulation of gypsum boards are presented in this study. Scanning electron microscope images reveal that the micro-PCMs were dispersed homogeneously in the gypsum boards. Differential scanning calorimeter results show that all the gypsum boards with different weight percentages of the micro-PCMs possess good phase change behavior. The melting and freezing temperatures as well as the latent heat of the gypsum board with 50wt% or 60wt% micro-PCMs and 3wt% glass fibers are quite suitable for the potential thermal energy storage of building applications. Thermal cycling tests indicate that the gypsum board with micro-PCMs maintains excellent thermal reliability after 60 melting–freezing cycles. Furthermore, the gypsum boards with micro-PCMs show a good thermal-regulated property. The temperature of the board incorporated with 60wt% micro-PCMs can be kept in the rage of 22–27°C for about 1735s due to the phase change of the inside micro-PCMs. In addition, the thermal-regulated gypsum boards achieve good thermal stability, high thermal capacity and thermal conductivity, especially for the sample incorporated with 50wt% micro-PCMs. From the above results, it can be concluded that the gypsum boards incorporated with 50wt% micro-PCMs have a good potential for thermal energy storage purpose in buildings.

Abstract: Parent or unsubstituted polythiophene (PT) films electrodeposited on hole-extraction-layer-coated ITO electrodes were used as the donor material in bilayer organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The electrodeposited PT layers had a porous surface with numerous voids and hollows of nanometer dimensions. The acceptor, [6], [6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), was deposited on the PT layer by spin-coating from chlorobenzene solutions. Cross-sectional STEM-EDS (scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analysis revealed that some of the PCBM molecules infiltrated into the PT layer to form a PT/PCBM interpenetrating layer 8–9nm thick between homogeneous PT and PCBM layers. The PT-based OPV devices fabricated with an optimal PT layer thickness (20nm) showed a power conversion efficiency of 1.5% under AM 1.5G (100mW/cm2) illumination, which is higher than that of previously reported OPV devices using electrodeposited polythiophenes in the active layer.

Abstract: The members of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) family are molecular chaperones that play major roles in development, stress responses, and diseases, and have been envisioned as targets for therapy, particularly in cancer. The molecular mechanisms that regulate their transcription, in normal, stress, or pathological conditions, are characterized by extreme complexity and subtlety. Although historically linked to the heat shock transcription factors (HSFs), the stress-induced or developmental expression of the diverse members, including HSPB1/Hsp27/Hsp25, αA-crystallin/HSPB4, and αB-crystallin/HSPB5, relies on the combinatory effects of many transcription factors. Coupled with remarkably different cis-element architectures in the sHsp regulatory regions, they confer to each member its developmental expression or stress-inducibility. For example, multiple regulatory pathways coordinate the spatio-temporal expression of mouse αA-, αB-crystallin, and Hsp25 genes during lens development, through the action of master genes, like the large Maf family proteins and Pax6, but also HSF4. The inducibility of Hsp27 and αB-crystallin transcription by various stresses is exerted by HSF-dependent mechanisms, by which concomitant induction of Hsp27 and αB-crystallin expression is observed. In contrast, HSF-independent pathways can lead to αB-crystallin expression, but not to Hsp27 induction. Not surprisingly, deregulation of the expression of sHSP is associated with various pathologies, including cancer, neurodegenerative, or cardiac diseases. However, many questions remain to be addressed, and further elucidation of the developmental mechanisms of sHsp gene transcription might help to unravel the tissue- and stage-specific functions of this fascinating class of proteins, which might prove to be crucial for future therapeutic strategies. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Small HSPs in physiology and pathology.

Abstract: We demonstrate experimentally that an appropriate combination of the layer thicknesses in an inverted P3HT:PCBM cell leads to an optical interference such that the EQE amounts to 91% of IQE. We observe that reflectivity between layers is minimized in a wavelength range of more than 100nm. In that range the EQE closely matches the IQE. The role played by the optical interference in improving the performance of the fabricated solar cells is confirmed by EQE calculated numerically using a model based on the transfer matrix method. Additionally, we observed that a similar cell with an active material 1.7 times thicker exhibited a lower PCE. The poor photon harvesting in the later cell configuration is attributed to an EQE that amounts only to 72% of the IQE.

Abstract: Optical losses in a photovoltaic (PV) module consist of reflectance losses and parasitic absorptance losses in the front layers of the module. A method for quantifying the optical losses associated with the cover glass and encapsulant material of silicon wafer based PV modules is presented. The method involves measuring the spectral reflectance (R) and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a silicon wafer solar cell before and after encapsulation. The approach used is to first obtain the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the cell using R and EQE of the cell before encapsulation. Assuming that the IQE of the cell is not changed by the encapsulation process, the spectrally resolved parasitic absorptance loss (Apara.mod) associated with the cover glass and the encapsulant material is calculated with the aid of EQE and R measurements of the encapsulated cell. Using this method, the optical losses (at near normal incidence) of single-cell multicrystalline silicon wafer PV modules with two different ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulants (conventional and super-clear EVA) are investigated and compared. Compared to conventional EVA, the module encapsulated with super-clear EVA is found to have much lower Apara.mod at short wavelengths.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) progresses from an early stage, confined to prostate, to a more aggressive metastasized cancer related with loss of androgen responsiveness. Although, it has been recognized that PCa cells have unique metabolic features, their glycolytic profile in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent stages of disease is much less known. Hence, the main purpose of this study was to compare glucose metabolism in androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and androgen-nonresponsive (PC3) PCa cells. Cell culture medium was collected and differences in glucose consumption and, lactate and alanine production were measured using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR) spectra analysis. The mRNA and protein expression of glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT3), phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT4) were determined by real-time PCR and Western Blot, respectively. The obtained results demonstrate that androgen-responsive (LNCaP) and androgen-nonresponsive (PC3) cells consumed similar amounts of glucose, whereas PC3 cells present higher lactate production. This increase in lactate production was concomitant with higher levels of MCT4 protein, increased LDH activity and higher lactate/alanine ratio, also suggesting increased levels of oxidative stress in PC3 cells. However, protein levels of LDH, associated with lactate metabolism, and GLUT3, involved in glucose uptake, were decreased in PC3 comparatively with LNCaP. Androgen-responsive and nonresponsive PCa cells present distinct glycolytic metabolism profiles, which suggest that targeting LDH and MCT4 metabolic pathways may be an important step for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the different stages of PCa.

Abstract: Surface plasmon enhancement effect is investigated in InAs/GaAs quantum dots solar cell. A nontrivial enhancement was observed in the photocurrent, quantum efficiency, and the spectral response of the solar cell. The surface plasmon was generated in gold or silver nanoparticles synthesized by a chemical reduction method. The coupling of the metallic nanoparticles to the surface of the solar cell was achieved by utilizing dithiol ligands in conjunction with thermal annealing process. The enhancement was observed in the entire spectral range covered by the solar cell (visible and near infrared spectral regions). This enhancement is attributed to photon scattering and trapping by the surface plasmon generated in the metallic nanoparticles.

Abstract: In this work we present a facile route to an efficient experimental screening of new materials and to a layer thickness optimization in solution processable polymer photovoltaic devices. Therefore, we developed a method of fabricating solar cells with wedge-shaped active layers. Spatially resolved measurements of the solar cell short circuit current densities for different light absorbing polymers under white light allow for a quick conclusion about the optimum active layer thickness within the device. To demonstrate the generality of this experimental approach we studied the well-established photoactive blends from poly-(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PC61BM) or poly[N-9′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCDTBT:PC71BM). The short circuit current densities are in very good agreement with optoelectronic device simulations and results from sample-by-sample measurements.

Abstract: Copolymer films consisting of (R)-(-)-3-(1-pyrrolyl)propyl-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)-α-phenylglycinate (DNBP) and 3,4-(ethylenedioxy)thiophene (EDOT) were electrochemically deposited onto ITO electrodes and their electrochromic properties were investigated. Besides high absorption in the near infrared region, these films presented multielectrochromism with three different colors, being brown in the reduced state, green in the neutral state, and blue in the oxidized state. Spectrochronoamperometry data revealed that the copolymer films have fast switching time, high chromatic contrast, and high stability to redox cycling. The films also displayed lower band gap and better electrochromic properties as compared to the homopolymer PDNBP.

Abstract: The morphology and self-organization control of the active layer in solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene): [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-buytyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) is studied by applying a non-solvent swelling treatment, where an acetonitrile solution is applied on top of the active layer for 10min, followed by a spin-coating process to remove the non-solvent. After non-solvent swelling treatment, the optical absorption spectra for the active layer films indicated a red shift with developing features of P3HT, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement data show the improvement of the effective interchain stacking of P3HT. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) results clearly show that the inter-diffusion region between the active layer and cathode is enhanced. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) data show increasing surface roughness, which would lead to increased collection of charges and thus improved efficiency. When the non-solvent swelling method was combined with the post thermal annealing treatment, synergistic effects for the enhancement of power conversion efficiency were observed: post-thermal annealing only: 2.64%, non-solvent treatment only: 1.58%, non-solvent treatment and post-thermal annealing: 3.01% efficiency.

Abstract: There is evidence indicating that bile acid is a promoter of colorectal cancer. Deoxycholic acid modifies apoptosis and proliferation by affecting intracellular signaling and gene expression. We are interested in revealing the relationship between deregulated miRNAs and deoxycholic acid in colorectal cancer development. We found that miR-199a-5p was expressed at a low level in human primary colonic epithelial cells treated with deoxycholic acid compared with control, and miR-199a-5p was significantly down-regulated in colorectal cancer tissues. The miR-199a-5p expression in colorectal cancer cells led to the suppression of tumor cell growth, migration and invasion. We further identified CAC1, a cell cycle-related protein expressed in colorectal cancer, as a miR-199a-5p target. We demonstrated that CAC1 is over-expressed in malignant tumors, and cellular CAC1 depletion resulted in cancer growth suppression. HCT-8 cells transfected with a miR-199a-5p mimic or inhibitor had a decrease or increase in CAC1 protein levels, respectively. The results of the luciferase reporter gene analysis demonstrated that CAC1 was a direct miR-199a-5p target. The high miR-199a-5p expression and low CAC1 protein expression reverse the tumor cell drug resistance. We conclude that miR-199a-5p can regulate CAC1 and function as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer. Therefore, the potential roles of deoxycholic acid in carcinogenesis are to decrease miR-199a-5p expression and/or increase the expression of CAC1, which contributes to tumorigenesis in patients with CRC. These findings suggest that miR-199a-5p is a useful therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.

Abstract: We have investigated the influence of the compensation level on the performance of p-type crystalline silicon solar cells by combining theoretical calculations and experiments. With the compensation level increasing, the fraction of ionized boron (B) atoms increases. The hole mobility is significantly reduced due to the increased ionized impurities scattering, while the electron mobility almost keeps constant due to the inverse contributions of ionized impurities scattering and electron–hole scattering. The carrier lifetime in compensated silicon, mainly dominated by high concentration of dopants, could get improved. Correspondingly, the minority carrier diffusion length increases, causing a higher short-circuit current. However, the open-circuit voltage first decreases and then increases with the increase of the compensation level, owing to the competition effect of the reduced net doping concentration and the increased excess carrier concentration. All these factors could finally result in a higher efficiency solar cell. These results suggest that intentional dopant compensation might be utilized for the improvement of solar cell efficiency, which is especially interesting for those based on highly-doped silicon feedstock.

Abstract: We have analyzed by means of electrical transport measurements, the insulator to metallic transition due to intermediate band (IB) formation (insulator to metallic-IB) in silicon layers. The samples were implanted with titanium concentrations well above the solid solubility limit and subsequently pulsed laser melted (PLM). Whereas the doping of silicon with Ti impurity concentrations below the Mott limit is known to produce deep levels which act as non radiative recombination centers, the introduction of a high concentration of deep impurities above this limit could form an IB. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) measurements show the remaining titanium concentration profile after PLM, indicating whether this concentration is above or below the theoretical limit for IB formation in the different implanted samples. Sheet resistance and Hall effect measurements performed in the temperature range (100–300K) show that insulator to metallic-IB transition takes place for concentrations above ∼1020cm−3. This transition becomes apparent in a rectifying behavior observed in van der Pauw and transversal I–V electrical measurements at low temperatures. Contacts exhibit Schottky or ohmic behavior for samples with Ti concentrations below or above the transition, respectively. All these results point out to the metallic behavior of the IB and provide a powerful tool to determine the IB formation in a semiconductor.

Abstract: Epac, exchange protein activated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), could regulate the trans-differentiation between adipogenesis and osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Epac activated by 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, a cAMP analog preferentially activating Epac, resulted in the increase of adipogenic gene expression and the decrease of osteogenic gene expression. The pro-adipogenic and anti-osteogenic effect of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was attributed to that 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP led to the activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) as well as the inhibition of Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) activities. Inhibition of Epac by a dominant-negative form of Epac1 resulted in the decrease of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), PKB and CREB activities as well as down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) expression. Inhibition of PI3K by a specific inhibitor or inhibition of Arf and Rho GAP adapter protein 3 (ARAP3, a phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)(3,4,5)P3 binding protein) by ARAP3 siRNA led to the recovery of RhoA and FAK activities. RhoA-V14, a constitutively active form of RhoA, could activate the MEK/ERK/Runx2 signaling. Therefore, we conclude that PI3K activated by Epac leads to the activation of PKB/CREB signaling and the up-regulation of PPARγ expression, which in turn activate the transcription of adipogenic genes; whereas osteogenesis is driven by Rho/FAK/MEK/ERK/Runx2 signaling, which can be inhibited by Epac via PI3K. These results should be helpful to provide new targets for treatment of osteoporosis and related bone-wasting diseases.

Abstract: We investigated the effect of the amount of phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) on anthracene-containing poly(p-phenylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly(p-phenylene-vinylene) (PPE–PPV) polymer (AnE-PVstat) solar cells. The efficiencies and fill factors of the polymer solar cells improved with increasing PCBM content. The highest efficiency obtained was 2.13% for AnE-PVstat:PCBM solar cells with 75% PCBM content. The increased efficiency for that PCBM content can be attributed to a change in the thin film nanostructure. The normalized efficiency values versus time plot from ISOS-L-1 test indicated that the AnE-PVstat:PCBM solar cell with 1:2 blend ratio showed 100% durability; for 1:3 and 1:4 ratios it showed with approximately 96% durability under standard solar irradiation of 100mW/cm2 (AM1.5G) at ambient conditions for 21h. ISOS-D-3 Damp test indicated that the normalized jsc and normalized efficiency versus time graphs showed similar behaviors; the AnE-PVstat:PCBM solar cell with 1:4 ratio has 99% durability for 40h in a weathering chamber.

Abstract: We developed a simple and effective method for the large scale formation of self-assembled Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) nanocrystals by ion beam irradiation. The compositional changes and morphological evolution were observed as a function of the irradiation time. As the ion irradiation time increased, the nano-dots were transformed into a nano-ridge structure due to the competition between sputtering and diffusion processes during irradiation. In terms of the stoichiometry of the CIGS nano-dots, an increase in the Cu content was observed while the Se content decreased. The PL peak of the nano-dots formed CIGS thin film exhibited a blue-shift. Uniformly formed crystalline CIGS nano-dots can be adopted to increase the p–n junction area and the size confinement effect between the CdS and CIGS film in solar cell systems. This simple method can be exploited for band-gap engineering and enhancing photovoltaic properties.

Abstract: We investigate the film stresses that develop in the polymer films and metal electrodes of poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells. A compressive biaxial stress of ∼−36MPa was measured in PEDOT:PSS while a tensile stress of ∼6MPa was measured in the BHJ layer. We then analyze the effect of electrode deposition rate on the film stresses in the Al electrode. Compressive stresses of ∼−100 to −145MPa in the Al electrode lead to a buckling instability resulting in undulating electrode surface topography. The BHJ layer was found to have the lowest cohesion (∼1.5–1.8J/m2) among the layers of the solar cell and dependent on the Al electrode deposition rate. The cohesive failure path in the BHJ layer exhibited the same periodicity and orientation of the Al electrode buckling topography. We discuss the implications of the film stresses on damage processes during device fabrication and operation.

Abstract: Electrochromic switchable mirrors are expected to be used in energy-saving windows because their optical properties can be changed by application of a voltage. For practical use, the negative impact of environmental conditions on the optical switching properties of the device should be minimized. In this work, the durability of an electrochromic device was investigated in a thermostat/humidistat chamber at −5°C. After devices were stored at sub-zero temperatures, the switching speed and maximum transmittance decreased only slightly with increasing exposure time. In other words, degradation of the device did not significantly occur at sub-zero temperatures. In comparison, the optical switching properties of a device stored at 40°C and 60% relative humidity severely deteriorated. This deterioration was attributed to the degradation of the surface of the Mg4Ni optical switching layer. This layer was affected by the environmental conditions, and in particular changed from the metallic magnesium state to a non-metallic state. In future work, we will investigate suitable measures for preventing environmental damage to the device.

Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the preparation of point contact openings in surface passivated macroporous silicon layers. In our experiments we control the etching parameters to vary the percentage of these non-passivated local openings from 0% to 1.6%. We investigate the impact of these local openings in the passivating layer on the effective carrier lifetime. These local openings reduce the measured effective carrier lifetime with increasing percentage of the non-passivated areas. We measure effective carrier lifetimes up to 10μs on 29μm-thick fully passivated macroporous silicon samples. We develop and apply a 3-dimensional numerical model to calculate carrier lifetimes as a function of pore morphology, surface recombination, percentage of non-passivated area, and bulk lifetime. The model agrees with the experimental measurements. We find a surface recombination velocity of (Spass=22.8−1.4+1.6)cms−1 for the passivated surfaces and Snp=(2200−1400+1500)cms−1 for the non-passivated surface.

Abstract: Carrier mobility in silicon plays a crucial role for photovoltaic applications. While the influence of doping on mobility in standard monocrystalline silicon is well understood, recent research has been focused on the effects of crystal defects in multicrystalline (mc) silicon and of the presence of both acceptors and donors in compensated silicon, both introducing additional scattering centers influencing carrier mobility. In this work measurements of the majority carrier mobility have been carried out in two blocks of compensated multicrystalline silicon. Confirming existing results we come to the conclusion that with increasing compensation level mobilities may be significantly lower than predicted by Klaassen's mobility model, which is basically suited for the description of mobilities in compensated silicon as it accounts for scattering on both acceptors and donors. However, as this model is based on mobility data from uncompensated silicon, a compensation-related reduction of screening is not taken into account sufficiently. To describe mobilities in compensated silicon, a modification of Klaassen's mobility model based on published mobility data in compensated silicon is suggested.

Abstract: A new accepter unit, phenanthro[9,10-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, was synthesized and utilized for the syntheses of the conjugated polymers containing electron donor–acceptor pairs for OPV devices in order to describe the effect of changing the coupling position with cyclopentadithiophene unit. This novel phenanthro[9,10-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole unit with a phenanthene group possesses an electron deficient thiadiazole group and can promote planarity of the compound. The solid films of PCPDTPTm with meta linkage and PCPDTPTp with para linkage show absorption bands with maximum peaks at about 460 and 484nm and the absorption onsets at 558 and 579nm, corresponding to band gaps of 2.22 and 2.14eV, respectively. The absorption spectrum of the PCPDTPTp was red shifted as compared to that of PCPDTPTm, which reveals that PCPDTPTp has longer conjugated length caused by the coupling position. The electron density of the PCPDTPTm HOMO is distributed not only on the donor moiety but also on the thiadiazole moiety to generate intermolecular charge transfer from cyclopentadithiophene unit to phenanthrothiadiazole unit. The device with PCPDTPTm:PC71BM with TiOx layer showed VOC value of 0.97V, JSC value of 5.50mA/cm2, and FF of 0.33, giving power conversion efficiency of 1.80%.

Abstract: During processing of CdTe solar cells, sodium can diffuse from the glass substrate into the active layers and can considerably affect CdTe solar cell properties. In this paper, the effects of sodium on structural and photovoltaic properties of low temperature grown CdTe solar cells are investigated in detail. Presence of sodium during the CdCl2 treatment enhances CdTe grain growth and causes widening of grain boundaries, creating pinholes and possible shunt paths in the solar cell. Furthermore, even small concentrations of sodium strongly enhance CdS–CdTe intermixing and a recrystallization leading to CdS island formation, which results in direct contacts between absorber and transparent front contact. Due to sodium present during the CdCl2 treatment the space charge region width strongly decreased, indicating the possibility of increasing acceptor density in CdTe. In spite of the doping effect, cells, which were CdCl2-treated in the presence of sodium, showed deterioration of photovoltaic performance due to excessive CdS–CdTe intermixing and electrical shunting. A sufficiently thick and large grained TCO layer of ZnO:Al can effectively suppress sodium diffusion in low temperature grown CdTe solar cells on soda-lime glass preventing the deterioration of solar cell properties due to sodium. This enabled the growth of 13.5% efficiency (VOC=853mV, FF=74.4%, JSC=21.3mAcm−2, without anti-reflection coating) CdTe solar cells on low cost soda-lime glass without additional diffusion barrier layer in spite of large sodium content of the substrate.

Abstract: Two D–A type conjugated polymers bearing 3,4-dithiophenyl-1,2-squaraine as acceptor segment, thiophene and benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as donor moieties, namely, PTTST and PBDTTST, are synthesized by Stille coupling reaction. Compared with their reference polymer PBDTTT without 1,2-squaraine unit, both PTTST and PBDTTST possess more extended absorption in the vis–NIR region of 600–800nm and lowered HOMO energy levels of 0.1–0.2eV. Bulk-heterojunction PSC with PBDTTST as p-type material shows high performance with the best PCE value of 1.26% (Voc=0.87V, Jsc=3.81mA/cm2, FF=0.38) under irradiation of 100mW/cm2, while that of PBDTTT-based PSC is 0.36%. Therefore, 1,2-squaraine is a promising electron-acceptor component for construction of high performance photovoltaic D–A type conjugated photovoltaic polymers.

Abstract: In this work, we present an all-water-solution processed polymer/nanocrystals (NCs) hybrid solar cell (HSC) with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture with donor material poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV) and acceptor material anatase TiO2 NCs. After spin-coating a water solution containing PPV precursor and TiO2 NCs, the active layer is achieved after a simple annealing process. The influences of PPV:TiO2 and their morphology on the photovoltaic performance of HSCs were investigated. By changing the ratio of PPV to TiO2, the morphology of the active layer can be controlled and the photovoltaic performance of polymer/NCs hybrid solar can be improved. The hybrid solar cells with a PPV:TiO2 blend ratio 1:3 present the best performance with the PCE of 0.11%. This work provides an alternative way to fabricate environmentally friendly, low cost, and high throughout polymer solar cells by using water as the processing solvent.

Abstract: The stress responses of most bacteria are thought to involve the upregulation of small heat shock proteins. We describe here some of the most pertinent aspects of small heat shock proteins, to highlight their potential for use in various applications. Bacterial species have between one and 13 genes encoding small heat shock proteins, the precise number depending on the species considered. Major efforts have recently been made to characterize the protein protection and membrane stabilization mechanisms involving small heat shock proteins in bacteria. These proteins seem to be involved in the acquisition of cellular heat tolerance. They could therefore potentially be used to maintain cell viability under unfavorable conditions, such as heat shock or chemical treatments. This review highlights the potential roles of applications of small heat shock proteins in stabilizing overproduced heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli, purified bacterial small heat shock proteins in protein biochip technology, proteomic analysis and food technology and the potential impact of these proteins on some diseases. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Small HSPs in physiology and pathology.

Abstract: During the fermentation process, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells are often inhibited by the accumulated ethanol, and the mechanism of the S. cerevisiae response to ethanol is not fully understood. In the current study, a systematic analytical approach was used to investigate the changes in the S. cerevisiae cell metabolome that were elicited by treatment with various concentrations of ethanol. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and a multivariate analysis were employed to investigate the ethanol-associated intracellular biochemical changes in S. cerevisiae. The intracellular metabolite profiles that were found upon treatment of the cells with different concentrations of ethanol were unique and could be distinguished with the aid of principal component analysis. Furthermore, partial least-squares-discriminant analysis revealed a group classification and pairwise discrimination between the control without ethanol and ethanol treated groups, and 29 differential metabolites with variable importance in the projection value greater than 1 were identified, which was also confirmed by the subsequent hierarchical cluster analysis. The metabolic relevance of these compounds in the response of S. cerevisiae to ethanol stress was investigated. Under ethanol stress, the glycolysis was inhibited and the use of carbon sources for fermentation was diminished, which might account for the growth inhibition of S. cerevisiae cells. It was suggested that S. cerevisiae cells change the levels of fatty acids, e.g., hexadecanoic, octadecanoic and palmitelaidic acids, to maintain the integrity of their plasma membrane through decreasing membrane fluidity in the medium containing ethanol. Moreover, the increased levels of some amino acids idemtified in the cells of ethanol-treated experimental group might also confer ethanol tolerance to S. cerevisiae. These results reveal that the metabolomics strategy is a powerful tool to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of a microorganism's cellular response to environmental stress factors.

Abstract: The 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs) are IFN-induced antiviral proteins and are upregulated by infection of viral and some bacterial pathogens. There are at least 2 transcripts of approximately 1.8 and 2.0kb in interferon-beta treated samples that are recognized by a probe for human OASL in Northern blot assay. By RT-PCR amplification we have isolated a previously undescribed splice variant of human OASL, named OASL d. The new variant was derived from deletion of exons 4 and 5 and encodes a protein of 384aa residues that shares the N-terminal 219aa residues with OASL a. Sequence analysis indicates that OASL d also contains the entire ubiquitin-like domain identified in human OASL a. OASL d was strongly induced by IFNγ in THP-1 monocytic cells and in A549 epithelial cells by interferon-beta as detected by immunoblotting assay. Ectopic expression of OASL a or OASL d, but not OASL b that shares the N-terminus with OASL a and d, partially inhibited EV71 and VSV infection. No effect against HSV-2 infection was observed. Therefore, OASL d is a novel isoform of human OASL that possesses antiviral activity against RNA viruses.

Abstract: Our previous studies demonstrated that acetylated tubulin forms a complex with Na+,K+-ATPase and thereby inhibits its enzyme activity in cultured COS and CAD cells. The enzyme activity was restored by treatment of cells with l-glutamate, which caused dissociation of the acetylated tubulin/Na+,K+-ATPase complex. Addition of glucose, but not elimination of glutamate, led to re-formation of the complex and inhibition of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism underlying this effect of glucose. We found that exposure of cells to high glucose concentrations induced: (a) microtubule formation; (b) activation of aldose reductase by the microtubules; (c) association of tubulin with membrane; (d) formation of the acetylated tubulin/Na+,K+-ATPase complex and consequent inhibition of enzyme activity. Exposure of cells to sorbitol caused similar effects. Studies on erythrocytes from diabetic patients and on tissues containing insulin-insensitive glucose transporters gave similar results. Na+,K+-ATPase activity was >50% lower and membrane-associated tubulin content was >200% higher in erythrocyte membranes from diabetic patients as compared with normal subjects. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that acetylated tubulin was a constituent of a complex with Na+,K+-ATPase in erythrocyte membranes from diabetic patients. Based on these findings, we propose a mechanism whereby glucose triggers a synergistic effect of tubulin and sorbitol, leading to activation of aldose reductase, microtubule formation, and consequent Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition.

Abstract: Although initially somewhat ignored, recent studies have now clearly established that the diverse members of the human family of small HSPs (HSPB1–HSPB10) play crucial roles in a wide range of cell types to maintain the integrity and function of tissues, in particular that of nervous and muscular tissue. The 10 human HSPBs clearly have overlapping and non-overlapping functional characteristics. Their ability to self- and hetero-oligomerise provides the cells with a large array of potentially different, specific functions. Single HSPB members can have a multitude of functions (moonlighting) and act on different “clients”, thus affecting a wide range of different processes or structures that can ultimately affect the rate of aging of tissues and entire organisms. This is underscored by the findings that some inherited diseases involve mutations in several HSPB members that cause premature (mostly muscle and neuronal) tissue degeneration. Inversely, cancer cell resistance to different anticancer therapies is associated with elevated expression of several HSPBs. Still, many unanswered questions exist about the precise functioning of HSPBs, their collaboration with other HSPB members as well as their functions within the entire cellular chaperone network. Also, better insight in the regulation of expression of the various members and how their function is modulated post-translationally is needed. Such may be crucially important to develop means to intervene with their function for therapeutic purposes, which would require functional down-regulation in cancer but up-regulation in, for instance, cardiac or degenerative neuro/neuromuscular diseases.

Abstract: The dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-like protein 10 (DPP10) is a type II transmembrane protein homologue to the serine protease DPPIV/CD26 but enzymatically inactive. In the mammalian brain, DPP10 forms a complex with voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv4 family, regulating their cell surface expression and biophysical properties. DPP10 is a glycoprotein containing eight predicted N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain. In this study we investigated the role of N-glycosylation on DPP10 trafficking and functional activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis (N to Q) we showed that N-glycosylation occured at six positions. Glycosylation at these specific residues was necessary for DPP10 trafficking to the plasma membrane as observed by flow cytometry. The surface expression levels of the substitutions N90Q, N119Q, N257Q and N342Q were reduced by more than 60%. Hence the interaction with the Kv4.3/KChIP2a channel complex was disrupted preventing the hastening effect of wild type DPP10 on current kinetics. Interestingly, N257 was crucial for this function and its substitution to glutamine completely blocked DPP10 sorting to the cell surface and prevented DPP10 dimerization. In summary, we demonstrated that glycosylation was necessary for both DPP10 trafficking to the cell surface and functional interaction with Kv4 channels.

Abstract: Thin-film, polycrystalline, CIGS solar cells with localized and whole back contacts were modeled and simulated in two dimensions (2D) in order to investigate their potential for achieving high performance. The simulation results show that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the CIGS cells with localized back contacts increases with a decreasing contacted area due to the decreased cumulative surface recombination rate at the back side of the CIGS layer. The conversion efficiency (η) of these thin-film, CIGS cells can be increased by 15% relatively compared to CIGS cells with traditional whole back contacts if the surface-recombination velocity of the electrons and the holes (sn/p) between two adjacent fingers of the back contact is zero and the density of the acceptor defect states (NtA) inside the CIGS layer is low (NtA<1013cm−3). The polycrystalline properties of the CIGS were modeled by setting vertical grain boundaries (GBs) within the CIGS absorbent layer. The simulation results show that a valence-band offset (VBO) above 0.2eV at the GBs increases the Jsc, but it also significantly reduces the fill factor (FF) of the CIGS cells with localized back contacts. The results show that the efficiency of the CIGS cells with localized back contacts can be increased by 7% relatively if the density of the acceptor defect states at the GBs (NtA,GB) equals 1017cm−3. In contrast, the efficiency of the CIGS cells with localized back contacts can be increased by only 1% relatively at the same NtA,GB if the VBO is 0.5eV.

Abstract: A series of conjugated polymers were designed and synthesized via the alternating copolymerization of the electron-donating monomer 2,7-carbazole and electron-accepting monomers of naphthalene diimide (NDI), dithienyl-naphthalene diimide (DTNDI), perylene diimide (PDI) and dithienyl-perylene diimide (DTPDI), respectively. The obtained four copolymers showed good thermal stability as well as broad absorptions in visible region and narrow optical band gaps (1.86–1.59eV). Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) measuremnts, it was found that all copolymers were n-type semiconductive materials. The copolymers' photovoltaic properties were evaluated when the blends of poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) and copolymers were used as the active layers of polymer solar cells (PSCs): among four copolymers, the copolymer alternating 2,7-carbazole and DTPDI units (PCDTPDI) exhibited the best photovoltaic performance with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.48V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 3.40mA/cm2, fill factor (FF) of 0.42, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.68%.

Abstract: Etoposide-induced gene 24 (Ei24) is a p53 target gene that inhibits growth, induces apoptosis and autophagy, as well as suppresses breast cancer. To evaluate the role of Ei24 in in vivo tumorigenesis, we generated an Ei24-deficient mouse model. Here, we report that, although Ei24 homozygous knockout mice are embryonic lethal, Ei24 heterozygous null mice are attenuated to DMBA/TPA-induced carcinogenesis with regard to the number and size of tumors but not the incidence. Ei24 contains a functional consensus motif, named as an R motif that is highly analogous to amino acids 105–110 of RINCK1, an E3 ligase for protein kinase C (PKC) proteins. We found that Ei24 stabilizes PKCα via RINCK degradation and competition with RINCK for binding with the C1a domain of PKCα. We also found that Ei24 contributes to PKCα-mediated transactivation of EGFR by promoting PKCα membrane localization and interaction with EGFR. Finally, using Oncomine database we show that Ei24 and EGFR are upregulated in some subsets of human HNSCC. These results suggest that Ei24 is a regulator of the RINCK1-PKCα-EGFR signaling pathway in the development of skin-cancer.

Abstract: Owing to the redox reversibility and color-tunable property, Prussian blue (PB) and its analogs (PBAs) have been of interest in the field of electrochromics. However, most PBAs have long lacked an effective method for processing them as uniform and robust thin films on transparent conductive substrates, so the applications of most PBAs for electrochromic windows are not yet realized. Here we propose a composite film approach to tackle this bottleneck. We employ poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) ink as a dispersive medium for spin coating of PBA nanoparticles on indium tin oxide (ITO) glasses. Two kinds of PBAs, highly transparent zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) and electrochromically active cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF) nanoparticles, are prepared and used to prove this idea. From SEM pictures, we find that a uniform nano-ZnHCF film up to 1.76μm in coating thickness can be deposited on the ITO slide, and the morphology of cuboid-shape ZnHCF nanoparticles (200–500nm) is highly dependent on the co-precipitation concentration. Enhanced charge capacity, cycle life and diffusion characteristics for nano-ZnHCF through networking with PEDOT:PSS are demonstrated with cyclic voltammetric (CV) analyses. According to the AC impedance characterization by a new Randles circuit model, it is found that PEDOT:PSS not only serves as a transparent conductive binder for nano-ZnHCF but also acts like a pseudo-capacitor that holds electric charge for facile electron transfer between the nanoparticles. To demonstrate practical devices, a 10×10cm2 WO3 window prototype with a maximum transmittance modulation of 61.6% at 700nm and a polymeric red-green-blue (RGB) device prototype with a low driving voltage of 1.6V are successfully fabricated with the nano-ZnHCF/PEDOT:PSS counterelectrode. The PEDOT:PSS-assisted spin coating also attains a reliable nano-CoHCF thin film that shows vivid red-to-green electrochromism and has an AC impedance feature perfectly explained by the new Randles circuit. To sum up, we believe that the PEDOT:PSS-assisted spin coating can be applied to other nano-PBAs and may help realize the PBA-based electrochromic windows.

Abstract: Damaged DNA-binding protein 2 (DDB2), a protein that binds damaged DNA, is a DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor. This study is the first to demonstrate that DDB2 is a novel androgen receptor (AR)-interacting protein; and mediating contact with AR and CUL4A–DDB1 complex for AR ubiquitination/degradation. DNA damage induces both p53 and DDB2 gene expression those two can inhibit AR expression. The former reduces AR via transcription regulation but the latter via proteosome degradation. Thereby DDB2 can inhibit cell growth rate in AR-expressing cells (LNCaP) but not in AR-null cells (PC3). Hence DDB2 may be a potential regimen for prostate cancer treatment, especially in androgen-refractory patients harboring high amount of AR who cannot be cured by androgen ablation.

Abstract: The mineralization of a synthetic wastewater containing apple juice using a homogeneous solar photo-Fenton oxidation process assisted with ferrioxalate was evaluated as an alternative to or a rapid pretreatment step for conventional anaerobic digestion and can also be used if the water to be treated contains a recalcitrant pollutant. Experimental kinetic constants were fitted using neural networks (NNs) with an 86% confidence level. The effect of the different variables was explained on the basis of the kinetic mechanism. At the selected operating conditions ([H2O2]=6000ppm, [Fe(II)]=40ppm, pH=2.7 and [(COOH)2]=40ppm), 97% mineralization was achieved in 67min when treating a synthetic wastewater with 700ppm of total organic carbon (TOC). In total, 6.5mol of H2O2 were consumed per each mole of total organic carbon removed from solution. The contributions of molecular, radical and photolytic pathways were also studied. The operational costs due to the consumption of electrical energy, reagents and catalysts were calculated. The results showed that the solar photo-Fenton system was economically feasible, able to achieve up to 97% mineralization with a total cost of 1.6cents €/g TOC removed (10.9€/m3 of treated water) at a pilot plant scale.

Abstract: The ability to alloy Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 with Ge provides a unique ability to band-gap engineer the absorber film by controlling the relative cation ratios. In here, a preliminary study on adjusting the Ge to Sn ratio is shown to significantly improve the device performance of CZTSSe thin film solar cells. CZTGeSSe solar cell with total area power conversion efficiency as high as 8.4% has been realized using a nanocrystal-based thin film deposition process. The selenized CZTGeSSe thin film exhibits a bi-layer structure where the thin sintered large-grain layer could be responsible for the poor red-response in external quantum efficiency of the resulting solar cell.

Abstract: This paper presents an acidic texturing and a novel vapor texturing method for Edge-defined Film-fed Growth (EFG) multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers. P-type EFG mc-Si wafers with resistivity 0.5–2Ωcm and thickness of 300±70μm were textured with acidic solution using HF:HNO3:CH3COOH. The reflectance decreased as the acid etching proceeded and then saturated when the etching depth reached 10μm. The isotropic etching of acid texturing resulted in minimum reflectance of 13%. For vapor texturing, the vapor particles were generated by adding silicon to HF:HNO3 acidic solution. Initially silicon was oxidized with HNO3 vapor particles. The nano-pore sized SiF62− ion formed over the EFG mc-Si wafer acted as a barrier on the Si surface. The HF vapor particles then dissolved the formed SiO2 effectively by passing through the nano-pores of SiF62− ion and etched the EFG mc-Si wafer. The anisotropic etching of vapor textured wafers resulted in an etching depth of about 2.78μm with reflectance of 5%. The EFG mc-Si solar cell fabricated with acid texturing had VOC of 592mV, JSC of 27.71mA/cm2 and efficiency of 12.85% while the cell with novel vapor texturing showed VOC of 597mV, JSC of 29.61mA/cm2 and efficiency of 13.54%.

Abstract: The influence of selenium background pressure during post-deposition annealing of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) is investigated. Solar cells made from samples post-annealed with selenium showed the same solar cell parameters as references without any annealing treatment. Dark JV measurements of microscopic devices with sizes of 10μm×10μm from the sample annealed with selenium showed good agreement with the corresponding macroscopic solar cells. Samples annealed without selenium showed degradation in terms of open circuit voltage and fill factor. Electron beam induced current (EBIC) imaging for these degraded solar cells revealed patches of reduced current. Microscopic JV measurements showed that the deterioration is not limited to these patches. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy analysis showed phase decomposition of the CIGS absorber in areas of the patches toward the back contact. We conclude that in addition to the local phase decomposition of the CIGS leading to patches in the EBIC image the anneal in vacuum without selenium background pressure also leads to other modifications of the CIGS layer influencing the interface region on a macroscopic scale.

Abstract: Na+/K+-ATPase targeted cancer therapy has attracted increasing interests of oncologists in lung cancer field. Although multiple anti-cancer mechanisms of cardiac glycosides as Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors are revealed, the role of autophagy and related molecular signaling pathway for the class of compounds in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells has not been systematically examined. We herein investigated the anti-cancer effects of two representative cardiac glycosides, digoxin and ouabain, in A549 and H460 cell lines. Both agents caused significant growth inhibition at nanomolar level. The cardiac glycosides were found to induce moderate G2/M arrest but not apoptosis at IC50 level in the NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, autophagy was markedly induced by both agents, as evidenced by the time- and dose-dependent increase of LC3-II, up-regulation of Atg5 and Beclin1, as well as by the observations through acridine orange staining, transmission electron microscopy and quantification of GFP-LC3 fluorescence. Importantly, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway was activated, resulting in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) deactivation during autophagy induction. Moreover, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation was simultaneously found to be involved in the autophagy regulation. Co-treatment with respective inhibitors or siRNAs could either block the autophagic phenotypes and signals, or significantly increase the cellular viability, indicating the drugs-induced autophagy plays tumor-suppressing role. This work provides first evidence showing that the cardiac glycosides induce autophagy in human NSCLC cells through regulation of both mTOR and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The autophagy may at least partially account for the growth inhibitory effects of the compounds in human NSCLC cells.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a poor prognosis and overall survival (os) compared to other types of breast cancer tumors. however, there is to date no evidence that this is also the case in saudi Arabia.
DESIGN AND SETTING
Retrospective review of breast cancer patients who were treated from January 2001 to December 2008 (517 patients) at the King AbdulAziz Medical City, riyadh, saudi Arabia.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients were selected as TNBC if all three markers of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and the human epidermal growth factor (HER2) tested by immunohistochemistry as negative. They were then age- and stage-matched, and compared with non-TNBC patients to examine differences, if any, in their clinicopathologic features, prognosis and OS.
RESULTS
Twenty-six patients with a follow up time of at least three years were identified as TNBC. Thirty-three patients who were age- and stage-matched were selected as the non-TnBC controls. Clinicopathologic results illustrated significantly more grade 3 tumors (P=.02) and CK 5/6 expression (P<.001) in the TNBC group compared to the non-TnBC group. TNBC patients aged ≤40years showed a significantly worse prognosis and os compared to TNBC patients aged >40years (P=.01), and when compared to the non-TnBC group (P=.04).
CONCLUSION
The incidence of TNBC in our cohort is similar to what has been illustrated in previous studies in Western population. There was no significant difference in 3-year survival between TNBC and non-TnBC groups. however, the aggressiveness of this type of tumor and os is significantly higher in younger patients aged <40years, compared to those over 40 years of age.

Abstract: The ternary Cu–Sb–S semiconductors are considered to be sustainable and potential alternative absorber materials in thin film photovoltaic applications. In these compounds, several phases may coexist, albeit in different proportions depending on experimental growth conditions. Additionally, the photovoltaic efficiency could be increased with isoelectronic doping. In this work we analyze the electronic properties of O-doped Cu3SbS3 in two structures: the wittichenite and the skinnerite. We use first-principles within the density functional formalism with two different exchange–correlation potentials. In addition, we estimate the potential of these compounds for photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: The electrochromic window (ECW) based on poly (3,3-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine), PProDOT-Me2, and V2O5–TiO2 coatings was fabricated for modulating optical transmittance. It exhibited the high contrast of optical transmittance change (ΔT %) to 68% at 580nm, rapid color-switching time, electrochemically cyclic stability and optical memory. Also, the large-sized ECW of 305×508mm2 was successfully fabricated. The Li+ insertion/extraction process of PProDOT-Me2 and V2O5–TiO2 films was monitored by cyclic voltammetry and the diffusion coefficient was calculated. The optical transmittance changes of the ECW were observed by applying potential steps. It demonstrated long-term electrochromic and electrochemical stability after over 150,000 cyclic switches. It was found that the response time of the ECW was rapid. It was five seconds for coloration and four seconds for bleaching in the ECW (25×25mm2). The optical memory was the great advantage of the ECW.

Abstract: In this paper lead-free silver ink for the front side metallization of silicon solar cells is investigated. Lead is replaced by bismuth. The etching of the silicon nitride anti-reflection coating and the crystallite formation is studied by varying the amount of bismuth oxide added to the ink. Bismuth oxide was either incorporated into the glass frit or added as a powder. The results are compared to our standard lead based standard ink. All inks were applied with aerosol jet printing. For characterization SEM imaging, contact resistance measurements, and the current–voltage-characteristics of the prepared solar cells are used. Concerning the solar cell efficiency, it is found that bismuth glass inks provide a similar efficiency in comparison to the lead based ink.

Abstract: Thin layers of lithium fluoride (LiF), together with aluminum, can be used as rear electrodes in high-efficiency amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells on rough substrates, as recently demonstrated by Fang et al. (IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices 58(9)(2011) 3048–3052). We employ numerical modeling to evaluate the optical losses and charge generation profiles in these thin film solar cells. We find that the increase in rear electrode reflectivity by inserting LiF, leading to increased photocurrent, is the dominant factor in device performance improvement, accounting for 7% gain in photocurrent. The simulations are in good agreement with measurements of pin a-Si:H solar cells with varied rear electrodes.

Abstract: Random Al back surface field (BSF) p-type Si solar cells are presented, where a stack of Al2O3 and SiNx is used as rear surface passivation layer containing blisters. It is shown that no additional contact opening step is needed, since during co-firing local Al BSFs are induced at the location of these blisters. The best fill factors and short circuit currents are obtained in the case of (i) a hydrophobic pre-passivation cleaning, since it leads to a small density of larger blisters, and (ii) 10nm of Al2O3, where the blistering size still increases during firing thanks to additional out-gassing. There is an apparent gain in Jsc and Voc of, respectively, 1.3mA/cm2 and 5mV for the best random Al BSF cells compared to full Al BSF reference cells, because of better rear internal reflection and rear surface passivation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
High altitude has an effect on blood count parameters, but low altitude (especially below sea level) has not been studied.
DESIGN AND SETTING
A cross-sectional study of aymptomatic subjects aged between 18 to 35 years of age who had reported to the blood bank at the King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH)/Irbid and Ministry of Health, Jordan, during the period between January 2010 to June 2011 for blood donation.
METHODS
Hematological values were compared in healthy adult blood donors living in areas 200 to 300 meters below sea level and areas 500 to 1500 meters above sea level. The study population consisted of 800 females and 666 males aged between 18 to 35 years.
RESULTS
The mean values for hemoglobin level, mean corpuscular volume and leukocyte counts were significantly higher in people living above sea level than in people living below sea level (P<.0001), whereas platelet count and red cell distribution width were significantly higher in people living below sea level than in people living above sea level (P<.0001).
CONCLUSION
We found a significant difference in hematological parameters in healthy adults living above and below sea level. The hematological values presented here are from a large, representative population sample and the first report of people living below sea level.

Abstract: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is involved in mesenchymal stem cell-stimulated tumor growth in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism by which mesenchymal stem cells promote tumorigenesis remains elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that conditioned medium from A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549 CM) induced the expression of ADAM12, a disintegrin and metalloproteases family member, in human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs). A549 CM-stimulated ADAM12 expression was abrogated by pretreatment of hASCs with the LPA receptor 1 inhibitor Ki16425 or by small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of LPA receptor 1, suggesting a key role for the LPA–LPA receptor 1 signaling axis in A549 CM-stimulated ADAM12 expression. Silencing of ADAM12 expression using small interfering RNA or short hairpin RNA abrogated LPA-induced expression of both α-smooth muscle actin, a marker of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, and ADAM12 in hASCs. Using a xenograft transplantation model of A549 cells, we demonstrated that silencing of ADAM12 inhibited the hASC-stimulated in vivo growth of A549 xenograft tumors and the differentiation of transplanted hASCs to α-smooth muscle actin-positive carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. LPA-conditioned medium from hASCs induced the adhesion of A549 cells and silencing of ADAM12 inhibited LPA-induced expression of extracellular matrix proteins, periostin and βig-h3, in hASCs and LPA-conditioned medium-stimulated adhesion of A549 cells. These results suggest a pivotal role for LPA-stimulated ADAM12 expression in tumor growth and the differentiation of hASCs to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts expressing α-smooth muscle actin, periostin, and βig-h3.

Abstract: The mechanisms involved in the continuous expression of constitutive genes are unclear. We hypothesize that steady state intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which their levels are tightly maintained, could be regulating the expression of these constitutive genes in resting cells. We analyzed the regulation of an important constitutive gene, TGF-β1, after decreasing intracellular ROS concentration in human mesangial cells. Decreased intracellular hydrogen peroxide by catalase addition reduced TGF-β1 protein, mRNA expression and promoter activity. Furthermore, catalase decreased the basal activity of Activated Protein-1 (AP-1) that regulates TGF-β1 promoter activity. This effect disappeared when AP-1 binding site was removed. Similar results were observed with another protein containing AP-1 binding sites in its promoter, such as eNOS, but it was not the case in other constitutive genes without any AP-1 binding site, as COX1 or PKG1. The pharmacological inhibition of the different ROS synthesis sources by blocking NADPH oxidase, the mitochondrial respiratory chain or xanthine oxidase, or the use of human fibroblasts with genetically deficient mitochondrial activity, induced a similar, significant reduction of steady state ROS concentration as the one observed with catalase. Moreover, there was decreased TGF-β1 expression in all the cases excepting the xanthine oxidase blockade. These findings suggest a novel role for the steady state intracellular ROS concentration, where the compartmentalized, different systems involved in the intracellular ROS production, could be essential for the expression of constitutive AP1-dependent genes, as TGF-β1.

Abstract: Antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) films with polycrystalline rutile structure and preferred orientation of (101) have been prepared from the ATO nanopowders sintered targets by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. Compared with the ATO targets made from SnO2 and Sb2O3 mixed powders, the ATO targets derived from direct ATO nanopowders are advanced in good homogeneity, precise control of doping ratio and highly densification, which provides an effective way to further improve the physical properties of the ATO films. The microstructure of the obtained ATO films is observed by SEM, and the electrical and optical properties of the ATO films are analyzed. The results suggest that for 10mol% Sb2O3 doped ATO films deposited at 200°C, oxygen pressure of 8Pa for 0.5h with annealing at 550°C for 0.5h, an optimal electrical resistivity of 1.2×10−2Ωcm with an average optical transparency in the visible region of 85.8% is obtained. Under the optimum processing conditions, the grain size of ATO films is about 20nm and the Sb/Sn ratio is 20.3%, which are in good agreement with the structure and component of targets, indicating the ATO films with controllable microstructure and element component can be obtained using the ATO nanopowders sintered targets by PLD method.

Abstract: Solar cells are the sole power sources in earth bound satellites. Temperature of solar cell blanket is a very important parameter that needs to be measured accurately throughout the mission. The present arrangement measures solar panel temperature and not solar cell blanket temperature as needed. Solar cell temperature can be measured by using the change of its capacitance with temperature. A method to measure solar cell blanket temperature in the range −180°C to +80°C in space using solar cell itself has been explored here. Use of silicon BSR, gallium arsenide or multijunction cells has been presented. The method can accurately measure transient variation of solar cell blanket temperature.

Abstract: Back contact improvement is one of the most crucial issues for the formation of a low resistance contact and enhanced efficiency in CdS/CdTe based photovoltaic cells. We studied Ni/CdTe back contact formation with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and observed the effect of a thin MoOx inter-layer between Ni and CdTe films. Contrasting differences in the interface formation and core level structure were observed, indicating that the presence of a thin MoOx inter-layer was effective in reducing the reaction between Ni and the native tellurium oxide at the CdTe surface. The improvement of device performance is explained based on the evolution of core levels and the valence band region during the Ni/MoOx/CdTe interface formation, wherein MoOx serves as a high work function buffer layer.

Abstract: Ypi1 is an essential regulator of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Glc7 protein phosphatase. Although lack of Ypi1 results in a dramatic blockage in the G2/M cell cycle transition, with abnormally shaped large buds and short spindles, the molecular bases for this phenotype are still obscure. We report here that depletion of Ypi1 results in stabilization of the Pds1 securin, suggesting the activation of a G2/M checkpoint. Depletion of Ypi1 in cells deleted for MAD1/MAD2 or RAD9 still resulted in G2/M blockage, in spite that these cells lack key components of the spindle assembly and DNA damage checkpoints signaling, respectively. In contrast, deletion of SWE1, which encodes a protein kinase required for the morphogenesis checkpoint signaling, allowed passage through G2/M and recovery of normal cell morphology, although the cells did not proliferate. Depletion of Ypi1 caused stabilization of the Swe1 kinase, persistent phosphorylation of protein kinase Cdc28 at Y19, a landmark for morphogenesis checkpoint activation, and depletion of the Cdc11 septin, which explains the failure to form properly assembled septin rings at the bud necks. Deletion of SWE1 restored normal Cdc11 levels in the absence of Ypi1. These results demonstrate that Ypi1 plays an important role in the morphogenesis checkpoint, possibly by regulating Swe1.

Abstract: Laminar shear stress (LSS), induced by flowing blood, plays a key role in determining vascular health by modulating endothelial behaviour and vascular tone. In systemic endothelium many of the beneficial effects of chronic LSS are mediated through the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), but little is known regarding the role of chronic LSS in the renal glomerulus. We demonstrate that exposure of glomerular endothelial cells to chronic (>24h) LSS of 10dyn/cm2 increases phosphorylation of extra-cellular signal-related kinase 5 (ERK5) and increases expression of KLF2, leading to increased expression of the downstream molecules endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), thrombomodulin, endothelin-1 and nitric oxide. However, the proportion of eNOS which was phosphorylated at serine 1117 and threonine 495 residues was decreased. We demonstrated dependence of these effects on the ERK5 pathway by using the inhibitor UO126. We found high levels of KLF2 expression in human glomeruli confirming the relevance of our in vitro observations and, as KLF2 is specifically induced by chronic LSS, suggesting the physiological importance of shear stress in the glomerulus. Conditioned medium from glomerular endothelial cells under chronic LSS decreased podocyte monolayer resistance and increased phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. The latter effect was more pronounced using a novel insert-based direct co-culture system in which endothelial cells were exposed to chronic LSS. These data provide the first direct evidence of glomerular endothelial cell to podocyte cross-talk.

Abstract: In this work we report for the first time on the creation of thermal acceptors after laser irradiation of a phosphorous doped p-type silicon substrate in ambient atmosphere. The concentration of these defects up to 1020cm−3 is leading to a conductivity change from n- to p-type just beneath the surface. Electrochemical capacitance voltage (ECV) measurements followed by resistivity measurements confirm this conversion of conductivity. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements show significant oxygen incorporation after laser irradiation. The comparison of saturation current density and lock-in thermography measurements of processed wafers in ambient and in nitrogen atmosphere reveal that these defects are electrically active recombination centres that disappear in absence of oxygen. In simulations of the temperature profile during laser processing a correlation between the pulse energy density (EP) and the appearance of thermal acceptors has been observed. The influence of these laser induced acceptor defects on solar cell parameters has been finally investigated. An efficiency loss of 1.3% absolute pertinent to pulse energies usually applied in laser doping process under ambient atmosphere could be avoided by laser processing in nitrogen atmosphere.

Abstract: CuCrxMn2−xO4 (x=0.5, 1) spinels, novel pigments for spectrally selective paints, have been prepared through a sol–gel combustion synthesis process. Thickness Sensitive Spectrally Selective (TSSS) paint coatings, using CuCrxMn2−xO4 (x=0.5, 1) obtained at varied calcined temperatures (500∼1100°C) as pigment, were deposited on top of aluminum substrates by an cost-effective spray coating method and characterized by reflectance measurements over the spectral range of 0.3–20μm. Influence of pigment species and coating thickness on optical properties of paint coatings was investigated. Results suggest that CuCr0.5Mn1.5O4-based coatings are more favorable than CuCrMnO4-based ones and coatings using 700°C calcined CuCr0.5Mn1.5O4 as pigment exhibit the optimum spectral selectivity (αs=0.92∼0.93, εT=0.22∼0.31). Difference in powder thermal emittances reveals that suitable pigments can be pre-chosen before fabricating paint coatings to obtain optimum spectral selectivity. Long-term stability tests of the TSSS paint coatings were performed according to the methodology worked out within IEA-SHC Task X and the results confirmed that coatings in this study could be safely used during collector's lifetime without degradation in performance.

Abstract: Novel random copolymers containing dithienylcyclopentadienone, thiophene and benzothiadiazole were synthesized and photovoltaic properties of these materials were evaluated. Thermal, structural, optical and electrochemical characterization of the synthesized copolymers was carried out. These thermally stable copolymers are solution processable unlike the homopolymer. The absorption spectra indicated that with the incorporation of alkyl chains in the thiophene moiety, the onset of absorption increases and hence band gap decreases (1.47eV to 1.41eV). Bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated with the blend of copolymer and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the active material and device parameters were extracted. The copolymer consists of alkyl thiophene exhibit higher open circuit voltage than the copolymer consisting of thiophene moiety.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
We report the 8-year follow-up of 34 patients aged≥69 years old with NHL included in a phase IIb open-label randomized parallel groups study to evaluate the effectiveness of amifostine in preventing the toxicity of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP regime) .
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients were randomized to receive classical CHOP (cyclophosphamide 750mg/ m2, doxorubicin 50mg/m2, vincristine 1.4mg/m2 [maximum 2mg] on day 1 and prednisone 100mg/day for 5 days) or CHOP plus amifostine (6cycles of amifostine 910mg/m2 on day 1). Efficacy (time to progression, TTP; disease-free survival, DFS; overall survival, OS) and toxicity endpoints were evaluated.
RESULTS
Thirty-four patients were randomized to A-CHOP (n=18) or CHOP (n=16). Patients with A-CHOP vs CHOP had significantly lower toxicity; neutropenia grade 4 ocurred in 13/92 (13%) vs 23/85 (27%, P=0.007) cycles, febrile neutropenia in 3/92 A-CHOP (3%) vs 8/85 (10%, P=.056) CHOP cycles, hospitalization for toxicity in 4/92 (4%) A-CHOP vs 11/85 (13%, P=.05) CHOP cycles. Median hospitalization stay for toxicity was 5 days with A-CHOP vs 8 days with CHOP (P=.05). There were no significant differences at 8 years in TTP (A-CHOP, 48.9% vs CHOP, 36.3%; P=.65), DFS (A-CHOP, 72.9% vs CHOP 55.6%; P=.50) and OS (A-CHOP, 44.3% vs CHOP, 54.4%). There was no long-term toxicity of clinical interest. The only prognostic factor identified to 8 years was the International Prognostic Index (IPI low/low intermediate risk vs high intermediate/high risk; HR=2.98; CI 95%:1.01-8.77; P=.048).
CONCLUSION
These results show that amifostine can be added to the standard CHOP treatment schedule with less acute toxicity and without influencing the outcome.

Abstract: The cytoskeleton is a highly complex network of three major intracellular filaments, microfilaments (MFs), microtubules (MTs) and intermediate filaments (IFs). This network plays a key role in the control of cell shape, division, functions and interactions in animal organs and tissues. Dysregulation of the network can contribute to numerous human diseases. Although small HSPs (sHSPs) and in particular HSP27 (HSPB1) or αB-crystallin (HSPB5) display a wide range of cellular properties, they are mostly known for their ability to protect cells under stress conditions. Mutations in some sHSPs have been found to affect their ability to interact with cytoskeleton proteins, leading to IF aggregation phenotypes that mimick diseases related to disorders in IF proteins (i.e. desmin, vimentin and neuro-filaments). The aim of this review is to discuss new findings that point towards the possible involvement of IFs in the cytoprotective functions of sHSPs, both in physiological and pathological settings, including the likelihood that sHSPs such as HSPB1 may play a role during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during fibrosis or cancer progression. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Small HSPs in physiology and pathology.

Abstract: Aiming at the development of a cost-effective and industrially up-scalable process for the production of p-Si PERL-type solar cells, this work focuses on the selection and the development of an optimal rear-contacting method of screen-printed aluminum back electrodes through AlOx-based rear passivation stacks. Laser-Fired Contacts are first optimized by developing dedicated characterization protocols to define an optimal laser process. Laser parameters are systematically varied (e.g. pulse energy, power density, focus, and contact pitch) and their effect on the contacts quality is analyzed. Besides, a new contacting method, called Extended-Laser-Ablation (ELA), is presented, allowing even higher efficiencies to be attained thanks to better quality of local back-surface fields. Both contacting routes are then implemented and compared in the PERL pilot production process flow to investigate their effects on cells performances. Top efficiencies of 19.13% (AlOx/SiNx) and 19.5% (SiO2/AlOx/SiNx) are reached when the ELA process is used on monocrystalline Cz Si, using a close-to-standard process (75Ω/sq homogeneous emitter, screen-printed contacts, standard cleaning procedure), without any final forming gas annealing step required.

Abstract: We present a study on the electronic properties of grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) thin films by means of Kelvin probe force microscopy. As grown as well as KCN-treated films were investigated comparatively. No influence of the chemical treatment on the electronic properties of GBs was found. GBs generally exhibited large variations in their electronic properties. By means of a novel method of data analysis both potential barriers for holes and electrons were found at GBs, in a range from −118mV to +114mV, as well as GBs without potential barrier. No dependence of the electronic GB-properties on the Ga-content was detected. Consequently, we conclude that there is no correlation between the electronic properties of GBs and the obtained maximum efficiencies of CIGSe thin film solar cells as a function of the Ga-content.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the high performance of GaAs solar cells with dual-layer CdS quantum dots (QDs) carried by flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film. Several parameters were enhanced, including the short circuit current, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency, which were measured under white light illumination similar to the solar spectrum. The flexible PDMS film was fabricated using the spin-coating technique, and was then used to embed dual-layer CdS QDs. Different concentrations of QDs were applied in this design to test the optimal combination. The proposed scheme enhances power conversion efficiency by 22%, compared to a GaAs solar cell without CdS QDs. The photon down-conversion capability in the ultraviolet (UV) range and additional anti-reflection capability in the longer visible-IR range were verified through the external quantum efficiency.

Abstract: Absract
In the present work we compare the performance of organic solar cells, based on the bulk heterojunction system of P3HT:PCBM when adequate silver nanoparticles (NPs) are incorporated in two distinct places among the device structure. Introduction of NPs on top of the transparent anode revealed better overall performance with an increased efficiency of 17%. Alternatively, placing the NPs on top of the active photovoltaic layer resulted to 25% higher photo-current generation albeit with inferior electrical characteristics (i.e series and shunt resistance). Our findings suggest that enhanced scattering to non-specular directions from NPs site is maximized when penetrating light meets the particles after the polymer blend, but even this mechanism is not sufficient enough to explain the enhanced short circuit current observed. A second mechanism should be feasible; that is plasmon enhancement which is more efficient in the case where NPs are in direct contact with the polymer blend. J–V characteristics measured in the dark showed that NPs placed on top of the ITO film act as enhanced hole conducting sites, as evident by the lower series resistance values in these cells, suggesting this mechanism as more significant in this case.

Abstract: The optical properties of sputtered Cu2O thin films doped with the nitrogen concentrations between 1 and 2.5 at% have been investigated by spectrophotometric measurements. All the doped samples exhibit two clearly defined absorption bands at energies below the gap, with an intensity well correlated with the N concentration. This result suggests Cu2O as a promising material for the development of intermediate band solar cells, also considering the band gap of about 2eV which is the optimal value for this kind of devices. Moreover, the sample with the highest doping shows a resistivity of 1.14Ωcm, which is the lowest value ever reported for this semiconductor. As a collateral result, we provide a first estimation of the Relative Sensitivity Factors (RSF) of nitrogen and oxygen atoms under Cs+ bombardment in a Cu2O matrix.

Abstract: Cells contain low amounts of uracil in DNA which can be the result of dUTP misincorporation during replication or cytosine deamination. Elimination of uracil in the base excision repair pathway yields an abasic site, which is potentially mutagenic unless repaired. The Trypanosoma brucei genome presents a single uracil-DNA glycosylase responsible for removal of uracil from DNA. Here we establish that no excision activity is detected on U:G, U:A pairs or single-strand uracil-containing DNA in uracil-DNA glycosylase null mutant cell extracts, indicating the absence of back-up uracil excision activities. While procyclic forms can survive with moderate amounts of uracil in DNA, an analysis of the mutation rate and spectra in mutant cells revealed a hypermutator phenotype where the predominant events were GC to AT transitions and insertions. Defective elimination of uracil via the base excision repair pathway gives rise to hypersensitivity to antifolates and oxidative stress and an increased number of DNA strand breaks, suggesting the activation of alternative DNA repair pathways. Finally, we show that uracil-DNA glycosylase defective cells exhibit reduced infectivity in vivo demonstrating that efficient uracil elimination is important for survival within the mammalian host.

Abstract: Endothelial cells play a central role in inflammatory responses, mediating leukocyte and solute traffic from blood vessels into the tissue, and are therefore key targets for anti-inflammatory therapies. Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are important signal transducers in inflammation and cancer, however there are 8 different PI3K catalytic isoforms, several of which have been shown to play distinct roles in cellular responses. Isoform-selective inhibitors have recently been described, but their effects on endothelial cell responses have not been compared. Here we compare the effects of the pan-PI3K inhibitor wortmannin with that of four more isoform-selective inhibitors, PI-103, TGX-221, AS604850 and IC87114, on endothelial cells stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα. We find that PI-103 and wortmannin are most effective at reducing both endothelial permeability and leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM), which correlates with a decrease in both the activity of the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 and its association with VE-cadherin. PI-103-related compounds are therefore likely to be good candidates for treating chronic inflammatory responses involving TNFα.

Abstract: 3-Bromopyruvate (3BrPA) is an antitumor agent that alkylates the thiol groups of enzymes and has been proposed as a treatment for neoplasias because of its specific reactivity with metabolic energy transducing enzymes in tumor cells. In this study, we show that the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca2+) ATPase (SERCA) type 1 is one of the target enzymes of 3BrPA activity. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum vesicles (SRV) were incubated in the presence of 1mM 3BrPA, which was unable to inhibit the ATPase activity of SERCA. However, Ca2+-uptake activity was significantly inhibited by 80% with 150μM 3BrPA. These results indicate that 3BrPA has the ability to uncouple the ATP hydrolysis from the calcium transport activities. In addition, we observed that the inclusion of 2mM reduced glutathione (GSH) in the reaction medium with different 3BrPA concentrations promoted an increase in 40% in ATPase activity and protects the inhibition promoted by 3BrPA in calcium uptake activity. This derivatization is accompanied by a decrease of reduced cysteine (Cys), suggesting that GSH and 3BrPA increases SERCA activity and transport by pyruvylation and/or S-glutathiolation mediated by GSH at a critical Cys residues of the SERCA.

Abstract: A better understanding of molecular pathways involved in malignant transformation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is essential for the development of novel and efficient anti-cancer drugs. To delineate the global metabolism of HNSCC, we report 1H NMR-based metabolic profiling of HNSCC cells from five different patients that were derived from various sites of the upper aerodigestive tract, including the floor of mouth, tongue and larynx. Primary cultures of normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK) from three different donors were used for comparison. 1H NMR spectra of polar and non-polar extracts of cells were used to identify more than thirty-five metabolites. Principal component analysis performed on the NMR data revealed a clear classification of NHOK and HNSCC cells. HNSCC cells exhibited significantly altered levels of various metabolites that clearly revealed dysregulation in multiple metabolic events, including Warburg effect, oxidative phosphorylation, energy metabolism, TCA cycle anaplerotic flux, glutaminolysis, hexosamine pathway, osmo-regulatory and anti-oxidant mechanism. In addition, significant alterations in the ratios of phosphatidylcholine/lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphocholine/glycerophosphocholine, and elevated arachidonic acid observed in HNSCC cells reveal an altered membrane choline phospholipid metabolism (MCPM). Furthermore, significantly increased activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), particularly cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) observed in all the HNSCC cells confirm an altered MCPM. In summary, the metabolomic findings presented here can be useful to further elucidate the biological aspects that lead to HNSCC, and also provide a rational basis for monitoring molecular mechanisms in response to chemotherapy. Moreover, cPLA2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for anti-cancer therapy of HNSCC.

Abstract: A new HfMoN(H)/HfMoN(L)/HfON/Al2O3 tandem absorber is designed and developed for high temperature solar thermal applications. The first absorber layer, HfMoN(H) is designed to have higher metallic content than the second HfMoN(L) layer. By varying the nitrogen flow rate, two different HfMoN layers with different refractive indices were deposited on SS substrates. The optical constants (n and k) measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry showed that HfMoN(H) and HfMoN(L) are the main absorber layers and HfON/Al2O3 acts as a double layer antireflection coating. The gradual decrease in the refractive indices from the substrate to the top resulted in increase in the absorptance, which was confirmed by the ellipsometric measurements. The optimized four layer tandem absorber exhibited high absorptance (α=0.94–0.95) and low thermal emittance (ε82°C=0.13–0.14). The four layer tandem absorber was thermally stable up to 600°C for 450h and 650°C for 100h in vacuum. Whereas, coatings heat-treated in air were thermally stable up to 475°C for 34h.

Abstract: Acidic texturing of multi crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers often leads to rough surfaces with areas of strong etch attacks which we call trench structures. Particularly at sites containing crystal defects such as grain boundaries and dislocations, trench structures are created. These trench structures have often been reported as detrimental to solar cell performance. In this paper, a detailed statistical analysis of the influence of trench structures on solar cell efficiency is carried out. It is shown that their influence on cell efficiency, as well as open circuit voltage, short circuit current and fill factor, is only very minor. The material quality determines the diffusion length of the minority carriers and predominantly impacts the solar cell efficiency. Moreover, it has been established that trench structures do not significantly influence surface roughness and do not lead to shunting losses. However, the statistical model indicates that materials with many crystal defects, and thus lower quality and a smoother (and hence more reflecting) texture lead to slightly higher efficiencies compared to solar cells with a rougher texture. The higher efficiency obtained with smoother textures for this kind of material might be caused by the absence of trench structures. Furthermore, it has been found in this work that for these acidic textures, surface roughness correlates to weighted reflection and hence only one of these parameters has to be determined to analyze an acidic texture.

Abstract: Aerosol jet printing is investigated as a new deposition method for a current collecting grid in indium tin oxide (ITO) free organic solar cells with an inverted layer sequence. In this device configuration, the ITO layer which usually serves as the hole contact is replaced by a transparent highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer in combination with a silver grid deposited by aerosol jet printing. Since the cells are illuminated from the grid side, the optimisation of the grid design is a trade-off between area coverage and conductivity of the grid lines. These factors have been controlled by the printing parameters such as chuck temperature, printing speed and the number of printing passes. In this paper, we demonstrate that continuous, conductive grid lines with a minimum line width of 58μm can be processed on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. For single pass printing the area coverage varied from 5.8% to 11.9% with corresponding effective sheet resistances ranging from 8.9Ω to 1.5Ω. The ITO-free inverted devices with aerosol jet printed grid (an active area of 1.1cm2) show comparable performance to the cells with an evaporated gold grid. The effective sheet resistance can be further decreased by multiple printing passes without increasing the area coverage proportionally due to an improved aspect ratio. By increasing the conductivity and aspect ratio by multiple line printing, the cell length in the module structures can be significantly extended.

Abstract: The first genetic factor identified for childhood asthma by genome-wide association study (GWAS) is the locus on chromosome 17q21, harboring the Orosomucoid 1-like 3 (ORMDL3) gene. ORMDL3 is implicated in facilitation of endoplasmic reticulum-mediated inflammatory responses, believed to underlie its association with asthma. In the present study, we demonstrated that mRNA expression of ORMDL3 is significantly increased in the peripheral blood of recurrent wheeze patients compared with normal control subjects by real-time RT-PCR. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in human ORMDL3 regulation, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of ORMDL3. Applying 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end analysis (RACE), we revealed that ORMDL3 gene used multiple transcriptional start sites (TSSs). Using a series of 5′ deletion promoter plasmids in luciferase reporter assays, we identified that the proximal minimal promoter of ORMDL3 was located within the region −84/+58 relative to the TSS. Mutational analysis, RNA interference experiments and sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated that transcriptional activity of the ORMDL3 gene was cooperatively regulated by multiple transcription factors, including Ets-1, p300 and CREB. The expression levels of Ets-1, p300 and CREB were increased in the peripheral blood of recurrent wheeze patients compared with normal control subjects and showed a strong linear correlation with the expression of ORMDL3. Our findings indicate that Ets-1, p300 and CREB binding to the promoter region drive the ORMDL3 transcription.

Abstract: The building sector is known to make a large contribution to total energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Phase change materials (PCMs) have been considered for thermal energy storage in buildings. The aim of this study was to improve the thermal conductivity of PCMs applicable as building materials using a radiant floor heating system. Using exfoliated graphite nanoplatelets (xGnP), composite PCMs were prepared by mixing and melting techniques for high dispersibility, thermal conductivity and latent heat storage. xGnP of 3 and 5wt% was added to three types of liquid pure PCMs (octadecane, hexadecane and paraffin) with different melting points. The composite PCMs loaded with xGnP were characterized by using the SEM technique. The thermal properties of the composite PCM loaded with xGnP were determined by thermal conductivity analysis and DSC analysis. SEM morphology showed homogenous and ordered dispersion of xGnP in the three types of PCMs. The thermal conductivity of composite PCMs was increased with the xGnP loaded contents. The DSC results showed that the melting temperature and latent heat of the composite PCMs loaded with xGnP was maintained. The latent heat of composite PCMs slightly decreases when loading with xGnP. As a result, composite PCMs loaded with xGnP can be considered as energy saving building materials for a residential building using a radiant floor heating system.

Abstract: The effect of dye concentration on the efficiency of a luminescent concentrator based on a perylene diimide (PDI) derivative incorporated in poly(methyl methacrylate) films cast on glass substrates is described. The predictions of ray-trace modelling are compared to experimental data from integrating sphere luminescence measurements. Increasing the PDI concentration leads to aggregation of the dye and an associated shift in the emission spectrum. The larger Stokes shift between emission and absorption spectra of the aggregated form reduces luminescence re-absorption and increases collection efficiency. However, the lower fluorescence quantum yield of the PDI aggregates restricts overall absorbed light to luminescence conversion. The relevance of the results to optimize organic molecule based luminescent solar concentrators is discussed.

Abstract: Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a dietary fat, has been considered beneficial in metabolic syndrome. Despite several findings indicating that CLA improves glucose clearance, little information is available regarding the cellular dynamics of CLA on skeletal muscle. We sought to investigate the role of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in cis-9, trans-11(c9,t11) and trans-10, cis-12 (t10,c12) CLA isomer-mediated glucose transport by L6 myotubes. t10,c12-CLA stimulated both intracellular Ca2+ release (Cai2+) and CaMKII phosphorylation, whereas c9,t11-CLA showed only modest effects on both. Sequestering Cai2+ with BAPTA/AM abrogated the effect of both CLA isomers on Akt substrate-160kDa (AS160) phosphorylation and glucose uptake by myotubes. Exposing myotubes to KN-93 or autocamtide 2-related inhibitory peptide to block CaMKII activity prevented both CLA isomers from inducing AS160 phosphorylation and glucose transport. Likewise, genetic knockdown of CaMKII in myotubes using siRNA completely abolished CLA isomer-mediated glucose uptake. These results indicate that CLA isomers require Cai2+–CaMKII to mediate glucose uptake. Evidence that CaMKII blockers inhibit t10,c12-CLA-mediated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation indicated that CaMKII acts upstream of AMPK in response to t10,c12-CLA. Lastly, CLA isomers stimulated the formation of reactive oxygen species but had no effect on stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun NH2-terminal kinase. These data establish that t10,c12-CLA acts via Cai2+–CaMKII–AMPK–AS160 to stimulate skeletal muscle glucose transport, whereas the mechanism of c9,t11-CLA remains unclear. Given that impairments in muscle glucose utilisation are apparent in metabolic syndrome, delineating the molecular mechanisms by which CLA isomers mediate muscle glucose uptake may identify new approaches to manage this condition.

Abstract: Multi-junction solar cell (MJSC) was integrated into an H-type reactor system to carry out water-splitting reaction without external circuit and bias. In the H-type reactor, hydrogen and oxygen could be evolved separately. Different kinds of materials were deposited on the bottom cell to prevent corrosion. These materials include silver, platinum, and iron oxide layers which were prepared via an electron beam-induced deposition (EBID) method. Under visible-light irradiation, hydrogen production was achieved by using the MJSC; however, only a small amount of oxygen was evolved. The photogenerated holes may oxidize the photoelectrode instead of water, meaning that Ge subcell or the deposited thin film was oxidized during the photoreaction. The thin films ranked from highest hydrogen evolution to lowest are: Pt> bare Ge> Fe3O4> Ag. The photoelectrode deposited with metal thin film showed better activity due to its higher conductivity, except Ag. The poor performance of photoelectrode with silver thin film was due to the formation of silver oxide during photoreaction which may trap electrons, lowering the amount of electrons available to carry out water reduction. The chemical bias for H-type reactor system was eliminated by using sodium sulfate as the electrolyte. The ratio of evolved hydrogen to oxygen was near 2:1, suggesting that real water-splitting reaction can be achieved by using the MJSC incorporated H-type reactor system without chemical bias.

Abstract: An inorganic thin film luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) is characterized experimentally in detail in terms of all the separate light transport steps, which result in the concentration of sunlight. The results are discussed in the context of application as windows in buildings, called building integrated (BI) LSCs. A 3μm thin film of Eu3+ doped Lu2O3 was chosen because of its large Stokes shift, which excludes all waveguide losses due to self-absorption and allowed to study losses caused by scattering at interfaces of the LSC. A model is presented that can be used to calculate the LSC light transport efficiency as a function of window size, which only needs the easily measurable linear attenuation as input. Measurements show that the quantum efficiency (ηQE) of our LSC is 13%, which is less than ideal, mainly due to a 44% luminescence quantum efficiency and a 45% waveguide efficiency. Our modelling relates BI-LSC efficiency to window color, and reveals that the linear attenuation coefficient of an LSC should be higher than 1000mm. This is in contrast to values in the order of tens of millimeters which have been measured for the LSC in this paper.

Abstract: S100A8 and S100A9 are strongly expressed in epithelial cells of human prostate cancer. However, the regulation of their expression is unclear. Here we show that S100A8 and to a lesser extent S100A9 mRNA expression is induced by prostaglandin E2 in a dose and time-dependent manner in PC-3 prostate cancer cells as well as in BPH-1 benign prostatic epithelial cells. Prostanoid receptor EP2 antagonist AH6809 and EP4 antagonist AH23848, as well as protein kinase A inhibitor H89, inhibited prostaglandin E2 mediated increase in S100A8 mRNA expression as well as promoter activity. Sequence analysis detected a potential binding site of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta within the proximal S100A8 promoter. CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta overexpression increased S100A8 mRNA and protein expression as well as its promoter activity. The latter was prevented by mutation of the potential CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta binding site within the S100A8 promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed increased binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta to the S100A8 promoter in prostaglandin E2 treated cells. Knockdown of CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta by siRNA blocked prostaglandin E2 mediated induction of S100A8 promoter activity and mRNA expression. Our results indicate that in prostate cancer cells, S100A8 expression is stimulated by prostaglandin E2 via EP2 and EP4 receptors through activation of the protein kinase A signaling pathway and subsequent stimulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding-protein-beta binding to the S100A8 promoter.

Abstract: Here we report about the use of spatially resolved fluorescence spectroscopy for non-destructive analysis of encapsulants in outdoor weathered commercial PV modules. Photovoltaic modules with crystalline Si-cells of seven German manufacturers were analyzed after 2 years outdoor weathering in four different climates. For the first time spatially resolved images of the polymer fluorescence for complete photovoltaic modules are reported. The presented results show that the fluorescence intensity and distribution is inhomogeneous within any module. The fluorescence intensity and its spatial distribution depend on the climate, particularly the weathering site. Diffusive processes in the polymer layer between glass and silicon cell can be evaluated with this method. Cracks in the wafer, visible with electroluminescence, show up in spatially resolved fluorescence images as well. The diffusion through the cracks influences the spatial distribution of the fluorescence intensity. Compared to averaging methods, detailed information about the impact of the different degradation factors like UV-irradiation and moisture ingress on the degradation processes can only be obtained using spatially resolved fluorescence measurements. For PV-modules investigated in this study areas can be identified and compared where similar degradation parameters can be assumed. This will allow improving to quantitatively interpret measurement results.

The optimized ZnO superhydrophobic coating on the absorber surface demonstrates extraordinary water repellency (with contact angle >155°), improved absorptance (>0.96) and excellent broadband anti-reflection in the visible range of the solar spectrum. The multi-functional ZnO coating was stable up to 450°C (in air and vacuum), indicating its reliability for high temperature photothermal conversion applications.

Abstract: It has been shown that β-(1→3)-(1→4)-glucans (BG34) from barley and oats can trigger recognition and internalization by murine and human macrophages. Increasing evidence has suggested that macrophage recognition and internalization of BG34 are dramatically affected by the purity of BG34, the molecular weight and chemical modification. In this study, we investigated the structural features of BG34 for macrophage recognition and internalization. We prepared homogeneous BG34s of 10kDa (BG34-10), 200kDa (BG34-200) and 500kDa (BG34-500) with high purity, and then introduced green fluorescence FITC to the reducing ends (Re) or main chain (Mc). The results of size exclusion chromatography, 13C NMR, fluorescence microscopy, FACS analyses and MTS assay demonstrated that non-toxic BG34 of 10kDa (BG34-10) effectively trigger macrophage internalization. The internalization was adversely affected by modifying the main chain of BG34-10 but not the reducing end. Studies using blocking antibodies on several CD11b+ and CD11b− cells suggested that CD11b may play an important role in mediating macrophage internalization of BG34-10. Quantitative RT-PCR and intracellular cytokine stain revealed that macrophages generate increased level of CD11b and TNF-α in response to BG34-10. This study for the first time demonstrated the molecular size (10kDa) and pattern of modification (reducing end modification) for BG34-10 to mediate macrophage internalization. Since BG34 is water soluble, biocompatible and biodegradable FDA-approved material, this mechanism of BG34-10 can be used to design drug delivery system targeting macrophages.

Abstract: A class of alkoxy substituted dihydronaphthyl-C60 derivatives, such as 2-methoxy-(5,8)-dihydronaphthyl-(6,7)- [6,6]–C60 (MDNC) and its bisadduct (Bis-MDNC) with high-lying LUMO level, were synthesized and evaluated as electron acceptors in polymer solar cells. Influence of substituent groups (methyloxy, benzyloxy, benzoyloxy, hexyloxy, and 3-ethoxycarbonylpropyloxy) on photovoltaic and electrochemical properties regarding these fullerene derivatives were studied. The polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell using Bis-MDNC blend with poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as photoactive layer showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.58% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.83V, which is superior to the P3HT: PCBM control device (3.25% PCE with Voc of 0.59V). This work exemplifies a facile functionalization and an alterable photovoltaic behavior susceptible to substituent groups in the dihydronaphthyl-C60 derivatives.

Abstract: We discovered that fringe structures of ZnO film in solar cells of inverted structures penetrate through the active layer made of low bandgap polymers. The ZnO penetration leads to leakage current of the solar cells. To prevent the ZnO penetration, the thin film morphology was modified. By changing the solvent and inserting TiO2 nanorods between ZnO film and the active layer, penetration can be avoided, so Rsh is improved from 110.3Ωcm2 to 374.7Ωcm2 and Voc from 0.36V to 0.66V. This result provides a promising route for employing low bandgap polymers to air-stable inverted structures with solution process. It is possible that inverted low bandgap polymer solar cells can achieve the goals of high performance and air stability.

Abstract: For transparent front contacts of nanostructured silicon solar cells aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al), deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD), is investigated. For this purpose it is crucial that the ZnO:Al layer covers the nanostructures conformally. ZnO:Al deposition at a temperature of 225°C, compatible with the underlying solar cell structures, yields a resistivity of 1.2×10−3Ωcm and 85% mean optical transmittance in the VIS–NIR range (<1300nm). The complex dielectric function of the ALD–ZnO:Al is determined by fitting optical spectra with a multi-oscillator model. An investigation of the layer structure shows a preferential growth in the c-direction of the hexagonal ZnO crystal and 100–200nm long wedge-shaped crystallites. I–V measurements on planar ZnO:Al/a-Si:H(n/p)/c-Si(n+/p+) test structures reveal the nature of the ZnO:Al contact to both n- and p-type a-Si:H. Simple planar solar cells exhibited an excellent rectification behavior and open circuit voltages VOC=620–640mV. The feasibility of nanostructure silicon heterojunction solar cells is demonstrated by showing the conformal coating of deep Si nanowire structures.
