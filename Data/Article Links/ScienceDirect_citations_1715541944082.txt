Abstract: We studied the regulation of RANKL expression in myeloma by promoter DNA methylation. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction showed complete methylation of RANKL promoter in WL-2 myeloma cells but partial methylation in eight other lines. 5-AzadC treatment of WL-2 cells led to demethylation and re-expression of RANKL. Transwell and contact co-culture of WL-2 cells with normal bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) resulted in comparable repression of DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) and re-expression of RANKL in WL-2 cells. Moreover, treatment of WL-2 cells with TNFα led to repression of DNMT1 and re-expression of RANKL in association with upregulation of miR-140-3p and miR-126, which are partially offset by addition of anti-TNFα antibody to transwell-coculture of WL2 with BMSC. Taken together, our results showed that TNFα in the marrow microenvironment led to RANKL demethylation and re-expression in myeloma cells through DNMT1 repression and upregulation of miR-126-3p and miR-140, both known to repress DNMT1 translation.

Abstract: In the majority of cells, the integrity of the plasmalemma is recurrently compromised by mechanical or chemical stress. Serum complement or bacterial pore-forming toxins can perforate the plasma membrane provoking uncontrolled Ca2+ influx, loss of cytoplasmic constituents and cell lysis. Plasmalemmal blebbing has previously been shown to protect cells against bacterial pore-forming toxins. The activation of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), an ATP-gated trimeric membrane cation channel, triggers Ca2+ influx and induces blebbing. We have investigated the role of the P2X7R as a regulator of plasmalemmal protection after toxin-induced membrane perforation caused by bacterial streptolysin O (SLO). Our results show that the expression and activation of the P2X7R furnishes cells with an increased chance of surviving attacks by SLO. This protective effect can be demonstrated not only in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells transfected with the P2X7R, but also in human mast cells (HMC-1), which express the receptor endogenously. In addition, this effect is abolished by treatment with blebbistatin or A-438079, a selective P2X7R antagonist. Thus blebbing, which is elicited by the ATP-mediated, paracrine activation of the P2X7R, is part of a cellular non-immune defense mechanism. It pre-empts plasmalemmal damage and promotes cellular survival. This mechanism is of considerable importance for cells of the immune system which carry the P2X7R and which are specifically exposed to toxin attacks.

Abstract: We previously identified the Arabidopsis thaliana-derived decapeptide OSIP108, which increases tolerance of plants and yeast cells to oxidative stress. As excess copper (Cu) is known to induce oxidative stress and apoptosis, and is characteristic for the human pathology Wilson disease, we investigated the effect of OSIP108 on Cu-induced toxicity in yeast. We found that OSIP108 increased yeast viability in the presence of toxic Cu concentrations, and decreased the prevalence of Cu-induced apoptotic markers. Next, we translated these results to the human hepatoma HepG2 cell line, demonstrating anti-apoptotic activity of OSIP108 in this cell line. In addition, we found that OSIP108 did not affect intracellular Cu levels in HepG2 cells, but preserved HepG2 mitochondrial ultrastructure. As Cu is known to induce acid sphingomyelinase activity of HepG2 cells, we performed a sphingolipidomic analysis of OSIP108-treated HepG2 cells. We demonstrated that OSIP108 decreased the levels of several sphingoid bases and ceramide species. Moreover, exogenous addition of the sphingoid base dihydrosphingosine abolished the protective effect of OSIP108 against Cu-induced cell death in yeast. These findings indicate the potential of OSIP108 to prevent Cu-induced apoptosis, possibly via its effects on sphingolipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (Map2k4) is a dual specificity serin/threonine protein kinase that is unique among all MAP2Ks in activating two different subfamilies of mitogen-activated protein kinases, the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 kinases. Map2k4 is essential during embryogenesis and involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. However, studies on its role in cancer development revealed partially conflicting data. In the present study, we report the identification of a novel splice variant of Map2k4, Map2k4δ, with an additional exon in front of the substrate binding D-domain. Map2k4δ is expressed together with Map2k4 in various tissues from rat, mouse and human. In PC12 cells, both splice variants control cell cycle progression and basal apoptosis by using different signaling pathways. If expression and activation of Map2k4 and Map2k4δ are at a certain, cell type-specific equilibrium, an appropriate cell growth is ensured. Overexpression of one kinase disrupts the intricate balance and either results in a highly proliferative or pro-apoptotic phenotype, partially reflecting the discrepancies in the literature on Map2k4 and its role in tumor development. Our findings contribute to the understanding of previous studies and point out that Map2k4 has not always a definite function, but rather triggers a cellular reaction in concert with other modulators.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a chronic inflammatory condition and affects a large number of elderly people. Aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) occupy an important role in valvular calcification and CAVD progression. While pro-inflammatory mechanisms are capable of inducing the osteogenic responses in AVICs, the molecular interaction between pro-inflammatory and pro-osteogenic mechanisms remains poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) plays a role in mediating pro-osteogenic factor expression in human AVICs. AVICs were isolated from normal human aortic valves and cultured in M199 medium. Treatment with leukocyte function-associated factor-1 (LFA-1, an ICAM-1 ligand) up-regulated the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and resulted in increased alkaline phosphatase activity and formation of calcification nodules. Pre-treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.05μg/ml) increased ICAM-1 levels on cell surfaces and exaggerated the pro-osteogenic response to LFA-1, and neutralization of ICAM-1 suppressed this response. Further, ligation of ICAM-1 by antibody cross-linking also up-regulated BMP-2 expression. Interestingly, LFA-1 elicited Notch1 cleavage and NF-κB activation. Inhibition of NF-κB markedly reduced LFA-1-induced BMP-2 expression, and inhibition of Notch1 cleavage with a γ-secretase inhibitor suppressed LFA-1-induced NF-κB activation and BMP-2 expression. Ligation of ICAM-1 on human AVICs activates the Notch1 pathway. Notch1 up-regulates BMP-2 expression in human AVICs through activation of NF-κB. The results demonstrate a novel role of ICAM-1 in translating a pro-inflammatory signal into a pro-osteogenic response in human AVICs and suggest that ICAM-1 on the surfaces of AVICs contributes to the mechanism of aortic valve calcification.

Abstract: Complex organisms may coordinate molecular responses to hypoxia by specialized avenues of communication across multiple tissues, but these mechanisms are poorly understood. Plasma-based, extracellular microRNAs have been described, yet their regulation and biological functions in hypoxia remain enigmatic. We found a unique pattern of release of the hypoxia-inducible microRNA-210 (miR-210) from hypoxic and reoxygenated cells. This microRNA is also elevated in human plasma in physiologic and pathologic conditions of altered oxygen demand and delivery. Released miR-210 can be delivered to recipient cells, and the suppression of its direct target ISCU and mitochondrial metabolism is primarily evident in hypoxia. To regulate these hypoxia-specific actions, prolyl-hydroxylation of Argonaute 2 acts as a molecular switch that reciprocally modulates miR-210 release and intracellular activity in source cells as well as regulates intracellular activity in recipient cells after miR-210 delivery. Therefore, Argonaute 2-dependent control of released miR-210 represents a unique communication system that integrates the hypoxic response across anatomically distinct cells, preventing unnecessary activity of delivered miR-210 in normoxia while still preparing recipient tissues for incipient hypoxic stress and accelerating adaptation.

Abstract: Stringent negative regulation of the transcription factor NF-κB is essential for maintaining cellular stress responses and homeostasis. However, the tight regulation mechanisms of IKKβ are still not clear. Here, we reported that nemo-like kinase (NLK) is a suppressor of tumor necrosis factor (TNFα)-induced NF-κB signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKKβ. Overexpression of NLK largely blocked TNFα-induced NF-κB activation, p65 nuclear localization and IκBα degradation; whereas genetic inactivation of NLK showed opposing results. Mechanistically, we identified that NLK interacted with IκB kinase (IKK)-associated complex, which in turn inhibited the assembly of the TAK1/IKKβ and thereby, diminished the IκB kinase phosphorylation. Our results indicate that NLK functions as a pivotal negative regulator in TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB via disrupting the interaction of TAK1 with IKKβ.

Oleate prevents palmitate-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, insulin resistance and inflammatory signaling in neuronal cells,

Abstract: Elevated circulating levels of saturated free fatty acids (sFFAs; e.g. palmitate) are known to provoke inflammatory responses and cause insulin resistance in peripheral tissue. By contrast, mono- or poly-unsaturated FFAs are protective against sFFAs. An excess of sFFAs in the brain circulation may also trigger neuroinflammation and insulin resistance, however the underlying signaling changes have not been clarified in neuronal cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of palmitate on mitochondrial function and viability as well as on intracellular insulin and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways in Neuro-2a and primary rat cortical neurons. We next tested whether oleate preconditioning has a protective effect against palmitate-induced toxicity. Palmitate induced both mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance while promoting the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Oleate pre-exposure and then removal was sufficient to completely block subsequent palmitate-induced intracellular signaling and metabolic derangements. Oleate also prevented ceramide-induced insulin resistance. Moreover, oleate stimulated ATP while decreasing mitochondrial superoxide productions. The latter were associated with increased levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) attenuated the protective effect of oleate against palmitate, implicating PKA in the mechanism of oleate action. Oleate increased triglyceride and blocked palmitate-induced diacylglycerol accumulations. Oleate preconditioning was superior to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or linoleate in the protection of neuronal cells against palmitate- or ceramide-induced cytotoxicity. We conclude that oleate has beneficial properties against sFFA and ceramide models of insulin resistance-associated damage to neuronal cells.

PTPN13 regulates cellular signalling and β-catenin function during megakaryocytic differentiation,

Abstract: PTPN13 is a high-molecular weight intracellular phosphatase with several isoforms that exhibits a highly modular structure. Although in recent years different roles have been described for PTPN13, we are still far from understanding its function in cell biology. Here we show that PTPN13 expression is activated during megakaryocytic differentiation at the protein and mRNA level. Our results show that the upregulation of PTPN13 inhibits megakaryocytic differentiation, while PTPN13 silencing triggers differentiation. The ability of PTPN13 to alter megakaryocytic differentiation can be explained by its capacity to regulate ERK and STAT signalling. Interestingly, the silencing of β-catenin produced the same effect as PTPN13 downregulation. We demonstrate that both proteins coimmunoprecipitate and colocalise. Moreover, we provide evidence showing that PTPN13 can regulate β-catenin phosphorylation, stability and transcriptional activity. Therefore, the ability of PTPN13 to control megakaryocytic differentiation must be intimately linked to the regulation of β-catenin function. Moreover, our results show for the first time that PTPN13 is stabilised upon Wnt signalling, which makes PTPN13 an important player in canonical Wnt signalling. Our results show that PTPN13 behaves as an important regulator of megakaryocytic differentiation in cell lines and also in murine haematopoietic progenitors. This importance can be explained by the ability of PTPN13 to regulate cellular signalling, and especially through the regulation of β-catenin stability and function. Our results hold true for different megakaryocytic cell lines and also for haematopoietic progenitors, suggesting that these two proteins may play a relevant role during in vivo megakaryopoiesis.

Abstract: EPM1 is a rare progressive myoclonus epilepsy accompanied by apoptosis in the cerebellum of patients. Mutations in the gene of stefin B (cystatin B) are responsible for the primary defect underlying EPM1. Taking stefin B aggregates as a model we asked what comes first, protein aggregation or oxidative stress, and how these two processes correlate with cell death. We studied the aggregation in cells of the stefin B wild type, G4R mutant, and R68X fragment before (Ceru et al., 2010, Biol. Cell). The present study was performed on two more missense mutants of human stefin B, G50E and Q71P, and they similarly showed numerous aggregates upon overexpression. Mutant- and oligomer-dependent increase in oxidative stress and cell death in cells bearing aggregates was shown. On the other hand, there was no correlation between the size and number of the aggregates and cell death. We suggest that differences in toxicity of the aggregates depend on whether they are in oligomeric/protofibrillar or fibrillar form. This in turn likely depends on the mutant's 3D structure where unfolded proteins show lower toxicity. Imaging by transmission electron microscopy showed that the aggregates in cells are of different types: bigger perinuclear, surrounded by membranes and sometimes showing vesicle-like invaginations, or smaller, punctual and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. All EPM1 mutants studied were inactive as cysteine proteases inhibitors and in this way contribute to loss of stefin B functions. Relevance to EPM1 disease by gain in toxic function is discussed.

Abstract: Background
We recently reported that ER stress plays a key role in vascular endothelial dysfunction during hypertension. In this study we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms by which ER stress induction and oxidative stress impair vascular endothelial function.
Methodology/principal findings
We conducted in vitro studies with primary endothelial cells from coronary arteries stimulated with tunicamycin, 1μg/mL, in the presence or absence of two ER stress inhibitors: tauroursodeoxycholic acid (Tudca), 500μg/mL, and 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA), 5mM. ER stress induction was assessed by enhanced phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2α, and increased expression of CHOP, ATF6 and Grp78/Bip. The ER stress induction increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation, Nox2/4 mRNA levels and NADPH oxidase activity, and decreased eNOS promoter activity, eNOS expression and phosphorylation, and nitrite levels. Interestingly, the inhibition of p38 MAPK pathway reduced CHOP and Bip expressions enhanced by tunicamycin and restored eNOS promoter activation as well as phosphorylation. To study the effects of ER stress induction in vivo, we used C57BL/6J mice and p47phox−/− mice injected with tunicamycin or saline. The ER stress induction in mice significantly impaired vascular endothelium-dependent and independent relaxation in C57BL/6J mice compared with p47phox−/− mice indicating NADPH oxidase activity as an intermediate for ER stress in vascular endothelial dysfunction.
Conclusion/significance
We conclude that chemically induced ER stress leads to a downstream enhancement of p38 MAPK and oxidative stress causing vascular endothelial dysfunction. Our results indicate that inhibition of ER stress could be a novel therapeutic strategy to attenuate vascular dysfunction during cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Although cytokine-driven STAT3 phosphorylation and activation are often transient, persistent activation of STAT3 is a hallmark of a range of pathologies and underpins altered transcriptional responses. As triggers in disease frequently include combined increases in inflammatory cytokine and reactive oxygen species levels, we report here how oxidative stress impacts on cytokine-driven STAT3 signal transduction events. In the model system of murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), combined treatment with the interleukin-6 family cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) drove persistent STAT3 phosphorylation whereas STAT3 phosphorylation increased only transiently in response to LIF alone and was not increased by H2O2 alone. Surprisingly, increases in transcript levels of the direct STAT3 gene target SOCS3 were delayed during the combined LIF+H2O2 treatment, leading us to probe the impact of oxidative stress on STAT3 regulatory events. Indeed, LIF+H2O2 prolonged JAK activation, delayed STAT3 nuclear localisation, and caused relocalisation of nuclear STAT3 phosphatase TC-PTP (TC45) to the cytoplasm. In exploring the nuclear import/export pathways, we observed disruption of nuclear/cytoplasmic distributions of Ran and importin-α3 in cells exposed to H2O2 and the resultant reduced nuclear trafficking of classical importin-α/β-dependent protein cargoes. CRM1-mediated nuclear export persisted despite the oxidative stress insult, with sustained STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation enhancing STAT3 nuclear residency. Our studies thus reveal for the first time the striking impact of oxidative stress to sustain STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear retention following disruption of multiple regulatory events, with significant implications for STAT3 function.

Abstract: 58-kDa microspherule protein (MSP58) plays an important role in a variety of cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation. Currently, the mechanisms underlying the oncogenic effect of MSP58 are not fully understood. The human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene, which encodes an essential component for telomerase activity that is involved in cellular immortalization and transformation, is strictly regulated at the gene transcription level. Our previous study revealed a novel function of MSP58 in cellular senescence. Here we identify telomerase transcriptional element-interacting factor (TEIF) as a novel MSP58-interacting protein and determine the effect of MSP58 on hTERT transcription. This study thus provides evidence showing MSP58 to be a negative regulator of hTERT expression and telomerase activity. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that MSP58 could suppress the transcription of hTERT promoter. Additionally, stable overexpression of MSP58 protein in HT1080 and 293T cells decreased both endogenous hTERT expression and telomerase activity. Conversely, their upregulation was induced by MSP58 silencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that MSP58 binds to the hTERT proximal promoter. Furthermore, overexpression of MSP58 inhibited TEIF-mediated hTERT transactivation, telomerase activation, and cell proliferation promotion. The inhibitory effect of MSP58 occurred through inhibition of TEIF binding to DNA. Ultimately, the HT1080-implanted xenograft mouse model confirmed these cellular effects. Together, our findings provide new insights into both the biological function of MSP58 and the regulation of telomerase/hTERT expression.

Abstract: Transcription factor YY1 plays important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. For example, YY1 represses the expression of muscle-specific genes and the degradation of YY1 is required for myocyte differentiation. The activity of YY1 can be regulated by various post-translational modifications; however, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms for YY1 degradation. In this report, we attempted to identify potential E3 ubiquitin ligases for YY1, and found that Smurf2 E3 ubiquitin ligase can negatively regulate YY1 protein level, but not mRNA level. Smurf2 interacted with YY1, induced the poly-ubiquitination of YY1 and shortened the half-life of YY1 protein. Conversely, an E3 ubiquitin ligase-defective mutant form of Smurf2 or knockdown of Smurf2 increased YY1 protein level. PPxY motif is a typical target recognition site for Smurf2, and the PPxY motif in YY1 was important for Smurf2 interaction and Smurf2-induced degradation of YY1 protein. In addition, Smurf2 reduced the YY1-mediated activation of a YY1-responsive reporter whereas Smurf2 knockdown increased it. Finally, Smurf2 relieved the suppression of p53 activity by YY1. Taken together, our results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for YY1 function by Smurf2 in which the protein stability and transcriptional activity of YY1 are regulated by Smurf2 through the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of YY1.

ERα36 has been shown to mediate rapid, non-genomic, membrane-associated effects of 17β-estradiol in several cancer cell lines, including triple negative HCC38 breast cancer cells. Moreover, the effect is anti-apoptotic. The aim of this study was to determine if ERα36 mediates this anti-apoptotic effect, and to elucidate the mechanism involved. Taxol was used to induce apoptosis in HCC38 cells, and the effect of 17β-estradiol pre-treatment was determined. Antibodies to ERα36, signal pathway inhibitors, ERα36 deletion mutants, and ERα36-silencing were used prior to these treatments to determine the role of ERα36 in these effects and to determine which signaling molecules were involved. We found that the anti-apoptotic effect of 17β-estradiol in HCC38 breast cancer cells is in fact mediated by membrane-associated ERα36. We also showed that this signaling occurs through a pathway that requires PLD, LPA, and PI3K; Gαs and calcium signaling may also be involved. In addition, dynamic palmitoylation is required for the membrane-associated effect of 17β-estradiol. Exon 9 of ERα36, a unique exon to ERα36 not found in other identified splice variants of ERα with previously unknown function, is necessary for these effects. This study provides a working model for a mechanism by which estradiol promotes anti-apoptosis through membrane-associated ERα36, suggesting that ERα36 may be a potential membrane target for drug design against breast cancer, particularly triple negative breast cancer.

Abstract: Ki-1/57 (HABP4) and CGI-55 (SERBP1) are regulatory proteins and paralogs with 40.7% amino acid sequence identity and 67.4% similarity. Functionally, they have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression on both the transcriptional and mRNA metabolism levels. A link with tumorigenesis is suggested, since both paralogs show altered expression levels in tumor cells and the Ki-1/57 gene is found in a region of chromosome 9q that represents a haplotype for familiar colon cancer. However, the target genes regulated by Ki-1/57 and CGI-55 are unknown. Here, we analyzed the alterations of the global transcriptome profile after Ki-1/57 or CGI-55 overexpression in HEK293T cells by DNA microchip technology. We were able to identify 363 or 190 down-regulated and 50 or 27 up-regulated genes for Ki-1/57 and CGI-55, respectively, of which 20 were shared between both proteins. Expression levels of selected genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR both after protein overexpression and siRNA knockdown. The majority of the genes with altered expression were associated to proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle control processes, prompting us to further explore these contexts experimentally. We observed that overexpression of Ki-1/57 or CGI-55 results in reduced cell proliferation, mainly due to a G1 phase arrest, whereas siRNA knockdown of CGI-55 caused an increase in proliferation. In the case of Ki-1/57 overexpression, we found protection from apoptosis after treatment with the ER-stress inducer thapsigargin. Together, our data give important new insights that may help to explain these proteins putative involvement in tumorigenic events.

Abstract: The protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is irreversibly activated by either thrombin or metalloprotease 1. Due this irrevocable activation, activated internalization and degradation are critical for PAR1 signaling termination. Prohibitin (PHB) is an evolutionarily conserved, ubiquitously expressed, pleiotropic protein and belongs to the stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflK/C (SPFH) domain family. In a previous study, we found that PHB localized on the platelet membrane and participated in PAR1-mediated human platelet aggregation, suggesting that PHB likely regulates the signaling of PAR1. Unfortunately, PHB's exact function in PAR1 internalization and degradation is unclear. In the current study, flow cytometry revealed that PHB expressed on the surface of endothelial cells (HUVECs) but not cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). Further confocal microscopy revealed that PHB dynamically associates with PAR1 in a time-dependent manner following induction with PAR1-activated peptide (PAR1-AP), though differently between HUVECs and MDA-MB-231 cells. Depletion of PHB by RNA interference significantly inhibited PAR1 activated internalization and led to sustained Erk1/2 phosphorylation in the HUVECs; however, a similar effect was not observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. For both the endothelial and cancel cells, PHB repressed PAR1 degradation, while knockdown of PHB led to increased PAR1 degradation, and PHB overexpression inhibited PAR1 degradation. These results suggest that persistent PAR1 signaling due to the absence of membrane PHB and decreased PAR1 degradation caused by the upregulation of intracellular PHB in cancer cells (such as MDA-MB-231 cells) may render cells highly invasive. As such, PHB may be a novel target in future anti-cancer therapeutics, or in more refined cancer malignancy diagnostics.

Abstract: The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPases (SERCA) system, a key regulator of calcium cycling and signaling, is composed of several isoforms. We aimed to characterize the expression of SERCA isoforms in mouse cardiovascular tissues and their modulation in cardiovascular pathologies (heart failure and/or atherosclerosis). Five isoforms (SERCA2a, 2b, 3a, 3b and 3c) were detected in the mouse heart and thoracic aorta. Absolute mRNA quantification revealed SERCA2a as the dominant isoform in the heart (~99%). Both SERCA2 isoforms co-localized in cardiomyocytes (CM) longitudinal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), SERCA3b was located at the junctional SR. In the aorta, SERCA2a accounted for ~91% of total SERCA and SERCA2b for ~5%. Among SERCA3, SERCA3b was the most expressed (~3.3%), mainly found in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), along with SERCA2a and 2b. In failing CM, SERCA2a was down-regulated by 2-fold and re-localized from longitudinal to junctional SR. A strong down-regulation of SERCA2a was also observed in atherosclerotic vessels containing mainly synthetic VSMCs. The proportion of both SERCA2b and SERCA3b increased to 9.5% and 8.3%, respectively. In conclusion: 1) SERCA2a is the major isoform in both cardiac and vascular myocytes; 2) the expression of SERCA2a mRNA is ~30 fold higher in the heart compared to vascular tissues; and 3) nearly half the amount of SERCA2a mRNA is measured in both failing cardiomyocytes and synthetic VSMCs compared to healthy tissues, with a relocation of SERCA2a in failing cardiomyocytes. Thus, SERCA2a is the principal regulator of excitation–contraction coupling in both CMs and contractile VSMCs.

Abstract: Upregulation of Pin1 was shown to advance the functioning of several oncogenic pathways. It was recently shown that Pin1 is potentially an excellent prognostic marker and can also serve as a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of Pin1 overexpression in prostate cancer is still unclear. In the present study, we showed that the mRNA expression levels of Pin1 were not correlated with Pin1 protein levels in prostate cell lines which indicated that Pin1 may be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. A key player in post-transcriptional regulation is represented by microRNAs (miRNAs) that negatively regulate expressions of protein-coding genes at the post-transcriptional level. A bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-296-5p has a conserved binding site in the Pin1 3′-untranslated region (UTR). A luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that the seed region of miR-296-5p directly interacts with the 3′-UTR of Pin1 mRNA. Moreover, miR-296-5p expression was found to be inversely correlated with Pin1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and prostate cancer tissues. Furthermore, restoration of miR-296-5p or the knockdown of Pin1 had the same effect on the inhibition of the ability of cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of prostate cancer cell lines. Our results support miR-296-5p playing a tumor-suppressive role by targeting Pin1 and implicate potential effects of miR-296-5p on the prognosis and clinical application to prostate cancer therapy.

Abstract: Single particle tracking (SPT) of transmembrane receptors in the plasma membrane often reveals heterogeneous diffusion. A thorough interpretation of the displacements requires an extensive analysis suited for discrimination of different motion types present in the data. Here the diffusion pattern of the homomeric α3-containing glycine receptor (GlyR) is analyzed in the membrane of HEK 293 cells. More specifically, the influence of the α3 RNA splice variants α3K and α3L on lateral membrane diffusion of the receptor is revealed in detail. Using a combination of ensemble and local SPT analysis, free and anomalous diffusion parameters are determined. The GlyR α3 free diffusion coefficient is found to be 0.13±0.01μm2/s and both receptor variants display confined motion. The confinement probability level and residence time are significantly elevated for the α3L variant compared to the α3K variant. Furthermore, for the α3L GlyR, the presence of directed motion was also established, with a velocity matching that of saltatory vesicular transport. These findings reveal that α3 GlyRs are prone to different types of anomalous diffusion and reinforce the role of RNA splicing in determining lateral membrane trafficking.

Abstract: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) encoded by the ZC3H12a gene (also known as Regnase-1) is involved in the regulation of degradation of mRNA of inflammatory modulators and for processing of pre-miRNA. These functions depend on the presence of the PIN domain. Moreover, MCPIP1 was described as a negative regulator of NF-κB and AP-1 signaling pathways although mechanisms underlying such activity remain unknown. We aimed at determining the role of MCPIP1 in adipogenesis. Here, we present evidence that Mcpip1 transcription is transiently activated during 3T3-L1 transition from pre- to adipocytes. However Mcpip1 protein expression is also strongly decreased at day one after induction of adipogenesis. Knockdown of Mcpip1 results in an upregulation of C/EBPβ and PPARγ mRNAs, whereas overexpression of MCPIP1 reduces the level of both transcription factors and impairs adipogenesis. MCPIP1-dependend modulation of C/EBPβ and PPARγ levels results in a modulation of the expression of downstream controlled genes. In addition, decreased C/EBPβ, but not PPARγ, depends on the activity of the MCPIP1 PIN domain, which is responsible for RNase properties of this protein. Together, these data confirm that MCPIP1 is a key regulator of adipogenesis.

Abstract: Autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease is most often caused by mutations in the genes encoding the cytosolic E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin and the mitochondrial serine/threonine kinase PINK1. Studies in Drosophila models and mammalian cells have demonstrated that these proteins regulate various aspects of mitochondrial physiology, including organelle transport, dynamics and turnover. How PINK1 and Parkin orchestrate these processes, and whether they always do so within a common pathway remain to be clarified. We have revisited the role of PINK1 and Parkin in mitochondrial dynamics, and explored its relation to the mitochondrial clearance program controlled by these proteins. We show that PINK1 and Parkin promote Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission by mechanisms that are at least in part independent. Parkin-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation was abolished by treatments interfering with the calcium/calmodulin/calcineurin signaling pathway, suggesting that it requires dephosphorylation of serine 637 of Drp1. Parkinson's disease-causing mutations with differential impact on mitochondrial morphology and organelle degradation demonstrated that the pro-fission effect of Parkin is not required for efficient mitochondrial clearance. In contrast, the use of Förster energy transfer imaging microscopy revealed that Drp1 and Parkin are co-recruited to mitochondria in proximity of PINK1 following mitochondrial depolarization, indicating spatial coordination between these events in mitochondrial degradation. Our results also hint at a major role of the outer mitochondrial adaptor MiD51 in Drp1 recruitment and Parkin-dependent mitophagy. Altogether, our observations provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by Parkin and its relation to the mitochondrial clearance program mediated by the PINK1/Parkin pathway.

Abstract: NOTCH receptors regulate cell proliferation and survival in several types of cancer cells. Depending on the cellular context, NOTCH1 can function as an oncogene or as a tumor suppressor gene. DLK1 is also involved in the regulation of cell growth and cancer, but nothing is known about the role of DLK2 in these processes. Recently, the proteins DLK1 and DLK2 have been reported to interact with NOTCH1 and to inhibit NOTCH1 activation and signaling in different cell lines. In this work, we focused on the role of DLK proteins in the control of melanoma cell growth, where NOTCH1 is known to exert an oncogenic effect. We found that human DLK proteins inhibit NOTCH signaling in SK-MEL-2 metastatic melanoma cells. Moreover, the proliferation rate of these cells was dependent upon the level of NOTCH activation and signaling as regulated by DLK proteins. In particular, high levels of NOTCH inhibition resulted in a decrease, whereas lower levels of NOTCH inhibition led to an increase in melanoma cell proliferation rates, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, our data revealed additive NOTCH-mediated effects of DLK proteins and the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT on cell proliferation. The data presented in this work suggest that a fine regulation of NOTCH signaling plays an important role in the control of metastatic melanoma cell proliferation. Our results open the way to new research on the role of DLK proteins as potential therapeutic tools for the treatment of human melanoma.

Abstract: HMG-CoA reductase, the proximal rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, is inhibited by statins. Beyond their cholesterol lowering impact, statins have pleiotropic effects and their use is linked to improved lung health. We have shown that mevalonate cascade inhibition induces apoptosis and autophagy in cultured human airway mesenchymal cells. Here, we show that simvastatin also induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in these cells. We tested whether coordination of ER stress, autophagy and apoptosis determines survival or demise of human lung mesenchymal cells exposed to statin. We observed that simvastatin exposure activates UPR (activated transcription factor 4, activated transcription factor 6 and IRE1α) and caspase-4 in primary human airway fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. Exogenous mevalonate inhibited apoptosis, autophagy and UPR, but exogenous cholesterol was without impact, indicating that sterol intermediates are involved with mechanisms mediating statin effects. Caspase-4 inhibition decreased simvastatin-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of autophagy by ATG7 or ATG3 knockdown significantly increased cell death. In BAX−/−/BAK−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts, simvastatin-triggered apoptotic and UPR events were abrogated, but autophagy flux was increased leading to cell death via necrosis. Our data indicate that mevalonate cascade inhibition, likely associated with depletion of sterol intermediates, can lead to cell death via coordinated apoptosis, autophagy, and ER stress. The interplay between these pathways appears to be principally regulated by autophagy and Bcl-2-family pro-apoptotic proteins. These findings uncover multiple mechanisms of action of statins that could contribute to refining the use of such agent in treatment of lung disease.

Abstract: The glucose phosphorylating enzyme glucokinase regulates glucose metabolism in the liver. Glucokinase activity is modulated by a liver-specific competitive inhibitor, the glucokinase regulatory protein (GRP), which mediates sequestration of glucokinase to the nucleus at low glucose concentrations. However, the mechanism of glucokinase nuclear export is not fully understood. In this study we investigated the dynamics of glucose-dependent interaction and translocation of glucokinase and GRP in primary hepatocytes using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, selective photoconversion and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The formation of the glucokinase:GRP complex in the nucleus of primary hepatocytes at 5mmol/l glucose was significantly reduced after a 2h incubation at 20mmol/l glucose. The GRP was predominantly localized in the nucleus, but a mobile fraction moved between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The glucose concentration only marginally affected GRP shuttling. In contrast, the nuclear export rate of glucokinase was significantly higher at 20 than at 5mmol/l glucose. Thus, glucose was proven to be the driving-force for nuclear export of glucokinase in hepatocytes. Using the FLII12Pglu-700μ-δ6 glucose nanosensor it could be shown that in hepatocytes the kinetics of nuclear glucose influx, metabolism or efflux were significantly faster compared to insulin-secreting cells. The rapid equilibration kinetics of glucose flux into the nucleus facilitates dissociation of the glucokinase:GRP complex and also nuclear glucose metabolism by free glucokinase enzyme. In conclusion, we could show that a rise of glucose in the nucleus of hepatocytes releases active glucokinase from the glucokinase:GRP complex and promotes the subsequent nuclear export of glucokinase.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle formation is a multistep process involving proliferation, differentiation, alignment and fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes which fuse with additional myoblast to form myofibers. Toca-1 (Transducer of Cdc42-dependent actin assembly), is an adaptor protein which activates N-WASP in conjunction with Cdc42 to facilitate membrane invagination, endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Expression of Toca-1 in mouse primary myoblasts and C2C12 myoblasts was up-regulated on day 1 of differentiation and subsequently down-regulated during differentiation. Knocking down Toca-1 expression in C2C12 cells (Toca-1KD cells) resulted in a significant decrease in myotube formation and expression of shRNA-resistant Toca-1 in Toca-1KD cells rescued the myogenic defect, suggesting that the knockdown was specific and Toca-1 is essential for myotube formation. Toca-1KD cells exhibited elongated spindle-like morphology, expressed myogenic markers (MyoD and MyHC) and localized N-Cadherin at cell periphery similar to control cells suggesting that Toca-1 is not essential for morphological changes or expression of proteins critical for differentiation. Toca-1KD cells displayed prominent actin fibers suggesting a defect in actin cytoskeleton turnover necessary for cell–cell fusion. Toca-1KD cells migrated faster than control cells and had a reduced number of vinculin patches similar to N-WASPKO MEF cells. Transfection of N-WASP-expressing plasmid into Toca-1KD cells restored myotube formation of Toca-1KD cells. Thus, our results suggest that Toca-1KD cells have defects in formation of myotubes probably due to reduced activity of actin cytoskeleton regulators such as N-WASP. This is the first study to identify and characterize the role of Toca-1 in myogenesis.

Abstract: The role of protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1P1) phosphorylation was studied. Activation of S1P1 receptors induced an immediate increase in intracellular calcium, which was blocked by preincubation with PMA. Both S1P and PMA were able to increase S1P1 phosphorylation in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. Down-regulation of PKC (overnight incubation with PMA) blocked the subsequent effect of the phorbol ester on S1P1 phosphorylation, without decreasing that of the natural agonist. Pharmacological inhibition of PKC α prevented the effects of PMA on S1P-triggered intracellular calcium increase and on S1P1 phosphorylation; no such effect was observed on the effects of the sphingolipid agonist. The presence of PKC α and β isoforms in S1P1 immunoprecipitates was evidenced by Western blotting. Additionally, expression of dominant-negative mutants of PKC α or β and knockdown of these isozymes using short hairpin RNA, markedly attenuated PMA-induced S1P1 phosphorylation. Our results indicate that the classical isoforms, mainly PKC α, mediate PMA-induced phosphorylation and desensitization of S1P1.

Abstract: Endothelial cells in the vascular system are constantly subjected to the frictional force of shear stress due to the pulsatile nature of blood flow. Although several proteins form part of the shear stress mechano-sensing pathway, the identification of mechano-transducing pathways is largely unknown. Given the increasing evidence for a signaling function of mitochondria in endothelial cells, the aim of this study was to investigate their role as mechano-sensor organelles during laminar shear stress (LSS). We demonstrated that LSS activates intracellular signaling pathways that modulate not only mitochondrial dynamics but also mitochondrial function. At early time points of LSS, the fission-related protein Drp1 was recruited from the cytosol to mitochondria and activated mitochondrial fission. LSS-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was indispensable for mitochondrial fission. As alterations in mitochondrial dynamics have been related to changes in bioenergetics profiles, we studied mitochondrial function after LSS. We found that LSS decreased respiration rate, increased mitochondrial membrane potential and promoted the mitochondrial generation of ROS with the subsequent oxidation and activation of the antioxidant enzyme PRX3. Our data support a novel and active role for mitochondria in endothelial cells as active players, able to transduce the mechanical force of shear stress in the vascular endothelium into a biological response.

Abstract: Glucokinase activity is a major determinant of hepatic glucose metabolism and blood glucose homeostasis. Liver glucokinase activity is regulated acutely by adaptive translocation between the nucleus and the cytoplasm through binding and dissociation from its regulatory protein (GKRP) in the nucleus. Whilst the effect of glucose on this mechanism is well established, the role of hormones in regulating glucokinase location and its interaction with binding proteins remains unsettled. Here we show that treatment of rat hepatocytes with 25mM glucose caused decreased binding of glucokinase to GKRP, translocation from the nucleus and increased binding to 6-phosphofructo 2-kinase/fructose 2,6 bisphosphatase-2 (PFK2/FBPase2) in the cytoplasm. Glucagon caused dissociation of glucokinase from PFK2/FBPase2, concomitant with phosphorylation of PFK2/FBPase2 on Ser-32, uptake of glucokinase into the nucleus and increased interaction with GKRP. Two novel glucagon receptor antagonists attenuated the action of glucagon. This establishes an unequivocal role for hormonal control of glucokinase translocation. Given that glucagon excess contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes, glucagon may play a role in the defect in glucokinase translocation and activity evident in animal models and human diabetes.

Abstract: Bacteriocins are a diverse group of ribosomally synthesized protein antibiotics produced by most bacteria. They range from small lanthipeptides produced by lactic acid bacteria to much larger multi domain proteins of Gram negative bacteria such as the colicins from Escherichia coli. For activity bacteriocins must be released from the producing cell and then bind to the surface of a sensitive cell to instigate the import process leading to cell death. For over 50years, colicins have provided a working platform for elucidating the structure/function studies of bacteriocin import and modes of action. An understanding of the processes that contribute to the delivery of a colicin molecule across two lipid membranes of the cell envelope has advanced our knowledge of protein–protein interactions (PPI), protein–lipid interactions and the role of order–disorder transitions of protein domains pertinent to protein transport. In this review, we provide an overview of the arrangement of genes that controls the synthesis and release of the mature protein. We examine the uptake processes of colicins from initial binding and sequestration of binding partners to crossing of the outer membrane, and then discuss the translocation of colicins through the cell periplasm and across the inner membrane to their cytotoxic site of action.

Abstract: Leukocyte Elastase Inhibitor (LEI, also called serpin B1) is a protein involved in apoptosis among other physiological processes. We have previously shown that upon cleavage by its cognate protease, LEI is transformed into L-DNase II, a protein with a pro-apoptotic activity. The caspase independent apoptotic pathway, in which L-DNase II is the final effector, interacts with other pro-apoptotic molecules like Poly-ADP-Ribose polymerase (PARP) or Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF). The screening of LEI/L-DNase II interactions showed a possible interaction with several members of the BCL-2 family of proteins which are known to have a central role in the regulation of caspase dependent cell death. In this study, we investigated the regulation of LEI/L-DNase II pathway by two members of this family of proteins: BAX and BCL-2, which have opposite effects on cell survival. We show that, in both BHK and HeLa cells, LEI/L-DNase II can interact with BCL-2 and BAX in apoptotic and non-apoptotic conditions. These proteins which are usually thought to be anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic respectively, both inhibit the L-DNase II pro-apoptotic activity. These results give further insight in the regulation of caspase independent pathways and highlight the involvement of the intracellular environment of a given protein in the determinism of its function. They also add a link between caspase-dependent and independent pathways of apoptosis.

Abstract: Wnt5a and 1α,25(OH)2D3 are important regulators of endochondral ossification. In osteoblasts and growth plate chondrocytes, 1α,25(OH)2D3 initiates rapid effects via its membrane-associated receptor protein disulfide isomerase A3 (Pdia3) in caveolae, activating phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-activating protein (PLAA), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and PLA2, resulting in protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Wnt5a initiates its calcium-dependent effects via intracellular calcium release, activating PKC and CaMKII. We investigated the requirement for components of the Pdia3 receptor complex in Wnt5a calcium-dependent signaling. We determined that Wnt5a signals through a CaMKII/PLA2/PGE2/PKC cascade. Silencing or blocking Pdia3, PLAA, or vitamin D receptor (VDR), and inhibition of calmodulin (CaM), CaMKII, or PLA2 inhibited Wnt5a-induced PKC activity. Wnt5a activated PKC in caveolin-1-silenced cells, but methyl-beta-cyclodextrin reduced its stimulatory effect. 1α,25(OH)2D3 reduced stimulatory effects of Wnt5a on PKC in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, Wnt5a had a biphasic effect on 1α,25(OH)2D3-stimulated PKC activation; 50ng/ml Wnt5a caused a 2-fold increase in 1α,25(OH)2D3-stimulated PKC but higher Wnt5a concentrations reduced 1α,25(OH)2D3-stimulated PKC activation. Western blots showed that Wnt receptors Frizzled2 (FZD2) and Frizzled5 (FZD5), and receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) were localized to caveolae. Blocking ROR2, but not FZD2 or FZD5, abolished the stimulatory effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on PKC and CaMKII. 1α,25(OH)2D3 membrane receptor complex components (Pdia3, PLAA, caveolin-1, CaM) interacted with Wnt5a receptors/co-receptors (ROR2, FZD2, FZD5) in immunoprecipitation studies, interactions that changed with either 1α,25(OH)2D3 or Wnt5a treatment. This study demonstrates that 1α,25(OH)2D3 and Wnt5a mediate their effects via similar receptor components and suggests that these pathways may interact.

Abstract: Cysteine-rich protein 61 (CCN1/CYR61) is a CCN (CYR61, CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), and NOV (Nephroblastoma overexpressed gene)) family matricellular protein comprising six secreted CCN proteins in mammals. CCN1/CYR61 expression is associated with inflammation and injury repair. Recent studies show that CCN1/CYR61 limits fibrosis in models of cutaneous wound healing by inducing cellular senescence in myofibroblasts of the granulation tissue which thereby transforms into an extracellular matrix-degrading phenotype. We here investigate CCN1/CYR61 expression in primary profibrogenic liver cells (i.e., hepatic stellate cells and periportal myofibroblasts) and found an increase of CCN1/CYR61 expression during early activation of hepatic stellate cells that declines in fully transdifferentiated myofibroblasts. By contrast, CCN1/CYR61 levels found in primary parenchymal liver cells (i.e., hepatocytes) were relatively low compared to the levels exhibited in hepatic stellate cells and portal myofibroblasts. In models of ongoing liver fibrogenesis, elevated levels of CCN1/CYR61 were particularly noticed during early periods of insult, while expression declined during prolonged phases of fibrogenesis. We generated an adenovirus type 5 encoding CCN1/CYR61 (i.e., Ad5-CMV-CCN1/CYR61) and overexpressed CCN1/CYR61 in primary portal myofibroblasts. Interestingly, overexpressed CCN1/CYR61 significantly inhibited production of collagen type I at both mRNA and protein levels as evidenced by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot and immunocytochemistry. CCN1/CYR61 further induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to dose-dependent cellular senescence and apoptosis. Additionally, we demonstrate that CCN1/CYR61 attenuates TGF-β signaling by scavenging TGF-β thereby mitigating in vivo liver fibrogenesis in a bile duct ligation model. Conclusion: In line with dermal fibrosis and scar formation, CCN1/CYR61 is involved in liver injury repair and tissue remodeling. CCN1/CYR61 gene transfer into extracellular matrix-producing liver cells is therefore potentially beneficial in liver fibrotic therapy.

Mechanism of cleavage of alpha-synuclein by the 20S proteasome and modulation of its degradation by the RedOx state of the N-terminal methionines,

Abstract: Alpha-synuclein is a small protein implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). We have investigated the mechanism of cleavage of alpha-synuclein by the 20S proteasome. Alpha-synuclein interacts with the C8 (α7) subunit of the proteasome. The N-terminal part of alpha-synuclein (amino acids 1–60) is essential for its proteasomal degradation and analysis of peptides released from proteasomal digestion allows concluding that initial cleavages occur within the N-terminal region of the molecule. Aggregated alpha-synucleins are also degraded by the proteasome with a reduced rate, likely due to Met oxidation. In fact, mild oxidation of alpha-synuclein with H2O2 resulted in the inhibition of its degradation by the proteasome, mainly due to oxidation of Met 1 and 5 of alpha-synuclein. The inhibition was reversed by treatment of the oxidized protein with methionine sulfoxide reductases (MsrA plus MsrB). Similarly, treatment with H2O2 of N2A cells transfected with alpha-synuclein resulted in the inhibition of its degradation that was also reverted by co-transfection of MsrA plus MsrB. These results clearly indicate that oxidative stress, a common feature of PD and other synucleinopathies, promotes a RedOx change in the proteostasis of alpha-synuclein due to Met oxidation and reduced proteasomal degradation; compromised reversion of those oxidative changes would result in the accumulation of oxidative damaged alpha-synuclein likely contributing to the pathogenesis of PD.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) behave as second messengers in signal transduction for a series of receptor/ligand interactions. A major regulatory role is played by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), more stable and able to freely diffuse through cell membranes. Copper–zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD)-1 is a cytosolic enzyme involved in scavenging oxygen radicals to H2O2 and molecular oxygen, thus representing a major cytosolic source of peroxides. Previous studies suggested that superoxide anion and H2O2 generation are involved in T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent signaling. Here, we describe that antigen-dependent activation of human T lymphocytes significantly increased extracellular SOD-1 levels in lymphocyte cultures. This effect was accompanied by the synthesis of SOD-1-specific mRNA and by the induction of microvesicle SOD-1 secretion. It is of note that SOD-1 increased its concentration specifically in T cell population, while no significant changes were observed in the “non-T” cell counterpart. Moreover, confocal microscopy showed that antigen-dependent activation was able to modify SOD-1 intracellular localization in T cells. Indeed, was observed a clear SOD-1 recruitment by TCR clusters. The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited this phenomenon. Further studies are needed to define whether SOD-1-dependent superoxide/peroxide balance is relevant for regulation of T cell activation, as well as in the functional cross talk between immune effectors.

Abstract: RNA-binding motif protein 4 (RBM4) reportedly reprograms the tissue-specific splicing network which modulates the development of muscles and pancreatic β-islets. Herein, we report that Rbm4a−/− mice exhibited hyperlipidemia accompanied with reduced mass of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT). Elevated RBM4a led to the isoform shift of IR, Ppar-γ, and Pref-1 genes which play pivotal roles in the different stages of adipogenesis. Overexpression of RBM4a enhanced the mitochondrial activity of brown adipocyte-like lineage in the presence of uncoupling agent. RBM4a-ablated adipocytes inversely exhibited impaired development and inefficient energy expenditure. Intriguingly, overexpressed RBM4a induced the expression of brown adipocyte-specific factors (Prdm16 and Bmp7) in white adipocyte-like lineage, which suggested the potential action of RBM4a on the white-to-brown trans-differentiation of adipocytes. In differentiating adipocytes, RBM4a constituted a feed-forward circuit through autoregulating the splicing pattern of its own transcript. Based on these results, we propose the emerging role of RBM4 in regulating the adipocyte-specific splicing events and transcription cascade, which subsequently facilitate the development and function of brown adipocyte-like cells.

Abstract: A study is presented on the expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes in exponentially growing and serum-starved, quiescent human fibroblast cultures. The functional levels of respiratory complexes I and III and complex V (adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase) were found to be severely depressed in serum-starved fibroblasts. The depression of oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) complexes was associated with reduced levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and the down-stream nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and mitochondrial transcription factors (TFAM). In serum-starved fibroblasts decrease of the catalytic activity of AMP cyclic dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), the transcription coactivator of the PGC-1α gene, was found. Hydroxytyrosol prevented the decline in the expression of the PGC-1α transcription cascade of OXPHOS complexes in serum-starved fibroblast cultures. The positive effect of HT was associated with activation of PKA and CREB phosphorylation. These results show involvement of PKA, CREB and PGC-1α in the regulation of OXPHOS in cell transition from the replicating to the quiescent state.

Abstract: Selenoprotein W (SelW) is expressed in various tissues, particularly in skeletal muscle. We have previously reported that SelW is up-regulated during C2C12 skeletal muscle differentiation and inhibits binding of 14-3-3 to its target proteins. 14-3-3 reduces myogenic differentiation by inhibiting nuclear translocation of transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Phosphorylation of TAZ at Ser89 is required for binding to 14-3-3, leading to cytoplasmic retention of TAZ and a delay in myogenic differentiation. Here, we show that myogenic differentiation was delayed in SelW-knockdown C2C12 cells. Down-regulation of SelW also increased TAZ binding to 14-3-3, which eventually resulted in decreasing translocation of TAZ to the nucleus. However, phosphorylation of TAZ at Ser89 was not affected. Although phosphorylation of TAZ at Ser89 was sustained by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, nuclear translocation of TAZ was increased by ectopic expression of SelW. This result was due to decreased binding of TAZ to 14-3-3. We also found that the interaction between TAZ and MyoD was increased by ectopic expression of SelW. Taken together, these findings strongly demonstrate that SelW enhances C2C12 cell differentiation by inhibiting TAZ binding to 14-3-3.

Abstract: Notch4 is a divergent member of the Notch family of receptors that is primarily expressed in the vasculature. Its expression implies an important role for Notch4 in the vasculature; however, mice homozygous for the Notch4d1 knockout allele are viable. Since little is known about the role of Notch4 in the vasculature and how it functions, we further investigated Notch4 in mice and in cultured cells. We found that the Notch4d1 allele is not null as it expresses a truncated transcript encoding most of the NOTCH4 extracellular domain. In cultured cells, NOTCH4 did not signal in response to ligand. Moreover, NOTCH4 inhibited signalling from the NOTCH1 receptor. This is the first report of cis-inhibition of signalling by another Notch receptor. The NOTCH4 extracellular domain also inhibits NOTCH1 signalling when expressed in cis, raising the possibility that reported Notch4 phenotypes may not be due to loss of NOTCH4 function. To better address the role of NOTCH4 in vivo, we generated a Notch4 null mouse in which the entire coding region was deleted. Notch4 null mice exhibited slightly delayed vessel growth in the retina, consistent with our novel finding that NOTCH4 protein is expressed in the newly formed vasculature. These findings indicate a role of NOTCH4 in fine-tuning the forming vascular plexus.

Abstract: SUMOylation, a posttranslational modification of proteins, has been recently described as vital in eukaryotic cells. In a previous work, we analyzed the role of SUMO protein and the genes encoding the putative enzymes of the SUMOylation pathway in the parasite Giardia lamblia. Although we observed several SUMOylated proteins, only the enzyme Arginine Deiminase (ADI) was confirmed as a SUMOylated substrate. ADI is involved in the survival of the parasite and, besides its role in ATP production, it also catalyzes the modification of arginine residues to citrulline in the cytoplasmic tail of surface proteins. During encystation, however, ADI translocates to the nuclei and downregulates the expression of the Cyst Wall Protein 2 (CWP2). In this work, we made site-specific mutation of the ADI SUMOylation site (Lys101) and observed that transgenic trophozoites did not translocate to the nuclei at the first steps of encystation but shuttled in the nuclei late during this process through classic nuclear localization signals. Inside the nuclei, ADI acts as a peptidyl arginine deiminase, being probably involved in the downregulation of CWPs expression and cyst wall formation. Our results strongly indicate that ADI plays a regulatory role during encystation in which posttranslational modifications of proteins are key players.

Abstract: Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a chemoattractant and inducer for neural stem/progenitor (NS/P) cell migration. Although the type II transmembrane serine protease, matriptase (MTP) is an activator of the latent HGF, MTP is indispensable on NS/P cell motility induced by the active form of HGF. This suggests that MTP's action on NS/P cell motility involves mechanisms other than proteolytic activation of HGF. In the present study, we investigate the role of MTP in HGF-stimulated signaling events. Using specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt) or focal adhesion kinase (FAK), we demonstrated that in NS/P cells HGF-activated c-Met induces PI3k-Akt signaling which then leads to FAK activation. This signaling pathway ultimately induces MMP2 expression and NS/P cell motility. Knocking down of MTP in NS/P cells with specific siRNA impaired HGF-stimulation of c-Met, Akt and FAK activation, blocked HGF-induced production of MMP2 and inhibited HGF-stimulated NS/P cell motility. MTP-knockdown NS/P cells cultured in the presence of recombinant protein of MTP protease domain or transfected with the full-length wild-type but not the protease-defected MTP restored HGF-responsive events in NS/P cells. In addition to functioning as HGF activator, our data revealed novel function of MTP on HGF-stimulated c-Met signaling activation.

Abstract: The Tat system transports folded proteins across the bacterial plasma membrane. The mechanism is believed to involve coalescence of a TatC-containing unit with a separate TatA complex, but the full translocation complex has never been visualised and the assembly process is poorly defined. We report the analysis of the Bacillus subtilis TatAyCy system, which occurs as separate TatAyCy and TatAy complexes at steady state, using single-particle electron microscopy (EM) and advanced atomic force microscopy (AFM) approaches. We show that a P2A mutation in the TatAy subunit leads to apparent super-assembly of Tat complexes. Purification of TatCy-containing complexes leads to a large increase in the TatA:TatC ratio, suggesting that TatAyP2A complexes may have attached to the TatAyCy complex. EM and AFM analyses show that the wild-type TatAyCy complex purifies as roughly spherical complexes of 9–16nm diameter, whereas the P2A mutation leads to accumulation of large (up to 500nm long) fibrils that are chains of numerous complexes. Time lapsed AFM imaging, recorded on fibrils under liquid, shows that they adopt a variety of tightly curved conformations, with radii of curvature of 10–12nm comparable to the size of single TatAyP2A complexes. The combined data indicate that the mutation leads to super-assembly of TatAyP2A complexes and we propose that an individual TatAyP2A complex assembles initially with a TatAyP2ACy complex, after which further TatAyP2A complexes attach to each other. The data further suggest that the N-terminal extracytoplasmic domain of TatAy plays an essential role in Tat complex interactions.

Abstract: VDAC1, an outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein, is crucial for regulating mitochondrial metabolic and energetic functions and acts as a convergence point for various cell survival and death signals. VDAC1 is also a key player in apoptosis, involved in cytochrome c (Cyto c) release and interactions with anti-apoptotic proteins. Recently, we demonstrated that various pro-apoptotic agents induce VDAC1 oligomerization and proposed that a channel formed by VDAC1 oligomers mediates cytochrome c release. As VDAC1 transports Ca2+ across the OMM and because Ca2+ has been implicated in apoptosis induction, we addressed the relationship between cytosolic Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i), VDAC1 oligomerization and apoptosis induction. We demonstrate that different apoptosis inducers elevate cytosolic Ca2+ and induce VDAC1 over-expression. Direct elevation of [Ca2+]i by the Ca2+-mobilizing agents A23187, ionomycin and thapsigargin also resulted in VDAC1 over-expression, VDAC1 oligomerization and apoptosis. In contrast, decreasing [Ca2+]i using the cell-permeable Ca2+-chelating reagent BAPTA-AM inhibited VDAC1 over-expression, VDAC1 oligomerization and apoptosis. Correlation between the increase in VDAC1 levels and oligomerization, [Ca2+]i levels and apoptosis induction, as induced by H2O2 or As2O3, was also obtained. On the other hand, cells transfected to overexpress VDAC1 presented Ca2+-independent VDAC1 oligomerization, cytochrome c release and apoptosis, suggesting that [Ca2+]i elevation is not a pre-requisite for apoptosis induction when VDAC1 is over-expressed. The results suggest that Ca2+ promotes VDAC1 over-expression by an as yet unknown signaling pathway, leading to VDAC1 oligomerization, ultimately resulting in apoptosis. These findings provide a new insight into the mechanism of action of existing anti-cancer drugs involving induction of VDAC1 over-expression as a mechanism for inducing apoptosis.

Abstract: Cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer immense value in studying cardiovascular regenerative medicine. However, intrinsic biases and differential responsiveness of hPSCs towards cardiac differentiation pose significant technical and logistic hurdles that hamper human cardiomyocyte studies. Tandem modulation of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways may play a crucial role in cardiac development that can efficiently generate cardiomyocytes from pluripotent stem cells. Our Wnt signaling expression profiles revealed that phasic modulation of canonical/non-canonical axis enabled orderly recapitulation of cardiac developmental ontogeny. Moreover, evaluation of 8 hPSC lines showed marked commitment towards cardiac-mesoderm during the early phase of differentiation, with elevated levels of canonical Wnts (Wnt3 and 3a) and Mesp1. Whereas continued activation of canonical Wnts was counterproductive, its discrete inhibition during the later phase of cardiac differentiation was accompanied by significant up-regulation of non-canonical Wnt expression (Wnt5a and 11) and enhanced Nkx2.5+ (up to 98%) populations. These Nkx2.5+ populations transited to contracting cardiac troponin T-positive CMs with up to 80% efficiency. Our results suggest that timely modulation of Wnt pathways would transcend intrinsic differentiation biases of hPSCs to consistently generate functional CMs that could facilitate their scalable production for meaningful clinical translation towards personalized regenerative medicine.

Abstract: Apoptosis is essential in the death process induced by Amyloid-β (Aβ), a major constituent of diffuse plaques found in Alzheimer's disease patients. However, we have found that caspase activation and cell death induced by staurosporine, employed to induce the intrinsic mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway, were significantly reduced by 42 amino-acid Aβ42, implying that the peptide also has a negative effect on the apoptotic process. The inhibitory effect of Aβ42 on the apoptotic pathway is associated with its interaction with procaspase-9 and consequent inhibition of Apaf-1 apoptosome assembly. We detected the inhibitory effect in the early stage (<8h) of apoptosis, but later caspase activation becomes obvious. Thus we inferred that the inhibitory process on apoptosis begins at an early stage, and the later robust activation surpasses it. We propose that the apoptotic manifestation in Aβ-treated cells is a combined consequence of those anti- and pro-apoptotic processes.

Abstract: The alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors are important glutamatergic receptors mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. The regulation of the four subunits of AMPA receptors, GluA1-4, is poorly understood. Excitatory synaptic transmission is highly energy-demanding, and this energy is derived mainly from the oxidative pathway. Recently, we found that specificity factor regulates all subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a critical energy-generating enzyme. COX is also regulated by nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), which transcriptionally controls the Gria2 (GluA2) gene of AMPA receptors. The goal of the present study was to test our hypothesis that Sp-factors (Sp1, Sp3, and/or Sp4) also regulate AMPA subunit genes. If so, we wish to determine if Sp-factors and NRF-1 function via a complementary, concurrent and parallel, or a combination of complementary and concurrent/parallel mechanism. By means of multiple approaches, including electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, promoter mutations, real-time quantitative PCR, and western blot analysis, we found that Sp4, but not Sp1 or Sp3, regulates the Gria2, but not Gria1, 3, or 4, subunit gene of the AMPA receptor in a concurrent and parallel manner with NRF-1. Thus, Sp4 and NRF-1 both mediate the tight coupling between neuronal activity and energy metabolism at the transcriptional level.

Abstract: Chaperones are critical for the folding and regulation of a wide array of cellular proteins. Heat Shock Proteins (Hsps) are the most representative group of chaperones. Hsp90 represents up to 1–2% of soluble protein. Although the Hsp90 role is being studied in neurodegenerative diseases, its role in neuronal differentiation remains mostly unknown. Since neuronal polarity mechanisms depend on local stability and degradation, we asked whether Hsp90 could be a regulator of axonal polarity and growth. Thus, we studied the role of Hsp90 activity in a well established model of cultured hippocampal neurons using an Hsp90 specific inhibitor, 17-AAG. Our present data shows that Hsp90 inhibition at different developmental stages disturbs neuronal polarity formation or axonal elongation. Hsp90 inhibition during the first 3h in culture promotes multiple axon morphology, while this inhibition after 3h slows down axonal elongation. Hsp90 inhibition was accompanied by decreased Akt and GSK3 expression, as well as, a reduced Akt activity. In parallel, we detected an alteration of kinesin-1 subcellular distribution. Moreover, these effects were seconded by changes in Hsp70/Hsc70 subcellular localization that seem to compensate the lack of Hsp90 activity. In conclusion, our data strongly suggests that Hsp90 activity is necessary to control the expression, activity or location of specific kinases and motor proteins during the axon specification and axon elongation processes. Even more, our data demonstrate the existence of a “time-window” for axon specification in this model of cultured neurons after which the inhibition of Hsp90 only affects axonal elongation mechanisms.

Abstract: CXCL12 and its unique receptor CXCR4, is critical for the homing of a variety of cell lineages during both development and tissue repair. CXCL12 is particularly important for the recruitment of hemato/lymphopoietic cells to their target organs. In conjunction with the damage-associated alarmin molecule HMGB1, CXCL12 mediates immune effector and stem/progenitor cell migration towards damaged tissues for subsequent repair. Previously, we showed that cell migration to HMGB1 simultaneously requires both IKKβ and IKKα-dependent NF-κB activation. IKKβ-mediated activation maintains sufficient expression of HMGB1's receptor RAGE, while IKKα-dependent NF-κB activation ensures continuous production of CXCL12, which complexes with HMGB1 to engage CXCR4. Here using fibroblasts and primary mature macrophages, we show that IKKβ and IKKα are simultaneously essential for cell migration in response to CXCL12 alone. Non-canonical NF-κB pathway subunits RelB and p52 are also both essential for cell migration towards CXCL12, suggesting that IKKα is required to drive non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Flow cytometric analyses of CXCR4 expression show that IKKβ, but not IKKα, is required to maintain a critical threshold level of this CXCL12 receptor. Time-lapse video microscopy experiments in primary MEFs reveal that IKKα is required both for polarization of cells towards a CXCL12 gradient and to establish a basal level of velocity towards CXCL12. In addition, CXCL12 modestly up-regulates IKKα-dependent p52 nuclear translocation and IKKα-dependent expression of the CXCL12 gene. On the basis of our collective results we posit that IKKα is needed to maintain the basal expression of a critical protein co-factor required for cell migration to CXCL12.

Abstract: The ability of neutrophils to rapidly change shape underlies their physiological functions of phagocytosis and spreading. A major problem in establishing the mechanism is that conventional microinjection of substances and indicators interferes with this dynamic cell behaviour. Here we show that electroinjection, a “no-touch” point-and-shoot means of introducing material into the cell, is sufficiently gentle to allow neutrophils to be injected whilst undergoing chemokinesis and spreading without disturbing cell shape change behaviour. Using this approach, a fluorogenic calpain-1 selective peptide substrate was introduced into the cytosol of individual neutrophils undergoing shape changes. These data showed that (i) physiologically elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations were sufficient to trigger calpain-1 activation, blockade of Ca2+ influx preventing calpain activation and (ii) calpain-1 activity was elevated in spreading neutrophil. These findings provide the first direct demonstration of a physiological role for Ca2+ elevation in calpain-1 activation and rapid cell spreading. Electroinjection of cells undergoing dynamic shape changes thus opens new avenues of investigation for defining the molecular mechanism underlying dynamic cell shape changes.

Abstract: Cardiac fibroblasts significantly contribute to diabetes-induced structural and functional changes in the myocardium. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of high glucose (alone or supplemented with angiotensin II) in the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and its involvement in collagen I production by cardiac fibroblasts. We observed that the diabetic environment 1) enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3; 2) induced nuclear localization of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 through a reactive oxygen species-mediated mechanism, with angiotensin II stimulation further enhancing STAT3 nuclear accumulation; and 3) stimulated collagen I production. The effects were inhibited by depletion of reactive oxygen species or silencing of STAT3 in high glucose alone or supplemented with exogenous angiotensin II. Combined, our data demonstrate that increased collagen I deposition in the setting of high glucose occurred through a reactive oxygen species- and STAT3-dependent mechanism. Our results reveal a novel role for STAT3 as a key signaling molecule of collagen I production in cardiac fibroblasts exposed to a diabetic environment.

Abstract: Embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, which are considered to be malignant counterparts of embryonic stem cells, comprise the pluripotent stem cell component of teratocarcinomas, a form of testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs). Nevertheless, many established human EC cell lines are nullipotent with limited or no capacity to differentiate under normal circumstances. In this study, we tested whether an over-expression of Yamanaka's reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC and KLF4 might enable differentiation of the human nullipotent EC cells N2102Ep. Using OCT4 knockdown differentiated N2102Ep cells, we are able to derive reprogrammed N2102Ep cell lines. The induced pluripotency of N2102Ep allows the cells to differentiate toward neural lineage by retinoic acid; the expression of SSEA3 and SSEA4 is down-regulated, whereas that of neural surface markers is up-regulated. Consistent with the up-regulation of neural surface markers, the expression of the master neuroectodermal transcription factor PAX6 is also induced in reprogrammed N2102Ep. We next investigated whether PAX6 might induce spontaneous differentiation of nullipotent stem cells N2102Ep. However, while an ectopic expression of PAX6 promotes differentiation of NTERA2, it induces cell death in N2102Ep. We nevertheless find that upon induction of retinoic acid, the reprogrammed N2102Ep cells form mature neuronal morphology similar to differentiated pluripotent stem cells NTERA2 as determined by TUJ1 expression, which is absent in N2102Ep parental cells. Altogether, we conclude that the nullipotent state of human EC cells can be reprogrammed to acquire a more relaxed state of differentiation potential by Yamanaka's factors.

Abstract: Cultured mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from different sources represent a heterogeneous population of proliferating non-differentiated cells that contains multipotent stem cells capable of originating a variety of mesenchymal cell lineages. Despite tremendous progress in MSC biology spurred by their therapeutic potential, current knowledge on receptor and signaling systems of MSCs is mediocre. Here we isolated MSCs from the human adipose tissue and assayed their responsivity to GPCR agonists with Ca2+ imaging. As a whole, a MSC population exhibited functional heterogeneity. Although a variety of first messengers was capable of stimulating Ca2+ signaling in MSCs, only a relatively small group of cells was specifically responsive to the particular GPCR agonist, including noradrenaline. RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry revealed expression of α1B-, α2A-, and β2-adrenoreceptors in MSCs. Their sensitivity to subtype-specific adrenergic agonists/antagonists and certain inhibitors of Ca2+ signaling indicated that largely the α2A-isoform coupled to PLC endowed MSCs with sensitivity to noradrenaline. The all-or-nothing dose-dependence was characteristic of responsivity of robust adrenergic MSCs. Noradrenaline never elicited small or intermediate responses but initiated large and quite similar Ca2+ transients at all concentrations above the threshold. The inhibitory analysis and Ca2+ uncaging implicated Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in shaping Ca2+ signals elicited by noradrenaline. Evidence favored IP3 receptors as predominantly responsible for CICR. Based on the overall findings, we inferred that adrenergic transduction in MSCs includes two fundamentally different stages: noradrenaline initially triggers a local and relatively small Ca2+ signal, which next stimulates CICR, thereby being converted into a global Ca2+ signal.

Abstract: p62, also known as SQSTM1, is a multi-domain signalling scaffold protein involved in numerous critical cellular functions such as autophagy, apoptosis and inflammation. Crucial interactions relevant to these functions are mediated by the N-terminal Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain, which is divided into two interaction surfaces, one of predominantly acidic and one of basic character. Most known interaction partners, including atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), bind to the basic surface, and acidic–basic interactions at this interface also allow for p62 homopolymerisation. We identify here that the coupling of p62 to the cAMP signalling system is conferred by both the direct binding of cAMP degrading phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) to the acidic surface of the p62 PB1 domain and the phosphorylation of the basic surface of this domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Such phosphorylation is a previously unknown means of regulating PB1 domain interaction partnerships by disrupting the interaction of p62 with basic surface binding partners, such as aPKCs, as well as p62 homopolymerisation. Thus, we uncover a new regulatory mechanism that connects cAMP signalling with the p62 multi-domain signalling scaffold and autophagy cargo receptor protein.

Abstract: Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an essential physiological process for proper embryogenesis as well as for homeostasis during aging. In addition, apoptosis is one of the major mechanisms causing cell loss in pathophysiological conditions such as heart failure. Thus, inhibition of apoptosis is an important approach for preventive and therapeutic strategies. Here we show that the histone 3 lysine 4- and lysine 36-specific methyltransferase Smyd2 acts as an endogenous antagonistic player of p53-dependent cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Smyd2 protein levels were significantly decreased in cardiomyocytes upon cobalt chloride-induced apoptosis or myocardial infarction, while p53 expression was enhanced. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Smyd2 in cultured cardiomyocytes further enhanced cobalt chloride-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In contrast, Smyd2 overexpression resulted in marked methylation of p53 and prevented its accumulation as well as apoptotic cell death in an Hsp90-independent manner. Moreover, overexpression, of Smyd2, but not Smyd2Y240F lacking a methyl transferase activity, significantly rescued CoCl2-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cardioblasts. Finally, Smyd2 cardiomyocyte-specific deletion in vivo promoted apoptotic cell death upon myocardial infarction, which correlated with enhanced expression of p53 and pro-apoptotic Bax. Collectively, our data indicate Smyd2 as a cardioprotective protein by methylating p53.

Abstract: Inhibition of huntingtin aggregation, either in the nucleus and/or in the cytosol, has been identified as a major strategy to ameliorate the symptoms of Huntington's disease. Chaperones and other protein stabilisers would thus be key players in ensuring the correct folding of the amyloidogenic protein and its expression in the soluble form. By transient activation of the global heat stress response in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742, we show that heterologous expression of mutant huntingtin (103Q-htt) could be modulated so that the protein was partitioned off in the soluble fraction of the cytosol. This led to lower levels of reactive oxygen species and improved cell viability. Previous reports had speculated on the relationship between trehalose and the heat shock response in ensuring enhanced cell survival but no direct evidence of such an interaction was available. Using mutants of an isogenic strain which do not express the major trehalose synthetic or metabolising enzymes or the chaperone, heat shock protein 104 (Hsp104), we were able to identify the functions of Hsp104 and the osmoprotectant trehalose in solubilising mutant huntingtin. We propose that the beneficial effect of the protein refolding machinery in solubilising the aggregation-prone protein is exerted by maintaining a tight balance between the trehalose synthetic enzyme, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 1 and Hsp104. This ensures that the level of the osmoprotectant, trehalose, does not exceed the limit beyond which it is reported to inhibit protein refolding.

Abstract: The chemokine receptor CXCR4 interacts with a single endogenous chemokine, CXCL12, and regulates a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes including inflammation and metastasis development. CXCR4 also binds the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120, resulting in viral entry into host cells. Therefore, CXCR4 and its ligands represent valuable drug targets. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory properties of synthetic peptides derived from CXCR4 extracellular loops (ECL1-X4, ECL2-X4 and ECL3-X4) towards HIV-1 infection and CXCL12-mediated receptor activation. Among these peptides, ECL1-X4 displayed anti-HIV-1 activity against X4, R5/X4 and R5 viruses (IC50=24 to 76μM) in cell viability assay without impairing physiological CXCR4–CXCL12 signalling. In contrast, ECL2-X4 only inhibited X4 and R5/X4 strains, interfering with HIV-entry into cells. At the same time, ECL2-X4 strongly and specifically interacted with CXCL12, blocking its binding to CXCR4 and its second receptor, CXCR7 (IC50=20 and 100μM). Further analysis using mutated and truncated peptides showed that ECL2 of CXCR4 forms multiple contacts with the gp120 protein and the N-terminus of CXCL12. Chemokine neutralisation was mainly driven by four aspartates and the C-terminal residues of ECL2-X4. These results demonstrate that ECL2 represents an important structural determinant in CXCR4 activation. We identified the putative site for the binding of CXCL12 N-terminus and provided new structural elements to explain the recognition of gp120 and dimeric CXCR4 ligands.

Abstract: Hyperglycemia (HG) reduces AMPK activation leading to impaired autophagy and matrix accumulation. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) treatment improves HG-induced renovascular remodeling however, its mechanism remains unclear. Activation of LKB1 by the formation of heterotrimeric complex with STRAD and MO25 is known to activate AMPK. We hypothesized that in HG; H2S induces autophagy and modulates matrix synthesis through AMPK-dependent LKB1/STRAD/MO25 complex formation. To address this hypothesis, mouse glomerular endothelial cells were treated with normal and high glucose in the absence or presence of sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS), an H2S donor. HG decreased the expression of H2S regulating enzymes CBS and CSE, and autophagy markers Atg5, Atg7, Atg3 and LC3B/A ratio. HG increased galectin-3 and periostin, markers of matrix accumulation. Treatment with NaHS to HG cells increased LKB1/STRAD/MO25 formation and AMPK phosphorylation. Silencing the encoded genes confirmed complex formation under normoglycemia. H2S-mediated AMPK activation in HG was associated with upregulation of autophagy and diminished matrix accumulation. We conclude that H2S mitigates adverse remodeling in HG by induction of autophagy and regulation of matrix metabolism through LKB1/STRAD/MO25 dependent pathway.

Abstract: Microrchidia (MORC) family CW-type zinc finger 2 (MORC2) has been shown to be involved in several nuclear processes, including transcription modulation and DNA damage repair. However, its cytosolic function remains largely unknown. Here, we report an interaction between MORC2 and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-citrate lyase (ACLY), an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of acetyl-coA and plays a central role in lipogenesis, cholesterogenesis, and histone acetylation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MORC2 promotes ACLY activation in the cytosol of lipogenic breast cancer cells and plays an essential role in lipogenesis, adipogenesis and differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytic cells. Consistently, the expression of MORC2 is induced during the process of 3T3-L1 adipogenic differentiation and mouse mammary gland development at a stage of increased lipogenesis. This observation was accompanied by a high ACLY activity. Together, these results demonstrate a cytosolic function of MORC2 in lipogenesis, adipogenic differentiation, and lipid homeostasis by regulating the activity of ACLY.

Abstract: In spite of the numerous reports implicating MafB transcription factor in the molecular control of monocyte–macrophage differentiation, the precise genetic program underlying this activity has been, to date, poorly understood. To clarify this issue, we planned a number of experiments that were mainly conducted on human primary macrophages. In this regard, a preliminary gene function study, based on MafB inactivation and over-expression, indicated MMP9 and IL-7R genes as possible targets of the investigated transcription factor. Bioinformatics analysis of their promoter regions disclosed the presence of several putative MARE elements and a combined approach of EMSA and luciferase assay subsequently demonstrated that expression of both genes is indeed activated by MafB through a direct transcription mechanism. Additional investigation, performed with similar procedures to elucidate the biological relevance of our observation, revealed that MafB is a downstream target of the IL-10/STAT3 signaling pathway, normally inducing the macrophage de-activation process. Taken together our data support the existence of a signaling cascade by which stimulation of macrophages with the IL-10 cytokine determines a sequential activation of STAT3 and MafB transcription factors, in turn leading to an up-regulated expression of MMP9 and IL-7R genes.

Abstract: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes play a key role in the cellular machinery responsible for DNA repair. Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), a new inhibitor of NF-κB, induces oxidative stress and DNA damage. The effects of DHMEQ in combination with Olaparib (PARP inhibitor) were studied on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The DHMEQ–Olaparib combination synergistically inhibited cell viability, cell proliferation and colony formation of Hep3B, but had additive effects on Huh7 cells. The synergistic effects of the combination correlated with increased apoptosis, caspase 3/7 activity and PARP cleavage. There was an induction of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response with significant up-regulation of CHOP and TRB3 genes and splicing of XBP1 mRNA in Hep3B cells but not in Huh7 cells. Silencing of the TRB3 mRNA in Hep3B cells reversed the reduction in viability caused by DHMEQ–Olaparib treatment, while depletion of unspliced XBP1 mRNA in DHMEQ–Olaparib-treated Huh7 cells reduced viability. ROS production was increased after DHMEQ–Olaparib treatment of Hep3B, which caused DNA damage by an accumulation of γH2AX, increased AKT phosphorylation and reduced cell viability. The combination reduced Rad51 nuclear foci in Hep3B cells (not Huh7 cells), and silencing of Rad51 enhanced sensitivity of Huh7 cells to the DHMEQ–Olaparib combination. Knockdown of AKT in Hep3B cells restored the number of Rad51 nuclear foci after DHMEQ–Olaparib treatment. In summary, the DHMEQ–Olaparib combination induced ROS production, which killed HCC cells via DNA damage that could not be repaired by Rad51.
Summary
PARPs and NF-κB are frequently deregulated in HCC. The DHMEQ–Olaparib combination exerted synergistic anti-tumour effects on HCC cells through ROS production via DNA damage that could not be repaired by Rad51. This suggested that the DHMEQ–Olaparib combination could be used to treat tumours that were resistant to Olaparib treatment.

Abstract: Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulates several physiological processes such as the cell cycle, cell growth, apoptosis, and signal transduction. In this study, we examined the expression and role of PP2A Cα in adipocyte differentiation. PP2A Cα expression and PP2A activity decreased during adipocyte differentiation in C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 cells and the expression of adipocyte marker genes such as PPARγ and adiponectin increased. To further clarify the role of PP2A Cα in adipocyte differentiation, we constructed PP2A knockdown cells by infecting C3H10T1/2 cells with a lentivirus expressing a shRNA specific for the PP2A Cα (shPP2A cells). Silencing of PP2A Cα in C3H10T1/2 cells dramatically stimulated adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, which were accompanied by expression of adipocyte marker genes. Silencing of PP2A Cα suppressed Wnt10b expression and reduced the levels of the inactivated form of GSK-3β (phospho-GSK-3β), leading to the reduction of β-catenin levels in the nucleus and its transcriptional activity. Treatment with LiCl, a GSK-3β inhibitor, and inhibition of PPARγ expression suppressed the accelerated adipogenesis of shPP2A cells. Our data indicate that PP2A Cα plays an important role in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation by regulating the Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway and PPARγ expression.

Abstract: In response to stress or injury the heart undergoes an adverse remodeling process associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis. Transformation of cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts is a crucial event initiating the fibrotic process. Cardiac myofibroblasts invade the myocardium and secrete excess amounts of extracellular matrix proteins, which cause myocardial stiffening, cardiac dysfunctions and progression to heart failure. While several studies indicate that the small GTPase RhoA can promote profibrotic responses, the exchange factors that modulate its activity in cardiac fibroblasts are yet to be identified. In the present study, we show that AKAP-Lbc, an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) with an intrinsic Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, is critical for activating RhoA and transducing profibrotic signals downstream of type I angiotensin II receptors (AT1Rs) in cardiac fibroblasts. In particular, our results indicate that suppression of AKAP-Lbc expression by infecting adult rat ventricular fibroblasts with lentiviruses encoding AKAP-Lbc specific short hairpin (sh) RNAs strongly reduces the ability of angiotensin II to promote RhoA activation, differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, collagen deposition as well as myofibroblast migration. Interestingly, AT1Rs promote AKAP-Lbc activation via a pathway that requires the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G12. These findings identify AKAP-Lbc as a key Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor modulating profibrotic responses in cardiac fibroblasts.

Energy adaptive response during parthanatos is enhanced by PD98059 and involves mitochondrial function but not autophagy induction,

Abstract: Parthanatos is a programmed necrotic demise characteristic of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) consumption due to NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) depletion by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-dependent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on target proteins. However, how the bioenergetics is adaptively regulated during parthanatos, especially under the condition of macroautophagy deficiency, remains poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrated that the parthanatic inducer N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) triggered ATP depletion followed by recovery in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Notably, Atg5−/− MEFs showed great susceptibility to MNNG with disabled ATP-producing capacity. Moreover, the differential energy-adaptive responses in wild-type (WT) and Atg5−/− MEFs were unequivocally worsened by inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and mitochondrial activity. Importantly, Atg5−/− MEFs disclosed diminished SIRT1 and mitochondrial activity essential to the energy restoration during parthanatos. Strikingly, however, parthanatos cannot be exasperated by bafilomycin A1 and MNNG neither provokes microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation and p62 elimination, suggesting that parthanatos does not induce autophagic flux. Intriguingly, we reported unexpectedly that PD98059, even at low concentration insufficient to inhibit MEK, can promote mitochondrial activity and facilitate energy-restoring process during parthanatos, without modulating DNA damage responses as evidenced by PARP1 activity, p53 expression, and γH2AX (H2A histone family, member X (H2AX), phosphorylated on Serine 139) induction. Therefore, we propose that Atg5 deficiency confers an infirmity to overcome the energy crisis during parthanatos and further underscore the deficits in mitochondrial quality control, but not incapability of autophagy induction, that explain the vulnerability in Atg5-deficient cells. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive energy perspective for an improved treatment to alleviate parthanatos-related tissue necrosis and disease progression and also provide a future direction for drug development on the basis of PD98059 as an efficacious compound against parthanatos.

Abstract: Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) is a novel gene that is activated early in colorectal cancer but whose regulation and functions are unknown. CRNDE transcripts are recognized as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which potentially interact with chromatin-modifying complexes to regulate gene expression via epigenetic changes. Complex alternative splicing results in numerous transcripts from this gene, and we have identified novel transcripts containing a highly-conserved sequence within intron 4 (“gVC-In4”). In colorectal cancer cells, we demonstrate that treatment with insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF) repressed CRNDE nuclear transcripts, including those encompassing gVC-In4. These repressive effects were negated by use of inhibitors against either the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway or Raf/MAPK pathway, suggesting CRNDE is a downstream target of both signaling cascades. Expression array analyses revealed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of gVC-In4 transcripts affected the expression of many genes, which showed correlation with insulin/IGF signaling pathway components and responses, including glucose and lipid metabolism. Some of the genes are identical to those affected by insulin treatment in the same cell line. The results suggest that CRNDE expression promotes the metabolic changes by which cancer cells switch to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). This is the first report of a lncRNA regulated by insulin/IGFs, and our findings indicate a role for CRNDE nuclear transcripts in regulating cellular metabolism which may correlate with their upregulation in colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that at low concentrations, ouabain increases Na–K ATPase and NHE1 activity and activates the Src signaling cascade in proximal tubule cells. Our laboratory demonstrated that low concentrations of ouabain increase blood pressure in rats. We hypothesize that ouabain-induced increase in blood pressure and Na–K ATPase activity requires NHE1 activity and association. To test this hypothesis we treated rats with ouabain (1μgkg body wt−1day−1) for 9days in the presence or absence of the NHE1 inhibitor, zoniporide. Ouabain stimulated a significant increase in blood pressure which was prevented by zoniporide. Using NHE1-expressing Human Kidney cells 2 (HK2), 8 (HK8) and 11 (HK11) and Mouse Kidney cells from Wild type (WT) and NHE1 knock-out mice (SWE) cell lines, we show that ouabain stimulated Na–K ATPase activity and surface expression in a Src-dependent manner in NHE1-expressing cells but not in NHE1-deplete cells. Zoniporide prevented ouabain-induced stimulation of 86Rb uptake in the NHE1-expressing cells. FRET and TIRF microscopy showed that ouabain increased association between GFP-NHE1 and mCherry-Na–K ATPase transfected into NHE1-deficient SWE cells. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the caveolin binding motif (CBM) of Na–K ATPase α1 is required for translocation of both Na–K ATPase α1 and NHE1 to the basolateral membrane. Mutations in activity or scaffold domains of NHE1 resulted in loss of ouabain-mediated regulation of Na–K ATPase. These results support that NHE1 is required for the ouabain-induced increase in blood pressure, and that the caveolin binding motif of Na–K ATPase α1 as well as the activity and scaffolding domains of NHE1 are required for their functional association.

Abstract: The interaction of a ligand with a macromolecule has been modeled following different theories. The tenants of the induced fit model consider that upon ligand binding, the protein–ligand complex undergoes a conformational change. In contrast, the allosteric model assumes that only one among different coexisting conformers of a given protein is suitable to bind the ligand optimally. In the present paper, we propose a general framework to model the binding of ligands to a macromolecule. Such framework built on the binding polynomial allows opening new ways to teach in a unified manner ligand binding, enzymology and receptor binding in pharmacology. Moreover, we have developed simple software that allows building the binding polynomial from the schematic description of the biological system under study. Taking calmodulin as a canonical example, we show here that the proposed tool allows the easy retrieval of previously experimental and computational reports. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Calcium Signaling in Health and Disease. Guest Editors: Geert Bultynck, Jacques Haiech, Claus W. Heizmann, Joachim Krebs, and Marc Moreau.

Abstract: Abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in the brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition to neurotoxic effects, Aβ also damages brain endothelial cells (ECs) and may thus contribute to the degeneration of cerebral vasculature, which has been proposed as an early pathogenic event in the course of AD and is able to trigger and/or potentiate the neurodegenerative process and cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms underlying Aβ-induced endothelial dysfunction are not completely understood. Here we hypothesized that Aβ impairs protein quality control mechanisms both in the secretory pathway and in the cytosol in brain ECs, leading cells to death. In rat brain RBE4 cells, we demonstrated that Aβ1–40 induces the failure of the ER stress-adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), deregulates the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) decreasing overall proteasome activity with accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and impairs the autophagic protein degradation pathway due to failure in the autophagic flux, which culminates in cell demise. In conclusion, Aβ deregulates proteostasis in brain ECs and, as a consequence, these cells die by apoptosis.

Abstract: Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tubular cells is one of the mechanisms which contribute to renal fibrosis and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is one of the main triggers. Heparanase (HPSE) is an endo-β-D-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan-sulfate thus regulating the bioavailability of growth factors (FGF-2, TGF-β). HPSE controls FGF-2-induced EMT in tubular cells and is necessary for the development of diabetic nephropathy in mice. The aim of this study was to investigate whether HPSE can modulate the expression and the effects of TGF-β in tubular cells. First we proved that the lack of HPSE or its inhibition prevents the increased synthesis of TGF-β by tubular cells in response to pro-fibrotic stimuli such as FGF-2, advanced glycosylation end products (AGE) and albumin overload. Second, since TGF-β may derive from sources different from tubular cells, we investigated whether HPSE modulates tubular cell response to exogenous TGF-β. HPSE does not prevent EMT induced by TGF-β although it slows its onset; indeed in HPSE-silenced cells the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype does not develop as quickly as in wt cells. Additionally, TGF-β induces an autocrine loop to sustain its signal, whereas the lack of HPSE partially interferes with this autocrine loop. Overall these data confirm that HPSE is a key player in renal fibrosis since it interacts with the regulation and the effects of TGF-β. HPSE is needed for pathological TGF-β overexpression in response to pro-fibrotic factors. Furthermore, HPSE modulates TGF-β-induced EMT: the lack of HPSE delays tubular cell transdifferentiation, and impairs the TGF-β autocrine loop.

Abstract: The ErbB3 receptor is an important regulator of cell growth and carcinogenesis. Among breast cancer patients, up to 50–70% have ErbB3 overexpression and 20–30% show overexpressed or amplified ErbB2. ErbB3 has also been implicated in the development of resistance to several drugs used against cancers driven by ErbB1 or ErbB2. One of the main challenges in ErbB-targeting therapy is to inactivate signaling mediated by ErbB2–ErbB3 oncogenic receptor complexes. We analyzed the regulatory role of flotillins on ErbB3 levels and ErbB2–ErbB3 complexes in SKBR3, MCF7 and MDA-MB-134-VI human breast cancer cells. Recently, we described a mechanism for interfering with ErbB2 signaling in breast cancer and demonstrated a molecular complex of flotillin scaffolding proteins with ErbB2 and Hsp90. In the present study, flotillins were found to be in a molecular complex with ErbB3, even in cells without the presence of ErbB2 or other ErbB receptors. Depletion of either flotillin-1 or flotillin-2 resulted in downregulation of ErbB3 and a selective reduction of ErbB2–ErbB3 receptor complexes. Moreover, flotillin-2 depletion resulted in reduced activation of Akt and MAPK signaling cascades, and as a functional consequence of flotillin depletion, breast cancer cells showed an impaired cell migration. Altogether, we provide data demonstrating a novel and functional role of flotillins in the regulation of ErbB protein levels and stabilization of ErbB2–ErbB3 receptor complexes. Thus, flotillins are crucial regulators for oncogenic ErbB function and potential targets for cancer treatment.

Abstract: Centrosome amplification, which is a characteristic of cancer cells, has been understood as a driving force of genetic instability in the development of cancer. In previous work, we demonstrated that TEIF (transcriptional element-interacting factor) distributes in the centrosomes and regulates centrosome status under both physiologic and pathologic conditions. Here we identify TEIF as a downstream effector in EGF/PI3K/Akt signaling. The addition of EGF or transfection of active Akt stimulates centrosome TEIF distribution, resulting in an increase of centrosome splitting and amplification, while inhibitors of either PI3K or Akt attenuate these changes in TEIF and the associated centrosome status. A consensus motif for Akt phosphorylation (RHRVLT) proved to be involved in centrosomal TEIF localization, and the 469-threonine of this motif may be phosphorylated by Akt both in vitro and in vivo. Elimination of this phosphorylated site on TEIF caused reduced centrosome distribution and centrosome splitting or amplification. Moreover, TEIF closely co-localized with C-NAP1 at the proximal ends of centrioles, and centriolar loading of TEIF stimulated by EGF/Akt could displace C-NAP1, resulting in centrosome splitting. These findings reveal linkage of the EGF/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to regulation of centrosome status which may act as an oncogenic pathway and induce genetic instability in carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Hsf4b, a key regulator of postnatal lens development, is subjected to posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation. However, the phosphorylation sites in Hsf4b and their biological effects on the transcription activity of Hsf4b are poorly understood. Here we examined 17 potential phosphorylation residues in Hsf4b with alanine-scanning assays and found that a T472A mutation diminished Hsf4b-mediated expression of Hsp25 and αB-crystallin. In contrast, the phosphomimetic mutation of T472D enhanced their expression. Further investigation demonstrated that Hsf4b could interact with nuclear-transporter importin β-1 and Hsc70 via amino acids 246–320 and 320–493, respectively. T472A mutation reduced Hsf4b's interaction with importin β-1, while enhancing its interaction with Hsc70, resulting in Hsf4b cytosolic re-localization, protein instability and transcription activity attenuation. At the upstream, MEK6 was found to interact with Hsf4b and enhance Hsf4b's nuclear translocation and transcription activity, probably by phosphorylation at sites such as T472. Taken together, our results suggest that phosphorylation of Hsf4b at T472 by protein kinases such as MEK6 regulates Hsf4b interaction with the importin β-1-Hsc70 complex, resulting in blockade of its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of Hsf4b.

Abstract: Many bacteria assemble extracellular amyloid fibers on their cell surface. Secretion of proteins across membranes and the assembly of complex macromolecular structures must be highly coordinated to avoid the accumulation of potentially toxic intracellular protein aggregates. Extracellular amyloid fiber assembly poses an even greater threat to cellular health due to the highly aggregative nature of amyloids and the inherent toxicity of amyloid assembly intermediates. Therefore, temporal and spatial control of amyloid protein secretion is paramount. The biogenesis and assembly of the extracellular bacterial amyloid curli is an ideal system for studying how bacteria cope with the many challenges of controlled and ordered amyloid assembly. Here, we review the recent progress in the curli field that has made curli biogenesis one of the best-understood functional amyloid assembly pathways.

Abstract: Nucleotides activating P2Y13 receptors display neuroprotective actions against different apoptotic stimuli in cerebellar granule neurons. In the present study, P2Y13 neuroprotection was analyzed in conditions of genotoxic stress. Exposure to cisplatin and UV radiation induced caspase-3-dependent apoptotic cell death, and p38 MAPK signaling de-regulation. Pre-treatment with P2Y13 nucleotide agonist, 2methyl-thio-ADP (2MeSADP), restored granule neuron survival and prevented p38 long-lasting activation induced by cytotoxic treatments. Microarray gene expression analysis in 2MeSADP-stimulated cells revealed over-representation of genes related to protein phosphatase activity. Among them, dual-specificity phosphatase-2, DUSP2, was validated as a transcriptional target for P2Y13 receptors by QPCR. This effect could explain 2MeSADP ability to dephosphorylate a DUSP2 substrate, p38, reestablishing the inactive form. In addition, cisplatin-induced p38 sustained activation correlated perfectly with progressive reduction in DUSP2 expression. In conclusion, P2Y13 receptors regulate DUSP2 expression and contribute to p38 signaling homeostasis and survival in granule neurons.

Abstract: PADs (peptidylarginine deiminases) are calcium-dependent enzymes that change protein-bound arginine to citrulline (citrullination/deimination) affecting protein conformation and function. PAD up-regulation following chick spinal cord injury has been linked to extensive tissue damage and loss of regenerative capability. Having found that human neural stem cells (hNSCs) expressed PAD2 and PAD3, we studied PAD function in these cells and investigated PAD3 as a potential target for neuroprotection by mimicking calcium-induced secondary injury responses. We show that PAD3, rather than PAD2 is a modulator of cell growth/death and that PAD activity is not associated with caspase-3-dependent cell death, but is required for AIF (apoptosis inducing factor)-mediated apoptosis. PAD inhibition prevents association of PAD3 with AIF and AIF cleavage required for its translocation to the nucleus. Finally, PAD inhibition also hinders calcium-induced cytoskeleton disassembly and association of PAD3 with vimentin, that we show to be associated also with AIF; together this suggests that PAD-dependent cytoskeleton disassembly may play a role in AIF translocation to the nucleus. This is the first study highlighting a role of PAD activity in balancing hNSC survival/death, identifying PAD3 as an important upstream regulator of calcium-induced apoptosis, which could be targeted to reduce neural loss, and shedding light on the mechanisms involved.

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) is a potential biomarker for chondrosarcoma that is overexpressed at the invading edges of articular cartilage, and its expression correlates with poor survival rates. However, the molecular mechanisms of MMP-1 regulation and its potential contribution to chondrosarcoma cell invasion have yet to be elucidated, especially in shear-activated cells. Using molecular biology tools and an in vitro fluid shear model, we report that shear stress upregulates cyclic AMP (cAMP) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release, which in turn promotes the invasion of chondrosarcoma cells via the induction of MMP-1 in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)- and ERK1/2-dependent manner. Activated PI3-K and ERK1/2 signaling pathways phosphorylate c-Jun, which in turn transactivates MMP-1 in human chondrosarcoma cells. Collectively, fluid shear stress upregulates matrix MMP-1 expression, which is responsible for the enhanced invasion of human chondrosarcoma cells.

Abstract: The effects of hypoxia on gene expression have been vigorously studied, but possible effects of small changes in oxygen tension have never been addressed. SUR2A is an atypical ABC protein serving as a regulatory subunit of sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. Up-regulation of SUR2A is associated with cardioprotection and improved physical endurance. Here, we have found that a 24h-long exposure to slightly decreased ambient fractional concentration of oxygen (20% oxygen), which is an equivalent to oxygen tension at 350m above sea level, significantly increased levels of SUR2A in the heart despite that this drop of oxygen did not affect levels of O2, CO2 and hematocrit in the blood or myocardial levels of ATP, lactate and NAD/NADH/NAD+. Hearts from mice exposed to 20% oxygen were significantly more resistant to ischaemia-reperfusion when compared to control ones. Decrease in fractional oxygen concentration of just 0.9% was associated with phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but not Akt, which was essential for up-regulation of SUR2A. These findings indicate that a small drop in oxygen tension up-regulates SUR2A in the heart by activating ERK signaling pathway. This is the first report to suggest that a minimal change in oxygen tension could have a profound signaling effect.

Abstract: The PAK2/βPIX/GIT1 (p21-activated kinase 2/PAK-interacting exchange factor-β/G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interactor 1) complex has been shown to distribute to both membrane ruffles and focal adhesions of cells, where it plays an important role in regulating focal adhesion turnover. However, the detailed mechanism underlying this regulation is largely unknown. We previously reported that MYO18Aα interacts via its carboxyl terminus with the PAK2/βPIX/GIT1 complex through direct binding to βPIX, and that knockdown of MYO18Aα in epithelial cells causes accumulation of the complex in focal adhesions and decreased cell migration ability (Hsu et al., 2010). The current study characterized the detailed MYO18Aα–βPIX interaction mechanism and the biological significance of this interaction. We found that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal globular domain of MYO18Aα profoundly altered the cellular localization of βPIX and inhibited cell migration. βPIX interacts through its most carboxyl-terminus, PAWDETNL (639–646), with MYO18Aα and partially colocalized with MYO18Aα in membrane ruffles of cells, whereas βPIX1–638, a mutant with deletion of PAWDETNL, accumulated in focal adhesions. Both focal adhesion numbers and area in βPIX1–638-expressing cells were greater than those in cells expressing wild-type βPIXFL. Further experiments using deletion mutants of MYO18A and βPIX showed that disruption of MYO18A–βPIX interaction not only impaired cell motility but also decreased Rac1 activity. Collectively, our data unravel the interaction regions between MYO18A and βPIX and provide evidence for the critical role of this interaction in regulating cellular localization of βPIX, Rac1 activity, and adhesion and migration in epithelial cells.

Abstract: Accumulation of transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) fragments in motor neurons is a post mortem hallmark of different neurodegenerative diseases. TDP-43 fragments are the products of the apoptotic caspases-3 and -7. Either excessive or insufficient cellular Ca2+ availability is associated with activation of apoptotic caspases. However, as far as we know, it is not described whether activation of caspases, due to restricted intracellular Ca2+, affects TDP-43 cleavage. Here we show that in various cell lineages with restricted Ca2+ availability, TDP-43 is initially cleaved by caspases-3 and -7 and then, also by caspases-6 and -8 once activated by caspase-3. Furthermore, we disclose the existence of a TDP-43 caspase-mediated fragment of 15kDa, in addition to the well-known fragments of 35 and 25kDa. Interestingly, with respect to the other two fragments this novel fragment is the major product of caspase activity on murine TDP-43 whereas in human cell lines the opposite occurs. This outcome should be considered when murine models are used to investigate TDP-43 proteinopathies.

Abstract: The trabecular meshwork (TM) is part of a complex tissue that controls the exit of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye, and therefore helps maintaining intraocular pressure (IOP). Because of variations in IOP with changing pressure gradients and fluid movement, the TM and its contained cells undergo morphological deformations, resulting in distention and stretching. It is therefore essential for TM cells to continuously detect and respond to these mechanical forces and adapt their physiology to maintain proper cellular function and protect against mechanical injury. Here we demonstrate the activation of autophagy, a pro-survival pathway responsible for the degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles, in TM cells when subjected to biaxial static stretch (20% elongation), as well as in high-pressure perfused eyes (30mmHg). Morphological and biochemical markers for autophagy found in the stretched cells include elevated LC3-II levels, increased autophagic flux, and the presence of autophagic figures in electron micrographs. Furthermore, our results indicate that the stretch-induced autophagy in TM cells occurs in an MTOR- and BAG3-independent manner. We hypothesize that activation of autophagy is part of the physiological response that allows TM cells to cope and adapt to mechanical forces.

Abstract: MEK Kinase 2 (MEKK2) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) to regulate activation of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs). We recently have demonstrated that ablation of MEKK2 expression in invasive breast tumor cells dramatically inhibits xenograft metastasis, but the mechanism by which MEKK2 influences metastasis-related tumor cell function is unknown. In this study, we investigate MEKK2 function and demonstrate that silencing MEKK2 expression in breast tumor cell significantly enhances cell spread area and focal adhesion stability while reducing cell migration. We show that cell attachment to the matrix proteins fibronectin or Matrigel induces MEKK2 activation and localization to focal adhesions. Further, we reveal that MEKK2 ablation enhances focal adhesion size and frequency, thereby linking MEKK2 function to focal adhesion stability. Finally, we show that MEKK2 knockdown inhibits fibronectin-induced Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 5 (ERK5) signaling and Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) autophosphorylation. Taken together, our results strongly support a role for MEKK2 as a regulator of signaling that modulates breast tumor cell spread area and migration through control of focal adhesion stability.

Abstract: Interferon-gamma (Ifnγ), a known immunomodulatory cytokine, regulates cell proliferation and survival. In this study, the mechanisms leading to the selective susceptibility of some tumor cells to Ifnγ were deciphered. Seven different mouse tumor cell lines tested demonstrated upregulation of MHC class I to variable extents with Ifnγ; however, only the cell lines, H6 hepatoma and L929 fibrosarcoma, that produce higher amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are sensitive to Ifnγ-induced cell death. NO inhibitors greatly reduce Ifnγ-induced ROS; however, ROS inhibitors did not affect the levels of Ifnγ-induced NO, demonstrating that NO regulates ROS. Consequently, NO inhibitors are more effective, compared to ROS inhibitors, in reducing Ifnγ-induced cell death. Further analysis revealed that Ifnγ induces peroxynitrite and 3-nitrotyrosine amounts and a peroxynitrite scavenger, FeTPPS, reduces cell death. Ifnγ treatment induces the phosphorylation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (Jnk) in H6 and L929 but not CT26, a colon carcinoma cell line, which is resistant to Ifnγ-mediated death. Jnk activation downstream to NO leads to induction of ROS, peroxynitrite and cell death in response to Ifnγ. Importantly, three cell lines tested, i.e. CT26, EL4 and Neuro2a, that are resistant to cell death with Ifnγ alone become sensitive to the combination of Ifnγ and NO donor or ROS inducer in a peroxynitrite-dependent manner. Overall, this study delineates the key roles of NO as the initiator and Jnk, ROS, and peroxynitrite as the effectors during Ifnγ-mediated cell death. The implications of these findings in the Ifnγ-mediated treatment of malignancies are discussed.

Regulation of methylglyoxal-elicited leukocyte recruitment by endothelial SGK1/GSK3 signaling,

Abstract: Excessive levels of the glycolysis metabolite methylglyoxal (MG) elicit enhanced expression of adhesion molecules which foster leukocyte–endothelial cell interactions. The signaling mechanisms involved remain elusive. To address this, we investigated the signal transduction of leukocyte- and endothelial-expressed phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) effector kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) in the regulation of MG-elicited leukocyte recruitment. Using intravital microscopy of mouse cremasteric microvasculature, we demonstrate that GSK3 inhibitors lithium and SB216763 mitigate MG-elicited leukocyte recruitment and microvascular hyperpermeability. In SVEC4-10EE2 endothelial cells, but not in neutrophils, MG transiently activates GSK3 by reducing inhibitory phospho-GSK3α/β (Ser21/9) which parallels decrease of phospho-Akt at early time points (<30min). At later time points (≥1h), MG induces GSK3 deactivation which is dissipated by siRNA silencing of SGK. MG treatment potentiates endothelial SGK1 mRNA, total SGK1, phospho-SGK1 and phospho-NDRG1. The SGK1 inhibitor GSK650394 attenuates MG-elicited leukocyte recruitment. Pharmacological inhibition or silencing endothelial GSK3 or SGK attenuates MG-triggered nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity. Furthermore, silencing SGK blunts MG-triggered redox-sensitive phosphorylation of endothelial transcription factor CREB. Inhibition of SGK1 or GSK3 mitigates the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules P- and E-selectins and ICAM-1. Moreover, SGK1-dependent CREB activation participates in MG-elicited ICAM-1 upregulation. We conclude that temporal activation of endothelial SGK1 and GSK3 is decisive in MG-elicited upregulation of transcription factors, adhesion molecule expression, and leukocyte-vascular endothelium interactions. This novel signaling pathway may link excessive MG levels in vivo to inflammation, thus, unraveling potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) increases expression of CD38 (a membrane-associated bifunctional enzyme regulating cyclic ADP ribose), and enhances agonist-induced intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) responses in human airway smooth muscle (ASM). We previously demonstrated that caveolae and their constituent protein caveolin-1 are important for ASM [Ca2+]i regulation, which is further enhanced by TNFα. Whether caveolae and CD38 are functionally linked in mediating TNFα effects is unknown. In this regard, whether the related cavin proteins (cavin-1 and -3) that maintain structure and function of caveolae play a role is also not known. In the present study, we hypothesized that TNFα effects on CD38 expression and function in human ASM involve caveolae. Caveolar fractions from isolated human ASM cells expressed CD38 and its expression was upregulated by exposure to 20ng/ml TNFα (48h). ASM cells expressed cavin-1 and cavin-3, which were also upregulated by TNFα. Knockdown of caveolin-1, cavin-1 or cavin-3 (using siRNA) all significantly reduced CD38 expression and ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity in the presence or absence of TNFα. Furthermore, caveolin-1, cavin-1 and cavin-3 siRNAs reduced [Ca2+]i responses to histamine under control conditions, and blunted the enhanced [Ca2+]i responses in TNFα-exposed cells. These data demonstrate that CD38 is expressed within caveolae and its function is linked to the caveolar regulatory proteins caveolin-1, cavin-1 and -3. The link between caveolae and CD38 is further enhanced during airway inflammation demonstrating the important role of caveolae in regulation of [Ca2+]i and contractility in the airway.

Abstract: c-MYC is an oncogenic transcription factor that is degraded by the proteasome pathway. However, the mechanism that regulates delivery of c-MYC to the proteasome for degradation is not well characterized. Here, the results show that the motor protein complex Kinesin-1 transports c-MYC to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of Kinesin-1 function enhanced ubiquitination of c-MYC and induced aggregation of c-MYC in the cytoplasm. Transport studies showed that the c-MYC aggregates moved from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and KIF5B is responsible for the transport in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasomal degradation process also resulted in an accumulation of c-MYC aggregates in the cytoplasm. Moreover, Kinesin-1 was shown to interact with c-MYC and the proteasome subunit S6a. Inhibition of Kinesin-1 function also reduced c-MYC-dependent transformation activities. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that Kinesin-1 transports c-MYC for proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm and the proper degradation of c-MYC mediated by Kinesin-1 transport is important for transformation activities of c-MYC. In addition, the results indicate that Kinesin-1 transport mechanism is important for degradation of a number of other proteins as well.

Abstract: As a signaling hub, p62/sequestosome plays important roles in cell signaling and degradation of misfolded proteins. p62 has been implicated as an adaptor protein to mediate autophagic clearance of insoluble protein aggregates in age-related diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is characterized by dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Our previous studies have shown that cigarette smoke (CS) induces oxidative stress and inhibits the proteasome pathway in cultured human RPE cells, suggesting that p62-mediated autophagy may become the major route to remove impaired proteins under such circumstances. In the present studies, we found that all p62 mRNA variants are abundantly expressed and upregulated by CS induced stress in cultured human RPE cells, yet isoform1 is the major translated form. We also show that p62 silencing exacerbated the CS induced accumulation of damaged proteins, both by suppressing autophagy and by inhibiting the Nrf2 antioxidant response, which in turn, increased protein oxidation. These effects of CS and p62 reduction were further confirmed in mice exposed to CS. We found that over-expression of p62 isoform1, but not its S403A mutant, which lacks affinity for ubiquitinated proteins, reduced misfolded proteins, yet simultaneously promoted an Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response. Thus, p62 provides dual, reciprocal enhancing protection to RPE cells from environmental stress induced protein misfolding and aggregation, by facilitating autophagy and the Nrf2 mediated antioxidant response, which might be a potential therapeutic target against AMD.

Abstract: Crystalline bodies (CBs) can develop in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of antibody-producing cells. Although this phenotype is often reported in association with plasma cell dyscrasias and other hematological disorders, the details of CB biogenesis and CB's roles in pathophysiology remain poorly understood. Using an imaging-based screening method, we identified a secretion-competent human IgG2/λ clone that develops spindle-shaped intracellular crystals in transiently-transfected HEK293 cells upon Brefeldin A treatment. When stably overexpressed from CHO cells, the IgG2/λ clone spontaneously produced spindle-shaped CBs in the ER. Some CBs were released to the extracellular space while remaining enclosed by the membranes of secretory pathway origin. Structural modeling on the variable-region did not uncover prominent surface characteristics such as charge clusters. In contrast, alterations to the constant domain-encoded properties revealed their modulatory roles in CB-inducing propensities and CB morphology. For example, deletion of the entire Fc domain changed the morphology of CBs into thin filaments. Elimination of an N-linked glycan by a N297A mutation promoted Russell body biogenesis accompanied by marked reduction in IgG secretion. Isotype class switching from the original IgG2 to IgG1 and IgG4 changed the crystal morphology from spindle-shaped to long needle and acicular shaped, respectively. The IgG3 version, in contrast, suppressed the CB formation. Either the HC or LC alone or the Fc-domain alone did not trigger CB biogenesis. An IgG's in vivo crystal morphology and crystallization propensity can thus be modulated by the properties genetically and biochemically encoded in the HC constant region.

Abstract: Cdc6 is cleaved at residues 442 and 290 by caspase-3 during apoptosis producing p49-tCdc6 and p32-tCdc6, respectively. While p32-tCdc6 is unable to translocate into the cytoplasm, p49-tCdc6 retains cytoplasmic translocation activity, but it has a lower efficiency than wild-type Cdc6. We hypothesized that a novel nuclear export signal (NES) sequence exists between amino acids 290 and 442. Cdc6 contains a novel NES in the region of amino acids 300–315 (NES2) that shares sequence similarity with NES1 at residues 462–476. In mutant versions of Cdc6, we replaced leucine with alanine in NES1 and NES2 and co-expressed the mutant constructs with cyclin A. We observed that the cytoplasmic translocation of these mutants was reduced in comparison to wild-type Cdc6. Moreover, the cytoplasmic translocation of a mutant in which all four leucine residues were mutated to alanine was significantly inhibited in comparison to the translocation of wild-type Cdc6. The Crm1 binding activities of Cdc6 NES mutants were consistent with the efficiency of its cytoplasmic translocation. Further studies have revealed that L468 and L470 of NES1 are required for cytoplasmic translocation of Cdc6 phosphorylated at S74, while L311 and L313 of NES2 accelerate the cytoplasmic translocation of Cdc6 phosphorylated at S54. These results suggest that the two NESs of Cdc6 work cooperatively and distinctly for the cytoplasmic translocation of Cdc6 phosphorylated at S74 and S54 by cyclin A/Cdk2.

Abstract: The present study was undertaken to clarify the function(s) of Endothelin-1 and its receptors ETAR and ETBR in osteolytic-bone metastasis from breast cancer, and their regulation by hepatocyte and transforming growth factors (HGF, TGF-β) and hypoxia. The aim was to evaluate the adaptability of bone metastasis to microenvironmental stimuli through Endothelin-1-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or the reverse process MET, and through osteomimicry possible key features for bone colonization. We compared low (MCF-7) and high (MDA-MB231) invasive-breast carcinoma cells, and 1833-bone metastatic clone, with human pair-matched primary breast-carcinomas and bone metastases. Parental MDA-MB231 and the derived 1833-clone responded oppositely to the stimuli. In 1833 cells, TGF-β and hypoxia increased Endothelin-1 release, altogether reducing invasiveness important for engraftment, while Endothelin-1 enhanced MDA-MB231 cell invasiveness. The Endothelin-1-autocrine loop contributed to the cooperation of intracellular-signaling pathways and extracellular stimuli triggering MET in 1833 cells, and EMT in MDA-MB231 cells. Only in 1833 cells, HGF negatively influenced transactivation and release of Endothelin-1, suggesting a temporal sequence of these stimuli with an initial role of HGF-triggered Wnt/β-catenin pathway in metastatization. Then, Endothelin-1/ETAR conferred MET and osteomimetic phenotypes, with Runt-related transcription factor 2 activation and metalloproteinase 9 expression, contributing to colonization and osteolysis. Findings with human pair-matched primary ductal carcinomas and bone metastases gave a translational significance to the molecular study. Endothelin-1, ETAR and ETBR correlated with the acquisition of malignant potential, because of high expression already in the in situ carcinoma. These molecular markers might be used as predictive index of aggressive behavior and invasive/metastatic phenotype.

Abstract: The dimerization and auto-transphosphorylation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) upon engagement by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) activates signals promoting the mitogenic response of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) due to liver injury, thus contributing to the development of hepatic fibrosis. We demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphatases Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 and 2 (SHP-1 and SHP-2) act as crucial regulators of a complex signaling network orchestrated by PDGFR activation in a spatio-temporal manner with diverse and opposing functions in HSCs. In fact, silencing of either phosphatase shows that SHP-2 is committed to PDGFR-mediated cell proliferation, whereas SHP-1 dephosphorylates PDGFR hence abrogating the downstream signaling pathways that result in HSC activation. In this regard, SHP-1 as an off-switch of PDGFR signaling appears to emerge as a valuable molecular target to trigger as to prevent HSC proliferation and the fibrogenic effects of HSC activation. We show that boswellic acid, a multitarget compound with potent anti-inflammatory action, exerts an anti-proliferative effect on HSCs, as in other cell models, by upregulating SHP-1 with subsequent dephosphorylation of PDGFR-β and downregulation of PDGF-dependent signaling after PDGF stimulation. Moreover, the synergism resulting from the combined use of boswellic acid and imatinib, which directly inhibits PDGFR-β activity, on activated HSCs offers new perspectives for the development of therapeutic strategies that could implement molecules affecting diverse players of this molecular circuit, thus paving the way to multi-drug low-dose regimens for liver fibrosis.

Abstract: Protease Nexin-1 (PN-1) or Serpine2 is a physiological regulator of extracellular proteases as thrombin and urokinase (uPA) in the brain. Besides, PN-1 is also implicated in some human cancers and further identified as a substrate for Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, a key enzyme in tumor invasiveness. Our aim was to study the role of PN-1 in the migration and invasive potential of glioma cells, using the rat C6 glioma cell line as stable clones transfected with pAVU6+27 vector expressing PN-1 short-hairpin RNA. We find that PN-1 knockdown enhanced the in vitro migration and invasiveness of C6 cells which also showed a strong gelatinolytic activity by in situ zymography. PN-1 silencing did not alter prothrombin whereas increased uPA, MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression levels and gelatinolytic activity in a conditioned medium from stable C6 cells. Selective inhibitors for MMP-9 (Inhibitor I), MMP-2 (Inhibitor III) or exogenous recombinant PN-1 added to the culture medium of C6 silenced cells restored either the migration and invasive ability or gelatinolytic activity thus validating the specificity of PN-1 silencing strategy. Phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-related kinases (Erk1/2 and p38 MAPK) involved in MMP-9 and MMP-2 signaling were increased in PN-1 silenced cells. This study shows that PN-1 affects glioma cell migration and invasiveness through the regulation of uPA and MMP-9/2 expression levels which contribute to the degradation of extracellular matrix during tumor invasion.

Abstract: In the last decade, the generation and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly hydrogen peroxide, in cell signalling transduction pathways have been intensively studied, and it is now clear that an increase of ROS level affects cellular growth and proliferation pathways related to cancer development. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been long thought to permeate biological membranes by simple diffusion since recent evidence challenged this notion disclosing the role of aquaporin water channels (AQP) in mediating H2O2 transport across plasma membranes. We previously demonstrated that NAD(P)H oxidase (Nox)-generated ROS sustain glucose uptake and cellular proliferation in leukaemia cells. The aim of this study was to assess whether specific AQP isoforms can channel Nox-produced H2O2 across the plasma membrane of leukaemia cells affecting downstream pathways linked to cell proliferation. In this work, we demonstrate that AQP inhibition caused a decrease in intracellular ROS accumulation in leukaemia cells both when H2O2 was produced by Nox enzymes and when it was exogenously added. Furthermore, AQP8 overexpression or silencing resulted to modulate VEGF capacity of triggering an H2O2 intracellular level increase or decrease, respectively. Finally, we report that AQP8 is capable of increasing H2O2-induced phosphorylation of both PI3K and p38 MAPK and that AQP8 expression affected positively cell proliferation. Taken together, the results here reported indicate that AQP8 is able to modulate H2O2 transport through the plasma membrane affecting redox signalling linked to leukaemia cell proliferation.

Abstract: Cytokinesis in yeast and mammalian cells is a highly coordinated process mediated by the constriction of an actomyosin ring. In yeasts, it is accompanied by the formation of a chitinous primary septum. Although much is known about the regulation of cytokinesis in budding yeast, overlapping functions of redundant genes complicates genetic analyses. Here, we investigated the effects of various deletion mutants on cytokinesis in the milk yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. To determine the spatiotemporal parameters of cytokinesis components, live-cell imaging of fluorophor-tagged KlMyo1 and a new Lifeact probe for KlAct1 was employed. In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where deletion of ScMYO1 is lethal, Klmyo1 deletion was temperature-sensitive. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the Klmyo1 deletion cells had a defect in the formation of the primary septum and in cell separation; this result was confirmed by FACS analyses. Deletion of KlCYK3 was lethal, whereas in S. cerevisiae a cyk3 deletion is synthetically lethal with hof1 deletion. Growth of Klhof1 mutants was osmoremedial at 25°C, as it is in S. cerevisiae. CYK3 and HOF1 genes cross-complemented in both species, suggesting that they are functional homologs. Inn1, a common interactor for these two regulators, was essential in both yeasts and the encoding genes did not cross-complement. The C2 domain of the Inn1 homologs conferred species specificity. Thus, our work establishes K. lactis as a model yeast to study cytokinesis with less genetic redundancy than S. cerevisiae. The viability of Klmyo1 deletions provides an advantage over budding yeast to study actomyosin-independent cytokinesis. Moreover, the lethality of Klcyk3 null mutants suggests that there are fewer functional redundancies with KlHof1 in K. lactis.

Abstract: Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) play significant roles in vertebrate organogenesis and morphogenesis. FGFR3 is a negative regulator of chondrogenesis and multiple mutations with constitutive activity of FGFR3 result in achondroplasia, one of the most common dwarfisms in humans, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we found that chondrocyte-specific deletion of BMP type I receptor a (Bmpr1a) rescued the bone overgrowth phenotype observed in Fgfr3 deficient mice by reducing chondrocyte differentiation. Consistently, using in vitro chondrogenic differentiation assay system, we demonstrated that FGFR3 inhibited BMPR1a-mediated chondrogenic differentiation. Furthermore, we showed that FGFR3 hyper-activation resulted in impaired BMP signaling in chondrocytes of mouse growth plates. We also found that FGFR3 inhibited BMP-2- or constitutively activated BMPR1-induced phosphorylation of Smads through a mechanism independent of its tyrosine kinase activity. We found that FGFR3 facilitates BMPR1a to degradation through Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination pathway. We demonstrated that down-regulation of BMP signaling by BMPR1 inhibitor dorsomorphin led to the retardation of chondrogenic differentiation, which mimics the effect of FGF-2 on chondrocytes and BMP-2 treatment partially rescued the retarded growth of cultured bone rudiments from thanatophoric dysplasia type II mice. Our findings reveal that FGFR3 promotes the degradation of BMPR1a, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasia.

Abstract: Immunoproteasomes are alternative forms of proteasomes specialized in the generation of MHC class I antigenic peptides and important for efficient cytokine production. We have identified a new biochemical property of 26S immunoproteasomes, namely the ability to hydrolyze basic proteins at greatly increased rates compared to constitutive proteasomes. This enhanced degradative capacity is specific for basic polypeptides, since substrates with a lower content in lysine and arginine residues are hydrolyzed at comparable rates by constitutive and immunoproteasomes. Crucially, selective inhibition of the immunoproteasome tryptic subunit β2i strongly reduces degradation of basic proteins. Therefore, our data demonstrate the rate limiting function of the proteasomal trypsin-like activity in controlling turnover rates of basic protein substrates and suggest new biological roles for immunoproteasomes in maintaining cellular homeostasis by rapidly removing a potentially harmful excess of free histones that can build up under different pathophysiological conditions.

Abstract: PVP-Hypericin (PVP: polyvinylpyrrolidone) is a potent anti-cancer photosensitizer for photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) and therapy (PDT). However, cellular targets and mechanisms involved in the cancer-selectivity of the photosensitizer are not yet fully understood. This paper gives new insights into the differential transport and localization of PVP-Hypericin in cancer and normal cells which are essential to unravel the mechanisms of action and cancer-selectivity. Temporal (TICS) and spatiotemporal (STICS) image correlation spectroscopy are used for the assessment of PVP-Hypericin diffusion and/or velocity in the case of concerted flow in human cervical epithelial HeLa and human lung carcinoma A549 cells, as well as in human primary dendritic cells (DC) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Spatiotemporal image cross-correlation spectroscopy (STICCS) based on organelle specific fluorescent labeling is employed to study the accumulation of the photosensitizer in nucleus, mitochondria, early-endosomes and lysosomes of the cells and to assess the dynamics of co-migrating molecules. Whereas STICS and TICS did not show a remarkable difference between the dynamics of PVP-Hypericin in HeLa, A549 and DC cells, a significantly different diffusion rate of the photosensitizer was measured in PBMC. STICCS detected a stationary accumulation of PVP-Hypericin within the nucleus, mitochondria, early endosomes and lysosomes of HeLa and A549 cells. However, significant flow due to the directed motion of the organelles was detected. In contrast, no accumulation in the nucleus and mitochondria of DC and PBMC could be monitored.

Abstract: Neuronal activity is highly dependent on energy metabolism. Nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF-2) tightly couples neuronal activity and energy metabolism by transcriptionally co-regulating all 13 subunits of an important energy-generating enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), as well as critical subunits of excitatory NMDA receptors. AMPA receptors are another major class of excitatory glutamatergic receptors that mediate most of the fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. They are heterotetrameric proteins composed of various combinations of GluA1–4 subunits, with GluA2 being the most common one. We have previously shown that GluA2 (Gria2) is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and specificity protein 4 (Sp4), which also regulate all subunits of COX. However, it was not known if NRF-2 also couples neuronal activity and energy metabolism by regulating subunits of the AMPA receptors. By means of multiple approaches, including electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, promoter mutations, real-time quantitative PCR, and western blot analysis, NRF-2 was found to functionally regulate the expression of Gria2, but not of Gria1, Gria3, or Gria4 genes in neurons. By regulating the GluA2 subunit of the AMPA receptor, NRF-2 couples energy metabolism and neuronal activity at the transcriptional level through a concurrent and parallel mechanism with NRF-1 and Sp4.

Abstract: Reduced glutathione (GSH) is an essential metabolite that performs multiple indispensable roles during the development of Dictyostelium. We show here that disruption of the gene (gcsA¯) encoding γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, an essential enzyme in GSH biosynthesis, inhibited aggregation, and that this developmental defect was rescued by exogenous GSH, but not by other thiols or antioxidants. In GSH-depleted gcsA¯ cells, the expression of a growth-stage-specific gene (cprD) was not inhibited, and we did not detect the expression of genes that encode proteins required for early development (cAMP receptor, carA/cAR1; adenylyl cyclase, acaA/ACA; and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, pkaC/PKA-C). The defects in gcsA¯ cells were not restored by cAMP stimulation or by cAR1 expression. Further, the expression of yakA, which initiates development and induces the expression of PKA-C, ACA, and cAR1, was regulated by the intracellular concentration of GSH. Constitutive expression of YakA in gcsA¯ cells (YakAOE/gcsA¯) rescued the defects in developmental initiation and the expression of early developmental genes in the absence of GSH. Taken together, these findings suggest that GSH plays an essential role in the transition from growth to development by modulating the expression of the genes encoding YakA as well as components that act downstream in the YakA signaling pathway.

Abstract: Halofuginone has been shown to prevent fibrosis via the transforming growth factor-β/Smad3 pathway in muscular dystrophies. We hypothesized that halofuginone would reduce apoptosis—the presumed cause of satellite-cell depletion during muscle degradation—in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Six-week-old mdx mouse diaphragm exhibited fourfold higher numbers of apoptotic nuclei compared with wild-type mice as determined by a TUNEL assay. Apoptotic nuclei were found in macrophages and in Pax7-expressing cells; some were located in centrally-nucleated regenerating myofibers. Halofuginone treatment of mdx mice reduced the apoptotic nuclei number in the diaphragm, together with reduction in Bax and induction in Bcl2 levels in myofibers isolated from these mice. A similar effect was observed when halofuginone was added to cultured myofibers. No apparent effect of halofuginone was observed in wild-type mice. Inhibition of apoptosis or staurosporine-induced apoptosis by halofuginone in mdx primary myoblasts and C2 myogenic cell line, respectively, was reflected by less pyknotic/apoptotic cells and reduced Bax expression. This reduction was reversed by a phosphinositide-3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase inhibitors, suggesting involvement of these pathways in mediating halofuginone's effects on apoptosis. Halofuginone increased apoptosis in α smooth muscle actin- and prolyl 4-hydroxylase β-expressing cells in mdx diaphragm and in myofibroblasts, the major source of extracellular matrix. The data suggest an additional mechanism by which halofuginone improves muscle pathology and function in muscular dystrophies.

Abstract: Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) is dispensable for mitotic cell cycle progression and Cdk2 knockout mice are viable due to the compensatory functions of other Cdks. In order to assess the role of Cdk2 under limiting conditions, we used Skp2 knockout mice that exhibit increased levels of Cdk inhibitor, p27Kip1, which is able to inhibit Cdk2 and Cdk1. Knockdown of Cdk2 abrogated proliferation of Skp2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, encouraging us to generate Cdk2−/−Skp2−/− double knockout mice. Cdk2−/−Skp2−/− double knockout mice are viable and display similar phenotypes as Cdk2−/− and Skp2−/− mice. Unexpectedly, fibroblasts generated from Cdk2−/−Skp2−/− double knockout mice proliferated at normal rates. The increased stability of p27 observed in Skp2−/− MEFs was not observed in Cdk2−/−Skp2−/− double knockout fibroblasts indicating that in the absence of Cdk2, p27 is regulated by Skp2-independent mechanisms. Ablation of other ubiquitin ligases for p27 such as KPC1, DDB1, and Pirh2 did not restore stability of p27 in Cdk2−/−Skp2−/− MEFs. Our findings point towards novel and alternate pathways for p27 regulation.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in various stages of tumor progression. miR-494, which we had previously identified as a miRNA induced by ionizing radiation (IR) in the glioma cell line U-251, was observed to enhance invasion of U-251 cells by activating MMP-2. The miR-494-induced invasive potential was accompanied by, and dependent on, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) upregulation and the activation of its downstream signaling constituents, Akt and ERK. The upregulation of EGFR by miR-494 involved the suppression of lysosomal protein turnover. Among the putative target proteins tested, p190B RhoGAP (p190B) was downregulated by miR-494, and its reduced expression was responsible for the increase in EGFR expression. A reporter assay using a luciferase construct containing p190B 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) confirmed that p190B is a direct target of miR-494. Downregulation of p190B by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection closely mimicked the outcomes of miR-494 transfection, and showed increased EGFR expression, MMP-2 secretion, and invasion. Ectopic expression of p190B suppressed the miR-494-induced EGFR upregulation and invasion promotion, thereby suggesting that p190B depletion is critical for the invasion-promoting action of miR-494. Collectively, our results suggest a novel function for miR-494 and its potential application as a target to control invasiveness in cancer therapy.
