Abstract: Important challenges in stem cell research and regenerative medicine are reliable assessment of pluripotency state and purity of differentiated cell populations. Pluripotency and differentiation are regulated and determined by activity of developmental signal transduction pathways (STPs). To date activity of these STPs could not be directly measured on a cell sample. Here we validate a novel assay platform for measurement of activity of developmental STPs (STP) for use in stem cells and stem cell derivatives. In addition to previously developed STP assays, we report development of an additional STP assay for the MAPK-AP1 pathway. Subsequently, activity of Notch, Hedgehog, TGFβ, Wnt, PI3K, MAPK-AP1, and NFκB signaling pathways was calculated from Affymetrix transcriptome data of human pluripotent embryonic (hES) and iPS cell lines under different culture conditions, organ-derived multipotent stem cells, and differentiated cell types, to generate quantitative STP activity profiles. Results show that the STP assay technology enables reliable and quantitative measurement of multiple STP activities simultaneously on any individual cell sample. Using the technology, we found that culture conditions dominantly influence the pluripotent stem cell STP activity profile, while the origin of the stem cell line was a minor variable. A pluripotency STP activity profile (Pluripotency qPAP) was defined (active PI3K, MAPK, Hedgehog, Notch, TGFβ, and NFκB pathway, inactive Wnt pathway). Differentiation of hES cells to intestinal progenitor cells resulted in an STP activity profile characterized by active PI3K, Wnt and Notch pathways, comparable to the STP activity profile measured on primary intestinal crypt stem cells. Quantitative STP activity measurement is expected to improve experimental reproducibility and standardization of pluripotent and multipotent stem cell culture/differentiation, and enable controlled manipulation of pluripotency/differentiation state using pathway targeting compounds.

Abstract: Osteoporosis is a prevalent degenerative disease that is characterized by decreased bone density and strength, resulting in gradually increasing bone fragility. Osteoporosis is caused by an imbalance between osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption. Recently, increasing evidence has suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in the occurrence and development of osteoporosis. Herein, we explored the role of lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). QPCR results indicated that KCNQ1OT1 and RICTOR were down-regulated, while miR-205-5p was up-regulated in the osteoporotic patients, as compared with non-osteoporotic controls. During the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, the expression of KCNQ1OT1 and RICTOR was upregulated, whereas miR-205-5p was downregulated. The interaction among KCNQ1OT1, miR-205-5p and RICTOR was validated by dual luciferase reporter system. KCNQ1OT1 promoted RICTOR expression via inhibiting miR-205-5p, therefore promoting osteogenesis as demonstrated by ALP assay, alizarin red staining and the increased expression of osteogenic markers (OPN, RUNX2 and OCN). Furthermore, KCNQ1OT1 overexpression or miR-205-5p inhibition could promote ALP activity and mineralization of BMSCs, while overexpressed miR-205-5p could reverse the effects of overexpressed KCNQ1OT1, and knockdown of RICTOR could reverse the effects of miR-205-5p inhibition. In conclusion, our study illustrated that KCNQ1OT1 might inhibit miR-205-5p in BMSCs, thus upregulating the expression of RICTOR and promoting osteogenic differentiation.

Abstract: Compared with normal cells, tumor cells mainly obtain energy through aerobic glycolysis. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) plays a key role in the regulation of tumor cell aerobic glycolysis, and targeting HK2 has become a new strategy for cancer treatment. However, little is known about the role of HK2 in colon cancer and the regulation of its targeted inhibitors. In this study, we found that the expression of HK2 in colorectal cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent tissues, and the expression level of HK2 in metastatic colorectal cancer was further increased. Meanwhile, the expression level of HK2 was closely related to clinical TNM stage and outcome of colorectal cancer patients. We provide here evidence that HK2 inhibitor 3-Bromopyruvate acid (3-BP) can significantly inhibit the survival and proliferation of colon cancer cells, and induce apoptosis through mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway. In addition, we found that 3-BP can also induce endoplasmic reticulum stress in colon cancer cells, the mechanism may be through the increase of intracellular calcium concentration. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress could further increase the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induced by 3-BP. Collectively, our results show that HK2 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer. 3-BP, an inhibitor of HK2, can induce apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress in colon cancer cells. Endoplasmic reticulum stress plays a protective role in cell death induced by 3-BP. This result suggested that targeting HK2 and endoplasmic reticulum stress may be a valuable strategy in targeted and combination therapy of colon cancer.

Abstract: In 2015, Brazil reported an outbreak identified as Zika virus (ZIKV) infection associated with congenital abnormalities. To date, a total of 86 countries and territories have described evidence of Zika infection and recently the appearance of the African ZIKV lineage in Brazil highlights the risk of a new epidemic. The spectrum of ZIKV infection-induced alterations at both cellular and molecular levels is not completely elucidated. Here, we present for the first time the gene expression responses associated with prenatal ZIKV infection from ocular cells. We applied a recently developed non-invasive method (impression cytology) which use eye cells as a model for ZIKV studies. The ocular profiling revealed significant differences between exposed and control groups, as well as a different pattern in ocular transcripts from Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) compared to ZIKV-exposed but asymptomatic infants. Our data showed pathways related to mismatch repair, cancer, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and genes probably causative or protective in the modulation of ZIKV infection. Ocular cells revealed the effects of ZIKV infection on primordial neuronal cell genes, evidenced by changes in genes associated with embryonic cells. The changes in gene expression support an association with the gestational period of the infection and provide evidence for the resulting clinical and ophthalmological pathologies. Additionally, the findings of cell death- and cancer-associated deregulated genes raise concerns about the early onset of other potential pathologies including the need for tumor surveillance. Our results thus provide direct evidence that infants exposed prenatally to the Zika virus, not only with CZS but also without clinical signs (asymptomatic) express cellular and molecular changes with potential clinical implications.

Abstract: The coiled-coil domain-containing protein 43 (CCDC43) is essential to promote gastric cancer (GC) proliferation and invasion, while four and a half LIM domains 1 (FHL1) involves GC cells apoptosis. We attempted to address inter-relationship between CCDC43 and FHL1 in modulating GC cells growth and apoptosis. Levels of protein expression were assessed by western blot, immunofluorescence. Using EdU, plate colony formation, Matrigel invasion and animal models, we evaluated the function in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses indicated that CCDC43 physically interacted with FHL1. The expression of CCDC43 was negatively correlated with FHL1. Moreover, up-regulation of CCDC43 resulted in FHL1 level decline, and the reverse is also true. CCDC43 expressed jointly with FHL1 group significantly decreases the ability of the growth, metastasis and invasion of GC cells compared with that of the CCDC43 group. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated repression of CCDC43 results in dissociation from FHL1 and causes suppression of GC cell proliferation and metastasis. CCDC43 repression mediates the stability of FHL1 protein. In addition, CCDC43 interacts with FHL1. Knockdown of CCDC43 plus FHL1 overexpression inhibits proliferation and migration and induces apoptosis of GC cells in vitro and vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Humans harbor numerous species of colonic bacteria that digest fiber polysaccharides in commonly consumed terrestrial plants. More recently in history, regional populations have consumed edible macroalgae seaweeds containing unique polysaccharides. It remains unclear how extensively gut bacteria have adapted to digest these nutrients. Here, we show that the ability of gut bacteria to digest seaweed polysaccharides is more pervasive than previously appreciated. Enrichment-cultured Bacteroides harbor previously discovered genes for seaweed degradation, which have mobilized into several members of this genus. Additionally, other examples of marine bacteria-derived genes, and their mobile DNA elements, are involved in gut microbial degradation of seaweed polysaccharides, including genes in gut-resident Firmicutes. Collectively, these results uncover multiple separate events that have mobilized the genes encoding seaweed-degrading-enzymes into gut bacteria. This work further underscores the metabolic plasticity of the human gut microbiome and global exchange of genes in the context of dietary selective pressures.

Abstract: Summary
Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain are a source of neural cells for brain injury repair. We investigated whether their capacity to generate new neurons and glia is determined by thyroid hormone (TH) during development because serum levels peak during postnatal reorganization of the main NSC niche, the subventricular zone (SVZ). Re-analysis of mouse transcriptome data revealed increased expression of TH transporters and deiodinases in postnatal SVZ NSCs, promoting local TH action, concomitant with a burst in neurogenesis. Inducing developmental hypothyroidism reduced NSC proliferation, disrupted expression of genes implicated in NSC determination and TH signaling, and altered the neuron/glia output in newborns. Three-month-old adult mice recovering from developmental hypothyroidism had fewer olfactory interneurons and underperformed on short-memory odor tests, dependent on SVZ neurogenesis. Our data provide readouts permitting comparison with adverse long-term events following thyroid disruptor exposure and ideas regarding the etiology of prevalent neurodegenerative diseases in industrialized countries.

Abstract: Although MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are generally effective against non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) with MET exon 14 skipping mutations (METΔex14), resistance to MET TKIs can occur, indicating the need to develop other therapeutic options. We found that Hs-746 T cells, which harbor METΔex14 plus amplification, were able to survive and grow in the absence of MET signaling, exhibiting primary resistance to MET TKIs. We also found a moderately positive correlation between MET and anthrax toxin receptor 2 (ANTXR2) mRNA expression in NSCLC cell lines using data from the Cancer Dependency Map database. As expected, Hs-746 T cells were positive for ANTXR2 expression. We used an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) analog in the form of an anti-ANTXR2 monoclonal antibody, H8R23, conjugated to DT3C recombinant protein which consists of diphtheria toxin (DT) lacking the receptor-binding domain but containing the C1, C2, and C3 domains of streptococcal protein G (3C). H8R23-DT3C conjugates, which function in vitro like an ADC, induced Hs-746 T cells to undergo apoptosis, resulting in decreased viability. These findings collectively suggest that an ADC targeting ANTXR2 could be effective for the treatment of METΔex14-positive NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Viruses are responsible for some of the most deadly human diseases, yet available vaccines and antivirals address only a fraction of the potential viral human pathogens. Here, we provide a methodology for managing human herpesvirus (HHV) infection by covalently inactivating the HHV maturational protease via a conserved, non-catalytic cysteine (C161). Using human cytomegalovirus protease (HCMV Pr) as a model, we screened a library of disulfides to identify molecules that tether to C161 and inhibit proteolysis, then elaborated hits into irreversible HCMV Pr inhibitors that exhibit broad-spectrum inhibition of other HHV Pr homologs. We further developed an optimized tool compound targeted toward HCMV Pr and used an integrative structural biology and biochemical approach to demonstrate inhibitor stabilization of HCMV Pr homodimerization, exploiting a conformational equilibrium to block proteolysis. Irreversible HCMV Pr inhibition disrupts HCMV infectivity in cells, providing proof of principle for targeting proteolysis via a non-catalytic cysteine to manage viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
Adult tissue homeostasis is maintained by residential stem cells. The proliferation and differentiation of adult stem cells must be tightly balanced to avoid excessive proliferation or premature differentiation. However, how stem cell proliferation is properly controlled remains elusive. Here, we find that auxilin (Aux) restricts intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation mainly through EGFR signaling. aux depletion leads to excessive ISC proliferation and midgut homeostasis disruption, which is unlikely caused by defective Notch signaling. Aux is expressed in multiple types of intestinal cells. Interestingly, aux depletion causes a dramatic increase in EGFR signaling, with a strong accumulation of EGFR at the plasma membrane and an increased expression of EGFR ligands in response to tissue stress. Furthermore, Aux co-localizes and associates with EGFR. Finally, blocking EGFR signaling completely suppresses the defects caused by aux depletion. Together, these data demonstrate that Aux mainly safeguards EGFR activation to keep a proper ISC proliferation rate to maintain midgut homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The cross-presenting capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) can be limited by non-specific degradation during endosome maturation. To bypass this limitation, we present in this study a new Accum-based formulation designed to promote endosome-to-cytosol escape. Treatment of primary DCs with Accum linked to the xenoantigen ovalbumin (OVA) triggers endosomal damages and enhances protein processing. Despite multiple challenges using ascending doses of tumor cells, DC prophylactic vaccination results in complete protection due to increased levels of effector CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as high production of pro-inflammatory mediators. When combined with anti-PD-1, therapeutic vaccination using both syngeneic and allogeneic Accum-OVA-pulsed DCs triggers potent anti-tumoral responses. The net outcome culminates in increased CD11c, CD8, and NK infiltration along with a high CD8/Treg ratio. These highly favorable therapeutic effects highlight the promising potential of Accum as a distinct and potent technology platform suitable for the design of next generation cell cancer vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in STK11/LKB1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are associated with poor patient responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), and introduction of a Stk11/Lkb1 (L) mutation into murine lung adenocarcinomas driven by mutant Kras and Trp53 loss (KP) resulted in an ICB refractory syngeneic KPL tumor. Mechanistically this occurred because KPL mutant NSCLCs lacked TCF1-expressing CD8 T cells, a phenotype recapitulated in human STK11/LKB1 mutant NSCLCs. Systemic inhibition of Axl results in increased type I interferon secretion from dendritic cells that expanded tumor-associated TCF1+PD-1+CD8 T cells, restoring therapeutic response to PD-1 ICB in KPL tumors. This was observed in syngeneic immunocompetent mouse models and in humanized mice bearing STK11/LKB1 mutant NSCLC human tumor xenografts. NSCLC-affected individuals with identified STK11/LKB1 mutations receiving bemcentinib and pembrolizumab demonstrated objective clinical response to combination therapy. We conclude that AXL is a critical targetable driver of immune suppression in STK11/LKB1 mutant NSCLC.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) play a pivotal role in modern therapeutic approaches of bone defect regeneration. A complication that is steadily increasing due to demographic population developments is an age-related disorder of the osteogenic differentiation potential (ODP) of MSCs. In the present in vitro study we have evaluated the impact of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants on ODP of “normal healthy” as well as osteogenetically compromised human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ASC). We show that although ASC exhibit a marked ODP, a significant number of ASC cultures showed a retarded osteogenesis. These so-called “non-responder”-ASC cultures (NR-ASC) expressed an antigenic phenotype identical to that of the well osteogenically differentiating “responder”-ASCs (R-ASC), but NR-ASC significantly correlated with the older age of their donors as well as with a significantly higher intracellular generation of ROS. Furthermore, we found that treatment of the cell cultures with low concentration of H2O2 seemed to promote osteogenic differentiation but higher H2O2 concentration strongly reduced osteogenesis in all ASC cultures. Additionally, we found that exogenously applied superoxide dismutase (SOD) or catalase completely restored the impaired ODP of NR-ASC, whereas ascorbate, glutathione, N-acetylcysteine or a water soluble vitamin E derivate did not show any relevant effects. Our results suggest that aging-related increases in oxidative stress, especially due to H2O2, can severely impair the ODP of ASC whereas SOD or catalase almost completely corrected this disorder. Our findings point to novel osteo-therapeutic aspects of catalase and SOD and open up new approaches to ASC-based regeneration of bone defects.

Abstract: Summary
Systematic insight into cellular dysfunction can improve understanding of disease etiology, risk assessment, and patient stratification. We present a multiparametric high-content imaging platform enabling quantification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake and lipid storage in cytoplasmic droplets of primary leukocyte subpopulations. We validate this platform with samples from 65 individuals with variable blood LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) levels, including familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and non-FH subjects. We integrate lipid storage data into another readout parameter, lipid mobilization, measuring the efficiency with which cells deplete lipid reservoirs. Lipid mobilization correlates positively with LDL uptake and negatively with hypercholesterolemia and age, improving differentiation of individuals with normal and elevated LDL-c. Moreover, combination of cell-based readouts with a polygenic risk score for LDL-c explains hypercholesterolemia better than the genetic risk score alone. This platform provides functional insights into cellular lipid trafficking and has broad possible applications in dissecting the cellular basis of metabolic disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of retinal organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) is now a well-established process that in part recapitulates retinal development. However, hPSC-derived photoreceptors that exhibit well-organized outer segment structures have yet to be observed. To facilitate improved inherited retinal disease modeling, we determined conditions that would support outer segment development in maturing hPSC-derived photoreceptors. We established that the use of antioxidants and BSA-bound fatty acids promotes the formation of membranous outer segment-like structures. Using new protocols for hPSC-derived retinal organoid culture, we demonstrated improved outer segment formation for both rod and cone photoreceptors, including organized stacked discs. Using these enhanced conditions to generate iPSC-derived retinal organoids from patients with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, we established robust cellular phenotypes that could be ameliorated following adeno-associated viral vector-mediated gene augmentation. These findings should aid both disease modeling and the development of therapeutic approaches for the treatment of photoreceptor disorders.

Lycium barbarum glycopeptide (LbGp) is the main active component of Lycium barbarum, which can protect the kidney and promote reproduction. Autophagy and apoptosis are the regulatory mechanisms of cell adaptation to external stress. This study investigated whether DEHP and LbGp affect kidney and testis by regulating autophagy and apoptosis. DEHP induced apoptosis in human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells and human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells, as well as glomerular enlargement, enhanced renal autophagy and inflammation, decreased testicular germ cells, and enhanced testicular autophagy. LbGp reduced apoptosis in HEK-293 cells and HK-2 cells, reduced glomerular enlargement and renal inflammation, enhanced renal autophagy, increased testicular germ cells, and alleviated testicular autophagy. These results suggested that DEHP induced inflammation to cause kidney injury, mildly enhanced renal autophagy, and also induced excessive autophagy, leading to testicular injury. LbGp reduced inflammation and appropriately enhanced autophagy to alleviate renal injury and also reduced excessive autophagy to alleviate testicular injury. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1)/forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a)-mediated autophagy and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)-mediated inflammation played important roles.

Abstract: Background
The physical health and quality of life of the elderly are severely affected by osteoporosis (OP).
Methods
We explored the regulatory mechanism of ICA in vivo and in vitro by constructing OP rats and inducing osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. First, we determined the expression of miR-335–5p in bone tissues of OP patients, bone tissues of OP rats, and osteogenic BMSCs by RT-qPCR. Alizarin red staining was employed to detect the formation of calcium nodules in the cells. MTT was used to detect cell viability. Finally, we detected the bone tissue changes in OP rats by overexpression of miR-335–5p or oral ICA.
Results
miR-335–5p was lowly expressed in bone tissues of OP patients and OP rats. ICA treatment reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-335–5p inhibitor on BMSCs matrix mineralization. Moreover, PTEN was verified to be a downstream effector of miR-335–5p. During ICA induction, overexpression of PTEN reversed the promotive effect of miR-335–5p mimics on the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In vivo experiments also found that overexpression of miR-335–5p or ICA treatment improved the pathogenesis of OP in rats.
Conclusion
ICA improved OP by up-regulating miR-335–5p to inhibit PTEN, thereby providing a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of OP.

Abstract: Summary
To date, the direct causative mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced endotheliitis remains unclear. Here, we report that human ECs barely express surface ACE2, and ECs express less intracellular ACE2 than non-ECs of the lungs. We ectopically expressed ACE2 in hESC-ECs to model SARS-CoV-2 infection. ACE2-deficient ECs are resistant to the infection but are more activated than ACE2-expressing ones. The virus directly induces endothelial activation by increasing monocyte adhesion, NO production, and enhanced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK), NF-κB, and eNOS in ACE2-expressing and -deficient ECs. ACE2-deficient ECs respond to SARS-CoV-2 through TLR4 as treatment with its antagonist inhibits p38 MAPK/NF-κB/ interleukin-1β (IL-1β) activation after viral exposure. Genome-wide, single-cell RNA-seq analyses further confirm activation of the TLR4/MAPK14/RELA/IL-1β axis in circulating ECs of mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Circulating ECs could serve as biomarkers for indicating patients with endotheliitis. Together, our findings support a direct role for SARS-CoV-2 in mediating endothelial inflammation in an ACE2-dependent or -independent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Several studies have pointed to retinal involvement in COVID-19, yet many questions remain regarding the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in retinal cells and its effects on the retina. Here, we have used human pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal organoids to study retinal infection by SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in retinal organoids, as it is shown to infect different retinal lineages, such as retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors. SARS-CoV-2 infection of retinal organoids also induces the expression of several inflammatory genes, such as interleukin 33, a gene associated with acute COVID-19 and retinal degeneration. Finally, we show that the use of antibodies to block ACE2 significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection of retinal organoids, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infects retinal cells in an ACE2-dependent manner. These results suggest a retinal involvement in COVID-19 and emphasize the need to monitor retinal pathologies as potential sequelae of “long COVID.”

Abstract: Summary
Mycobacterium abscessus is an emerging and difficult-to-manage mycobacterial species that exhibits smooth (S) or rough (R) morphotypes. Disruption of glycopeptidolipid (GPL) production results in transition from S to R and severe lung disease. A structure-activity relationship study was undertaken to decipher the role of GPL glycosylation in morphotype transition and pathogenesis. Deletion of gtf3 uncovered the prominent role of the extra rhamnose in enhancing mannose receptor-mediated internalization of M. abscessus by macrophages. In contrast, the absence of the 6-deoxy-talose and the first rhamnose in mutants lacking gtf1 and gtf2, respectively, affected M abscessus phagocytosis but also resulted in the S-to-R transition. Strikingly, gtf1 and gtf2 mutants displayed a strong propensity to form cords and abscesses in zebrafish, leading to robust and lethal infection. Together, these results underscore the importance and differential contribution of GPL monosaccharides in promoting virulence and infection outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Human gastric development has not been well studied. The generation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived gastric organoids (hGOs) comprising gastric marker-expressing epithelium without an apparent smooth muscle (SM) structure has been reported. We modified previously reported protocols to generate hGOs with muscularis mucosa (MM) from hiPSCs. Time course analyses revealed that epithelium development occurred prior to MM formation. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and TGF-β1 were secreted by the epithelium. HH and TGF-β signal inhibition prevented subepithelial MM formation. A mechanical property of the substrate promoted SM differentiation around hGOs in the presence of TGF-β. TGF-β signaling was shown to influence the HH signaling and mechanical properties. In addition, clinical specimen findings suggested the involvement of TGF-β signaling in MM formation in recovering gastric ulcers. HH and TGF-β signaling from the epithelium to the stroma and the mechanical properties of the subepithelial environment may influence the emergence of MM in human stomach tissue.

Abstract: Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant rose to dominance in mid-2021, likely propelled by an estimated 40%–80% increased transmissibility over Alpha. To investigate if this ostensible difference in transmissibility is uniform across populations, we partner with public health programs from all six states in New England in the United States. We compare logistic growth rates during each variant’s respective emergence period, finding that Delta emerged 1.37–2.63 times faster than Alpha (range across states). We compute variant-specific effective reproductive numbers, estimating that Delta is 63%–167% more transmissible than Alpha (range across states). Finally, we estimate that Delta infections generate on average 6.2 (95% CI 3.1–10.9) times more viral RNA copies per milliliter than Alpha infections during their respective emergence. Overall, our evidence suggests that Delta’s enhanced transmissibility can be attributed to its innate ability to increase infectiousness, but its epidemiological dynamics may vary depending on underlying population attributes and sequencing data availability.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria carry diverse genetic systems to defend against viral infection, some of which are found within prophages where they inhibit competing viruses. Phage satellites pose additional pressures on phages by hijacking key viral elements to their own benefit. Here, we show that E. coli P2-like phages and their parasitic P4-like satellites carry hotspots of genetic variation containing reservoirs of anti-phage systems. We validate the activity of diverse systems and describe PARIS, an abortive infection system triggered by a phage-encoded anti-restriction protein. Antiviral hotspots participate in inter-viral competition and shape dynamics between the bacterial host, P2-like phages, and P4-like satellites. Notably, the anti-phage activity of satellites can benefit the helper phage during competition with virulent phages, turning a parasitic relationship into a mutualistic one. Anti-phage hotspots are present across distant species and constitute a substantial source of systems that participate in the competition between mobile genetic elements.

Abstract: In this study, it was ascertained that SNHG16 was up-regulated in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) tissues and cells, and was responsible for the aggravated malignant behaviors of GIST cells. CTCF served as a transcription activator responsible for the overexpression of SNHG16 in GIST cells. MiR-128-3p was negatively regulated by SNHG16 and exerted anti-tumor effects. Moreover, CASC3 was the direct target mRNA of miR-128-3p, through which miR-128-3p exerted function influence on GIST cell malignant behaviors. SNHG16 competitively bound with miR-128-3p against CASC3, thus positively regulating CASC3 expression. Finally, functional assays carried out in vitro proved SNHG16 could modulate GIST cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis via miR-128-3p/CASC3 axis. Animal experiments were also designed and implemented in a rescue way and evidenced that up-regulation of CASC3 countervailed the inhibitory impacts of SNHG16 silence on the progression of GIST. In summary, SNHG16 up-regulated by CTCF facilitated the progression of GIST through miR-128-3p/CASC3.

Abstract: CTP synthase (CTPS), the enzyme responsible for the last step of de novo synthesis of CTP, forms filamentous structures termed cytoophidia in all three domains of life. Here we report that oncogenic Ras regulates cytoophidium formation in Drosophila intestines. Overexpressing active Ras induces elongate and abundant cytoophidia in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and enteroblasts (EBs). Knocking-down CTPS in ISCs/EBs suppresses the over- proliferation phenotype induced by ectopic expression of active Ras. Moreover, disrupting cytoophidium formation increases the number of proliferating cells in the background of overexpressing active Ras. Therefore, our results demonstrate a link between Ras and CTPS.

Mitotic genome bookmarking by nuclear receptor VDR advocates transmission of cellular transcriptional memory to progeny cells,

Abstract: Mitosis is an essential process for the self-renewal of cells that is accompanied by dynamic changes in nuclear architecture and chromatin organization. Despite all the changes, the cell manages to re-establish all the parental epigenetic marks, post-mitotically. Recent reports suggest that some sequence-specific transcription factors remain attached to mitotic chromatin during cell division to ensure timely reactivation of a subset of transcription factors necessary to maintain cell identity. These mitotically associated factors are suggested to act as ‘genome bookmarking factors' and the phenomenon is termed ‘genome bookmarking’. Here, we studied this phenomenon with Vitamin D Receptor (VDR), a key regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. This study, for the first time, has confirmed VDR as a mitotic bookmarking factor that may be playing a crucial role in the maintenance of cell identity and genome bookmarking. Full ‘DNA binding domain (DBD)’ present in VDR was identified as essential for enrichment of VDR on mitotic chromatin. Furthermore, the study also demonstrates that VDR evokes mitotic chromatin binding behaviour in its heterodimeric partner Retinoid X receptor (RXR). Interestingly, for promoting bookmarking behaviour in RXR, both DBD and/or ligand-binding domain (LBD) in conjunction with hinge region of VDR were required. Additionally, ChIP analysis showed that VDR remains associated with DR3 (direct repeat 3) region of its specific target gene promoter CYP24A1(Cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member1), during mitosis. Altogether, our study illustrates a novel function of VDR in the epigenetic transmission and control of expression of target proteome for maintenance of cell identity and traits in progeny cells.

Abstract: Summary
Prostate cancer continuously progresses following deprivation of circulating androgens originating from the testis and adrenal glands, indicating the existence of oncometabolites beyond androgens. In this study, mass-spectrometry-based screening of clinical specimens and a retrospective analysis on the clinical data of prostate cancer patients indicate the potential oncogenic effects of progesterone in patients. High doses of progesterone activate canonical and non-canonical androgen receptor (AR) target genes. Physiological levels of progesterone facilitate cell proliferation via GATA2. Inhibitors of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (3βHSD1) has been discovered and shown to suppress the generation of progesterone, eliminating its transient and accumulating oncogenic effects. An increase in progesterone is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients and may be used as a predictive biomarker. Overall, we demonstrate that progesterone acts as an oncogenic hormone in prostate cancer, and strategies to eliminate its oncogenic effects may benefit prostate cancer patients.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in the treatment of myeloma, multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable hematological malignancy due to cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) phenotype. However, data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the CAM-DR remains scanty. Here, we identified a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in myeloma cells that are directly adherent to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Our data showed that the BMSCs up-regulated miR-30a-5p and down-regulated BCL2L11 at both mRNA and protein level in the myeloma cells. Besides, luciferase reporter genes demonstrated direct interaction between miR-30a-5p and BCL2L11 gene. Moreover, the BMSCs activated NF-ΚB signaling pathway in myeloma cells and the NF-κB P65 was shown to directly bind the miR-30a-5p promoter region. Moreover, suppression of the miR-30a-5p or upregulation of the BCL2L11 promoted apoptosis of the myeloma cells independent of the BMSCs, thus suggesting clinical significance of miR-30a-5p inhibitor and PLBCL2L11 plasmid in CAM-DR. Together, our data demonstrated the role of P65-miR-30a-5p-BCL2L11 loop in CAM-DR myeloma cells. These findings give new insights into the role of tumor microenvironment in the treatment of patients with myeloma.

Abstract: Clinical and hematological parameters can predict immune-related adverse events (irAEs) caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, the exact correlation between these parameters and irAEs is unclear. This study aimed to establish a prediction model for irAEs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ICIs. This retrospective study included patients with NSCLC treated with a minimum of one dose of ICIs at the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital and Shanxi Bethune Hospital from 2016 to 2020. Baseline characteristics, treatment details, and adverse events were evaluated. The Student's t-test, Chi-square test, and logistic regression were used to identify risk factors for irAEs to establish a prediction model. A total of 667 patients were included; the median age was 62.47 (range, 27–85) years. Most patients were men (74.5%) with stage IV cancer (93.1%). The incidence of any grade and grade 3 or higher irAEs was 21.74% (145/667) and 5.25% (35/667), respectively. A total of 145 patients experienced 220 irAEs; the incidence of endocrinopathies (35.91%, 79/220) was highest in all grade irAEs, while that of pneumonitis (7.73%, 17/220) was the highest in grade 3 or higher irAEs. A prediction model based on treatment lines, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and systemic immune inflammation index was established. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.722 (95% confidence interval: 0.650–0.793), with a cut-off value of 0.247 and a sensitivity and specificity of 62.9% and 74.6%, respectively. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of irAEs was higher in patients undergoing second-line therapy than in those undergoing treatment with adjuvant therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 8.239, p = 0.011). AST (OR = 1.053, p = 0.007) and ALC (OR = 2.556, p = 0.001) showed a positive correlation with the risk of irAEs, while LDH showed a negative correlation with irAEs (OR = 0.994, p = 0.007). The model showed good prediction efficiency, whereas the treatment lines, AST, ALC, and LDH were independent risk factors for the onset of irAEs.

Abstract: Summary
Novel strategies for prostate cancer therapy are required to overcome resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide. Here, we show that increasing 3βHSD1 after abiraterone and enzalutamide treatment is essential for drug resistance, and biochanin A (BCA), as an inhibitor of 3βHSD1, overcomes drug resistance. 3βHSD1 activity increases in cell lines, biopsy samples, and patients after long-term treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone. Enhanced steroidogenesis, mediated by 3βHSD1, is sufficient to impair enzalutamide function. In patients, accelerated abiraterone metabolism results in a decline of plasma abiraterone as disease progresses. BCA inhibits 3βHSD1 and suppresses prostate cancer development alone or together with abiraterone and enzalutamide. Daidzein, a BCA analog of dietary origin, is associated with higher plasma abiraterone concentrations and prevented prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increases in abiraterone-resistant patients. Overall, our results show that 3βHSD1 is a promising target to overcome drug resistance, and BCA suppresses disease progression as a 3βHSD1 inhibitor even after abiraterone and enzalutamide resistance.

Abstract: Kinesin-14 KIFC1 regulates spindle assembly and centrosome clustering in diverse organisms during cell division. KIFC1 proteins are essential for spindle assembly and chromosome alignment in mitosis. However, the roles and mechanisms of KIFC1 proteins in male spermatocytes remain largely unknown. In this study, we reveal that KIFC1 proteins mainly accumulate at the centrosomes and central spindle in mouse spermatocytes both in vitro and in vivo. We utilize two KIFC1 specific inhibitors, AZ82 and CW069, for the inhibition of KIFC1 in mouse spermatogenic cells and cultured GC-2 spd(ts) cells. We find that KIFC1 inhibition results in the increase of spermatocytes with micronuclei, the disorganization of the meiotic spindles, and the formation of multiple centrosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KIFC1 inhibition leads to spindle defects, chromosome misalignment and the formation of aneuploidy in cultured GC-2 spd(ts) cells. In this study, we reveal that KIFC1 proteins are critical for centrosome maintenance and chromosome stability in mouse spermatocytes.

Abstract: Summary
We present deep link prediction (DLP), a method for the interpretation of loss-of-function screens. Our approach uses representation-based link prediction to reprioritize phenotypic readouts by integrating screening experiments with gene-gene interaction networks. We validate on 2 different loss-of-function technologies, RNAi and CRISPR, using datasets obtained from DepMap. Extensive benchmarking shows that DLP-DeepWalk outperforms other methods in recovering cell-specific dependencies, achieving an average precision well above 90% across 7 different cancer types and on both RNAi and CRISPR data. We show that the genes ranked highest by DLP-DeepWalk are appreciably more enriched in drug targets compared to the ranking based on original screening scores. Interestingly, this enrichment is more pronounced on RNAi data compared to CRISPR data, consistent with the greater inherent noise of RNAi screens. Finally, we demonstrate how DLP-DeepWalk can infer the molecular mechanism through which putative targets trigger cell line mortality.

Abstract: Beta-2 Human papillomaviruses 38b, 107, and 122 have been frequently found in cervical cancer samples in western Mexico. Because their E6/E7 genes functions are not fully elucidated, we deepen into their transformation capabilities. To achieve this goal, primary human fibroblasts (FB) were transduced with E6/E7 genotype-specific viral particles. Additionally, E6/E7 from HPVs 16 and 18 were included as controls. All E6/E7-cell models increased their lifespan; however, it is important to highlight that FB-E6/E7-122 showed growth as accelerated as FB-E6/E7-16 and 18. Furthermore, both FB-E6/E7-38b and 122 exhibited abilities to migrate, and FB-E6/E7-122 presented high invasive capacity. On the other hand, ΔNp73 expression was found in all cell models, except for FB-pLVX (empty-vector). Finally, RNAseq found differentially expressed genes enriched in signaling pathways related to cell cycle, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and cancer, among others. This study shows for the first time, the great transformative potential that genotypes of the Beta-2 also possess, especially HPV122. These Beta-2 HPVs can modulate some of the genes that are well known to be regulated by Alpha-HPVs, however, they also possess alternative strategies to modulate diverse signaling pathways. These data support the idea that Beta-2 HPVs should play an important role in co-infections with Alpha-HPV during carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Neuronal migration is a highly dynamic process, and multiple cell movement metrics can be extracted from time-lapse imaging datasets. However, these parameters alone are often insufficient to evaluate the heterogeneity of neuroblast populations. We developed an analytical pipeline based on reducing the dimensions of the dataset by principal component analysis (PCA) and determining sub-populations using k-means, supported by the elbow criterion method and validated by a decision tree algorithm. We showed that neuroblasts derived from the same adult neural stem cell (NSC) lineage as well as across different lineages are heterogeneous and can be sub-divided into different clusters based on their dynamic properties. Interestingly, we also observed overlapping clusters for neuroblasts derived from different NSC lineages. We further showed that genetic perturbations or environmental stimuli affect the migratory properties of neuroblasts in a sub-cluster-specific manner. Our data thus provide a framework for assessing the heterogeneity of migrating neuroblasts.

Abstract: Summary
Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) cascades are upregulated during bone marrow-derived stromal cell (BMSC) chondrogenesis, contributing to hypertrophy and preventing effective BMSC-mediated cartilage repair. Previous work demonstrated that a proprietary BMP inhibitor prevented BMSC hypertrophy, yielding stable cartilage tissue. Because of the significant therapeutic potential of a molecule capable of hypertrophy blockade, we evaluated the capacity of a commercially available BMP type I receptor inhibitor with similar properties, LDN 193189, to prevent BMSC hypertrophy. Using 14-day microtissue chondrogenic induction cultures we found that LDN 193189 permitted BMSC chondrogenesis but did not prevent hypertrophy. LDN 193189 was sufficiently potent to counter mineralization and adipogenesis in response to exogenous BMP-2 in osteogenic induction cultures. LDN 193189 did not modify BMSC behavior in adipogenic induction cultures. Although LDN 193189 is effective in countering BMP signaling in a manner that influences BMSC fate, this blockade is insufficient to prevent hypertrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Signal transduction pathways post-translationally regulating nucleotide metabolism remain largely unknown. Guanosine monophosphate reductase (GMPR) is a nucleotide metabolism enzyme that decreases GTP pools by converting GMP to IMP. We observed that phosphorylation of GMPR at Tyr267 is critical for its activity and found that this phosphorylation by ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase EPHA4 decreases GTP pools in cell protrusions and levels of GTP-bound RAC1. EPHs possess oncogenic and tumor-suppressor activities, although the mechanisms underlying switches between these two modes are poorly understood. We demonstrated that GMPR plays a key role in EPHA4-mediated RAC1 suppression. This supersedes GMPR-independent activation of RAC1 by EPHA4, resulting in a negative overall effect on melanoma cell invasion and tumorigenicity. Accordingly, EPHA4 levels increase during melanoma progression and inversely correlate with GMPR levels in individual melanoma tumors. Therefore, phosphorylation of GMPR at Tyr267 is a metabolic signal transduction switch controlling GTP biosynthesis and transformed phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
Plant pathogens perturb their hosts to create environments suitable for their proliferation, including the suppression of immunity and promotion of water and nutrient availability. Although necrotrophs obtain water and nutrients by disrupting host-cell integrity, it is unknown whether hemibiotrophs, such as the bacterial pathogen Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii (Pnss), actively liberate water and nutrients during the early, biotrophic phase of infection. Here, we show that water and metabolite accumulation in the apoplast of Pnss-infected maize leaves precedes the disruption of host-cell integrity. Nutrient acquisition during this biotrophic phase is a dynamic process; the partitioning of metabolites into the apoplast rate limiting for their assimilation by proliferating Pnss cells. The formation of a hydrated and nutritive apoplast is driven by an AvrE-family type III effector, WtsE. Given the broad distribution of AvrE-family effectors, this work highlights the importance of actively acquiring water and nutrients for the proliferation of phytopathogenic bacteria during biotrophy.

Abstract: Inflammatory pathways represented by TLR4/NF-κB (Toll-like receptor 4/Nuclear factor-κB) axis signaling are activated in the pathogenesis of endotoxin-induced myocardial dysfunction (EIMD). However, the underlying mechanism by which NF-κB coordinates with other transcriptional coactivators/corepressors to regulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes remains unclear. We established an EIMD-mouse model by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and we discovered that NCOA1 (nuclear receptor coactivator 1) assembled with CBP (CREB binding protein) and NF-κB subunits to form a transcriptional complex that specifically bound to promoters of proinflammatory cytokine genes to activate their expression. LPS treatment also inhibited DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) expression, thereby decreasing DNA methylation of a CpG island located on the promoter of NCOA1 and causing NCOA1 overexpression. Screening small molecules that abolished NCOA1-CBP interaction in a yeast system identified a compound PSSM2126 that effectively blocked the NCOA1-CBP interaction in vitro and in vivo. Administration of PSSM2126 to EIMD mice significantly alleviated the inflammation response and improved cardiac function. Collectively, our results reveal that an NCOA1-dependent transactivation mechanism can regulate proinflammatory cytokine expression, thereby improving our understanding of the activation of NF-κB targets. The promising inhibition of the NCOA1-CBP interaction by PSSM2126 may provide a new therapeutic option for EIMD.

Abstract: Summary
Telomere integrity is critical for embryonic development, and core telomere-binding proteins, such as TIN2, are key to maintaining telomere stability. Here, we report that homozygous Tin2S341X resulted in embryonic lethality in mice and reduced expression of Tin2 in the derived mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Homozygous mutant mESCs were able to self-renew and remain undifferentiated but displayed many phenotypes associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), including excessively long and heterogeneous telomeres, increased ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies, and unstable chromosomal ends. These cells also showed upregulation of Zscan4 expression and elevated targeting of DAXX/ATRX and H3K9me3 marks on telomeres. Furthermore, the mutant mESCs were impeded in their differentiation capacity. Upon differentiation, DAXX/ATRX and PML bodies disassociated from telomeres in these cells, where elevated DNA damage was also apparent. Our results reveal differential responses to telomere dysfunction in mESCs versus differentiated cells and highlight the critical role of TIN2 in embryonic development.

Abstract: ICER is a transcriptional repressor that is mono- or poly-ubiquitinated. This either causes ICER to be translocated from the nucleus, or degraded via the proteasome, respectively. In order to further studies the proteins involved in ICER regulation mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify potential candidates. We identified twenty eight ICER-interacting proteins in human melanoma cells, Sk-Mel-24. In this study we focus on two proteins with potential roles in ICER proteasomal degradation in response to the N-end rule for ubiquitination: the N-alpha-acetyltransferase 15 (NAA15) and the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR4. Using an HA-tag on the N- or C-terminus of ICER (NHAICER or ICERCHA) it was found that the N-terminus of ICER is important for its interaction to UBR4, whereas NARG1 interaction is independent of HA-tag position. Silencing RNA experiments show that both NAA15 and UBR4 up-regulates ICER levels and that ICER's N-terminus is important for this regulation. The N-terminus of ICER was found to have dire consequences on its regulation by ubiquitination and cellular functions. The half-life of NHAICER was found to be about twice as long as ICERCHA. Polyubiquitination of ICER was found to be dependent on its N-terminus and mediated by UBR4. This data strongly suggests that ICER is ubiquitinated as a response to the N-end rule that governs protein degradation rate through recognition of the N-terminal residue of proteins. Furthermore, we found that NHAICER inhibits transcription two times more efficiently than ICERCHA, and causes apoptosis 5 times more efficiently than ICERCHA. As forced expression of ICER has been shown before to block cells in mitosis, our data represent a potentially novel mechanism for apoptosis of cells in mitotic arrest.

Abstract: The ER-resident Hsp70 paralog BiP is important in cellular homeostasis as well as in cancer cell progression. Although several BiP inhibitors have been developed, they have not succeeded in clinical trials due to toxicity issues. ER-resident co-chaperones (ERdjs) tailor the activity and specificity of BiP. Here, we report multiple-cancer analyses of BiP and ERdj genomic alterations including mRNA expression from cancer patients using available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We examine the individual roles of BiP co-chaperones ERdj1-8 in mediating anticancer drug resistance through chemogenomic screening of ERdj1-8 CRISPR KO cells. In keeping with the idea that ERdjs regulate distinct facets of proteostasis, we find that each ERdj KO displays a unique signature of drug resistance. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel way to understand functional specificity of ERdjs, suggesting a future personalized medicine approach, whereby ERdj mutation status is assessed to design an effective anticancer treatment plan.

Abstract: Background
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women populations.
Methods
RAMP2-AS1 and CXCL11 expression in breast cancer tissues and cells were determined using RT-qPCR or Western blot. RIP analysis confirmed the interaction between DNMT1, DNMT3B and RAMP2-AS1. ChIP assay verified that RAMP2-AS1 recruited DNMT1 and DNMT3B to the promoter region of CXCL11. FISH detected the sub-localization of RAMP2-AS1 in breast cancer cells. Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) tested the methylation level of CXCL11. The cell viability, proliferation, migration and apoptosis were assessed by CCK-8, colony formation, transwell and flow cytometry assays, respectively. IHC was performed to evaluate the expression of Ki67, CXCL11, MMP2 in tumor tissues.
Results
The level of RAMP2-AS1 was decreased in breast cancer tissues and cells, whereas CXCL11 was highly expressed. Patients with decreased RAMP2-AS1 had a poor prognosis. RAMP2-AS1 inhibited breast cancer cell malignant phenotype. Besides, RAMP2-AS1 regulated the methylation of CXCL11 by recruiting DNMT1 and DNMT3B to the promoter region of CXCL11. RAMP2-AS1 overexpression suppressed the malignant phenotype through CXCL11 and inhibited tumor growth in vivo.
Conclusion
RAMP2-AS1 suppresses breast cancer malignant phenotype via DNMT1 and DNMT3B mediated inhibition of CXCL11.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in cellular reprogramming have radically increased the use of patient-derived cells for neurological research in vitro. However, adherence of human neurons on tissue cultureware is unreliable over the extended periods required for electrophysiological maturation. Adherence issues are particularly prominent for transferable glass coverslips, hindering imaging and electrophysiological assays. Here, we assessed thin-film plasma polymer treatments, polymeric factors, and extracellular matrix coatings for extending the adherence of human neuronal cultures on glass. We find that positive-charged, amine-based plasma polymers improve the adherence of a range of human brain cells. Diaminopropane (DAP) treatment with laminin-based coating optimally supports long-term maturation of fundamental ion channel properties and synaptic activity of human neurons. As proof of concept, we demonstrated that DAP-treated glass is ideal for live imaging, patch-clamping, and optogenetics. A DAP-treated glass surface reduces the technical variability of human neuronal models and enhances electrophysiological maturation, allowing more reliable discoveries of treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to precisely edit the genome of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines using CRISPR/Cas9 has enabled the development of cellular models that can address genotype to phenotype relationships. While genome editing is becoming an essential tool in iPSC-based disease modeling studies, there is no established quality control workflow for edited cells. Moreover, large on-target deletions and insertions that occur through DNA repair mechanisms have recently been uncovered in CRISPR/Cas9-edited loci. Yet the frequency of these events in human iPSCs remains unclear, as they can be difficult to detect. We examined 27 iPSC clones generated after targeting 9 loci and found that 33% had acquired large, on-target genomic defects, including insertions and loss of heterozygosity. Critically, all defects had escaped standard PCR and Sanger sequencing analysis. We describe a cost-efficient quality control strategy that successfully identified all edited clones with detrimental on-target events and could facilitate the integrity of iPSC-based studies.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-based therapies face challenges, including poor cell survival, immune rejection, and integration into pathologic tissue. We conducted an open-label phase 1/2a clinical trial to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of a subretinal implant consisting of a polarized monolayer of allogeneic human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells in subjects with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry age-related macular degeneration. Postmortem histology from one subject with very advanced disease shows the presence of donor RPE cells 2 years after implantation by immunoreactivity for RPE65 and donor-specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules. Markers of RPE cell polarity and phagocytosis suggest donor RPE function. Further histologic examination demonstrated CD34+ structures beneath the implant and CD4+, CD68+, and FoxP3+ cells in the tissue. Despite significant donor-host HLA mismatch, no clinical signs of retinitis, vitreitis, vasculitis, choroiditis, or serologic immune response were detected in the deceased subject or any other subject in the study. Subretinally implanted, HLA-mismatched donor RPE cells survive, express functional markers, and do not elicit clinically detectable intraocular inflammation or serologic immune responses even without long-term immunosuppression.

Abstract: Summary
High atmospheric humidity levels profoundly impact host-pathogen interactions in plants by enabling the establishment of an aqueous living space that benefits pathogens. The effectors HopM1 and AvrE1 of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae have been shown to induce an aqueous apoplast under such conditions. However, the mechanisms by which this happens remain unknown. Here, we show that HopM1 and AvrE1 work redundantly to establish an aqueous living space by inducing a major reprogramming of the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome landscape. These effectors induce a strong abscisic acid (ABA) signature, which promotes stomatal closure, resulting in reduced leaf transpiration and water-soaking lesions. Furthermore, these effectors preferentially increase ABA accumulation in guard cells, which control stomatal aperture. Notably, a guard-cell-specific ABA transporter, ABCG40, is necessary for HopM1 induction of water-soaking lesions. This study provides molecular insights into a chain of events of stomatal manipulation that create an ideal microenvironment to facilitate infection.

Abstract: Summary
Previously either regarded as insignificant or feared as potential sources of infection, the bacteria living on our skin are increasingly recognized for their role in benefitting human health. Skin commensals modulate mucosal immune defenses and directly interfere with pathogens; however, their contribution to the skin’s physical integrity is less understood. Here, we show that the abundant skin commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis contributes to skin barrier integrity. S. epidermidis secretes a sphingomyelinase that acquires essential nutrients for the bacteria and assists the host in producing ceramides, the main constituent of the epithelial barrier that averts skin dehydration and aging. In mouse models, S. epidermidis significantly increases skin ceramide levels and prevents water loss of damaged skin in a fashion entirely dependent on its sphingomyelinase. Our findings reveal a symbiotic mechanism that demonstrates an important role of the skin microbiota in the maintenance of the skin’s protective barrier.

Abstract: Summary
Phytopathogens like Pseudomonas syringae induce “water soaking” in the apoplastic space of plant leaf tissue as a key virulence mechanism. Water soaking is commonly observed in diverse pathosystems, yet the underlying physiological basis remains largely elusive. Here, we show that one of the strong P. syringae water-soaking inducers, AvrE, alters the regulation of abscisic acid (ABA) to induce ABA signaling, stomatal closure, and, thus, water soaking. AvrE binds and inhibits the function of Arabidopsis type one protein phosphatases (TOPPs), which negatively regulate ABA by suppressing SnRK2s, a key node of the ABA signaling pathway. The topp12537 quintuple mutants display significantly enhanced water soaking after P. syringae inoculation, whereas the loss of the ABA pathway dampens P. syringae-induced water soaking and disease. Our study uncovers the hijacking of ABA signaling and stomatal closure by P. syringae effectors as key mechanisms of disease susceptibility.

Abstract: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) constitute an important multifunctional enzyme family that plays vital roles in cellular detoxification and protecting organisms against oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we isolated a GST-like gene from Apis cerana cerana (AccGSTL) and investigated its antioxidant functions under stress conditions. We found that AccGSTL belongs to the Sigma class of GSTs. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting analyses showed that the mRNA and protein levels of AccGSTL were altered in response to oxidative stress caused by various external stimuli. In addition, a heterologous expression analysis showed that AccGSTL overexpression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. After AccGSTL silencing with RNA interference (RNAi) technology, the expression of some antioxidant genes was inhibited, and the enzymatic activities of POD, CAT, and SOD were decreased. In conclusion, these data suggest that AccGSTL may be involved in antioxidant defense under adverse conditions in A. cerana cerana.

Abstract: Background
Choriocarcinoma (CC) is a highly aggressive malignant tumor that mostly occurs in women of childbearing age. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for CC, but it has side effects and causes drug resistance, which can lead to treatment failure. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) that deliver microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a novel and promising therapeutic tool for inhibiting tumor progression and metastasis. This research aimed to study the effects of miR-127-3p-enriched EVs (EV-miR-127-3p) on CC and underlying mechanisms.
Methods
Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were performed to determine the miR-127-3p and integrin subunit alpha-6 (ITGA6) expression levels. The interaction between miR-127-3p and ITGA6 was confirmed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) were identified using flow cytometry and multilineage differentiation. Uptake of labeled EVs was demonstrated using immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry assays. EV-miR-127-3p were isolated from the culture medium of hUCMSCs and co-cultured with JEG-3 or JAR cells to evaluate their effects on cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis, using the cell counting kit-8, Transwell, and flow cytometry assays. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad pathway were investigated using qRT-PCR and western blotting.
Results
The expression of miR-127-3p was downregulated, while that of ITGA6 was upregulated in CC cell lines. ITGA6 was identified as a target gene of miR-127-3p. EV-miR-127-3p could inhibit the proliferation, invasion, migration, and promote the apoptosis of CC cells. We observed that EV-miR-127-3p suppressed EMT of CC cells by targeting ITGA6. In addition, the knockdown of ITGA6 inhibited the TGF-β1/Smad pathway and reversed the EMT-promoting effect.
Conclusion
These results indicate that EV-miR-127-3p from hUCMSCs exhibits anti-tumor effects by targeting ITGA6, which may be used as a novel therapeutic strategy for CC treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis is associated with impairment of cellular function in diverse diseases, especially the function of pancreatic β cells in type 2 diabetes. Restoration of ER proteostasis by small molecules shows therapeutic promise for type 2 diabetes. Here, using cell-based screening, we report identification of a chemical chaperone-like small molecule, KM04794, that alleviates ER stress. KM04794 prevented protein aggregation and cell death caused by ER stressors and a mutant insulin protein. We also found that this compound increased intracellular and secreted insulin levels in pancreatic β cells. Chemical biology and biochemical approaches revealed that the compound accumulated in the ER and interacted directly with the ER molecular chaperone BiP. Our data show that this corrector of ER proteostasis can enhance insulin storage and pancreatic β cell function.

Abstract: Glioma is one of the most common malignancies. De novo serine synthesis promotes glioma progression and therapeutic resistance. Therefore, clarifying the regulatory mechanism of serine synthesis is of great significance for glioma therapy. In this study, we found that the expression of TFCP2 was upregulated in glioma and that TFCP2 promoted glioma cell growth and sphere formation. Knockdown of TFCP2 expression inhibited glioma cell growth, sphere formation and tumorigenicity in nude mice. In terms of its molecular mechanism, TFCP2 was found to interact with ATF3 to cooperatively regulate the de novo synthesis of serine. Knockdown of TFCP2 expression significantly inhibited the binding of ATF3 to the promoter of PHGDH (a rate-limiting enzyme in the serine synthesis process). In conclusion, our studies proved that TFCP2 jointly regulates the de novo synthesis of serine through interaction with ATF3, thus promoting glioma progression. This study suggests that TFCP2 is a potential target for glioma therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA vaccines offer protection against COVID-19; however, multiple variant lineages caused widespread breakthrough infections. Here, we generate LNP-mRNAs specifically encoding wild-type (WT), B.1.351, and B.1.617 SARS-CoV-2 spikes, and systematically study their immune responses. All three LNP-mRNAs induced potent antibody and T cell responses in animal models; however, differences in neutralization activity have been observed between variants. All three vaccines offer potent protection against in vivo challenges of authentic viruses of WA-1, Beta, and Delta variants. Single-cell transcriptomics of WT- and variant-specific LNP-mRNA-vaccinated animals reveal a systematic landscape of immune cell populations and global gene expression. Variant-specific vaccination induces a systemic increase of reactive CD8 T cells and altered gene expression programs in B and T lymphocytes. BCR-seq and TCR-seq unveil repertoire diversity and clonal expansions in vaccinated animals. These data provide assessment of efficacy and direct systems immune profiling of variant-specific LNP-mRNA vaccination in vivo.

Abstract: Background
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been implicated in OS pathogenesis. In the current study, we explored the precise role of circRNA cyclin dependent kinase 14 (circ-CDK14, hsa_circ_0001721) in OS progression.
Methods
The levels of circ-CDK14, miR-198 and E2F transcription factor 2 (E2F2) were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were determined using the Cell Counting-8 Kit (CCK-8), flow cytometry and transwell assays, respectively. Glucose consumption, lactate production and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level were gauged using the commercial assay kits. The direct relationship between miR-198 and circ-CDK14 or E2F2 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter, RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Animal studies were used to analyze the role of circ-CDK14 in vivo.
Results
Our data revealed that circ-CDK14 was up-regulated and miR-198 was down-regulated in OS tissues and cell lines. Circ-CDK14 silencing suppressed OS cell viability, migration, invasion, and glycolysis and promoted cell apoptosis in vitro, as well as diminished tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, circ-CDK14 directly targeted miR-198. Moreover, miR-198 was a functional mediator of circ-CDK14 in regulating OS cell progression in vitro. E2F2 was a direct target of miR-198, and miR-198 overexpression regulated OS cell progression in vitro by down-regulating E2F2. Furthermore, circ-CDK14 regulated E2F2 expression by functioning as a sponge of miR-198 in OS cells.
Conclusion
Our findings demonstrate the inhibitory effect of circ-CDK14 silencing on OS progression by targeting the miR-198/E2F2 axis, establishing a strong rationale for decreasing circ-CDK14 as a novel therapeutic strategy for OS.

Abstract: Invasive melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with high incidence of mortality. The process of tumor invasion is a crucial primary step in the metastatic cascade, yet the mechanisms involved are still under investigation. Here we document a critical role for MLK3 (MAP3K11) in the regulation of melanoma cell invasion. We report the unexpected finding that cellular loss of MLK3 in melanoma cells promotes cell invasion. Cellular depletion of MLK3 expression results in the hyperactivation of ERK, which is linked to the formation of a BRAF/Hsp90/Cdc37 protein complex. ERK hyperactivation leads to enhanced phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β and the stabilization of c-Jun and JNK activity. Blocking of ERK and JNK signaling as well as Hsp90 activity downstream of MLK3-silencing significantly reduces melanoma invasion. Furthermore, ERK activation in the aforementioned context is coupled to MT1-MMP transcription as well as the TOM1L1-dependent localization of the membrane protease to invadopodia at the invasive front. These studies provide critical insight into the mechanisms that couple MLK3 loss with BRAF hyperactivation and its consequence on melanoma invasion.

Abstract: Rab22a, a member of the proto-oncogene RAS family, belongs to the Rab5 subfamily. It participates in early endosome formation and regulates vesicle trafficking. The relationship between Rab22a and tumorigenesis remains elusive. In non-small cell lung cancer specimens, immunohistochemical staining showed consistently high expression of Rab22a in lung adenocarcinoma, but not in squamous cell carcinoma. In lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549 and H1299, transfection with Rab22a significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas interference with Rab22a specific siRNA significantly inhibited the above capacities. Transfection with Rab22a also up-regulated the phosphorylation levels of core effector proteins on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The Co-IP assay further confirmed the interaction between Rab22a and PI3Kp85α, the core regulatory subunit of PI3K. Application of rapamycin, the mTOR inhibitor, significantly reduced the upregulation of the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of lung adenocarcinoma cells transfected with Rab22a. These results suggest that Rab22a can promote the malignant phenotype of lung adenocarcinoma by upregulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and may function as a potential anti-tumor therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Limb transplantation is a life-changing procedure for amputees. However, limb recipients have a 6-fold greater rejection rate than solid organ transplant recipients, related in part to greater immunogenicity of the skin. Here, we report a detailed immunological and molecular characterization of individuals who underwent bilateral limb transplantation at our institution. Circulating Th17 cells are increased in limb transplant recipients over time. Molecular characterization of 770 genes in skin biopsies reveals upregulation of T cell effector immune molecules and chemokines, particularly CCL18. Skin antigen-presenting cells primarily express the chemokine CCL18, which binds to the CCR8 receptor. CCL18 treatment recruits more allo-T cells to the skin xenograft in a humanized skin transplantation model, leading to signs of accelerated graft rejection. Blockade of CCR8 remarkedly decreases CCL18-induced allo-T cell infiltration. Our results suggest that targeting the CCL18:CCR8 pathway could be a promising immunosuppressive approach in transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a powerful and increasingly popular technique to explore the regulatory landscape of heterogeneous cellular populations. However, the high noise levels, degree of sparsity, and scale of the generated data make its analysis challenging. Here, we present PeakVI, a probabilistic framework that leverages deep neural networks to analyze scATAC-seq data. PeakVI fits an informative latent space that preserves biological heterogeneity while correcting batch effects and accounting for technical effects, such as library size and region-specific biases. In addition, PeakVI provides a technique for identifying differential accessibility at a single-region resolution, which can be used for cell-type annotation as well as identification of key cis-regulatory elements. We use public datasets to demonstrate that PeakVI is scalable, stable, robust to low-quality data, and outperforms current analysis methods on a range of critical analysis tasks. PeakVI is publicly available and implemented in the scvi-tools framework.

Abstract: Summary
Endometriosis is associated with increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs). Using data from large endometriosis and EOC genome-wide association meta-analyses, we estimate the genetic correlation and evaluate the causal relationship between genetic liability to endometriosis and EOC histotypes, and identify shared susceptibility loci. We estimate a significant genetic correlation (rg) between endometriosis and clear cell (rg = 0.71), endometrioid (rg = 0.48), and high-grade serous (rg = 0.19) ovarian cancer, associations supported by Mendelian randomization analyses. Bivariate meta-analysis identified 28 loci associated with both endometriosis and EOC, including 19 with evidence for a shared underlying association signal. Differences in the shared risk suggest different underlying pathways may contribute to the relationship between endometriosis and the different histotypes. Functional annotation using transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of relevant tissues/cells highlights several target genes. This comprehensive analysis reveals profound genetic overlap between endometriosis and EOC histotypes with valuable genomic targets for understanding the biological mechanisms linking the diseases.

Abstract: Summary
RNA Bind-n-Seq (RBNS) is a cost-effective, high-throughput method capable of identifying the sequence preferences of RNA-binding proteins and of qualitatively defining relative dissociation constants. Although RBNS is often described as an unbiased method, several factors may influence the outcome of the analysis. Here, we discuss these biases and present an analytical strategy to estimate absolute binding affinities from RBNS data, extend RBNS to kinetic studies, and develop a framework to compute relative association and dissociation rate constants. As proof of principle, we measured the equilibrium binding properties of mammalian Argonaute2 (AGO2) guided by eight microRNAs (miRNAs) and kinetic parameters for let-7a. The miRNA-binding site repertoires, dissociation constants, and kinetic parameters calculated from RBNS data using our methods correlate well with values measured by traditional ensemble and single-molecule approaches. Our data provide additional quantitative measurements for Argonaute-bound miRNA binding that should facilitate development of quantitative targeting rules for individual miRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatase PPM1F is a regulator of cell adhesion by fine-tuning integrin activity and actin cytoskeleton structures. Elevated expression of this enzyme in human tumors is associated with high invasiveness, enhanced metastasis, and poor prognosis. Thus, PPM1F is a target for pharmacological intervention, yet inhibitors of this enzyme are lacking. Here, we use high-throughput screening to identify Lockdown, a reversible and non-competitive PPM1F inhibitor. Lockdown is selective for PPM1F, because this compound does not inhibit other protein phosphatases in vitro and does not induce additional phenotypes in PPM1F knockout cells. Importantly, Lockdown-treated glioblastoma cells fully re-capitulate the phenotype of PPM1F-deficient cells as assessed by increased phosphorylation of PPM1F substrates and corruption of integrin-dependent cellular processes. Ester modification yields LockdownPro with increased membrane permeability and prodrug-like properties. LockdownPro suppresses tissue invasion by PPM1F-overexpressing human cancer cells, validating PPM1F as a therapeutic target and providing an access point to control tumor cell dissemination.

Abstract: The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and metastasis formation in multiple cancers. However, the biological significance of RNA m6A reader IGF2BP1 and the modification of IGF2BP1 itself have not been fully investigated. Here, we analyzed the functions and mechanism of IGF2BP1 in gastric cancer (GC). Results showed that IGF2BP1 upregulated in GC tissue and acted as a predictor of poor prognosis for GC patients. Functionally, IGF2BP1 promoted the migration and aerobic glycolysis of GC cells in vitro. Moreover, IGF2BP1 knockdown repressed the tumor growth in vivo. We also demonstrated that IGF2BP1 directly interacted with c-MYC mRNA via m6A-dependent manner to by stabilize its stability. Overall, these findings demonstrated that m6A reader IGF2BP1 facilitated the carcinogenic of GC in m6A/c-Myc-dependent manner, which might provide critical therapeutic strategy for GC.

Abstract: Because MSC-NTF has a higher ability to secrete neurotrophic factors, it may have a greater potential than ordinary MSC in clinical applications. At present, research on MSC-NTF mainly focuses on clinical aspects, but its basic research is relatively few. In particular, the research on the comprehensive and detailed characteristics of MSC-NTF is missing. And its in vivo research in animals is also rare. Since the transplantation of human-derived MSC-NTF into rats is cross-species, its survival in the rat and the therapeutic effect may be seriously affected due to severe immune rejection. This will inevitably affect the research on the basic characteristics and the therapeutic mechanisms of MSC-NTF in vivo. Therefore, we chose the rat-derived MSCs to be induced as the MSC-NTF which had a stronger neurotrophic factor secretion function. This will also be helpful to perform the research of the basic therapeutic mechanisms of MSC-NTF in vivo. In addition, we have established some important characteristics that can be used to distinguish between MSC-NTF and MSCs: different multi-factor secretion ability and secretion characteristics, immunogenicity, three-line differentiation ability, stemness, etc. In addition to paying attention to their safety differences, this study also explored the differences in their in vivo survivability.

Abstract: Summary
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) therapy development is hamstrung by a lack of susceptibility, diagnostic, and prognostic biomarkers. Blood neurofilament light (NfL) shows promise as a biomarker, but studies have largely focused only on core FTD syndromes, often grouping patients with different diagnoses. To expedite the clinical translation of NfL, we avail ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) study resources and conduct a comprehensive investigation of plasma NfL across FTD syndromes and in presymptomatic FTD mutation carriers. We find plasma NfL is elevated in all studied syndromes, including mild cases; increases in presymptomatic mutation carriers prior to phenoconversion; and associates with indicators of disease severity. By facilitating the identification of individuals at risk of phenoconversion, and the early diagnosis of FTD, plasma NfL can aid in participant selection for prevention or early treatment trials. Moreover, its prognostic utility would improve patient care, clinical trial efficiency, and treatment outcome estimations.

Abstract: Summary
Developmental, homeostatic, and pharmacological pro-apoptotic signals converge by activating the BCL-2 family member BAX. Studies investigating molecular regulation of BAX are commonly limited to methodologies measuring endpoint phenotypes and do not assess activation of monomeric BAX. Here, we present FLAMBE, a fluorescence polarization ligand assay for monitoring BAX early activation, that measures activation-induced release of a peptide probe in real time. Using complementary parallel and tandem biochemical techniques, we validate, corroborate, and apply FLAMBE to a contemporary repertoire of BAX modulators, characterizing their contributions within the early steps of BAX activation. Additionally, we use FLAMBE to reveal that historically “dead” BAX mutants remain responsive to activation as quasi-functional monomers. We also identify data metrics for comparative analyses and demonstrate that FLAMBE data align with downstream functional observations. Collectively, FLAMBE advances our understanding of BAX activation and fills a methodological void for studying BAX with broad applications in cell biology and therapeutic development.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian microbiome encodes numerous secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters; yet, their role in microbe-microbe interactions is unclear. Here, we characterized two polyketide synthase gene clusters (fun and pks) in the gut symbiont Limosilactobacillus reuteri. The pks, but not the fun, cluster encodes antimicrobial activity. Forty-one of 51 L. reuteri strains tested are sensitive to Pks products; this finding was independent of strains’ host origin. Sensitivity to Pks was also established in intraspecies competition experiments in gnotobiotic mice. Comparative genome analyses between Pks-resistant and -sensitive strains identified an acyltransferase gene (act) unique to Pks-resistant strains. Subsequent cell-wall analysis of wild-type and act mutant strains showed that Act acetylates cell-wall components, providing resistance to Pks-mediated killing. Additionally, pks mutants lost their competitive advantage, while act mutants lost their Pks resistance in in vivo competition assays. These findings provide insight into how closely related gut symbionts can compete and co-exist in the gastrointestinal tract.

Abstract: Serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2) is a key enzyme that regulates serine/glycine transition; however, its specific function and molecular mechanisms in tumors remain controversial. In this study, we aimed to enhance the understanding in this regard. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, as well as data analyses using public databases, we investigated the effect of SHMT2 in prostate cancer. Our results indicated that SHMT2 acts as a prostate cancer tumor proliferation suppressor and negatively regulates the aggressive behavior of prostate cancer through activation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Additionally, downregulated SHMT2 expression was observed in more advanced prostate cancer phenotypes, and further analysis showed that its depletion promoted proliferation and migration in prostate cancer cell lines. Taken together, our results revealed the function of SHMT2 in prostate cancer and may potentially play a role in the exploration of new therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: The tumor-suppressing role of miR-455-3p has been reported in lung cancer, but the working mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. This study aims to explore the possible mechanism of miR-455-3p in regulating epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression and angiogenesis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. The expressions of miR-455-3p, HSF1, GLS1, and EMT-related proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, and Snail-1) in both NSCLC tissues and cell lines were determined by RT-qPCR and western blot. After cell transfection, cell proliferation and angiogenesis ability on NSCLC cells were assessed by MTT and tube formation assay. The binding of miR-455-3p with HSF1 was measured by luciferase reporter gene assay, while the interaction between HSF1 and GLS1 was determined by co-immunoprecipitation assay (Co-IP). HSF1 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cells. Inhibition of HSF1 expression or overexpression of miR-455-3p in NSCLC cells can suppress cell proliferation, angiogenesis ability, and EMT progression. miR-455-3p was found to negatively regulate HSF1 expression. Co-transfection of miR-455-3p overexpression and HSF1 inhibition in NSCLC cells showed that miR-455-3p can partially counteract the effect of HSF1 in NSCLC cells. HSF1 can interact with GLS1 and elevate the expression of GLS1. GLS1 can partially abolish the suppressive effect of miR-455-3p in NSCLC cells. miR-455-3p can bind HSF1 to suppress the GLS1 in NSCLC cells, therefore suppressing EMT progression and angiogenesis of NSCLC cells.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are fundamental but complex determinants for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. However, the factors involved in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism in HSCs and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Here, we identify sterol regulatory element binding factor-1c (Srebf1c) as a key factor in maintaining HSC biology under both steady-state and stress conditions. Srebf1c knockout (Srebf1c−/−) mice display increased phenotypic HSCs and less HSC quiescence. In addition, Srebf1c deletion compromises the function and survival of HSCs in competitive transplantation or following chemotherapy and irradiation. Mechanistically, SREBF1c restrains the excessive activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and mitochondrial metabolism in HSCs by regulating the expression of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1). Our study demonstrates that Srebf1c plays an important role in regulating HSC fate via the TSC1-mTOR-mitochondria axis.

Abstract: Summary
Growing evidence implicates the gut microbiome in cognition. Viruses, the most abundant life entities on the planet, are a commonly overlooked component of the gut virome, dominated by the Caudovirales and Microviridae bacteriophages. Here, we show in a discovery (n = 114) and a validation cohort (n = 942) that subjects with increased Caudovirales and Siphoviridae levels in the gut microbiome had better performance in executive processes and verbal memory. Conversely, increased Microviridae levels were linked to a greater impairment in executive abilities. Microbiota transplantation from human donors with increased specific Caudovirales (>90% from the Siphoviridae family) levels led to increased scores in the novel object recognition test in mice and up-regulated memory-promoting immediate early genes in the prefrontal cortex. Supplementation of the Drosophila diet with the 936 group of lactococcal Siphoviridae bacteriophages resulted in increased memory scores and upregulation of memory-involved brain genes. Thus, bacteriophages warrant consideration as novel actors in the microbiome-brain axis.

Abstract: Summary
As single- and mixed-species biofilms, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cause difficult-to-eradicate chronic infections. In P. aeruginosa, pseudomonas quinolone (PQS)-dependent quorum sensing regulates virulence and biofilm development that can be attenuated via antagonists targeting the transcriptional regulator PqsR (MvfR). Here, we exploited a quinazolinone (QZN) library including PqsR agonists and antagonists for their activity against S. aureus alone, when co-cultured with P. aeruginosa, and in combination with the aminoglycoside tobramycin. The PqsR inhibitor, QZN 34 killed planktonic Gram-positives but not Gram-negatives. QZN 34 prevented S. aureus biofilm formation, severely damaged established S. aureus biofilms, and perturbed P. aeruginosa biofilm development. Although P. aeruginosa protected S. aureus from tobramycin in mixed biofilms, the combination of aminoglycoside antibiotic with QZN 34 eradicated the mixed-species biofilm. The mechanism of action of QZN 34 toward Gram-positive bacteria is shown to involve membrane perturbation and dissipation of transmembrane potential.

Abstract: Various types of cells secrete extracellular vesicle (EVs) which contain proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and play important roles in inter-cellular signalling and pathological processes to impact the recipient cells. EVs have demonstrated their potential as biomarkers for disease and as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. In recent times, EVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are widely used as a promising medicinal product in many clinical applications, are being tested in many preclinical trials. However, the lack of standardization of MSC-derived EV isolation and analysis methods, restricts the utility of MSC-derived EVs in the clinical setting. Here, we focused on optimising the isolation method for EVs derived from MSCs. Four samples of EVs were isolated from human adipose derived MSC culture medium by differential ultracentrifugation with three different ultracentrifuge durations to investigate the influence of ultracentrifuge time on quality and quantity of MSC-derived EVs. Additionally, we used a commercial kit to extract EVs from MSC cultured medium and compared it with the ultracentrifugation method. The EV samples were then characterised for particle concentration, protein concentration, size distribution and the presence of known EV protein markers, by western blot and flow cytometry. A comparison of these results for the five samples demonstrated that 1 h of differential ultracentrifugation was optimal to isolate high quality and quantity of MSC-derived EVs from MSC cultured medium. Additionally, fluorescence imaging of the freshly isolated vs frozen EVs showed that freshly isolated EVs are taken up by cells more efficiently than frozen EVs. These finding establish a simple and reliable method of EV isolation from MSCs.

Abstract: Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in numerous virus variants, some of which have altered receptor-binding or antigenic phenotypes. Here, we quantify the degree to which adaptive evolution is driving the accumulation of mutations across the genome. We correlate clade growth with mutation accumulation, compare rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence, assess temporal clustering of mutations, and evaluate the evolutionary success of individual mutations. We find that spike S1 is the focus of adaptive evolution but also identify positively selected mutations in other proteins (notably Nsp6) that are sculpting the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Adaptive changes in S1 accumulated rapidly, resulting in a remarkably high ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence that is 2.5× greater than that observed in influenza hemagglutinin HA1 at the beginning of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. These findings uncover a high degree of adaptation in S1 and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might undergo antigenic drift.

Abstract: The study aimed to explore the effects of normal CESC-derived exosomes (N-CESC-exo) on autophagy, apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and their underlying molecular mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. Tert-buty l hydroperoxide (TBHP) was used to induce CESCs and NPCs degeneration models in vitro. Flow cytometry and TUNEL staining were used to assess apoptosis. Proteins expression were detected by Western blotting. qRT-PCR was applied to detect miR-125-5p and SUV39H1 expression. The miRNA differences were analyzed by bioinformatics. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was applied to detect the target relationship. The degeneration of intervertebral disc tissue was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. The disc damage was assessed with Safranin-O and Fast Green staining. LC3B expression was detected by immunofluorescence. We observed that NPCs could ingest N-CESC-exo. N-CESC-exo reduced degenerated nucleus pulposus cells (TBHP-NPC) apoptosis, bax, MMP13, and p62 expression, while increased bcl2, ACAN, LC3-II/I expression, and the fluorescence intensity of GFP-LC3. Bioinformatics analysis confirmed that miR-125-5p was low expression, while SUV39H1 was overexpressed in IDD. Further, the dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed the targeting relationship between miR-125-5p and SUV39H1. CESC-exomiR−125−5p inhibited TBHP-NPCs apoptosis by inhibiting SUV39H1, bax, MMP13, and p62 expression, while increased bcl2, ACAN, LC3-II/I expression, and the fluorescence intensity of GFP-LC3, thereby alleviating rat IDD.

Abstract: Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4), a multifunctional matricellular protein, is involved in regulation of angiogenesis, innate immunity, inflammation, tumorigenesis and metastasis formation via modulation of important cellular processes like adhesion, proliferation, differentiation as well as apoptosis. In our previous work we demonstrated the upregulation of OLFM4 during liver regeneration and cutaneous wound healing. Here we studied the outcomes of OLFM4 downregulation in human immortalized keratinocytes – the HaCaT cells. The suppression of OLFM4 inhibited migration but enhanced the proliferation of these cells. By using proteomic, and phosphoproteomic analysis, we found that OLFM4 downregulation induced changes in the levels of 184 proteins and 348 phosphosites. An integrated pathway analysis suggested that the increased phosphorylation of CDK7 at Ser164 and Thr170 may serve as the key event in the activation of CDK2 and consequent activation of cell cycle progression. Furthermore, the decrease in GIT1 and WAVE2 protein levels were connected to the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, reduction of lamellipodia formation at the leading edge of HaCaT cells, and decrease in their migration capacity.

Abstract: At present, heat stress caused by the thermal environment is the main factor that endangers the reproductive function of animals. Growth hormone (GH) is a polypeptide hormone, the biological function of reproductive organs has been reported, and it has many important physiological functions in the body. However, so far, the behavior and signal transduction of GH in testicular cells under heat stress are still unclear. To this end, in the current work, we use a swine testicular cell line (ST) as an in vitro model to explore the cell behavior and intracellular signaling profile of porcine growth hormone (pGH) under heat stress; the results showed that when cells were under heat stress, pGH and GHR were basically not internalized, and a large number of them accumulated on the cell membrane. In addition, we also studied the effect of pGH on the JAK2-STATs signaling pathway and IGF-1 expression under heat stress, we found that the ability of pGH to activate the JAK-STATs signaling pathway and IGF-1 under heat stress was greatly reduced (p < 0.05). In conclusion, our research shows that when cells undergo heat stress, the internalization of pGH and GHR were inhibited, and the activation of the JAK2-STATs signaling pathway and IGF-1 expression were reduced; this lays a solid foundation for further research on the effect of pGH on swine testicular tissue under thermal environment.

Abstract: Nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) is mainly expressed in tumor microenvironment, especially in macrophages. However, whether NFATc1 is involved in the polarization of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor progression in cervical cancer (CC) remains unclear. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of CD68 and NFATc1 in CC tissues or adjacent normal tissues of patients. RT-qPCR, flow cytometry, ELISA, and inhibitors treatment were used to observe the effect of NFATc1 on TAMs polarization. Clonal formation, scratch, and transwell assays were used to examine the effects of NFATc1-transfected macrophages or NFATc1-transfected TAM on tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. Further, a xenograft model was established to confirm the roles of NFATc1+ TAM in CC tumorigenesis. NFATc1+CD68+/CD68+ TAMs ratio was significantly increased in CC tissues compared with the normal tissue, and NFATc1+ TAM showed an M2-like TAM subtype. NFATc1 induced macrophages to secrete IL-10, which further induced M2 polarization of macrophages. Mechanically, the c-myc-PKM2 pathway mediated the expression of IL-10 in NFATc1-induced macrophages. Functionally, NFATc1 induced M2 macrophages promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CC cells, and the knockout of NFATc1 in TAMs significantly inhibited the tumor-promoting function of TAMs. Further, the tumorigenesis test in nude mice confirmed that NFATc1+ TAM promoted the tumorigenicity of CC cells in vivo. In conclusion, NFATc1 mediated IL-10 secretion by regulating the c-myc/PKM2 pathway, thereby inducing M2 polarization of TAMs and promoting the progression of CC.

Abstract: Summary
Using the Drosophila melanogaster Hox gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) as an example, we demonstrate the use of three heterologous DNA-binding protein systems—LacI/LacO, ParB1/ParS1, and ParB2/ParS2—to label genomic loci in imaginal discs with the insertion of a small DNA tag. We compare each system, considering the impact of labeling in genomic regions (1) inside versus outside of a transcribed gene body and (2) with varying chromatin accessibility. We demonstrate the value of this system by interrogating the relationship between gene expression level and enhancer-promoter distance, as well as inter-allelic distance at the Ubx locus. We find that the distance between an essential intronic cis-regulatory element, anterobithorax (abx), and the promoter does not vary with expression level. In contrast, inter-allelic distance correlates with Ubx expression level.

Abstract: LIM-homeobox genes play multiple roles in developmental processes, but their roles in gonad development are not completely understood. Herein, we report that Lhx2, Ils2, Lmx1a, and Lmx1b are expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner in mouse, rat, and human gonads during sex determination. Amongst these, Lhx2 has female biased expression in the developing gonads of species with environmental and genetic modes of sex determination. Single-cell RNAseq analysis revealed that Lhx2 is exclusively expressed in the germ cells of the developing mouse ovaries. To elucidate the roles of Lhx2 in the germ cells, we analyzed the phenotypes of Lhx2 knockout XX gonads. While the gonads developed appropriately in Lhx2 knockout mice and the somatic cells were correctly specified in the developing ovaries, transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment of genes in the angiogenesis pathway. There was an elevated expression of several pro-angiogenic factors in the Lhx2 knockout ovaries. The elevated expression of pro-angiogenic factors was associated with an increase in numbers of endothelial cells in the Lhx2−/− ovaries at E13.5. Gonad recombination assays revealed that the increased numbers of endothelial cells in the XX gonads in absence of Lhx2 was due to ectopic migration of endothelial cells in a cell non-autonomous manner. We also found that, there was increased expression of several endothelial cell-enriched male-biased genes in Lhx2 knockout ovaries. Also, in absence of Lhx2, the migrated endothelial cells formed an angiogenic network similar to that of the wild type testis, although the coelomic blood vessel did not form. Together, our results suggest that Lhx2 in the germ cells is required to suppress vascularization in the developing ovary. These results suggest a need to explore the roles of germ cells in the control of vascularization in developing gonads.

Abstract: Summary
Master transcription factors (TFs) directly regulate present and future cell states by binding DNA regulatory elements and driving gene-expression programs. Their abundance influences epigenetic priming to different cell fates at the chromatin level, especially in the context of differentiation. In order to link TF protein abundance to changes in TF motif accessibility and open chromatin, we developed InTAC-seq, a method for simultaneous quantification of genome-wide chromatin accessibility and intracellular protein abundance in fixed cells. Our method produces high-quality data and is a cost-effective alternative to single-cell techniques. We showcase our method by purifying bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells based on GATA-1 protein levels and establish high GATA-1-expressing BM cells as both epigenetically and functionally similar to erythroid-committed progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Effective control of SARS-CoV-2 infection on primary exposure may reveal correlates of protective immunity to future variants, but we lack insights into immune responses before or at the time virus is first detected. We use blood transcriptomics, multiparameter flow cytometry, and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing spanning the time of incident non-severe infection in unvaccinated virus-naive individuals to identify rapid type 1 interferon (IFN) responses common to other acute respiratory viruses and cell proliferation responses that discriminate SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses. These peak by the time the virus is first detected and sometimes precede virus detection. Cell proliferation is most evident in CD8 T cells and associated with specific expansion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCRs, in contrast to virus-specific antibodies, which lag by 1–2 weeks. Our data support a protective role for early type 1 IFN and CD8 T cell responses, with implications for development of universal T cell vaccines.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb group proteins assemble into multi-protein complexes, known as Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2), that guide cell fate decisions during embryonic development. PRC1 forms an array of biochemically distinct canonical PRC1 (cPRC1) or non-canonical PRC1 (ncPRC1) complexes characterized by the mutually exclusive presence of PCGF (PCGF1-PCGF6) paralog subunit; however, whether each one of these subcomplexes fulfills a distinct role remains largely controversial. Here, by performing a CRISPR-based loss-of-function screen in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we uncovered a previously unappreciated functional redundancy among PRC1 subcomplexes. Disruption of ncPRC1, but not cPRC1, displayed severe defects in ESC pluripotency. Remarkably, coablation of non-canonical and canonical PRC1 in ESCs resulted in exacerbation of the phenotype observed in the non-canonical PRC1-null ESCs, highlighting the importance of functional redundancy among PRC1 subcomplexes. Together, our studies demonstrate that PRC1 subcomplexes act redundantly to silence lineage-specific genes and ensure robust maintenance of ESC identity.

Abstract: Summary
Identification of the tyrosine phosphorylation (pY)-dependent interactome of immune co-receptors is crucial for understanding signal pathways involved in immunotherapy. However, identifying the motif-specific interactome for each pY commonly found on these multi-phosphorylated membrane proteins remains challenging. Here, we describe a photoaffinity-based chemical proteomic approach to dissect the motif-specific cytoplasmic interactomes of the critical immune co-receptor CD28. Various full-length CD28 cytoplasmic tails (CD28cyto) with defined pY and selectively replaced photo-methionine were synthesized and applied to explore three pY-motif-dependent CD28cyto interactomes. We identified a stand-alone interaction of phospholipase PLCG1 with the Y191 motif with enhanced affinity for the sequence neighboring the transmembrane domain. Importantly, taking advantage of native top-down mass spectrometry with a 193-nm laser, we discovered the direct association of a previously undefined pY218 motif with the kinase PKCθ through its C2 domain. This synthetic CD28cyto-based photoaffinity proteomic approach is generically applicable to the study of other immune co-receptors with multiple pY sites on their linear cytoplasmic tail.

Abstract: Summary
Combating fungal pathogens poses metabolic challenges for neutrophils, key innate cells in anti-Candida albicans immunity, yet how host-pathogen interactions cause remodeling of the neutrophil metabolism is unclear. We show that neutrophils mediate renal immunity to disseminated candidiasis by upregulating glucose uptake via selective expression of glucose transporter 1 (Glut1). Mechanistically, dectin-1-mediated recognition of β-glucan leads to activation of PKCδ, which triggers phosphorylation, localization, and early glucose transport by a pool of pre-formed Glut1 in neutrophils. These events are followed by increased Glut1 gene transcription, leading to more sustained Glut1 accumulation, which is also dependent on the β-glucan/dectin-1/CARD9 axis. Card9-deficient neutrophils show diminished glucose incorporation in candidiasis. Neutrophil-specific Glut1-ablated mice exhibit increased mortality in candidiasis caused by compromised neutrophil phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. In human neutrophils, β-glucan triggers metabolic remodeling and enhances candidacidal function. Our data show that the host-pathogen interface increases glycolytic activity in neutrophils by regulating Glut1 expression, localization, and function.

Abstract: The Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) proteins, EZH2 and EZH1 regulate many biological processes by generating the repressive H3K27me3 modifications in the chromatin. However, the factors that regulate the EZH1/EZH2 functions are poorly studied. We identify that the 3′UTRs of EZH2 and EZH1 mRNAs contain the binding sites for the miRNA, miR-150. MicroRNA-150 (miR-150) controls numerous biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation and pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including cancer. We find that miR-150 regulates the levels of EZH1 and EZH2 through various experimental investigations. Since EZH2 is known to form a repressive complex with other epigenetic repressors especially DNMT3A and DNMT3B, we investigated whether miR-150 also regulates the DNMT3A and DNMT3B levels. We report that miR-150 regulates DNMT3A and DNMT3B levels through direct and indirect mechanisms respectively. Since these epigenetic repressors promote cell proliferation, we investigated the effect of miR-150 perturbation on HEK293 cell proliferation. We found that miR-150 inhibits cell proliferation and induces S-phase arrest by increasing the levels of tumor suppressors and decreasing the cell cycle regulators. Collectively, our study shows that miR-150 act as a tumor suppressor by down-regulating the oncogenic major epigenetic repressors and controls cell proliferation.

Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most metastatic, invasive, and fatal tumor type of non-small cell lung cancer that lacks satisfying therapy. The purpose of this work is to investigate the effects of proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 1 (PSMD1) on the progression of LUAD. Specific PSMD1 short hairpin RNA and PSMD1-overpression vectors were used to modify the expression of PSMD1 in LUAD cell lines. A xenograft model of LUAD was established with 5 × 106 stable PSMD1-downregulated A549 cells. The results showed that PSMD1 silence repressed the cell proliferation and induced the cell cycle arrest as well as the apoptosis of A549 and HCC827 cells. While the upregulation of PSMD1 led to the opposite. Furthermore, the results of co-immunoprecipitation revealed that PSMD1 interacted with PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1). And PSMD1 inhibited the ubiquitination and enhanced the stability of PINK1 protein. Subsequently, we found that PSMD1 promoted the viability and repressed the apoptosis of LUAD cells by stabilizing PINK1. PSMD1 knockdown suppressed the malignant phenotypes of LUAD in ex vivo experiments, as well as the in vivo growth of LUAD tumor by the degradation of PINK1. In summary, PSMD1 facilitated the progression of LUAD by the regulation of PINK1.

Abstract: Summary
The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides essential cues to promote endothelial specification during tissue development in vivo; correspondingly, ECM is considered essential for endothelial differentiation outside of the body. However, systematic studies to assess the precise contribution of individual ECM proteins to endothelial differentiation have not been conducted. Further, the multi-component nature of differentiation protocols makes it challenging to study the underlying mechanisms by which the ECM contributes to cell fate. In this study, we determined that Laminin 411 alone increases endothelial differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells over collagen I or Matrigel. The effect of ECM was shown to be independent of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding capacity. We also show that ECM-guided endothelial differentiation is dependent on activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), integrin-linked kinase (ILK), Notch, and β-catenin pathways. Our results indicate that ECM contributes to endothelial differentiation through multiple avenues, which converge at the expression of active β-catenin.

Abstract: Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that can cause severe disease, but there are no approved treatments or vaccines. A complication for flavivirus vaccine development is the potential of immunogens to enhance infection via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a process mediated by poorly neutralizing and cross-reactive antibodies. Thus, there is a great need to develop immunogens that minimize the potential to elicit enhancing antibodies. Here we utilized structure-based protein engineering to develop “resurfaced” (rs) ZIKV immunogens based on E glycoprotein domain III (ZDIIIs), in which epitopes bound by variably neutralizing antibodies were masked by combinatorial mutagenesis. We identified one resurfaced ZDIII immunogen (rsZDIII-2.39) that elicited a protective but immune-focused response. Compared to wild type ZDIII, immunization with resurfaced rsZDIII-2.39 protein nanoparticles produced fewer numbers of ZIKV EDIII antigen-reactive B cells and elicited serum that had a lower magnitude of induced ADE against dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV1) Our findings enhance our understanding of the structural and functional determinants of antibody protection against ZIKV.

Abstract: In adult testis, the cell mobility is essential for spermatogonia differentiation and is suspected to regulate spermatogonial stem cell fate. Netrin-1 controls cell migration and/or survival according to the cellular context. Its involvement in some self-renewing lineages raises the possibility that Netrin-1 could have a role in spermatogenesis. We show that in addition to Sertoli cells, a fraction of murine undifferentiated spermatogonia express the Netrin-1 receptor UNC5c and that UNC5c contributes to spermatogonia differentiation. Receptor loss in Unc5crcm males leads to the concomitant accumulation of transit-amplifying progenitors and short syncytia of spermatogonia. Without altering cell death rates, the consequences of Unc5c loss worsen with age: the increase in quiescent undifferentiated progenitors associated with a higher spermatogonial stem cell enriched subset leads to the spermatocyte I decline. We demonstrate in vitro that Netrin-1 promotes a guidance effect as it repulses both undifferentiated and differentiating spermatogonia. Finally, we propose that UNC5c triggers undifferentiated spermatogonia adhesion/ migration and that the repulsive activity of Netrin-1 receptors could regulate spermatogonia differentiation, and maintain germ cell homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The gastric hormone ghrelin stimulates food intake and increases plasma glucose through activation of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) has been proposed to inhibit actions of ghrelin through inverse effects on GHSR activity. Here, we investigate the effects of exogenous LEAP2 on postprandial glucose metabolism and ad libitum food intake in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 20 healthy men. We report that LEAP2 infusion lowers postprandial plasma glucose and growth hormone concentrations and decreases food intake during an ad libitum meal test. In wild-type mice, plasma glucose and food intake are reduced by LEAP2 dosing, but not in GHSR-null mice, pointing to GHSR as a potential mediator of LEAP2’s glucoregulatory and appetite-suppressing effects in mice.

Abstract: Dietary phytochemicals are currently being studied with great interest due to their ability to regulate the epigenome resulting in prevention of cancer. Some natural botanicals have been reported to have enhanced and synergistic impact on cancer suppression when administered at optimum concentrations and in-conjunction. Sulforaphane (SFN) is an isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables and sodium butyrate (NaB) is a short-chain fatty acid produced by gut microbiota. They have been intensively explored due to numerous anti-cancerous properties and ability to modulate epigenetic machinery by inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC). Genistein (GE), present in soy, is a known DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor. While combined chemoprotective epigenetic effects induced by SFN and GE have been investigated, the key impact of combinatorial SFN-NaB, GE-NaB, and SFN-GE-NaB bioactive components in regulation of various mechanisms are poorly defined. In the present study, we found that combinations of dietary compounds had synergistic effects in decreasing cellular viability at lower dosages than their single dosages in breast cancer cell lines. The respective combinations limited growth and increased apoptosis and necrosis in cancerous cells among which the tri-combination displayed the most significant impact. Additionally, the respective combinations of compounds arrested MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells at G2/M phase. Our further mechanistic evaluation revealed that respective di-combinations and tri-combination had higher impact in down-regulation of DNMTs (DNMT3A and DNMT3B), HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC6 and HDAC11), histone methyltransferases (EZH2 and SUV39H1) and histone acetyltransferases (GCN5, PCAF, P300 and CBP) levels as compared to singly administered compounds. We also found that these combinations exhibited global epigenetic changes by inhibition of DNMT and HDAC activity, histone H3 at lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me) and histone H3 at lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me) levels, and by induction of histone acetyltransferases activity. Collectively, our investigation indicates that combined SFN, GE and NaB is highly effective in inhibiting breast cancer genesis by, at least in part, regulating epigenetic modifications, which may have implications in breast cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Cell replacement therapy using β cells derived from stem cells is a promising alternative to conventional diabetes treatment options. Although current differentiation methods produce glucose-responsive β cells, they can also yield populations of undesired endocrine progenitors and other proliferating cell types that might interfere with long-term islet function and safety of transplanted cells. Here, we describe the generation of an array of monoclonal antibodies against cell surface markers that selectively label stem cell-derived islet cells. A high-throughput screen identified promising candidates, including three clones that mark a high proportion of endocrine cells in differentiated cultures. A scalable magnetic sorting method was developed to enrich for human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived islet cells using these three antibodies, leading to the formation of islet-like clusters with improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and reduced growth upon transplantation. This strategy should facilitate large-scale production of functional islet clusters from stem cells for disease modeling and cell replacement therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Culture of limbal epithelial cells (LECs) provides the principal source of transplanted limbal stem cells (LESCs) for treatment of limbal-stem-cell deficiency. Optimization of the culture conditions for in-vitro-expanded LECs will help to create a graft with an optimized quality and quantity of LESCs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of WNT16B on LECs and corneal wound healing and the underlying mechanism. Treatment with exogenous WNT16B increased the proliferative capacity and self-renewal of LECs in the cultures. We further revealed that C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) was vital for the effects of WNT16B, and activation of CXCR4/MEK/ERK signaling was pivotal in mediating the effects of WNT16B on LECs enriched for LESCs. The stimulatory effect of WNT16B on corneal epithelial repair was confirmed in a mouse corneal-wound-healing model. In summary, WNT16B enhances proliferation and self-renewal of LECs via the CXCR4/MEK/ERK signaling cascade and accelerates corneal-epithelial wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
The spatial arrangement of newly synthesized transcriptome in eukaryotic cells underlies various biological processes including cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, we combine metabolic incorporation of electron-rich ribonucleosides (e.g., 6-thioguanosine and 4-thiouridine) with a peroxidase-mediated proximity-dependent RNA labeling technique (APEX-seq) to develop a sensitive method, termed MERR APEX-seq, for selectively profiling newly transcribed RNAs at specific subcellular locations in live cells. We demonstrate that MERR APEX-seq is 20-fold more efficient than APEX-seq and offers both high spatial specificity and high coverage in mitochondrial matrix. At the ER membrane, 91% of the transcripts captured by MERR APEX-seq encode for secretory pathway proteins, thus demonstrating the high spatial specificity of MERR APEX-seq in open subcellular compartments. Application of MERR APEX-seq to the nuclear lamina of human cells reveals a local transcriptome of 1,012 RNAs, many of which encode for nuclear proteins involved in histone modification, chromosomal structure maintenance, and RNA processing.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and vulnerability evolve in metastatic cancers as tumor cells and extrinsic microenvironmental influences change during treatment. To support the development of methods for identifying these mechanisms in individual people, here we present an omic and multidimensional spatial (OMS) atlas generated from four serial biopsies of an individual with metastatic breast cancer during 3.5 years of therapy. This resource links detailed, longitudinal clinical metadata that includes treatment times and doses, anatomic imaging, and blood-based response measurements to clinical and exploratory analyses, which includes comprehensive DNA, RNA, and protein profiles; images of multiplexed immunostaining; and 2- and 3-dimensional scanning electron micrographs. These data report aspects of heterogeneity and evolution of the cancer genome, signaling pathways, immune microenvironment, cellular composition and organization, and ultrastructure. We present illustrative examples of how integrative analyses of these data reveal potential mechanisms of response and resistance and suggest novel therapeutic vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Summary
A rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor was constructed for growing massive functional cardiac constructs to recover the function of a distressed rat heart. Three-dimensional cardiac tissues were engineered by seeding human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) fiber sheets (3D-hiPSC-CTs) and cultured in the RWV bioreactor (RWV group) or under static conditions (control group). The tissues were transplanted into a myocardial infarction nude rat model, and cardiac performance was evaluated. In the RWV group, cell viability and contractile and electrical properties significantly improved, mature cardiomyocytes were observed, and mechanical stress-related mediators of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling were upregulated compared with those of the control. Four weeks post-transplantation, tissue survival and left ventricular ejection fraction significantly improved in the RWV group. Hence, dynamic culture in an RWV bioreactor could provide a superior culture environment for improved performance of 3D-hiPSC-CTs, providing a means for functional cardiomyogenesis in myocyte-loss heart failure.

Abstract: Summary
Skin tissue regeneration after injury involves the production and integration of signals by stem cells residing in hair follicles (HFSCs). Much remains unknown about how specific wound-derived factors modulate stem cell contribution to hair growth. We demonstrate that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is produced in response to skin injury and during the anagen phase of the hair cycle. Intradermal injection of TSLP promoted wound-induced hair growth (WIHG), whereas neutralizing TSLP receptor (TSLPR) inhibited WIHG. Using flow cytometry and fluorescent immunostaining, we found that TSLP promoted proliferation of transit-amplifying cells. Lgr5CreER-mediated deletion of Tslpr in HFSCs inhibited both wound-induced and exogenous TSLP-induced hair growth. Our data highlight a novel function for TSLP in regulation of hair follicle activity during homeostasis and wound healing.

Abstract: Summary
Predictable and sustainable engraftment of live biotherapeutic products into the human gut microbiome is being explored as a promising way to modulate the human gut microbiome. We utilize a synbiotic approach pairing the infant gut microbe Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis (B. infantis) and human milk oligosaccharides (HMO). B. infantis, which is typically absent in adults, engrafts into healthy adult microbiomes in an HMO-dependent manner at a relative abundance of up to 25% of the bacterial population without antibiotic pretreatment or adverse effects. Corresponding changes in metabolites are detected. Germ-free mice transplanted with dysbiotic human microbiomes also successfully engraft with B. infantis in an HMO-dependent manner, and the synbiotic augments butyrate levels both in this in vivo model and in in vitro cocultures of the synbiotic with specific Firmicutes species. Finally, the synbiotic inhibits the growth of enteropathogens in vitro. Our findings point to a potential safe mechanism for ameliorating dysbioses characteristic of numerous human diseases.

Abstract: Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) from umbilical cord blood (UCB) are used for transplantation to treat blood disorders. Methods to estimate the HSPC count in umbilical cord blood, and thereby identify high-value blood units, are time-consuming and costly. Recent studies indicate that the UCB plasma protein composition relates to the HSPC count. We compared the plasma proteome of UCB with high vs low HSPC cell count (>115 × 106 vs < 51 × 106 CD34+ cells l−1) by using a combination of global untargeted MS quantitative proteomics and targeted proximity extension assay (PEA) proteomics. For the MS platform, 96 proteins differed significantly between the CD34+ groups, and out of these, 44 proteins showed more than a two-fold difference. Seven pathways were enriched in high CD34+ samples, including pathways relating to platelets, coagulation, and lipid transport. For the PEA platform, 61 proteins were differentially abundant, and among these 7 proteins showed more than a two-fold difference between groups. In the PEA data, a high CD34+ cell count was associated with a protein hub with functions in platelet degranulation. We conclude that the HSPC count is related to the UCB plasma proteome, but that further studies are needed to discern if these findings reflect causal relationships.

Abstract: Tissue engineering technology will be the main approach to tissue regeneration in the future and are promising for the treatment of large-area burns and refractory wounds. Dedifferentiated fat cells (DFAT) derived from mature adipocytes (MAs) as a seed cell have great potential in cell therapy and tissue engineering for the treatment of a variety of clinical diseases because of their wider availability, stronger proliferation ability, multidirectional redifferentiation potential, higher cell purity, lower heterogeneity, and greater biosafety profile. However, the triggering mechanism for MAs reprogramming in vitro is unclear. In this study, MAs were successfully induced to dedifferentiate into DFAT in a short time in vitro using an “improved ceiling culture method". Flow cytometry, adipogenic, and osteogenic differentiation experiments verified that DFAT cells present the biological characteristics of stem cells. In addition, changing the stiffness of the extracellular matrix can inhibit the dedifferentiation of MAs to DFAT, and increase the expression of Yes-associated protein/transcriptional co-activator with the PDZ-binding motif (YAP/TAZ), nuclear translocation, and the expression of reprogramming transcription factors. In conclusion, extracellular matrix stiffness can induce MAs to dedifferentiate into DFAT in vitro, and can directly transmit mechanical force signals to the nucleus via YAP/TAZ binding to trigger the expression of stem cell-related reprogramming factors.
