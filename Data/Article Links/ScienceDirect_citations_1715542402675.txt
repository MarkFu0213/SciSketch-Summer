Abstract: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is associated with altered metabolic patterns, leading to increased lactate production even in the presence of sufficient oxygen supply. Studies have shown hyperglycemia to be an important factor in determining development of DKD. Here we explore the metabolic consequences of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibition exerted by the LDH inhibitor, oxamate, in the isolated rat renal proximal tubular cells (NRK-52E) under hyperglycemic conditions. Cells treated with oxamate (100 mM) for 24 h, with or without high D-glucose (25 mM) load, were investigated with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate in a 1T NMR system. Respiratory measurements using an oxygen microsensor system was conducted. Oxamate treatment of cells with or without the presences of high D-glucose, reduced the lactate production/accumulation with 36.5% or 22.5% respectively. Reduced proliferation, hypertrophic effects, as well as elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the NRK-52E cells were found. The increased glycolytic flux in high D-glucose cultured NRK-52E cells resulted in an upregulation of the cellular oxygen consumption rate upon treatment with oxamate. Our findings suggested that in vitro cultured NRK-52E cells exposed to hyperglycemic conditions, could redirect the glycolytic flux towards oxidative phosphorylation by LDH inhibition. This link between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism may be determined by the redox balance (NAD+/NADH ratio). In conclusion, hyperglycemic conditions and oxamate treatment alters the metabolic phenotype of NRK-52E cells towards increased oxygen utilization mediated by a decreased NAD+/NADH ratio, which in turn decreases cell proliferation/survival.

Abstract: The immune-mediated tissue destruction of graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) remains a major barrier to greater use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have intrinsic immunosuppressive qualities and are being actively investigated as a therapeutic strategy for treating GvHD. We characterized Cymerus™ MSCs, which are derived from adult, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and show they display surface markers and tri-lineage differentiation consistent with MSCs isolated from bone marrow (BM). Administering iPSC-MSCs altered phosphorylation and cellular localization of the T cell-specific kinase, Protein Kinase C theta (PKCθ), attenuated disease severity, and prolonged survival in a humanized mouse model of GvHD. Finally, we evaluated a constellation of pro-inflammatory molecules on circulating PBMCs that correlated closely with disease progression and which may serve as biomarkers to monitor therapeutic response. Altogether, our data suggest Cymerus iPSC-MSCs offer the potential for an off-the-shelf, cell-based therapy to treat GvHD.

Abstract: Olfactory ensheathing glia (OEG) play an important role in regulating the regeneration of an injured nervous system. However, chronic inflammation damage reduces the viability of OEG via poorly understood mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the pathological responses of OEG in response to LPS-mediated inflammation stress in vitro. The results indicated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment significantly reduced the viability of OEG in a dose-dependent fashion. Mechanistically, LPS stimuli induced mitochondrial oxidative damage, mitochondrial fragmentation, mitochondrial metabolism disruption, and mitochondrial apoptosis activation. Furthermore, we verified that LPS modulated mitochondrial apoptosis by promoting Bax upregulation, and this process was regulated by the JNK-Bnip3 pathway. Inhibition of the JNK-Bnip3 pathway prevented LPS-mediated Bax activation, thus attenuating OEG apoptosis. Altogether, our data illustrated that LPS-mediated inflammation injury evoked mitochondrial abnormalities in OEG damage via the JNK-Bnip3-Bax pathway. This finding provides a potential target to protect OEG against chronic inflammation stress.

Abstract: Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common hematologic malignancy with variable degrees of immunodeficiency. Disease- and treatment-related compromise of the immune system predisposes patients to infections, which are a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
Objective
We aimed to establish the incidence and main characteristics of infections in MM patients treated at our center over a 10-year period.
Method and results
Of the 412 patients retrospectively analyzed, 154 (37.4%) were documented to have at least one episode of infection and were included in this study. A total of 244 infectious episodes were documented. The most common site of infection was the lung, followed by the genitourinary system. The most common infections were bacterial, followed by viral. Escherichia coli were the most common organism. In 160 (65.5%) episodes, the organism was not isolated. Thalidomide with dexamethasone was the most common treatment regimen, followed by melphalan with dexamethasone. Infection was the main cause of death in 26 (6.3%) out of all 412 patients.
Conclusion
Infections are a notable cause of morbidity and mortality in the clinical course of MM patients. By considering patient and disease characteristics, a risk-adapted selection of the MM treatment should be employed, with special attention toward patient age and disease-associated organ dysfunction. Patient education, access to healthcare and physician vigilance are also essential. Vaccination and antimicrobial prophylaxis may be considered prior to or during therapy.

Abstract: Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is the only human neurotrophic factor with an evolutionarily-conserved C. elegans homolog, Y54G2A.23 or manf-1. MANF is a small, soluble, endoplasmic-reticulum (ER)-resident protein that is secreted upon ER stress and promotes survival of target cells such as neurons. However, the role of MANF in ER stress and its mechanism of cellular protection are not clear and the function of MANF in C. elegans is only beginning to emerge. In this study, we show that depletion of C. elegans manf-1 causes a slight decrease in lifespan and brood size; furthermore, combined depletion of manf-1 and the IRE-1/XBP-1 ER stress/UPR pathway resulted in sterile animals that did not produce viable progeny. We demonstrate upregulation of markers of ER stress in L1 larval nematodes, as measured by hsp-3 and hsp-4 transcription, upon depletion of manf-1 by RNAi or mutation; however, there was no difference in tunicamycin-induced expression of hsp-3 and hsp-4 between wild-type and MANF-deficient worms. Surprisingly, larval growth arrest observed in wild-type nematodes reared on tunicamycin is completely prevented in the manf-1 (tm3603) mutant. Transcriptional microarray analysis revealed that manf-1 mutant L1 larvae exhibit a novel modulation of innate immunity genes in response to tunicamycin. The hypothesis that manf-1 negatively regulates the innate immunity pathway is supported by our finding that the development of manf-1 mutant larvae compared to wild-type larvae is not inhibited by growth on P. aeruginosa. Together, our data represent the first characterization of C. elegans MANF as a key modulator of organismal ER stress and immunity.

Abstract: The crustacean, Artemia franciscana, displays a complex life history in which embryos either arrest development and undertake diapause as cysts or they develop into swimming nauplii. Diapause entry is preceded during embryogenesis by the synthesis of specific molecular chaperones, namely the small heat shock proteins p26, ArHsp21, and ArHsp22, and the ferritin homolog, artemin. Maximal synthesis of diapause-specific molecular chaperones is dependent on the transcription factor, heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1), found in similar amounts in cysts and nauplii newly released from females. This investigation was performed to determine why, if cysts and nauplii contain comparable amounts of Hsf1, only cyst-destined embryos synthesize diapause-specific molecular chaperones. Quantification by qPCR and immunoprobing of Western blots, respectively, demonstrated that hsf1 mRNA and Hsf1 peaked by day 2 post-fertilization in embryos that were developing into cysts and then declined. hsf1 mRNA and Hsf1 were present in nauplii-destined embryos on day 2 post-fertilization, but in much smaller amounts than in cyst-destined embryos, and they increased in quantity until release of nauplii from females. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that the amount of Hsf1 in nuclei was greatest on day 4 post-fertilization in cyst-destined embryos but could not be detected in nuclei of nauplius-destined embryos at this time. The differences in quantity and location of Hsf1 explain why embryos fated to become cysts and eventually enter diapause synthesize p26, ArHsp21, ArHsp22, and artemin, whereas nauplius-destined embryos do not produce these molecular chaperones.

Abstract: Summary
Src kinase plays an important role in a multitude of fundamental cellular processes and is often found deregulated in tumors. Active Src adopts an open conformation, whereas inactive Src is characterized by a very compact structure stabilized by inhibitory intramolecular interactions. Taking advantage of this spatial regulation, we constructed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Src biosensor and analyzed conformational changes of Src following Src activation and the spatiotemporal dynamics of Src activity in cells. We found that activatory mutations either in regulatory or kinase domains induce opening of the Src structure. Surprisingly, we discovered that Src inhibitors differ in their effect on the Src structure, some counterintuitively inducing an open conformation. Finally, we analyzed the dynamics of Src activity in focal adhesions by FRET imaging and found that Src is rapidly activated during focal adhesion assembly, and its activity remains steady and high throughout the life cycle of focal adhesion and decreases during focal adhesion disassembly.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most frequently encountered cardiac arrhythmia in the clinical setting and the foremost cause of stroke, results from a progressive decrease in atrial refractoriness. In addition, defective calcium signaling has been shown to play a central role in AF pathogenesis. Recently it was shown that the miR-106b-25 cluster is suppressed in patients with AF, which increased ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) expression. Expression of the miR-106b-25 cluster and RyR2 protein were determined in our institutional series of patients with AF. Hemodynamic properties, RyR2 binding, suppression of ATP2A2 (encoding ATPase sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + transporting 2) were also determined. We found that all patients had elevated RyR2 protein expression; however, a cohort of patients with AF had high miR-93, miR-106b, and miR-25 expression. There was no difference in hemodynamic properties, RyR2 binding, or suppression of ATP2A2 in either cohort of patients with AF when compared to patients with normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Immunoblot assay showed hyperactive Akt, S6K, and S6 kinases in patients with AF as compared to patients with NSR. Protein kinase C activation, as measured by PKC phosphorylation, was also hyperactive in patients with AF. Cumulatively, our findings show that RyR2 expression is regulated by multiple mechanisms including the miR-106b-25, and that PKC activation might provide novel clues to increased intracellular calcium levels during AF pathogenesis.

Abstract: CRN2 is an actin filament binding protein involved in the regulation of various cellular processes including cell migration and invasion. CRN2 has been implicated in the malignant progression of different types of human cancer. We used CRN2 knock-out mice for analyses as well as for crossbreeding with a Tp53/Pten knock-out glioblastoma mouse model. CRN2 knock-out mice were subjected to a phenotyping screen at the German Mouse Clinic. Murine glioblastoma tissue specimens as well as cultured murine brain slices and glioblastoma cell lines were investigated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and cell biological experiments. Protein interactions were studied by immunoprecipitation, pull-down, and enzyme activity assays. CRN2 knock-out mice displayed neurological and behavioural alterations, e.g. reduced hearing sensitivity, reduced acoustic startle response, hypoactivity, and less frequent urination. While glioblastoma mice with or without the additional CRN2 knock-out allele exhibited no significant difference in their survival rates, the increased levels of CRN2 in transplanted glioblastoma cells caused a higher tumour cell encasement of murine brain slice capillaries. We identified two important factors of the tumour microenvironment, the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 4 (TIMP4) and the matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14, synonym: MT1-MMP), as novel binding partners of CRN2. All three proteins mutually interacted and co-localised at the front of lamellipodia, and CRN2 was newly detected in exosomes. On the functional level, we demonstrate that CRN2 increased the secretion of TIMP4 as well as the catalytic activity of MMP14. Our results imply that CRN2 represents a pro-invasive effector within the tumour cell microenvironment of glioblastoma multiforme.

Abstract: We assessed clinical presentations and the rate of central nervous system (CNS) bleeding in neonates with FXIIID who exhibited bleeding diathesis in the early days of their lives. A total of 27 neonates presented bleeding or abnormal clinical symptoms, diagnosed with FXIII deficiency were evaluated. Factor XIII concentrate was initiated as the first-line of treatment, and prophylactic therapy was given to all patients. Umbilical cord bleeding, delayed detachment of umbilical stunt, seizure, hematoma, and ecchymosis were concurrent complications in 27 (100%), 5 (18.5%), 5 (18.5%), 3 (11.1%), and 1 (3.7%) of the patients, respectively. History of having CNS bleeding was detected in 13 (48.1%) patients. There was no significant association between CNS bleeding and gender, familial history of FXIIID, or other clinical presentations. Also, there was no significant difference in the mean age of the patients who had CNS bleeding (3.4 ± 0.9 days) and without CNS bleeding (2.9 ± 0.7 days). However, a near significant threshold difference between the patients with and without CNS bleeding was found regarding the mean number of suspicious FXIIID death in their family (1.8 ± 0.5 and 0.7 ± 0.1, respectively, P = 0.05). Therefore, a suggested diagnostic algorithm based on prenatal diagnosis could be useful for timely detection of FXIII deficiency in neonates.

Abstract: Summary
5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) initiates the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes from arachidonic acid, which requires the nuclear membrane-bound 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP) for substrate transfer. Here, we identified human 5-LO as a molecular target of melleolides from honey mushroom (Armillaria mellea). Melleolides inhibit 5-LO via an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde serving as Michael acceptor for surface cysteines at the substrate entrance that are revealed as molecular determinants for 5-LO activity. Experiments with 5-LO mutants, where select cysteines had been replaced by serine, indicated that the investigated melleolides suppress 5-LO product formation via two distinct modes of action: (1) by direct interference with 5-LO activity involving two or more of the cysteines 159, 300, 416, and 418, and (2) by preventing 5-LO/FLAP assemblies involving selectively Cys159 in 5-LO. Interestingly, replacement of Cys159 by serine prevented 5-LO/FLAP assemblies as well, implying Cys159 as determinant for 5-LO/FLAP complex formation at the nuclear membrane required for leukotriene biosynthesis.

Abstract: Hyperglycemia induces retinal pigmented epithelial cell apoptosis and mitochondrial stress via poorly understood mechanisms. The goal of our current study is to explore whether mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (Mst1) is involved in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia-mediated retinal pigmented epithelial cell apoptosis by triggering mitochondrial abnormalities and activating the Smad2 signaling pathway. Retinal pigmented epithelial ARPE-19 cells were presented with a high-glucose challenge in vitro. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured via western blotting, ELISAs, and immunofluorescence assays. Mitochondrial function was detected via JC-1 staining, mitochondrial ROS flow cytometry, western blotting, and ELISAs. Loss- and gain-of-function assays were performed via cell transfection and transduction with Mst1 siRNA and Smad2 adenovirus, respectively. The results indicated that hyperglycemia treatment upregulated the levels of Mst1, an effect that was accompanied by an increase in ARPE-19 cell apoptosis. Loss of Mst1 attenuated hyperglycemia-induced cell apoptosis, and this effect seemed to be associated with mitochondrial protection. In response to hyperglycemia stimulus, mitochondrial stress was noted in ARPE-19 cells, including mitochondrial ROS overproduction, mitochondrial respiratory metabolism dysfunction, mitochondrial fission/fusion imbalance, and mitochondrial apoptosis activation. Further, we provided evidence to support the crucial role played by Smad2 in promoting Mst1-mediated cell apoptosis and mitochondrial stress. Overexpression of Smad2 abrogated the beneficial effects of Mst1 deletion on ARPE-19 cell viability and mitochondrial protection. Altogether, our results identified Mst1 as a novel mediator controlling the fate of retinal pigmented epithelial cells and mitochondrial homeostasis via the Smad2 signaling pathway. Based on this finding, strategies to repress Mst1 upregulation and block Smad2 activation are vital to alleviate hyperglycemia-mediated retinal pigmented epithelial cell damage.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) tumor cells exhibit drug resistance and are highly infiltrative. GBM stem cells (GSCs), which have low proliferative capacity are thought to be one of the sources of resistant cells which result in relapse/recurrence. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating quiescent-specific tumor cell biology are not well understood. Using human GBM cell lines and patient-derived GBM cells, Oregon Green dye retention was used to identify and isolate the slow-cycling, quiescent-like cell subpopulation from the more proliferative cells in culture. Sensitivity of cell subpopulations to temozolomide and radiation, as well as the migration and invasive potential were measured. Differential expression analysis following RNAseq identified genes enriched in the quiescent cell subpopulation. Orthotopic transplantation of cells into mice was used to compare the in vivo malignancy and invasive capacity of the cells. Proliferative quiescence correlated with better TMZ resistance and enhanced cell invasion, in vitro and in vivo. RNAseq expression analysis identified genes involved in the regulation cell invasion/migration and a three-gene signature, TGFBI, IGFBP3, CHI3L1, overexpressed in quiescent cells which correlates with poor GBM patient survival.

Abstract: Introduction
Although there is a vast literature regarding the association between inherited thrombophilia, obstetric complications and the effect of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), these are controversial and we have not found publications related to additional risk factors other than thrombophilia. Our objectives were to assess the prevalence of miscarriage, placenta-mediated pregnancy complications and fetal loss in pregnant women with IT, establishing associated risk factors and the effect of LMWH.
Materials and methods
A retrospective cohort of pregnant women with IT was formed. Risk factors considered were: high-risk IT, age ≥35 years, body mass index ≥25 and ≥30, assisted reproductive technology, antiphospholipid antibodies, autoimmune disease, first-degree family history of obstetric complications and personal history of venous or arterial thromboembolic disease, the outcomes being M, FL and PMPC.
Results and conclusions
Data from 250 pregnancies in 88 women were obtained. There were 112 (45%) Ms, 13 (5.2%) FLs and 25 (10%) PMPCs. High-risk IT was associated with FL (OR=4.96; 95% CI, 1.42–17.3). Antiphospholipid antibodies and family history of obstetric complications were associated with PMPC (OR=7.12; 95% CI, 1.89–26.74, OR=3.88; 95% CI, 1.18–12.78, respectively). The LMWH presented a benefit in the combined outcome (any obstetric complication, OR=0.25; 95% CI, 0.12–0.54) and M (OR=0.41; 95% CI, 0.20–0.82). We conclude that obstetric complications are common in women with IT. Antiphospholipid antibodies, family history of obstetric complications and high-risk IT might be additional risk factors. The LMWH has an apparent protective effect against obstetric complications, which is consistent with some previous studies.

Abstract: Vang-like 2 (VANGL2) is a four-pass transmembrane protein required for a variety of polarized cell behaviors underlying embryonic development. Recent data show human VANGL2 interacts with integrin αv to control cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. The goal of this study was to further define the functional relationship between integrin αv and VANGL2. We demonstrate integrin αv regulates VANGL2 protein levels both in vitro and in the zebrafish embryo. While integrin αv knockdown reduces VANGL2 expression at membrane compartments, it does not affect VANGL2 transcription. Knockdown of integrin β5, but not β1 or β3, also decreases VANGL2 protein levels. Inhibition of protein translation using cycloheximide demonstrates that integrin αv knockdown cells have increased VANGL2 degradation while interference with either proteasome or lysosome function restores VANGL2. We further show integrin activation and stimulation of cell-matrix adhesion using MnCl2 fails to influence VANGL2. However, MnCl2 treatment stabilizes VANGL2 protein expression levels in the presence of cycloheximide. In the converse experiment, blockage of integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion using a cyclic RGD peptide causes a reduction in VANGL2 protein levels. Together, our findings support a model where integrin αv and cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix are required to maintain VANGL2 protein levels and thus function at the plasma membrane.

Abstract: Autophagy plays an important role in maintaining cell function. Abnormal autophagy leads to cell dysfunction and is associated with many diseases such as tumors, immunodeficiency diseases, lysosomal storage disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is precisely regulated, and PTEN plays an important role in regulating autophagy. As noncoding small RNAs, miRNAs play an important role in the fine regulation of cellular processes. However, the mechanism of the miRNA regulation of PTEN-related autophagy has not been fully elucidated. In this study, our results showed that miR-4465 significantly inhibited the expression of PTEN, upregulated phosphorylated AKT, and thereby inhibited autophagy by activating mTOR in HEK293, HeLa, and SH-SY5Y cells. Further studies indicated that miR-4465 reduced PTEN mRNA levels through posttranscriptional regulation via directly targeting the 3′-UTR. Our novel findings provide useful hints for the comprehensive elucidation of the molecular mechanism of miRNA-regulated PTEN-related autophagy and may also provide some new insights for the exploration of miRNAs in the treatment of PTEN-related diseases.

Abstract: Metabolic surgery ameliorates insulin resistance and is associated with long-term, effective weight loss, but the mechanisms involved remain unknown. Here, the duodenal-jejunal omega switch (DJOS) surgery in combination with high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet was performed on diet obese rats and joint effects of bariatric surgery and different dietary patterns on heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP90 plasma and liver concentrations were measured. We found that plasma and liver levels of HSP70 were lower after DJOS surgery in comparison to the control in the groups of animals kept on control diet (CD) and high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFS) but the postoperative change of the diet led to the increase in HSP70 in plasma and liver concentration in DJOS-operated animals. A high-calorie meal, rich in carbohydrates and fats, significantly increased circulating levels of HSP90, reducing the normalising effect of DJOS. The HFS diet applied during all stages of the experiment led to the higher levels of liver HSP90 concentration. The combination of CD and DJOS surgery was the most efficient in the lowering of the HSP90 liver concentration. The normalisation of circulating levels and liver concentrations of HSP70 and HSP90 may be achieved in a combination of DJOS procedure with a proper dietary plan.

Abstract: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are found in all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) and play a critical role in protecting organisms from a range of environmental stresses. However, little is known about their physiological functions in red algae. Therefore, we characterized the sHSPs (PysHSPs) in the red macroalga Pyropia yezoensis, which inhabits the upper intertidal zone where it experiences fluctuating stressful environmental conditions on a daily and seasonal basis, and examined their expression profiles at different developmental stages and under varying environmental conditions. We identified five PysHSPs (PysHSP18.8, 19.1, 19.2, 19.5, and 25.8). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that expression of the genes PysHSP18.8, PysHSP19.5, and PysHSP25.8 was repressed at all the developmental stages under normal conditions, whereas PysHSP19.1 and PysHSP19.2 were overexpressed in mature gametophytes and sporophytes. Exposure of the gametophytes to high temperature, oxidative stress, or copper significantly increased the mRNA transcript levels of all the five genes, while exogenous application of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocylopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) significantly increased the expression levels of PysHSP19.2, PysHSP19.5, and PysHSP25.8. These findings will help to further our understanding of the role of PysHSP genes and provide clues about how Pyropia species can adapt to the stressful conditions encountered in the upper intertidal zone during their life cycle.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Mutation in miRNAs results in various pathological conditions such as inflammation, viral infections, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity. We have evaluated the association of miR-423 rs6505162C>A and rs8067576 A>T among patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and controls from North China. Our study found that one SNP rs6505162C>A in miR-423 coding region was associated with the increase risk of humanunexplained RPL (URPL), but no differences were found in another SNP rs8067576 A>T. However, in two-locus haplotype analysis, miR-423-CC/TT haplotype was associated with an increased risk of URPL. The level of mature miR-423 was obviously down-regulated in cells transfected with miR-423-CC/TT haplotype. miR-423-CC/TT haplotype inhibited HTR-8/SVneo cells proliferation and migration and promoted cells apoptosis. Further experiments identified that mesoderm development candidate 1 (MESDC1) was a functionally relevant target of miR-423, and its expression was reversely regulated by miR-423. More importantly, dual-luciferase assay indicated miR-423-CC/TT haplotype decreasing miR-423 expression, could up-regulate MESDC1 expression. Collectively, our data suggest that miR-423-CC/TT haplotype in pre-miR-423 may aggravate the risk of developing URPL by influencing the level of mature miR-423 and its target gene MESDC1.

Abstract: Introduction and objective
In this study, we evaluated the influence of the transcript type on hematological and clinical parameters, as well as the event-free survival of 50 patients in the Chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase.
Methods
We reviewed the medical records of 55 patients with Chronic myeloid leukemia. The eligibility criteria were based on the availability of hematological and clinical baseline data in the medical records. Data on BCR-ABL transcripts were obtained from medical records.
Results
Eighteen patients (36%) had the b2a2 transcript, 24 (48%) had b3a2 and 8 (16%) had b2a2/b3a2. The median platelet count for transcripts b2a2, b3a2 and b2a2/b3a2 was 320.65×103/L, 396×103/L, and 327.05×103/L, respectively (p=0.896). We could not find any differences in relation to the other hematological parameters, when compared to the transcript type. Comparison between spleen and liver size and type of transcript did not differ inside the groups (p=0.395 and p=0.647, respectively) and the association between risk scores and transcript type did not show statistical significance (p>0.05). The 21-month probability for event-free survival was 21%, 48% and 66% for the transcripts b2a2, b3a2 and b2a2/b3a2 respectively (p=0.226)
Conclusion
We conclude that the expression BCR-ABL transcripts have no influence on hematological, clinical and event-free survival parameters of patients in the Chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase.

Abstract: Summary
HIV-1 primarily infects T lymphocytes and uses these motile cells as migratory vehicles for effective dissemination in the host. Paradoxically, the virus at the same time disrupts multiple cellular processes underlying lymphocyte motility, seemingly counterproductive to rapid systemic infection. Here we show by intravital microscopy in humanized mice that perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton via the lentiviral protein Nef, and not changes to chemokine receptor expression or function, is the dominant cause of dysregulated infected T cell motility in lymphoid tissue by preventing stable cellular polarization required for fast migration. Accordingly, disrupting the Nef hydrophobic patch that facilitates actin cytoskeletal perturbation initially accelerates systemic viral dissemination after female genital transmission. However, the same feature of Nef was subsequently critical for viral persistence in immune-competent hosts. Therefore, a highly conserved activity of lentiviral Nef proteins has dual effects and imposes both fitness costs and benefits on the virus at different stages of infection.

Abstract: Heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) is crucial for proteostasis and displays cell-protective effects. Meanwhile, enhanced levels of cell-surface (cs) and secreted HSP70 paradoxically associate with pathologic cardiovascular conditions. However, mechanisms regulating csHSP70 pool are unknown. We hypothesized that total and csHSP70 expressions are modulated by hemodynamic forces, major contributors to endothelial pathophysiology. We also investigated whether thrombomodulin, a crucial thromboresistance cell-surface protein, is a csHSP70 target. We used proteomic/western analysis, confocal microscopy, and cs-biotinylation to analyze the pattern and specific characteristics of intracellular and csHSP70. HSP70 interaction with thrombomodulin was investigated by confocal colocalization, en face immunofluorescence, proximity assay, and immunoprecipitation. Thrombomodulin activity was assessed by measured protein C activation two-step assay. Our results show that csHSP70 pool in endothelial cells (EC) exhibits a peculiar cluster-like pattern and undergoes enhanced expression by physiological arterial-level laminar shear stress. Conversely, total and csHSP70 expressions were diminished under low shear stress, a known proatherogenic hemodynamic pattern. Furthermore, total HSP70 levels were decreased in aortic arch (associated with proatherogenic turbulent flow) compared with thoracic aorta (associated with atheroprotective laminar flow). Importantly, csHSP70 co-localized with thrombomodulin in cultured EC and aorta endothelium; proximity ligation assays and immunoprecipitation confirmed their physical interaction in EC. Remarkably, immunoneutralization of csHSP70 enhanced thrombomodulin activity in EC and aorta ex vivo. Overall, proatherogenic hemodynamic forces promote reduced total HSP70 expression, which might implicate in disturbed proteostasis; meanwhile, the associated decrease in cs-HSP70 pool associates with thromboresistance signaling. Cell-surface HSP70 (csHSP70) expression regulation and csHSP70 targets in vascular cells are unknown. We showed that HSP70 levels are shear stress-modulated and decreased under proatherogenic conditions. Remarkably, csHSP70 binds thrombomodulin and inhibits its activity in endothelial cells. This mechanism can potentially explain some deleterious effects previously associated with high extracellular HSP70 levels, as csHSP70 potentially could restrict thromboresistance and support thrombosis/inflammation in stress situations.

Abstract: Long non-coding RNA HOXA-AS2 (HOXA cluster antisense RNA 2) has been reported to function as an oncogene in different types of cancers including breast cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer, etc. However, its role in the development and progression of bladder cancer remains unknown. This study aimed to examine the expression of HOXA-AS2 in bladder cancer, to explore its role in the migration, invasion and stemness of bladder cancer cells and to further identify the potential downstream target miRNAs of HOXA-AS2 in this type of cancer. Our results firstly demonstrated the upregulation of HOXA-AS2 in both bladder cancer cells and clinical bladder tumors. Such upregulation was also positively correlated with the advanced stage, invasion and lymph node metastasis of bladder cancer as well as the expression of cancer stem cell marker OCT4 in patients. After knockdown of HOXA-AS2 in bladder cancer 5637 and T24 cells, the migration, invasion and stemness of cancer cells were significantly inhibited, indicating the capability of HOXA-AS2 to promote the migration, invasion and stemness of bladder cancer cells. Knockdown of HOXA-AS2 also suppressed in vivo tumor growth in the nude mice. Furthermore, this study also identified miR-125b as a downstream target of HOXA-AS2 and revealed the downregulation of miR-125b by HOXA-AS2 as well as the involvement of HOXA-AS2/miR-125b/Smad2 interactions in the functional role of HOXA-AS2 in mediating the migration, invasion and stemness of bladder cancer cells. Together, our findings suggest that HOXA-AS2 might be a potential biomarker and target for the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of bladder cancer.

Abstract: Cholestasis represents pathophysiologic syndromes defined as an impaired bile flow from the liver. As an outcome, bile acids accumulate and promote hepatocytes injury followed by liver cirrhosis and liver failure. Bile acids induce apoptosis, ER stress and mitochondrial membrane instability. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of cytosolic short form of ALR (Augmenter of Liver Regeneration) in the synthesis of bile acids and bile acid-induced apoptosis. Human hepatoma cells over-expressing the short form of ALR (sfALR, 15 kDa) were incubated with glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), and then primary bile acids’ production and apoptosis were analyzed. High levels of cytosolic sfALR reduced CYP7A1 mRNA expression and bile acids levels, the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic pathway of bile acid synthesis. This reduction was attributed to STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) activation and reduction of HNF4α (Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α). Furthermore, apoptosis induction by GCDCA and TRAIL was reduced in cells over-expressing sfALR which was attributed to reduced expression of death receptor 5 (DR5). We found decreased hepatic mRNA levels of ALR and FOXA2 (Forkhead Box A2), an inducer of ALR expression, in human cholestatic liver samples which might explain the increased accumulation of bile acids and bile acid-induced apoptosis in cholestasis patients.

Abstract: This study aimed to identify critical prognostic molecular markers in Childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and construct nomogram-based model for prognostic prediction. The RNA-sequencing profiles and corresponding clinical information were downloaded from TCGA database. Differential expressed genes (DEG) were screened using limma package, subsequently following by GO and KEGG pathway analysis. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis were performed to screen critical DEGs. Nomogram-based prediction model were constructed to identify clinical factors with independent prognostic values, and the accuracy of this model was validated. A total of 214 DEGs were identified from relapse AML samples compared with non-relapse samples. These DEGs were mainly involved in twenty GO terms and three signaling pathways, such as chromatin assembly or disassembly, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Among these genes, Univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis results showed that relapse and risk score were significantly correlated with survival outcomes. Finally, the accuracy ability of nomogram-based prediction model was validated. These six DEGs (ABCA5, CYP7A1, HERC5, etc.) play major roles in AMLs progression. Our nomogram-based prognostic predictive model might be an effective method to estimate survival probability of AML patients with different risk status.

Abstract: Despite the recognition of the lethality of cancer metastasis and the importance of developing specific anti-metastasis therapies directed at the cancer metastatic cascade, the dynamics of cancer metastasis remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the dynamics of circulating tumor cell (CTC) survival in the bloodstream using experimental mouse models. CTCs were arrested in the capillaries by adhesion to vascular endothelium within a few minutes after injection into the bloodstream. The loss of CTCs from the circulation followed a bi-phasic decay pattern, with the number of CTCs in the bloodstream being closely associated with the number of blood circulation cycles. The calculated in vivo Vd (apparent volume of distribution) of the CTC revealed organ specific binding of the CTCs. Moreover, confocal microscopy, in vivo fluorescence imaging in syngeneic mouse metastatic models and analysis of blood circulation patterns support the notion of organ-specific tumor metastasis. The present study suggests that organ-specific tumor metastasis is influenced by cooperation between blood circulation patterns and ‘seed-soil’ compatibility factors. These new findings provide further insights for optimized cancer metastatic prevention strategies such as by creating a hostile circulation microenvironment and targeting the organ-specific ‘seed–soil’ compatibility factors.

Abstract: The etiological agent of the neglected tropical disease African trypanosomiasis, Trypanosoma brucei, possesses an expanded and diverse repertoire of heat shock proteins, which have been implicated in cytoprotection, differentiation, as well as progression and transmission of the disease. Hsp70 plays a crucial role in proteostasis, and inhibition of its interactions with co-chaperones is emerging as a potential therapeutic target for numerous diseases. In light of genome annotations and the release of the genome sequence of the human infective subspecies, an updated and current in silico overview of the Hsp70/J-protein machinery in both T. brucei brucei and T. brucei gambiense was conducted. Functional, structural, and evolutionary analyses of the T. brucei Hsp70 and J-protein families were performed. The Hsp70 and J-proteins from humans and selected kinetoplastid parasites were used to assist in identifying proteins from T. brucei, as well as the prediction of potential Hsp70–J-protein partnerships. The Hsp70 and J-proteins were mined from numerous genome-wide proteomics studies, which included different lifecycle stages and subcellular localisations. In this study, 12 putative Hsp70 proteins and 67 putative J-proteins were identified to be encoded on the genomes of both T. brucei subspecies. Interestingly there are 6 type III J-proteins that possess tetratricopeptide repeat-containing (TPR) motifs. Overall, it is envisioned that the results of this study will provide a future context for studying the biology of the African trypanosome and evaluating Hsp70 and J-protein interactions as potential drug targets.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of osteo-/dentinogenic differentiation is beneficial for jaw bone and dental tissue regeneration. DLX5 is highly expressed in dental tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and is upregulated by lysine-specific demethylase 4B (KDM4B), enabling it to regulate osteo-/dentinogenic differentiation, while the function of DLX5 in osteo-/dentinogenesis has not been thoroughly elucidated to date. Therefore, we investigated DLX5 function using stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs). SCAPs were obtained from the human wisdom tooth. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay, Alizarin red staining (ARS), quantitative analysis of calcium, osteo-/dentinogenesis-related gene expression and in vivo transplantation were used to determine the osteo-/dentinogenic differentiation potential. Luciferase and ChIP assays were used to investigate the physical relationship between DLX5 and KDM4B. DLX5 and KDM4B were upregulated during osteogenic induction and were induced by BMP4 in SCAPs. Next, we found that DLX5 enhanced ALP activity, mineralization in vitro, and the expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1), osteopontin (OPN), and the key transcription factor osterix (OSX). Moreover, transplant experiments showed that DLX5 promoted osteo-/dentinogenesis in vivo. Interestingly, DLX5 enhanced KDM4B transcription by directly binding with its promoter. In addition, KDM4B upregulated DLX5 in SCAPs. These results indicate that DLX5 and KDM4B are positive effectors of BMP signaling and regulate each other via a positive feedback mechanism. DLX5 enhanced osteo-/dentinogenic differentiation via upregulated KDM4B in SCAPs, suggesting that activation of the DLX5/KDM4B signaling pathway might serve as an intrinsic mechanism that promotes tissue regeneration mediated by dental-derived MSCs.

Abstract: Thermotolerance is a phenomenon in which cells become resistant to stress by prior exposure to heat shock, and its development is associated with the induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps), including Hsp70. We previously showed that the expression of Hsp70 is regulated by the cytokine signaling transcription factor Stat3, but the role of Stat3 in thermotolerance is not known. In this study, we examined the possible involvement of Stat3 in the acquisition of thermotolerance. We found that severe heat shock-induced morphological changes and decreases in cell viability, which were suppressed by exposure to non-lethal mild heat shock prior to severe heat shock. This thermotolerance development was accompanied by Stat3 phosphorylation and the induction of Hsps such as Hsp105, Hsp70, and Hsp27. Stat3 phosphorylation and Hsp induction were inhibited by AG490, an inhibitor of JAK tyrosine kinase. Consistent with this, we found that mild heat shock-induced thermotolerance was partially suppressed by AG490 or knockdown of Hsp105. We also found that the Stat3 inhibitor Stattic suppresses the acquisition of thermotolerance by inhibiting the mild heat shock-induced Stat3 phosphorylation and Hsp105 expression. These results suggest that the mild heat shock-dependent stimulation of the JAK-Stat signaling pathway contributes to the development of thermotolerance via the induction of Hsps including Hsp105. This signaling pathway may be a useful target for hyperthermia cancer therapy.

Abstract: Microtubule associated tumor suppressor 1 (MTUS1) has been recognized as a tumor suppressor gene in multiple cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of MTUS1 are yet to be investigated. This study aimed to clarify the significance of DNA methylation in silencing MTUS1 expression. We report that MTUS1 acts as tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Analysis of in silico database and subsequent knockdown of DNMT1 suggested an inverse correlation between DNMT1 and MTUS1 function. Interestingly, increased methylation at MTUS1 promoter is associated with low expression of MTUS1. Treatment with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitor, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AZA) leads to both reduced promoter methylation accompanied with enrichment of H3K9Ac and enhanced MTUS1 expression. Remarkably, knockdown of MTUS1 showed increased proliferation and migration of NSCLC cells in contrast to diminished proliferation and migration, upon treatment with AZA. We concluded that low expression of MTUS1 correlates to DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in human NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Cell cycle progression and cell fate decisions are closely linked in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). However, the study of these interplays at the molecular level remains challenging due to the lack of efficient methods allowing cell cycle synchronization of large quantities of cells. Here, we screened inhibitors of cell cycle progression and identified nocodazole as the most efficient small molecule to synchronize hPSCs in the G2/M phase. Following nocodazole treatment, hPSCs remain pluripotent, retain a normal karyotype and can successfully differentiate into the three germ layers and functional cell types. Moreover, genome-wide transcriptomic analyses on single cells synchronized for their cell cycle and differentiated toward the endoderm lineage validated our findings and showed that nocodazole treatment has no effect on gene expression during the differentiation process. Thus, our synchronization method provides a robust approach to study cell cycle mechanisms in hPSCs.

Abstract: Enucleated mammalian cells (cytoplasts) have been widely used for studying differential roles of the cytoplasm and nucleus in various cellular processes. Here, we reported an improved enucleation protocol, in which cells were seeded in extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated 24-wells and spun at 4600 g and 35 °C for 60 min in the presence of cytochalasin B and colchicine. When glass-bottom wells were used, cellular structures and organelles in cytoplasts could be examined directly by confocal microscopy. Nuclear envelope rupture did not occur probably due to mild centrifugation conditions used in this study. Addition of paclitaxel or doxorubicin completely blocked proliferation of residual nucleated cells; however, to our surprise, paclitaxel dramatically prolonged the survival of cytoplasts. Results from Annexin V and Propidium Iodide staining showed that cytoplasts died predominantly by apoptosis, which was partially inhibited by ECM and further by paclitaxel. Mitochondria were mostly rod-shaped and formed a connected network in paclitaxel-treated cytoplasts, indicating lack of fusion and fission dynamics. Moreover, paclitaxel increased mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting that perturbation of mitochondria might be critical to the survival of cytoplasts. In conclusion, we had established an efficient and fast procedure for enucleation of adherent animal cells, which could facilitate the investigation of nucleocytoplasmic interaction.

Abstract: Background
Recently, a small peptide called Hepcidin, was found to have an important role in regulating the iron metabolism in anemia of chronic disease (ACD) patients. Hepcidin is regulated by a variety of conditions at the transcriptional level. Therefore, our study aims to predict the level of hepcidin serum using inflammation markers and iron indicators in patients afflicted with ACD and observe how this severity of inflammation separated the level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well the as hepcidin level.
Methods
A cross-sectional data analysis was conducted on 80 ACD adult patients treated at the Sanglah Teaching Hospital in Bali, Indonesia. We used hepcidin serum and several markers, such as the hemoglobin level, inflammation markers, renal function tests, IL-6, and iron indicators, to predict the hepcidin level.
Results
This study recruited 80 ACD patients, comprising 45 men (56.3%) and 35 women (43.7%). The mean age of the participants was 43±16.5 years. Only IL-6, ferritin and serum creatinine correlate significantly with serum hepcidin from seven variables that were previously eligible to enter the analysis. This study found the model to predict the hepcidin level using IL-6 ferritin and the creatinine level as the hepcidin level (predicted)=−23.76+0.396 (IL 6)+0.448 (ferritin)+0.310 (creatinine).
Conclusion
This study has revealed that the creatinine level, ferritin and IL-6 can be used to predict the hepcidin level in patients with anemia of chronic disease. It is to be hoped that further cohort studies can validate our formula to predict the hepcidin level.

Abstract: Objective
To assess clinical outcomes of intolerant, relapsed or refractory patients who could not be treated with new tyrosine kinase inhibitors or experimental therapies.
Methods
A retrospective cohort of 90 chronic myeloid leukemia patients in all phases of the disease treated with imatinib mesylate as their first TKI therapy, and with dasatinib or nilotinib as the next line of therapy. We evaluated clinical outcomes of these patients, with special focus on the group that needed more than two therapy lines.
Results
Thirty-nine percent of patients were refractory or intolerant to imatinib. An 8-year overall survival rate of the patients who went through three or more lines of treatment was significantly lower, compared to those who were able to maintain imatinib as their first-line therapy (83% and 22%, respectively p<0.01). Decreased overall survival was associated with advanced-phase disease (p<0.01), failure to achieve major molecular response in first-line treatment (p<0.01) and interruption of first-line treatment due to any reason (p=0.023). Failure in achieving complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response and treatment interruption were associated with the progression to the third-line treatment.
Conclusion
The critical outcome observed in relapsed, intolerant or refractory chronic phase CML patients reflects the unmet need for this group of patients without an alternative therapy, such as new drugs or experimental therapies in clinical trials. Broader access to newer treatment possibilities is a crucial asset to improve survival among CML patients, especially those refractory or intolerant to first-line therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Self-propagating amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates or seeds possibly drive pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Small molecules targeting such structures might act therapeutically in vivo. Here, a fluorescence polarization assay was established that enables the detection of compound effects on both seeded and spontaneous Aβ42 aggregation. In a focused screen of anti-amyloid compounds, we identified Disperse Orange 1 (DO1) ([4-((4-nitrophenyl)diazenyl)-N-phenylaniline]), a small molecule that potently delays both seeded and non-seeded Aβ42 polymerization at substoichiometric concentrations. Mechanistic studies revealed that DO1 disrupts preformed fibrillar assemblies of synthetic Aβ42 peptides and decreases the seeding activity of Aβ aggregates from brain extracts of AD transgenic mice. DO1 also reduced the size and abundance of diffuse Aβ plaques and decreased neuroinflammation-related gene expression changes in brains of 5xFAD transgenic mice. Finally, improved nesting behavior was observed upon treatment with the compound. Together, our evidence supports targeting of self-propagating Aβ structures with small molecules as a valid therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Decitabine and low-dose chemotherapy are common treatments for intermediate and high risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In this study, we retrospectively assessed the efficacy and toxicity of the two regimens for MDS-refractory anemia with excess blasts (MDS-RAEB) patients. A total of 112 patients with a diagnosis of MDS-RAEB are included. The overall response (OR) and complete remission (CR) rate was comparable between the two groups (OR: 64.1% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.60; CR: 23.4% vs. 31.3%, p = 0.64). The OR rates of 20 mg/m2/day and 15 mg/m2/day decitabine regimen were comparable (69.0% vs. 60.0%, p = 0.46). Overall survival (OS) did not differ significantly between the groups (20.7 vs. 13.5 months, p = 0.17). In a subgroup analysis that included only patients at ≥60 years of age, survival benefit of decitabine was apparent (20.6 vs. 10.0 months, p = 0.03). In hematological toxicities, the lowest count of platelet in the decitabine group was higher significantly. And, the incidence of Grade 3–4 infection in the decitabine group was lower significantly. Our results demonstrate that both decitabine and low-dose chemotherapy are effective for MDS-RAEB, but decitabine was safer. Decitabine might be a better choice for patients at ≥60 years of age.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitin-like (Ubl) post-translational modifications are potential targets for therapeutics. However, the only known mechanism for inhibiting a Ubl-activating enzyme is through targeting its ATP-binding site. Here we identify an allosteric inhibitory site in the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-activating enzyme (E1). This site was unexpected because both it and analogous sites are deeply buried in all previously solved structures of E1s of ubiquitin-like modifiers (Ubl). The inhibitor not only suppresses SUMO E1 activity, but also enhances its degradation in vivo, presumably due to a conformational change induced by the compound. In addition, the lead compound increased the expression of miR-34b and reduced c-Myc levels in lymphoma and colorectal cancer cell lines and a colorectal cancer xenograft mouse model. Identification of this first-in-class inhibitor of SUMO E1 is a major advance in modulating Ubl modifications for therapeutic aims.

Abstract: Introduction
Hemophilia is a coagulopathy caused by a deficiency in coagulation factors VIII (hemophilia A) or IX (hemophilia B). It is a chronic disease and, hence, impairs the quality of life (Qol) of the patients. This study aimed to evaluate the Qol of patients with hemophilia using the WHOQOL-bref and the Haemo-A-Qol instruments, its relation to the clinical condition and its sociodemographic variables.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional, epidemiological study, comprising 17 patients with hemophilia, registered at the hemocenter, who met the eligibility criteria. Data were collected using three questionnaires: a semi-structured clinical evaluation form, the WHOQOL-bref and the Haem-A-Qol.
Results
The average age was 30 years old, and most participants declared themselves to be single (58.82%), without children (64.70%) and employed (58.82%). Hemophilia A was observed in 14 patients and the most severe form of the disease was more prevalent (64.70%). The average score of Qol, estimated by the WHOQOL-bref questionnaire was 74.3; being “social relations” the domain with the highest average. The Haem-A-Qol measured an average of 36.2 and the domain with the highest result was “Family Planning”.
Conclusion
Hemophilia had a higher negative impact upon the physical, sports and leisure features in the sample subjects. The analysis of the questionnaires did not reveal statistical agreement between them. Based on this, the Haem-A-Qol is considered the most recommended to evaluate the Qol, as it addresses factors more specifically related to the disease. No statistical significance was observed between the scores of Qol, as for the presence of comorbidities, gravity of the hemophilia and positive serology for infections.

Abstract: Objectives
Small for gestational age infants (SGA), infants of diabetic mothers (IDM), and very low birth weight infants (VLBW) are at risk for congenital iron deficiency. We evaluated the iron status of SGA, IDM, and VLBW neonates at birth and sought mechanistic explanations in those with iron deficiency.
Methods
This was a prospective study. If congenital iron deficiency was present, maternal iron studies were obtained. When neonates were two weeks old, their iron status was reevaluated.
Results
Sixteen of 180 neonates screened were iron deficient at birth. The Body Mass Index of the 16 mothers was high. These mothers often had mild iron deficiency and measurable hepcidin levels. Two weeks after birth, neonates had improved iron measurements.
Conclusions
Among SGA, IDM, and VLBW neonates, maternal obesity is a risk factor for congenital iron deficiency. We speculate that elevated hepcidin levels in obese pregnant women impede iron absorption and interfere with transplacental iron transfer.

Abstract: Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is, if untreated, a fatal hematologic neoplasia. Failure of the first induction chemotherapy is a hallmark for a poor prognosis. Early recognition of therapy failure is crucial for planning further therapies. Therefore, international guidelines recommend a bone marrow biopsy around day 14 after the beginning of induction therapy. Hypocellular bone marrow on day 14 is still gold standard for therapy assessment and further therapy strategy. Despite this, non-invasive ways for the evaluation of induction therapy were looked for in the past years.
Methods
We collected peripheral blood cell counts and routine laboratory values of patients treated with “7 + 3” induction therapy. Ratios of absolute cell counts of monocytes and neutrophils (MNR) were calculated daily, and the values were compared in patients with failure of the first induction therapy and patients with therapy response.
Results
54 patients were included, 12 of which had failure of first induction therapy. The MNR following therapy was highly correlated with the bone marrow results. With the right cut-off, the MNR provides a valid and reliable tool for identification of patients with failure of first induction therapy with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 87.8% on day 18.
Conclusions
We propose a novel and non-invasive method for detection of failure of first induction therapy in patients with de novo AML and “7 + 3” induction therapy. The MNR is free of cost since the required cell counts are performed routinely for each patient undergoing intensive chemotherapy.

Abstract: Background
Assessing trends in the rate of transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) in blood donors is critical to the monitoring of the blood supply safety and the donor screening effectiveness. The objective of this study was to conduct a trend analysis of TTIs and associated demographic factors of donors at a public blood bank in the central Brazil.
Methods
A retrospective analysis (2010–2016) of blood donation data was performed to determine the prevalence of markers for TTIs. Multinomial and multivariate logistic regression were used to verify the association between the explanatory variables and TTIs. The trend was evaluated with the Prais Winsten’s regression analysis.
Results
The prevalence of TTIs was 4.04% (5,553 donors) among 137,209 donors, with a steady trend in the analyzed period. The seroprevalence for the hepatitis B virus (HBV), syphilis, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Chagas disease, and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) were 1.63%, 0.87%, 0.46%, 0.21%, 0.21% and 0.09%, respectively. The prevalence of HBV decreased (b = −0.021, p <  0.001), while syphilis increased (b = 0.112; p =  0.001), during the period investigated. The probability for a positive test for TTI was higher among donors with a low level of education, aged ≥30 years old, without stable marital status, and first-time donors.
Conclusions
Even with the reduction in HBV, the increased rate of syphilis may have contributed to the fact that the overall rate of TTIs did not decrease in the evaluated period.

Abstract: Ras-activated ERK pathway (Raf–MEK–ERK phosphorylation cascade) regulates a variety of cellular responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. DA-Raf1 (DA-Raf) is a splicing variant of A-Raf and contains the Ras-binding domain but lacks the kinase domain. Accordingly, DA-Raf antagonizes the Ras–ERK pathway in a dominant-negative manner. Here we show that DA-Raf plays essential roles in skeletal myocyte differentiation including myoblast fusion and in apoptosis, which are suppressed by the Ras–ERK pathway. Expression of DA-Raf was highly induced in C2C12 skeletal myocytes in a low serum concentration of differentiation condition and in NIH3T3 fibroblasts under a serum starvation apoptosis-inducing condition. Stable knockdown of DA-Raf resulted in suppression of muscle-specific gene expression, myoblast fusion, and apoptosis. In contrast, exogenous overexpression of DA-Raf prominently caused apoptosis. DA-Raf induces apoptosis by preventing ERK–RSK-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of Bad. Although it has been reported that apoptosis triggers myoblast fusion, DA-Raf-induced apoptosis was not involved in myoblast fusion in C2C12 cells. These results imply that suppression of the Ras–ERK pathway by DA-Raf is essential for both myocyte differentiation including myoblast fusion and apoptosis but that apoptosis is not a prerequisite for myoblast fusion.

Abstract: Cripto-1 is a protein participating in tissue orientation during embryogenesis but has also been implicated in a wide variety of cancers, such as colon, lung and breast cancer. Cripto-1 plays a role in the regulation of different pathways, including TGF-β/Smad and Wnt/β-catenin, which are highly associated with cell migration both during embryonal development and cancer progression. Little is known about the detailed subcellular localization of cripto-1 and how it participates in the directional movement of cells. In this study, the subcellular localization of cripto-1 in glioblastoma cells was investigated in vitro with high-resolution microscopy techniques. Cripto-1 was found to be localized to dynamic and shed filopodia and transported between cells through tunneling nanotubes. Our results connect the refined subcellular localization of cripto-1 to its functions in cellular orientation and migration.

Abstract: Summary
Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a significant clinical challenge due to limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are the cellular units responsible for relapse in AML, and strategies that target LSCs are thus critical. One proposed potential strategy to this end is to break the quiescent state of LSCs, thereby sensitizing LSCs to conventional cytostatics. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway is a main driver of cellular quiescence and a potential therapeutic target, with precedence from both solid cancers and leukemias. Here, we used a conditional knockout Hif-1α mouse model together with a standard chemotherapy regimen to evaluate LSC targeting in AML. Contrary to expectation, our studies revealed that Hif-1α-deleted-leukemias displayed a faster disease progression after chemotherapy. Our studies thereby challenge the general notion of cancer stem cell sensitization by inhibition of the HIF pathway, and warrant caution when applying HIF inhibition in combination with chemotherapy in AML.

Abstract: Very promising results have been observed with a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccine based on human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) antigen retention and delivery system in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the mechanism by which these antigens are processed once they reach this organelle is still unknown. Therefore, we evaluated whether this system awakens a stress response in the ER. Different DNA constructs based on E6 and E7 mutant antigens fused to an ER signal peptide (SP), a signal for retention in the ER (KDEL), or both signals (SPK), were transfected into HEK-293 cells. Overexpression of E6 and E7 antigens targeted to the ER (SP, and SPK constructs) induced ER stress, which was indicated by an increase of the ER-stress markers GRP78/BiP and CHOP. Additionally, the ER stress response was mediated by the ATF4 transcription factor, which was translocated into the nucleus. Besides, the overexpressed antigens were degraded by the proteasome. Through a cycloheximide-chase assay, we demonstrated that when both protein synthesis and proteasome were inhibited, the overexpressed antigens were degraded. Interestingly, when proteasome was blocked autophagy was increased and the ER stress response decreased. Taken together, these results indicate that the antigens are initially degraded by the ERAD pathway, and autophagy degradation pathway can be induced to compensate the proteasome inhibition. Therefore, we provided a new insight into the mechanism by which E6 and E7 mutant antigens are processed once they reach the ER, which will help to improve the development of more effective vaccines against cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Clostridium scindens biotransforms primary bile acids into secondary bile acids, and is correlated with inhibition of Clostridium difficile growth in vivo. The aim of the current study was to determine how C. scindens regulates C. difficile growth in vitro and if these interactions might relate to the regulation of gut microbiome structure in vivo. The bile acid 7α-dehydroxylating gut bacteria, C. scindens and C. sordellii, were found to secrete the tryptophan-derived antibiotics, 1-acetyl-β-carboline and turbomycin A, respectively. Both antibiotics inhibited growth of C. difficile and other gut bacteria. The secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, but not cholic acid, enhanced the inhibitory activity of these antibiotics. These antibiotics appear to inhibit cell division of C. difficile. The results help explain how endogenously synthesized antibiotics and secondary bile acids may regulate C. difficile growth and the structure of the gut microbiome in health and disease.

Abstract: Clip-domain serine proteases (Clip-SPs) mediate innate immunity and embryonic development in insects. However, the function of Clip-SPs in Apis cerana cerana is little known. Here, a Clip-SP gene, AccSp1, was identified. AccSp1 was mainly detected in third and sixth day instar larvae, dark-eyed pupae, and adults (1and 30 days post-emergence). In addition, AccSp1 was expressed at its highest level in the venom gland and epidermis than tentacle, abdomen, muscle, honey sac, head, leg, chest, hemolymph, rectum, and midgut. AccSp1 was induced by 4, 24, and 44 °C; H2O2; CdCl2; HgCl2; and pesticides (paraquat, pyridaben, and methomyl) and was inhibited by UV light and cyhalothrin treatments. When adults that had been pretreated with dsRNA 6 h prior (knocking AccSp1 down) were challenged with Bacillus bombysepticus for 18 h, the survival rate of bees greatly decreased, the activity of PO (phenoloxidase) was reduced, revealing that AccSp1 may play a critical role in assisting bees to survive the microbial infection and participate in regulating PO activity. The antioxidant enzymatic activities of catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase; the contents of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde; and the ratio of NADP+/NADPH were all lower in samples containing dsRNA-AccSp1 interference than in control groups, but the content of carbonyl was not significantly different. These findings suggest the knockdown of AccSp1 may influence melanization so that the antioxidant enzyme activities and the harmful metabolites decreased. These results collectively suggest that AccSp1 plays critical roles in abiotic stresses responses and resistance to pathogens.

Abstract: In beta-thalassemia patients, erythrocyte autoantibodies can remain silent or lead to Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA).The aim of this study was to identify predictors of AIHA in beta-thalassemia patients with positive Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT), in Tunisia. This longitudinal prognosis study was carried out on beta-thalassemia patients with a positive confirmed DAT. Predictors of AIHA were identified the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox model analysis was used to identify independent predictors. Among 385 beta thalassemia patients, 87 developed positive DAT (22.6%). Autoimmune hemolytic anemia was occurred in 25 patients. Multivariate analysis showed that AIHA was independently associated with beta-thalassemia intermedia and similar family history of AIHA. Splenectomy in patients with positive DAT was independently associated with an increased risk of AIHA (HR = 6.175, CI: 2.049–18.612, p < 0.001). The risk of developing AIHA was higher during the first 72 transfusions. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia was significantly associated with polyspecific DAT (anti-complement and anti-IgG), blood group AB and prior alloimmunization. Whereas transfusion by phenotypic and leukoreduced blood was a protective factor. In summary, splenectomy after autoimmunization, prior alloimmunization, DAT specificity (IgG with complement), thalassemia intermedia, AB blood group and family history of AIHA were strongly associated with AIHA. Leukoreduced blood transfusion had a proven preventive role.

Abstract: Excessive red cell dehydration contributes to the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD). The densest fraction of sickle red cells (with the highest corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) undergoes the most rapid polymerization of deoxy-hemoglobin S, leading to accelerated cell sickling and increased susceptibility to endothelial activation, red cell adhesion, and vaso-occlusion. Increasing red cell volume in order to decrease red cell density can thus serve as an adjunct therapeutic goal in SCD. Regulation of circulating mouse red cell volume and density is mediated largely by the Gardos channel, KCNN4, and the K-Cl cotransporters, KCC3 and KCC1. Whereas inhibition of the Gardos channel in subjects with sickle cell disease increased red cell volume, decreased red cell density, and improved other hematological indices in subjects with SCD, specific KCC inhibitors have not been available for testing. We therefore investigated the effect of genetic inactivation of KCC3 and KCC1 in the SAD mouse model of sickle red cell dehydration, finding decreased red cell density and improved hematological indices. We describe here generation of mice genetically deficient in the three major red cell volume regulatory gene products, KCNN4, KCC3, and KCC1 in C57BL6 non-sickle and SAD sickle backgrounds. We show that combined loss-of-function of all three gene products in SAD mice leads to incrementally increased MCV, decreased CHCM and % hyperchromic cells, decreased red cell density (phthalate method), increased resistance to hypo-osmotic lysis, and increased cell K content. The data show that combined genetic deletion of the Gardos channel and K-Cl cotransporters in a mouse SCD model decreases red cell density and improves several hematological parameters, supporting the strategy of combined pharmacological inhibition of these ion transport pathways in the adjunct treatment of human SCD.

Abstract: Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) is the main type of Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and is a common otorhinolaryngologic disease worldwide. However, the mechanisms of CRSsNP remain poorly understood. In this study, C57BL/6J wild-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene knockout (uPA-/-) mice were used to construct the CRSsNP model. Primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) were isolated from CRSsNP patient and treated with uPA knockdown/overexpression lentivirus. CCK-8 and Annexin-V/PI staining were used to detected cell proliferation and apoptosis. In vivo, we found that uPA depletion alleviated mucosal inflammation in the CRSsNP mice model. Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) was upregulated in the uPA-/- CRSsNP mice model. In vitro, inhibition of uPA increased cell proliferation and decreased cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, uPA depletion upregulated WIF1 and BCL2 expression, and reduced the expression level of BAX in CRSsNP HNEC. In contrast, decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis were observed after uPA overexpression. Consistently, a reduction in WIF1 and BCL2 expression levels and an increase in the BAX expression level were observed upon uPA ectopic expression. Furthermore, WIF1 overexpression rescued the effects caused by uPA overexpression in vitro. In conclusion, uPA affects the CRSsNP nasal mucosal epithelium cell apoptosis by upregulating WIF1. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the role of uPA in CRSsNP to date.

Abstract: Objectives
Aplastic anemia (AA) is T cell immune-mediated autoimmune disease. Aberrant T cell activation involves an imbalance in T cell homeostasis in AA. However, whether the T cell activation molecule CD27 and its ligand CD70 participate in the immune pathogenesis of AA remains ill defined.
Methods
The frequencies of CD27/CD70 and perforin/granzyme B in different T cell subsets were detected in AA patients and healthy individuals by flow cytometry.
Results
We first time demonstrate a significantly elevated proportion of CD27+ and significantly decreased CD70+ T cells from AA. Changed frequency of CD27+ and CD70+ in different T cell subsets appeared to be associated with AA severity. In very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) and severe aplastic anemia (SAA), increased CD8+CD27+ T cells present with a cytotoxic effector phenotype by elevating perforin proportion.
Conclusions
Elevated proportion of CD27 in T cells may contribute to distinct immune pathogenesis for different severities of AA. The CD8+CD27+perforin+ T cells combined with CD8+CD70+ T cells may serve as an immune biomarker for AA severity estimation.

Abstract: Summary
We have characterized the structure and dynamics of the carbohydrate-modifying enzyme Paenibacillus nanensis xanthan lyase (PXL) involved in the degradation of xanthan by X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering, and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Unlike other xanthan lyases, PXL is specific for both unmodified mannose and pyruvylated mannose, which we find is correlated with structural differences in the substrate binding groove. The structure of the full-length enzyme reveals two additional C-terminal modules, one of which belongs to a new non-catalytic carbohydrate binding module family. Ca2+ are critical for the activity and conformation of PXL, and we show that their removal by chelating agents results in localized destabilization/unfolding of particularly the C-terminal modules. We use the structure and the revealed impact of Ca2+ coordination on conformational dynamics to guide the engineering of PXL variants with increased activity and stability in a chelating environment, thus expanding the possibilities for industrial applications of PXL.

Abstract: Although enhanced Red Blood Cell (RBC) - Endothelial Cell (EC) interaction, as well as RBC induced EC activation, have been extensively studied in several RBC-linked pathologies, the specific individual effects of oxidatively modified RBC on EC activation has not yet been documented. However, increasing evidence in both experimental and clinical studies suggests that oxidatively modified RBC could be considered potential pathogenic determinants in several acute and chronic diseases displaying systemic oxidative stress. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the specific effects of oxidized RBC interaction with endothelial cells on intracellular signaling pathways that promote EC activation. RBC were exposed to oxidative stress induced by phenazine methosulphate (PMS). It is shown that the interaction of oxidatively modified RBC with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) results in: a) EC activation as indicated by the increased surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule −1 (ICAM-1); b) the activation of transcription factor NF-κB, an indicator of cellular oxidant stress. These results emphasize the specific contribution of oxidatively modified RBC interaction to EC activation and their possible pathological role in vascular diseases and oxidative stress.

Abstract: A young Indian female visited hospital as a suspected case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with relapsed thrombotic complications with low platelet counts, infarct in middle cerebral artery and thrombi in microvessels. We first confirmed the deficiency of ADAMTS13 metalloprotease in this patient showing improper cleavage of vWF multimers by her plasma unlike her parents and brother. Although patient had very less ADAMTS13 antigen in plasma, but it did not appear to be the cause of deficiency of the enzyme, because her father had similarly low antigen level and he never had prothrombotic complications. While investigating the genetic change in ADAMTS13, we observed four homozygous-SNPs (g.420T>C, g.1342C>G, g.1716G>A and g.2280T>C) in exon 5, 12, 15 and 19 respectively in patient and her father unlike the heterozygous form of same SNPs in mother and brother. Further to investigate the cause of ADAMTS13 deficiency, we observed an elevated level of antibody against ADAMTS13 in patient unlike her father and other family members. Our study therefore provides the molecular approach of diagnosis of TTP in this patient and also highlights the use of such techniques in India. More importantly, study provides the clue of alternate treatment such as immunosuppressant therapy to this patient.

Abstract: Introduction
The incidence of grade 3–4 anemia was reported to be 3% with imatinib therapy for newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase (CP). However, there are few data regarding the causes and the development of anemia after long-term treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of anemia after at least two years of imatinib treatment of CML patients in the CP and to identify other contributing causes of anemia in this population.
Patients and methods
We performed a retrospective analysis of 97 CML patients in the CP treated with imatinib for at least two years. We analyzed the hemoglobin (Hb) levels of CML patients at diagnosis, upon initiation of treatment with imatinib and after two years of imatinib treatment, and investigated other causes of anemia in this population.
Results
Most of the patients presented Hb levels below the normal range (80.4%) after the second year of treatment, 17.9% grade 2 and 1.3% grade 3. In 13 cases (16.7%), anemia was attributed to resistance and in 13 cases (16.7%) the following causes were identified: iron deficiency (n=5), hypothyroidism (n=2), vitamin B12 deficiency (n=3), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (n=1), pulmonary tuberculosis (n=1) and renal toxicity (n=1). In 52 patients (66.6%), there were no other factors contributing to anemia, except imatinib treatment.
Conclusion
Regular follow-up is required to identify the causes of anemia not related to CML or imatinib toxicity. The importance of investigating secondary causes of anemia should be emphasized, especially in patients with good adherence to treatment and satisfactory therapeutic response.

Abstract: Summary
Mosquitoes are hematophagous vectors that can acquire human viruses in their intestinal tract. Here, we define a mosquito gut commensal bacterium that promotes permissiveness to arboviruses. Antibiotic depletion of gut bacteria impaired arboviral infection of a lab-adapted Aedes aegypti mosquito strain. Reconstitution of individual cultivable gut bacteria in antibiotic-treated mosquitoes identified Serratia marcescens as a commensal bacterium critical for efficient arboviral acquisition. S. marcescens facilitates arboviral infection through a secreted protein named SmEnhancin, which digests membrane-bound mucins on the mosquito gut epithelia, thereby enhancing viral dissemination. Field Aedes mosquitoes positive for S. marcescens were more permissive to dengue virus infection than those free of S. marcescens. Oral introduction of S. marcescens into field mosquitoes that lack this bacterium rendered these mosquitoes highly susceptible to arboviruses. This study defines a commensal-driven mechanism that contributes to vector competence, and extends our understanding of multipartite interactions among hosts, the gut microbiome, and viruses.

Abstract: Summary
The Hippo pathway coordinates extracellular signals onto the control of tissue homeostasis and organ size. Hippo signaling primarily regulates the ability of Yap1 to bind and co-activate TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors. Yap1 tightly binds to TEAD4 via a large flat interface, making the development of small-molecule orthosteric inhibitors highly challenging. Here, we report small-molecule TEAD⋅Yap inhibitors that rapidly and selectively form a covalent bond with a conserved cysteine located within the unique deep hydrophobic palmitate-binding pocket of TEADs. Inhibition of TEAD4 binding to Yap1 by these compounds was irreversible and occurred on a longer time scale. In mammalian cells, the compounds formed a covalent complex with TEAD4, inhibited its binding to Yap1, blocked its transcriptional activity, and suppressed expression of connective tissue growth factor. The compounds inhibited cell viability of patient-derived glioblastoma spheroids, making them suitable as chemical probes to explore Hippo signaling in cancer.

Abstract: The molecular mechanisms responsible for disease progression of CML are not conclusive. The main functional changes associated with disease evolution in CML was high proliferation rate, decreased apoptosis, blockade of differentiation, and strong resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. The current study analyzed the relative expressional profiles of genes related with proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as c-MYC, BAD, BCL-2, C/EBPα/-β and ABCB1 respectively in different clinical stages of CML by SYBR Green I quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR. We selected a total of 183 CML patients and 30 healthy control samples. The study populations were classified into four groups, including de novo CML-CP (50/183), CML-AP (32/183), CML-BC (51/183) and Imatinib Mesylate or IM resistant CML-CP (50/183) groups. qRT PCR analysis revealed that significant overexpression of c-MYC, ABCB1 and BCL-2 was observed in advanced phases and IM resistant CP of CML compared to healthy controls. Likewise, the mean expression level of BAD, C/EBPα/-β genes were found to be significantly down regulated. Present study concluded that the complex interplay of several candidate genes like overexpression of c-MYC, ABCB1, BCL-2 and down regulation of BAD, C/EBPα/-β played a significant role in the disease evolution and development of drug resistant in CML.

Abstract: Purpose
The present study aimed to identify the molecular mechanism of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and explore valuable prognostic biomarkers for relapsed ALL.
Methods
Gene expression dataset including 59 samples from ALL survivals without recurrence (good group) and 114 samples from dead ALL patients died of recurrence (poor group) was downloaded from TCGA database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between good and poor groups, followed by pathway and functional enrichment analyses. Subsequently, logistic regression model and survival analysis were performed.
Results
In total, 637 up- and 578 down-regulated DEGs were revealed between good and poor groups. These DEGs were mainly enriched in functions including transcription and pathways like focal adhesion. Genes including alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1), zinc finger protein 695 (ZNF695), actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4), calreticulin (CALR), and F-Box and leucine rich repeat protein 5 (FBXL5) were outstanding in survival analysis.
Conclusion
Transcription and focal adhesion might play important roles in ALL progression. Furthermore, genes including ALPK1, ZNF695, ACTN4, CALR, and FBXL5 might be novel prognostic genes for relapsed ALL.

Abstract: Summary
There is a scarcity of pharmacological tools to interrogate protein kinase function in Plasmodium parasites, the causative agent of malaria. Among Plasmodium's protein kinases, those characterized as atypical represent attractive drug targets as they lack sequence similarity to human proteins. Here, we describe takinib as a small molecule to bind the atypical P. falciparum protein kinase 9 (PfPK9). PfPK9 phosphorylates the Plasmodium E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme PfUBC13, which mediates K63-linkage-specific polyubiquitination. Takinib is a potent human TAK1 inhibitor, thus we developed the Plasmodium-selective takinib analog HS220. We demonstrate that takinib and HS220 decrease K63-linked ubiquitination in P. falciparum, suggesting PfPK9 inhibition in cells. Takinib and HS220 induce a unique phenotype where parasite size in hepatocytes increases, yet high compound concentrations decrease the number of parasites. Our studies highlight the role of PK9 in regulating parasite development and the potential of targeting Plasmodium kinases for malaria control.

Abstract: Background
Blood transfusion-transmitted infections in individuals suffering from beta-thalassemia have been reported in Pakistan, but the information on their sociodemographic and clinical determinants is lacking. This study aims to describe the prevalence, as well as the factors, contributing in blood transfusion-transmitted infections.
Method
Between December 2011 and December 2013, in a non-probable sampling, 350 thalassemia patients were recruited in Lahore, Multan, Karachi and Peshawar, Pakistan. Subjects were screened for transfusion-transmitted infections.
Results
A seropositive rate of 36.5% was observed; males (94, 73.4%) and females (34, 26.6%). Among several risk factors associated with transfusion-transmitted infections, province (p=0.001), gender (p=0.003), age (p<0.03), education (p<0.00), degree of consanguinity (p=0.05), age at fetal blood test (p=0.005), fetal hemoglobin levels (p=0.005), death due to thalassemia (p=0.001) and iron-related complications (p=0.04) showed significant correlation. Participants with an age >10 years were significantly more prone to seropositivity than those aged ≤10 years. Moreover, the ferritin level was also significantly higher in those aged >10 years than in those ≤10 years. It was observed that males had a higher seroprevalence rate (94, 73.4%) than females (34, 26.6%). The most prevalent transfusion-transmitted infections was the hepatitis C virus, with 115 cases (89.8%).
Conclusion
A high prevalence rate of HCV in subjects with transfusion-dependent thalassemia is linked with insufficient facilities, poor management and compromised socioeconomic status. Therefore, more multicenter studies covering cities from different regions of the country are needed in order to develop preventive measurements at the regional and national level.

Abstract: Human phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate adaptor protein-2 (FAPP2) is well-known to function as a cytoplasmic lipid transfer protein during vesicle maturation. However, the expression and role of FAPP2 in tumor remain elusive. In this study, data from immunohistochemical assays displayed that FAPP2 was remarkably upregulated (57.8%) in 90 cases of colon cancer samples in contrast to their corresponding adjacent tissues. Disruption of FAPP2 by CRISPR/Cas9 technique in colon cancer cells led to an attenuated effect on cell growth analyzed by CCK8 and colony formation assays. Meanwhile, the tumorigenicity of FAPP2 downregulated cells also decreased in nude mice model. Accordantly, CCK8 assays also indicated that FAPP2 overexpression could promote colon cancer cell growth. In addition, dual luciferase reporter assays and western blot analyses revealed that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was involved in the FAPP2-regulated tumor cell growth. These findings suggest that FAPP2 could act as an oncogene in the regulation of tumor growth and may provide a new therapeutic target for human colon cancer.

Abstract: The aberrant regulation of the epithelial barrier integrity is involved in many diseases of the digestive tract, including inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer. Intestinal epithelial cell organoid cultures provide new perspectives for analyses of the intestinal barrier in vitro. However, established methods of barrier function analyses from two dimensional cultures have to be adjusted to the analysis of three dimensional organoid structures. Here we describe the methodology for analysis of epithelial barrier function and molecular regulation in intestinal organoids. Barrier responses to interferon-γ of intestinal organoids with and without epithelial cell-specific deletion of the interferon-γ-receptor 2 gene were used as a model system. The established method allowed monitoring of the kinetics of interferon-γ-induced permeability changes in living organoids. Proteolytic degradation and altered localization of the tight junction proteins claudin-2, −7, and − 15 was detected using confocal spinning disc microscopy with 3D reconstruction. Hessian analysis was used for quantification of re-localization of claudins. In summary, we provide a novel methodologic approach for quantitative analyses of intestinal epithelial barrier functions in the 3D organoid model.

Abstract: Background
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Previous studies revealed that miR-183-5p is frequently involved in various human cancers. However, the exact role of miR-183-5p in regulating the pathogenesis of lung cancer remains unclear.
Method
Bioinformatic analysis, luciferase reporter assay, and Western blotting was used to investigate whether miR-183-5p directly bound to the 3′UTR of PIK3CA and prevented its translation. Furthermore, an si-miR-183-5p and PIK3CA siRNA was used to evaluate whether PIK3CA expression increased and whether cell proliferation, migration and invasion ability were promoted.
Results
miR-183-5p directly bound to the 3′UTR of PIK3CA and prevented its translation. miR-183-5p also acted as a tumor suppressor, and contrary to most studies, its expression was downregulated in lung cancer. Functional studies revealed that overexpression of miR-183-5p reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and that miR-183-5p induced cell cycle arrest and increased cell apoptosis. PIK3CA expression, cell proliferation, migration and invasion ability increased. siRNA-mediated silencing of PIK3CA in lung cancer cells decreased their proliferation and invasive capabilities, suggesting that miR-183-5p inhibited cell proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells at least partly through downstream targeting of PIK3CA.
Conclusion
Our studies suggest that miR-183-5p may function as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer via the miR-183-5p/PIK3CA regulatory axis and identify a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.

Abstract: With the intensive development of the sheep industry and increasing global temperatures, heat stress in sheep has become an increasingly severe and important issue in recent years. The level of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation changes in response to stress plays important roles in stress responses. However, the role of m6A in the heat stress response of sheep remains unclear. To explore this issue, we measured heat stress protein (HSP) expression, liver function indexes, m6A on RNA, m6A-related enzyme expression, and tissue damage in sheep that had been subjected to heat stress. At the transcriptome level, our results showed significant increases in m6A on RNA and increased mRNA levels of HSPs (HSP70, HSP90, and HSP110) and m6A-related enzymes [METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3), METTL14 (methyltransferase-like 14), WTAP (wilms tumor 1-associated protein), FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein), ALKBH5 (alkB homologue 5), YTHDF1-3 (YTH domain family proteins), and YTHDC1-2 (YTH domain-containing proteins)] following heat stress. At the protein level, the expression of METTL3, YTHDF1-2, and YTHDC2 showed no significant differences following heat stress. However, in contrast to its mRNA level after heat stress, the protein expression of YTHDF3 was reduced, while the expression of HSPs (HSP70, HSP90, and HSP110), METTL14, WTAP, FTO, ALKBH5, YTHDF3, and YTHDC1 increased in line with their measured mRNA levels. Histological experiments revealed that heat stress caused varying degrees of damage to sheep liver tissue. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining indicated that the m6A-related enzymes were expressed in sheep hepatocytes, and differences in expression patterns were observed between the control and heat stress groups. In summary, differences in the level of m6A and the expression of m6A-related enzymes in the liver of sheep were observed after heat stress. This indicates that m6A is involved in the regulation of heat stress in sheep. Our findings provide a new avenue for studying the responses to heat stress in sheep.

Abstract: Background
In patients with thalassemia major, examination routinely used for the evaluation of iron load in Indonesia is serum ferritin, but it is strongly influenced by other factors such as infections, inflammation and vitamin C levels. Evaluation of urinary iron excretion is an important and easy method to indicate iron chelation efficacy.
Objective
To determine the efficacy of iron chelation therapy by urinary iron examination and to evaluate its correlation with the time of transfusion, serum ferritin level, transferrin saturation and T2* MRI.
Methods
Prospective cohort study was conducted in children with thalassemia major aged 7–<18 years old who received DFP therapy. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were examined through inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Patient's serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, peripheral blood, differential count and T2* MRI was documented during the study. Data analysis is based on urine iron level, body iron balance and the correlation between urine iron level, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation and T2* MRI and dosage of DFP.
Results
Thirty (55%) subjects showed a higher urine iron level on the day prior to transfusion (mean: 12,828 SD ±12,801 μg/24 h) in comparison to post transfusion (mean: 10,985 SD ±10,023 μg/24 h). All subjects had positive iron balance (mean 524 SD ±230 mg). There were positive correlation between urine iron level and transferrin saturation (r = 0.559, p = 0.01) and serum ferritin (r = 0.291, p = 0.03), no correlation found with T2* MRI results.
Conclusions
There is a relationship to urinary iron excretion in response to chelation therapy and the degree of iron load.

Abstract: Temperature stress impacts both welfare and productivity of livestock. Global warming is expected to increase the impact, especially in tropical areas. We investigated the biological mechanisms regulated by temperature stress due to the circadian temperature cycle in temperature adapted and non-adapted chicken under tropical conditions. We studied transcriptome profiles of heart, breast muscle, and spleen tissues of Ethiopian lowland chicken adapted to high circadian temperatures and non-adapted Ethiopian highland chicken under lowland conditions at three points during the day: morning, noon, and evening. Functional annotations and network analyses of genes differentially expressed among the time points of the day indicate major differences in the reactions of the tissues to increasing and decreasing temperatures, and also the two chickens lines differ. However, epigenetic changes of chromatin methylation and histone (de)acetylation seemed to be central regulatory mechanisms in all tissues in both chicken lines. Finally, all tissues showed differentially expressed genes between morning and evening times indicating biological mechanisms that need to change during the night to reach morning levels again the next day.

Abstract: While first-line induction therapy for patients with multiple myeloma has changed over the years, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation still plays a significant role, improving both depth of response and progression-free survival of myeloma patients. Our 25-year experience in mobilizing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells for 472 transplant-eligible myeloma patients was retrospectively reviewed. Patients were stratified according to the remission induction therapy received, and the outcomes were compared among the cohorts that received vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone (VAD) (n=232), bortezomib and dexamethasone (BD) (n=86), cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) (n=82) and other regimens (n=67). Cyclophosphamide plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was the predominant mobilization regimen given. A greater number of CD34+ cells (9.9×10E6/kg, p=0.026) was collected with less hospital admissions in BD patients (13%, p=0.001), when compared to those receiving VAD (7.5×10E6/kg, 29%), CyBorD (7.6×10E6/kg, 19%), or other regimens (7.9×10E6/kg, 36%). Induction therapy did not influence the overall rate of unscheduled visits or the length of hospitalization because of complications following mobilization. The myeloma response was not significantly deepened following the cyclophosphamide administered for mobilization. This analysis demonstrates the importance of monitoring the impact of initial treatment on downstream procedures such as stem cell mobilization and collection.

Abstract: FLOTILLIN-1 and FLOTILLIN-2 are membrane rafts associated proteins that have been implicated in insulin and growth factor signaling, endocytosis, cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, cytoskeleton remodeling and membrane trafficking. Furthermore, FLOTILLINs also play important roles in the progression of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the roles of flotillins are investigated in planarian Dugesia japonica. The results show that Djflotillin-1 and Djflotillin-2 play a key role in homeostasis maintenance and regeneration process by regulating the proliferation of the neoblast cells, they are not involved in the maintenance and regeneration of the central nervous system in planarians.

Abstract: Summary
High-throughput targeted lipid profiling with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been used extensively to identify associations between plasma lipid species and disease states. Such methods, used to characterize larger clinical cohorts, often suffer from an inability to differentiate isomeric forms of glycerophospholipids that are typically reported as the sum fatty acid carbons and double bonds. Here we report a chromatography gradient coupled with a detailed characterization of the human plasma lipidome to provide improved resolution and identification of 636 lipid species, including previously unreported species, in a 15-min analysis. We have utilized this method on a subset of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle Study and have detailed associations of plasma lipid species with anthropometric and blood glucose measures. These results highlight the importance and power of high-throughput lipidomics coupled with a detailed characterization of the lipidome to better understand lipid biology in a population setting.

Abstract: Summary
Non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-like enzymes catalyze the non-oxidative homodimerization of aromatic α-keto acids, but the exact reaction mechanism is unknown. The furanone-forming thioesterase domain of the Aspergillus terreus aspulvinone E synthetase MelA displays a predicted quinone-forming motif, whereby its catalytic triad contains an essential cysteine indicating an unusual thioester intermediate. To convert MelA into a quinone-forming atromentin synthetase its thioesterase domain was replaced with that from a Paxillus involutus or A. terreus atromentin synthetase. Phylogenetic proximity of donor and acceptor seems important, as only replacement with the A. terreus thioesterase was functional. Heterologous expression of atromentin synthetases in Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus oryzae revealed host-dependent product formation whereby cross-chemistry directed atromentin biosynthesis in A. niger toward atrofuranic acid. Screening of aspergilli from section Nigri identified an atromentin synthetase in Aspergillus brasiliensis that produced atrofuranic acid in the homologous host. Therefore, cross-chemistry on quinone cores appears common to section Nigri.

Abstract: Lysosomal Ca2+ release channel TRPML1 has been suggested to regulate lysosome size by activating calmodulin (CaM). To further understand how TRPML1 and CaM regulate lysosome size, in this study, we report that inhibiting mTORC1 causes enlarged lysosomes, and the recovery of enlarged lysosomes is suppressed by inhibiting mTORC1. We also show that lysosome vacuolation induced by inhibiting TRPML1 is corrected by mTORC1 upregulation, and the facilitating effect of TRPML1 on the recovery of enlarged lysosomes is suppressed by inhibiting mTORC1. In the meantime, lysosome vacuolation induced by inhibiting CaM is corrected by mTORC1 upregulation, and mTORC1 overexpression corrects the inhibitory effect of CaM antagonist on the recovery of enlarged lysosomes. Conversely, the vacuolation induced by suppressing mTORC1 is not corrected by upregulating CaM. These data suggest that mTORC1 functions downstream of TRPML1 and CaM to regulate lysosome size. Together with our recent finding showing that TRPML1, CaM and mTORC1 form a macromolecular complex to control mTORC1 activity, we suggest that TRPML1 and CaM control lysosome fission through regulating mTORC1, identifying an mTORC1-dependent molecular mechanism for lysosomal membrane fission.

Abstract: Summary
Crohn’s disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease influenced by bacteria. Adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) is associated with CD, yet the adaptations facilitating AIEC gut colonization are unknown. AIEC isolates exhibit high genetic diversity, suggesting strains evolve independently across different gut environments. We tracked the adaptive evolution of AIEC in a murine model of chronic colonization across multiple hosts and transmission events. We detected evolved lineages that outcompeted the ancestral strain in the host through independent mechanisms. One lineage was hypermotile because of a mobile insertion sequence upstream of the master flagellar regulator, flhDC, which enhanced AIEC invasion and establishment of a mucosal niche. Another lineage outcompeted the ancestral strain through improved use of acetate, a short-chain fatty acid in the gut. The presence of hypermotile and acetate-consuming lineages discriminated E. coli isolated from CD patients from healthy controls, suggesting an evolutionary trajectory that distinguishes AIEC from commensal E. coli.

Abstract: Summary
Palmitoylation is a post-translational modification involving the thioesterification of cysteine residues with a 16-carbon-saturated fatty acid. Little is known about rates of depalmitoylation or the parameters that dictate these rates. Here we report a modular strategy to synthesize quenched fluorogenic substrates for the specific detection of depalmitoylase activity and for mapping the substrate specificity of individual depalmitoylases. We demonstrate that human depalmitoylases APT1 and APT2, and TgPPT1 from the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, have distinct specificities that depend on amino acid residues distal to the palmitoyl cysteine. This information informs the design of optimal and non-optimal substrates as well as isoform-selective substrates to detect the activity of a specific depalmitoylase in complex proteomes. In addition to providing tools for studying depalmitoylases, our findings identify a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulating steady-state levels of distinct palmitoylation sites by sequence-dependent control of depalmitoylation rates.

Abstract: Beta thalassemia major (β-TM) displays a great deal of phenotypic heterogeneity, not fully investigated in terms of cause-effect. We aimed to detect if different genotypic groups could be related to different levels of cardiac impairment, evaluated by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). We considered 671 β-TM patients (age 30.1 years, 52.9% females) consecutively enrolled in the Myocardial Iron Overload (MIO) in Thalassemia network. MIO was assessed by T2* technique. Biventricular function was quantified by cine images. Myocardial fibrosis was evaluated by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) technique. Three groups of patients were identified: heterozygotes β+/β° (N = 279), homozygotes β + (N = 154), homozygotes β° (N = 238). Transfusional needs resulted significantly lower in homozygous β + TM patients when compared to the other groups. The homozygous β + group versus the heterozygous and homozygous β° groups showed higher global heart T2* values (P < 0.0001) and a lower number of patients with a global heart T2* value<20 ms (P < 0.001). The homozygotes β + showed a lower number of patients with a pathological left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than the other two groups (P < 0.05).

Abstract: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is often accompanied by a potentially devastating coagulopathy. Predictors of thrombohemorrhagic early death (TH-ED)/early bleeding death are not well characterized. In this retrospective study, eleven baseline clinical variables that can be assessed easily and promptly were chosen for evaluation in a cohort of 364 patients with APL who were administered arsenic trioxide (ATO) alone as remission induction therapy. TH-ED was defined as death from bleeding or thrombosis within 30 days after hospital admission. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for both the univariate and multivariate analyses. Totally, 53 patients died from severe bleeding (51 cases) or thrombosis (2 cases), and at 30 days the cumulative incidences of TH-ED were 14.6%. Six independent risk factors for TH-ED were identified, including relapse, male, white blood cell (WBC) count above 10 × 109/L, fibrinogen level below 1 g/L, D-dimer level above 4 mg/L and increased creatinine level. Increased creatinine level was the most powerful risk factor, followed by WBC count > 10 × 109/L. This study identified risk factors for TH-ED in a large cohort of patients with APL, which enriched clinical information on identifying patients at high risk of TH-ED.

Abstract: Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is one of 13 members of the human equilibrative glucose transport protein family and the only glucose transporter thought to be expressed in human erythrocyte membranes. Although GLUT1 has been shown to be anchored to adducin at the junctional spectrin-actin complex of the membrane through interactions with multiple proteins, whether other populations of GLUT1 also exist in the human erythrocyte membrane has not been examined. Because GLUT1 plays such a critical role in erythrocyte biology and since it comprises 10% of the total membrane protein, we undertook to evaluate the subpopulations of erythrocyte GLUT1 using single particle tracking. By monitoring the diffusion of individual AlexaFluor 488-labeled GLUT1 molecules on the surfaces of intact erythrocytes, we are able to identify three distinct subpopulations of GLUT1. While the mobility of the major subpopulation is similar to that of the anion transporter, band 3, both a more mobile and more anchored subpopulation also exist. From these studies, we conclude that ~65% of GLUT1 resides in similar or perhaps the same protein complex as band 3, while the remaining 1/3rd are either freely diffusing or interacting with other cytoskeletally anchored membrane protein complexes.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common form of hematological malignancies, the discovery of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) plays an important role in diverse biological processes including hematopoietic differentiation and proliferation. However, the interaction mechanism of key RNAs and their regulatory network in childhood AML are still to be elucidated. RNA profiles were downloaded from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatment (TARGET) database and identified specific lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in high-risk group of childhood AML. A lncRNA-mRNA-miRNA ceRNA network in childhood AML was constructed. A total of 2064 mRNAs, 615 lncRNAs, and 60 miRNAs were identified as significantly differentially expressed, and 13 lncRNAs, 7 miRNAs, and 67 mRNAs were incorporated in the ceRNA network. Functional analysis showed that these DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in Ras signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and other tumor-related pathways. Among the network, 10 RNAs (LINC00471, hsa-mir-100, hsa-mir-150, ANP32E, ERMP1, MYO1B, PAPD7, PTGIS, TERF1, and VEGFA) was associated with high-risk group of childhood AML and functions were significant for prognosis. Then, these findings together provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of high-risk group of childhood AML that can assist clinicians clarify the function of lncRNA to guide the treatment and in-depth study.

Abstract: The genetic mechanisms underlying the cattle resilience to severe cold temperatures are still unknown. In this study, we observed that four blood biochemical parameters were significantly altered, i.e., blood adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and potassium (K+) after expose to − 32°C for 3 h. This was observed using 105 healthy Sanhe heifers with similar weight (398.17±34.06 kg) and age (19.30±4.91 months). A total of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in 5′-flanking region of the hsp70 gene in Sanhe cattle, while only 10 SNPs were segregating when comparing genetic variations between Sanhe cattle and 285 Chinese Holstein samples. Statistically significant associations between the genomic markers SNP-42−, SNP-105+, SNP-181+, and SNP-205+ with blood T3 and between SNP-105+ and blood T4 were observed by applying the general linear model procedure and Bonferroni t test. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the T alleles of SNP-42− and SNP-205+ in the GC box and Kozak sequence of the hsp70 gene, respectively, significantly decreased the green fluorescent proteins activity in vitro GFP reporter assays. These findings suggest that these two SNPs are causative polymorphisms involved in the regulation of hsp70 promoter activity and might contribute to the observed association between the hsp70 gene and T3 and T4 levels in Sanhe cattle. Thus, hsp70 gene is a promising candidate gene to be validated in independent cattle populations and functional studies related to cold stress resilience in cattle.

Abstract: Chondrocyte apoptosis is closely related to the development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA); however, the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Previous studies have confirmed that cell apoptosis is one of the main pathological alterations during oxidative stress, and chondrocyte apoptosis induced by oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of OA. Rat chondrocytes exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were used as the experimental oxidative stress model. We assessed cell viability, cell apoptosis, levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) production, gene relative expression level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and expressions of iNOS, PI3K, phospho-Akt, caspase-9, and caspase-3. With the rising of intracellular ROS and increasing iNOS synthesis, producing a large amount of NO in chondrocytes, H2O2 decreased the cell viability and induced cell apoptosis of chondrocytes. Furthermore, the levels of caspase-9 and caspase-3 protein expression were significantly elevated as well as the level of p-Akt protein expression when induced by oxidative stress. These findings suggest that oxidative stress-induced chondrocyte apoptosis occurred via activating both PI3K/Akt and caspase pathways in the early stage in these processes.

Abstract: Summary
Cisplatin is classically known to exhibit anticancer activity through DNA damage in the nucleus. Here we found a mechanism by which cisplatin affects iron metabolism, leading to toxicity and cell death. Cisplatin causes intracellular iron deficiency through direct inhibition of the master regulator of iron metabolism, iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) with marginal effects on IRP1. Cisplatin, but not carboplatin or transplatin, binds human IRP2 at Cys512 and Cys516 and impairs IRP2 binding to iron-responsive elements of ferritin and transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) mRNAs. IRP2 inhibition by cisplatin caused ferritin upregulation and TfR1 downregulation leading to sustained intracellular iron deficiency. Cys512/516Ala mutant IRP2 made cells more resistant to cisplatin. Furthermore, combination of cisplatin and the iron chelator desferrioxamine enhanced cytotoxicity through augmented iron depletion in culture and xenograft mouse model. Collectively, cisplatin is an inhibitor of IRP2 that induces intracellular iron deficiency.

Abstract: Type I natural killer T (NKT) cells are attractive candidates for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, we examined the characteristics of type I NKT cells in patients with adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We first identified type I NKT cells as Vα24-Jα18 and Vβ11 double-positive CD3+ lymphocytes. Using this method, we found that the adult B-cell ALL patients presented significantly lower level of type I NKT cells than the age- and sex-matching control subjects. The expression of IL-21 by type I NKT cells was then examined using intracellular flow cytometry, which showed that with α-GalCer stimulation, the adult B-cell ALL patients presented significantly lower level of IL-21+ type I NKT cells than control subjects. By both flow cytometry and ELISA, we found that the vast majority of IL-21-expressing type I NKT cells expressed IL-21R, which was also reduced in adult B-cell ALL patients. Using an in vitro co-culture system, we demonstrated that IL-21R+, but not IL-21R-, type I NKT cells could promote the IFN-γ, granzyme B, and perforin expression by CD8 T cells in an IL-21-dependent fashion. This type I NKT cell-mediated stimulatory effect was reduced in adult B-cell ALL patients than in control subjects. In addition, we observed a positive correlation between the frequency of IL-21R+ type I NKT cells and the frequencies of IFN-γ-, granzyme B-, and perforin-expressing circulating CD8 T cells in adult B-cell ALL patients directly ex vivo. Overall, this study identified an IL-21-related impairment in type I NKT cells from adult B-cell ALL patients.

Abstract: We investigated the changes in chromosomal abnormalities in myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients during long-term follow-up. In total, 28 MPN patients (22 with primary myelofibrosis and 6 with polycythemia vera) were included. Among them, 25 patients underwent serial bone marrow (BM) biopsies during disease progression, and 3 patients had cytogenetic abnormalities at initial diagnosis but lacked follow-up BM biopsies. JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation analyses were performed. Targeted sequencing analysis was conducted in 11 patients. Among the 28 patients, 21 (75.0%) had cytogenetic abnormalities either at diagnosis (8/26) or during follow-up. The median time from the initial analysis to the appearance of additional cytogenetic abnormalities was 8.4 years. Among the chromosomal abnormalities at initial diagnosis, trisomy 8 (3/26, 11.5%) was the most frequent, followed by gain of 1q, del(20q), and del(9q) (each in 2/26). Among all chromosomal abnormalities, including those that occurred during follow-up, the most frequent was del(20q) and +1q (8/28, 28.6%), followed by del(6p) (14.3%) and trisomy 8 (10.7%). Del(20q) was more frequent in CALR-mutated patients (4/6, 66.7%) than in JAK2-mutated patients (3/19, 15.8%, P = 0.016). The presence of cytogenetic abnormalities at initial diagnosis was associated with poor prognosis. Cytogenetic evolution may provide interesting insights into the disease course.

Abstract: Complement factor H (FH) and FH-related proteins (FHRs), structurally similar proteins are involved in the regulation of complement activation. Homozygous deletion of FHR 1 and 3 proteins (FHR1/3−/−) is known as a risk factor for disorders such as aHUS and SLE, characterised by thrombo-inflammatory complications. Interestingly, FHR1/3−/− genotype also exists as polymorphism in healthy population of various ethnicities around the world including 8–10% Indians. In an effort to understand the functional role of this polymorphism, we describe in this study an elevated surface-bound FH on platelets and monocytes, but not other blood cells in FHR1/3 −/− healthy individuals. The FHR1/3−/− platelets displayed diminish ability to form aggregates in response to agonists in vitro. The FHR1/3−/− monocytes displayed elevated secretion of TNFα, IL1β, IL6 and IL10 in response to TLR ligands. However, exogenous FH limits platelet aggregates formation as well as cytokine secretion in monocytes. Therefore, observations together suggest a differential regulation of platelets and monocytes by FH-FHR1/3 axis in healthy individuals. While these findings will need more detailed investigation, it is clear that the connection between FH-FHR axis and thrombo-inflammatory complications is likely to be complex in diseases including aHUS and SLE, and provide interesting new directions for future study.

Abstract: Hexokinase 1 and 2 have been shown to inhibit Bak- and Bax-mediated apoptosis, leading us to combine the histone deacetylase inhibitor romidepsin with clotrimazole or bifonazole, two compounds that reportedly decrease mitochondrial localization of hexokinases. Cancer cell lines derived from breast, kidney, lung, colon or ovarian cancers were treated with a short-term exposure to 25 ng/ml romidepsin combined with either clotrimazole or bifonazole. The combination of romidepsin with 25 µM clotrimazole or bifonazole resulted in increased annexin staining compared to cells treated with any of the drugs alone. Cell death was caspase-mediated, as the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh was found to inhibit apoptosis induced by the combination. A549 lung cancer cells or HCT-116 cells deficient in Bak and Bax were also resistant to apoptosis with the combination implicating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. We found that a 24 h treatment with clotrimazole or bifonazole decreased total hexokinase 2 expression, resulting in a 76% or 60% decrease, respectively, of mitochondrial expression of hexokinase 2. Mitochondrial hexokinase 1 levels increased 2-fold or less. Our work suggests that the combination of a short-term romidepsin treatment with bifonazole or clotrimazole leads to increased apoptosis, most likely due to decreased mitochondrial expression of hexokinase 2.

Abstract: Cisplatin-resistant (A549CisR and H292CisR) and radioresistant (A549R26 and H292R22) sub-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells were developed in our lab by long term treatment of parental cells with cisplatin or radiation. Our data showed no cross-resistance between these two sets of cell lines, indicating that molecular mechanisms of developing each resistance may be different. Using these sub-line cells, we sought to reveal the most significantly up-regulated molecules in cisplatin-resistant and radioresistant lung cancer cells, compared with parental cells. In qPCR analyses of screening DNA repair and cell survival-associated molecules, we identified NFκB and TNFα as the most significantly up-regulated molecules in cisplatin-resistant and radioresistant lung cancer cells, respectively, compared with parental cells. Western blot analysis of parental vs. resistant cells and the IHC staining of tumor tissues of A549P, A549CisR, and A549R26 cell-derived xenografts in mice confirmed such results. Next, studies using specific inhibitors of NFκB and TNFα and experiments using NFκB and TNFα-knocked down cells showed that inhibition or knockdown of NFκB overcame cisplatin-resistance, while inhibition or knockdown of TNFα increased radiosensitivity of radioresistant lung cancer cells. Therefore, these two molecules may be used as markers of the prognosis/diagnosis of individual resistance development during lung cancer treatment.

Abstract: Pharmacologic induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is an effective strategy for treating sickle cell disease (SCD) by ameliorating disease severity. Hydroxyurea is the only FDA-approved agent that induces HbF, but significant non-responders and requirement for frequent monitoring of blood counts for drug toxicity limit clinical usefulness. Therefore, we investigated a novel prodrug conjugate of butyric acid (BA) and δ-aminolevulinate (ALA) as a potential HbF inducing agent, using erythroid precursors and a preclinical β-YAC mouse model. We observed significantly increased γ-globin gene transcription and HbF expression mediated by AN-233 in K562 cells. Moreover, AN-233 stimulated mild heme biosynthesis and inhibited expression of heme-regulated eIF2α kinase involved in silencing γ-globin expression. Studies using primary erythroid precursors generated from sickle peripheral blood mononuclear cells verified the ability of AN-233 to induce HbF, increase histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels at the γ-globin promoter and reduce erythroid precursor sickling by 50%. Subsequent drug treatment of β-YAC transgenic mice confirmed HbF induction in vivo by AN-233 through an increase in the percentage of HbF positive red blood cells and HbF levels measured by flow cytometry. These data support the potential development of AN-233 for the treatment of SCD.

Abstract: Introduction
The serological screening of blood donors has been instituted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and is mandatory in the research on several diseases transmissible through blood transfusion. Blood banks need to establish a screening service capable of reducing associated transfusions risks.
Objective
The objective of this study was to establish the prevalence of transfusion-transmissible infection markers in donors at a hemotherapy service located in southwest Bahia, Brazil.
Methods
A retrospective study was performed between 2010 and 2016. Variables, such as the characterization of donors who were suitable and unsuitable for donation (in clinical screening), stratification by gender and age group and unsuitable samples for reactive test results (in serological screening) by aspecific antibodies against hepatitis B virus (anti-HBc and HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), human T-lymphotropic virus (anti-HTLV I/II), HIV virus (anti-HIV I/II), chagas disease, and syphilis markers, were evaluated.
Results
Collected data showed that 3.13% of the donors were considered unsuitable for serological screening and that the prevalence of reactive test results was higher in donors aged between 30 and 39 years and in males. The means of the serological markers was 1.09% for syphilis reagents, 0.63% for anti-HIV I/II, 0.51% for anti-HBc and anti-HCV, 0.15% for HBsAg, 0.14% for HTLV I/II and 0.10% for Chagas disease.
Conclusion
These results reflect the importance of awareness campaigns on sexually transmitted diseases and transfusion safety measures taken by hemotherapy services.

Abstract: Summary
The cerebral cortex has expanded in size and complexity in primates, yet the molecular innovations that enabled primate-specific brain attributes remain obscure. We generated cerebral cortex organoids from human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus pluripotent stem cells and sequenced their transcriptomes at weekly time points for comparative analysis. We used transcript structure and expression conservation to discover gene regulatory long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Of 2,975 human, multi-exonic lncRNAs, 2,472 were structurally conserved in at least one other species and 920 were conserved in all. Three hundred eighty-six human lncRNAs were transiently expressed (TrEx) and many were also TrEx in great apes (46%) and rhesus (31%). Many TrEx lncRNAs are expressed in specific cell types by single-cell RNA sequencing. Four TrEx lncRNAs selected based on cell-type specificity, gene structure, and expression pattern conservation were ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells by CRISPRa. All induced trans gene expression changes were consistent with neural gene regulatory activity.

Abstract: Summary
It is generally considered that mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation into blood cells in vitro recapitulates yolk sac (YS) hematopoiesis. As such, similar to YS-derived B-progenitors, we demonstrate here that ESC-derived B-progenitors differentiate into B-1 and marginal zone B cells, but not B-2 cells in immunodeficient mice after transplantation. ESC-derived B-1 cells were maintained in the recipients for more than 6 months, secreting natural IgM antibodies in vivo. Gene expression profiling displayed a close relationship between ESC- and YS-derived B-1 progenitors. Because there are no hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) detectable in our ESC differentiation culture, successful long-term engraftment of ESC-derived functional B-1 cells supports the presence of HSC-independent B-1 cell development.

However, it is poorly understood how NMII isoforms contribute to cytokinesis in mammalian cells. Here, we investigated the roles of the two major NMII isoforms, NMIIA and NMIIB, in cytokinesis using a WI-38 VA13 cell line (human immortalized fibroblast). In this cell line, NMIIB tended to localize to the contractile ring more than NMIIA. The expression level of NMIIA affected the localization of NMIIB. Most NMIIB accumulated at the cleavage furrow in NMIIA-knockout (KO) cells, and most NMIIA was displaced from this location in exogenous NMIIB-expressing cells, indicating that NMIIB preferentially localizes to the contractile ring. Specific KO of each isoform elicited opposite effects. The rate of furrow ingression was decreased and increased in NMIIA-KO and NMIIB-KO cells, respectively. Meanwhile, the length of NMII-filament stacks in the contractile ring was increased and decreased in NMIIA-KO and NMIIB-KO cells, respectively. Moreover, NMIIA helped to maintain cortical stiffness during cytokinesis. These findings suggest that appropriate ratio of NMIIA and NMIIB in the contractile ring is important for proper cytokinesis in specific cell types. In addition, two-photon excitation spinning-disk confocal microscopy enabled us to image constriction of the contractile ring in live cells in a three-dimensional manner.

Abstract: Summary
Small-molecule chemotypes with unexpected bioactivity may be identified by combining strategies built on the biological relevance of, e.g., natural products (NPs), such as biology-oriented synthesis, with principles that enable efficient coverage of chemical space, such as fragment-based compound design. Evaluation in target-agnostic phenotypic assays and target identification may link biologically relevant chemotypes to unexpected and unknown targets. We describe the phenotypic identification of an unprecedented kinase inhibitor chemotype obtained by synthetic combination of two biosynthetically unrelated NP fragment types. Target identification and biological characterization revealed that the inhibitor, termed Myokinasib, impairs cytokinesis, induces formation of multinucleated cells, and reduces phosphorylated myosin II light chain abundance on stress fibers by selective inhibition of myosin light chain kinase 1.

Abstract: Beta-thalassemia-related anemia and chronic hypercoagulative state are supposed to cause cumulative cerebrovascular damage with consequent parenchymal/vascular changes and functional impairment. However, recent conventional MRI/MR-angiography investigations failed to show an increased cerebrovascular involvement in beta-thalassemia patients managed according to current treatment guidelines, in spite of significantly decreased full-scale IQ scores. We therefore investigated those patients and controls by means of advanced quantitative MRI analyses (based on magnetization transfer and diffusion tensor imaging) searching for signs of possible cerebrovascular injuries undetected by conventional MRI/MR-angiography. The 3 T-MRI study protocol included diffusion tensor imaging and 3D-multi-echo FLASH sequences for magnetization transfer analysis. Whole-brain voxel-based analyses showed that magnetization transfer, fractional anisotropy, and mean, radial and axial diffusivity do not differ between healthy controls and beta-thalassemia patients (considered as a whole group or as distinct transfusion dependent and non-transfusion dependent subgroups). No correlation emerged between all the considered MRI metrics and cognitive findings (full-scale IQ) or the main clinical and laboratory data. According to our findings, adult neurologically-asymptomatic beta-thalassemia patients (regardless of clinical severity) do not seem to present an increased disease-related cerebrovascular vulnerability compared to healthy controls downsizing the need of regular brain MRI monitoring, at least when the current treatment guidelines are followed.

Abstract: Summary
Resolution of acute inflammation is governed, in part, by specialized pro-resolving mediators, including lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins. Among them, resolvin D1 (RvD1) exhibits potent pro-resolving functions via activating human resolvin D1 receptor (DRV1/GPR32). RvD1 is a complex molecule that requires challenging organic synthesis, diminishing its potential as a therapeutic. Therefore, we implemented a high-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries and identified several chemotypes that activated recombinant DRV1, represented by NCGC00120943 (C1A), NCGC00135472 (C2A), pMPPF, and pMPPI. These chemotypes also elicited rapid impedance changes in cells overexpressing recombinant DRV1. With human macrophages, they each stimulated phagocytosis of serum-treated zymosan at concentrations comparable with that of RvD1, the endogenous DRV1 ligand. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis of live E. coli was significantly increased by these chemotypes in DRV1-transfected macrophages, compared with mock-transfected cells. Taken together, these chemotypes identified by unbiased screens act as RvD1 mimetics, exhibiting pro-resolving functions via interacting with human DRV1.

Abstract: Expression of the metastasis suppressor NME1 in melanoma is associated with reduced cellular motility, invasion, and metastasis, but mechanisms underlying these activities are not completely understood. Herein we report a novel mechanism through which NME1 drives formation of large, stable focal adhesions (FAs) in melanoma cells via induction of integrin β3 (ITGβ3), and in one cell line, concomitant suppression of integrin β1 (ITGβ1) transcripts. Forced expression of NME1 resulted in a strong activation of the promoter region (−301 to +13) of the ITGB3 gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed the transcriptional induction was associated with direct recruitment of NME1 and an increase in the epigenetic activation mark, acetylation of histone 3 on lysine 27 (H3K27Ac) to a 1 kb stretch of 5'-flanking sequence of the ITGB3 gene. Unexpectedly, NME1 did not affect the amount either ITGβ1 or ITGβ3 proteins were internalized and recycled, processes commonly associated with regulating expression of integrins at the cell surface. The ability of NME1 to suppress motile and invasive phenotypes of melanoma cells was dependent on its induction of ITGβ3. Expression of ITGβ3 mRNA was associated with increased disease-free survival time in melanoma patients of the TCGA collection, consistent with its potential role as an effector of the metastasis suppressor function of NME1. Together, these data indicate metastasis suppressor activity of NME1 in melanoma is mediated by induction of ITGB3 gene transcription, with NME1-driven enrichment of ITGβ3 protein at the cell membrane resulting in attenuated cell motility through the stabilization of large focal adhesions.

Abstract: Summary
Diabetes is a hyperglycemic condition characterized by pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and depletion. Whereas methods for monitoring β-cell function in vivo exist, methods to deliver therapeutics to β cells are lacking. We leveraged the rare ability of β cells to concentrate zinc to preferentially trap zinc-binding molecules within β cells, resulting in β-cell-targeted compound delivery. We determined that zinc-rich β cells and islets preferentially accumulated TSQ (6-methoxy-8-p-toluenesulfonamido-quinoline) in a zinc-dependent manner compared with exocrine pancreas. Next, we asked whether appending a zinc-chelating moiety onto a β-cell replication-inducing compound was sufficient to confer preferential β-cell accumulation and activity. Indeed, the hybrid compound preferentially accumulated within rodent and human islets in a zinc-dependent manner and increased the selectivity of replication-promoting activity toward β cells. These data resolve the fundamental question of whether intracellular accumulation of zinc-chelating compounds is influenced by zinc content. Furthermore, application of this principle yielded a proof-of-concept method for β-cell-targeted drug delivery and bioactivity.

Abstract: Emergence of drug-resistant mutations in the course of myeloma cell evolution and subsequent relapse of myeloma appears to be currently inevitable in most patients. To remedy this situation, we are trying to develop therapeutic small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) based on tRNase ZL-utilizing efficacious gene silencing (TRUE gene silencing), an RNA-mediated gene expression control technology. We designed two sets of double heptamer-type sgRNA, which target the human BCL2 mRNA. Both sets of double heptamer-type sgRNA reduced viability of human myeloma cell lines, RPMI-8226 and KMM-1. We also performed a mouse xenograft experiment to examine how the double heptamer-type sgRNA DHa1(BCL2)/DHa2(BCL2) can reduce the growth of KMM-1 cells in vivo. Median survival periods of the sgRNA cohorts were greater than that of the control cohort by 11–43 days. Furthermore, we designed two sets of double heptamer-type sgRNA, which target the human CCND1 mRNA, and both sets synergistically reduced RPMI-8226 cell viability.

Abstract: Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is involved in a variety of biological processes in different cell types and disease conditions, including myogenesis. However, the specific function of CARM1 in skeletal muscle wasting under pathologic conditions remains unclear. Here, we identify CARM1 as a novel participant in muscular atrophy. Increases in CARM1 protein levels correlated positively with the loss of muscle mass upon denervation in mice. Notably, the knockdown of CARM1 represses the progression of muscle wasting and the expression of the atrophy-related genes Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 in vivo and in vitro. With respect to the underlying mechanism, we show that CARM1 interacts with and asymmetrically dimethylates FoxO3 (a specific transcription factor that controls atrophy-related gene expression). This methylation modification by CARM1 is required for FoxO3-dependent transcription. Accordingly, a CARM1 methyltransferase inhibitor also restrains the expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 and myotube atrophy. Furthermore, CARM1 knockdown induces a remarkable myofiber autophagic deficit during the atrophy process. Altogether, our study identifies a crucial regulator of skeletal muscle atrophy and suggests that CARM1 is a potential target for the prevention of muscle atrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx) systems function independently of the rest of the cell. While maintenance of mitochondrial thiol redox state is thought vital for cell survival, this was not testable due to the difficulty of manipulating the organelle's thiol systems independently of those in other cell compartments. To overcome this constraint we modified the glutathione S-transferase substrate and Trx reductase (TrxR) inhibitor, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) by conjugation to the mitochondria-targeting triphenylphosphonium cation. The result, MitoCDNB, is taken up by mitochondria where it selectively depletes the mitochondrial GSH pool, catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases, and directly inhibits mitochondrial TrxR2 and peroxiredoxin 3, a peroxidase. Importantly, MitoCDNB inactivates mitochondrial thiol redox homeostasis in isolated cells and in vivo, without affecting that of the cytosol. Consequently, MitoCDNB enables assessment of the biomedical importance of mitochondrial thiol homeostasis in reactive oxygen species production, organelle dynamics, redox signaling, and cell death in cells and in vivo.
