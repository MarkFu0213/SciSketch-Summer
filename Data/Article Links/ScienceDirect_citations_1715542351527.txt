Abstract: Summary
The form and synaptic fine structure of melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells, also called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), were determined using a new membrane-targeted version of a genetic probe for correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM). ipRGCs project to multiple brain regions, and because the method labels the entire neuron, it was possible to analyze nerve terminals in multiple retinorecipient brain regions, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), and subregions of the lateral geniculate. Although ipRGCs provide the only direct retinal input to the OPN and SCN, ipRGC terminal arbors and boutons were found to be remarkably different in each target region. A network of dendro-dendritic chemical synapses (DDCSs) was also revealed in the SCN, with ipRGC axon terminals preferentially synapsing on the DDCS-linked cells. The methods developed to enable this analysis should propel other CLEM studies of long-distance brain circuits at high resolution.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. While several pathogenic mutations have been identified, the vast majority of ALS cases have no family history of disease. Thus, for most ALS cases, the disease may be a product of multiple pathways contributing to varying degrees in each patient. Using machine learning algorithms, we stratify the transcriptomes of 148 ALS postmortem cortex samples into three distinct molecular subtypes. The largest cluster, identified in 61% of patient samples, displays hallmarks of oxidative and proteotoxic stress. Another 19% of the samples shows predominant signatures of glial activation. Finally, a third group (20%) exhibits high levels of retrotransposon expression and signatures of TARDBP/TDP-43 dysfunction. We further demonstrate that TDP-43 (1) directly binds a subset of retrotransposon transcripts and contributes to their silencing in vitro, and (2) pathological TDP-43 aggregation correlates with retrotransposon de-silencing in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is critical for the development, maintenance, and function of plasma cells. The mechanism by which IRF4 exerts its action in mature plasma cells has been elusive due to the death of all such cells upon IRF4 loss. While we identify apoptosis as a critical pathway for the death of plasma cells caused by IRF4 loss, we also determine that IRF4 did not regulate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway directly. By using an inducible IRF4 deletion system in the presence of the overexpression of anti-apoptotic BCL2, we identify genes whose expression is coordinated by IRF4 and that in turn specify plasma cell identity and mitochondrial homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Misregulation of alternative splicing is a hallmark of human tumors, yet to what extent and how it contributes to malignancy are only beginning to be unraveled. Here, we define which members of the splicing factor SR and SR-like families contribute to breast cancer and uncover differences and redundancies in their targets and biological functions. We identify splicing factors frequently altered in human breast tumors and assay their oncogenic functions using breast organoid models. We demonstrate that not all splicing factors affect mammary tumorigenesis in MCF-10A cells. Specifically, the upregulation of SRSF4, SRSF6, or TRA2β disrupts acinar morphogenesis and promotes cell proliferation and invasion in MCF-10A cells. By characterizing the targets of these oncogenic splicing factors, we identify shared spliced isoforms associated with well-established cancer hallmarks. Finally, we demonstrate that TRA2β is regulated by the MYC oncogene, plays a role in metastasis maintenance in vivo, and its levels correlate with breast cancer patient survival.

Abstract: Summary
PD-L1 and PD-L2 are important targets for immune checkpoint blockade, but how tumor cells achieve their expression remains to be addressed. Here, we find that PD-L1 and PD-L2 are co-expressed in cancer cell lines and tissues across different cancer types. In breast cancer, MDA-MB-231 and SUM-159 cells show high expression of both PD-L1 and PD-L2. The expression of both PD-L1 and PD-L2 is greatly reduced upon treatment of inhibitors of super-enhancers. Bioinformatic analysis identifies a potential super-enhancer (PD-L1L2-SE) that is located between the CD274 and CD273 genes. Genetic deletion of PD-L1L2-SE profoundly reduces the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2. PD-L1L2-SE-deficient cancer cells fail to generate immune evasion and are sensitive to T cell-mediated killing. Notably, epigenetic activation of such a region (PD-L1L2-SE) is correlated with PD-L1 and PD-L2. Taken together, we identify a super-enhancer (PD-L1L2-SE) that is responsible for the overexpression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 as well as immune evasion in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Control of transcription speed, which influences many co-transcriptional processes, is poorly understood. We report that PNUTS-PP1 phosphatase is a negative regulator of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation rate. The PNUTS W401A mutation, which disrupts PP1 binding, causes genome-wide acceleration of transcription associated with hyper-phosphorylation of the Spt5 elongation factor. Immediately downstream of poly(A) sites, Pol II decelerates from >2 kb/min to <1 kb/min, which correlates with Spt5 dephosphorylation. Pol II deceleration and Spt5 dephosphorylation require poly(A) site recognition and the PNUTS-PP1 complex, which is in turn necessary for transcription termination. These results lead to a model for termination, the “sitting duck torpedo” mechanism, where poly(A) site-dependent deceleration caused by PNUTS-PP1 and Spt5 dephosphorylation is required to convert Pol II into a viable target for the Xrn2 terminator exonuclease. Spt5 and its bacterial homolog NusG therefore have related functions controlling kinetic competition between RNA polymerases and the termination factors that pursue them.

Abstract: Summary
During postnatal development, cerebellar climbing fibers alter their innervation strengths onto supernumerary Purkinje cell targets, generating a one-to-few connectivity pattern in adulthood. To get insight about the processes responsible for this remapping, we reconstructed serial electron microscopy datasets from mice during the first postnatal week. Between days 3 and 7, individual climbing fibers selectively add many synapses onto a subset of Purkinje targets in a positive-feedback manner, without pruning synapses from other targets. Active zone sizes of synapses associated with powerful versus weak inputs are indistinguishable. Changes in synapse number are thus the predominant form of early developmental plasticity. Finally, the numbers of climbing fibers and Purkinje cells in a local region nearly match. Initial over-innervation of Purkinje cells by climbing fibers is therefore economical: the number of axons entering a region is enough to assure that each ultimately retains a postsynaptic target and that none branched there in vain.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that sense pathogen- and host-derived factors, including single-stranded RNA. In the brain, let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family members are abundantly expressed, and some have recently been shown to serve as TLR7 ligands. We investigated whether let-7 miRNA family members differentially control microglia biology in health and disease. We found that a subset of let-7 miRNA family members function as signaling molecules to induce microglial release of inflammatory cytokines, modulate antigen presentation, and attenuate cell migration in a TLR7-dependent manner. The capability of the let-7 miRNAs to control microglial function is sequence specific, mapping to a let-7 UUGU motif. In human and murine glioblastoma/glioma, let-7 miRNAs are differentially expressed and reduce murine GL261 glioma growth in the same sequence-specific fashion through microglial TLR7. Taken together, these data establish let-7 miRNAs as key TLR7 signaling activators that serve to regulate the diverse functions of microglia in health and glioma.

Abstract: Summary
Although it is established that fatty acid (FA) synthesis supports anabolic growth in cancer, the role of exogenous FA uptake remains elusive. Here we show that, during acquisition of resistance to HER2 inhibition, metabolic rewiring of breast cancer cells favors reliance on exogenous FA uptake over de novo FA synthesis. Through cDNA microarray analysis, we identify the FA transporter CD36 as a critical gene upregulated in cells with acquired resistance to the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib. Accordingly, resistant cells exhibit increased exogenous FA uptake and metabolic plasticity. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of CD36 suppresses the growth of lapatinib-resistant but not lapatinib-sensitive cells in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of Cd36 in mammary tissues of MMTV-neu mice significantly attenuates tumorigenesis. In breast cancer patients, CD36 expression increases following anti-HER2 therapy, which correlates with a poor prognosis. Our results define CD36-mediated metabolic rewiring as an essential survival mechanism in HER2-positive breast cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are sensor cells with diverse immune functions, from type I interferon (IFN-I) production to antigen presentation, T cell activation, and tolerance. Regulation of these functions remains poorly understood but could be mediated by functionally specialized pDC subpopulations. We address pDC diversity using a high-dimensional single-cell approach: mass cytometry (CyTOF). Our analysis uncovers a murine pDC-like population that specializes in antigen presentation with limited capacity for IFN-I production. Using a multifaceted cross-species comparison, we show that this pDC-like population is the definitive murine equivalent of the recently described human AXL+ DCs, which we unify under the name transitional DCs (tDCs) given their continuum of pDC and cDC2 characteristics. tDCs share developmental traits with pDCs, as well as recruitment dynamics during viral infection. Altogether, we provide a framework for deciphering the function of pDCs and tDCs during diseases, which has the potential to open new avenues for therapeutic design.

Abstract: Summary
To systematically explore the genes mediating functional crosstalk between metazoan biological processes, we apply comparative genetic interaction (GI) mapping in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans to generate an inter-bioprocess network consisting of 178 C. elegans GIs. The GI network spans six annotated biological processes including aging, intracellular transport, microtubule-based processes, cytokinesis, lipid metabolic processes, and anatomical structure development. By proposing a strategy called “reciprocal functional test” for interacting gene pairs, we discover a group of genes that mediate crosstalk between distinct biological processes. In particular, we identify the ribosomal S6 Kinase/RSKS-1, previously characterized as an mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) effector, as a regulator of DAF-2 endosomal recycling transport, which traces a functional correlation between endocytic recycling and aging processes. Together, our results provide an alternative and effective strategy for identifying genes and pathways that mediate crosstalk between bioprocesses with little prior knowledge.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to coding a subject’s location in space, the hippocampus has been suggested to code social information, including the spatial position of conspecifics. “Social place cells” have been reported for tasks in which an observer mimics the behavior of a demonstrator. We examine whether rat hippocampal neurons may encode the behavior of a minirobot, but without requiring the animal to mimic it. Rather than finding social place cells, we observe that robot behavioral patterns modulate place fields coding animal position. This modulation may be confounded by correlations between robot movement and changes in the animal’s position. Although rat position indeed significantly predicts robot behavior, we find that hippocampal ensembles code additional information about robot movement patterns. Fast-spiking interneurons are particularly informative about robot position and global behavior. In conclusion, when the animal’s own behavior is conditional on external agents, the hippocampus multiplexes information about self and others.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotes, cellular respiration is driven by mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), an enzyme complex that requires copper cofactors for its catalytic activity. Insertion of copper into its catalytically active subunits, including COX2, is a complex process that requires metallochaperones and redox proteins including SCO1, SCO2, and COA6, a recently discovered protein whose molecular function is unknown. To uncover the molecular mechanism by which COA6 and SCO proteins mediate copper delivery to COX2, we have solved the solution structure of COA6, which reveals a coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain typical of redox-active proteins found in the mitochondrial inter-membrane space. Accordingly, we demonstrate that COA6 can reduce the copper-coordinating disulfides of its client proteins, SCO1 and COX2, allowing for copper binding. Finally, our determination of the interaction surfaces and reduction potentials of COA6 and its client proteins provides a mechanism of how metallochaperone and disulfide reductase activities are coordinated to deliver copper to CcO.

Abstract: Summary
LACC1 genetic variants are associated with multiple immune-mediated diseases. However, laccase domain containing-1 (LACC1) functions are incompletely defined. We find that upon stimulation of the pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) NOD2, LACC1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and forms a complex with ER-stress sensors. All three ER-stress branches, PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6, are required for NOD2-induced signaling, cytokines, and antimicrobial pathways in human macrophages. LACC1, and its localization to the ER, is required for these outcomes. Relative to wild-type (WT) LACC1, transfection of the common Val254 and rare Arg284 immune-mediated disease-risk LACC1 variants into HeLa cells and macrophages, as well as macrophages from LACC1 Val254 carriers, shows reduced NOD2-induced ER stress-associated outcomes; these downstream outcomes are restored by rescuing ER stress. Therefore, we identify ER stress to be essential in PRR-induced outcomes in macrophages, define a critical role for LACC1 in these ER stress-dependent events, and elucidate how LACC1 disease-risk variants mediate these outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
Ferroptosis, regulated cell death characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lethal lipid reactive oxygen species, contributes to tissue homeostasis and numerous pathologies, and it may be exploited for therapy. Cells differ in their sensitivity to ferroptosis, however, and a key challenge is to understand mechanisms that contribute to resistance. Using RNA-seq to identify genes that contribute to ferroptosis resistance, we discovered that pro-ferroptotic stimuli, including inhibition of the lipid hydroperoxidase GPX4 and detachment from the extracellular matrix, induce expression of prominin2, a pentaspanin protein implicated in regulation of lipid dynamics. Prominin2 facilitates ferroptosis resistance in mammary epithelial and breast carcinoma cells. Mechanistically, prominin2 promotes the formation of ferritin-containing multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and exosomes that transport iron out of the cell, inhibiting ferroptosis. These findings reveal that ferroptosis resistance can be driven by a prominin2-MVB-exosome-ferritin pathway and have broad implications for iron homeostasis, intracellular trafficking, and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Generation of protective immunity to infections and vaccinations declines with age. Studies in healthy individuals have implicated reduced miR-181a expression in T cells as contributing to this defect. To understand the impact of miR-181a expression on antiviral responses, we examined LCMV infection in mice with miR-181ab1-deficient T cells. We found that miR-181a deficiency delays viral clearance, thereby biasing the immune response in favor of CD4 over CD8 T cells. Antigen-specific CD4 T cells in mice with miR-181a-deficient T cells expand more and have a broader TCR repertoire with preferential expansion of high-affinity T cells than in wild-type mice. Importantly, generation of antigen-specific miR-181a-deficient CD8 effector T cells is particularly impaired, resulting in lower frequencies of CD8 T cells in the liver even at time points when the infection has been cleared. Consistent with the mouse model, CD4 memory T cells in individuals infected with West Nile virus at older ages tend to be more frequent and of higher affinity.

The spatiotemporal events that may lead to rapid TCR triggering and signal amplification in microvilli-driven isolated contacts, and in subsequent, more uniform contacts, remain poorly understood. Here, we combined interference-reflectance microscopy and single-molecule localization microscopy in live cells to resolve TCR-dependent signaling at tight cell contacts. We show that early contacts are sufficient for robust TCR triggering and ZAP-70 recruitment. With cell spreading, TCR activation and ZAP-70 recruitment increase and shift to the edges of the growing tight contacts. CD45 segregates from TCR at tight contacts and is enriched at high local curvature membrane. Surprisingly, cortical actin and LFA localized at contact regions of intermediate tightness. Our results show in molecular detail the roles of early and tight T cell contacts in T cell activation, as both sensing and decision-making entities.

Abstract: Summary
Germinal centers (GC) are crucial for the formation of long-lived humoral immunity. Many pathogens suppress GC, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm), but the mechanisms driving suppression remain unknown. We report that neither plasmablasts nor STm-specific B cells are required for GC suppression in mice. Rather, we identify that interleukin-12 (IL-12), but not interferon-γ (IFN-γ), directly suppresses T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation of T cells intrinsically. Administering recombinant IL-12 during nitrophenyl-Chicken Gamma Globulin (NP-CGG) immunization also suppresses Tfh cell differentiation and GC B cells, indicating that IL-12 is sufficient to suppress Tfh cell differentiation independent of STm infection. Recombinant IL-12 induces high levels of T-bet, and T-bet is necessary for Tfh cell suppression. Therefore, IL-12 induced during STm infection in mice contributes to GC suppression via suppression of Tfh cell differentiation. More broadly, these data suggest that IL-12 can tailor the proportions of humoral (Tfh cell) and cellular (T helper type 1 [Th1] cell) immunity to the infection, with implications for IL-12 targeting therapies in autoimmunity and vaccination.

Abstract: Summary
The thymic function to produce self-protective and self-tolerant T cells is chiefly mediated by cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) and medullary TECs (mTECs). Recent studies including single-cell transcriptomic analyses have highlighted a rich diversity in functional mTEC subpopulations. Because of their limited cellularity, however, the biochemical characterization of TECs, including the proteomic profiling of cTECs and mTECs, has remained unestablished. Utilizing genetically modified mice that carry enlarged but functional thymuses, here we show a combination of proteomic and transcriptomic profiles for cTECs and mTECs, which identified signature molecules that characterize a developmental and functional contrast between cTECs and mTECs. Our results reveal a highly specific impact of the thymoproteasome on proteasome subunit composition in cTECs and provide an integrated trans-omics platform for further exploration of thymus biology.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) cause cardiomyopathy and also disrupt nuclear positioning in fibroblasts. LMNA mutations causing cardiomyopathy elevate ERK1/2 activity in the heart, and inhibition of the ERK1/2 kinase activity ameliorates pathology, but the downstream effectors remain largely unknown. We now show that cardiomyocytes from mice with an Lmna mutation and elevated cardiac ERK1/2 activity have altered nuclear positioning. In fibroblasts, ERK1/2 activation negatively regulated nuclear movement by phosphorylating S498 of FHOD1. Expression of an unphosphorylatable FHOD1 variant rescued the nuclear movement defect in fibroblasts expressing a cardiomyopathy-causing lamin A mutant. In hearts of mice with LMNA mutation-induced cardiomyopathy, ERK1/2 mediated phosphorylation of FHOD3, an isoform highly expressed in cardiac tissue. Phosphorylation of FHOD1 and FHOD3 inhibited their actin bundling activity. These results show that phosphorylation of FHOD proteins by ERK1/2 is a critical switch for nuclear positioning and may play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy caused by LMNA mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Dynamic establishment of histone modifications in early development coincides with programed cell fate restriction and loss of totipotency beyond the early blastocyst stage. Causal function of histone-modifying enzymes in this process remains to be defined. Here we show that inhibiting histone methyltransferase MLL1 reprograms naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to expanded pluripotent stem cells (EPSCs), with differentiation potential toward both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in vitro and in vivo. MLL1 inhibition or deletion upregulates gene signatures of early blastomere development. The function of MLL1 in restricting induction of EPSCs is mediated partly by Gc, which regulates cellular response to vitamin D signaling. Combined treatment of MLL1 inhibitor and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) cooperatively enhanced functionality of EPSCs, triggering an extended 2C-like state in vitro and robust totipotent-like property in vivo. Our study sheds light on interplay between epigenetics and vitamin D pathway in cell fate determination.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro gametogenesis is the process of making germline cells from human pluripotent stem cells. The foundation of this model is the quality of the first progenitors called primordial germ cells (PGCs), which in vivo are specified during the peri-implantation window of human development. Here, we show that human PGC (hPGC) specification begins at day 12 post-fertilization. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) differentiated from pluripotent stem cells, we discovered that hPGCLC specification involves resetting pluripotency toward a transitional state with shared characteristics between naive and primed pluripotency, followed by differentiation into lineage-primed TFAP2A+ progenitors. Applying the germline trajectory to TFAP2C mutants reveals that TFAP2C functions in the TFAP2A+ progenitors upstream of PRDM1 to regulate the expression of SOX17. This serves to protect hPGCLCs from crossing the Weismann’s barrier to adopt somatic cell fates and, therefore, is an essential mechanism for successfully initiating in vitro gametogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Taste drives appropriate food preference and intake. In Drosophila, taste neurons are housed in both external and internal organs, but the latter have been relatively underexplored. Here, we report that Poxn mutants with a minimal taste system of pharyngeal neurons can avoid many aversive tastants, including bitter compounds, acid, and salt, suggesting that pharyngeal taste is sufficient for rejecting intake of aversive compounds. Optogenetic activation of selected pharyngeal bitter neurons during feeding events elicits changes in feeding parameters that can suppress intake. Functional dissection experiments indicate that multiple classes of pharyngeal neurons are involved in achieving behavioral avoidance, by virtue of being inhibited or activated by aversive tastants. Tracing second-order pharyngeal circuits reveals two main relay centers for processing pharyngeal taste inputs. Together, our results suggest that the pharynx can control the ingestion of harmful compounds by integrating taste input from different classes of pharyngeal neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic signaling to chromatin often underlies how adaptive transcriptional responses are controlled. While intermediary metabolites serve as co-factors for histone-modifying enzymes during metabolic flux, how these modifications contribute to transcriptional responses is poorly understood. Here, we utilize the highly synchronized yeast metabolic cycle (YMC) and find that fatty acid β-oxidation genes are periodically expressed coincident with the β-oxidation byproduct histone crotonylation. Specifically, we found that H3K9 crotonylation peaks when H3K9 acetylation declines and energy resources become limited. During this metabolic state, pro-growth gene expression is dampened; however, mutation of the Taf14 YEATS domain, a H3K9 crotonylation reader, results in de-repression of these genes. Conversely, exogenous addition of crotonic acid results in increased histone crotonylation, constitutive repression of pro-growth genes, and disrupted YMC oscillations. Together, our findings expose an unexpected link between metabolic flux and transcription and demonstrate that histone crotonylation and Taf14 participate in the repression of energy-demanding gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
A large number of experiments have indicated that precise spike times, firing rates, and synapse locations crucially determine the dynamics of long-term plasticity induction in excitatory synapses. However, it remains unknown how plasticity mechanisms of synapses distributed along dendritic trees cooperate to produce the wide spectrum of outcomes for various plasticity protocols. Here, we propose a four-pathway plasticity framework that is well grounded in experimental evidence and apply it to a biophysically realistic cortical pyramidal neuron model. We show in computer simulations that several seemingly contradictory experimental landmark studies are consistent with one unifying set of mechanisms when considering the effects of signal propagation in dendritic trees with respect to synapse location. Our model identifies specific spatiotemporal contributions of dendritic and axo-somatic spikes as well as of subthreshold activation of synaptic clusters, providing a unified parsimonious explanation not only for rate and timing dependence but also for location dependence of synaptic changes.

Abstract: Summary
Appropriate axonal growth and connectivity are essential for functional wiring of the brain. Joubert syndrome-related disorders (JSRD), a group of ciliopathies in which mutations disrupt primary cilia function, are characterized by axonal tract malformations. However, little is known about how cilia-driven signaling regulates axonal growth and connectivity. We demonstrate that the deletion of related JSRD genes, Arl13b and Inpp5e, in projection neurons leads to de-fasciculated and misoriented axonal tracts. Arl13b deletion disrupts the function of its downstream effector, Inpp5e, and deregulates ciliary-PI3K/AKT signaling. Chemogenetic activation of ciliary GPCR signaling and cilia-specific optogenetic modulation of downstream second messenger cascades (PI3K, AKT, and AC3) commonly regulated by ciliary signaling receptors induce rapid changes in axonal dynamics. Further, Arl13b deletion leads to changes in transcriptional landscape associated with dysregulated PI3K/AKT signaling. These data suggest that ciliary signaling acts to modulate axonal connectivity and that impaired primary cilia signaling underlies axonal tract defects in JSRD.

Abstract: Summary
During mammalian spermatogenesis, germ cell chromatin undergoes dramatic histone acetylation-mediated reorganization, whereby 90%–99% of histones are evicted. Given the potential role of retained histones in fertility and embryonic development, the genomic location of retained nucleosomes is of great interest. However, the ultimate position and mechanisms underlying nucleosome eviction or retention are poorly understood, including several studies utilizing micrococcal-nuclease sequencing (MNase-seq) methodologies reporting remarkably dissimilar locations. We utilized assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) in mouse sperm and found nucleosome enrichment at promoters but also retention at inter- and intragenic regions and repetitive elements. We further generated germ-cell-specific, conditional knockout mice for the key histone acetyltransferase Gcn5, which resulted in abnormal chromatin dynamics leading to increased sperm histone retention and severe reproductive phenotypes. Our findings demonstrate that Gcn5-mediated histone acetylation promotes chromatin accessibility and nucleosome eviction in spermiogenesis and that loss of histone acetylation leads to defects that disrupt male fertility and potentially early embryogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Interferons (IFN) are pleiotropic cytokines essential for defense against infection, but the identity and tissue distribution of IFN-responsive cells in vivo are poorly defined. In this study, we generate a mouse strain capable of reporting IFN-signaling activated by all three types of IFNs and investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics and identity of IFN-responding cells following IFN injection and influenza virus infection. Despite ubiquitous expression of IFN receptors, cellular responses to IFNs are highly heterogenous in vivo and are determined by anatomical site, cell type, cellular preference to individual IFNs, and activation status. Unexpectedly, type I and II pneumocytes, the primary target of influenza infection, exhibit striking differences in the strength and temporal dynamics of IFN signaling associated with differential susceptibility to the viral infection. Our findings suggest that time- and cell-type-dependent integration of distinct IFN signals govern the specificity and magnitude of IFN responses in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibitory receptors (IRs) function as critical regulators of immune responses by tempering T cell activity. In humans, several persisting viruses as well as cancers exploit IR signaling by upregulating IR ligands, resulting in suppression of T cell function (i.e., exhaustion). This allows escape from immune surveillance and continuation of disease. Here, we report the design, implementation, and results of a phenotypic high-throughput screen for molecules that modulate CD8+ T cell activity. We identify 19 compounds from the ReFRAME drug-repurposing collection that restore cytokine production and enhance the proliferation of exhausted T cells. Analysis of our top hit, ingenol mebutate, a protein kinase C (PKC) inducing diterpene ester, reveals a role for this molecule in overriding the suppressive signaling cascade mediated by IR signaling on T cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate a disease-relevant methodology for identifying modulators of T cell function and reveal new targets for immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) can initiate pathologic inflammation in allergic asthma by secreting copious amounts of type 2 cytokines, promoting lung eosinophilia and airway hyperreactivity (AHR), a cardinal feature of asthma. We discovered that the TNF/TNFR2 axis is a central immune checkpoint in murine and human ILC2s. ILC2s selectively express TNFR2, and blocking the TNF/TNFR2 axis inhibits survival and cytokine production and reduces ILC2-dependent AHR. The mechanism of action of TNFR2 in ILC2s is through the non-canonical NF-κB pathway as an NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) inhibitor blocks the costimulatory effect of TNF-α. Similarly, human ILC2s selectively express TNFR2, and using hILC2s, we show that TNFR2 engagement promotes AHR through a NIK-dependent pathway in alymphoid murine recipients. These findings highlight the role of the TNF/TNFR2 axis in pulmonary ILC2s, suggesting that targeting TNFR2 or relevant signaling is a different strategy for treating patients with ILC2-dependent asthma.

Abstract: Summary
Intestinal microfold cells (M cells) in Peyer’s patches are a special subset of epithelial cells that initiate mucosal immune responses through uptake of luminal antigens. Although the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) expressed on mesenchymal cells triggers differentiation into M cells, other environmental cues remain unknown. Here, we show that the metastasis-promoting protein S100A4 is required for development of mature M cells. S100A4-producing cells are a heterogenous cell population including lysozyme-expressing dendritic cells and group 3 innate lymphoid cells. We found that in the absence of DOCK8, a Cdc42 activator critical for interstitial leukocyte migration, S100A4-producing cells are reduced in the subepithelial dome, resulting in a maturation defect of M cells. While S100A4 promotes differentiation into mature M cells in organoid culture, genetic inactivation of S100a4 prevents the development of mature M cells in mice. Thus, S100A4 is a key environmental cue that regulates M cell differentiation in collaboration with RANKL.

Abstract: Summary
Regenerative responses predispose tissues to tumor formation by largely unknown mechanisms. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a danger-associated molecular pattern contributing to inflammatory pathologies. We show that HMGB1 derived from keratinocytes, but not myeloid cells, delays cutaneous wound healing and drives tumor formation. In wounds of mice lacking HMGB1 selectively in keratinocytes, a marked reduction in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is observed. Pharmacological targeting of HMGB1 or NETs prevents skin tumorigenesis and accelerates wound regeneration. HMGB1-dependent NET formation and skin tumorigenesis is orchestrated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and requires RIPK1 kinase activity. NETs are present in the microenvironment of keratinocyte-derived tumors in mice and lesional and tumor skin of patients suffering from recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a disease in which skin blistering predisposes to tumorigenesis. We conclude that tumorigenicity of the wound microenvironment depends on epithelial-derived HMGB1 regulating NET formation, thereby establishing a mechanism linking reparative inflammation to tumor initiation.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) coordinates cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism with environmental inputs, yet how extracellular stimuli such as growth factors (GFs) activate mTORC2 remains enigmatic. Here we demonstrate that in human endothelial cells, activation of mTORC2 signaling by GFs is mediated by transmembrane cell adhesion protein CD146. Upon GF stimulation, the cytoplasmic tail of CD146 is phosphorylated, which permits its positively charged, juxtamembrane KKGK motif to interact with Rictor, the defining subunit of mTORC2. The formation of the CD146-Rictor/mTORC2 complex protects Rictor from ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation, thereby specifically upregulating mTORC2 activity with no intervention of the PI3K and mTORC1 pathways. This CD146-mediated mTORC2 activation in response to GF stimulation promotes cell proliferation and survival. Therefore, our findings identify a molecular mechanism by which extracellular stimuli regulate mTORC2 activity, linking environmental cues with mTORC2 regulation.

Here, we identified antigen-specific IL-10+IFN-γ+ double-positive (DP) CD4 T cells during acute DENV infection. While the transcriptomic signatures of DP cells partially overlapped with those of cytotoxic and type 1 regulatory CD4 T cells, the majority of them were non-cytotoxic/Tr1 and included IL21, IL22, CD109, and CCR1. Although we observed a higher frequency of DP cells in DHF, the transcriptomic profile of DP cells was similar in DF and DHF, suggesting that DHF is not associated with the altered phenotypic or functional attributes of DP cells. Overall, this study revealed a DENV-specific DP cell subset in patients with acute dengue disease and argues against altered DP cells as a determinant of DHF.

Abstract: Summary
The vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)-VEGFR2 pathway drives tumor vascularization by activating proangiogenic signaling in endothelial cells (ECs). Here, we show that EC-sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) amplifies VEGFR2-mediated angiogenic signaling to enhance tumor growth. We show that cancer cells induce S1PR1 activity in ECs, and thereby, conditional deletion of S1PR1 in ECs (EC-S1pr1−/− mice) impairs tumor vascularization and growth. Mechanistically, we show that S1PR1 engages the heterotrimeric G-protein Gi, which amplifies VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling due to an increase in the activity of the tyrosine kinase c-Abl1. c-Abl1, by phosphorylating VEGFR2 at tyrosine-951, prolongs VEGFR2 retention on the plasmalemma to sustain Rac1 activity and EC migration. Thus, S1PR1 or VEGFR2 antagonists, alone or in combination, reverse the tumor growth in control mice to the level seen in EC-S1pr1−/− mice. Our findings suggest that blocking S1PR1 activity in ECs has the potential to suppress tumor growth by preventing amplification of VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling.

Abstract: Shoot branching is an essential agronomic trait that impacts on plant architecture and yield. Shoot branching is determined by two independent steps: axillary meristem formation and axillary bud outgrowth. Although several genes and regulatory mechanism have been studied with respect to shoot branching, the roles of chromatin-remodeling factors in the developmental process have not been reported in rice. We previously identified a chromatin-remodeling factor OsVIL2 that controls the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at target genes. In this study, we report that loss-of-function mutants in OsVIL2 showed a phenotype of reduced tiller number in rice. The reduction was due to a defect in axillary bud (tiller) outgrowth rather than axillary meristem initiation. Analysis of the expression patterns of the tiller-related genes revealed that expression of OsTB1, which is a negative regulator of bud outgrowth, was increased in osvil2 mutants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that OsVIL2 binds to the promoter region of OsTB1 chromatin in wild-type rice, but the binding was not observed in osvil2 mutants. Tiller number of double mutant osvil2 ostb1 was similar to that of ostb1, suggesting that osvil2 is epistatic to ostb1. These observations indicate that OsVIL2 suppresses OsTB1 expression by chromatin modification, thereby inducing bud outgrowth.

Abstract: MicroRNA-223-3p (miR-223-3p) is one of the potential microRNAs that have been shown to alleviate inflammatory responses in pre-clinical investigations and is highly encased in exosomes derived from bone mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-exosomes). MSC-exosomes are able to function as carriers to deliver microRNAs into cells. Autoimmune hepatitis is one of the challenging liver diseases with no effective treatment other than steroid hormones. Here, we examined whether MSC-exosomes can transfer miR-223-3p to treat autoimmune hepatitis in an experimental model. We found that MSC-exosomes were successfully incorporated with miR-223-3p and delivered miR-223-3p into macrophages. Moreover, there was no toxic effect of exosomes on the macrophages. Furthermore, treatments of either exosomes or exosomes with miR-223-3p successfully attenuated inflammatory responses in the liver of autoimmune hepatitis and inflammatory cytokine release in both the liver and macrophages. The mechanism may be related to the regulation of miR-223-3p level and STAT3 expression in the liver and macrophages. These results suggest that MSC-exosomes can be used to deliver miR-223-3p for the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis.

Abstract: Summary
Androgen-receptor (AR) inhibitors, including enzalutamide, are used for treatment of all metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (mCRPCs). However, some patients develop resistance or never respond. We find that the transcription factor CREB5 confers enzalutamide resistance in an open reading frame (ORF) expression screen and in tumor xenografts. CREB5 overexpression is essential for an enzalutamide-resistant patient-derived organoid. In AR-expressing prostate cancer cells, CREB5 interactions enhance AR activity at a subset of promoters and enhancers upon enzalutamide treatment, including MYC and genes involved in the cell cycle. In mCRPC, we found recurrent amplification and overexpression of CREB5. Our observations identify CREB5 as one mechanism that drives resistance to AR antagonists in prostate cancers.

Abstract: Summary
Small molecules that directly target MYC and are also well tolerated in vivo will provide invaluable chemical probes and potential anti-cancer therapeutic agents. We developed a series of small-molecule MYC inhibitors that engage MYC inside cells, disrupt MYC/MAX dimers, and impair MYC-driven gene expression. The compounds enhance MYC phosphorylation on threonine-58, consequently increasing proteasome-mediated MYC degradation. The initial lead, MYC inhibitor 361 (MYCi361), suppressed in vivo tumor growth in mice, increased tumor immune cell infiltration, upregulated PD-L1 on tumors, and sensitized tumors to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. However, 361 demonstrated a narrow therapeutic index. An improved analog, MYCi975 showed better tolerability. These findings suggest the potential of small-molecule MYC inhibitors as chemical probes and possible anti-cancer therapeutic agents.

Abstract: Summary
Bone marrow (BM) stromal cells provide the regulatory framework for hematopoiesis and contribute to developmental stage-specific niches, such as those preserving hematopoietic stem cells. Despite advances in our understanding of stromal function, little is known about the transcriptional changes that this compartment undergoes throughout lifespan and during adaptation to stress. Using RNA sequencing, we perform transcriptional analyses of four principal stromal subsets, namely CXCL12-abundant reticular, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-α+Sca1+, sinusoidal, and arterial endothelial cells, from early postnatal, adult, and aged mice. Our data reveal (1) molecular fingerprints defining cell-specific anatomical and functional features, (2) a radical reprogramming of pro-hematopoietic, immune, and matrisomic transcriptional programs during the transition from juvenile stages to adulthood, and (3) the aging-driven progressive upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression in stroma. We further demonstrate that transcriptomic pathways elicited in vivo by prototypic microbial molecules are largely recapitulated during aging, thereby supporting the inflammatory basis of age-related adaptations of BM hematopoietic function.

Abstract: Summary
Lymph nodes (LNs) act as filters, constantly sampling peripheral cues. This is facilitated by the conduit network, a tubular structure of aligned extracellular matrix (ECM) fibrils ensheathed by fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). LNs undergo rapid 3- to 5-fold expansion during adaptive immune responses, but these ECM-rich structures are not permanently damaged. Whether conduit flow or filtering function is affected during LN expansion is unknown. Here, we show that conduits are partially disrupted during acute LN expansion, but FRC-FRC contacts remain connected. We reveal that polarized FRCs deposit ECM basolaterally using LL5-β and that ECM production is regulated at transcriptional and secretory levels by the C-type lectin CLEC-2, expressed by dendritic cells. Inflamed LNs maintain conduit size exclusion, and flow is disrupted but persists, indicating the robustness of this structure despite rapid tissue expansion. We show how dynamic communication between peripheral tissues and LNs provides a mechanism to prevent inflammation-induced fibrosis in lymphoid tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and accumulation of α-synuclein. Impaired autophagy has been implicated and activation of autophagy proposed as a treatment strategy. We generate a human α-synuclein-expressing mouse model of PD with macroautophagic failure in dopamine neurons to understand the interaction between impaired macroautophagy and α-synuclein. We find that impaired macroautophagy generates p62-positive inclusions and progressive neuron loss in the SNc. Despite this parkinsonian pathology, motor phenotypes accompanying human α-synuclein overexpression actually improve with impaired macroautophagy. Real-time fast-scan cyclic voltammetry reveals that macroautophagy impairment in dopamine neurons increases evoked extracellular concentrations of dopamine, reduces dopamine uptake, and relieves paired-stimulus depression. Our findings show that impaired macroautophagy paradoxically enhances dopamine neurotransmission, improving movement while worsening pathology, suggesting that changes to dopamine synapse function compensate for and conceal the underlying PD pathogenesis, with implications for therapies that target autophagy.

Abstract: Summary
Given the increasing interest in their use as disease biomarkers, the establishment of reproducible, accurate, sensitive, and specific platforms for microRNA (miRNA) quantification in biofluids is of high priority. We compare four platforms for these characteristics: small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), FirePlex, EdgeSeq, and nCounter. For a pool of synthetic miRNAs, coefficients of variation for technical replicates are lower for EdgeSeq (6.9%) and RNA-seq (8.2%) than for FirePlex (22.4%); nCounter replicates are not performed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for distinguishing present versus absent miRNAs shows small RNA-seq (area under curve 0.99) is superior to EdgeSeq (0.97), nCounter (0.94), and FirePlex (0.81). Expected differences in expression of placenta-associated miRNAs in plasma from pregnant and non-pregnant women are observed with RNA-seq and EdgeSeq, but not FirePlex or nCounter. These results indicate that differences in performance among miRNA profiling platforms impact ability to detect biological differences among samples and thus their relative utility for research and clinical use.

Abstract: Summary
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leaves many survivors with long-term disabilities. A prolonged immune response in the brain may cause neurodegeneration, resulting in chronic neurological disturbances. In this study, using a TBI mouse model, we correlate changes in the local immune response with neurodegeneration/neurological dysfunction over an 8-month period. Flow cytometric analysis reveals a protracted increase in effector/memory CD8+ T cells (expressing granzyme B) in the injured brain. This precedes interleukin-17+CD4+ T cell infiltration and is associated with progressive neurological/motor impairment, increased circulating brain-specific autoantibodies, and myelin-related pathology. Genetic deficiency or pharmacological depletion of CD8+ T cells, but not depletion of CD4+ T cells, improves neurological outcomes and produces a neuroprotective Th2/Th17 immunological shift, indicating a persistent detrimental role for cytotoxic T cells post-TBI. B cell deficiency results in severe neurological dysfunction and a heightened immune reaction. Targeting these adaptive immune cells offers a promising approach to improve recovery following TBI.

Abstract: Summary
Syntaphilin (SNPH) is a major mitochondrial anchoring protein targeted to axons and excluded from dendrites. In this study, we provide in vivo evidence that this spatial specificity is lost in Shiverer (Shi) mice, a model for progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), resulting in inappropriate intrusion of SNPH into dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje cells with neurodegenerative consequences. Thus, reconstituting dendritic SNPH intrusion in SNPH-KO mice by viral transduction greatly sensitizes Purkinje cells to excitotoxicity when the glutamatergic climbing fibers are stimulated. Finally, we demonstrate in vitro that overexpression of SNPH in dendrites compromises neuronal viability by inducing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) excitotoxicity, reducing mitochondrial calcium uptake, and interfering with quality control of mitochondria by blocking somal mitophagy. Collectively, we propose that inappropriate immobilization of dendritic mitochondria by SNPH intrusion produces excitotoxicity and suggest that interception of dendritic SNPH intrusion is a therapeutic strategy to combat neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Most current tumor immunotherapy strategies leverage cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Despite evidence for clinical potential of CD4+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), their functional diversity limits our ability to harness their activity. Here, we use single-cell mRNA sequencing to analyze the response of tumor-specific CD4+ TILs and draining lymph node (dLN) T cells. Computational approaches to characterize subpopulations identify TIL transcriptomic patterns strikingly distinct from acute and chronic anti-viral responses and dominated by diversity among T-bet-expressing T helper type 1 (Th1)-like cells. In contrast, the dLN response includes T follicular helper (Tfh) cells but lacks Th1 cells. We identify a type I interferon-driven signature in Th1-like TILs and show that it is found in human cancers, in which it is negatively associated with response to checkpoint therapy. Our study provides a proof-of-concept methodology to characterize tumor-specific CD4+ T cell effector programs. Targeting these programs should help improve immunotherapy strategies.

Abstract: Ultraviolet light (UV)-induced cellular response has been studied by numerous investigators for many years. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as new regulators of diverse cellular process; however, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in the cellular response to UV treatment. Here, we demonstrate that levels of lncRNA-HOTTIP significantly increases after UV stimulation and regulates the UV-mediated cellular response to UV through the coordinate activation of its neighboring gene Hoxa13 in GC-1 cells (spermatogonia germ cell line). UV-induced, G2/M-phase arrest and early apoptosis can be regulated by lncRNA-HOTTIP and Hoxa13. Furthermore, lncRNA-HOTTIP can up-regulate γ-H2AX and p53 expression via Hoxa13 in UV-irradiated GC-1 cells. In addition, p53 has the ability to regulate the expression of both lncRNA-HOTTIP and Hoxa13 in vitro and in vivo. Our results provide new data regarding the role lncRNAs play in the UV response in spermatogenic cells.

Abstract: Summary
Fringe glycosyltransferases differentially modulate the binding of Notch receptors to Delta/DLL versus Serrate/Jagged ligands by adding GlcNAc to O-linked fucose on Notch epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats. Although Notch has 22 O-fucosylation sites, the biologically relevant sites affecting Notch activity during animal development in vivo in the presence or absence of Fringe are not known. Using a variety of assays, we find important roles in Drosophila Notch signaling for GlcNAc-fucose-O glycans on three sites: EGF8, EGF9, and EGF12. O-Fucose monosaccharide on EGF12 (in the absence of Fringe) is essential for Delta-mediated lateral inhibition in embryos. However, wing vein development depends on the addition of GlcNAc to EGF8 and EGF12 by Fringe, with a minor contribution from EGF9. Fringe modifications of EGF8 and EGF12 together prevent Notch from cis-inhibiting Serrate, thereby promoting normal wing margin formation. Our work shows the combinatorial and context-dependent roles of GlcNAc-fucose-O glycans on these sites in Drosophila Notch-ligand interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Sequences within 5′ UTRs dictate the site and efficiency of translation initiation. In this study, an unbiased screen designed to interrogate the 5′ UTR-mediated regulation of the growth-promoting gene MYC unexpectedly revealed the ribosomal pause relief factor eIF5A as a regulator of translation initiation codon selection. Depletion of eIF5A enhances upstream translation within 5′ UTRs across yeast and human transcriptomes, including on the MYC transcript, where this results in increased production of an N-terminally extended protein. Furthermore, ribosome profiling experiments established that the function of eIF5A as a suppressor of ribosomal pausing at sites of suboptimal peptide bond formation is conserved in human cells. We present evidence that proximal ribosomal pausing on a transcript triggers enhanced use of upstream suboptimal or non-canonical initiation codons. Thus, we propose that eIF5A functions not only to maintain efficient translation elongation in eukaryotic cells but also to maintain the fidelity of translation initiation.

Abstract: Summary
Helminth parasites infect more than a quarter of the human population and inflict significant changes to the immunological status of their hosts. Here, we analyze the impact of helminth infections on the efficacy of vaccinations using Litomosoides sigmodontis-infected mice. Concurrent helminth infection reduces the quantity and quality of antibody responses to vaccination against seasonal influenza. Vaccination-induced protection against challenge infections with the human pathogenic 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus is drastically impaired in helminth-infected mice. Impaired responses are also observed if vaccinations are performed after clearance of a previous helminth infection, suggesting that individuals in helminth-endemic areas may not always benefit from vaccinations, even in the absence of an acute and diagnosable helminth infection. Mechanistically, the suppression is associated with a systemic and sustained expansion of interleukin (IL)-10-producing CD4+CD49+LAG-3+ type 1 regulatory T cells and partially abrogated by in vivo blockade of the IL-10 receptor.

Abstract: The spatiotemporal mitotic processes are controlled qualitatively by phosphorylation and qualitatively by ubiquitination. Although the SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein (SCF) complex and the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) mainly mediate ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of mitotic regulators, the E3 ligase for a large portion of mitotic proteins has yet to be identified. Here, we report c-Cbl as an E3 ligase that degrades DDA3, a protein involved in spindle dynamics. Depletion of c-Cbl led to increased DDA3 protein levels, resulting in increased recruitment of Kif2a to the mitotic spindle, a concomitant reduction in spindle formation, and chromosome alignment defects. Furthermore, c-Cbl depletion induced centrosome over-duplication and centriole amplification. Therefore, we concluded that c-Cbl controls spindle dynamics and centriole duplication through its E3 ligase activity against DDA3.

Abstract: Summary
Broadly HIV-1 neutralizing VRC01 class antibodies target the CD4-binding site of Env. They are derived from VH1-2∗02 antibody heavy chains paired with rare light chains expressing 5-amino acid-long CDRL3s. They have been isolated from infected subjects but have not yet been elicited by immunization. Env-derived immunogens capable of binding the germline forms of VRC01 B cell receptors on naive B cells have been designed and evaluated in knockin mice. However, the elicited antibodies cannot bypass glycans present on the conserved position N276 of Env, which restricts access to the CD4-binding site. Efforts to guide the appropriate maturation of these antibodies by sequential immunization have not yet been successful. Here, we report on a two-step immunization scheme that leads to the maturation of VRC01-like antibodies capable of accommodating the N276 glycan and displaying autologous tier 2 neutralizing activities. Our results are relevant to clinical trials aiming to elicit VRC01 antibodies.

Abstract: Summary
Embryos control force generation at tissue boundaries, but how they do so remains poorly understood. Here we show how tissue-specific expression of the type II cadherin, Cadherin2, patterns actomyosin contractility along tissue boundaries to control zippering and neural tube closure in the basal chordate, Ciona robusta. Cadherin2 is differentially expressed and homotypically enriched in neural cells along the neural/epidermal (Ne/Epi) boundary, where RhoA and myosin are activated during zipper progression. Homotypically enriched Cadherin2 sequesters the Rho GTPase-activating protein, Gap21/23, to homotypic junctions. Gap21/23 in turn redirects RhoA/myosin activity to heterotypic Ne/Epi junctions. By activating myosin II along Ne/Epi junctions ahead of the zipper and inhibiting myosin II along newly formed Ne/Ne junctions behind the zipper, Cadherin2 promotes tissue-level contractile asymmetry to drive zipper progression. We propose that dynamic coupling of junction exchange to local changes in contractility may control fusion and separation of epithelia in many other contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Selection of the correct targets for myelination and regulation of myelin sheath growth are essential for central nervous system (CNS) formation and function. Through a genetic screen in zebrafish and complementary analyses in mice, we find that loss of oligodendrocyte Neurofascin leads to mistargeting of myelin to cell bodies, without affecting targeting to axons. In addition, loss of Neurofascin reduces CNS myelination by impairing myelin sheath growth. Time-lapse imaging reveals that the distinct myelinating processes of individual oligodendrocytes can engage in target selection and sheath growth at the same time and that Neurofascin concomitantly regulates targeting and growth. Disruption to Caspr, the neuronal binding partner of oligodendrocyte Neurofascin, also impairs myelin sheath growth, likely reflecting its association in an adhesion complex at the axon-glial interface with Neurofascin. Caspr does not, however, affect myelin targeting, further indicating that Neurofascin independently regulates distinct aspects of CNS myelination by individual oligodendrocytes in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Despite recent studies elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying cortical patterning and map formation, very little is known about how the embryonic pallium expands ventrally to form the future cortex and the nature of the underlying force-generating events. We find that neurons born at embryonic day 10 (E10) in the mouse dorsal pallium ventrally stream until E13, thereby superficially spreading the preplate, and then constitute the subplate from E14. From E11 to E12, the preplate neurons migrate, exerting pulling and pushing forces at the process and the soma, respectively. At E13, they are morphologically heterogeneous, with ∼40% possessing corticofugal axons, which are found to be in tension. Ablation of these E10-born neurons attenuates both deflection of radial glial fibers (by E13) and extension of the cortical plate (by E14), which should occur ventrally, and subsequently shrinks the postnatal neocortical map dorsally. Thus, the preplate stream physically primes neocortical expansion and arealization.

Abstract: Summary
Enteroendocrine cells (EEs) in the intestinal epithelium have important endocrine functions, yet this cell lineage exhibits great local and regional variations that have hampered detailed characterization of EE subtypes. Through single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, combined with a collection of peptide hormone and receptor knockin strains, here we provide a comprehensive analysis of cellular diversity, spatial distribution, and transcription factor (TF) code of EEs in adult Drosophila midgut. We identify 10 major EE subtypes that totally produced approximately 14 different classes of hormone peptides. Each EE on average co-produces approximately 2–5 different classes of hormone peptides. Functional screen with subtype-enriched TFs suggests a combinatorial TF code that controls EE cell diversity; class-specific TFs Mirr and Ptx1 respectively define two major classes of EEs, and regional TFs such as Esg, Drm, Exex, and Fer1 further define regional EE identity. Our single-cell data should greatly facilitate Drosophila modeling of EE differentiation and function.

Abstract: Summary
The human interactome is instrumental in the systems-level study of the cell and the contextualization of disease-associated gene perturbations. However, reference organismal interactomes do not capture the cell-type-specific context in which proteins and modules preferentially act. Here, we introduce SCINET, a computational framework that reconstructs an ensemble of cell-type-specific interactomes by integrating a global, context-independent reference interactome with a single-cell gene-expression profile. SCINET addresses technical challenges of single-cell data by robustly imputing, transforming, and normalizing the initially noisy and sparse expression of data. Inferred cell-level gene interaction probabilities and group-level interaction strengths define cell-type-specific interactomes. We use SCINET to reconstruct and analyze interactomes of the major human brain and immune cell types, revealing specificity and modularity of perturbations associated with neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, and autoimmune disorders. We report cell-type interactomes for brain and immune cell types, together with the SCINET package.

Abstract: Summary
Fetal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) undergo a developmental switch to become adult HSCs with distinct functional properties. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental switch, we have conducted deep sequencing of the 3D genome, epigenome, and transcriptome of fetal and adult HSCs in mouse. We find that chromosomal compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) are largely conserved between fetal and adult HSCs. However, there is a global trend of increased compartmentalization and TAD boundary strength in adult HSCs. In contrast, intra-TAD chromatin interactions are much more dynamic and widespread, involving over a thousand gene promoters and distal enhancers. These developmental-stage-specific enhancer-promoter interactions are mediated by different sets of transcription factors, such as TCF3 and MAFB in fetal HSCs, versus NR4A1 and GATA3 in adult HSCs. Loss-of-function studies of TCF3 confirm the role of TCF3 in mediating condition-specific enhancer-promoter interactions and gene regulation in fetal HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
During disseminating viral infections, a swift innate immune response (IIR) in the draining lymph node (dLN) that restricts systemic viral spread is critical for optimal resistance to disease. However, it is unclear how this IIR is orchestrated. We show that after footpad infection of mice with ectromelia virus, dendritic cells (DCs) highly expressing major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class IIhi DCs), including CD207+ epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs), CD103+CD207+ double-positive dermal DCs (DP-DCs), and CD103−CD207− double-negative dermal DCs (DN-DCs) migrate to the dLN from the skin carrying virus. MHC class IIhi DCs, predominantly LCs and DP-DCs, are the first cells upregulating IIR cytokines in the dLN. Preventing MHC class IIhi DC migration or depletion of LCs, but not DP-DC deficiency, suppresses the IIR in the dLN and results in high viral lethality. Therefore, LCs are the architects of an early IIR in the dLN that is critical for optimal resistance to a disseminating viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
The immunometabolic mechanisms underlying suboptimal T cell immunity in tuberculosis remain undefined. Here, we examine how chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and M. bovis BCG infections rewire metabolic circuits and alter effector functions in lung CD8+ T cells. As Mtb infection progresses, mitochondrial metabolism deteriorates in CD8+ T cells, resulting in an increased dependency on glycolysis that potentiates inflammatory cytokine production. Over time, these cells develop bioenergetic deficiencies that reflect metabolic “quiescence.” This bioenergetic signature coincides with increased mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibitory receptor expression and was not observed in BCG infection. Remarkably, the Mtb-triggered decline in T cell bioenergetics can be reinvigorated by metformin, giving rise to an Mtb-specific CD8+ T cell population with improved metabolism. These findings provide insights into Mtb pathogenesis whereby glycolytic reprogramming and compromised mitochondrial function contribute to the breakdown of CD8+ T cell immunity during chronic disease, highlighting opportunities to reinvigorate immunity with metabolically targeted pharmacologic agents.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanosensory neurons across physiological systems sense force using diverse terminal morphologies. Arterial baroreceptors are sensory neurons that monitor blood pressure for real-time stabilization of cardiovascular output. Various aortic sensory terminals have been described, but those that sense blood pressure are unclear because of a lack of selective genetic tools. Here, we find that all baroreceptor neurons are marked in Piezo2-ires-Cre mice and then use genetic approaches to visualize the architecture of mechanosensory endings. Cre-guided ablation of vagal and glossopharyngeal PIEZO2 neurons eliminates the baroreceptor reflex and aortic depressor nerve effects on blood pressure and heart rate. Genetic mapping reveals that PIEZO2 neurons form a distinctive mechanosensory structure: macroscopic claws that surround the aortic arch and exude fine end-net endings. Other arterial sensory neurons that form flower-spray terminals are dispensable for baroreception. Together, these findings provide structural insights into how blood pressure is sensed in the aortic vessel wall.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) and formation of Lewy bodies are neuropathological characteristics of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related α-synucleinopathies. Oligomerization and spreading of α-syn from neuron to neuron have been suggested as key events contributing to the progression of PD. To directly visualize and characterize α-syn oligomerization and spreading in vivo, we generated two independent conditional transgenic mouse models based on α-syn protein complementation assays using neuron-specifically expressed split Gaussia luciferase or split Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). These transgenic mice allow direct assessment of the quantity and subcellular distribution of α-syn oligomers in vivo. Using these mouse models, we demonstrate an age-dependent accumulation of a specific subtype of α-syn oligomers. We provide in vivo evidence that, although α-syn is found throughout neurons, α-syn oligomerization takes place at the presynapse. Furthermore, our mouse models provide strong evidence for a transsynaptic cell-to-cell transfer of de novo generated α-syn oligomers in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a DNA clamp essential for DNA replication. During DNA synthesis, PCNA is continuously loaded onto and unloaded from DNA. PCNA recruits various proteins to nascent DNA to facilitate chromosome duplication. Therefore, timely PCNA unloading is crucial for high-fidelity DNA replication. The ATAD5-RFC-like complex (ATAD5-RLC) unloads PCNA from replicated DNA. It is unclear how ATAD5-RLC activity is regulated to prevent premature PCNA unloading. Here, we find that BRD4, an acetyl-histone-binding chromatin reader, inhibits the PCNA-unloading activity of ATAD5-RLC. The BRD4 ET domain interacts with a region upstream of the ATAD5 PCNA-unloading domain. BRD4-ATAD5 binds to acetyl-histones in nascent chromatin. BRD4 release from chromatin correlates with PCNA unloading. Disruption of the interaction between BRD4 and acetyl-histones or between BRD4 and ATAD5 reduces the PCNA amount on chromatin. In contrast, the overexpression of BRD4 increases the amount of chromatin-bound PCNA. Thus, acetyl-histone-bound BRD4 fine-tunes PCNA unloading from nascent DNA.

Abstract: Summary
The germline contains an immortal cell lineage that ensures the faithful transmission of genetic and, in some instances, epigenetic information from one generation to the next. Here, we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the small RNA 3′-2′-O-methyltransferase henn-1/HEN1 is required for sustained fertility across generations. In the absence of henn-1, animals become progressively less fertile, becoming sterile after ∼30 generations at 25°C. Sterility in henn-1 mutants is accompanied by severe defects in germline proliferation and maintenance. The requirement for henn-1 in transgenerational fertility is likely due to its role in methylating and, thereby, stabilizing Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). However, despite being essential for piRNA stability in embryos, henn-1 is not required for piRNA stability in adults. Thus, we propose that methylation is important for the role of piRNAs in establishing proper gene silencing during early stages of development but is dispensable for their role in the proliferated germline.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian blastocysts comprise three distinct cell lineages essential for development beyond implantation: the pluripotent epiblast, which generates the future embryo, and surrounding it the extra-embryonic primitive endoderm and the trophectoderm tissues. Embryonic stem cells can reintegrate into embryogenesis but contribute primarily to epiblast lineages. Here, we show that mouse embryonic stem cells cultured under extended pluripotent conditions (EPSCs) can be partnered with trophoblast stem cells to self-organize into blastocyst-like structures with all three embryonic and extra-embryonic lineages. Morphogenetic and transcriptome profiling analyses reveal that these blastocyst-like structures show distinct embryonic-abembryonic axes and primitive endoderm differentiation and can initiate the transition from the pre- to post-implantation egg cylinder morphology in vitro.

Abstract: Piperlongumine (PL), a natural alkaloid compound isolated from long pepper (Piper longum), can selectively kill cancer cells, but not normal cells, by accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The objective of this study was to investigate functional roles of expression of SETDB1 and FosB during PL treatment in MCF7 breast cancer cells. PL downregulates SETDB1 expression, and decreased SETDB1 expression enhanced caspase 9 dependent-PARP cleavage during PL-induced cell death. PL treatment generated ROS. ROS inhibitor NAC (N-acetyl cysteine) recovered SETDB1 expression decreased by PL. Decreased SETDB1 expression induced transcriptional activity of FosB during PL treatment. PARP cleavage and positive annexin V level were increased during PL treatment with FosB overexpression whereas PARP cleavage and positive annexin V level were decreased during PL treatment with siFosB transfection, implying that FosB might be a pro-apoptotic protein for induction of cell death in PL-treated MCF7 breast cancer cells. PL induced cell death in A549 lung cancer cells, but molecular changes involved in the induction of these cell deaths might be different. These results suggest that SETDB1 mediated FosB expression may induce cell death in PL-treated MCF7 breast cancer cells.

Abstract: Summary
Aerobic organisms need to maintain cellular redox homeostasis. Glutathione peroxidase-4 (Gpx4) has the unique ability to protect cells against lipid peroxidation. Here, we show that Gpx4 is absolutely required to prevent ferroptosis during development, maintenance, and responses of innate-like B cells, namely, the B1 and marginal zone (MZ) B cells. In contrast, Gpx4 is dispensable for the development, germinal center reactions, and antibody responses of follicular B2 cells. Mechanistically, we show increased lipid metabolism and sensitivity to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in B1 and MZ B cells compared to follicular B2 cells, consistent with the requirement of Gpx4 in innate-like B cells. This high sensitivity to ferroptosis of innate-like B cells may be used to therapeutically target Gpx4 in certain forms of B cell malignancies involving B1 cells.

Abstract: Summary
Indisulam and related sulfonamides recruit the splicing factor RBM39 to the CRL4-DCAF15 E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in RBM39 ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we used a combination of domain mapping and random mutagenesis to identify domains or residues that are necessary for indisulam-dependent RBM39 ubiquitination. DCAF15 mutations at Q232 or D475 prevent RBM39 recruitment by indisulam. RBM39 is recruited to DCAF15 by its RRM2 (RNA recognition motif 2) and is ubiquitinated on its N terminus. RBM23, which is an RBM39 paralog, is also recruited to the CRL4-DCAF15 ligase through its RRM2 domain and undergoes sulfonamide-dependent degradation. Indisulam alters the expression of more than 3,000 genes and causes widespread intron retention and exon skipping. All of these changes can be attributed to RBM39, and none are the consequence of RBM23 degradation. Our findings demonstrate that indisulam selectively degrades RBM23 and RBM39, the latter of which is critically important for splicing and gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is required for the survival and differentiation of diverse neuronal populations during nervous system development. Despite the high expression of GDNF and its receptor GFRα1 in the adult hippocampus, the functional role of this system remains unknown. Here, we show that GDNF, acting through its GFRα1 receptor, controls dendritic structure and spine density of adult-born granule cells, which reveals that GFRα1 is required for their integration into preexisting circuits. Moreover, conditional mutant mice for GFRα1 show deficits in behavioral pattern separation, a task in which adult neurogenesis is known to play a critical role. We also find that running increases GDNF in the dentate gyrus and promotes GFRα1-dependent CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) activation and dendrite maturation. Together, these findings indicate that GDNF/GFRα1 signaling plays an essential role in the plasticity of adult circuits, controlling the integration of newly generated neurons.

Abstract: Summary
Retroviral gene transfer of interleukin-12 (IL-12) into T cells markedly enhances antitumor efficacy upon adoptive transfer but has clinically shown unacceptable severe side effects. To overcome the toxicity, we engineered tumor-specific CD8+ T cells to transiently express IL-12. Engineered T cells injected intratumorally, but not intravenously, led to complete rejections not only of the injected lesion but also of distant concomitant tumors. Efficacy was further enhanced by co-injection with agonist anti-CD137 mAb or by transient co-expression of CD137 ligand. This treatment induced epitope spreading of the endogenous CD8+ T cell immune response in a manner dependent on cDC1 dendritic cells. Mouse and human tumor-infiltrating T lymphocyte cultures can be transiently IL-12 engineered to attain marked immunotherapeutic effects.

Abstract: Summary
Metformin is the front-line treatment for type 2 diabetes worldwide. It acts via effects on glucose and lipid metabolism in metabolic tissues, leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity. Despite significant effort, the molecular basis for metformin response remains poorly understood, with a limited number of specific biochemical pathways studied to date. To broaden our understanding of hepatic metformin response, we combine phospho-protein enrichment in tissue from genetically engineered mice with a quantitative proteomics platform to enable the discovery and quantification of basophilic kinase substrates in vivo. We define proteins whose binding to 14-3-3 are acutely regulated by metformin treatment and/or loss of the serine/threonine kinase, LKB1. Inducible binding of 250 proteins following metformin treatment is observed, 44% of which proteins bind in a manner requiring LKB1. Beyond AMPK, metformin activates protein kinase D and MAPKAPK2 in an LKB1-independent manner, revealing additional kinases that may mediate aspects of metformin response. Deeper analysis uncovered substrates of AMPK in endocytosis and calcium homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-cycle inhibitors, including paclitaxel, are among the most widely used and effective cancer therapies. However, several challenges limit the success of paclitaxel, including drug resistance and toxic side effects. Paclitaxel is thought to act primarily by stabilizing microtubules, locking cells in a mitotic state. However, the resulting cytotoxicity and tumor shrinkage rates observed cannot be fully explained by this mechanism alone. Here we apply quantitative chemical cross-linking with mass spectrometry analysis to paclitaxel-treated cells. Our results provide large-scale measurements of relative protein levels and, perhaps more importantly, changes to protein conformations and interactions that occur upon paclitaxel treatment. Drug concentration-dependent changes are revealed in known drug targets including tubulins, as well as many other proteins and protein complexes involved in apoptotic signaling and cellular homeostasis. As such, this study provides insight into systems-level changes to protein structures and interactions that occur with paclitaxel treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Latent proviruses persist in central (TCM), transitional (TTM), and effector (TEM) memory cells. We measured the levels of cellular factors involved in HIV gene expression in these subsets. The highest levels of acetylated H4, active nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and active positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) were measured in TEM, TCM, and TTM cells, respectively. Vorinostat and romidepsin display opposite abilities to induce H4 acetylation across subsets. Protein kinase C (PKC) agonists are more efficient at inducing NF-κB phosphorylation in TCM cells but more potent at activating PTEF-b in the TEM subset. We selected the most efficient latency-reversing agents (LRAs) and measured their ability to reverse latency in each subset. While ingenol alone has modest activities in the three subsets, its combination with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) dramatically increases latency reversal in TCM cells. Altogether, these results indicate that cellular HIV reservoirs are differentially responsive to common LRAs and suggest that combination of compounds will be required to achieve latency reversal in all subsets.

Abstract: Summary
Complement dysregulation is a feature of many retinal diseases, yet mechanistic understanding at the cellular level is limited. Given this knowledge gap about which retinal cells express complement, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on ∼92,000 mouse retinal cells and validated our results in five major purified retinal cell types. We found evidence for a distributed cell-type-specific complement expression across 11 cell types. Notably, Müller cells are the major contributor of complement activators c1s, c3, c4, and cfb. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mainly expresses cfh and the terminal complement components, whereas cfi and cfp transcripts are most abundant in neurons. Aging enhances c1s, cfb, cfp, and cfi expression, while cfh expression decreases. Transient retinal ischemia increases complement expression in microglia, Müller cells, and RPE. In summary, we report a unique complement expression signature for murine retinal cell types suggesting a well-orchestrated regulation of local complement expression in the retinal microenvironment.

Abstract: Summary
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an attractive cancer therapeutic target. Here we report the discovery of SD-36, a small-molecule degrader of STAT3. SD-36 potently induces the degradation of STAT3 protein in vitro and in vivo and demonstrates high selectivity over other STAT members. Induced degradation of STAT3 results in a strong suppression of its transcription network in leukemia and lymphoma cells. SD-36 inhibits the growth of a subset of acute myeloid leukemia and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma cell lines by inducing cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. SD-36 achieves complete and long-lasting tumor regression in multiple xenograft mouse models at well-tolerated dose schedules. Degradation of STAT3 protein, therefore, is a promising cancer therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
The current model of the organization of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) episodic memory system assumes that two functionally different “where” and “what” pathways enter MTL as parallel parahippocampal cortex (PHC)-medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and perirhinal cortex (PER)-lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) streams, respectively. With the use of tract tracing and in vitro electrophysiological recordings, we show that, in the rat LEC, all main principal neuron types in layer II receive convergent inputs from PER and postrhinal cortex (POR), homologous to PHC in primates. Projections to MEC from POR are much less prominent than previously assumed. These findings thus challenge the prevailing concept that LEC and MEC are defined by different inputs from the PER and PHC/POR, respectively. Our findings point to LEC as the main parahippocampal multimodal integrative structure whose unique set of external sensory-derived inputs allows its network to represent a continuously fluctuating extrinsic environment.

Abstract: Summary
Inconsistent activity limits the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in zebrafish. We show supernumerary guanine nucleotides at the 5′ ends of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) account for diminished CRISPR-Cas9 activity in zebrafish embryos. Genomic sequences can be targeted consistently with extremely high efficiency using Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) containing either a sgRNA molecule or a synthetic crRNA:tracrRNA duplex that perfectly matches the protospacer target site. Following injection of zebrafish eggs with such RNPs, virtually every copy of a targeted locus harbors an induced indel mutation. Loss of gene function is often complete, as F0 embryos closely resemble true null mutants without detectable non-specific effects. Mosaicism is sufficiently low in F0 embryos that cell non-autonomous gene functions can be probed effectively and redundant activities of genes can be uncovered when two genes are targeted simultaneously. Finally, heritable deletion mutations of at least 50 kbp can be readily induced using pairs of duplex guide RNPs targeted to a single chromosome.

Abstract: Summary
In addition to their support role in neurotransmitter and ion buffering, astrocytes directly regulate neurotransmission at synapses via local bidirectional signaling with neurons. Here, we reveal a form of neuronal-astrocytic signaling that transmits retrograde dendritic signals to distal upstream neurons in order to activate recurrent synaptic circuits. Norepinephrine activates α1 adrenoreceptors in hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons to stimulate dendritic release, which triggers an astrocytic calcium response and release of ATP; ATP stimulates action potentials in upstream glutamate and GABA neurons to activate recurrent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic circuits to the CRH neurons. Thus, norepinephrine activates a retrograde signaling mechanism in CRH neurons that engages astrocytes in order to extend dendritic volume transmission to reach distal presynaptic glutamate and GABA neurons, thereby amplifying volume transmission mediated by dendritic release.

Abstract: Summary
Fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FTSECs) are likely the main precursor cell type of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs), but these tumors may also arise from ovarian surface epithelial cells (OSECs). We profiled global landscapes of gene expression and active chromatin to characterize molecular similarities between OSECs (n = 114), FTSECs (n = 74), and HGSOCs (n = 394). A one-class machine learning algorithm predicts that most HGSOCs derive from FTSECs, with particularly high FTSEC scores in mesenchymal-type HGSOCs (padj < 8 × 10−4). However, a subset of HGSOCs likely derive from OSECs, particularly HGSOCs of the proliferative type (padj < 2 × 10−4), suggesting a dualistic model for HGSOC origins. Super-enhancer (SE) landscapes were also more similar between FTSECs and HGSOCs than between OSECs and HGSOCs (p < 2.2 × 10−16). The SOX18 transcription factor (TF) coincided with a HGSOC-specific SE, and ectopic overexpression of SOX18 in FTSECs caused epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, indicating that SOX18 plays a role in establishing the mesenchymal signature of fallopian-derived HGSOCs.

Abstract: Summary
While transcriptional control of innate immune gene expression is well characterized, almost nothing is known about how pre-mRNA splicing decisions influence, or are influenced by, macrophage activation. Here, we demonstrate that the splicing factor hnRNP M is a critical repressor of innate immune gene expression and that its function is regulated by pathogen sensing cascades. Loss of hnRNP M led to hyperinduction of a unique regulon of inflammatory and antimicrobial genes following diverse innate immune stimuli. While mutating specific serines on hnRNP M had little effect on its ability to control pre-mRNA splicing or transcript levels of housekeeping genes in resting macrophages, it greatly impacted the protein’s ability to dampen induction of specific innate immune transcripts following pathogen sensing. These data reveal a previously unappreciated role for pattern recognition receptor signaling in controlling splicing factor phosphorylation and establish pre-mRNA splicing as a critical regulatory node in defining innate immune outcomes.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in cancer progression, and, in ovarian cancer (OvCa), the primary TME is the omentum. Here, we show that the diabetes drug metformin alters mesothelial cells in the omental microenvironment. Metformin interrupts bidirectional signaling between tumor and mesothelial cells by blocking OvCa cell TGF-β signaling and mesothelial cell production of CCL2 and IL-8. Inhibition of tumor-stromal crosstalk by metformin is caused by the reduced expression of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) enzyme succinyl CoA ligase (SUCLG2). Through repressing this TCA enzyme and its metabolite, succinate, metformin activated prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), resulting in the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) in mesothelial cells. Disruption of HIF1α-driven IL-8 signaling in mesothelial cells by metformin results in reduced OvCa invasion in an organotypic 3D model. These findings indicate that tumor-promoting signaling between mesothelial and OvCa cells in the TME can be targeted using metformin.

Abstract: Summary
The protein-level translational status and function of many alternative splicing events remain poorly understood. We use an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-guided proteomics method to identify protein alternative splicing isoforms in the human proteome by constructing tissue-specific protein databases that prioritize transcript splice junction pairs with high translational potential. Using the custom databases to reanalyze ∼80 million mass spectra in public proteomics datasets, we identify more than 1,500 noncanonical protein isoforms across 12 human tissues, including ∼400 sequences undocumented on TrEMBL and RefSeq databases. We apply the method to original quantitative mass spectrometry experiments and observe widespread isoform regulation during human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocyte differentiation. On a proteome scale, alternative isoform regions overlap frequently with disordered sequences and post-translational modification sites, suggesting that alternative splicing may regulate protein function through modulating intrinsically disordered regions. The described approach may help elucidate functional consequences of alternative splicing and expand the scope of proteomics investigations in various systems.

Abstract: Summary
Intramuscular motor innervation is an essential process in neuromuscular development. Recently, mutations in COL25A1, encoding CLAC-P/collagen XXV, have been linked to the development of a congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder (CCDD). Yet the molecular mechanisms of intramuscular innervation and the etiology of CCDD related to COL25A1 have remained elusive. Here, we report that muscle-derived collagen XXV is indispensable for intramuscular innervation. In developing skeletal muscles, Col25a1 expression is tightly regulated by muscle excitation. In vitro and cell-based assays reveal a direct interaction between collagen XXV and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) σ and δ. Motor explant assays show that expression of collagen XXV in target cells attracts motor axons, but this is inhibited by exogenous PTPσ/δ. CCDD mutations attenuate motor axon attraction by reducing collagen XXV-PTPσ/δ interaction. Overall, our study identifies PTPσ/δ as putative receptors for collagen XXV, implicating collagen XXV and PTPσ/δ in intramuscular innervation and a developmental ocular motor disorder.

Abstract: Summary
Elucidating cell lineages provides crucial understanding of development. Recently developed sequencing-based techniques enhance the scale of lineage tracing but eliminate the spatial information offered by conventional approaches. Multi-spectral labeling techniques, such as Brainbow, have the potential to identify lineage-related cells in situ. Here, we report nuclear Bitbow (nBitbow), a “digital” version of Brainbow that greatly expands the color diversity for scoring cells, and a suite of statistical methods for quantifying the lineage relationship of any two cells. Applying these tools to the Drosophila peripheral nervous system (PNS), we determined lineage relationship between all neuronal pairs. This study demonstrates nBitbow as an efficient tool for in situ lineage mapping, and the complete lineage relationship among larval PNS neurons opens new possibilities for studying how neurons gain specific features and circuit connectivity.

Abstract: Summary
When the core body temperature is higher than 40°C, life is threatened due to heatstroke. Tumor repressor p53 is required for heat-induced apoptosis at hyperthermia conditions (>41°C). However, its role in sub-heatstroke conditions (≤40°C) remains unclear. Here, we reveal that both zebrafish and human p53 promote survival at 40°C, the heatstroke threshold temperature, by preventing a hyperreactive heat shock response (HSR). At 40°C, both Hsf1 and Hsp90 are activated. Hsf1 upregulates the expression of Hsc70 to trigger Hsc70-mediated protein degradation, whereas Hsp90 stabilizes p53 to repress the expression of Hsf1 and Hsc70, which prevents excessive HSR to maintain cell homeostasis. Under hyperthermia conditions, ATM is activated to phosphorylate p53 at S37, which increases BAX expression to induce apoptosis. Furthermore, growth of p53-deficient tumor xenografts, but not that of their p53+/+ counterparts, was inhibited by 40°C treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Non-recirculating tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) are the predominant T cell subset in diverse tissue sites, where they mediate protective immune responses in situ. Here, we reveal a role for TRM in maintaining immune homeostasis in the human pancreas through interactions with resident macrophages and the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway. Using tissues obtained from organ donors, we identify that pancreas T cells comprise CD8+PD-1hi TRMs, which are phenotypically, functionally, and transcriptionally distinct compared to TRMs in neighboring jejunum and lymph node sites. Pancreas TRMs cluster with resident macrophages throughout the exocrine areas; TRM effector functions are enhanced by macrophage-derived co-stimulation and attenuated by the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways. Conversely, in samples from chronic pancreatitis, TRMs exhibit reduced PD-1 expression and reduced interactions with macrophages. These findings suggest important roles for PD-1 and TRM-macrophage interactions in controlling tissue homeostasis and immune dysfunctions underlying inflammatory disease, with important implications for PD-1-based immunotherapies.

Abstract: Summary
Uveal melanoma (UM), the most common ocular malignancy, is characterized by GNAQ/11 mutations. Hippo/YAP and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) emerge as two important signaling pathways downstream of G protein alpha subunits of the Q class (GαQ/11)-mediated transformation, although whether and how they contribute to UM genesis in vivo remain unclear. Here, we adapt an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based ocular injection method to directly deliver Cre recombinase into the mouse uveal tract and demonstrate that Lats1/2 kinases suppress UM formation specifically in uveal melanocytes. We find that genetic activation of YAP, but not Kras, is sufficient to initiate UM. We show that YAP/TAZ activation induced by Lats1/2 deletion cooperates with Kras to promote UM progression via downstream transcriptional reinforcement. Furthermore, dual inhibition of YAP/TAZ and Ras/MAPK synergizes to suppress oncogenic growth of human UM cells. Our data highlight the functional significance of Lats-YAP/TAZ in UM initiation and progression in vivo and suggest combination inhibition of YAP/TAZ and Ras/MAPK as a new therapeutic strategy for UM.

Abstract: Summary
Optogenetic stimulation of inhibitory interneurons has become a commonly used strategy for silencing neuronal activity. This is typically achieved using transgenic mice expressing excitatory opsins in inhibitory interneurons throughout the brain, raising the question of how spatially extensive the resulting inhibition is. Here, we characterize neuronal silencing in VGAT-ChR2 mice, which express channelrhodopsin-2 in inhibitory interneurons, as a function of light intensity and distance from the light source in several cortical and subcortical regions. We show that light stimulation, even at relatively low intensities, causes inhibition not only in brain regions targeted for silencing but also in their subjacent areas. In contrast, virus-mediated expression of an inhibitory opsin enables robust silencing that is restricted to the region of opsin expression. Our results reveal important constraints on using inhibitory interneuron activation to silence neuronal activity and emphasize the necessity of carefully controlling light stimulation parameters when using this silencing strategy.

Abstract: Summary
A growing body of evidence suggests that changes in fat metabolism may have a significant effect on lifespan. Accumulation of lipid deposits in non-adipose tissue appears to be critical for age-related pathologies and may also contribute to the aging process itself. We established a model of lipid storage in muscle cells of C. elegans to reveal a mechanism that promotes longevity non-cell-autonomously. Here, we describe how muscle-specific activation of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) ortholog IPLA-7 collectively affect inter-tissular communication and systemic adaptation that requires the activity of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) and a highly conserved nuclear receptor outside of the muscle. Our data suggest that muscle-specific bioactive lipid signals, or “lipokines,” are generated following triglyceride breakdown and that these signals impinge on a complex network of genes that modify the global lipidome, consequently extending the lifespan.

Abstract: Summary
Integrin receptors coordinate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) to facilitate many cellular processes during malignant transformation. Despite their pro-tumorigenic roles, therapies targeting integrins remain limited. Here, we provide genetic evidence supporting a functional redundancy between β1 and β3 integrin during breast cancer progression. Although ablation of β1 or β3 integrin alone has limited effects on ErbB2-driven mammary tumorigenesis, deletion of both receptors resulted in a significant delay in tumor onset with a corresponding impairment in lung metastasis. Mechanistically, stiff ECM cooperates with integrin receptors to recruit insulin receptors (IRs) to focal adhesion through the formation of integrin/IR complexes, thereby preventing their lysosomal degradation. β1/β3 integrin-deficient tumors that eventually emerged exhibit impaired Akt/mTORC1 activity. Murine and human breast cancers exhibiting enhanced integrin-dependent activity also display elevated IR/Akt/mTORC1 signaling activity. Together, these observations argue that integrin/IR crosstalk transduces mechanical cues from the tumor microenvironment to promote ErbB2-dependent breast cancer progression.

Abstract: Summary
B cell development depends on the coordinated expression and cooperation of several transcription factors. Here we show that the transcription factor ETS-related gene (ERG) is crucial for normal B cell development and that its deletion results in a substantial loss of bone marrow B cell progenitors and peripheral B cells, as well as a skewing of splenic B cell populations. We find that ERG-deficient B lineage cells exhibit an early developmental block at the pre-B cell stage and proliferate less. The cells fail to express the immunoglobulin heavy chain due to inefficient V-to-DJ recombination, and cells that undergo recombination display a strong bias against incorporation of distal V gene segments. Furthermore, antisense transcription at PAX5-activated intergenic repeat (PAIR) elements, located in the distal region of the Igh locus, depends on ERG. These findings show that ERG serves as a critical regulator of B cell development by ensuring efficient and balanced V-to-DJ recombination.

Abstract: Summary
Reduced expression of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein causes the neurodegenerative disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Here, we show that adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-mediated delivery of Stasimon—a gene encoding an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein regulated by SMN—improves motor function in a mouse model of SMA through multiple mechanisms. In proprioceptive neurons, Stasimon overexpression prevents the loss of afferent synapses on motor neurons and enhances sensory-motor neurotransmission. In motor neurons, Stasimon suppresses neurodegeneration by reducing phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor p53. Moreover, Stasimon deficiency converges on SMA-related mechanisms of p53 upregulation to induce phosphorylation of p53 through activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and pharmacological inhibition of this kinase prevents motor neuron death in SMA mice. These findings identify Stasimon dysfunction induced by SMN deficiency as an upstream driver of distinct cellular cascades that lead to synaptic loss and motor neuron degeneration, revealing a dual contribution of Stasimon to motor circuit pathology in SMA.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular basis of higher regenerative capacity of cold-blooded animals comparing to warm-blooded ones is poorly understood. Although this difference in regenerative capacities is commonly thought to be a result of restructuring of the same regulatory gene network, we hypothesized that it may be due to loss of some genes essential for regeneration. We describe here a bioinformatic method that allowed us to identify such genes. For investigation in depth we selected one of them encoding transmembrane protein, named “c-Answer.” Using the Xenopus laevis frog as a model cold-blooded animal, we established that c-Answer regulates regeneration of body appendages and telencephalic development through binding to fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) and P2ry1 receptors and promoting MAPK/ERK and purinergic signaling. This suggests that elimination of c-answer in warm-blooded animals could lead to decreased activity of at least two signaling pathways, which in turn might contribute to changes in mechanisms regulating regeneration and telencephalic development.

Abstract: Summary
Cytotoxic immunoglobulin G antibodies are an essential component of therapeutic approaches aimed at depleting self-reactive or malignant cells. More recent evidence suggests that the tissue in which the target cell resides influences the underlying molecular and cellular pathways responsible for cytotoxic antibody activity. By studying cytotoxic IgG activity directed against natural killer cells in primary and secondary immunological organs, we show that distinct organ-specific effector pathways are responsible for target cell depletion. While in the bone marrow, the classical complement pathway and the high-affinity Fcγ-receptor I expressed on organ-resident macrophages were both involved in removing opsonized target cells; in the spleen and blood, all activating FcγRs but not the classical complement pathway were critical for target cell killing. Our study suggests that future strategies aimed at optimizing overall cytotoxic antibody activity may need to consider organ-specific pathways to achieve a maximal therapeutic effect.

Abstract: Summary
Attachment of palmitate to the N terminus of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is essential for Shh signaling. Shh palmitoylation is catalyzed on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by Hedgehog acyltransferase (Hhat), an ER-resident enzyme. Palmitoyl-coenzyme A (CoA), the palmitate donor, is produced in the cytosol and is not permeable across membrane bilayers. It is not known how palmitoyl-CoA crosses the ER membrane to access the active site of Hhat. Here, we use fluorescent and radiolabeled palmitoyl-CoA probes to demonstrate that Hhat promotes the uptake of palmitoyl-CoA across the ER membrane in microsomes and semi-intact cells. Reconstitution of purified Hhat into liposomes provided further evidence that palmitoyl-CoA uptake activity is an intrinsic property of Hhat. Palmitoyl-CoA uptake was regulated by and could be uncoupled from Hhat enzymatic activity, implying that Hhat serves a dual function as a palmitoyl acyltransferase and a conduit to supply palmitoyl-CoA to the luminal side of the ER.

Abstract: Summary
Pathological aggregation of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) is associated with dysregulation of RNA splicing in PS19 P301S tau transgenic mice and in Alzheimer’s disease brain tissues. The dysregulated splicing particularly affects genes involved in synaptic transmission. The effects of neuroprotective TIA1 reduction on PS19 mice are also examined. TIA1 reduction reduces disease-linked alternative splicing events for the major synaptic mRNA transcripts examined, suggesting that normalization of RBP functions is associated with the neuroprotection. Use of the NetDecoder informatics algorithm identifies key upstream biological targets, including MYC and EGFR, underlying the transcriptional and splicing changes in the protected compared to tauopathy mice. Pharmacological inhibition of MYC and EGFR activity in neuronal cultures tau recapitulates the neuroprotective effects of TIA1 reduction. These results demonstrate that dysfunction of RBPs and RNA splicing processes are major elements of the pathophysiology of tauopathies, as well as potential therapeutic targets for tauopathies.

Abstract: Summary
Sex differences in autoimmunity and infection suggest that a better understanding of molecular sex differences will improve the diagnosis and treatment of immune-related disease. We identified 144 differentially expressed genes, referred to as immune sex expression signature (iSEXS), between human males and females using an integrated multi-cohort analysis of blood transcriptome profiles from six discovery cohorts from five continents with 458 healthy individuals. We validated iSEXS in 11 additional cohorts of 524 peripheral blood samples. When we separated iSEXS into genes located on sex chromosomes (XY-iSEXS) or autosomes (autosomal-iSEXS), both modules distinguished males and females. iSEXS reflects sex differences in immune cell proportions, with female-associated genes showing higher expression by CD4+ T cells and male-associated genes showing higher expression by myeloid cells. Autosomal-iSEXS detected an increase in monocytes with age in females, reflected sex-differential immune cell dynamics during influenza infection, and predicted antibody response in males, but not females.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor-suppressive transcription factor p53 is a master regulator of stress responses. In non-stressed conditions, p53 is maintained at low levels by the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 and its binding partner Mdmx. Mdmx depletion leads to a biphasic p53 response, with an initial post-mitotic pulse followed by oscillations. The mechanism underlying this dynamical behavior is unknown. Two different roles for Mdmx have been proposed: enhancing p53 ubiquitination by Mdm2 and inhibiting p53 activity. Here, we developed a mathematical model of the p53/Mdm2/Mdmx network to investigate which Mdmx functions quantitatively affect specific features of p53 dynamics under various conditions. We found that enhancement of Mdm2 activity was the most critical role of Mdmx under unstressed conditions. The model also accurately predicted p53 dynamics in Mdmx-depleted cells following DNA damage. This work outlines a strategy for rapidly testing possible network interactions to reveal those most impactful in regulating the dynamics of key proteins.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (plasmacytoid DC, pDC) are major IFN-I producers and have been shown to be affected by HIV through ill-defined mechanisms. In this study, we directly assess the role of pDC in early infection, evaluating whether modulating their abundance can alter viral replication. First, HIV infection of humanized mice induces systemic depletion of pDC, and in the presence of soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), pDC levels remain elevated. Flt3L significantly delays the onset of viremia and reduces viral replication via a process that is dependent on pDC and mediated through an enhanced early IFN-I response. pDC from Flt3L-treated mice are more prone to express IFN-α following TLR7 stimulation, but this propensity is gradually decreased during infection. In conclusion, maintaining pDC levels and function is key to effective early viral control, and in this context, these findings provide practical insights for anti-HIV strategies and vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell-derived neurons are generally obtained in mass cultures that lack both spatial organization and any meaningful connectivity. We implement a microfluidic system for long-term culture of human neurons with patterned projections and synaptic terminals. Co-culture of human midbrain dopaminergic and striatal medium spiny neurons on the microchip establishes an orchestrated nigro-striatal circuitry with functional dopaminergic synapses. We use this platform to dissect the mitochondrial dysfunctions associated with a genetic form of Parkinson’s disease (PD) with OPA1 mutations. Remarkably, we find that axons of OPA1 mutant dopaminergic neurons exhibit a significant reduction of mitochondrial mass. This defect causes a significant loss of dopaminergic synapses, which worsens in long-term cultures. Therefore, PD-associated depletion of mitochondria at synapses might precede loss of neuronal connectivity and neurodegeneration. In vitro reconstitution of human circuitries by microfluidic technology offers a powerful system to study brain networks by establishing ordered neuronal compartments and correct synapse identity.
