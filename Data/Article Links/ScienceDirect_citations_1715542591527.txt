Abstract: Summary
Prior immunological exposure to dengue virus can be both protective and disease-enhancing during subsequent infections with different dengue virus serotypes. We provide here a systematic, longitudinal analysis of B cell, T cell, and antibody responses in the same patients. Antibody responses as well as T and B cell activation differentiate primary from secondary responses. Hospitalization is associated with lower frequencies of activated, terminally differentiated T cells and higher percentages of effector memory CD4 T cells. Patients with more severe disease tend to have higher percentages of plasmablasts. This does not translate into long-term antibody titers, since neutralizing titers after 6 months correlate with percentages of specific memory B cells, but not with acute plasmablast activation. Overall, our unbiased analysis reveals associations between cellular profiles and disease severity, opening opportunities to study immunopathology in dengue disease and the potential predictive value of these parameters.

Abstract: The present study aimed to investigate the differential response of oxidative (soleus) and glycolytic (gastrocnemius) muscles to heat-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. It was hypothesized that due to compositional and functional differences, both muscles respond differently to acute heat stress. To address this, male Sprague Dawley rats (12/group) were subjected to thermoneutral (25 °C) or heat stress (42 °C) conditions for 1 h. Soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were removed for analysis post-exposure. A significant increase in body temperature and free radical generation was observed in both the muscles following heat exposure. This further caused a significant increase in protein carbonyl content, AOPP, and lipid peroxidation in heat-stressed muscles. These changes were more pronounced in heat-stressed soleus compared to the gastrocnemius muscle. Accumulation of unfolded, denatured proteins results in ER stress, causing activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. The expressions of UPR transducers were significantly higher in soleus as compared to the gastrocnemius muscle. A significant elevation in resting intracellular calcium ion was also observed in heat-stressed soleus muscle. Overloading of cells with misfolded proteins in soleus muscle activated ER-induced apoptosis as indicated by significant upregulation of C/EBP homologous protein and Caspase12. The study provides a detailed mechanistic representation of the differential response of muscles toward UPR under heat stress. Data suggests that soleus majorly being an oxidative muscle is more prone to heat stress-induced insult indicated by enhanced apoptosis. This study may aid in devising mitigation strategies to improve muscle performance under heat stress.

Abstract: Summary
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could impair recognition of the virus by human antibody-mediated immunity. To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent plasma antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spike’s receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of plasma neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal plasma antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in the RBD, but longitudinal samples reveal that the impact of these mutations on antibody binding varies substantially both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBD’s receptor-binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some plasma is reduced >10-fold by several mutations, including one in the emerging 20H/501Y.V2 and 20J/501Y.V3 SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Going forward, these plasma escape maps can inform surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Attachment of the ubiquitin (UB) peptide to proteins via the E1-E2-E3 enzymatic machinery regulates diverse biological pathways, yet identification of the substrates of E3 UB ligases remains a challenge. We overcame this challenge by constructing an “orthogonal UB transfer” (OUT) cascade with yeast E3 Rsp5 to enable the exclusive delivery of an engineered UB (xUB) to Rsp5 and its substrate proteins. The OUT screen uncovered new Rsp5 substrates in yeast, such as Pal1 and Pal2, which are partners of endocytic protein Ede1, and chaperones Hsp70-Ssb, Hsp82, and Hsp104 that counteract protein misfolding and control self-perpetuating amyloid aggregates (prions), resembling those involved in human amyloid diseases. We showed that prion formation and effect of Hsp104 on prion propagation are modulated by Rsp5. Overall, our work demonstrates the capacity of OUT to deconvolute the complex E3-substrate relationships in crucial biological processes such as endocytosis and protein assembly disorders through protein ubiquitination.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus commonly infects the skin, but the host-pathogen interactions controlling bacterial growth remain unclear. S. aureus virulence is regulated by the Agr quorum-sensing system that controls factors including phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), a group of cytotoxic peptides. We found a differential requirement for Agr and PSMα for pathogen growth in the skin. In neutrophil-deficient mice, S. aureus growth on the epidermis was unaffected, but the pathogen penetrated the dermis through mechanisms that require PSMα. In the dermis, pathogen expansion required Agr in wild-type mice, but not in neutrophil-deficient mice. Agr limited oxidative and non-oxidative killing in neutrophils by inhibiting pathogen late endosome localization and promoting phagosome escape. Unlike Agr, the SaeR/S virulence program was dispensable for growth in the epidermis and promoted dermal pathogen expansion independently of neutrophils. Thus, S. aureus growth and invasion are differentially regulated with Agr limiting intracellular killing within neutrophils to promote pathogen expansion in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Emerging evidence indicates the involvement of O-GlcNAc modification in placental development and pregnant health through mechanisms that are not well understood. Herein, by applying the quantitative O-GlcNAc proteomics, we established a database of O-GlcNAcylated proteins in human placental trophoblasts. Hundreds of proteins that were dynamically O-GlcNAcylated during trophoblast differentiation were identified, among which cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) exhibited the most significant change. Site-specific analysis by mass spectrometry revealed Ser138 as the core O-GlcNAc site in CSE, and its O-GlcNAcylation promoted the enzymatic activity to produce H2S, which in turn repressed trophoblast differentiation via inhibiting androgen receptor dimerization. Consistently, in preeclamptic placentas, remarkably enhanced CSE O-GlcNAcylation and H2S production were associated with restricted trophoblast differentiation. The findings establish a resource of O-GlcNAc dynamics in human placenta, and provide a deeper insight into the biological significance of O-GlcNAcylation in placental development as well as potential therapeutic targets for the relevant pregnant complications.

Abstract: Summary
Metastasis is the major cause of cancer-related death, but whether metastatic lesions exhibit the same cellular composition as primary tumors has yet to be elucidated. To investigate the cellular heterogeneity of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), we established 72 patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from 21 patients. Combined bulk transcriptomic and single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed decreased gene expression of markers for differentiated cells in PDOs derived from metastatic lesions. Paradoxically, expression of potential intestinal stem cell markers was also decreased. We identified OLFM4 as the gene most strongly correlating with a stem-like cell cluster, and found OLFM4+ cells to be capable of initiating organoid culture growth and differentiation capacity in primary PDOs. These cells were required for the efficient growth of primary PDOs but dispensable for metastatic PDOs. These observations demonstrate that metastatic lesions have a cellular composition distinct from that of primary tumors; patient-matched PDOs are a useful resource for analyzing metastatic CRC.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance and self-renewal of the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) population is the cornerstone of male fertility. Here, we have identified a key role for the nucleosome remodeling protein CHD4 in regulating SSC function. Gene expression analyses revealed that CHD4 expression is highly enriched in the SSC population in the mouse testis. Using spermatogonial transplantation techniques it was established that loss of Chd4 expression significantly impairs SSC regenerative capacity, causing a ∼50% reduction in colonization of recipient testes. An scRNA-seq comparison revealed reduced expression of “self-renewal” genes following Chd4 knockdown, along with increased expression of signature progenitor genes. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that CHD4 regulates gene expression in spermatogonia not only through its traditional association with the remodeling complex NuRD, but also via interaction with the GDNF-responsive transcription factor SALL4. Cumulatively, the results of this study depict a previously unappreciated role for CHD4 in controlling fate decisions in the spermatogonial pool.

Abstract: Summary
Enteroviruses, such as EV-A71 and CVA16, mainly infect the human gastrointestinal tract. Human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, have been variably associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. We aimed to optimize the human intestinal organoids and hypothesize that these optimized intestinal organoids can recapitulate enteric infections of enterovirus and coronavirus. We demonstrate that the optimized human intestinal organoids enable better simulation of the native human intestinal epithelium, and that they are significantly more susceptible to EV-A71 than CVA16. Higher replication of EV-A71 than CVA16 in the intestinal organoids triggers a more vigorous cellular response. However, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit distinct dynamics of virus-host interaction; more robust propagation of SARS-CoV triggers minimal cellular response, whereas, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits lower replication capacity but elicits a moderate cellular response. Taken together, the disparate profile of the virus-host interaction of enteroviruses and coronaviruses in human intestinal organoids may unravel the cellular basis of the distinct pathogenicity of these viral pathogens.

Abstract: Summary
Lineage tracing is a powerful tool in developmental biology to interrogate the evolution of tissue formation, but the dense, three-dimensional nature of tissue limits the assembly of individual cell trajectories into complete reconstructions of development. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can recapitulate aspects of developmental processes, providing an in vitro platform to assess the dynamic collective behaviors directing tissue morphogenesis. Here, we trained an ensemble of neural networks to track individual hiPSCs in time-lapse microscopy, generating longitudinal measures of cell and cellular neighborhood properties on timescales from minutes to days. Our analysis reveals that, while individual cell parameters are not strongly affected by pluripotency maintenance conditions or morphogenic cues, regional changes in cell behavior predict cell fate and colony organization. By generating complete multicellular reconstructions of hiPSC behavior, our tracking pipeline enables fine-grained understanding of morphogenesis by elucidating the role of regional behavior in early tissue formation.

Abstract: Summary
We previously tested HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in immunocompromised (SCID) mice, precluding evaluation of host immunity, impact on cancer stem cells (CSCs), and potential benefit when combined with PD-L1 blockade. In this study, we tested HER2-targeted ADC in two immunocompetent mouse tumor models. HER2-targeted ADC specifically inhibited the growth of HER2-expressing tumors, prolonged animal survival, and reduced HER2+ and PD-L1+ cells. ADC + anti-PD-L1 antibody augmented therapeutic efficacy, modulated immune gene signatures, increased the number and function of CD3+ and CD19+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), induced tumor antigen-specific immunological memory, stimulated B cell activation, differentiation, and IgG1 production both systemically and in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, ADC therapy modulated T cell subsets and their activation in TILs. Furthermore, HER2-targeted ADC reduced the number and tumorigenicity of ALDHhi CSCs. This study demonstrates that HER2-targeted ADC effectively targets ALDHhi CSCs and this effect is augmented by co-administration of anti-PD-L1 antibody.

Abstract: Proinflammatory molecule tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is predominantly elevated in cytokine storm as well as worsening cardiac function. Here we model the molecular and functional effects of TNF-α in cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). We found that treatment of hiPSC-CMs with TNF-α increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase 3/7 activity and caused cell death and apoptosis. TNF-α treatment also resulted in dysregulation of cardiomyocyte function with respect to the increased abnormal calcium handling, calcium wave propagation between cells and excitation–contraction coupling. We also uncovered significant changes in gene expression and protein localization caused by TNF-α treatment. Notably, TNF-α treatment altered the expression of ion channels, dysregulated cadherins, and affected the localization of gap-junction protein connexin-43. In addition, TNF-α treatment up-regulated IL-32 (a human specific cytokine, not present in rodents and an inducer of TNF-α) and IL-34 and down-regulated glutamate receptors and cardiomyocyte contractile proteins. These findings provide insights into the molecular and functional consequences from the exposure of human cardiomyocytes to TNF-α. Our study provides a model to incorporate inflammatory factors into hiPSC-CM-based studies to evaluate mechanistic aspects of heart disease.

Abstract: Summary
The gut is inhabited by a densely populated ecosystem, the gut microbiota, that is established at birth. However, the succession by which different bacteria are incorporated into the gut microbiota is still relatively unknown. Here, we analyze the microbiota from 471 Swedish children followed from birth to 5 years of age, collecting samples after 4 and 12 months and at 3 and 5 years of age as well as from their mothers at birth using 16S rRNA gene profiling. We also compare their microbiota to an adult Swedish population. Genera follow 4 different colonization patterns during establishment where Methanobrevibacter and Christensenellaceae colonize late and do not reached adult levels at 5 years. These late colonizers correlate with increased alpha diversity in both children and adults. By following the children through age-specific community types, we observe that children have individual dynamics in the gut microbiota development trajectory.

Abstract: Adenylate kinase 6 (AK6), a nucleus localized phosphotransferase in mammalians, shows ubiquitously expression and broad substrate activity in different tissues and cell types. Although the function of AK6 has been extensively studied in different cancer cell lines, its role in mammalian germline is still unknown. Here we showed that knockdown of AK6 inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis in human testicular carcinoma (NT2 cells). Co-immunoprecipitation experiment and in vitro pull down assay identified WNK1 (with no lysine kinase-1) as one of the AK6 interacting proteins in NT2 cells. Moreover, we found that AK6 regulates the phosphorylation states of WNK1 (Thr60) and affects phosphorylation level of Akt (Ser473) upon hypotonic condition, probably affecting chloride channel and regulating ion transport and homeostasis in NT2 cells and consequently contributing to the decreased cell proliferation rate. In conclusion, AK6 regulates WNK1 phosphorylation states and affects ion homeostasis in NT2 cells. These findings provide new insights into the function of AK6 and WNK1 in human testicular carcinoma. This work also provides foundation for further mechanism study of AK6 in spermatogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Heat shock protein (Hsp90), a critical molecular chaperone that regulates the maturation of a large number of oncogenic client proteins, plays an essential role in the growth of neoplastic cells. Herein, DDO-6600 is identified to covalent modification of Cys598 on Hsp90 from in silico study and is verified by a series of biological assays. We demonstrated that DDO-6600 covalently bound to Cys598 on the Hsp90 C terminus and exhibited antiproliferative activities against multiple tumor cells without inhibiting ATPase activity. Further studies showed that DDO-6600 disrupted the interaction between Hsp90 and Cdc37, which induced the degradation of kinase client proteins in multiple tumor cell lines, promoted apoptosis, and inhibited cell motility. Our findings offer mechanic insights into the covalent modification of Hsp90 and provide an alternative strategy for the development of Hsp90 covalent regulators or chemical probes to explore the therapeutical potential of Hsp90.

Abstract: Summary
BRCA2 controls RAD51 recombinase during homologous DNA recombination (HDR) through eight evolutionarily conserved BRC repeats, which individually engage RAD51 via the motif Phe-x-x-Ala. Using structure-guided molecular design, templated on a monomeric thermostable chimera between human RAD51 and archaeal RadA, we identify CAM833, a 529 Da orthosteric inhibitor of RAD51:BRC with a Kd of 366 nM. The quinoline of CAM833 occupies a hotspot, the Phe-binding pocket on RAD51 and the methyl of the substituted α-methylbenzyl group occupies the Ala-binding pocket. In cells, CAM833 diminishes formation of damage-induced RAD51 nuclear foci; inhibits RAD51 molecular clustering, suppressing extended RAD51 filament assembly; potentiates cytotoxicity by ionizing radiation, augmenting 4N cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death and works with poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)1 inhibitors to suppress growth in BRCA2-wildtype cells. Thus, chemical inhibition of the protein-protein interaction between BRCA2 and RAD51 disrupts HDR and potentiates DNA damage-induced cell death, with implications for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The eye is highly susceptible to inflammation-mediated tissue damage evoked during bacterial infection. However, mechanisms regulating inflammation to protect the eye remain elusive. Here, we used integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics to show that the immunomodulatory metabolite itaconate and immune-responsive gene 1 (Irg1) are induced in bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus)-infected mouse eyes, bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), and Müller glia. Itaconate levels are also elevated in the vitreous of patients with bacterial endophthalmitis. Irg1 deficiency in mice led to increased ocular pathology. Conversely, intraocular administration of itaconate protects both Irg1−/− and wild-type mice from bacterial endophthalmitis by reducing inflammation, bacterial burden, and preserving retinal architecture and visual function. Notably, itaconate exerts synergistic effects with antibiotics. The protective, anti-inflammatory effects of itaconate are mediated via activation of NRF2/HO-1 signaling and inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome. Collectively, our study demonstrates the Irg1/itaconate axis is a regulator of intraocular inflammation and provides evidence for using itaconate, along with antibiotics, to treat bacterial infections.

Abstract: The Korea National Stem Cell Bank has been banking pluripotent stem cell (PSC) lines since 2012. Quality-controlled and ethically sourced cell lines were developed for distribution. Currently (as of 2020), among the 69 deposited lines, 4 research-grade human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines and 19 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines have been distributed. Good manufacturing practices (GMP)-compliant homozygous iPSC lines for regenerative medicine with homozygous HLA haplotypes that cover 51% of the Korean population have been deposited as well. To ensure the quality of the cell lines, we performed eighteen different quality tests on the identity, sterility, consistency, stability and safety of the cell lines. Regarding genetic stability, we are collecting SNPchip, WES, Methyl-seq, and RNA-seq data, which are open to the public.

Abstract: Summary
Total thyroidectomy as part of thyroid cancer treatment results in hypothyroidism requiring lifelong daily thyroid hormone replacement. Unbalanced hormone levels result in persistent complaints such as fatigue, constipation, and weight increase. Therefore, we aimed to investigate a patient-derived thyroid organoid model with the potential to regenerate the thyroid gland. Murine and human thyroid-derived cells were cultured as organoids capable of self-renewal and which expressed proliferation and putative stem cell and thyroid characteristics, without a change in the expression of thyroid tumor-related genes. These organoids formed thyroid-tissue-resembling structures in culture. (Xeno-)transplantation of 600,000 dispersed organoid cells underneath the kidney capsule of a hypothyroid mouse model resulted in the generation of hormone-producing thyroid-resembling follicles. This study provides evidence that thyroid-lineage-specific cells can form organoids that are able to self-renew and differentiate into functional thyroid tissue. Subsequent (xeno-)transplantation of these thyroid organoids demonstrates a proof of principle for functional miniature gland formation.

Abstract: The transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) can principally serve a mode of protection for both the normal cells and cancer cells from cellular stress, and elevates cancer cell survival. microRNA-28 (miR-28) has been involved in the regulation of Nrf2 expression in breast epithelial cells. However, no comprehensive analysis has been conducted regarding the function of miR-28-5p regulating Nrf2 in gastric cancer (GC). In this study, we aimed to evaluate their interaction and biological roles in the migration and invasion of GC cells. The expression of Nrf2 in the cancer tissues harvested from 42 patients with GC was examined by an array of molecular techniques comprising of Immunohistochemical staining, RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Kaplan-Meier method was adopted for analysis of the correlation of Nrf2 with the prognosis of GC patients. Interaction between miR-28-5p and Nrf2 was determined using the bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Gain- and loss-of-function studies of miR-28-5p and Nrf2 were conducted to elucidate their effects on GC cell migration, invasion and metastasis, as well as expression pattern of several epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. Results indicated that the expression pattern of Nrf2 was significantly upregulated in GC tissues and indicative of poor prognosis of GC patients. miR-28-5p was verified to target Nrf2 and downregulate its expression. GC cells with overexpression of miR-28-5p or Nrf2 knockdown exhibited a marked reduction in the migrated and invasive abilities, along with the N-cadherin expression yet an increase of E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, miR-28-5p exerted an inhibitory function on the metastatic and tumorigenicity of GC cells. In conclusion, miR-28-5p is a comprehensive tumor suppressor that inhibits GC cell migration and invasion through repressing the Nrf2 expression. Therefore, miR-28-5p may serve as a potential biomarker for the prognosis of GC and a novel therapeutic target in advanced GC.

Abstract: Summary
Loss-of-function mutations in the forkhead box N1 (FOXN1) gene lead to nude severe combined immunodeficiency, a rare inherited syndrome characterized by athymia, severe T cell immunodeficiency, congenital alopecia, and nail dystrophy. We recently produced FOXN1 mutant nude rabbits (NuRabbits) by using CRISPR-Cas9. Here we report the establishment and maintenance of the NuRabbit colony. NuRabbits, like nude mice, are hairless, lack thymic development, and are immunodeficient. To demonstrate the functional applications of NuRabbits in biomedical research, we show that they can successfully serve as the recipient animals in xenotransplantation experiments using human induced pluripotent stem cells or tissue-engineered blood vessels. Our work presents the NuRabbit as a new member of the immunodeficient animal model family. The relatively large size and long lifespan of NuRabbits offer unique applications in regenerative medicine, cancer research, and the study of a variety of other human conditions, including immunodeficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Hantaviruses are zoonotic RNA viruses that cause severe acute disease in humans. Infected individuals have strong inflammatory responses that likely cause immunopathology. Here, we studied the response of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in peripheral blood of individuals with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Puumala orthohantavirus, a hantavirus endemic in Europe. We show that MAIT cell levels decrease in the blood during HFRS and that residual MAIT cells are highly activated. This activation correlates with HFRS severity markers. In vitro activation of MAIT cells by hantavirus-exposed antigen-presenting cells is dependent on type I interferons (IFNs) and independent of interleukin-18 (IL-18). These findings highlight the role of type I IFNs in virus-driven MAIT cell activation and suggest a potential role of MAIT cells in the disease pathogenesis of viral infections.

Abstract: Prion protein (PrP) adopts either a helical conformation (PrPC) or an alternative, beta sheet-rich, misfolded conformation (PrPSc). The PrPSc form has the ability to “infect” PrPC and force it into the misfolded state. Accumulation of PrPSc is associated with a number of lethal neurodegenerative disorders, including Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD). Knockout of PrPC protects cells and animals from PrPSc infection; thus, there is interest in identifying factors that regulate PrPC stability, with the therapeutic goal of reducing PrPC levels and limiting infection by PrPSc. Here, we assembled a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) library composed of 25+ shRNA sequences for each of 133 protein homeostasis (aka proteostasis) factors, such as molecular chaperones and co-chaperones. This Proteostasis shRNA Library was used to identify regulators of PrPC stability in HEK293 Hu129M cells. Strikingly, the screen identified a number of Hsp70 family members and their co-chaperones as putative targets. Indeed, a chemical pan-inhibitor of Hsp70s reduced PrPC levels and limited conversion to PrPSc in N2a cells. These results implicate specific proteostasis sub-networks, especially the Hsp70 system, as potential new targets for the treatment of CJD. More broadly, the Proteostasis shRNA Library might be a useful tool for asking which proteostasis factors are important for a given protein.

Abstract: The metabolic enzyme CTP synthase (CTPS) can form filamentous structures named cytoophidia in numerous types of cells, including follicle cells. However, the regulation of cytoophidium assembly remains elusive. The apicobasal polarity, a defining characteristic of Drosophila follicle epithelium, is established and regulated by a variety of membrane domains. Here we show that CTPS can form cytoophidia in Drosophila epithelial follicle cells. Cytoophidia localise to the basolateral side of follicle cells. If apical polarity regulators are knocked down, cytoophidia become unstable and distribute abnormally. Knockdown of basolateral polarity regulators has no significant effect on cytoophidia, even though the polarity is disturbed. Our results indicate that cytoophidia are maintained via polarised distribution on the basolateral side of Drosophila follicle epithelia, which is primarily achieved through the apical polarity regulators.

Abstract: Purpose
Femoral head necrosis (FHN) is a common disease of hip. However, the pathogenesis of FHN is not well understood. This study attempted to explore the potentially important genes and proteins involved in FHN.
Methods
We integrated the transcriptomic and proteomic methods to quantitatively screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and proteins (DEPs) between Control and FHN groups. Gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were used to assess the roles of DEGs and DEPs. qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to verify the key genes/proteins in FHN. CCK-8 assay was performed to measure cell viability. The protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 were used to evaluate cell apoptosis.
Results
Transcriptome and proteome studies indicated 758 DEGs and 1097 DEPs between Control and FHN groups, respectively. Cell division, extracellular exosome, and serine-type endopeptidase activity were the most common terms in biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) enrichment, respectively. DEPs were mainly enriched in cellular process, cell, and binding for BP, CC, and MF categories, respectively. DEGs were mainly involved in PI3K-Akt pathway and DEPs were mainly focused in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway. Notably, 14 down-regulated and 22 up-regulated genes/proteins were detected at both the transcript and protein level. LRG1, SERPINE2, STMN1, COL14A1, SLC37A2, and MMP2 were determined as the key genes/proteins in FHN. SERPINE2/STMN1 overexpression increased viability and decreased apoptosis of dexamethasone-treated MC3T3-E1 cells.
Conclusions
Our study investigated some pivotal regulatory genes/proteins in the pathogenesis of FHN, providing novel insight into the genes/proteins involved in FHN.

Abstract: Summary
There is a critical need to develop small-molecule inhibitors of mucin-type O-linked glycosylation. The best-known reagent currently is benzyl-GalNAc, but it is effective only at millimolar concentrations. This article demonstrates that Ac5GalNTGc, a peracetylated C-2 sulfhydryl-substituted GalNAc, fulfills this unmet need. When added to cultured leukocytes, breast cells, and prostate cells, Ac5GalNTGc increased cell-surface VVA binding by ∼10-fold, indicating truncation of O-glycan biosynthesis. Cytometry, mass spectrometry, and western blot analysis of HL-60 promyelocytes demonstrated that 50–80 μM Ac5GalNTGc prevented elaboration of 30%–60% of the O-glycans beyond the Tn-antigen (GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr) stage. The effect of the compound on N-glycans and glycosphingolipids was small. Glycan inhibition induced by Ac5GalNTGc resulted in 50%–80% reduction in leukocyte sialyl-Lewis X expression and L-/P-selectin-mediated rolling under flow conditions. Ac5GalNTGc was pharmacologically active in mouse. It reduced neutrophil infiltration to sites of inflammation by ∼60%. Overall, Ac5GalNTGc may find diverse applications as a potent inhibitor of O-glycosylation.

Abstract: The transcription factor heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) regulates the heat shock response (HSR), a cytoprotective response induced by proteotoxic stresses. Data from model organisms has shown that HSF-1 also has non-stress biological roles, including roles in the regulation of development and longevity. To better study HSF-1 function, we created a C. elegans strain containing HSF-1 tagged with GFP at its endogenous locus utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-guided transgenesis. We show that the HSF-1::GFP CRISPR worm strain behaves similarly to wildtype worms in response to heat and other stresses, and in other physiological processes. HSF-1 was expressed in all tissues assayed. Immediately following the initiation of reproduction, HSF-1 formed nuclear stress bodies, a hallmark of activation, throughout the germline. Upon the transition to adulthood, of HSF-1 nuclear stress bodies appeared in most somatic cells. Genetic loss of the germline suppressed nuclear stress body formation with age, suggesting that the germline influences HSF-1 activity. Interestingly, we found that various neurons did not form nuclear stress bodies after transitioning to adulthood. Therefore, the formation of HSF-1 nuclear stress bodies upon the transition to adulthood does not occur in a synchronous manner in all cell types. In sum, these studies enhance our knowledge of the expression and activity of the aging and proteostasis factor HSF-1 in a tissue-specific manner with age.

The human aortic endothelium undergoes dose-dependent DNA methylation in response to transient hyperglycemia,

Abstract: Background
Glycemic control is a strong predictor of long-term cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes mellitus, and poor glycemic control influences long-term risk of cardiovascular disease even decades after optimal medical management. This phenomenon, termed glycemic memory, has been proposed to occur due to stable programs of cardiac and endothelial cell gene expression. This transcriptional remodeling has been shown to occur in the vascular endothelium through a yet undefined mechanism of cellular reprogramming.
Methods
In the current study, we quantified genome-wide DNA methylation of cultured human endothelial aortic cells (HAECs) via reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) following exposure to diabetic (250 mg/dL), pre-diabetic (125 mg/dL), or euglycemic (100 mg/dL) glucose concentrations for 72 h (n = 2).
Results
We discovered glucose-dependent methylation of genomic regions (DMRs) encompassing 2199 genes, with a disproportionate number found among genes associated with angiogenesis and nitric oxide (NO) signaling-related pathways. Multi-omics analysis revealed differential methylation and gene expression of VEGF (↑5.6% DMR, ↑3.6-fold expression), and NOS3 (↓20.3% DMR, ↓1.6-fold expression), nodal regulators of angiogenesis and NO signaling, respectively.
Conclusion
In the current exploratory study, we examine glucose-dependent and dose-responsive alterations in endothelial DNA methylation to examine a putative epigenetic mechanism underlying diabetic vasculopathy. Specifically, we uncover the disproportionate glucose-dependent methylation and gene expression of VEGF and NO signaling cascades, a physiologic imbalance known to cause endothelial dysfunction in diabetes. We therefore hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms encode a glycemic memory within endothelial cells.

Abstract: Increasing evidence in substantiating the roles of endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses and their interplay is evident in various diseases. However, an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the crosstalk between the intracellular stress signaling pathways and inflammatory responses and their participation in disease progression has not yet been explored. Progress has been made in our understanding of the cross talk and integrated stress signaling network between endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress towards the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. In this present study, we studied the crosstalk between the endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress by understanding the role of protein disulfide isomerase and endoplasmic reticulum oxidase 1α, a key player in redox protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. We had recruited a total of 90 subjects and divided into three groups (control (n = 30), type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 30), and diabetic nephropathy (n = 30)). We found that endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, activating transcription factor 6, inositol-requiring enzyme 1α, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, C/EBP homologous protein, and glucose-regulated protein-78; oxidative stress markers, thioredoxin-interacting protein and cytochrome b-245 light chain; and the crosstalk markers, protein disulfide isomerase and endoplasmic reticulum oxidase-1α, were progressively elevated in type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy subjects. The association between the crosstalk markers showed a positive correlation with endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress markers. Further, the interplay between endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress was investigated in vitro using a human leukemic monocytic cell line under a hyperglycemic environment and examined the expression of protein disulfide isomerase and endoplasmic reticulum oxidase-1α. DCFH-DA assay and flow cytometry were performed to detect the production of free radicals. Further, phosphorylation of eIF2α in high glucose–exposed cells was studied using western blot. In conclusion, our results shed light on the crosstalk between endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress and significantly contribute to the onset and progression of diabetic nephropathy and therefore represent the major therapeutic targets for alleviating micro- and macrovascular complications associated with this metabolic disturbance.

Abstract: Cells dividing in the plane of epithelial tissues proceed by polarized constriction of the actomyosin contractile ring, leading to asymmetric ingression of the plasma mem brane. Asymmetric cytokinesis results in the apical positioning of the actomyosin contractile ring and ultimately of the midbody. Studies have indicated that the contractile ring is associated with adherens junctions, whose role is to maintain epithelial tissue cohesion. However, it is yet unknown when the contractile ring becomes associated with adherens junctions in epithelial cells. Here, we examined contractile ring formation and activation in the epithelium of Xenopus embryos and explored the implication of adherens junctions in the contractile ring formation. We show that accumulation of proteins involved in contractile ring formation and activation is polarized, starting at apical cell-cell contacts at the presumptive division site and spreading within seconds towards the cell basal side. We also show that adherens junctions are involved in the kinetics of contractile ring formation. Our study reveals that the link between the adherens junctions and the contractile ring is established from the onset of cytokinesis.

Abstract: Cellular heterogeneity and diversity are recognized to contribute to the functions of neutrophils under homeostatic and pathological conditions. We previously suggested that the chronic inflammatory responses associated with hypertension (HTN) are related to the participation of different subpopulations of neutrophils. Two populations of neutrophils can be obtained by density gradient centrifugation: normal-density neutrophils (NDN) and low-density neutrophils (LDN). However, the lack of standardized functional protocols has limited phenotypic characterization and functional comparisons of LDN and NDN. Based on their capability to incorporate Na+, maturity and activation stage, we characterized NDN and LDN in blood samples from ten patients with HTN and ten healthy individuals (HI) using flow cytometry. We compared the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and levels of apoptosis in NDN and LDN. In general, the NDN and LDN subpopulations from patients with HTN exhibited higher levels of sodium influx and ROS, and lower levels of apoptosis than the corresponding NDN and LDN subsets from HI. Transmission electron microscopy revealed NDN and LDN from patients with HTN exhibited alterations to mitochondrial morphology and fewer cytoplasmic granules than the corresponding HI subpopulations. Our results indicate both the NDN and LDN subpopulations enhance the effects of inflammation that contribute to the pathophysiology of HTN. Further detailed studies are required to characterize the events during ontogeny of the myeloid lineage that result in the diverse phenotypic characteristics of each subpopulation of LDN and NDN.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the photoreceptor transcription factor gene cone-rod homeobox (CRX) lead to distinct retinopathy phenotypes, including early-onset vision impairment in dominant Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a patient with CRX-I138fs48 mutation, we established an in vitro model of CRX-LCA in retinal organoids that showed defective photoreceptor maturation by histology and gene profiling, with diminished expression of visual opsins. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated CRX gene augmentation therapy partially restored photoreceptor phenotype and expression of phototransduction-related genes as determined by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Retinal organoids derived from iPSCs of a second dominant CRX-LCA patient carrying K88N mutation revealed the loss of opsin expression as a common phenotype, which was alleviated by AAV-mediated augmentation of CRX. Our studies provide a proof-of-concept for developing gene therapy of dominant CRX-LCA and other CRX retinopathies.

Abstract: Endothelial dysfunction is an early step in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Iron overload can lead to excessive mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and vascular endothelial cell (EC) damage. Mitoferrin 2 (Mfrn2) is an iron transporter in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This study aimed to assess whether Mfrn2 and mitochondrial iron overload were involved in atherosclerosis progression and to explore the potential mechanism. We observed significant upregulation of Mfrn2 in the arteries of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed Apolipoprotein E−/- (ApoE−/-) mice and in TNF-α-induced mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs). Mfrn2 gene silencing inhibited mitochondrial iron overload, stabilized mitochondrial membrane potential and improved mitochondrial function in TNF-α-induced MAECs. Vascular EC-specific knockdown of Mfrn2 in ApoE−/- mice markedly decreased atherosclerotic lesion formation and the levels of ICAM-1 in aortas and reduced monocyte infiltration into the vascular wall. Furthermore, TNF-α increased the binding of 14-3-3 epsilon (ε) and Mfrn2, preventing Mfrn2 degradation and leading to mitochondrial iron overload in ECs, while 14-3-3ε overexpression increased Mfrn2 stability by inhibiting its ubiquitination. Together, our results reveal that Mfrn2 deficiency attenuates endothelial dysfunction by decreasing iron levels within the mitochondria and mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings may provide new insights into preventive and therapeutic strategies against vascular endothelial dysfunction in atherosclerotic disease.

Abstract: Summary
Quantifying the replication-competent HIV reservoir is essential for evaluating curative strategies. Viral outgrowth assays (VOAs) underestimate the reservoir because they fail to induce all replication-competent proviruses. Single- or double-region HIV DNA assays overestimate it because they fail to exclude many defective proviruses. We designed two triplex droplet digital PCR assays, each with 2 unique targets and 1 in common, and normalize the results to PCR-based T cell counts. Both HIV assays are specific, sensitive, and reproducible. Together, they estimate the number of proviruses containing all five primer-probe regions. Our 5-target results are on average 12.1-fold higher than and correlate with paired quantitative VOA (Spearman's ρ = 0.48) but estimate a markedly smaller reservoir than previous DNA assays. In patients on antiretroviral therapy, decay rates in blood CD4+ T cells are faster for intact than for defective proviruses, and intact provirus frequencies are similar in mucosal and circulating T cells.

Abstract: Since chronic, non-healing wounds represent an increasing source of economic and temporal burden for patients who suffer from them and healthcare professionals that treat them, therapeutic modalities that promote closure of delayed and non-healing wounds are of utmost importance. Recent clinical results of allografts derived from amnion and chorion placental layers encourage further investigation of the mechanisms underlying clinical efficacy of these products for treatment of wounds. Here, we utilized a diabetic murine splinted excisional wound model to investigate the effects of a dehydrated human amnion/chorion-derived allograft (dHACA) on delayed wound healing, as well as the effects of dehydrated allograft derived solely from amnion tissue of the same donor. We examined wound healing by histological endpoint analysis, and we assessed other parameters relevant to functional wound healing in the wound bed including angiogenesis, macrophage phenotypes, proliferative activity, and gene expression. Herein we demonstrate that application of dHACA to a murine diabetic model of delayed wound progression results in better macroscale wound resolution outcomes, including rate of closure, compared to unaided wound progression, while dehydrated human amnion allograft (dHAA) fails to improve outcomes. Improved gross wound resolution observed with dHACA was accompanied by increased granulation tissue formation, proliferation and vascular ingrowth observed in the wound bed, early macrophage polarization towards anti-inflammatory phenotypes, and downregulation of pro-fibrotic gene expression. Overall, our data suggest that improvements in the rates of delayed wound closure observed from combined amnion/chorion allografts are associated with modulation of critical cellular and tissue processes commonly found to be dysregulated in delayed healing wounds, including proliferation, vascularization, inflammation, and re-epithelialization.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial persistence coupled with biofilm formation is directly associated with failure of antibiotic treatment of tuberculosis. We have now identified 4-(4,7-DiMethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroNaphthalene-1-yl)Pentanoic acid (DMNP), a synthetic diterpene analogue, as a lead compound that was capable of suppressing persistence and eradicating biofilms in Mycobacterium smegmatis. By using two reciprocal experimental approaches – ΔrelMsm and ΔrelZ gene knockout mutations versus relMsm and relZ overexpression technique – we showed that both RelMsm and RelZ (p)ppGpp synthetases are plausible candidates for serving as targets for DMNP. In vitro, DMNP inhibited (p)ppGpp-synthesizing activity of purified RelMsm in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings, supplemented by molecular docking simulation, suggest that DMNP targets the structural sites shared by RelMsm, RelZ, and presumably by a few others as yet unidentified (p)ppGpp producers, thereby inhibiting persister cell formation and eradicating biofilms. Therefore, DMNP may serve as a promising lead for development of antimycobacterial drugs.

Abstract: Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier following spinal cord injury (SCI) seriously affect long-term quality of life. Oxidative stress-induced epithelial cells’ injury contributes to the epithelial barrier dysfunction. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment has been proved to alleviate SCI. However, it is unclear whether or not HBO treatment affects intestinal barrier function following SCI. In this study, our purpose was to explore the impact of HBO treatment on intestinal epithelial barrier function and underlying mechanisms following SCI. An SCI model was established in rats, and the rats received HBO treatment. Intestinal injury, mucosal permeability, intercellular junction proteins, and oxidative stress indicators were evaluated in our study. We found that HBO treatment significantly alleviated intestinal histological damage, reduced mucosal permeability, and markedly prevented bacterial translocation. Furthermore, HBO treatment significantly increased the expression of Claudin-1 and E-cadherin, inhibited intestinal tissue oxidative stress as demonstrated by upregulation of superoxide dismutase and glutathione, and HBO downregulated malondialdehyde. Mechanically, we demonstrated that HBO treatment ameliorated intestinal oxidative stress possibly through upregulating nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream targets, Heme oxygenase-1(HO-1), NADH-quinone oxidoreductase-1(NQO-1), and glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC). These results suggested that HBO treatment triggered antioxidative effects against intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction by promoting Nrf2 signaling pathway after SCI.

Abstract: Summary
Cranial irradiation (IR) is an effective adjuvant therapy in the treatment of childhood brain tumors but results in long-lasting cognitive deficits associated with impaired neurogenesis, as evidenced in rodent models. Metformin has been shown to expand the endogenous neural stem cell (NSC) pool and promote neurogenesis under physiological conditions and in response to neonatal brain injury, suggesting a potential role in neurorepair. Here, we assess whether metformin pretreatment, a clinically feasible treatment for children receiving cranial IR, promotes neurorepair in a mouse cranial IR model. Using immunofluorescence and the in vitro neurosphere assay, we show that NSCs are depleted by cranial IR but spontaneously recover, although deficits to proliferative neuroblasts persist. Metformin pretreatment enhances the recovery of neurogenesis, attenuates the microglial response, and promotes recovery of long-term olfactory memory. These findings indicate that metformin is a promising candidate for further preclinical and clinical investigations of neurorepair in childhood brain injuries.

Abstract: Summary
Naive pluripotency can be maintained in medium with two inhibitors plus leukemia inhibitory factor (2i/LIF) supplementation, which primarily affects canonical WNT, FGF/ERK, and JAK/STAT3 signaling. However, whether one of these three supplements alone is sufficient to maintain naive self-renewal remains unclear. Here we show that LIF alone in medium is sufficient for adaptation of 2i/L-ESCs to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in a hypermethylated state (L-ESCs). Global transcriptomic analysis shows that L-ESCs are close to 2i/L-ESCs and in a stable state between naive and primed pluripotency. Notably, our results demonstrate that DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) play an important role in LIF-dependent mouse ESC adaptation and self-renewal. LIF-dependent ESC adaptation efficiency is significantly increased in serum treatment and reduced in Dnmt3a or Dnmt3l knockout ESCs. Importantly, unlike epiblast stem cells, L-ESCs contribute to somatic tissues and germ cells in chimeras. L-ESCs cultured under such simple conditions as in this study would provide a more conducive platform to clarify the molecular mechanism of ESCs in in vitro culture.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) usually results in respiratory disease, but extrapulmonary manifestations are of major clinical interest. Intestinal symptoms of COVID-19 are present in a significant number of patients, and include nausea, diarrhea, and viral RNA shedding in feces. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal organoids (HIOs) represent an inexhaustible cellular resource that could serve as a valuable tool to study SARS-CoV-2 as well as other enteric viruses that infect the intestinal epithelium. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 productively infects both proximally and distally patterned HIOs, leading to the release of infectious viral particles while stimulating a robust transcriptomic response, including a significant upregulation of interferon-related genes that appeared to be conserved across multiple epithelial cell types. These findings illuminate a potential inflammatory epithelial-specific signature that may contribute to both the multisystemic nature of COVID-19 as well as its highly variable clinical presentation.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic activities are altered in cancer cells compared with those in normal cells, and the cancer-specific pathway becomes a potential therapeutic target. Higher cellular glucose consumption, which leads to lower glucose levels, is a hallmark of cancer cells. In an objective screening for chemicals that induce cell death under low-glucose conditions, we discovered a compound, denoted as ALESIA (Anticancer Ligand Enhancing Starvation-induced Apoptosis). By our shedding assay of transforming growth factor α in HEK293A cells, ALESIA was determined to act as a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 3–G12-biased agonist that promotes nitric oxide production and oxidative stress. The oxidative stress triggered by ALESIA resulted in the exhaustion of glucose, cellular NADPH deficiency, and then cancer cell death. Intraperitoneal administration of ALESIA improved the survival of mice with peritoneally disseminated rhabdomyosarcoma, indicating its potential as a new type of anticancer drug for glucose starvation therapy.

Abstract: Objectives
As an ideal cell source for tissue engineering and bone defect repair, dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have good osteogenic differentiation potential. Chrysin, a flavonoid extracted from oroxylum seeds, has been proven to promote bone formation of bone marrow stem cells. However, the effect of chrysin on osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of Chrysin in promoting osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs and in DPSC-based bone formation.
Material and methods
We investigated the effects of chrysin on DPSCs from patients by CCK-8 assay, Alizarin Red S staining, qPCR and Western blotting. The effects of chrysin on DPSC-based bone formation in a heterotopic osteogenesis model in nude mice and a rat calvarial defect model were also performed. Finally, we investigated the mechanism of chrysin-treated DPSCs by proteomics.
Results
Chrysin upregulated the expression of osteogenic proteins and induced osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs. Moreover, chrysin induced abundant β-TCP-induced formation of mineralized bone tissue and promoted DPSC-based bone formation in a heterotopic osteogenesis model in nude mice and a rat calvarial defect model. Proteomics showed that upregulation of the Smad3 was closely related to osteogenic differentiation. Inhibiting of Smad3 activation by a Smad3 inhibitor could reverse the chrysin-mediated increases in the expression levels of osteogenic genes and osteogenic induction of DPSCs.
Conclusions
Our study implies the intriguing potential of chrysin-treated DPSCs in bone regeneration and bone defect repair.

Abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected over 200 countries and territories worldwide and resulted in more than 2.5 million deaths. In a pressing search for treatments and vaccines, research models based on human stem cells are emerging as crucial tools to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and cellular responses across different tissues. Here, we provide an overview of the variety of human pluripotent stem cell-based platforms adopted in SARS-CoV-2 research, comprising monolayer cultures and organoids, which model the multitude of affected tissues in vitro. We highlight the strengths of these platforms, including their application to assess both the susceptible cell types and the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. We describe their use to identify drug candidates for further investigation in addition to discussing their limitations in fully recapitulating COVID-19 pathophysiology. Overall, stem cell models are facilitating the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and prove to be versatile platforms for studying infections.

Abstract: Background
Endothelial cell dysfunction plays the crucial role in initiation and propagation of obstructive arteriosclerosis which ultimately causes arterial obstructive syndrome. Additionally, severe endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) dysfunction is always found in those of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. This study tested the hypothesis that a novel method, named “quality and quantity (QQ) culture”, could successfully improve the EPC proliferation and function in ESRD patients.
Materials and methods
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were isolated from age-matched control subjects (i.e., normal renal function) (group 1) and ESRD patients (group 2), followed by culture in either conventional EPC culture for one month or in QQ culture for 7 days, respectively. The result showed that as compared to the conventional EPC culture method, the EPC population and M2-like population/ratio (M2/M1) were significantly enriched in QQ culture both in groups 1 and 2 (all p < 0.001), but these parameters did not differ between the groups. As compared with conventional EPC culture, the angiogenesis capacity and colony formation were significantly increased in QQ culture (all p < 0.001), but they showed no difference between groups 1 and 2. In RAW264.7 macrophages treated by liposaccharide, the gene expressions and ELISA findings of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β/IL-6/TGF-β) and inflammatory mediator (iNOS) were significantly reduced in QQ culture than in conventional EPC culture in groups 1 and 2 (all p < 0.001), but they showed no difference between the groups.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated that QQ culture enhanced number, proliferation, and angiogenesis of EPCs and anti-inflammatory capacity in ESRD patients.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are of great clinical interest as a form of allogenic therapy due to their excellent regenerative and immunomodulatory effects for various therapeutic indications. Stirred suspension bioreactors using microcarriers (MC) have been used for large-scale production of MSCs compared to planar cultivation systems. Previously, we have demonstrated that expansion of MSCs in MC-spinner cultures improved chondrogenic, osteogenic, and cell migration potentials as compared to monolayer-static cultures. In this study, we sought to address this by analyzing global gene expression patterns, miRNA profiles and secretome under both monolayer-static and MC-spinner cultures in serum-free medium at different growth phases. The datasets revealed differential expression patterns that correlated with potentially improved MSC properties in cells from MC-spinner cultures compared to those of monolayer-static cultures. Transcriptome analysis identified a unique expression signature for cells from MC-spinner cultures, which correlated well with miRNA expression, and cytokine secretion involved in key MSC functions. Importantly, MC-spinner cultures and conditioned medium showed increased expression of factors that possibly enhance pathways of extracellular matrix dynamics, cellular metabolism, differentiation potential, immunoregulatory function, and wound healing. This systematic analysis provides insights for the efficient optimization of stem cell bioprocessing and infers that MC-based bioprocess manufacturing could improve post-expansion cellular properties for stem cell therapies.

Abstract: N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) modification is the most abundant chemical modification in mRNA, and it participates in various biological processes, such as cell differentiation and proliferation. However, little is known about the function of m6A demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) in myoblast proliferation. Here, we demonstrated that knockdown of FTO can significantly inhibit myoblast proliferation and promote apoptosis. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that a lot of downregulated genes in FTO knockdown cells are associated with cell cycle and apoptosis. Furthermore, silencing FTO drastically decreased cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression through YTHDF2-mediated mRNA degradation, thereby delaying the progression of G1 phase, and leading to impaired myoblast proliferation. These findings unraveled that FTO regulates myoblast proliferation by controlling CCND1 expression in an m6A-YTHDF2-dependent manner, which highlights the critical roles of m6A modification in myoblast proliferation.

Abstract: The lampbrush chromosomes (LBCs) in oocytes of the Mexican axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) were identified some time ago by their relative lengths and predicted centromeres, but they have never been associated completely with the mitotic karyotype, linkage maps or genome assembly. We identified 9 of the axolotl LBCs using RNAseq to identify actively transcribed genes and 13 BAC (bacterial artificial clone) probes containing pieces of active genes. Using read coverage analysis to find candidate centromere sequences, we developed a centromere probe that localizes to all 14 centromeres. Measurements of relative LBC arm lengths and polymerase III localization patterns enabled us to identify all LBCs. This study presents a relatively simple and reliable way to identify each axolotl LBC cytologically and to anchor chromosome-length sequences (from the axolotl genome assembly) to the physical LBCs by immunostaining and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Our data will facilitate a more detailed transcription analysis of individual LBC loops.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular reprogramming is driven by a defined set of transcription factors; however, the regulatory logic that underlies cell-type specification and diversification remains elusive. Single-cell RNA-seq provides unprecedented coverage to measure dynamic molecular changes at the single-cell resolution. Here, we multiplex and ectopically express 20 pro-neuronal transcription factors in human dermal fibroblasts and demonstrate a widespread diversification of neurons based on cell morphology and canonical neuronal marker expressions. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals diverse and distinct neuronal subtypes, including reprogramming processes that strongly correlate with the developing brain. Gene mapping of 20 exogenous pro-neuronal transcription factors further unveiled key determinants responsible for neuronal lineage specification and a regulatory logic dictating neuronal diversification, including glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons. The multiplex scRNA-seq approach is a robust and scalable approach to elucidate lineage and cellular specification across various biological systems.

Abstract: Endometriosis is a benign gynecological disease that is manifested by the presence and growth of endometrial cells and glands outside the uterine. Active angiogenesis, migration, and invasion of endometrial tissue outside the uterine are critical for the development of endometriosis and lead to the survival and growth of endometriotic lesions. Metformin, as an anti-diabetic agent, represents anti-angiogenic property. Here, we performed a study using human normal endometrial stromal cells (N-ESCs) from healthy endometrial tissue and human eutopic endometrial stromal cells (EU-ESCs) and ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ECT-ESCs) from endometriosis patients. ESCs were cultured and treated with different concentrations of Metformin (0–20 mmol/l) for 72 h to evaluate Metformin effect on cell viability, proliferation, migration was measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and scratch test respectively as well as expression of angiogenesis and migration markers. The Metformin reduced cell migration, and proliferation of endometriotic stromal cells in a time and concentration dependently manner. Furthermore, Metformin attenuated the expression of angiogenic and inflammatory genes in human endometriotic stromal cells. The direct anti-proliferative effect on ECT-ESCs combined with the effects of Metformin on inflammatory and angiogenesis-related genes expression supports its therapeutic potential for endometriosis. Metformin could be used as an effective adjuvant in endometriosis treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Across species, expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor ATOH1 promotes differentiation of cochlear supporting cells to sensory hair cells required for hearing. In mammals, this process is limited to development, whereas nonmammalian vertebrates can also regenerate hair cells after injury. The mechanistic basis for this difference is not fully understood. Hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) is a transcriptional repressor known to inhibit Atoh1 in the cerebellum. We therefore investigated its potential role in cochlear hair cell differentiation. We find that Hic1 is expressed throughout the postnatal murine cochlear sensory epithelium. In cochlear organoids, Hic1 knockdown induces Atoh1 expression and promotes hair cell differentiation, while Hic1 overexpression hinders differentiation. Wild-type HIC1, but not the DNA-binding mutant C521S, suppresses activity of the Atoh1 autoregulatory enhancer and blocks its responsiveness to β-catenin activation. Our findings reveal the importance of HIC1 repression of Atoh1 in the cochlea, which may be targeted to promote hair cell regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
One cause of human male infertility is a scarcity of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) in testes with Sertoli cells that neither produce adequate amounts of GDNF nor form the Sertoli-Sertoli junctions that form the blood-testis barrier (BTB). These patients raise the issue of whether a pool of SSCs, depleted due to inadequate GDNF stimulation, will expand if normal signaling is restored. Here, we reduce adult mouse SSC numbers by 90% using a chemical-genetic approach that reversibly inhibits GDNF signaling. Signal resumption causes all remaining SSCs to replicate immediately, but they primarily form differentiating progenitor spermatogonia. Subsequently, self-renewing replication restores SSC numbers. Testicular GDNF levels are not increased during restoration. However, SSC replication decreases as numbers of SSCs and progenitors increase, suggesting important regulatory interactions among these cells. Finally, sequential loss of SSCs and then pachytene spermatocytes causes dissolution of the BTB, thereby recapitulating another important characteristic of some infertile men.

Abstract: Summary
SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viral burden in the respiratory tract, enabling transmission and leading to substantial lung pathology. The 1212C2 fully human monoclonal antibody was derived from an IgM memory B cell of a COVID-19 patient, has high affinity for the Spike protein receptor binding domain, neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, and exhibits in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic activity in hamsters when delivered intraperitoneally, reducing upper and lower respiratory viral burden and lung pathology. Inhalation of nebulized 1212C2 at levels as low as 0.6 mg/kg, corresponding to 0.03 mg/kg lung-deposited dose, reduced the viral burden below the detection limit and mitigated lung pathology. The therapeutic efficacy of an exceedingly low dose of inhaled 1212C2 supports the rationale for local lung delivery for dose-sparing benefits, as compared to the conventional parenteral route of administration. These results suggest that the clinical development of 1212C2 formulated and delivered via inhalation for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be considered.

Abstract: IRS4 is a member of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) protein family. It acts as a cytoplasmic adaptor protein, integrating and transmitting signals from receptor protein tyrosine kinases to the intracellular environment. IRS4 can induce mammary tumorigenesis and is usually overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, little is known about the role of IRS4 in the development and progression of lung cancer. In this study, we show that IRS4 knockout suppresses the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of A549 lung cancer cells, as well as tumor growth in a nude mouse xenograft model. In contrast, stable expression of IRS4 showed the opposite effects. As expected, IRS4 was found to activate the PI3K/Akt and Ras-MAPK pathways, and we also showed that IRS4 depletion significantly enhanced the sensitivity of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-resistant cells to gefitinib. Taken together, these results show that IRS4 promotes NSCLC progression and may represent a potential therapeutic target for EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC.

Abstract: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to play a crucial role in the onset and progression of cervical cancer (CC). Here, the results of RNA microarray and RNA-sequencing dataset analysis showed that lncRNA DLEU2 was significantly upregulated in CC tissues. Clinicopathologic analysis indicated that lncRNA DLEU2 was closely related to tumor topography. Functional experiments and bioinformatics analysis revealed that lncRNA DLEU2 promoted CC cell proliferation and accelerated the cell cycle. Mechanistically, lncRNA DLEU2 promoted the progression of the cell cycle and inhibited the activity of the Notch signaling pathway by inhibiting p53 expression. Additionally, lncRNA DLEU2 probably interacted with ZFP36 Ring Finger Protein (ZFP36) to inhibit the expression of p53. In conclusion, this study revealed the function of lncRNA DLEU2 in CC tumorigenesis, suggesting new therapeutic targets in CC.

Abstract: Heat stress (HS) results in health problems in animals. This study was conducted to investigate the effect and the underlying mechanism of HS on the proliferation and differentiation process of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated at 37°C or 41.5 °C. HS up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression level of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). Furthermore, the proliferation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were significantly inhibited after HS treatment for 2 days. A large number of accumulated lipid droplets were observed under the microscope after HS treatment for 8 days. Notably, the result of oil red O staining showed that the number of lipid droplets increased significantly and the differentiation ability of the cells was enhanced after HS. Moreover, after 2 and 8 d of differentiation, HS increased the transcription levels of fat synthesis genes including peroxisome proliferators activated receptor γ (PPARγ), fatty acid binding protein 2 (AP2), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein α (CEBPα) genes, while decreasing the transcription levels of lipid decomposition genes including ATGL and HSL genes. In addition, HS reduced the expression of AMPK and PGC-1α, as well as the dephosphorylation of AMPK. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) can eliminate HS induced lipogenesis by activating AMPK. These results indicated that HS inhibited the proliferation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and promoted lipid accumulation by inhibiting the AMPK-PGC-1α signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. This work lays a theoretical foundation for improving the effect of HS on meat quality of livestock and provides a new direction for the prevention of obesity caused by HS.

Abstract: TNF-α-inducible protein 8-like 2 (TIPE2) is a recently discovered regulator of inflammation that can maintain immune homeostasis, exerting a significant role in the development of inflammation-related diseases. Here, we aimed to explore the role and potential regulatory mechanism of TIPE2 in the progression of inflammatory pain. In the present study, a mouse BV2 microglia cell activation-mediated inflammatory model was developed with LPS induction, and a mouse inflammatory pain model was established with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) injection. In vitro, the TIPE2 expression was decreased in LPS-induced BV2 cells. Overexpression of TIPE2 mitigated LPS-medicated microglial activation via decreasing nitric oxide (NO) generation and the expression of microglia marker IBA-1. Notably, increasing TIPE2 expression alleviated microglial activation-triggered expression levels and releases of proinflammatory factors such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Mechanism analysis verified that overexpression of TIPE2 blunted Rac1-mediated activation of NF-κB pathway following LPS stimulation. More importantly, CFA injection reduced the expression of TIPE2 in a mouse inflammatory pain model and overexpression of TIPE2 alleviated CFA-mediated pain hypersensitivity and inflammatory response, and inactivated microglia cell in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of TIPE2 decreased Rac1 expression and suppressed the activation of NF-κB pathway in spinal cord after CFA injection. In summary, the present study revealed that overexpression of TIPE2 mitigated inflammatory pain through suppressing microglial activation-induced inflammation by inactivating Rac1/NF-κB pathway. The study provides a novel theoretical foundation for the therapy of inflammatory pain.

Abstract: Summary
Interactions between B cells and CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are key determinants of humoral responses. Using samples from clinical trials performed with the malaria vaccine candidate antigen Plasmodium falciparum merozoite protein (PfRH5), we compare the frequency, phenotype, and gene expression profiles of PfRH5-specific circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells elicited by two leading human vaccine delivery platforms: heterologous viral vector prime boost and protein with AS01B adjuvant. We demonstrate that the protein/AS01B platform induces a higher-magnitude antigen-specific cTfh cell response and that this correlates with peak anti-PfRH5 IgG concentrations, frequency of PfRH5-specific memory B cells, and antibody functionality. Furthermore, our data indicate a greater Th2/Tfh2 skew within the polyfunctional response elicited following vaccination with protein/AS01B as compared to a Th1/Tfh1 skew with viral vectors. These data highlight the impact of vaccine platform on the cTfh cell response driving humoral immunity, associating a high-magnitude, Th2-biased cTfh response with potent antibody production.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanisms underlying severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease remain poorly understood. We analyze several thousand plasma proteins longitudinally in 306 COVID-19 patients and 78 symptomatic controls, uncovering immune and non-immune proteins linked to COVID-19. Deconvolution of our plasma proteome data using published scRNA-seq datasets reveals contributions from circulating immune and tissue cells. Sixteen percent of patients display reduced inflammation yet comparably poor outcomes. Comparison of patients who died to severely ill survivors identifies dynamic immune-cell-derived and tissue-associated proteins associated with survival, including exocrine pancreatic proteases. Using derived tissue-specific and cell-type-specific intracellular death signatures, cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, and our data, we infer whether organ damage resulted from direct or indirect effects of infection. We propose a model in which interactions among myeloid, epithelial, and T cells drive tissue damage. These datasets provide important insights and a rich resource for analysis of mechanisms of severe COVID-19 disease.

Abstract: Aims
Far-infrared (FIR) irradiation inhibits adipogenic differentiation of tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) by activating Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), but it stimulates osteogenic differentiation in a PP2B-independent pathway. We investigated the potential involvement of transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels, a well-known Ca2+-permeable channel, in the effects of FIR irradiation on adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation of TMSCs.
Methods
TMSCs, in the absence or presence of activators or inhibitors, were exposed to FIR irradiation followed by adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation, which was assessed using Oil red O or Alizarin red S staining, respectively. RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting were used to determine gene and protein expression of calcium channels and adipocyte-specific markers.
Results
Treatment with the calcium ionophore ionomycin simulated the inhibitory effect of FIR irradiation on adipogenic differentiation but had no effect on osteogenic differentiation, indicating the involvement of intracellular Ca2+ in adipogenic differentiation. Inhibition of pan-TRP channels using ruthenium red reversed the FIR irradiation-induced inhibition of adipogenic differentiation. Among the TRP channels tested, inhibition of the TRPV2 channel by tranilast or siRNA against TRPV2 attenuated the inhibitory effect of FIR irradiation on adipogenic differentiation, accompanied by a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ levels. By contrast, activation of the TRPV2 channel by probenecid simulated FIR irradiation-induced inhibition of adipogenic differentiation. Expectedly, the stimulatory effect of FIR irradiation on osteogenic differentiation was independent of the TRPV2 channel.
Conclusion
Our data demonstrate that the TRPV2 channel is a sensor/receptor for the inhibited adipogenic differentiation of TMSCs associated with FIR irradiation.

Abstract: PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) is the ligand of PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) and regulates inhibitory immune responses. It is well known that PD-L1 suppresses T cell function via binding to PD-1. However, little is known about the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in macrophage polarization. According to previous studies, the function of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in macrophage polarization is controversial, and the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Thus, we treated THP-1-derived macrophages with human PD-L1 Fc to determine the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in macrophage polarization. To further explore the mechanism, we performed RNA sequencing and used specific inhibitors to identify the implicated signalling pathways. In this study, we found that PD-L1 induces the upregulation of CD206 expression, which is inhibited by nivolumab, LY294002, U0126, and rapamycin. Evaluation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and bioinformatics analysis indicated that PD-L1 also induces the upregulation of the expression of genes that maintain mitochondrial function and mediate metabolic switching. In addition, we did not detect PD-L1-induced CD86 alterations, indicating that PD-L1 treatment has no significant influence on M1 polarization. Taken together, these results suggest that PD-L1 binds to PD-1 and promotes M2 polarization accompanied by mitochondrial function enhancement and metabolic reprogramming via Erk/Akt/mTOR. This study elucidates the role of PD-L1 in macrophage polarization and verifies the underlying mechanisms for the first time. Considering that aberrantly upregulated PD-L1 expression contributes to a wide variety of diseases, targeting PD-L1-mediated macrophage polarization is a prospective therapeutic strategy for both neoplastic and nonneoplastic diseases.

Abstract: The high aggressiveness of gliomas remains a huge challenge to clinical therapies, and the hypoxic microenvironment in the core region is a critical contributor to glioma aggressiveness. In this study, it was found that miR-485–5p was low expressed within glioma tissue samples and cells. GO enrichment annotation indicated that the predicted downstream targets miR-485–5p were enriched in hypoxia response and decreased oxygen level. In glioma cells, miR-485–5p overexpression suppressed cell viability, migratory ability, and invasive ability under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Through direct binding, miR-485–5p suppressed SRPK1 expression. Under hypoxia, SRPK1 overexpression enhanced hypoxia-induced glioma cell aggressiveness and significantly reversed the effects of miR-485–5p overexpression. Moreover, HIF1A could target the miR-485–5p promoter region to inhibit the transcription. HIF1A, miR-485–5p, and SRPK1 form a regulatory axis, which modulates glioma cell aggressiveness under hypoxia. In conclusion, we identify a HIF1A/miR-485–5p/SRPK1 axis that modulates the aggressiveness of glioma cells under hypoxia. The axis could potentially provide new research avenues in the treatment of gliomas considering the hypoxic environment in its core.

Green hydrogen: The only oxygen and water balanced fuel,

Abstract: The use of any fuel depletes the oxygen content of the atmosphere, with one exception: hydrogen produced from water. Water electrolysis liberates oxygen from water in the precise stoichiometric ratio required to oxidise (and hence release energy from) the co-produced hydrogen. As a commercial fuel production process, electrolysis is unique in providing the oxidant as well as the fuel; electrolytic oxygen can thereby replenish the consumption of atmospheric oxygen due to hydrogen use. Furthermore, the amount of water consumed during electrolysis is reproduced when the hydrogen is oxidised. So the use of electrolysers and electrolytic hydrogen does not affect global oxygen and water resources: ‘green’ hydrogen may thus be described as the only oxygen and water balanced fuel. Conversely, the use of hydrogen derived from fossil fuels (with or without carbon capture and storage, CCS) depletes the oxygen resource and increases water vapour emissions to the atmosphere, which enhances the rate of global warming. Therefore, a worldwide multi-TW deployment of electrolysers could provide very substantial amounts of hydrogen for the energy system, and oxygen for the global ecosystem. This should be done in combination with other measures for combatting oxygen depletion (such as reducing combustion, increasing forestation, and reducing nutrient inputs to the ocean from sewage and agriculture). In this way the long-term objective should be to stabilise, or even increase slightly, the concentrations of atmospheric and aquatic oxygen, and possibly speed up the decay of atmospheric methane. Clearly the production-and-use of hydrogen derived from fossil fuels contravenes this objective, and should cease without delay.

Abstract: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common type of hair loss dysfunction. Secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1) is found to be associated with hair loss, but its role in AGA and the regulation mechanism of its transcription level is unclear. The aim of our study is to explore the expression of SFRP1 in AGA samples and its transcriptional mechanism. Male frontal and occipital scalp hair follicles from AGA patients were collected, and human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) were isolated and cultured. SFRP1 gene was cloned and constructed into recombinant plasmids to perform dual-luciferase reporter assay. Transcription factor binding sites were predicted through the Jaspar website and further confirmed by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Expression of genes in DPCs was determined by immunofluorescence (IF) staining, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Our findings showed that SFRP1 was highly expressed in DPCs of AGA patients. The core promoter region of SFRP1 was from −100 to +50 bp and was found to be positively regulated by forkhead box C1 (FOXC1), a transcription factor related to hair growth, both at mRNA and protein level in DPCs. Our study suggests that FOXC1 plays an important role in regulating SFRP1 transcription, which may provide new insights into the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AGA.

Abstract: Summary
A big challenge in natural product research of today is rapid dereplication of already known substances, to free capacities for the exploration of new agents. Prompt information on bioactivities and mode of action (MOA) speeds up the lead discovery process and is required for rational compound optimization. Here, we present a bioreporter approach as a versatile strategy for combined bioactivity- and MOA-informed primary screening for antimicrobials. The approach is suitable for directly probing producer strains grown on agar, without need for initial compound enrichment or purification, and works along the entire purification pipeline with culture supernatants, extracts, fractions, and pure substances. The technology allows for MOA-informed purification to selectively prioritize activities of interest. In combination with high-resolution mass spectrometry, the biosensor panel is an efficient and sensitive tool for compound deconvolution.

Abstract: Summary
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and variants has led to significant mortality. We recently reported that an RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 system, called prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells (PAC-MAN), offered an antiviral strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus. Here, we expand in silico analysis to use PAC-MAN to target a broad spectrum of human- or livestock-infectious RNA viruses with high specificity, coverage, and predicted efficiency. Our analysis reveals that a minimal set of 14 CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) is able to target >90% of human-infectious viruses across 10 RNA virus families. We predict that a set of 5 experimentally validated crRNAs can target new SARS-CoV-2 variant sequences with zero mismatches. We also build an online resource (crispr-pacman.stanford.edu) to support community use of CRISPR-Cas13 for broad-spectrum RNA virus targeting. Our work provides a new bioinformatic resource for using CRISPR-Cas13 to target diverse RNA viruses to facilitate the development of CRISPR-based antivirals.

Abstract: Summary
With age, neural stem cell (NSC) function in the adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) declines, reducing memory and cognitive function in males; however, the impact on females is not well understood. To obtain a global view of how age and sex impact the mouse V-SVZ, we constructed 3D montages after multiplex immunostaining, and used computer-based 3D image analysis to quantify data across the entire niche at 2, 18, and 22 months. We discovered dramatic sex differences in the aging of the V-SVZ niche vasculature, which regulates NSC activity: females showed increased diameter but decreased vessel density with age, while males showed decreased diameter and increased tortuosity and vessel density. Accompanying these vascular changes, males showed significant decline in NSC numbers, progenitor cell proliferation, and more disorganized migrating neuroblast chains with age; however, females did not. By examining the entire 3D niche, we found significant sex differences, with females being relatively spared through very old age.

Abstract: Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have been observed to occur in two distinct states — naive and primed. Both naive and primed state PSCs can give rise to tissues of all the three germ layers in vitro but differ in their potential to generate germline chimera in vivo. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern these two states of pluripotency in human can open a plethora of opportunities for studying early embryonic development and in biomedical applications. In this work, we use weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the key molecular makers and their interactions that define the two distinct pluripotency states. Signed hybrid network was reconstructed from transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) of naive and primed state pluripotent samples. Our analysis revealed two sets of genes that are involved in the establishment and maintenance of naive and primed states. The naive state genes were found to be enriched for biological processes and pathways related to metabolic processes while primed state genes were associated with system development. We further filtered these lists to identify the intra-modular hubs and the hub transcription factors (TFs) for each group. Validation of the identified TFs was carried out using independent microarray datasets and we finally present a list of 52 and 33 TFs as the set of core TFs that are responsible for the induction and maintenance of naive and primed states of pluripotency in human, respectively. Among these, the TFs ZNF275, ZNF232, SP4, and MSANTD3 could be of interest as they were not reported in previous studies.

Abstract: Summary
ESC- and iPSC-derived retinal transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach for disease with end-stage retinal degeneration, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. We previously showed medium- to long-term survival, maturation, and light response of transplanted human ESC- and iPSC-retina in mouse, rat, and monkey models of end-stage retinal degeneration. Because the use of patient hiPSC-derived retina with a disease-causing gene mutation is not appropriate for therapeutic use, allogeneic transplantation using retinal tissue/cells differentiated from a stocked hESC and iPSC line would be most practical. Here, we characterize the immunological properties of hESC- and iPSC-retina and present their three major advantages: (1) hESC- and iPSC-retina expressed low levels of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and little HLA class II in vitro, (2) hESC- and iPSC-retina greatly suppressed immune activation of lymphocytes in co-culture, and (3) hESC- and iPSC-retina suppressed activated immune cells partially via transforming growth factor β signaling. These results support the use of allogeneic hESC- and iPSC-retina in future clinical application.

Abstract: Summary
In both plant and animal innate immune responses, surveillance of pathogen infection is mediated by membrane-associated receptors and intracellular nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat receptors (NLRs). Homeostasis of NLRs is under tight multilayered regulation to avoid over-accumulation or over-activation, which often leads to autoimmune responses that have detrimental effects on growth and development. How NLRs are regulated epigenetically at the chromatin level remains unclear. Here, we report that SWP73A, an ortholog of the mammalian switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling protein BAF60, suppresses the expression of NLRs either directly by binding to the NLR promoters or indirectly by affecting the alternative splicing of some NLRs through the suppression of cell division cycle 5 (CDC5), a key regulator of RNA splicing. Upon infection, bacteria-induced small RNAs silence SWP73A to activate a group of NLRs and trigger robust immune responses. SWP73A may function as a H3K9me2 reader to enhance transcription suppression.

Abstract: Summary
Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) is a rare neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease caused by an inherited deficiency of β-galactocerebrosidase (GALC). GLD pathogenesis and therapeutic correction have been poorly studied in patient neural cells. Here, we investigated the impact of GALC deficiency and lentiviral vector-mediated GALC rescue/overexpression in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural progenitors and neuronal/glial progeny obtained from two GLD patients. GLD neural progeny displayed progressive psychosine storage, oligodendroglial and neuronal defects, unbalanced lipid composition, and early activation of cellular senescence, depending on the disease-causing mutation. The partial rescue of the neural differentiation program upon GALC reconstitution and psychosine clearance suggests multiple mechanisms contributing to neural pathology in GLD. Also, the pathological phenotype associated to supraphysiological GALC levels highlights the need of regulated GALC expression for proper human neural commitment/differentiation. These data have important implications for establishing safe therapeutic strategies to enhance disease correction of GLD.

FKBP22 from the psychrophilic bacterium Shewanella sp. SIB1 selectively binds to the reduced state of insulin to prevent its aggregation,

Abstract: FKBP22 of a psychrophilic bacterium, Shewanella sp. SIB1 (SIB1 FKBP22), is a member of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) and consists of N- and C-domains responsible for chaperone-like and PPIase catalytic activities, respectively. The chaperone-like activity of SIB1 FKBP22 was previously evidenced by its ability to prevent dithiothreitol (DTT)-induced insulin aggregation. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which this protein inhibits the aggregation remains unclear. To address this, the binding affinity of SIB1 FKBP22 to the native or reduced states of insulin was examined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The native and reduced states refer to insulin in the absence or DTT presence, respectively. The SPR sensorgram showed that SIB1 FKBP22 binds specifically to the reduced state of insulin, with a KD value of 37.31±3.20 μM. This binding was facilitated by the N-domain, as indicated by the comparable KD values of the N-domain and SIB1 FKBP22. Meanwhile, the reduced state of insulin was found to have no affinity towards the C-domain. The KD value of SIB1 FKBP22 was slightly decreased by NaCl but was not severely affected by FK506, a specific FKBP inhibitor. Similarly, the prevention of DTT-induced aggregation by SIB1 FKBP22 was also modulated by the N-domain and was not affected by FK506. Further, the reduced and native states of insulin had no effect on the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of SIB1 FKBP22 towards a peptide substrate. Nevertheless, the reduced state of insulin slightly reduced the catalytic efficiency towards refolding RNase T1, at up to 1.5-fold lower than in the absence of insulin. These results suggested that the binding event was mainly facilitated by hydrophobic interaction and was independent from its PPIase activity. Altogether, a possible mechanism by which SIB1 FKBP22 prevents DTT-induced insulin aggregation was proposed.

Abstract: Immune escape is the main cause of the low response rate to immunotherapy for cancer, including ovarian cancer. Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) inhibits immune cell function. However, only few reports described the mechanism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of immune escape regulated by GDF-15 in ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer patients and healthy women were enrolled in this study. Immunohistochemistry and ELISA were performed to measure GDF-15 expression. Immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance, and co-immunoprecipitation assay were used to evaluate the interaction between GDF-15 and the surface molecules of DCs. Immunofluorescence analysis, flow cytometry and transwell assay were used to evaluate additional effects of GDF-15 on DCs. The results showed that GDF-15 expression was higher in the ovarian cancer patients compared to that in the healthy women. The TIMER algorithm revealed that highly GDF-15 expression is associated with immune DC infiltration in immunoreactive high-grade serous carcinoma. A further study showed that GDF-15 suppressed DCs maturation, as well as IL-12p40 and TNF-α secretion, the length and number of protrusions and the migration. More importantly, CD44 in the surface of DCs interacted with GDF-15. The overexpression of CD44 in DCs resulted in the suppression of the inhibitory effect of GDF-15 on the length and number of DC synapses. In DCs overexpressing CD44 the inhibition of GDF-15 on the expression of CD11c, CD83 and CD86 was decreased, while in DCs with a knockdown of CD44 the inhibition was further enhanced. Knockdown of CD44 in DCs enhanced the inhibitory effect of GDF-15 on DC migration, while the overexpression of CD44 inhibited the inhibitory effect of GDF-15 on DC migration. In conclusion, the present study suggested that GDF-15 might facilitate ovarian cancer immune escape by interacting with CD44 in DCs to inhibit their function.

Abstract: Increased matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression is involved in delayed wound healing in diabetic foot ulcers. We created skin wounds in normal SD rats and STZ-induced diabetic SD rats, then we found protein levels of activator protein-1 (AP1), a crucial transcription factor to increase MMP9 transcription, as well as MMP9 was up-regulated in epithelium of diabetic skin tissues. Then, we evaluated the mRNA and protein stability of AP1 subunits C-FOS/C-Jun in HaCaT cells after high glucose treatment. Results showed that high glucose could increase protein stability of C-FOS and C-Jun. Additionally, high glucose also activated extracellular signaling-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). ERK1/2 inhibitor could rescue phosphorylation of C-FOS and C-Jun, increased protein stability of C-Jun, and increased MMP9 expressions. Thus, our study demonstrated that high glucose could activate ERK1/2 to stabilize AP1 and increase MMP9 expression in diabetic skin and HaCaT cells.

Abstract: Summary
Isobiotic mice, with an identical stable microbiota composition, potentially allow models of host-microbial mutualism to be studied over time and between different laboratories. To understand microbiota evolution in these models, we carried out a 6-year experiment in mice colonized with 12 representative taxa. Increased non-synonymous to synonymous mutation rates indicate positive selection in multiple taxa, particularly for genes annotated for nutrient acquisition or replication. Microbial sub-strains that evolved within a single taxon can stably coexist, consistent with niche partitioning of ecotypes in the complex intestinal environment. Dietary shifts trigger rapid transcriptional adaptation to macronutrient and micronutrient changes in individual taxa and alterations in taxa biomass. The proportions of different sub-strains are also rapidly altered after dietary shift. This indicates that microbial taxa within a mouse colony adapt to changes in the intestinal environment by long-term genomic positive selection and short-term effects of transcriptional reprogramming and adjustments in sub-strain proportions.

Abstract: Although delivery of neural stem cell (NSC) as a therapeutic treatment for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) provides promise, NSC delivery typically has extremely low survival rates. Here, we investigate endothelial cell (EC) and pericyte (PC) interactions with NSC, where our results demonstrate that EC, and not PC, promote NSC cell proliferation and reduce cytotoxicity under glucose deprivation (GD). Additionally, NSC proliferation was increased upon treatment with EC conditioned media, inhibited with antagonism of VEGFR3. In an NSC + EC co-culture we detected elevated levels of VEGF-C, not seen for NSC cultured alone. Exogenous VEGF-C induced NSC upregulation of VEGFR3, promoted proliferation, and reduced cytotoxicity. Finally, we delivered microbeads containing NSC + EC into a murine ICH cavity, where VEGF-C was increasingly present in the injury site, not seen upon delivery NSC encapsulated alone. These studies demonstrate that EC-secreted VEGF-C may promote NSC survival during injury, enhancing the potential for cell delivery therapies for stroke.

Abstract: Summary
Apelin receptor (APLNR/AGTRLl1/APJ) marks a transient cell population during the differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from pluripotent stem cells, but its function during the production and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells is not clear. We generated an Aplnr-tdTomato reporter mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line and showed that HSPCs are generated exclusively from mesodermal cells that express Aplnr-tdTomato. HSPC production from mESCs was impaired when Aplnr was deleted, implying that this pathway is required for their production. To address the role of APLNR signaling in HSPC maintenance, we added APELIN ligands to ex vivo AGM cultures. Activation of the APLNR pathway in this system impaired the generation of long-term reconstituting HSPCs and appeared to drive myeloid differentiation. Our data suggest that the APLNR signaling is required for the generation of cells that give rise to HSCs, but that its subsequent downregulation is required for their maintenance.

Abstract: Here, we assessed the effects of varying concentrations of gelatin coating on Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor κ-B Ligand (RANKL)-induced RAW264.7 murine macrophage differentiation into osteoclast (OC) via osteoclastogenesis. The microstructures of coating surfaces with different concentrations of gelatin were examined by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Increased gelatin coating concentrations led to decreased gel rigidity but increased surface adhesion force attenuated OC differentiation and the decreased actin ring formation in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. The decreased actin ring formation is associated with decreased lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) activity and bone resorption in the differentiated OCs with different gelatin coating concentrations as compared to the cells differentiated without gelatin coatings. In addition, increasing concentrations of gelatin coating attenuated the medium TGF-β1 protein levels and the expression levels of TGF-β and type-I (R1) and type-II (R2) TGF-β receptors in OCs, suggesting the gelatin-induced suppression of TGF-β signaling for the regulation of RNAKL-induced OC differentiation. Taken together, these findings showed that changes in gelatin coating concentrations, which were associated with altered gel thickness and substrate rigidity, might attenuate TGF-β signaling events to modulate OC differentiation and concomitant actin ring formation and bone matrix resorption in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Chondrodysplasias are hereditary diseases caused by mutations in the components of growth cartilage. Although the unfolded protein response (UPR) has been identified as a key disease mechanism in mouse models, no suitable in vitro system has been reported to analyze the pathology in humans. Here, we developed a three-dimensional culture protocol to differentiate hypertrophic chondrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and examine the phenotype caused by MATN3 and COL10A1 mutations. Intracellular MATN3 or COL10 retention resulted in increased ER stress markers and ER size in most mutants, but activation of the UPR was dependent on the mutation. Transcriptome analysis confirmed a UPR with wide-ranging changes in bone homeostasis, extracellular matrix composition, and lipid metabolism in the MATN3 T120M mutant, which further showed altered cellular morphology in iPSC-derived growth-plate-like structures in vivo. We then applied our in vitro model to drug testing, whereby trimethylamine N-oxide led to a reduction of ER stress and intracellular MATN3.

Abstract: Summary
Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare disease in which patients experience severe light sensitivity. It is caused by a deficiency of ferrochelatase (FECH), the last enzyme in heme biosynthesis (HBS). The lack of FECH causes accumulation of its photoreactive substrate protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) in patients' erythrocytes. Here, we explored an approach for the treatment of EPP by decreasing PPIX synthesis using small-molecule inhibitors directed to factors in the HBS pathway. We generated a FECH-knockout clone from K562 erythroleukemia cells, which accumulates PPIX and undergoes oxidative stress upon light exposure. We used these matched cell lines to screen a set of publicly available inhibitors of factors in the HBS pathway. Inhibitors of the glycine transporters GlyT1 and GlyT2 lowered levels of PPIX and markers of oxidative stress selectively in K56211B4 cells, and in primary erythroid cultures from an EPP patient. Our findings open the door to investigation of glycine transport inhibitors for HBS disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate cytolytic effectors that target HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. In conjunction with antibodies recognizing the HIV envelope, NK cells also eliminate HIV-infected targets through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). However, how these NK cell functions impact infected macrophages is less understood. We show that HIV-infected macrophages resist NK cell-mediated killing. Compared with HIV-infected CD4+ T cells, initial innate NK cell interactions with HIV-infected macrophages skew the response toward cytokine production, rather than release of cytolytic contents, causing inefficient elimination of infected macrophages. Studies with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells demonstrate that the viral envelope is equally accessible on CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Nonetheless, ADCC against macrophages is muted compared with ADCC against CD4+ T cells. Thus, HIV-infected macrophages employ mechanisms to evade immediate cytolytic NK cell function while preserving inflammatory cytokine responses. These findings emphasize the importance of eliminating infected macrophages for HIV cure efforts.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious microvascular complication of diabetes. Gambogic acid has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effect. However, the effect of GA on inflammatory response of ARPE-19 cells remains unclear. In our study, ARPE-19 cells were stimulated by palmitic acid (PA) induction in the presence of 30mM glucose and then treated with 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20μm GA. CCK-8 assay showed that cell viability was increased by GA treatment at doses of 0.5, 1, and 2μm instead of higher doses. ELISA analysis found that GA dose-dependently reduced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-α and IL-1β. Western blot indicated that GA downregulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components including TXNIP, NLRP3, ASC, cleaved-caspase-1, and cleaved-IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis suggested that GA effectively increased the protein level of nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). RT-qPCR showed that GA significantly increased the mRNA levels of Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1). Furthermore, Nrf2 siRNA transfection confirmed the above effects of GA. In total, subtoxic doses of GA significantly flattened the inflammatory response induced by HG and PA in ARPE-19 cells via modulating the Nrf2 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Oxygen therapy is a common treatment in neonatal intensive care units, but long-term continuous hyperoxia ventilation may induce acute lung injury (ALI). Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis participates in various diseases including ALI, but the role of GSDMD in hyperoxia-induced ALI is yet understood. Here, we showed a significant increase in GSDMD after exposure to high oxygen. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in GSDMD regulation, we identified the core promoter of GSDMD, −98 ~ −12 bp relative to the transcriptional start site (TSS). The results of mutational analysis, overexpression or siRNA interference, EMSA and ChIP demonstrated that E2F4 and TFAP2A positively regulate the transcriptional activity of the GSDMD by binding to its promoter. However, only TFAP2A showed a regulatory effect on the expression of GSDMD. Moreover, TFAP2A was increased in the lung tissues of rats exposed to hyperoxia and showed a strong linear correlation with GSDMD. Our results indicated that TFAP2A positively regulates the GSDMD expression via binding to the promoter region of GSDMD.

Abstract: The laryngotracheal cartilage is a cardinal framework for the maintenance of the airway for breathing, which occasionally requires reconstruction. Because hyaline cartilage has a poor intrinsic regenerative ability, various regenerative approaches have been attempted to regenerate laryngotracheal cartilage. The use of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cartilage regeneration has been widely investigated. However, long-term culture may limit proliferative capacity. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MSCs (iMSCs) can circumvent this problem due to their unlimited proliferative capacity. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of iMSCs in the regeneration of thyroid cartilage in immunodeficient rats. Herein, we induced iMSCs through neural crest cell intermediates. For the relevance to prospective future clinical application, induction was conducted under xeno-free/serum-free conditions. Then, clumps fabricated from an iMSC/extracellular matrix complex (C-iMSC) were transplanted into thyroid cartilage defects in immunodeficient rats. Histological examinations revealed cartilage-like regenerated tissue and human nuclear antigen (HNA)-positive surviving transplanted cells in the regenerated lesion. HNA-positive cells co-expressed SOX9, and type II collagen was identified around HNA-positive cells. These results indicated that the transplanted C-iMSCs promoted thyroid cartilage regeneration and some of the iMSCs differentiated into chondrogenic lineage cells. Induced MSCs may be a promising candidate cell therapy for human laryngotracheal reconstruction.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulated pre-mRNA splicing is an emerging Achilles heel of cancers and myelodysplasias. To expand the currently limited portfolio of small-molecule drug leads, we screened for chemical modulators of the U2AF complex, which nucleates spliceosome assembly and is mutated in myelodysplasias. A hit compound specifically enhances RNA binding by a U2AF2 subunit. Remarkably, the compound inhibits splicing of representative substrates and stalls spliceosome assembly at the stage of U2AF function. Computational docking, together with structure-guided mutagenesis, indicates that the compound bridges the tandem U2AF2 RNA recognition motifs via hydrophobic and electrostatic moieties. Cells expressing a cancer-associated U2AF1 mutant are preferentially killed by treatment with the compound. Altogether, our results highlight the potential of trapping early spliceosome assembly as an effective pharmacological means to manipulate pre-mRNA splicing. By extension, we suggest that stabilizing assembly intermediates may offer a useful approach for small-molecule inhibition of macromolecular machines.

Abstract: Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and induced PSCs (iPSCs) are excellent tools for studying embryonic development in organisms and classified into naïve and primed states. ESC-derived germline chimera individuals can be produced by injecting naïve ESCs/iPSCs into preimplantation embryos, and conversion of primed human ESCs/iPSCs into a naïve state provides insights into epiblast cell features. Non-human ESCs/iPSCs are alternatives to human naïve ESCs/iPSCs, which elicit ethical issues. In this study, we used the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) as an animal model. Since 1996, 16 marmoset ESC lines have been established. Because most of these ESC lines are female and were derived >10 years ago, new ESCs, particularly male marmoset ESC lines, are needed. Here, we successfully established 17 novel marmoset ESC lines, including six male ESC lines from in vitro-fertilized (IVF) embryos and 12 ESC lines under feeder-free conditions. This report is the first to establish ESC lines using feeder-free conditions and IVF preimplantation blastocysts in marmosets, and these novel ESC lines could potentially facilitate future non-human primate ESC studies.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia, the immune cells of the central nervous system, play critical roles in brain physiology and pathology. We report a novel approach that produces, within 10 days, the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into microglia (iMG) by forced expression of both SPI1 and CEBPA. High-level expression of the main microglial markers and the purity of the iMG cells were confirmed by RT-qPCR, immunostaining, and flow cytometry analyses. Whole-transcriptome analysis demonstrated that these iMGs resemble human fetal/adult microglia but not human monocytes. Moreover, these iMGs exhibited appropriate physiological functions, including various inflammatory responses, ADP/ATP-evoked migration, and phagocytic ability. When co-cultured with hiPSC-derived neurons, the iMGs respond and migrate toward injured neurons. This study has established a protocol for the rapid conversion of hiPSCs into functional iMGs, which should facilitate functional studies of human microglia using different disease models and also help with drug discovery.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to genetically manipulate organisms has led to significant insights into functional genomics in many species. In birds, manipulation of the genome is hindered by the inaccessibility of the one-cell embryo. During embryonic development, avian primordial germ cells (PGCs) migrate through the bloodstream and reach the gonadal anlage, where they develop into mature germ cells. Here, we explored the use of PGCs to produce transgenic offspring in the zebra finch, which is a major animal model for sexual brain differentiation, vocal learning, and vocal communication. Zebra finch PGCs (zfPGCs) obtained from embryonic blood significantly proliferated when cultured in an optimized culture medium and conserved the expression of germ and stem cell markers. Transduction of cultured zfPGCs with lentiviral vectors was highly efficient, leading to strong expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein. Transduced zfPGCs were injected into the host embryo and transgenic songbirds were successfully generated.

Abstract: The mechanism that mediates the interaction between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane during cytokinesis remains elusive. We previously found that ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins, which usually mediate cellular pole contraction, become over-accumulated at the cell equator and support furrow ingression upon the loss of other actin-membrane associated proteins, anillin and supervillin. In this study, we addressed the molecular basis of the exchangeability between ezrin and other actin-membrane associated proteins in mediating cortical contraction during cytokinesis. We found that depletion of anillin and supervillin caused over-accumulation of the membrane-associated FERM domain and actin-binding C-terminal domain (C-term) of ezrin at the cleavage furrow, respectively. This finding suggests that ezrin differentially shares its binding sites with these proteins on the actin cytoskeleton or inner membrane surface. Using chimeric mutants, we found that ezrin C-term, but not the FERM domain, can substitute for the corresponding anillin domains in cytokinesis and cell proliferation. On the other hand, either the membrane-associated or the actin/myosin-binding domains of anillin could not substitute for the corresponding ezrin domains in controlling cortical blebbing at the cell poles. Our results highlight specific designs of actin- or membrane-associated moieties of different actin-membrane associated proteins with limited exchangeability, which enables them to support diverse cortical activities on the shared actin-membrane interface during cytokinesis.

Abstract: Summary
The gut microbiota produces metabolites that regulate host immunity, thereby impacting disease resistance and susceptibility. The extent to which commensal bacteria reciprocally respond to immune activation, however, remains largely unexplored. Herein, we colonized mice with four anaerobic symbionts and show that acute immune responses result in dramatic transcriptional reprogramming of these commensals with minimal changes in their relative abundance. Transcriptomic changes include induction of stress-response mediators and downregulation of carbohydrate-degrading factors such as polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs). Flagellin and anti-CD3 antibody, two distinct immune stimuli, induced similar transcriptional profiles, suggesting that commensal bacteria detect common effectors or activate shared pathways when facing different host responses. Immune activation altered the intestinal metabolome within 6 hours, decreasing luminal short-chain fatty acid and increasing aromatic metabolite concentrations. Thus, intestinal bacteria, prior to detectable shifts in community composition, respond to acute host immune activation by rapidly changing gene transcription and immunomodulatory metabolite production.

Abstract: Summary
Spatial organization of molecules and cells in complex tissue microenvironments provides essential organizational cues in health and disease. A significant need exists for improved visualization of these spatial relationships. Here, we describe a multiplex immunofluorescence imaging method, termed SeqStain, that uses fluorescent-DNA-labeled antibodies for immunofluorescent staining and nuclease treatment for de-staining that allows selective enzymatic removal of the fluorescent signal. SeqStain can be used with primary antibodies, secondary antibodies, and antibody fragments to efficiently analyze complex cells and tissues. Additionally, incorporation of specific endonuclease restriction sites in antibody labels allows for selective removal of fluorescent signals while retaining other signals that can serve as marks for subsequent analyses. The application of SeqStain on human kidney tissue provided a spatialomic profile of the organization of >25 markers in the kidney, highlighting it as a versatile, easy-to-use, and gentle new technique for spatialomic analyses of complex microenvironments.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the power of photopharmacology for interrogating signaling proteins, many photopharmacological systems are limited by their efficiency, speed, or spectral properties. Here, we screen a library of azobenzene photoswitches and identify a urea-substituted “azobenzene-400” core that offers bistable switching between cis and trans with improved kinetics, light sensitivity, and a red-shift. We then focus on the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), neuromodulatory receptors that are major pharmacological targets. Synthesis of “BGAG12,400,” a photoswitchable orthogonal, remotely tethered ligand (PORTL), enables highly efficient, rapid optical agonism following conjugation to SNAP-tagged mGluR2 and permits robust optical control of mGluR1 and mGluR5 signaling. We then produce fluorophore-conjugated branched PORTLs to enable dual imaging and manipulation of mGluRs and highlight their power in ex vivo slice and in vivo behavioral experiments in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Finally, we demonstrate the generalizability of our strategy by developing an improved soluble, photoswitchable pore blocker for potassium channels.

Abstract: Plasmodium falciparum is a unicellular protozoan parasite and causative agent of a severe form of malaria in humans, accounting for very high worldwide fatality rates. At the molecular level, survival of the parasite within the human host is mediated by P. falciparum heat shock proteins (PfHsps) that provide protection during febrile episodes. The ATP-dependent chaperone activity of Hsp70 relies on the co-chaperone J domain protein (JDP), with which it forms a chaperone-co-chaperone complex. The exported P. falciparum JDP (PfJDP), PFA0660w, has been shown to stimulate the ATPase activity of the exported chaperone, PfHsp70-x. Furthermore, PFA0660w has been shown to associate with another exported PfJDP, PFE0055c, and PfHsp70-x in J-dots, highly mobile structures found in the infected erythrocyte cytosol. Therefore, the present study aims to conduct a structural and functional characterization of the full-length exported PfJDP, PFE0055c. Recombinant PFE0055c was successfully expressed and purified and found to stimulate the basal ATPase activity of PfHsp70-x to a greater extent than PFA0660w but, like PFA0660w, did not significantly stimulate the basal ATPase activity of human Hsp70. Small-molecule inhibition assays were conducted to determine the effect of known inhibitors of JDPs (chalcone, C86) and Hsp70 (benzothiazole rhodacyanines, JG231 and JG98) on the basal and PFE0055c-stimulated ATPase activity of PfHsp70-x. In this study, JG231 and JG98 were found to inhibit both the basal and PFE0055c-stimulated ATPase activity of PfHsp70-x. C86 only inhibited the PFE0055c-stimulated ATPase activity of PfHsp70-x, consistent with PFE0055c binding to PfHsp70-x through its J domain. This research has provided further insight into the molecular basis of the interaction between these exported plasmodial chaperones, which could inform future antimalarial drug discovery studies.

Abstract: Summary
Aberrant NOTCH3 signaling and overexpression is oncogenic, associated with cancer stem cells and drug resistance, yet therapeutic targeting remains elusive. Here, we develop NOTCH3-targeted antibody drug conjugates (NOTCH3-ADCs) by bioconjugation of an auristatin microtubule inhibitor through a protease cleavable linker to two antibodies with differential abilities to inhibit signaling. The signaling inhibitory antibody rapidly induces ligand-independent receptor clustering and internalization through both caveolin and clathrin-mediated pathways. The non-inhibitory antibody also efficiently endocytoses via clathrin without inducing receptor clustering but with slower lysosomal co-localization kinetics. In addition, DLL4 ligand binding to the NOTCH3 receptor mediates transendocytosis of NOTCH3-ADCs into ligand-expressing cells. NOTCH3-ADCs internalize into receptor and ligand cells independent of signaling and induce cell death in both cell types representing an atypical mechanism of ADC cytotoxicity. Treatment of xenografts with NOTCH3-ADCs leads to sustained tumor regressions, outperforms standard-of-care chemotherapy, and allows targeting of tumors that overexpress NOTCH3 independent of signaling inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
Immune systems restrict microbial pathogens by identifying “non-self” molecules called microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). It is unclear how immune responses are tuned to or by MAMP diversity present in commensal microbiota. We systematically studied the variability of commensal peptide derivatives of flagellin (flg22), a MAMP detected by plants. We define substantial functional diversity. Most flg22 peptides evade recognition, while others contribute to evasion by manipulating immunity through antagonism and signal modulation. We establish a paradigm of signal integration, wherein the sequential signaling outputs of the flagellin receptor are separable and allow for reprogramming by commensal-derived flg22 epitope variants. Plant-associated communities are enriched for immune evading flg22 epitopes, but upon physiological stress that represses the immune system, immune-activating flg22 epitopes become enriched. The existence of immune-manipulating epitopes suggests that they evolved to either communicate or utilize the immune system for host colonization and thus can influence commensal microbiota community composition.

PDGF-BB-mediated activation of CREB in vascular smooth muscle cells alters cell cycling via Rb, FoxO1 and p27kip1,

Abstract: Introduction & Aim
The vascular response to injury leads to the secretion of several factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB). PDGF-BB stimulates smooth muscle cell (SMC) conversion to the synthetic phenotype, thereby enhancing proliferation and migration, and contributing to neointimal hyperplasia. Likewise, the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor has been shown to mediate SMC proliferation in response to various mitogens. We therefore investigated the contribution of CREB to PDGF-BB-dependent proliferation of SMCs with the intention of identifying signaling pathways involved both up and downstream of CREB activation.
Methods & Results
Treatments were performed on vascular SMCs from a porcine coronary artery explant model. The role of CREB was examined via adenoviral expression of a dominant-negative CREB mutant (kCREB) as well as inhibition of CREB binding protein (CBP). Involvement of the p27kip1 pathway was determined using a constitutively expressing p27kip1 adenoviral vector. PDGF-BB stimulated transient CREB phosphorylation on Ser-133 via ERK1/2-, PI3-kinase- and Src-dependent pathways. Expression of kCREB decreased PDGF-BB-dependent cell proliferation. PCNA expression and Rb phosphorylation were also inhibited by kCREB. These cell cycle proteins are controlled via p27kip1 expression in response to CREB-dependent post-translational modification of FoxO1. kCREB had no effect on Cyclin D1 expression, but did prevent PDGF-BB-induced Cyclin D1 nuclear translocation. An interaction inhibitor of CBP confirmed that Cyclin D1 is downstream of PDGF-BB and CREB.
Conclusion
CREB phosphorylation is required for SMC proliferation in response to PDGF-BB. This phenotypic change requires CBP and is mediated by Cyclin D1 and p27kip as a result of changes in FoxO1 activity.

Abstract: Summary
The past decade has witnessed an extremely rapid increase in the number of newly established stem cell lines. However, due to the lack of a standardized format, data exchange among stem cell line resources has been challenging, and no system can search all stem cell lines across resources worldwide. To solve this problem, we have developed the Integrated Collection of Stem Cell Bank data (ICSCB) (http://icscb.stemcellinformatics.org/), the largest database search portal for stem cell line information, based on the standardized data items and terms of the MIACARM framework. Currently, ICSCB can retrieve >16,000 cell lines from four major data resources in Europe, Japan, and the United States. ICSCB is automatically updated to provide the latest cell line information, and its integrative search helps users collect cell line information for over 1,000 diseases, including many rare diseases worldwide, which has been a formidable task, thereby distinguishing itself from other database search portals.

Abstract: Summary
Controlling cell fate has great potential for regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and basic research. Although transcription factors are able to promote cell reprogramming and transdifferentiation, methods based on their upregulation often show low efficiency. Small molecules that can facilitate conversion between cell types can ameliorate this problem working through safe, rapid, and reversible mechanisms. Here, we present DECCODE, an unbiased computational method for identification of such molecules based on transcriptional data. DECCODE matches a large collection of drug-induced profiles for drug treatments against a large dataset of primary cell transcriptional profiles to identify drugs that either alone or in combination enhance cell reprogramming and cell conversion. Extensive validation in the context of human induced pluripotent stem cells shows that DECCODE is able to prioritize drugs and drug combinations enhancing cell reprogramming. We also provide predictions for cell conversion with single drugs and drug combinations for 145 different cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Humoral immune responses are dysregulated with aging, but the cellular and molecular pathways involved remain incompletely understood. In particular, little is known about the effects of aging on T follicular helper (Tfh) CD4 cells, the key cells that provide help to B cells for effective humoral immunity. We performed transcriptional profiling and cellular analysis on circulating Tfh before and after influenza vaccination in young and elderly adults. First, whole-blood transcriptional profiling shows that ICOS+CD38+ cTfh following vaccination preferentially enriches in gene sets associated with youth versus aging compared to other circulating T cell types. Second, vaccine-induced ICOS+CD38+ cTfh from the elderly had increased the expression of genes associated with inflammation, including tumor necrosis factor-nuclear factor κB (TNF-NF-κB) pathway activation. Finally, vaccine-induced ICOS+CD38+ cTfh display strong enrichment for signatures of underlying age-associated biological changes. These data highlight the ability to use vaccine-induced cTfh as cellular “biosensors” of underlying inflammatory and/or overall immune health.

The JmjC-domain protein NO66/RIOX-1 affects the balance between proliferation and maturation in acute myeloid leukemia,

Abstract: As epigenetic regulators are frequently dysregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) we determined expression levels of the JmjC-protein NO66 in AML cell lines and sub fractions of healthy human hematopoietic cells. NO66 is absent in the AML cell lines KG1/KG1a which consist of cells with the immature CD34+/CD38- phenotype and is regarded as a “stem cell-like” model system. Similarly, NO66 is not detectable in CD34+/CD38- cells purified from healthy donors but is clearly expressed in the more committed CD34+/CD38+ cell population. Loss of NO66 expression in KG1/KG1a cells is due to hyper-methylation of its promoter and is released by DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors. In KG1a cells stably expressing exogenous wild type (KG1a66wt) or enzymatically inactive mutant (KG1a66mut) NO66, respectively, the wild type protein inhibited proliferation and rDNA transcription. Gene expression profiling revealed that the expression of NO66 induces a transcriptional program enriched for genes with roles in proliferation and maturation (e.g.EPDR1, FCER1A, CD247, MYCN, SNORD13). Genes important for the maintenance of stem cell properties are downregulated (e.g. SIRPA, Lin28B, JAML). Our results indicate that NO66 induces lineage commitment towards myeloid progenitor cell fate and suggest that NO66 contributes to loss of stem cell properties.
