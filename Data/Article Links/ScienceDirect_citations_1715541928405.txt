Abstract: We examined the biological functions of the gene Cbl in erythropoietin (EPO) signaling using Cbl-deficient F-36P human erythroleukemia cells by the introduction of the Cbl siRNA expression vector. Knockdown of Cbl promoted EPO-dependent proliferation and survival of F-36P cells, especially at a low concentration of EPO (0.01U/mL), similar to serum concentrations of EPO in healthy volunteers (0.005–0.04U/mL). We found that Src was degraded mainly by the proteasomal pathway because the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 but not the lysosome inhibitor NH4Cl suppressed the EPO-induced degradation of Src in F-36P cells and that knockdown of Cbl inhibited EPO-induced ubiquitination and degradation of Src in F-36P cells. The experiments using the Src inhibitor PP1 and co-expression experiments further confirmed that Cbl and the kinase activity of Src are required for the EPO-induced ubiquitination of Src. In addition, the co-expression experiments and in vitro kinase assay demonstrated that the EPO-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Cbl were dependent on the kinase activity of Src but not Jak2. Thus, Cbl negatively regulates EPO signaling mainly through the proteasome-dependent degradation of Src, and the E3 ligase activity of Cbl and its tyrosine phosphorylation are regulated by Src but not Jak2.

Abstract: Semiconductor oxide nanocomposites have attracted widespread attention because of their potential to combine desirable properties of different nanoscale building blocks to achieve advantageous optical properties. Among these semiconductor oxides, SnO2 and ZnO semiconductor materials as well-known direct wide band gaps have numerous applications in micro/nanodevices, gas sensors and catalyst supports due to their excellent optoelectronic and highly sensitive gas sensing properties. Herein, ZnO/SnO2 nanocomposites have been successfully prepared from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and SnCl4·5H2O by sol–gel method and supercritical fluid drying processes. Micro/nanostructural analysis revealed the presence of heterojunction frameworks in the ZnO/SnO2 nanocomposites. These heterojunction frameworks were adorned with ZnO and SnO2 quantum dots. The size distribution of ZnO and SnO2 quantum dots ranged from 3–7nm. These quantum dots were dispersed uniformly on the ZnO/SnO2 heterojunction frameworks. Experimental results indicated that calcination temperatures could affect the optical properties of ZnO/SnO2 nanocomposites. The photoluminescence intensity increased when the calcination temperature increased from 500–700°C. This is attributed to the decrease in the number of surface dangling bonds of ZnO and SnO2 quantum states.

Abstract: Texture surfaces of ZnO:Al (AZO) films are prepared by ammonium acetate, a neutral etching agent. The structural, optical, and electrical properties of AZO films are investigated in detail for improving the light trapping ability. Under the optimal etching conditions (e.g., solution concentration of 5.0wt% and etching time of 20min), AZO films have a typical crater-like structure with haze values in the 20–30% range, as well as a high visible transparence and electrical conductivity. A feasible mechanism model is proposed to explain the etching process. Both H+ and OH− hydrolyzed in solution are involved in the etching reaction. The etching reaction and product diffusion co-dominate the process to form crater-like structures. In ammonium acetate, the etching process is much mild and controllable, making it easy to generate homogeneous texture morphologies in a large area. The high conversion efficiency of 10.75% is achieved for single-junction amorphous silicon thin-film solar cells using textured AZO films as the front contact layers. The ammonium acetate is an ideal etchant for preparing textured AZO films for commercial applications in solar cells.

Abstract: Transcription factor stem cell leukemia (SCL), also known as the T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL1), plays a key role in the regulation of hematopoiesis, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the effects of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal pathways underlying the biologic activity of SCL/TAL1 on normal hematopoietic development. Lentiviral vectors with up or down-regulation of SCL/TAL1 were transfected into umbilical cord blood CD34 stem cells. EGFR signaling pathways (including MEK/ERK and Akt/mTOR) and surface hematopoietic markers were analyzed in the process of hematopoietic differentiation. The data revealed that up or down-regulation of SCL/TAL1 gene was accompanied positively by the expressions of p-MEK and p-ERK1/2 protein, but the changes of Akt/mTOR were unobvious. MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 and SCL/TAL1 down-regulation showed similar inhibitory effects on erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryoid differentiation. However, Akt/mTOR pathway altered insignificantly. MEK/ERK inhibitor U0126 could not affect the expression of SCL/TAL1 mRNA or protein. Taken together, these findings fully illustrated that SCL/TAL1 is located in the up-stream of MEK/ERK pathway and partially regulates hematopoiesis by modulating the phosphorylation level of the key proteins in MEK/ERK pathway.

Abstract: The possibility to tune optical constants of porphyrins, only by varying the core substituents of the molecules, endorse them as promising thin film materials for dye-sensitized- or hybrid molecular heterojunction- solar cells. For the design and improvement of such optical devices involving porphyrin layers, exact knowledge of the optical properties is desirable. Here, thermally grown thin films of different meso-tetraphenyl porphyrins (i.e. H2TPP, NiTPP, and CoTPP) on silicon are assessed by spectroscopic ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. Optical constants were determined in the near-IR to near-UV spectral range. A detailed discussion of the optical bands and the related electronic transitions is performed.

Abstract: Glypican 3 (GPC3) has been paid particular attention owing to its potential as diagnosis marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Identifying the mechanisms regulating the reactivation of GPC3 in HCC appears to be clinically meaningful. Previous study identified zinc-fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) as transcriptional factor responsible for postnatal repression of GPC3 in mice. Here, in this study, we provided the first evidence that down regulated ZHX2 is responsible for GPC3 reactivation in HCC. First, inverse correlation of ZHX2 with GPC3 expression was shown in cultured liver cell lines. Second, ZHX2 overexpression significantly decreased GPC3 expression, while ZHX2 knockdown effectively increased GPC3 level in different HCC cell lines. Consistently, dual luciferase and ChIP assay showed that ZHX2 dose-dependently suppressed GPC3 promoter activity by binding with the core promoter. More importantly, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the inverse correlation between nuclear ZHX2 with GPC3 expression in HCC tissues. Further in vitro analysis showed that nuclear translocation was crucial for ZHX2 mediated repression on GPC3 transcription. Taken together, our results prove that ZHX2 suppresses GPC3 transcription by binding with its core promoter and reduced nucleic ZHX2 expression may be involved in GPC3 reactivation in HCC.

Abstract: While absent from normal epithelia, an actin bundling protein, fascin, becomes expressed in invasive carcinoma of different origins. It is highly enriched at the tumors’ invasive front suggesting that it could play a role in cancer invasion. Multiple studies have shown that fascin, through its role in formation of cellular protrusions such as filopodia and invadopodia, enhances cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro. However, the role of fascin in vivo remains unknown. We have generated a compound transgenic mouse model that allows expression of fascin in the intestinal epithelium in the Apc-mutated background. Conditional expression of fascin led to decrease in mice survival and increase in tumor burden compared to control animals. Induction of fascin expression in adult tumor-bearing animals accelerated tumor progression and led to formation of invasive adenocarcinoma. Altogether, our study shows that fascin can promote tumor progression in vivo, but also unravels an unexpected role of fascin in tumor initiation.

Abstract: Background and objectives
There is limited information regarding the outcome of patients treated for leukemia during pregnancy. This study was performed on all cases of leukemia during pregnancy identified in our institution leukemia database.
Patients and methods
It is a retrospective study from our existing database. Thirty two cases were identified among the cohort of patients treated for acute and chronic leukemia between January 1991 and July 2003.
Results
Among the acute leukemia patients (n=21), 10 patients (47.6%) received chemotherapy during pregnancy, seven had live birth and three had spontaneous abortion. No teratogenicity or congenital malformations or postnatal complication were reported. The remaining 11 (52.4%) were not given chemotherapy while pregnant; three patients presented after 34weeks of gestation ending in normal live births and then received chemotherapy and eight patients had abortion before starting chemotherapy. Among the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients (n=11), nine patients received hydroxyurea, one patient received alfa-interferon and one patient was treated with leukapheresis. Eight patients had normal live births and three patients had abortion. Out of the 32 patients, 18 patients (56.2%) subsequently underwent HLA matched sibling allogeneic stem cell transplantation, seven for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and nine for CML. After a median follow up of 16years, five patients (15.6%) are alive in remission (one from chemotherapy group and four from SCT group).
Conclusions
Our report lends credence to the safety and feasibility of administering anti-leukemic therapy in acute and chronic leukemias during pregnancy although acute leukemia patients had possibly a poor long term outcome compared to non-pregnant patients.

Abstract: Nanoparticles may address challenges by human diseases through improving diagnosis, vaccination and treatment. The uptake mechanism regulates the type of threat a particle poses on the host cells and how a cell responds to it. Hence, understanding the uptake mechanisms and cellular interactions of nanoparticles at the cellular and subcellular level is a prerequisite for their effective biomedical applications. The present study shows the uptake mechanisms of polystyrene nanoparticles and factors affecting their uptake in bone marrow-derived macrophages, 293T kidney epithelial cells and L929 fibroblasts. Labeling with the endocytic marker FM4-64 and transmission electron microscopy studies show that the nanoparticles were internalized rapidly via endocytosis and accumulated in intracellular vesicles. Soon after their internalizations, nanoparticles trafficked to organelles with acidic pH. Analysis of the ultrastructural morphology of the plasma membrane invaginations or extravasations provides clear evidence for the involvement of several uptake routes in parallel to internalize a given type of nanoparticles by mammalian cells, highlighting the complexity of the nanoparticle–cell interactions. Blocking the specific endocytic pathways by different pharmacological inhibitors shows similar outcomes. The potential to take up nanoparticles varies highly among different cell types in a particle sizes-, time- and energy-dependent manner. Furthermore, infection and the activation status of bone marrow-derived macrophages significantly affect the uptake potential of the cells, indicating the need to understand the diseases’ pathogenesis to establish effective and rational drug-delivery systems. This study enhances our understanding of the application of nanotechnology in biomedical sciences.

Abstract: The normal development of placenta relies essentially on a balanced proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of cytotrophoblasts. These processes are tightly regulated by several hormones, cytokines, lipids and other molecules and anomalies in these events are associated with gestational complications. The cation channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is expressed in several organs and tissues and it participates in cellular events like nociception, inflammation and cell death. However, the expression and importance of this receptor in human placenta still remains unknown. In this work, we found that TRPV1 is expressed in human cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Furthermore, the TRPV1 agonists capsaicin and anandamide decreased cytotrophoblast viability and induced morphological alterations, such as chromatin condensation and fragmentation, which suggest the occurrence of apoptosis. Also, both TRPV1 agonists induced a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase of caspase 3/7 activity and production of reactive species of oxygen and nitrogen. Furthermore, capsaicin (10μM) impaired the spontaneous in vitro differentiation of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts by triggering TRPV1, as observed by the decrease in placental alkaline phosphatase activity and in human chorionic gonadotropin secretion. On the other hand, anandamide decreased placental alkaline phosphatase activity via a TRPV1-independent mechanism but did not influence the secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin. In conclusion, we showed that TRPV1 is expressed in human cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts and also reported the involvement of this receptor in cytotrophoblast apoptosis and differentiation.

Abstract: Treatment optimization in acute myeloid leukemia requires the accurate assignment of patients at diagnosis to specific risk groups to guide subsequent risk-adapted treatment stratification. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of expression of the gene BAALC in conjunction with MDR1 in AML with intermediate cytogenetic risk group to more precisely define risk assessment. Low MDR1/high BAALC, high MDR1/low BAALC, and high MDR1/high BAALC expressers demonstrated a similar clinical outcome with CR rate being 68.75–75% and relapse rate being 40–50% and therefore could be considered as a “combined group”. In contrast, low expression of both BAALC and MDR1 identifies an intermediate cytogenetic risk group a distinctly favorable outcome, with higher CR rate being 93.3%, lower relapse rate being 7.1%, and longer OS being 50.3% than that of the “combined group”. Moreover, low MDR1/low BAALC expressers in the intermediate cytogenetic risk group also demonstrated a comparable clinical outcome with patients in the favorable-risk group. Thus low MDR1/low BAALC expression identifies a subgroup of intermediate cytogenetic risk AML patients with a remarkably good long-term outcome achieved by chemotherapy alone.

Abstract: Factor VII, the initiator of the extrinsic coagulation cascade, circulates in human plasma mainly in its zymogen form, factor VII and in small amounts in its activated form, factor VIIa. However, the mechanism of initial generation of factor VIIa is not known despite intensive research using currently available model systems. Earlier findings suggested serine proteases factor VII activating protease and hepsin play a role in activating factor VII, however, it has remained controversial. In this paper we estimated the levels of factor VIIa and factor VII for the first time in zebrafish adult population and also reevaluated the role of the above two serine proteases in activating factor VII in vivo using zebrafish as a model system. Knockdown of factor VII activating protease and hepsin was performed followed by assaying for their effect on factor VIIa concentration and extrinsic coagulation as measured by the kinetic prothrombin time. Factor VII activating protease knockdown showed no change in kinetic prothrombin time and no effect on factor VIIa levels while hepsin knockdown increased the kinetic prothrombin time and significantly reduced the factor VIIa plasma levels. Our results thus indicate that hepsin plays a physiologically important role in factor VII activation and hemostasis in zebrafish.

Abstract: Background
Non-invasive methods like MRI-based techniques have been considered recently for assessment of liver and heart status in patients with thalassemia major (TM). The purpose of this study is to examine the alterations of hepatic and myocardial T2∗ MRI values in TM patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) just before starting chelation therapy.
Procedure
The study included fifty-two TM patients with mean age of 7.6years who were referred to our center for HSCT. Before HSCT, patients underwent liver biopsy to determine fibrosis stage based on the Lucarelli classification. Hepatic and myocardial T2∗ values before and 6months after transplantation were measured and analyzed.
Results
There was not a statistically significant increase in myocardial T2∗ values after HSCT (p-value=0.35). Hepatic T2∗ values significantly decreased after HSCT (p-value <0.001), showing the liver status has been worsened. In subgroup analysis, post-HSCT hepatic T2∗ values (adjusted for baseline values) were significantly higher in patients with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) compared to non-GvHD patients (p-value=0.04).
Conclusions
The issue of iron overload is still remained as the main problem in ex-thalassemic patients after HSCT. We found T2∗ MRI technique a quite beneficial method for following up the patients after transplantation. Obviously, planning large controlled trials associated with liver biopsy results after transplantation is required.

Abstract: The congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of muscle disorders. Clinically hypotonia is present from birth, with progressive muscle weakness and wasting through development. For the most part, CMDs can mechanistically be attributed to failure of basement membrane protein laminin-α2 sufficiently binding with correctly glycosylated α-dystroglycan. The majority of CMDs therefore arise as the result of either a deficiency of laminin-α2 (MDC1A) or hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan (dystroglycanopathy). Here we consider whether by filling a regenerative medicine niche, the zebrafish model can address the present challenge of delivering novel therapeutic solutions for CMD. In the first instance the readiness and appropriateness of the zebrafish as a model organism for pioneering regenerative medicine therapies in CMD is analysed, in particular for MDC1A and the dystroglycanopathies. Despite the recent rapid progress made in gene editing technology, these approaches have yet to yield any novel zebrafish models of CMD. Currently the most genetically relevant zebrafish models to the field of CMD, have all been created by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis. Once genetically relevant models have been established the zebrafish has several important facets for investigating the mechanistic cause of CMD, including rapid ex vivo development, optical transparency up to the larval stages of development and relative ease in creating transgenic reporter lines. Together, these tools are well suited for use in live-imaging studies such as in vivo modelling of muscle fibre detachment. Secondly, the zebrafish's contribution to progress in effective treatment of CMD was analysed. Two approaches were identified in which zebrafish could potentially contribute to effective therapies. The first hinges on the augmentation of functional redundancy within the system, such as upregulating alternative laminin chains in the candyfloss fish, a model of MDC1A. Secondly high-throughput small molecule screens not only provide effective therapies, but also an alternative strategy for investigating CMD in zebrafish. In this instance insight into disease mechanism is derived in reverse. Zebrafish models are therefore clearly of critical importance in the advancement of regenerative medicine strategies in CMD.

Abstract: We combine inkjet printed silver grids and reverse nanoimprinting transfer to demonstrate front electrode structures embedded within the substrate for indium tin oxide (ITO) replacement in organic solar cells. The smooth interface between Ag grid and transparent semiconductor polymer PEDOT:PSS improves the topology of the successive layers. In turn, this results in overall good photovoltaic performance including high fill factor and no shunting. By modelling the shadowing and resistive losses as a function of the separation between grid lines, the optimal grid structure is identified, which we then confirm experimentally. Inkjet printed ITO-free solar cells showed slightly higher performance than the ITO based reference.

Abstract: Several different form-stable phase change materials (FSPCMs), which comprise microencapsulated phase change materials (MEPCMs) as latent heat storage medium and poly(vinyl chloride)/wood flour compound as supporting material, were prepared by blending and compression molding method for the application of potential latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES). SEM images reveal that prepared FSPCMs have homogeneous constitution and most MEPCM particles in them are undamaged. Both the shell of MEPCM and the matrix prevent the molten paraffin from leakage. DSC results show that melting and freezing temperatures as well as latent heats of the prepared FSPCMs are suitable for potential LHTES applications. Results of thermal performance tests show that the surface temperature fluctuation of the FSPCMs is obviously less than that of plate without MEPCM. Results of mechanical property tests indicate that bending strength, and bending modulus, as well as tensile and impact strength of the FSPCMs with 10wt% MEPCM are 26.7MPa, 3.48GPa, 9.8MPa and 10kJm−2 respectively. The mechanical properties of FSPCMs with poly(vinyl chloride)/wood flour compound as supporting material are superior to those of HDPE-based FSPCMs.

Abstract: Cancer cell metabolism differs from that of non-transformed cells in the same tissue. This specific metabolism gives tumor cells growing advantages besides the effect in increasing anabolism. One of these advantages is immune evasion mediated by a lower expression of the mayor histocompatibility complex class I molecules. The extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 regulates both mayor histocompatibility complex class I expression and metabolic activity. However, the mechanisms underlying are largely unknown. We show here that extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 regulates the transcription of the NADH+-dependent histone deacetylase silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Sirtuin 1) in leukemic Jurkat T cells. This involves the activation of the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor-2 and its binding to the sirt1 promoter. In addition, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 is required for T cell receptor-induced and oxidative stress-induced full Sirtuin 1 expression. Extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 induces the expression of promoters containing the antioxidant response elements through a Sirtuin 1-dependent pathway. On the other hand, down modulation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 expression impairs the anti-oxidant response. Notably, the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase-5 inhibitor BIX02189 induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia tumor cells without affecting T cells from healthy donors. Our results unveil a new pathway that modulates metabolism in tumor cells. This pathway represents a promising therapeutic target in cancers with deep metabolic layouts such as acute myeloid leukemia.

Abstract: The BCL6 gene, which is expressed in certain B- and T-cell human lymphomas, is involved with chromosomal rearrangements and mutations in a number of these neoplasms. Lymphomagenesis is believed to evolve through a multi-step accumulation of genetic alterations in these tumors. We used retroviral insertional mutagenesis in transgenic mice expressing the human BCL6 transgene in order to identify genes that cooperate with BCL6 during lymphomatous transformation. We previously reported PIM1 as the most frequently recurring cooperating gene in this model. We now report three newly identified cooperating genes—GFI1B, EVI5, and MYB—that we identified in the lymphomas of retroviral-injected BCL6 transgenic mice (but not in retroviral-injected non-transgenic controls); mRNA and protein expression of GFI1B and EVI5 were decreased in the murine tumors, whereas MYB mRNA and protein expression were increased or decreased. These findings correlated with protein expression in human lymphomas, both B- and T-cell. Improved therapy of lymphomas may necessitate the development of combinations of drugs that target the alterations specific to each neoplasm.

Abstract: Vertically-aligned silicon nanowires (VA-SiNWs) realized with vacuum metal-assisted chemical etching are demonstrated to be the better candidate for optical manipulation due to their superior physical and optical properties. The length-dependent volume filling factor of as-grown VA-SiNWs agrees with the theoretically optimal conditions which lead to the lowest surface reflectance in visible spectral region. Growing a thin thermal oxide with an appropriate thickness on the surface of VA-SiNWs could further improve the antireflective performance in near-infrared wavelengths. We also demonstrated that the surface reflectance could be adjusted without sacrificing the bandwidth of its antireflective window by tuning the bundle filling factor of two-dimensional VA-SiNW bundle array. Such a flexible surface reflectance cannot be obtained by simply adjusting the physical parameters of planar VA-SiNWs. For implementing SiNW-based solar cells, a pre-patterning method is conducted to enable the formation of antireflective VA-SiNW surfaces at energy-harvesting areas while maintaining planar silicon surfaces at the metallization areas to avoid high electrical contact resistivity over SiNW surfaces. Nanowire-based solar cell shows an 18% increased short-circuit current and a 10% improved overall efficiency compared to the reference cell with a planar silicon top surface.

Low-dose splenic radiation inhibits liver tumor development of rats through functional changes in CD4+CD25+Treg cells,

Abstract: The increased number of CD4+CD25+Treg cells in tumor local and peripheral splenic tissues is related to the low immune function as well as to tumor recurrence and metastasis. Our pre-clinical studies showed that low-dose radiation (LDR) of the spleen in liver cancer patients significantly improves immune functions. However, the molecular mechanisms of such radiation remained ill defined. This study explores the role of CD4+CD25+Treg cells in radiation-induced immunomodulatory effects. Using the diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat liver tumor model and in vitro cell experiments, the percentage of CD4+CD25+Treg/CD4+ cells in the blood and the expressions of Foxp3+, IL-10, TGF-β, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4(CTLA-4) in spleen and liver tumors significantly decreased after LDR of the spleen in rats with liver cancer. The tumors became smaller than those in the non-radiated group, with both showing a parallel relation. Flow cytometry and MTT results revealed that LDR failed to inhibit CD4+CD25+Treg cell proliferation. Conversely, apoptosis was reduced and proliferation was stimulated. This process also changed CTLA-4 molecule expression on the surfaces of CD4+CD25+Treg cells and reduced their inhibitory function against CD4+CD25−T cell proliferation, and the suppression function of CD4+CD25+Treg cells was further weakened with the introduction of the CTLA-4 inhibitor. Findings demonstrate that the reduction of CTLA-4 expression on the CD4+CD25+Treg cell surface and the further inhibition of cell function may be considered as important regulators of LDR-induced immunomodulatory effects. This study provides experimental evidence to elucidate the immune enhancement induced by this process and presents a novel method for liver cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: The performance of organic and hybrid solar cells is, in addition to the properties of the absorber layer, also strongly dependent on electrodes and interlayers extracting the charges generated in the absorber layer. Here, we investigate Ti and TiOx interlayers regarding the performance and stability of polymer/copper indium sulfide hybrid solar cells with aluminum and silver electrodes. For this, TiOx interlayers were prepared via thermal evaporation of titanium under moderate vacuum conditions in oxygen containing atmosphere, whereas Ti interlayers were deposited under high vacuum conditions. The titanium-based interlayers improved the power conversion efficiencies of solar cells with Al as well as with Ag electrodes. Also the stability of solar cells with Al electrodes was improved; however, solar cells with Ag electrodes and TiOx as well as Ti interlayers turned out to be much more stable and showed lifetimes of several thousand hours under continuous illumination.

Abstract: Objective
Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common Mendelian disorder of iron metabolism. Eighty percent of northern Europeans descendant HH patients carry the same mutation (p.C282Y) in the HFE gene. Simultaneously, due to a founder effect, its frequency varies considerably between different populations. In Central-Southern Italy the prevalence of p.C282Y mutation is low and in several patients the disease has different causes. Four additional rarer forms have been described. Type 3 HH has been reported in about 50 families and no more than 30 TFR2 pathogenic mutations have been globally identified. The aim of this study is to assess the TFR2 role in non-HFE HH pathogenesis.
Study design and setting
TFR2 sequence analysis was performed on 45 Italian patients without HFE mutations.
Results
This study revealed TFR2 biallelic pathogenic mutations in 7/45 (15.6%) individuals. Moreover monoallelic TFR2 deleterious defects (18%) or polymorphisms with unclear meaning (36%) were identified. Besides, we recognized 10 novel variants and 9 described changes.
Conclusion
We believe this to be the largest series of type 3 HH patients described so far. Present findings support the hypothesis of a main role of the TFR2 gene in HH pathogenesis in those regions, such as Central-Southern Italy, where the p.C282Y frequency is low.

Abstract: For optimal performance, the intermediate window layer in multijunction photovoltaics should transmit as much light as possible to guarantee maximum device efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that indium molybdenum oxide (IMO) is a more suitable intermediate layer, compared to indium tin oxide (ITO), as it would absorb significantly less infrared light with comparable electrical conductivity once integrated into a multijunction solar cell. In fact, we show that IMO optoelectronic properties are virtually unchanged by the typical thermal budgets used in solar absorber deposition processes used in low-cost high-performance multijunction photovoltaics (e.g. CuInGaSe2). Specifically, IMO and ITO thin films were reactively sputtered onto glass substrates at 150°C, then subjected to a vacuum annealing process (550°C, 2h) identical to that of co-evaporated copper gallium diselenide (CGSe), a candidate material for the top absorber in multijunction cells. We found that annealing substantially reduces the infrared transmittance of ITO starting at 900nm, reducing by 2.5% per 100nm, while IMO only started experiencing a reduction at 1400nm and decaying more slowly at 1.6% per 100nm. Furthermore, the resistivity of IMO was comparable to that of ITO after annealing. The resilience of IMO to such high temperature processes show that it has potential to enhance the performance of multijunction devices.

Abstract: The circadian clock influences nearly all aspects of metabolism. However, little is known regarding the effect of the energy status on circadian rhythms. Our aim was to test the effect of two opposing energy situations, metformin and lipid emulsion (LE), on clock and metabolic circadian expression in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. Metformin treatment led to depleted ATP levels accompanied by elevated NADH levels, whereas LE treatment led to increased ATP and NAD+ levels. Nevertheless, both LE and metformin treatments activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In contrast, the effect on circadian rhythms was completely different. LE led to disrupted clock and metabolic gene expression, whereas metformin led to mainly high-amplitude shifted rhythms. Combination of metformin and LE led to an antagonistic effect on circadian gene expression. Although metformin and LE have an opposing effect on circadian gene expression and on the cellular energy status, they both lead to AMPK activation.

Abstract: Hyperglycemia is involved in the diabetic complication of different organs and can elevate serum osmolarity. Here, we tested whether hyperosmolarity promoted by high glucose levels induces cellular senescence in renal cells. We treated Wistar rats with streptozotocin to induce diabetes or with consecutive daily injections of mannitol to increase serum osmolarity and analyzed p53 and p16 genes in renal cortex by immunohistochemistry. Both diabetic and mannitol treated rats showed a significant increase in serum osmolarity, without significant signs of renal dysfunction, but associated with increased staining for p53 and p16 in the renal cortex. An increase in p53 and p16 expression was also found in renal cortex slices and glomeruli isolated from healthy rats, which were later treated with 30mM glucose or mannitol. Intracellular mechanisms involved were analyzed in cultured human glomerular mesangial cells treated with 30mM glucose or mannitol. After treatments, cells showed increased p53, p21 and p16 expression and elevated senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Senescence was prevented when myo-inositol was added before treatment. High glucose or mannitol induced constitutive activation of Ras and ERK pathways which, in turn, were activated by oxidative stress. In summary, hyperosmolarity induced renal senescence, particularly in glomerular mesangial cells, increasing oxidative stress, which constitutively activated Ras-ERK 1/2 pathway. Cellular senescence could contribute to the organ dysfunction associated with diabetes.

Abstract: Alleviation of hyperglycemia in chemical-induced diabetic mice has been reported after bone marrow transplantation. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we transplanted genetically labeled primary mouse mesenchymal stem cells into the pancreas of the streptozotocin-treated hyperglycemic isogeneic mice, resulting in a decrease in blood glucose due to a recovery in beta cell mass. Further analysis revealed that the increase in beta cell mass was predominantly attributable to beta cell replication. The grafted mesenchymal stem cells did not transdifferentiate into beta cells themselves but recruited and polarized macrophages in a Stromal cell-derived factor 1-dependent manner, which in turn promoted beta cell replication. Our finding thus suggests that transplantation of autogenic mesenchymal stem cells may increase functional beta cell mass by boosting beta cell replication in diabetes.

HOXB5 binds to multi-species conserved sequence (MCS+9.7) of RET gene and regulates RET expression,

Abstract: RET gene is crucial for the development of enteric nervous system, and dys-regulation of RET expression causes Hirschsprung disease. HOXB5 regulates RET transcription, and perturbations in transcriptional regulation by HOXB5 caused reduced RET expression and defective enteric nervous system development in mice. The mechanisms by which HOXB5 regulate RET transcription are unclear. Thus, unraveling the regulatory mechanisms of HOXB5 on RET transcription could lead to a better understanding of the etiology of Hirschsprung disease. In this study, we identified and confirmed HOXB5 binding to the multi-species conserved sequence (MCS+9.7) in the first intron of the RET gene. We developed a RET mini-gene reporter system, and showed that MCS+9.7 enhanced HOXB5 trans-activation from RET promoter in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and in chick embryos. The deletion of HOXB5 binding site interfered with HOXB5 trans-activation. Furthermore, transfection of HOXB5 induced endogenous RET transcription, enhanced the co-precipitation of TATA-box binding protein with the transcription start site of RET, and induced histone H3K4 trimethylation in chromatin regions upstream and downstream of RET transcription start site. In conclusion, (i) HOXB5 physically interacted with MCS+9.7 and enhanced RET transcription, (ii) HOXB5 altered chromatin conformation and histone modification of RET locus, which could facilitate the formation of transcription complex, and enhance RET transcription, (iii) expression of RET was mediated by a complex regulatory network of transcription factors functioning in a synergistic, additive and/or independent manners. Hence, dys-regulation of RET expression by HOXB5 could result in insufficient RET expression and Hirschsprung disease.

Abstract: S100A6 is a calcium binding protein expressed in many types of epithelia including epidermis. S100A6 is a binding partner of a number of proteins engaged in cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle control, stress response or apoptosis. So far the effect of its overexpression or knock-down on cell physiology has been studied only at the cellular level. Here, we used an in vitro model of differentiating epidermis to study the role of S100A6 at the tissue level and in the context of tissue differentiation. First of all we have shown that S100A6 mRNA level diminished several fold during primary keratinocyte differentiation and investigated the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms involved in this tight expression control. Using bisulfite treatment, luciferase assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation we found that changes in S100A6 expression were DNA methylation independent but could be orchestrated by epidermal specific factors: the ΔNp63 transcription factor and retinoic acid. To investigate if the drop-down in S100A6 expression is indeed critical for keratinocyte differentiation we developed HaCaT cells with stable S100A6 knock-down or overexpression and tested them in 2- and 3-dimensional (organotypic) culture conditions. S100A6 overexpressing cells exhibited accelerated proliferation, enhanced adhesion properties and suppressed loricrin expression – features typical for undifferentiated keratinocytes. In organotypic culture these cells formed thicker epidermis with more Ki67 positive cells, keratin 10 expression spatially limited to the uppermost cell layers and non-detectable loricrin expression. Together, results obtained in both culture models proved that increased S100A6 content in keratinocytes dramatically changed the pace and extent of epidermal differentiation.

Abstract: A buffer layer based on a Te/Cu bi-layer useful for forming ohmic contact to p-CdTe has been developed for application in CdS/CdTe solar cells. The bi-layer buffer was prepared by vapor deposition and a thermal annealing (~200°C) was required for activation. Enhanced efficiency and stability were obtained by optimizing the Cu/Te compositions and the thermal activation conditions. Characterization by XRD, XPS, and PL indicates that under the thermal activation conditions Cu diffuses rapidly in the Te without forming CuxTe compounds. The enhanced stability can be attributed to the mediation of Cu diffusion into CdTe by the Te layer. The Te/Cu buffers are particularly useful for the fabrication of ultra-thin CdS/CdTe solar cells.

Abstract: High altitude exerts selective evolutionary pressure primarily due to its hypoxic environment, resulting in multiple adaptive responses. High hemoglobin–oxygen affinity is postulated to be one such adaptive change, which has been reported in Sherpas of the Himalayas. Tibetans have lived on the Qinghai–Tibetan plateau for thousands of years and have developed unique phenotypes, such as protection from polycythemia which has been linked to PDH2 mutation, resulting in the downregulation of the HIF pathway. In order to see if Tibetans also developed high hemoglobin–oxygen affinity as a part of their genetic adaptation, we conducted this study assessing hemoglobin–oxygen affinity and their fetal hemoglobin levels in Tibetan subjects from 3 different altitudes. We found normal hemoglobin–oxygen affinity in all subjects, fetal hemoglobin levels were normal in all except one and no hemoglobin variants in any of the subjects. We conclude that increased hemoglobin–oxygen affinity or increased fetal hemoglobin are not adaptive phenotypes of the Tibetan highlanders.

Abstract: Background
Bone marrow infiltration by substrate-engorged “Gaucher” cells manifests early in Gaucher disease (GD). The impact of velaglucerase alfa on bone marrow burden (BMB) was evaluated as an exploratory assessment.
Methods
BMB scores were assessed using T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images of the lumbar spine (LS) and femora among symptomatic GD patients who participated in the 9-month Phase I/II trial and long-term extension study for velaglucerase alfa. A post-hoc assessment of marrow involvement was performed. BMB scores per site are 0–8 (0/1=normal; 8=severe infiltration).
Results
The median LS-BMB score at baseline was 6 (n=12; range 3–8); at 9months, compared with baseline, there was a median change of −2 (n=11; two-sided p-value=0.0078). LS-BMB scores continued to decrease through 5years (n=8; median change from baseline −5 [p=0.0078], median score 1 [range 1–4]) and were subsequently sustained through 7years (n=8). LS-BMB decreases of ≥2 points occurred in 6/11 patients at 9months, and in all assessable patients (8/8) by 5years. Long-term femoral BMB (F-BMB) assessment was possible for three patients; all experienced reductions of ≥2 points at 5years with a total score (LS-BMB+F-BMB) decrease ≥4.
Conclusions
This post hoc analysis suggests improvement in BMB scores through 5years that was sustained through 7years, despite dose reduction from 15months. Prospective studies in a large cohort are needed to validate these findings.

Abstract: The power conversion efficiency (PCE) improvement of III–V gallium arsenide (GaAs) single-junction (SJ) solar cells with titanium dioxide (TiO2) subwavelength structures (SWSs) as antireflection coatings (ARCs) is reported. TiO2 SWSs are fabricated by dry etching using dotted gold nanopatterns prepared with glancing angle deposition and thermal dewetting processes. Their optical reflection properties are studied in the wavelength range of 350–900nm at incident light angles (θi) of 3–80°, together with the theoretical prediction by a rigorous coupled-wave analysis. For SWSs on the 50nm-thick TiO2 layer/GaAs substrate, a lower solar weighted reflectance (SWR) of ~6.2% is obtained compared to that (i.e., SWR ~9.5%) of the TiO2 single-layer ARC (SLARC). By employing the TiO2 SWSs into the III–V GaAs SJ solar cell, the increased short circuit current density (Jsc) of 24.82mA/cm2 is achieved, thus leading to an improved PCE of 19.66% at θi=0° (i.e., Jsc=18.38 and 23.65mA/cm2 and PCE=14.74 and 18.98% for the solar cells with bare surface and TiO2 SLARC, respectively). For incident angle-dependent device characteristics, the solar cell with the TiO2 SWSs also exhibits superior performance over a wide θi range of 20–80°. Additionally, after the encapsulation, its Jsc and PCE values are slightly increased to 26.15mA/cm2 and 20.73%, respectively. For the stability, there are no significant variations in Jsc and PCE after about 50 days.

Abstract: abstract
A highly resolving micro-light beam-induced current (µLBIC)-system is presented in this work. Based on the laser excitation via an optical microscope, current values can be measured with sub-micron precision. We show, that this non-destructive, light-based approach delivers superior results to a reference electron microscope based electron beam induced current method concerning contrast and robustness towards reflection differences, whereas no vacuum is needed, no charging effects can occur and equal resolution is achieved. µLBIC allows therefore mapping of pn-junctions at silicon solar cell cross sections. By combination of µLBIC with other measurement methods in the same setup, such as micro-Raman spectroscopy, complementary microscopic information about material stress or crystallinity and electronic properties at the same region of interest on the sample is revealed. By applying µLBIC for analyzing silicon solar cross sections, two characterization examples of current technological relevance are presented: enhanced dopant diffusion along grain boundaries between grains with different orientations is quantified and the impact of a nickel silicide spike on local charge collection quality is studied.

Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the potentiality to produce solar cells based in earth abundant materials deposited onto low weight and flexible stainless steel substrates. Due to the increasing interest of kesterite absorbers like those formed by Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4, we deposited Cu2ZnSnSe4 layers by a two stage method onto stainless steel substrates coated with a Chromium diffusion barrier, a Mo back contact and a ZnO intermediate layer as substrate configuration, obtaining photovoltaic grade absorbers. First preliminary results, using thermal treatments optimized for glass substrates, lead to a 3.5% efficiency solar cell. This is a promising result, showing the potentiality of this low cost technology for the development of devices onto flexible and low weight substrates, compatible with roll-to-roll industrial implementation.

Abstract: The successful realization of carrier-selective contacts is a crucial prerequisite to approaching the theoretical efficiency limit of silicon solar cells. The herein proposed carrier-selective contacts resemble the polysilicon contacts, including a tunnel oxide, but make use of a wide bandgap semi-crystalline Si layer thereby forming a heterostructure with the crystalline silicon substrate. It will be shown that these tunnel oxide passivated contacts enable a low interface recombination, e.g. the electron contact achieved implied Voc (iVoc) of about 720mV. On the other hand, the interface passivation quality provided by the hole contact was significantly lower (iVoc=680mV) and it seems that its design is more challenging. The critical aspects which might explain the lower performance are addressed in this paper. On solar cell level good carrier selectivity was demonstrated which means that the passivated contacts effectively reduced minority carrier recombination and were transparent for majority carriers as well. The latter manifests itself in an external Voc of 694mV and a FF of 81%. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the Si layer can partially contain crystalline Si phases and it will be demonstrated that this significantly improved the cell׳s blue response. In combination with the higher thermal stability these carrier-selective contacts could be a very appealing option for next generation high-efficiency silicon solar cells once the limitations for the p-contact are overcome.

Abstract: In recent years, widespread antisense transcripts have been identified systematically in mammalian cells and are known to regulate gene expression, although their functional significance remains largely unknown. Previous work has identified that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is expressed aberrantly in various malignant tumors and function as a tumor growth suppressor. However, the mechanism of AChE gene regulation in tumors remains unclear. In this study, we show that the AChE antisense RNA (AChE-AS) play an important role in AChE expression regulation. An inverse relationship was identified between AChE-AS and AChE expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatoma cells. The silenced AChE-AS corresponds to elevated expression of AChE. Furthermore, we demonstrated that reduced AChE-AS increased H3K4 methylation and decreased H3K9 methylation in the AChE promoter region. As expected, elevated AChE levels induced by inhibition of AChE-AS enhanced anticarcinogen-induced apoptosis. These observations demonstrated that AChE-AS modulates AChE expression and exerts an anti-apoptotic effect through direct repression of AChE expression in HCC cells. Thus, natural antisense RNA may play an important role in AChE regulation via affecting the epigenetic modification in the AChE promoter region.

Abstract: Cu2S/CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2 (Cu2S/CIGS) core/shell nanowire arrays with epitaxial CIGS growth are synthesized by electrodepositing CIGS on Cu2S nanowire arrays. The electrodeposited CIGS is tetragonal CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2 with a band gap of 1.310eV. The crystal structure of Cu2S is similar to that of CIGS. The interplanar distance of Cu2S (2¯04) is also similar to that of CIGS (112), so the CIGS shell grows epitaxially. Absorption measurements show that Cu2S/CIGS core/shell nanowire arrays exhibit higher light absorption than Cu2S nanowire arrays. Fabricating Cu2S/CIGS core/shell nanowire arrays with epitaxial CIGS growth shows promise for the preparation of single crystal CIGS one-dimensional nanostructures.

Abstract: The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as a host innate immune defence mechanism has been shown to be the result of a novel cell death process called NETosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of cholesterol in the formation of NETs. To this end, primary human neutrophils were treated with different concentrations of methy-β-cyclodetxrin (MβCD) to reduce cholesterol level in the cell. The formation of NETs was studied using immunofluorescence microscopy and Picogreen-quantification of released dsDNA. Neutrophils treated with MβCD showed a significant release of NETs in a process that is independent of NADPH-oxidase. The effect of MβCD on the lipid composition of the cells was determined using high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC). The identities of lipids separated by HPTLC were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Treatment of neutrophils with MβCD revealed distinct changes in the lipid composition: The percentage of cholesterol in the cell was significantly reduced; other lipids as sphingomyelin were only slightly affected. Interestingly, neutrophils treated with sphingomyelin-degrading sphingomyelinase also showed significant release of NETs. In conclusion, this study shows that lipid alterations facilitate formation of NETs.

Abstract: Mutations in the human actin depolymerizing factor cofilin2 result in an autosomal dominant form of nemaline myopathy. Here, we report on the targeted ablation of murine cofilin2, which leads to a severe skeletal muscle specific phenotype within the first two weeks after birth. Apart from skeletal muscle, cofilin2 is also expressed in heart and CNS, however the pathology was restricted to skeletal muscle. The two close family members of cofilin2 – ADF and cofilin1 – were co-expressed in muscle, but unable to compensate for the loss of cofilin2. While primary myofibril assembly and muscle development were unaffected in cofilin2 mutant mice, progressive muscle degeneration was observed between postnatal days 3 and 7. Muscle pathology was characterized by sarcoplasmic protein aggregates, fiber size disproportion, mitochondrial abnormalities and internal nuclei. The observed muscle pathology differed from nemaline myopathy, but showed combined features of actin-associated myopathy and myofibrillar myopathy. In cofilin2 mutant mice, the postnatal expression pattern and turnover of sarcomeric α-actin isoforms were altered. Levels of smooth muscle α-actin were increased and remained high in developing muscles, suggesting that cofilin2 plays a crucial role during the exchange of α-actin isoforms during the early postnatal remodeling of the sarcomere.

Abstract: The primary function of Arp2/3 complex is the generation of free barbed ends by nucleating new filaments from the sides of pre-existing filaments. The pathway of branch formation is complex and involves nucleation promoting factors, actin monomers and nucleotides. A less prominent function of Arp2/3 complex is capping of actin filament pointed ends. Here we show, using electron microscopy, electron tomography, and image reconstruction of negatively-stained samples at ∼2–3nm resolution, that Arp2/3 complex bound to the pointed ends of actin filaments has a conformation similar to that in the branch junction with the Arps arranged in an actin-filament like configuration. This is direct evidence for the existence of two distinct activation pathways for Arp2/3 complex, one in the context of branch formation, one in the context of pointed-end capping, with essentially the same conformational end point.

Dual blockade of the A1 and A2A adenosine receptor prevents amyloid beta toxicity in neuroblastoma cells exposed to aluminum chloride,

Abstract: In a previous work we have shown that exposure to aluminum (Al) chloride (AlCl3) enhanced the neurotoxicity of the amyloid beta25-35 fragment (Abeta25-35) in neuroblastoma cells and affected the expression of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related genes. Caffein, a compound endowed with beneficial effects against AD, exerts neuroprotection primarily through its antagonist activity on A2A adenosine receptors (A2AR), although it also inhibits A1Rs with similar potency. Still, studies on the specific involvement of these receptors in neuroprotection in a model of combined neurotoxicity (Abeta25-35+AlCl3) are missing. To address this issue, cultured SH-SY5Y cells exposed to Abeta25-35+AlCl3 were assessed for cell viability, morphology, intracellular ROS activity and expression of apoptosis-, stress- and AD-related proteins. To define the role of A1R and A2ARs, pretreatment with caffein, specific receptor antagonists (DPCPX or SCH58261) or siRNA-mediated gene knockdown were delivered. Results indicate that AlCl3 treatment exacerbated Abeta25-35 toxicity, increased ROS production, lipid peroxidation, β-secretase-1 (BACE1) and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Interestingly, SCH58261 successfully prevented toxicity associated to Abeta25-35 only, whereas pretreatment with both DPCPX and SCH58261 was required to fully avert Abeta25-35+AlCl3-induced damage, suggesting that A1Rs might also be critically involved in protection during combined toxicity. The effects of caffein were mimicked by both N-acetyl cysteine, an antioxidant, and desferrioxamine, likely acting through distinct mechanisms. Altogether, our data establish a novel protective function associated with A1R inhibition in the setting of combined Abeta25-35+AlCl3 neurotoxicity, and expand our current knowledge on the potential beneficial role of caffein to prevent AD progression in subjects environmentally exposed to aluminum.

Abstract: Obestatin, its N-terminal fragment and the N-terminal fragment analog Nt8U were previously shown to reduce food intake, gain in body weight and triglyceride levels in albino mice. To establish their mode of action, mRNA profiling of the epididymal adipose tissue of mice treated with these peptides were performed. The differential expressions were markedly indicative of their involvement in lipid metabolism. Obestatin showed a significant upregulation of the genes patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2, monoglyceride lipase, aldo–keto reductase family 1, member 7 which are involved in glycerolipid metabolism. It also upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, retinoid X receptor gamma, cluster of differentiation 36, adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain containing, angiopoietin-like 4, lipoprotein lipase, stearoyl-coenzyme A and desaturase 3 involved in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway. Nt8U upregulated genes implicated in the same two pathways but with lesser significance and also upregulated APOL2. The N-terminal fragment though differentially regulated a small subset of the genes differentially regulated by obestatin and Nt8U, no conclusive evidence was obtained as to assign a specific pathway for its mode of action. We hypothesize that reduced food intake brought about by obestatin and Nt8U triggers lipid catabolism. The free fatty acids and lysophosphatidic acid thus produced in turn activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and the genes involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling. All of them together lead to reduction in gain in bodyweight, stored fat and circulating lipids. These results also correlate well with the observed efficacy of the peptides.

Abstract: A series of solution-processable small molecules were designed and synthesized with 2-pyran-4-ylidenemalononitrile (PM) as electron-withdrawing group and oligothiophene as electron-donating group. On this basis, –C8H17 (C8), –C6H13 (C6), and –C4H9 (C4) were introduced into the conjugated molecules to investigate the effects of alkyl chain length on thermal, optical, electrochemical properties and photovoltaic performance of these small molecules. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement indicated that the melting points increased gradually as alkyl chain length shortened from C8, C6 to C4. Ultraviolet and visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra demonstrated that alkyl chain length negligibly influenced the conjugation effect of organic small molecules but displayed a limited effect on the molecule π–π stacking according to their disparate absorption spectrum shapes. Optical density investigation revealed that it could be a promising approach to enhance light absorption by shortening alkyl chain length. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) investigation indicated that alkyl chain length slightly affects the oxidation and reduction potential of these small molecules, which can be explained by their similar conjugated chain. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that it could be an effective way to adjust slightly the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the organic small molecule. Photovoltaic device based on 8TPMC4 displayed the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.18%, which proves it to be a feasible method to improve photovoltaic performance by adjusting the alkyl chain length of donor materials.

Abstract: In congenital Chuvash polycythemia (CP), VHLR200W homozygosity leads to elevated hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) levels at normoxia. CP is often treated by phlebotomy resulting in iron deficiency, permitting us to examine the separate and synergistic effects of iron deficiency and HIF signaling on gene expression. We compared peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression profiles of eight VHLR200W homozygotes with 17 wildtype individuals with normal iron status and found 812 up-regulated and 2120 down-regulated genes at false discovery rate of 0.05. Among differential genes we identified three major gene regulation modules involving induction of innate immune responses, alteration of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and down-regulation of cell proliferation, stress-induced apoptosis and T-cell activation. These observations suggest molecular mechanisms for previous observations in CP of lower blood sugar without increased insulin and low oncogenic potential. Studies including 16 additional VHLR200W homozygotes with low ferritin indicated that iron deficiency enhanced the induction effect of VHLR200W for 50 genes including hemoglobin synthesis loci but suppressed the effect for 107 genes enriched for HIF-2 targets. This pattern is consistent with potentiation of HIF-1α protein stability by iron deficiency but a trend for down-regulation of HIF-2α translation by iron deficiency overriding an increase in HIF-2α protein stability.

Abstract: We have reviewed the literature to identify and characterize reports of warm-antibody type, autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which the standard direct antiglobulin reaction was negative but a confirmatory test indicated that the red cells were opsonized with antibody. Three principal reasons account for the absence of a positive direct antiglobulin test in these cases: a) IgG sensitization below the threshold of detection by the commercial antiglobulin reagent, b) low affinity IgG, removed by preparatory washes not conducted at 4°C or at low ionic strength, and c) red cell sensitization by IgA alone, or rarely (monomeric) IgM alone, but not accompanied by complement fixation, and thus not detectable by a commercial antiglobulin reagent that contains anti-IgG and anti-C3. In cases in which the phenotype is compatible with warm-antibody type, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and the direct antiglobulin test is negative, an alternative method to detect low levels of IgG sensitization, use of 4°C, low ionic strength washes to prepare the cells for the direct antiglobulin test reaction to permit retention and identification of low affinity IgG antibodies, and, if the latter are uninformative, testing for sensitization with an anti-IgA, and, if necessary, an anti-IgM reagent identifies cases of warm-antibody type, immune hemolysis not verified by a commercial reagent.

Abstract: We report the properties of nanocrystalline silicon nip solar cells deposited onto two types of silver/zinc oxide backreflector with substantially different morphologies and reflectances. For both types, the short-circuit photocurrent density JSC under AM 1.5 sunlight was 25mA/cm2 for 1.5μm thick cells, which is indicative of excellent light scattering. The external quantum efficiency spectra of the finished cells were only slightly affected by these differences in the backreflectors. Details of the backreflector morphology are unimportant if light-trapping is thermodynamic or ergodic, and scattering establishes equipartition of the optical energy between the different electromagnetic modes of the cell. We extended previous thermodynamic calculations of cell absorptance to incorporate the parasitic losses from the front conducting oxide coating and to accommodate some specular reflectance by the cells. The calculations account well for the quantum efficiency and reflectance spectra of the cells. Comparing the calculations with the experimental data, we conclude that multimode losses in the top oxide coating account for about half of the difference between the ideal “4n2” thermodynamic photocurrent and the smaller values in the cells, where n is the refractive index of the cells׳ absorber layer.

Abstract: In this study, we prepared organic solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with electrochemically deposited nano polyaniline (PANI) buffer layers (either PANI – 0.1M or PANI – 0.3M) as hole transporting layers and compared their performances with those of solar cells lacking the buffer layer (i.e., bare ITO) or featuring buffer layers of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) or PEDOT:PSS-covered PANI. The power conversion efficiency of the device featuring PANI/PEDOT:PSS as the buffer layer (2.76%) was greater than those of devices featuring bare ITO (0.75%) or the PANI – 0.1M (1.33%), PANI – 0.3M (1.78%), or PEDOT:PSS (2.30%) layers. We suspect that the increased conductivity of the PANI/PEDOT:PSS composite, caused by interactions between the PANI nitrogen atoms and the functional groups of PSS, led to additional doping of PANI. This primary doping effect by PSS toward PANI lowered the series resistance of the PANI/PEDOT:PSS buffer layer and, thereby, increased the photocurrent of the device. As a result, electrochemically deposited PANI buffer layers, with or without PEDOT:PSS, appear to be promising hole transporting layers for organic electronic devices that require different candidate materials (other than PEDOT:PSS conductors) and/or different processing conditions (other than spin-coating).

Abstract: Benign fibrous histiocytoma (BFH) is a mesenchymal tumor that most often occurs in the skin (so-called dermatofibroma), but may also appear in soft tissues (so-called deep BFH) and in the skeleton (so-called non-ossifying fibroma). The origin of BFH is unknown, and it has been questioned whether it is a true neoplasm. Chromosome banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, RNA sequencing, RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR were used to search for recurrent somatic mutations in a series of BFH. BFHs were found to harbor recurrent fusions of genes encoding membrane-associated proteins (podoplanin, CD63 and LAMTOR1) with genes encoding protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms PRKCB and PRKCD. PKCs are serine–threonine kinases that through their many phosphorylation targets are implicated in a variety of cellular processes, as well as tumor development. When inactive, the amino-terminal, regulatory domain of PKCs suppresses the activity of their catalytic domain. Upon activation, which requires several steps, they typically translocate to cell membranes, where they interact with different signaling pathways. The detected PDPN-PRKCB, CD63-PRKCD and LAMTOR1-PRKCD gene fusions are all predicted to result in chimeric proteins consisting of the membrane-binding part of PDPN, CD63 or LAMTOR1 and the entire catalytic domain of the PKC. This novel pathogenetic mechanism should result in constitutive kinase activity at an ectopic location. The results show that BFH indeed is a true neoplasm, and that distorted PKC activity is essential for tumorigenesis. The findings also provide means to differentiate BFH from other skin and soft tissue tumors. This article is part of a Directed Issue entitled: Rare cancers.

Abstract: Junction-mediating and regulatory protein (JMY) was originally identified as a transcriptional co-factor in the p53-response to DNA damage. Aside from this nuclear function, recent years have uncovered an additional function of JMY, namely in cytoskeleton remodelling and actin assembly. The C-terminus of JMY comprises a canonical VCA-module, the sequence signature of Arp2/3 complex activators. Furthermore, tandem repeats of 3 WH2 (V, or more recently also W) domains render JMY capable of Arp2/3 independent actin assembly. The motility promoting cytoplasmic function of JMY is abrogated upon DNA-damage and nuclear translocation of JMY. To address the precise cellular function of JMY in cellular actin rearrangements, we have searched for potential new interaction partners by mass spectrometry. We identified several candidates and correlated their localization with the subcellular dynamics of JMY. JMY is localized to dynamic vesiculo-tubular structures throughout the cytoplasm, which are decorated with actin and Arp2/3 complex. Moreover, JMY partially colocalizes and interacts with VAP-A, which is involved in vesicle-based transport processes. Finally, overexpression of JMY results in Golgi dispersal by loss from the trans-site and affects VSV-G transport. These analyses, together with biochemical experiments, indicate that JMY drives vesicular trafficking in the trans-Golgi region and at ER-membrane contact sites (MCS), distinct from other Arp2/3 activators involved in vesicle transport processes such as the related WHAMM or WASH.

Abstract: There is a strong need for low-cost silicon for solar cells and accordingly, there is an on-going debate about what are the acceptable contamination levels within the purified silicon feedstock to specify the material as solar grade silicon. Impurities in silicon can drastically modify the material properties relevant for solar cells. Transition metal impurities such as iron, copper and chromium are known to enhance the net recombination of minority carriers within the bulk material or negatively influence the emitter region and thus are detrimental for the cell efficiency. The knowledge about the level of metals and dopants, which are present in solar cell material, is of utmost interest for the use of alternative feedstock materials such as upgraded metallurgical silicon (UMG-Si) feedstock and for the improvement of actual industrial materials for solar cell production. Whereas most previous studies used artificial high contamination levels to investigate their influence on the solar cells efficiency, this work presents data using recent industrial feedstock material. For the first time, sensitive and direct chemical analyses of silicon before and after crystallisation were performed and correlated with final solar cell results.

Abstract: Gaucher disease induces some metabolic abnormalities so increased serum ferritin appears in more than 60% at diagnosis. The storage of glucosylceramide in macrophages produces an inflammatory response with iron recycling deregulation and release of cytokines. Iron homeostasis is controlled by the circulating peptide hepcidin and its production is influenced by inflammatory cytokines. Iron damages cells by excess of catalyzing reactive oxygen species, removal of the excess iron has a positive influence on the response to treatment and survival in patients with iron overload. We have analyzed some inflammatory biomarkers of macrophage activation and related to the iron profile, including hepcidin and liver iron deposits determined by MRI, in 8 type 1 GD patients with hyperferritinemia. We have explored the changes in this profile after 4months under therapy with two different iron chelators, deferoxamine or deferasirox, by evaluating response, adverse events and quality of life. We observed a significant reduction in serum ferritin and hepcidin levels and in liver iron deposits. No differences were observed in chitotriosidase activity, CCL18/PARC concentration and IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-13, MIP-1α, MIP-1β,TNF-α cytokine levels. After two years on follow-up, clinical and analytical data were improved and stable ferritin levels maintained less than 700ng/dL.

Abstract: A sustainable development of the chalcopyrite thin film technology requires the replacement of CdS buffer layer by environment friendly materials. Alternative buffers such as Zn(O,S) and In2S3 have already been successfully developed and led to efficiencies comparable to those of CdS-buffered solar cells. In this contribution, we report the results of the development of Cd-free buffers by atomic layer deposition on Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 absorbers. Zn(O,S) buffer layers were deposited on sequentially grown Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 absorbers from Bosch Solar CISTech GmbH. The influence of the absorber surface conditioning and process parameters is studied. Efficiencies and open circuit voltages exceeding 15% and 600mV, respectively, which are better than those of CdS-buffered references, are achieved with laboratory scale solar cells. Mini-module results show efficiency reaching 11.4%.

Abstract: The power conversion efficiency enhancement of InAs quantum dots solar cell is investigated by using sol–gel grown tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) single layer antireflection coatings. A sol–gel synthesis method is developed to grow Ta2O5 films with a refractive index of 1.9. A power conversion efficiency enhancement of 41% is obtained by using a single Ta2O5 layer, while the enhancement in the external quantum efficiency is nearly 60%. The substantial improvement in the device performance is attributed to the increase in the generated photocurrent without degrading the open circuit voltage. The enhancement in the device performance is due to the significant reduction in the reflection of the incident photons. Furthermore, the enhancement is found to depend on the Ta2O5 film thickness.

Abstract: Modeling of PV systems is very crucial for embedded power system applications and maximum power point tracking. This paper presents a proposed two-diode model for PV module with its seven-parameter capable of analytically describing I–V characteristic for each generic condition of operative temperature and solar irradiance. Determination of seven-parameter plays an important role in a PV module fabrication, design and an accurate prediction of PV system performance at low and high irradiance levels. Seven-parameter is estimated using the Newton Raphson method with the aid of initial values which are derived from basic equations of the model and manufacturing data sheet at standard test conditions. Newton Raphson and Runge–Kutta Merson iteration methods are proposed to verify the capability of the model to fit non-linear output characteristics of I–V and P–V. The procedures were tested on three different modules of multi-crystalline, amorphous, and thin film solar cell PV manufacturers. Results are compared with the points taken directly from the manufacturer׳s published curves and the proposed results of other authors. The results of proposed model show an excellent agreement with respect to data sheet and other works.

Phenotypic expression of a novel C282Y/R226G compound heterozygous state in HFE hemochromatosis: Molecular dynamics and biochemical studies,

Abstract: Most adults affected with hereditary hemochromatosis are homozygous for a single point mutation of HFE (p.Cys282Tyr). Apart from the compound heterozygous state for the p.Cys282Tyr mutant and the widespread p.His63Asp variant allele, other rare HFE mutations can be found in trans and may have clinical impact. In the present report we describe the structural and functional consequences of a new mutation, namely the p.Arg226Gly which was inherited in trans with the p.Cys282Tyr allele in a patient affected with a mild iron overload. Because the R226G substitution is located in the vicinity of the normal Cys225S–S282Cys disulfide bond we initially investigated the structure of the variant by molecular dynamics techniques in order to estimate the effect of the mutation on the global structure of HFE domain α3. We found that the solvation free energy, hydrophobicity and formation of salt bridges are slightly modified with the global secondary structure of the α3 domain being conserved. In a previous paper, we demonstrated that the Q283P substitution leads to the loss of the normal Cys225S–S282Cys disulfide bridge. Similar to the Q283P substitution, the R226G substitution does not substitute a residue directly involved in the formation of the disulfide bridge. However, unlike the p.Gln283Pro variant which destroyed the normal disulfide bridge, the R226G mutation does not affect the normal Cys225S–S282Cys bridge. Furthermore based on cell line studies we clearly show that the mutation does not prevent cell surface localization, β2-microglobulin association and binding to transferrin receptor 1. This new compound heterozygous phenotype is very close to those of the C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous patients who display the biochemical hemochromatosis phenotype but with lower body iron stores than C282Y homozygotes. Our results do not exclude unknown genetic and/or metabolic factors that may act synergistically to increase the ferritin level.

Complexity of the alpha-globin genotypes identified with thalassemia screening in Sardinia,

Abstract: α-Thalassemia commonly results from deletions or point mutations in one or both α-globin genes located on chromosome 16p13.3 giving rise to complex and variable genotypes and phenotypes. Rarely, unusual non-deletion defects or atypical deletions down-regulate the expression of the α-globin gene. In the last decade of the program for β-thalassemia carrier screening and genetic counseling in Sardinia, the association of new techniques of molecular biology such as gene sequencing and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to conventional methods has allowed to better define several thalassemic genotypes and the complex variability of the α-cluster with its flanking regions, with a high frequency of different genotypes and compound heterozygosity for two α mutations even in the same family. The exact molecular definition of the genotypes resulting from the interactions among the large number of α-thalassemia determinants and with β-thalassemia, is important for a correct correlation of genotype–phenotype and to prevent underdiagnosis of carrier status which could hamper the effectiveness of a screening program particularly in those regions where a high frequency of hemoglobinopathies is present.

Abstract: Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) act as downstream effectors of Rho family GTPases and drive the formation and elongation of linear actin filaments in various cellular processes. Here we analyzed the DRF dDia1 from Dictyostelium cells. The biochemical characterization of recombinant dDia1-FH1FH2 by bulk polymerization assays and single filament TIRF microscopy revealed that dDia1 is a rather weak nucleator. Addition of any of the three Dictyostelium profilin isoforms, however, markedly accelerated formin-mediated actin filament barbed end elongation in TIRF assays. Interestingly, filament elongation was significantly faster in presence of DdPFN I (profilin I) when compared to the other two isoforms, suggesting selectivity of dDia1 for DdPFN I. Additionally, we frequently observed dissociation of the formin from growing barbed ends. These findings are consistent with dilution-induced depolymerization assays in presence of dDia1-FH1FH2 showing that dDia1 is a weak capper in comparison with heterodimeric capping protein. To study the physiological role of this formin, we created cell lines lacking dDia1 or overexpressing GFP-tagged dDia1. Of note, constitutively active dDia1 accumulated homogenously in the entire pseudopod suggesting that it controls microfilament architecture to regulate cell migration. Comparison of wild type and dDia1-null cells in random cell migration and chemotaxis toward a cAMP gradient revealed no major differences. By contrast, phototaxis of dDia1-deficient cells during the multicellular stage was markedly impaired. While wild type slugs moved with high directionality toward the light source, the trails of dDia1-null slugs displayed a characteristic V-shaped profile and deviated in angles between 50° and 60° from the path of the incident light. Possibly in conjunction with this defect, dDia1-null cells also formed substantially smaller fruiting bodies. These findings demonstrate dDia1 to be critically involved in collective cell migration during terminal differentiation.

Abstract: The core complex of telomere-associated proteins, named the shelterin complex, plays a critical role in telomere protection and telomere length (TL) homeostasis. In this study, we have explored changes in the expression of telomere-associated genes POT1, TIN2, RAP1 and TPP1, in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM). A total of 154 patients: 70 with MGUS and 84 with MM were studied. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify gene expression. TL was evaluated by Terminal Restriction Fragments. Our data showed increased expression of POT1, TPP1, TIN2 and RAP1 in MM with respect to MGUS patients, with significant differences for POT1 gene (p=0.002). In MM, the correlation of gene expression profiles with clinical characteristics highlighted POT1 for its significant association with advanced clinical stages, high calcium and β2-microglobulin levels (p=0.02) and bone lesions (p=0.009). In multivariate analysis, POT1 expression (p=0.04) was a significant independent prognostic factor for overall survival as well as the staging system (ISS) (p<0.02). Our findings suggest for the first time the participation of POT1 in the transformation process from MGUS to MM, and provide evidence of this gene as a useful prognostic factor in MM as well as a possible molecular target to design new therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Background
BMI1 is a polycomb group (PcG) protein and is overexpressed in leukemia. It plays a key role in the self-renewal of stem cells. Leukemic cells lacking BMI1 underwent proliferation arrest and showed signs of differentiation and apoptosis.
Aim
This study was aimed to investigate the expression and impact of BMI1 in myeloid leukemias. Expression levels of BMI1 in 100 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 100 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients and 20 healthy controls were measured by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR).
Results
The results showed that the expression of BMI1 was significantly higher in AML and CML versus control subjects (p<0.001 for both). The 2-year overall and disease free survival rates were significantly lower in patients expressing higher BMI1. Multivariate analysis showed that BMI1 was independent prognostic factor for OS for AML cases (p=0.015, HR=3.204, 95% CI=1.250–8.212). Accelerated and blastic phases in CML cases expressed higher BMI1 than chronic phase (p<0.001).
Conclusion
We concluded that detecting BMI1 is helpful for predicting the survival in AML patients and monitoring the aggressiveness and progression in patients with CML.

Abstract: We report a novel mutation in a boy with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS) who was 4years and 10months of age and underwent successful umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT). The child presented at 3months of age with symptomatic thrombocytopenia and eczema. Despite a large dose of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment, no increase in the platelet count was observed. A genetic analysis revealed a deletion mutation at c.410_419del10 in exon 4, which resulted in the replacement of encoded phenylalanine with serine at amino acid 137 and caused an early stop codon at downstream amino acid 121 (p.F137SfsX121), and confirmed a diagnosis of WAS. The only curative treatment for WAS is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Because no matched sibling donor was available, he underwent unrelated UCBT. He is currently alive and doing well at fourteen months post-transplant, and he is free of any bleeding episodes. The eczema that was all over his body had disappeared. This case suggests that unrelated UCBT may be safe and technically feasible for the treatment of WAS when an appropriately matched related or unrelated donor is unavailable.

Abstract: Several molecular markers have been described that help to classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous hematopoietic tissue neoplasm, into risk groups. We determined the frequency of DNMT3A mutations, their associations with clinical and molecular characteristics and outcome, in primary, cytogenetically-normal AML (CN-AML) and CN-myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A total of 63 CN-AML and 16 CN-MDS patients were analyzed for mutations in DNMT3A, codon R822 by direct sequencing and mutation of NPM1 and FLT3/ITD. DNMT3A mutations were found in 17/63 (27%) of CN-AML and in 1/16 (6.3%) of CN-MDS patients. Patients with DNMT3A mutations were older (p=0.047), had higher white blood cell (WBC) counts (p=0.046), more often belonged to FAB groups M4 and M5 (p=0.017), and were more associated with NPM1 mutations (p=0.017), than those with wild-type DNMT3A. DNMT3A-mutated patients had shorter overall disease survival (p<0.001) and disease-free survival (p=0.014) when the entire patient cohort was considered, which remained significant in multivariate analysis. We conclude that DNMT3A R882 mutations are recurrent molecular aberrations in CN-AML, less frequent in CN-MDS, and that testing for R882 mutations may provide a useful tool for refining risk classification of CN-AML.

Abstract: Spectroscopic ellipsometry has been used to extract the optical indices of blend organic donor:ZnO (1:2) thin films. Four different donor molecules are investigated in this study: P3HT, PCPDTBT, PTB7 and DTS(PTTh2)2. Using these optical indices as input parameters, the optical performances and the color range for human eyes of donor:ZnO (1:2) hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells have been investigated through optical simulations. These calculations suggest that a tradeoff between reflectance for human eyes and photonic absorption of the AM1.5 spectrum can be reached depending on the composition of the active layer. While the total device reflectance in the visible range is closely correlated to the photonic absorption in the case of a high band gap semiconducting material, a tradeoff is easier to obtain in the case of low band gap semi-conducting materials. Finally, we show that the color range of devices depends both on the active layer compositions and the geometrical parameters of the cells.

Abstract: In this work Cd2SnO4 polycrystalline thin films with cubic phase were deposited on glass substrates by the sol–gel technique starting from the mixture of two simple precursor solutions of CdO and SnO2, obtained at room temperature. Both solutions were prepared using metallic salts, cadmium acetate and stannous chloride. The Sn atomic concentration percentages (X) in the precursor solution with respect to Cd (1−X) were 16, 25, 29, 33, 36 and 40. The films were sintered at 550°C in air and, after that, exposed to two different annealing treatments, 96/4N2/H2 gas mixture and vacuum, at 350°C and 550°C, respectively. X-ray diffraction patterns of the films without annealing showed three types of films: i) for X<29at%, the films were constituted of CdO+Cd2SnO4 crystals, ii) for X=29at% and X=33at%, Cd2SnO4 polycrystalline thin films were obtained, and iii) for X>33at%, Cd2SnO4+ CdSnO3 crystals were formed. Cd2SnO4 films maintained the spinel-type crystalline structure of the Cd2SnO4 after the annealing processes. On the other hand, Electron Dispersion Spectroscopy measurements revealed that Cd2SnO4 films obtained at X=29at%, without annealing, had a Cd/Sn ratio nearest to the one of the Cd2SnO4 compounds. With and without annealing Cd2SnO4 films showed high optical transmission ~85% in the 500nm<λ<1500nm range. A minimum resistivity value was around 2×10−3Ωcm, which was obtained for Cd2SnO4 films (X=33at%) annealed in vacuum at 550°C, and a direct band gap energy value of 3.55eV. As a test of the quality of these films as transparent electrodes, Au/Cu2Te/CdTe/CdS/Cd2SnO4/glass solar cells were obtained with average efficiency of 10.7%.

Abstract: We investigate the dark low-frequency noise characteristics of P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction organic solar cells in both forward and reverse bias conditions. The current noise power spectral density (SI) is “1/f”-like and is compared among cells annealed at different temperatures (60°C to 140°C). The asymmetric relationship of SI versus DC dark current (IDC) can be explained by the competition between the recombination current noise and tunneling current noise. Among the different annealing temperatures, we find that higher annealing temperature yields smaller ratio of the Hooge parameter to the carrier recombination lifetime, which is reflected in the forward bias SI versus IDC relationship. We demonstrate that the low-frequency noise can serve as a non-destructive diagnostic indicator of the performance of organic solar cells.

By tailoring surface tension and the atomization condition of the e-sprayed sol precursor, e-sprayed VOx layers on top of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces were successfully obtained, which enabled alternative architectures of conventional/inverted cells in a sub-module. The integrated PSC module that alternatively incorporated patterned metal oxide layer exhibited the high aperture power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.93% with a geometric fill factor (GFF) of 87%. Furthermore, we achieved the high aperture PCE of 4.72% on the flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate comparable to that on the glass substrate which is applicable to large area roll-to-roll PSC module production.

Abstract: Surface poisoning of gasochromic tungsten oxide layers is one of the most challenging effects, which needs to be resolved. In this paper, first amorphous TiO2/WO3/glass thin films have been prepared by reactive pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. Then they were irradiated by a single-pulse of excimer laser (λ=248nm) with different incident energies (110, 140, 170 and 200mJ) in order to obtain a thin top layer of anatase TiO2 (a-TiO2) with high photocatalytic activity. By means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), it was observed that by excimer laser treatment (ELT) at 110mJ, a-TiO2 phase is forming while a mixture of a-TiO2 and monoclinic WO3 (m-WO3) is forming at higher energies. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that laser treatment removes surface contaminants and hydroxyl groups, increases the W/Ti ratio, shifts surface tungsten oxidation states to lower binding energies and leads to the formation of TiC compound on the surface. The surface morphology of samples was investigated by atomic force microscope (AFM) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). It was revealed that the surface roughness increases with the laser energy, which is due to an increase in the height of surface granular particles. The films hydrophilicity, measured by water contact angle, was found to increase with the incident laser energy. The photocatalytic activity was investigated by methylene orange (MO) degradation test. It was observed that the sample irradiated at 110mJ has the most increased photocatalytic activity. The variation of optical transmittance was investigated by UV–vis spectrophotometer. The gasochromic properties of samples with and without laser treatment were compared in the presence of diluted hydrogen (10%H2/90%Ar) gas.

Abstract: We investigate the role of oxygen vacancies in photochromism of molybdenum oxide amorphous films. MoO3−x films with a wide range of initial stoichiometries are deposited using R.F. unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The evolution of visible light absorption in conjunction with Raman spectra for these films is studied in detail during the course of UV-irradiation to correlate the color change to the Mo6+ to Mo5+ conversion. For films which have an initially more complete stoichiometry, and hence lower oxygen vacancy concentration, the color change fully correlates with conversion of Mo6+ to Mo5+. This behavior is consistent with the group of models of photochromism of transition metal oxides which disregard the presence of oxygen vacancies in the films. However, coloration of the films with initially greater deviation from complete stoichiometry, and hence higher oxygen vacancy concentration, is not accompanied by any significant conversion of Mo6+ to Mo5+. This behavior is consistent with the group of models of photochromism of transition metal oxides which rely on the presence of oxygen vacancies. Overall, the reported results demonstrate the importance of the initial stoichiometry in the photochromism of MoO3−x amorphous films, particularly in the initial stages of UV-irradiation.

Abstract: In practical use, latent heat storage system always faces a lack of phase change materials (PCMs) that have ideal performance at desirable temperature and high efficiency to treat thermal effects from various outer heat sources. To solve this problem, some new latent heat storage composites were prepared by incorporating those well-performed PCMs in porous materials. In doing this, the layered perovskite-type compounds, (1-C10H21NH3)2ZnCl4 (C10Zn) and (1-C12H25NH3)2ZnCl4 (C12Zn), were embedded in controlled porous glass (CPG), which can acquire size-dependent thermal properties. Heat storage nature, morphology and crystalline structures of the materials were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffractions (XRD). Under confinement of the porous glass with nominal pore sizes of d=12–300nm, the porous CnZn compound gains a regulation window of around 10°C in relation to the bulk by its solid–solid phase transition. The transition temperature (Td), depression of the transition temperature (∆Ttrs), and enthalpy change of the transition (∆trsHd) of the confined compound show a linear relation to the reverse pore size. A same stable thermal cycling property is observed in the pore compound as the bulk, which is consistent with similar diffraction patterns among them. The supercooling of the pore form becomes larger than the bulk. The retention of the layered structure and complete crystallization in the pore CnZn is responsible for its reversible heat storage property.

Abstract: As part of the filtration barrier, podocytes play an important role in the development of diabetic nephropathy. Disturbances in insulin signaling accompanied by insulin resistance can lead to various intracellular events. We hypothesized that high glucose concentrations would lead to disturbances in interactions between AMPK and PTEN proteins in podocytes. Experiments were performed in primary rat podocytes cultured with normal (5.6mM) or high (30mM) glucose concentrations for 5d. Immunodetection methods were used to detect AMPK, PTEN, insulin receptor, and Akt proteins, and their phosphorylated forms. Insulin-stimulated changes in glucose uptake were used to detect insulin resistance. Isoforms of AMPK were detected by RT-PCR. AMPK and PTEN activities were modified by metformin, Compound C, siRNA for AMPK isoforms α1 and α2 and siRNA for PTEN, respectively. We found that impairment of insulin induction of glucose uptake into podocytes cultivated in the presence of high glucose concentrations for long periods of time is associated with increased PTEN levels in an AMPK-dependent manner.

Abstract: Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is a tumor suppressor gene and its truncated mutations cause a few cilia-related diseases such as Gardner's syndrome. However, little is known about the mechanism that links APC mutations and cilia disorder. APC mutations lead to the expression of N-terminal fragments, which have dominant effects in tumors owing to loss of the C-terminal region or a gain of function. The present study investigated the impact of tumor-associated N-terminal APC fragments on primary cilia assembly and the possible molecular mechanism involved. We discovered that expression of tumor-associated N-terminal APC fragments (APC-N, APC-N1, APC-N2, and APC-N3, which contain amino acids 1-1018, 1-448, 449-781, and 782-1018 respectively), resulted in primary cilia defects. We found that a β-catenin/PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β feedback signal cascade is responsible for causing N-terminal APC fragment-induced cilia defects. In this cascade, dysfunctions of both β-catenin and GSK-3β were involved in the up-regulation of HDAC6 and subsequent decreased acetylated tubulin levels, which thereby led to cilia defects. These data suggest a mechanism for linking N-terminal APC fragments and cilia loss, thus accelerating our understanding of human cilia-related diseases such as Gardner's syndrome and their cause due to APC mutations.

Abstract: Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein and serves as a transport and depot protein for numerous endogenous and exogenous compounds. Earlier we had shown that cigarette smoke induces carbonylation of human serum albumin (HSA) and alters its redox state. Here, the effect of whole-phase cigarette smoke on HSA ligand-binding properties was evaluated by equilibrium dialysis and size-exclusion HPLC or tryptophan fluorescence. The binding of salicylic acid and naproxen to cigarette smoke-oxidized HSA resulted to be impaired, unlike that of curcumin and genistein, chosen as representative ligands. Binding of the hydrophobic fluorescent probe 4,4′-bis(1-anilino-8-naphtalenesulfonic acid) (bis-ANS), intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and susceptibility to enzymatic proteolysis revealed slight changes in albumin conformation. These findings suggest that cigarette smoke-induced modifications of HSA may affect the binding, transport and bioavailability of specific ligands in smokers.

Abstract: Actin filament assembly and reorganisation during cell migration and invasion into extracellular matrices is a well-documented phenomenon. Among actin-binding proteins regulating its polymerisation, the members of the WASP (Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein) family are generally thought to play the most significant role in supporting cell invasiveness. In situ, cytosolic N-WASP (neural WASP) is associated with a partner protein termed WIP (WASP Interacting Protein) that is bound to the N-terminal domain of N-WASP. Despite much effort, rather little is known about the role of WIP in regulating N-WASP and consequent actin-filament assembly. Even less is known about the function of WIP within the specialised cell adhesion and attachment structures known as podosomes and invadopodia. In particular, whilst the interaction of WIP with known participants in the development and maturation of invadopodia such as N-WASP, the Arp2/3 complex and cortactin has been described, little is known concerning the direct contribution of WIP to invadopodia and its potential role as a regulator of cancer cell invasion. In this report, we use 2D and 3D culture systems to describe the role played by WIP in modulating the morphology and invasiveness of metastatic breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as its effect on the process of mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) seen in these cells. We demonstrate that WIP is necessary for invadopodium formation and matrix degradation by basal breast cancer cells, but not sufficient to induce invasiveness in luminal cells.

Long non-coding RNA and microRNAs might act in regulating the expression of BARD1 mRNAs,

Abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are ubiquitously expressed RNA molecules of more than 200 nucleotides without substantial ORFs. LncRNAs could act as epigenetic regulators of gene expression affecting transcription, mRNA stability and transport, and translation, although, precise functions have been attributed to only few of them. Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) represent one recently emerged type of functional lncRNAs that share microRNA recognition sequences with mRNAs and may compete for microRNA binding and thus affect regulation and function of target mRNAs. We studied the epigenetic regulation of the BARD1 gene. The BARD1 protein acts as tumor suppressor with BRCA1. In cancer, mRNAs encoding the tumor suppressor full length BARD1 are often down-regulated while the expression of oncogenic truncated isoforms is boosted. We found that the BARD1 3′UTR is almost 3000nt long and harbors a large number of microRNA binding elements. In addition we discovered a novel lncRNA, BARD1 9′L, which is transcribed from an alternative promoter in intron 9 of the BARD1 gene and shares part of the 3′UTR with the protein coding BARD1 mRNAs. We demonstrate with the example of two microRNAs, miR-203 and miR-101, that they down-regulate the expression of FL BARD1 and cancer-associated BARD1 mRNAs, and that BARD1 9′L counteracts the effect of miR-203 and miR-101, As BARD1 9′L is abnormally over-expressed in human cancers, we suggest it might be a tumor promoting factor and treatment target.

Abstract: Thalassemia and sickle cell disease are the most prevalent hemoglobin disorders in the populations of Dammam, Al-Qatif and Al-Ahsa regions in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia where our study cases originated. Increased HbF can modify these disorders. Direct sequencing of the HBA2 and HBA1 genes from 157 Saudi subjects revealed a new HBA2 gene conversion in cis or trans in 5.7% of the total. We refer to this new HBA2 gene convert as an α12 (HBA12) allele due to its combination of α1 (HBA1) and α2 (HBA2) sequences. Three genotypes, homozygous (-α123.7/α1α12), heterozygous (α1α2/α1α12) and hemizygous (α1- 4.2/α1α12) for the α12 allele were observed. The majority of individuals who were positive for the α12 allele had a reduction in the percentage of HbA2. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the possible effect of these changes on globin gene expression.

Abstract: Blood transfusion and iron chelation currently represent a supportive therapy to manage anemia, vasculopathy and vaso-occlusion crises in Sickle-Cell-Disease. Here we describe the first 5-year long-term randomized clinical trial comparing Deferiprone versus Deferoxamine in patients with Sickle-Cell-Disease. The results of this study show that Deferiprone has the same effectiveness as Deferoxamine in decreasing body iron burden, measured as repeated measurements of serum ferritin concentrations on the same patient over 5-years and analyzed according to the linear mixed-effects model (LMM) (p=0.822). Both chelators are able to decrease, significantly, serum ferritin concentrations, during 5-years, without any effect on safety (p=0.005). Moreover, although the basal serum ferritin levels were higher in transfused compared with non-transfused group (p=0.031), the changes over time in serum ferritin levels were not statistically significantly different between transfused and non-transfused cohort of patients (p=0.389). Kaplan–Meier curve, during 5-years of study, suggests that Deferiprone does not alter survival in comparison with Deferoxamine (p=0.38). In conclusion, long-term iron chelation therapy with Deferiprone was associated with efficacy and safety similar to that of Deferoxamine. Therefore, in patients with Sickle-Cell-Disease, Deferiprone may represent an effective long-term treatment option.

Abstract: This study examines the frequency and spectrum of α- and β-thalassemia (thal) mutations of the Li people in Hainan Province of China. We have analyzed by genotyping a sample of 8600 subjects of the Li people and found that 53.45% subjects have only α-thal mutations with high frequencies of −α4.2 and −α3.7, but fewer −−SEA mutation; 3.83% have β-thal mutations all identified to be 41/42 (−TCTT); whereas 7.99% carry both α-thal and β-thal mutations. We also examined 9800 subjects of the Han people, and the result showed 12.16% subjects have only α-thal mutations with −−SEA and −α3.7 the most frequent mutation types, 6.11% have only β-thal mutations of 7 types, whereas 4.85% carry both α-thal and β-thal mutations. Our study demonstrated that the Li people in Hainan province have a high incidence of −α4.2 and −α3.7 thalassemia, low frequencies of α-thal −SEA, and a novel β mutation, 41/42 (−TCTT). We provide the complete spectrum of α-thal and β-thal mutations and a strategy for accurate molecular diagnostic testing in the Li people in Hainan Province of Southern China.

Abstract: Engineered metallic nanostructures, namely, plasmonic nanostructures, have broad application prospects. Herein, we develop a versatile and reliable method, which combines slope self-assembly colloidal crystal with metal deposition, to harvest the engineered metallic nanostructures. The method possesses the advantages of low-cost, high sample output and being compatible with industrial process. Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are integrated within pre-designed engineered metallic nanostructures. Impressed results (an approximate 15 fold increase of photoluminescence intensity), have been realized. Moreover, field distribution of the periodic metal nanostructures is simulated via finite-difference time domain (FDTD). Importantly, a new mechanism, in addition to conventional theory, is proposed to illustrate the large enhancement of fluorescence efficiency. Additionally, engineered fluorescence, including controlled emission linewidth, peak and intensity, is achieved through the coupling of engineered metallic nanostructures and QDs. It is demonstrated that plasmonic nanostructures and engineered fluorescence has the potential to provide promise for a range of applications, including solar cell, light-emitting diodes, and single-molecule studies.

Abstract: Optical and structural properties of submonolayer InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot solar cells (SML-QDSCs) are investigated and compared with quantum well solar cells (QWSCs). Compared with InGaAs/GaAs QWSCs with a similar structure, the material quality for SML QDSCs is significantly improved with a reduced density of both crosshatch patterns and defects. This coincides with a much higher photoluminescence intensity obtained for SML QDSCs. SML QDSCs thus exhibit an increase in open circuit voltage of 70meV and an improvement in short circuit current from 15.9mA/cm2 to 17.7mA/cm2 in comparison with QWSCs. These findings present a promising alternative to quantum wells in photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: In this work, two process simplifications for n-type PERT (passivated emitter rear totally diffused) bifacial solar cells are investigated. Both are based on a single thermal treatment for elaborating boron and phosphorus doped regions aiming at reducing the number of high temperature steps of standard process. The first simplification shows a mixed co-diffusion from a gaseous source of phosphorus and a boron doped dielectric layer elaborated by low frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The second exhibits two independent ion implantations, followed by a co-anneal/activation step. In both cases, implied open-circuit voltages are similar to standard process (~660–670mV) and emitters allow good contacting by screen-printing (ρc=3.0–5.0mΩcm2). PERT cells resulting from these processes show very promising performances with efficiency up to 19.7% on industrial 156×156mm2 pseudo square Cz wafers.

Abstract: The efficiency of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells depends crucially on charge transport in the composite. The charge carrier mobilities in common polymer:fullerene blends are rather low and depend strongly on the film morphology. Here we show the improvement of performance of canonical polymer:fullerene solar cells by embedding highly dispersed Mo6S9−xIx nanowires within their active layer. Adding 0.5wt% of nanowires raises both the fill factor and the open-circuit voltage, resulting in 18% higher power conversion efficiency. We attribute this increase to improved charge transport by the embedded nanowire mesh and envisage further improvement by using higher nanowire weight fractions and thinner nanowire bundles.

Abstract: Upconversion is a promising technique for harvesting sub-band-gap photons in photovoltaic devices. In this work, the optimum erbium (Er3+) doping within the efficient upconverting host material hexagonal sodium yttrium fluoride (β-NaYF4) is investigated for a wide range of irradiance values and under broadband excitation (80±1nm). Measurements of the internal photoluminescent quantum yield (iPLQY) have been conducted over two orders of magnitude in irradiance, the corresponding solar concentrations characterised, and the external photoluminescent quantum yield (ePLQY) determined. The iPLQY measurements required calibration due to overlap of absorption and re-emission in the range of 1450–1600nm. The highest iPLQY was for 20% Er3+ with a value of 10.7±1.2% and a normalised efficiency of (5.43±0.90)×10−4cm2W−1 at an irradiance of 1.97±0.24MWm−2 ((108±13)×103Suns). More importantly for application to silicon solar cells, the highest ePLQY was for 25% Er3+ and was measured to be 6.6±0.7% ((3.35±0.56)×10−4cm2W−1), which agrees well with monochromatic investigations. The 25% Er3+ sample was shown to be more efficient due to an anomalous increase and broadening of the absorption in comparison to lower concentrations. Furthermore, energy transfer mechanisms are proposed for the reduced efficiency of higher concentrations and depletion of the upconversion luminescence.

Abstract: A community-based survey was conducted to determine the prevalence and gene frequency of Hemoglobin Constant Spring (Hb CS) and other forms of thalassemia among an ethnic minority in Vietnam. A total of 298 ethnic minority women, the Có-Tu, participated. Hematological parameters and hemoglobin profiles were analyzed using standard automated analyzers. Alpha- and beta-thalassemia mutations were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based technology. Of the 298 women, 141 (47.3%) carried thalassemia genes. Hemoglobin Constant Spring (Hb CS) is the most common with a markedly high frequency of 0.143 (overall prevalence=26.2%). The heterozygous state of Hb CS was found in one-fifth (20.5%) of women participating. Seven women (2.4%) were Hb CS homozygote. The overall prevalence for Hb E was 13.8%, and 10.7% for α+-thalassemia. Other forms of thalassemia included 0.67% β-thalassemia, and 0.34% Hb Paksé. None of the participants had the α0-thalassemia gene. The study provides basic epidemiological information about Hb CS as well as other forms of thalassemia for a specific group of an ethnic minority in Vietnam. The data will be useful for further study on the distribution of thalassemia in Southeast Asia.

Abstract: We report the processing conditions for inkjet-printed active layers of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices comprising bulk-heterojunction blends of the low bandgap conjugated polymer poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4,7-bis(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-5,5′-diyl] (Si-PCPDTBT) as well as poly[N-9′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) used as electron donors with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) as electron acceptor. By controlling the inkjet printing processing conditions, we gain a significant improvement in device power conversion efficiency (PCE) to previously reported work using these materials. We obtain Si-PCPDTBT:fullerene and PCDTBT:fullerene-based inkjet-printed OPVs with power conversion efficiency of ~3% and ~4%, respectively.

Abstract: Delayed engraftment and graft failure represent major obstacles to successful umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation. Herein, we evaluated the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy as an intervention to improve human UCB stem/progenitor cell engraftment in an immune deficient mouse model. Six- to eight-week old NSG mice were sublethally irradiated 24hours prior to CD34+ UCB cell transplant. Irradiated mice were separated into a non-HBO group (where mice remained under normoxic conditions) and the HBO group (where mice received 2 hours of HBO therapy; 100% oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute). Four hours after completing HBO therapy, both groups intravenously received CD34+ UCB cells that were transduced with a lentivirus carrying luciferase gene and expanded for in vivo imaging. Mice were imaged and then sacrificed at one of 10 times up to 4.5months post-transplant. HBO treated mice demonstrated significantly improved bone marrow, peripheral blood, and spleen retention and subsequent engraftment. In addition, HBO significantly improved peripheral, spleen and bone marrow engraftment of human myeloid and B-cell subsets. In vivo imaging demonstrated that HBO mice had significantly higher ventral and dorsal bioluminescence values. These studies suggest that HBO treatment of NSG mice prior to UCB CD34+ cell infusion significantly improves engraftment.

Abstract: TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) plays a critical role in the regulation of innate immune responses and adaptive immune responses. Though recent studies indicate that TRAF6 is involved in cancer, its precise role in cancer including colon cancer has not been extensively investigated and remains largely unknown. The purpose of this work is to determine the expression of TRAF6 in colon cancer as well as the possible role of it in proliferation and apoptosis of colon cancer cells. Fifty colon cancer tissues paired with their adjacent non-cancerous tissues were analyzed. TRAF6 expression is upregulated in cancers (P=0.000), which is correlated with tumor grades (P=0.012). The tumor tissue-array analysis also indicates that expression of TRAF6 is upregulated in colon cancer (P=0.000), but the TRAF6 upregulation has no association with patients’ survival rate (P=0.055). We found that knockdown of TRAF6 blocks proliferation of colon cancer cells through cyclin D1. Different from other reports, in our experiments knockdown of TRAF6 alone has little effect on survival of colon cancer cells examined. Knockdown of TRAF6 sensitizes the cells to treatment of the conventional anti-cancer drugs 5-fluorouracil and etoposide. Thus, inhibition of TRAF6 may improve the therapeutic treatment of these drugs. Together, our data suggest that TRAF6 promotes proliferation of colon cancer cells and it may serve as a potential target for therapy of colon cancer.

Abstract: HFE-hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal disease characterized by excessive iron absorption. Homozygotes for H63D variant, and still less H63D heterozygotes, generally do not express HH phenotype. The data collected in our previous study in the province of Matera (Basilicata, Italy) underlined that some H63D carriers showed altered iron metabolism, without additional factors. In this study, we selected a cohort of 10/22 H63D carriers with severe biochemical iron overload (BIO). Additional analysis was performed for studying HFE exons, exon–intron boundaries, and untranslated regions (UTRs) by performing DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing. The results showed a novel substitution (NM_000410.3:c.847C>T) in a patient exon 4 (GenBankJQ478433); it introduces a premature stop-codon (PTC). RNA extraction and reverse-transcription were also performed. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out for verifying if our aberrant mRNA is targeted for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD); we observed that patient HFE mRNA was expressed much less than calibrator, suggesting that the mutated HFE protein cannot play its role in iron metabolism regulation, resulting in proband BIO. Our finding is the first evidence of a variation responsible for a PTC in iron cycle genes. The genotype–phenotype correlation observed in our cases could be related to the additional mutation.

Abstract: To investigate the molecular mechanisms of cancer metastasis, we have isolated a high-metastatic bladder cancer cell subpopulation from a low-metastatic cell line by using an in vivo selection system. Cells in the subpopulation showed a high ability to form invadopodia, the filamentous actin (F-actin)-based membrane protrusions that play an essential role in cancer cell invasion. Analysis of the gene expression profile revealed that the expression of an intermediate filament (IF) protein, vimentin and a cytoskeletal linker protein, plectin was up-regulated in the high-metastatic subpopulation compared with the low metastatic cell line. Here we report a novel role of vimentin IF and plectin in metastasis. In invasive bladder cancer cells, the vimentin IF-plectin-invadopodia F-actin link was formed. Disruption of this link severely impaired invadopodia formation, reducing the capacities of extracellular matrix degradation, transendothelial migration and metastasis. In addition, the vimentin assembly into the filaments was required for invadopodia formation. Our results suggest that plectin anchoring invadopodia to vimentin IF scaffolds and stabilizes invadopodia, which is a critical molecular process for cancer cell invasion and extravasation for metastasis.

Abstract: Circadian rhythms are highly conserved time tracking systems regulating important biological processes at both systemic and cellular levels. The present study was aimed to identify proteins and biological functions circadian regulated in human keratinocytes. HaCaT keratinocytes were entrained by temperature cycles, and a proteomic study was performed on cell fractions isolated under free running conditions at constant temperature. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that molecular clock entrainment was associated with changes in molecular components regulating cell proliferation, energy metabolism, transcription, translation and redox balance. Nuclear levels of the antioxidant enzyme Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) were found to oscillate rhythmically over two entire 24h long cycles. Donwregulation of PRDX2 resulted in upregulation of the mitochondrion-specific Peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3), all other members of the Peroxiredoxin family remained unaltered. Furthermore, PRDX2 knockdown increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired cell cycle progression and proliferation. HaCaT cells transduced with a scramble shRNA were used as control. Our work is the first to show that nuclear levels of PRDX2 display circadian oscillation participating in the regulation of human keratinocytes redox balance.

Abstract: Background
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disease characterized by the presence of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) leading to expression of a BCR–ABL1 fusion oncogene. The BCR–ABL protein has a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity which is responsible for CML pathogenesis by promoting cell apoptosis resistance; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with BCR–ABL expression and apoptosis impairment in CML leukemic cells have not been fully elucidated.
Methods
This study evaluated apoptomiRs and their predicted apoptotic genes in BCR–ABL+ cells from patients in different phases of CML treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) according to their imatinib (IM) response by qPCR. Phosphotyrosine and c-ABL expressions in HL-60.BCR–ABL cells treated with TKI were done by Western blot.
Results
We found that dasatinib (DAS) modulated miR-let-7d, miR-let-7e, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-21, miR-130a and miR-142-3p expressions while IM modulated miR-15a and miR-130a levels. miR-16, miR-130a and miR-145 expressions were modulated by nilotinib (NIL). We observed higher miR-15a, miR-130b and miR-145; and lower miR-16, miR-26a and miR-146a expressions in CML-CP in comparison with controls. CML-AP patients showed low miR-let-7d, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-29c, miR-142-3p, miR-145, and miR-146a levels in comparison with CML-CP. We noted that the miR-26a, miR-29c, miR-130b and miR-146a expressions were downregulated in IM resistant patients in comparison with IM responsive patients.
Conclusions
This study showed the modulation of apoptomiRs by BCR–ABL kinase activity and the deregulation of apoptomiRs and their predicted apoptotic target genes in different CML phases and after treatment with TK inhibitors. ApoptomiRs may be involved in the BCR–ABL+ cell apoptosis regulation.

Abstract: Degradation from mechanical loading of transparent electrodes made of indium tin oxide (ITO) endangers the integrity of any material based on these electrodes, including flexible organic solar cells. However, how different schemes of degradation change the conductivity of ITO devices remains unclear. We propose a systematic micro-mechanics-based approach to clarify the relationship between degradation and changes in electrical resistance. By comparing experimentally measured channel crack densities to changes in electrical resistance returned by the different micro-mechanical schemes, we highlight the key role played by the residual conductivity in the interface between the ITO electrode and its substrate after delamination. We demonstrate that channel cracking alone does not explain the experimental observations. Our results indicate that delamination has to take place between the ITO electrode and the substrate layers and that the residual conductivity of this delaminated interface plays a major role in changes in electrical resistance of the degraded device.

Abstract: Arrays of 100nm long n-cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanowires were investigated as replacement for the planar n-CdS film, which is presently used as a window layer in many solar cell devices. These arrays exhibited substantial transmission at wavelengths below 512nm. Theoretical calculation involving the number of extra photons transmitted through the CdS nanowire window layer indicated a potential enhancement in photocurrent by 20.6% and in open circuit voltage by 10.2% over the device using planar CdS film as the window layer. Next, Au/CdS Schottky diodes were formed. Analysis of the current–voltage characteristics of these Schottky diodes showed smaller diode ideality factors and higher current density in devices with CdS nanowires than in devices with planar CdS film. Capacitance–voltage measurements yielded values of effective carrier concentration (N(x)) in the CdS nanowire. N(x) varied along the length of nanowire; it was higher near the top surface and lower, near the SnO2 base. In initial experiments, p-CdTe layer was deposited on top and a nanowire-CdS/CdTe photovoltaic device of 0.04cm2 area exhibited short current density (Jsc) of 25.8mA/cm2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 722mV and fill factor of 52.8%, resulting in an a power conversion efficiency value of 9.8%.

Abstract: We conducted a chronoamperometric study to observe the electrochemical behaviors of the nucleation mechanism of electrodeposited Cu(In,Al)Se2 films. A change from instantaneous nucleation to progressive nucleation was observed by increasing the copper concentration. SEM and EDS analyses demonstrated that the surface morphologies and chemical compositions of precursor and post-annealed Cu(In,Al)Se2 films were influenced by the nucleation mechanism. They exhibited that Cu(In,Al)Se2 films had roughly cauliflower-like and triangular structures with Cu-poor composition at the instantaneous nucleation mechanism, whereas smooth and round structures with Cu-rich composition at the progressive nucleation mechanism. Additionally, the quality, growth orientation, composition phase, and optical energy band gap of Cu(In,Al)Se2 films were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Raman spectra, and (αhν)2 vs. hν plots (UV–vis). Thereafter, the performances of rudimentary Cu(In,Al)Se2 solar cells fabricated at various copper concentrations were discussed, the conversion efficiency of electrodeposited Cu(In,Al)Se2 solar cells were unpublished in previous literatures. Our studies demonstrated that the performances of Cu(In,Al)Se2 solar cells were significantly related to the surface morphology and composition of Cu(In,Al)Se2 absorber layer. The highest conversion efficiency of Cu(In,Al)Se2 solar cells fabricated at a 2-mM copper concentration was 1.96% with open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, Rsh and Rs values of 0.189V, 29.21mA/cm2, 35.4%, 125Ω and 2.82Ω, respectively.

Abstract: As the essential building blocks of many electronic devices, solid state thin-films are attracting extensive interest. Soluble nanocrystals (NCs) make it possible to develop robust, low-cost, large-scale fabrication methods for thin-films. However, the organic surface ligands normally used to stabilize the NCs make those thin-films a NC–ligand complex which may possess varied electrical performance compared to a single component system. Previous models could only estimate the charge transportation characteristics in those films quantitatively by considering the capping ligands as a barrier of charges from inter-particle hopping. In this work, we demonstrated that starting from first principles density functional theory, the carrier mobility in a CZTS NC–ligand complex can be determined quantitatively, and guided by this model, we developed a low-cost, low-temperature technique to fabricate CZTS thin films which have a carrier mobility of up to 10.9cm2/(VS).

Abstract: Solution processing of the electrodes is a big challenge towards scaling up and R2R processing of organic solar cells. Inkjet printing is a non-contact printing method, it can be realized by solution processing at ambient condition and provides freedom of shape in the electrode pattern. The inkjet and screen printing of the back electrode in organic solar cells with inverted architecture is investigated. To this purpose, different types of PEDOT:PSS hole transport layers were combined with ambient processed inkjet printed or evaporated Ag electrodes. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer is the main factor determining the performance of the devices. A too thin layer of EL-P5015 PEDOT:PSS allows penetration of the solvents from the Ag ink, which leads to degradation of the devices and a drop in performance. To overcome this effect, a 1200nm thick layer of EL-P5015 is required. Alternatively, an aqueous based coating formulation of PEDOT:PSS (S305), can be combined with either inkjet printed or screen printed electrode at significantly reduced thickness down to 40nm. At the same time, the performance of these devices was comparable to devices with an evaporated electrode. Reducing the thickness of PEDOT:PSS layer from 1200nm to 40nm is a very efficient way to reduce the manufacturing costs of OPV devices. In addition, combining of thin PEDOT:PSS layer with an inkjet printed Ag grid structure allows manufacturing of semi-transparent devices.

Abstract: In the study, we inserted different types of intrinsic and p-type layers as the p/i buffer layer in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar cells and investigated their effects on device performance. The band gap and activation energy of the buffer layer had a significant effect on the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the cells. Inserting a hydrogenated intrinsic amorphous silicon oxide (i-a-SiOx:H) layer as the p/i buffer layer in a-Si:H solar cells leads to a significant Voc increase up to 909mV. It also increased the external quantum efficiency at 400nm to 75%. This was primarily owing to the increase in the built-in electric field and a decrease in the rate of carrier recombination at the p/i interface. Finally, the initial conversion efficiencies of single-junction a-Si:H solar cell and hydrogenated amorphous silicon/hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon (a-Si:H/μc-Si:H) tandem solar cell could be increased to 10.64% and 12.24%, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper we present our latest progress in fabricating high quality crystalline silicon thin film solar cells on glass. Large silicon grains are directly formed via electron-beam induced liquid phase crystallization (LPC) from a nanocrystalline precursor film. The LPC process is carried out on an amorphous SiO2 layer, and both a high quality self-passivating interface and excellent electronic bulk properties are obtained. Solar cells with stable efficiencies of 11.5% and open-circuit voltages well above 600mV with a maximum value of 656mV are presented. So far, such high VOC values have only been achieved on wafer-based silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Purpose
Mammography is the cornerstone of breast cancer (BC) evaluation. This report investigates whether breast density (BD) and mammographic features of the tumor can provide information on both BC susceptibility to chemotherapy and other clinicopathologic features of locally advanced BC (LA BC).
Materials and methods
We evaluated mammography films and clinicopathological information of patients with LA BC who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by tumor resection at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas (INEN) from 2000 to 2011.
Results
We selected 494 LA BC cases. Most cases were at clinical tumor stage 4 (48.5%), node stage 1 (58.8%) and had high histologic grade (53.3%). BI-RADS 1, 2, 3, and 4 BD were found in 16.9%, 22%, 35.7% and 25.1% of patients, respectively. High BD has been associated with younger age (p<0.001), obesity (p=0.017) and no skin infiltration (T3 vs T4) (p=0.018). An association between dusty microcalcifications and HER2 group, as well as between casting microcalcifications and TN BC group (p=0.05) was found. NAC included anthracyclines and taxanes in 422 (85.5%) cases. Miller–Payne pathologic responses 4 and 5 (pCR) in the primary lesion and absence of axillary lymph nodes involvement were found in 15.3% of cases and were associated with younger age (p<0.001) and HG-3 lesions (p<0.001), but not with mammographic images.
Conclusion
Mammographic features are associated with specific clinicopathological features of pre-NAC BC lesions but do not predict pCR. The implications and biological reasons for these findings require further study.

Abstract: Here the radiative properties of the ionic liquid [HMIM][NTf2] and its nanofluids are investigated for the first time by the experimental and theoretical methods. [HMIM][NTf2] is almost transparent in the visible light range, while its optical absorption property can be significantly enhanced by dispersing a very low volume fraction of nanoparticles in it. At the volume fraction of 10ppm, the extinction coefficient of the nanofluid containing the Ni nanoparticles with an average size of 40nm is higher than that of the one containing the Cu nanoparticles with the similar average size, owing to their different complex refractive indexes. The nanofluid containing the carbon-coated Ni (Ni/C) nanoparticles exhibits lower transmittance and higher extinction coefficient, compared with the one containing the Ni nanoparticles with the similar average size. The radiative properties of the Ni/C nanofluids increase with the volume fraction of the nanoparticles. As the volume fraction is increased to 40ppm, the absorbed energy fraction by the Ni/C nanofluid reaches up to almost 100% after the incident light only penetrate 1cm. The excellent radiative properties of the IL-based nanofluids make them show promising to be used as the absorbers for medium-to-high-temperature direct absorption solar collectors.

Abstract: α-Thalassemia is a common single-gene genetic disease that can cause Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis and Hb H disease in tropical and subtropical regions. When examining conventional thalassemia genes, an only detected --SEA genotype sample needs further analysis. In doing so, we found a novel 21.9kb deletion (Qinzhou type deletion). The deletion position of the novel 21.9kb deletion is from 14373bp to 36299bp of the α-globin gene cluster (NG_000006.1); thus, there exists a 21927bp sequence deletion, into which a 29bp sequence is added. After sequence analysis, a group of Gap-PCR primers were synthesized to diagnose this novel thalassemia genotype. Through pedigree analysis, we deduced that the propositus obtained the novel alleles from her mother. The genotype of this propositus is --SEA/-α21.9 and its phenotype conforms to the characteristics of Hb H disease, establishing that the combination between -α21.9 genotype and α0 genotype can lead to Hb H disease. By molecular analysis, we established that this case fits the characteristic of an α+ thalassemia genotype.

The RNA in reticulocytes is not just debris: It is necessary for the final stages of erythrocyte formation,

Abstract: Reticulocytes contain both RNA and micro-organelles and represent the last stage of erythropoiesis before full maturation to red blood cells (RBCs). Even though there is continuing synthesis of hemoglobin and membrane-bound proteins in reticulocytes, the small amount of RNA that they contain has been regarded as non-functional residual material. Here we show that this residual RNA is both functional and essential for further reticulocyte maturation. Reticulocytes from which the remnant RNA had been removed by exposure to RNase did not survive or mature into RBCs in either humans or mice. Conversely, reticulocytes treated with an RNase Inhibitor were able to form normal biconcave cells. Similarly, poor survival was also seen in reticulocytes in which protein synthesis had been blocked. To identify the signaling pathways involved we isolated RNAs in reticulocytes versus those present in fully matured erythroblasts cultured from hematopoietic stem cells. RNAs found in erythroblasts were related to exocytosis, metabolism, and signal transduction all of which are critical for maturation through reticulocyte and into a fully mature, biconcave erythrocyte. Our results suggest that the mRNA in reticulocytes has to be translated into novel proteins that act to preserve mitochondria and maintain cell membrane integrity as reticulocytes mature. These results enhance our understanding of the final stage of erythropoiesis and may clarify why in vitro-generated reticulocytes for transfusion purposes survive poorly.
