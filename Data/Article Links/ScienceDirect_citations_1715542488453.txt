Abstract: Aims
Mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) shuttle select MSC contents and are endowed with an ability to repair ischemic tissues. We hypothesized that exposure to cardiovascular risk factors may alter the microRNA cargo of MSC-derived EVs, blunting their capacity to repair the post-stenotic kidney in pigs with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and renal artery stenosis (RAS).
Methods
Porcine MSCs were harvested from abdominal fat after 16wks of Lean- or MetS-diet, and their EVs isolated and characterized using microRNA-sequencing. Lean- and MetS-EV protective effects were assessed in-vitro in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). To compare their in-vivo efficacy to repair ischemic tissues, allogeneic-EVs were intrarenally delivered in pigs after 6wks of MetS + RAS, and 4wks later, single-kidney renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were studied in-vivo, and microvascular architecture and injury ex-vivo. Lean-, MetS-, and MetS + RAS-sham served as controls (n = 6 each).
Results
Ten microRNAs, capable of targeting several pro-angiogenic genes, were upregulated in MetS-EVs versus Lean-EVs. In vitro, MetS-EVs failed to increase tube number and length, and to boost HUVEC migration compared to Lean-EVs. Lean- and MetS-EVs were detected in the stenotic-kidney 4wks after injection in the vicinity of small vessels. RBF and GFR were lower in MetS + RAS versus MetS, and restored in MetS + RAS + Lean-EVs, but not in MetS + RAS + MetS-EVs. Furthermore, MetS-EVs failed to restore renal expression of angiogenic factors, improve microvascular density, or attenuate fibrosis.
Conclusions
MetS alters the microRNA cargo of MSC-derived EVs and impairs their functional potency, limiting the therapeutic efficacy of this endogenous cellular repair system.

Abstract: For alternative sources of β cells, patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could be promising, as cells derived from the “self” allow autologous transplantation. However, only a few studies have investigated insulin-producing cells (IPCs) using iPSCs of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). In this study, we generated IPCs using iPSCs derived from patients with T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and compared them with IPCs from a non-diabetic (ND) individual. To facilitate differentiation of human iPSCs into IPCs, we induced PDX-1 gene expression using Ad-PDX-1/VP16. IPCs derived from T1D- and T2D-specific iPSCs expressed islet-specific markers such as Pdx-1, MafA, Beta2/NeuroD, and insulin, similar to IPCs derived from ND-specific iPSCs. In addition, IPCs derived from T1D- and T2D-specific iPSCs showed comparable glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as IPCs derived from ND-specific iPSCs. These results suggest the potential for autologous transplantation using patient-specific iPSCs in patients with T1D and T2D. This study was clinically significant because the majority of people with diabetes have T2D and insulin secretion declines over time in T2D. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to generate and simultaneously compare IPCs from ND-, T1D-, and T2D-specific iPSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for pre-eclampsia is limited by the lack of accurate methods for identification of at-risk pregnancies. We performed small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of maternal serum extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) to discover and verify microRNAs (miRNAs) differentially expressed in patients who later developed pre-eclampsia. Sera collected from 73 pre-eclampsia cases and 139 controls between 17 and 28 weeks gestational age (GA), divided into separate discovery and verification cohorts, are analyzed by small RNA-seq. Discovery and verification of univariate and bivariate miRNA biomarkers reveal that bivariate biomarkers verify at a markedly higher rate than univariate biomarkers. The majority of verified biomarkers contain miR-155-5p, which has been reported to mediate the pre-eclampsia-associated repression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Deconvolution analysis reveals that several verified miRNA biomarkers come from the placenta and are likely carried by placenta-specific extracellular vesicles.

Abstract: Adult kidney stem cells are known to have important roles in renal regeneration after acute kidney injury. Although trophic factors from tissue stem cells have been reported to promote the regeneration of other organs, there is limited number of evidence of this phenomenon in the kidneys. Here, we explored the effects of secreted factors from kidney stem cells. We intraperitoneally administered culture supernatant obtained from adult rat kidney stem/progenitor cells into rat kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury models, and the treatment significantly ameliorated renal tubulointerstitial injury, suppressed tubular cell apoptosis, diminished inflammation and promoted the proliferation of both residual renal cells and immature cells. In vitro, treatment with culture supernatant from kidney stem cells significantly promoted cell proliferation and suppressed cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis in both normal rat kidney cells and kidney stem cells. In addition, treatment with culture supernatant increased the expression of nestin in normal rat kidney cells, suggesting the dedifferentiation of tubular cells into stem-like cells. Analysis of the culture supernatant revealed that it contained a variety of growth factors. Taken together, the results suggest that these factors together lead to renal regeneration. In conclusion, adult kidney stem cells contribute to renal regeneration indirectly through the secretion of regenerative factors.

Abstract: Summary
UTX, a H3K27me3 demethylase, plays an important role in mouse brain development. However, so little is known about the function of UTX in human neural differentiation and dendritic morphology. In this study, we generated UTX-null human embryonic stem cells using CRISPR/Cas9, and differentiated them into neural progenitor cells and neurons to investigate the effects of UTX loss of function on human neural development. The results showed that the number of differentiated neurons significantly reduced after loss of UTX, and that the dendritic morphology of UTX KO neurons tended to be simplified. The electrophysiological recordings showed that most of the UTX KO neurons were immature. Finally, RNA sequencing identified dozens of differentially expressed genes involved in neural differentiation and synaptic function in UTX KO neurons and our results demonstrated that UTX regulated these critical genes by resolving bivalent promoters. In summary, we establish a reference for the important role of UTX in human neural differentiation and dendritic morphology.

Abstract: Summary
Over the past decade, wingless-activated (WNT) medulloblastoma has been identified as a candidate for therapy de-escalation based on excellent survival; however, a paucity of relapses has precluded additional analyses of markers of relapse. To address this gap in knowledge, an international cohort of 93 molecularly confirmed WNT MB was assembled, where 5-year progression-free survival is 0.84 (95%, 0.763–0.925) with 15 relapsed individuals identified. Maintenance chemotherapy is identified as a strong predictor of relapse, with individuals receiving high doses of cyclophosphamide or ifosphamide having only one very late molecularly confirmed relapse (p = 0.032). The anatomical location of recurrence is metastatic in 12 of 15 relapses, with 8 of 12 metastatic relapses in the lateral ventricles. Maintenance chemotherapy, specifically cumulative cyclophosphamide doses, is a significant predictor of relapse across WNT MB. Future efforts to de-escalate therapy need to carefully consider not only the radiation dose but also the chemotherapy regimen and the propensity for metastatic relapses.

Abstract: Summary
While metabolic changes are considered a cancer hallmark, their assessment has not been incorporated in the detection of early or precancers, when treatment is most effective. Here, we demonstrate that metabolic changes are detected in freshly excised human cervical precancerous tissues using label-free, non-destructive imaging of the entire epithelium. The images rely on two-photon excited fluorescence from two metabolic co-enzymes, NAD(P)H and FAD, and have micron-level resolution, enabling sensitive assessments of the redox ratio and mitochondrial fragmentation, which yield metrics of metabolic function and heterogeneity. Simultaneous characterization of morphological features, such as the depth-dependent variation of the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, is demonstrated. Multi-parametric analysis combining several metabolic metrics with morphological ones enhances significantly the diagnostic accuracy of identifying high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Our results motivate the translation of such functional metabolic imaging to in vivo studies, which may enable improved identification of cervical lesions, and other precancers, at the bedside.

Abstract: Extensive literature has demonstrated that acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells show enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) compared with normal hematopoietic progenitors, and one hallmark of AML leukaemia blasts is myeloid differentiation blockade. However, relatively few reports have linked these processes. Recent studies have indicated that therapies that overcome differentiation arrest represent an effective treatment strategy. Here, we identified that the disruption of the mitochondrial mass and energy metabolism promotes leukaemia cellular myeloid differentiation. In this study, we showed that acute monocytic leukaemia (AML-M5) cells package mitochondria in microvesicles (MVs) when MVs shed from membranes. Additionally, during myeloid differentiation, we report for the first time that differentiated leukaemia cells release more MVs than undifferentiated leukaemia cells. Targeting the formation of MVs using a specific inhibitor (Y-27632) restrained myeloid differentiation, suggesting that the increased release level of MVs plays an important role in regulating myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, the intracellular mitochondria and ATP levels were decreased after leukaemia cells overcame the differentiation blockade. Moreover, rotenone, which is used to inhibit the respiratory chain and ATP production, had a strong effect on myeloid differentiation in monocytic leukaemia cells. Collectively, these studies uncovered the relationship between mitochondrial function and myeloid differentiation and may provide more insight into the diagnosis and treatment of AML.

Abstract: Summary
Phenotypes of haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs) are dominant for recessive traits in mice. However, one major obstacle to their use is self-diploidization in daily culture. Although haESCs maintain haploidy well by deleting p53, whether they can sustain haploidy in differentiated status and the mechanism behind it remain unknown. To address this, we induced p53-deficient haESCs into multiple differentiated lineages maintain haploid status in vitro. Haploid cells also remained in chimeric embryos and teratomas arising from p53-null haESCs. Transcriptome analysis revealed that apoptosis genes were downregulated in p53-null haESCs compared with that in wild-type haESCs. Finally, we knocked out p73, another apoptosis-related gene, and observed stabilization of haploidy in haESCs. These results indicated that the main mechanism of diploidization was apoptosis-related gene-triggered cell death in haploid cell cultures. Thus, we can derive haploid somatic cells by manipulating the apoptosis gene, facilitating genetic screens of lineage-specific development.

Abstract: As two most common progressive diseases of aging, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were all characterized by endocrine and metabolic disorders. Here, our clinical study showed that there were significant differences in fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and prostate volume (PV) between simple BPH patients and BPH complicated with T2DM patients. Further analysis showed that HOMA-IR was positively correlated with PV in BPH complicated with T2DM patients. The in vitro experiment results showed that high glucose (HG) promoted EMT process in a glucose-dependent manner in human prostate hyperplasia cells (BPH-1) and prostate cancer cells (PC-3), and this pathological process was exacerbated by co-culture with insulin. Mechanistically, insulin-induced exacerbation of EMT was depended on the activation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway, and we suggested that insulin and its analogs should be used very carefully for the clinical antihyperglycemic treatment of BPH complicated with T2DM patients.

Abstract: Summary
Many bacterial plant pathogens employ a type III secretion system to inject effector proteins within plant cells to suppress plant immunity. Whether and how effector proteins also co-opt plant metabolism to support extensive bacterial replication remains an open question. Here, we show that Ralstonia solanacearum, the causal agent of bacterial wilt disease, secretes the effector protein RipI, which interacts with plant glutamate decarboxylases (GADs) to alter plant metabolism and support bacterial growth. GADs are activated by calmodulin and catalyze the biosynthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an important signaling molecule in plants and animals. RipI promotes the interaction of GADs with calmodulin, enhancing the production of GABA. R. solanacearum is able to replicate efficiently using GABA as a nutrient, and both RipI and plant GABA contribute to a successful infection. This work reveals a pathogenic strategy to hijack plant metabolism for the biosynthesis of nutrients that support microbial growth during plant colonization.

Abstract: This study examined the role of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (CDK1A, p21) in response to exogenous stressors during mouse preimplantation embryo development. CDKN1A knockdown (KD) one-cell zygotes were exposed to 39°C heat stress (HS) for 4 days or irradiated by 1 (1-Gy) or 3 (3-Gy) Gy X-rays, and their developmental competence and gene expression were compared with control embryos. CDKN1A KD and HS did not influence early cleavage or subsequent embryonic development; however, HS delayed cavitation and induced elevated Cdkn1a expression in control embryos. Exposure to 1- or 3-Gy had no effect on development to the morula stage; however, a significant number of morulae failed to develop to the blastocyst stage. Interestingly, under the 1-Gy condition, the blastocyst rate of CDKN1A KD embryos (77.7%) was significantly higher than that of the controls (44.4%). In summary, exposure to cellular stressors resulted in the upregulation of Cdkn1a in embryos exposed to HS or X-ray irradiation, particularly in response to heat stress or low-dose X-ray irradiation, and depleting Cdkn1a mRNA alleviated cell cycle arrest. These findings suggest that CDKN1A plays a vital role in cellular senescence during preimplantation embryo development.

Abstract: Summary
There are as yet no licensed therapeutics for the COVID-19 pandemic. The causal coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds host cells via a trimeric spike whose receptor binding domain (RBD) recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, initiating conformational changes that drive membrane fusion. We find that the monoclonal antibody CR3022 binds the RBD tightly, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2, and report the crystal structure at 2.4 Å of the Fab/RBD complex. Some crystals are suitable for screening for entry-blocking inhibitors. The highly conserved, structure-stabilizing CR3022 epitope is inaccessible in the prefusion spike, suggesting that CR3022 binding facilitates conversion to the fusion-incompetent post-fusion state. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis confirms that incubation of spike with CR3022 Fab leads to destruction of the prefusion trimer. Presentation of this cryptic epitope in an RBD-based vaccine might advantageously focus immune responses. Binders at this epitope could be useful therapeutically, possibly in synergy with an antibody that blocks receptor attachment.

Abstract: The differentiation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into specific neuronal subtypes has been exploited as an approach for modeling a variety of neurological disorders. However, achieving a highly pure population of neurons is challenging when using directed differentiation methods, especially for neuronal subtypes generated by complex and protracted protocols. In this study, we efficiently produced highly pure populations of regionally specified CNS neurons by using a modified NGN2-Puromycin direct conversion protocol. The protocol is amenable across a range of iPSC lines, with more than 95% of cells at day 21 positive for the neuronal marker MAP2. We found that conversion from pluripotent stem cells resulted in neurons from the central and peripheral nervous system; however, by incorporating a short CNS patterning step, we eliminated these peripheral neurons. Furthermore, we used the patterning step to control the rostral-caudal identity. This approach of sequential patterning and conversion produced pure populations of forebrain neurons, when patterned with SMAD inhibitors. Additionally, when SMAD inhibitors and WNT agonists were applied, the approach produced anterior hindbrain excitatory neurons and resulted in a neuronal population containing VSX2/SHOX2 V2a interneurons. Overall, this sequential patterning and conversion protocol can be used for the production of a variety of CNS excitatory neurons from patient-derived iPSCs, and is a highly versatile system for investigating early disease events for a range of neurological disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, motor neurons disease and spinal cord injury.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is an important underlying cause of cardiovascular diseases; vascular endothelial cells play a vital role in inflammatory responses in the initial steps of atherosclerosis. High levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) long have been considered a risk factor in the development and complications of atherosclerotic disease. However, it is still controversial whether IL-6 is atherogenic or atheroprotective. Recently, miR-126–3p, an endothelial cell-specific microRNA, has been proposed as an atheroprotective molecule. Therefore, we investigated whether IL-6 accelerates endothelial cell responses through the suppression of miR-126–3p expression in human endothelial cell line EA.hy926. IL-6 yielded concentration-dependent decreases in miRNA-126–3p accumulation in EA.hy926 cells, leading in turn to increased expression of genes targeted by miRNA-126–3p. In addition, adhesion of the human monocyte cell line THP-1 was enhanced by the exposure of EA.hy926 cells to IL-6, with associated increases in the levels of the adhesion molecule intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Suppression of miR-126–3p expression resulted in upregulation of miRNA-126-3p-regulated genes, enhanced adhesion of THP-1 cells, and increased ICAM-1 accumulation in EA.hy926 cells. In contrast, miR-126–3p overproduction had the opposite effects. The regulation of miRNA-126–3p by IL-6 may have important implications for the development of novel protective therapies targeting atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
In proteins with multiple functions, such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), the study of its intramolecular dynamic network can offer a unique opportunity to understand how a single protein is able to carry out several nonoverlapping functions. A dynamic mechanism that controls the MIF-induced activation of CD74 was recently discovered. In this study, the regulation of tautomerase activity was explored. The catalytic base Pro1 is found to form dynamic communications with the same allosteric node that regulates CD74 activation. Signal transmission between the allosteric and catalytic sites take place through intramolecular aromatic interactions and a hydrogen bond network that involves residues and water molecules of the MIF solvent channel. Once thought to be a consequence of trimerization, a regulatory function for the solvent channel is now defined. These results provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of catalytic activity and the role of solvent channel water molecules in MIF catalysis.

Abstract: The MUC16 C-terminal (MUC16c) level is associated with tumor serum CA-125 levels, however, the roles remain unclear in gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). In this study, we found that MUC16c promoted glucose uptake and glycolysis for GBC cell proliferation. Mass spectrometry analysis suggested that MUC16c could combine with aldolase. The ALDOC mRNA and protein are overexpressed in GBC tumors. The IHC results also showed the consistent up-regulation of. ALDOC and MUC16c level in GBC tumor tissues than in peritumor tissues. We determined that MUC16c combining with ALDOC promoted ALDOC protein stability and disrupted the ability of ALDOC sensing glucose deficiency, which activated AMPK pathway and increased GBC cell proliferation. ALDOC knockdown significantly inhibited the glucose uptake and glycolysis induced by MUC16c. Our study established important roles of MUC16c promoting GBC cell glycolysis and proliferation and revealed the underlying mechanism of CA-125-related heavy tumor metabolic burden in GBC.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived in vitro neural and organoid models resemble fetal, rather than adult brain properties, indicating that currently applied cultivation media and supplements are insufficient to achieve neural maturation beyond the fetal stage. In vivo, cerebrospinal fluid molecules are regulating the transition of the immature fetal human brain into a mature adult brain. By culturing hiPSC-3D neural aggregates in human cerebrospinal fluid (hCSF) obtained from healthy adult individuals, we demonstrate that hCSF rapidly triggers neurogenesis, gliogenesis, synapse formation, neurite outgrowth, suppresses proliferation of residing neural stem cells, and results in the formation of synchronously active neuronal circuits in vitro within 3 days. Thus, a physiologically relevant and adult brain-like milieu triggers maturation of hiPSC-3D neural aggregates into highly functional neuronal circuits in vitro. The approach presented here opens a new avenue to identify novel physiological factors for the improvement of hiPSC neural in vitro models.

Abstract: Summary
Although mitochondrial morphology is well-known for its role in cellular homeostasis, there is surprisingly little knowledge on whether mitochondrial remodeling is required for postnatal germ cell development. In this study, we investigated the functions of MFN1 and MFN2, two GTPases in mitochondrial fusion, during early spermatogenesis. We observed increased MFN expressions along with increased mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activities during spermatogonial differentiation. Deletion of either Mfn led to DNA oxidation and apoptosis specifically in differentiating spermatogonia and spermatocytes, which in turn caused male infertility. We further found MFN2 regulated spermatogenesis by modulating both mitochondrial and ER functions, a mechanism distinct from that of MFN1. Defects of germ cell development in MFN2 mutants were corrected by MFN2 at either mitochondria or ER but not by MFN1. Our study thus reveals an essential requirement of MFN-mediated mitochondrial and ER coordination in spermatogenesis, providing critical insights into mitochondrial determinants of male fertility.

Abstract: Summary
FAM122A is a highly conserved housekeeping gene, but its physiological and pathophysiological roles remain greatly elusive. Based on the fact that FAM122A is highly expressed in human CD71+ early erythroid cells, herein we report that FAM122A is downregulated during erythroid differentiation, while its overexpression significantly inhibits erythrocytic differentiation in primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells and erythroleukemia cells. Mechanistically, FAM122A directly interacts with the C-terminal zinc finger domain of GATA1, a critical transcriptional factor for erythropoiesis, and reduces GATA1 chromatin occupancy on the promoters of its target genes, thus resulting in the decrease of GATA1 transcriptional activity. The public datasets show that FAM122A is abnormally upregulated in patients with β-thalassemia. Collectively, our results demonstrate that FAM122A plays an inhibitory role in the regulation of erythroid differentiation, and it would be a potentially therapeutic target for GATA1-related dyserythropoiesis or an important regulator for amplifying erythroid cells ex vivo.
Keywords: FAM122A; erythroid differentiation; GATA1

Abstract: Summary
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is an enteric bacterial disease that is increasing in prevalence worldwide. C. difficile capitalizes on gut inflammation and microbiome dysbiosis to establish infection, with symptoms ranging from watery diarrhea to toxic megacolon. We reported that the safe-in-human clinical drug ebselen (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03013400, NCT01452607, NCT00762671, and NCT02603081) has biochemical, cell-based, and in vivo efficacy against the toxins of C. difficile. Here, we show that ebselen treatment reduces recurrence rates and decreases colitis in a hamster model of relapsing CDI. Furthermore, ebselen treatment does not alter microbiome diversity and promotes recovery back to that of healthy controls after antibiotic-induced dysbiosis in healthy and C. difficile-infected mice. This increased microbiome recovery upon ebselen treatment correlates with a decrease in host-derived inflammatory markers, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory properties of ebselen, combined with its anti-toxin function, help to mitigate the major clinical challenges of CDI, including recurrence, microbial dysbiosis, and colitis.

Abstract: Summary
Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) belong to the family Filoviridae. MARV causes severe disease in humans with high fatality. We previously isolated a large panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from B cells of a human survivor with previous naturally acquired MARV infection. Here, we characterized functional properties of these mAbs and identified non-neutralizing mAbs targeting the glycoprotein (GP) 2 portion of the mucin-like domain (MLD) of MARV GP, termed the wing region. One mAb targeting the GP2 wing, MR228, showed therapeutic protection in mice and guinea pigs infected with MARV. The protection was mediated by the Fc fragment functions of MR228. Binding of another GP2 wing-specific non-neutralizing mAb, MR235, to MARV GP increased accessibility of epitopes in the receptor-binding site (RBS) for neutralizing mAbs, resulting in enhanced virus neutralization by these mAbs. These findings highlight an important role for non-neutralizing mAbs during natural human MARV infection.

Abstract: Apoptotic cell death frequently occurs in human cancer tissues including oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), wherein apoptotic tumor cells are phagocytosed not only by macrophages but also by neighboring tumor cells. We previously reported that the engulfment of apoptotic SCC cells by neighboring SCC cells frequently occurs at the invading front. Therefore, we hypothesized that the phagocytosis of these apoptotic cells by tumor cells contributes to disease progression. Herein, using cultured oral SCC cells, we aimed to confirm whether tumor cells actually phagocytose apoptotic cells and to examine whether cellular activities are regulated by the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Co-culture experiments showed that living cells could ingest apoptotic cells into phagolysosomes. NSC23766, an inhibitor of Rac1, which is a key regulator of phagocytic cup formation in professional phagocytes, dramatically suppressed the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by living cells. Additionally, cell migration and the secretion of DKK1, a tumor-promoting protein, were enhanced by co-culture with apoptotic cells, whereas NSC23766 inhibited these effects. These results show that tumor cells can actively phagocytose apoptotic neighbors in a Rac1-dependent manner and that such activity increases their migration. The regulation of apoptotic cell phagocytosis thus represents new directions for therapeutic intervention for oral cancer.

The PI3K/AKT pathway promotes fracture healing through its crosstalk with Wnt/β-catenin,

Abstract: PI3K/AKT is one of the key pathways that regulate cell behaviors including apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. Although previous studies have demonstrated that this pathway is a crucial regulator of osteoblasts, the role of PI3K/AKT in fracture healing remains unclear. It is well known that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays an essential role in bone regeneration. However, whether there exists crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT in regulating osteoblasts and bone repair has not been reported. To address these issues, we establish a stabilized fracture model in mice and show that PI3K inhibitor LY294002 substantially inhibits the bone healing process, suggesting that PI3K/AKT promotes fracture repair. More importantly, we report that PI3K/AKT increases phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9 and phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser552 in fracture callus and murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, both of which lead to β-catenin stabilization, nuclear translocation, as well as β-catenin-mediated TCF-dependent transcription, suggesting that β-catenin is activated downstream of PI3K/AKT. Furthermore, we show that ICG001, the inhibitor of β-catenin transcriptional activity, attenuates PI3K/AKT-induced osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization, indicating that the PI3K/AKT/β-catenin axis is functional in regulating osteoblasts. Notably, the PI3K/AKT pathway is also activated by Wnt3a and is involved in Wnt3a-induced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Hence, our results reveal the existence of a Wnt/PI3K/AKT/β-catenin signaling nexus in osteoblasts, highlighting complex crosstalk between PI3K/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin pathways that are critically implicated in fracture healing.

Epigenetic regulation of the ITGB4 gene in prostate cancer,

Abstract: Background
Examination of epigenetic changes at the ITGB4 gene promoter reveals altered methylation at different stages of prostate tumour progression and these changes may, in part, explain the complex patterns of gene expression of this integrin observed. Transcriptional re-programming perturbs expression of cell adhesion molecules and underpins metastatic tumour cell behaviour. Decreasing expression of the cell adhesion molecule ITGB4, which encodes the beta subunit of the integrin, alpha6 beta4 (α6β4), has been correlated with increased tumour aggressiveness and metastasis in multiple tumour types including prostate cancer. Paradoxically, in vitro studies in tumour cell models demonstrate that ITGB4 mediates cell mobility and invasion. Herein we examined whether transcriptional re-programming by methylation influenced ITGB4 gene expression at different stages of prostate cancer progression. Bisulphite sequencing of a large CpG island in the ITGB4 gene promoter identified differentially methylated regions in prostate cancer cell lines representing a localised tumour (22Rv1), lymph node metastasis (LNCaP), and a bone metastasis (PC-3). The highest levels of methylation were observed in the CpG island surrounding the ITGB4 transcription start site in PC-3 cells, and this observation also correlated with higher gene expression of ITGB4 in these cells. Furthermore, PC-3 cells expressed two distinct transcripts, using an alternate transcription start site, which was not detected in other cell lines. In prostate tumour biopsy samples, patterns of methylation across the ITGB4 promoter were similar overall in matched primary and metastatic samples (n = 4 pairs), with a trend toward loss of methylation at specific sites in metastatic lesions.

Abstract: SETDB1 is a histone methyltransferase that converts H3K9me2 to H3K9me3. SETDB1 activity and H3K9me3 are crucial for the formation of obligately silenced heterochromatin such as that of centromeres. Here we show that a microRNA, miR-152-3p, is involved in the regulation of SETDB1 protein levels, but surprisingly, miR-152-3p plays a positive regulatory role for SETDB1 expression. Inhibition of miR-152-3p by anti-miR treatment resulted in a robust reduction in SETDB1 protein levels, though SETDB1 mRNA levels were unaffected. This was also accompanied by a blockade of the biochemical pathway proceeding from H3K9me2 to H3K9me3 as evidenced by quantitative nucleosome ELISA assays that showed that H3K9me2 accumulates in cells treated with an anti-miR that targets miR-152-3p. In addition, the action of a miR-152-3p mimic increased flux of the reaction leading to H3K9me3. We also performed site-directed mutagenesis of three predicted miR-152-3p target recognition sequences to yield three precise deletions. Deletion of one of the three sites recapitulated the positive regulatory aspect of the action of miR-152-3p upon SETDB1 expression in a luciferase reporter assay. Previous studies have shown that miR-152-3p negatively regulates DNMT1, the sole maintenance DNA methyltransferase which is required for levels of 5-methylcytosine levels within DNA. Our results shown that miR-152-3p positively regulates the production of H3K9me3 by regulating the production of SETDB1. Therefore, our findings provide strong evidence that miR-152-3p can serve as a toggle switch that regulates the balance between DNA methylation and H3K9 histone methylation in constitutive heterochromatin.

Abstract: Colon cancer shows characteristics of metastasis, which is associated with angiogenesis. Increasing evidence highlights long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as important participants in angiogenesis of cancers, including colon cancer. Hence, this study investigated the role of HNF1A-AS1 in angiogenesis of colon cancer. RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis were applied to detect HNF1A-AS1 and OTX1 expression in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. Then the interactions among HNF1A-AS1, PBX3, OTX1 and ERK/MAPK pathway were evaluated with RNA pull-down, RIP, ChIP and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays. Next, HCT116 and SW620 cells were treated with si-HNF1A-AS1 and/or oe-OTX1 plasmids to assess the effects of HNF1A-AS1 and OTX1 on angiogenesis, which was further evaluated in nude mice injected with SW620 cells transfected with sh-HNF1A-AS1 or sh-OTX1 lentivirus. HNF1A-AS1 and OTX1 were highly expressed in colon cancer. Silencing of HNF1A-AS1 inhibited angiogenesis of colon cancer in vivo and in vitro. HNF1A-AS1 increased the OTX1 expression by binding to transcription factor PBX3 to promote angiogenesis in colon cancer. Further, HNF1A-AS1 upregulated OTX1 to activate the ERK/MAPK pathway. Altogether, our findings identified HNF1A-AS1 as a tumor-promoting RNA in colon cancer, which could serve as a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer treatment.

Abstract: Pum2 is a ribonucleic acid binding protein that controls target mRNA turnover. It has been reported to be potentially associated with cardiac fibrosis. However, little is known about the role of Pum2 in cardiac disease. In this study, we found that Pum2 was upregulated in the rat heart tissue subjected to ischemia/reperfusion procedure and cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs) with hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) treatment. Further, knockdown of Pum2 showed a beneficial effect on H/R treated NRVMs through decreasing caspase 3-associated apoptosis, whereas overexpression of Pum2 increased H/R-induced NRVMs apoptosis. Moreover, our results demonstrated that Sirt1 was identified as the target of Pum2-mediated mRNA decay in cardiomyocytes, and two Pum2 binding elements were found in the 3′-untranslated region of Sirt1 mRNA. Additionally, overexpression of Pum2 prompted the acetylation of LKB1 by decreasing Sirt1's mRNA level, which in turn repressed the activity of AMPK pathway in both normoxic and H/R-treated NRVMs. Finally, our data indicated that the pro-apoptotic effect of Pum2 was dependent on Sirt1 and AMPK. Collectively, our results provide the evidence that Pum2-mediated Sirt1 mRNA decay plays a detrimental role in H/R-induced cardiomyocytes injury.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) to complete its infection cycle and causes severe hepatitis, with limited therapeutic options. To determine the prospect of T cell therapy in HBV/HDV co-infection, we study the impact of HDV on viral antigen processing and presentation. Using in vitro models of HBV/HDV co-infection, we demonstrate that HDV boosts HBV epitope presentation, both in HBV/HDV co-infected and neighboring mono-HBV-infected cells through the upregulation of the antigen processing pathway mediated by IFN-β/λ. Liver biopsies of HBV/HDV patients confirm this upregulation. We then validate in vitro and in a HBV/HDV preclinical mouse model that HDV infection increases the anti-HBV efficacy of T cells with engineered T cell receptors. Thus, by unveiling the effect of HDV on HBV antigen presentation, we provide a framework to better understand HBV/HDV immune pathology, and advocate the utilization of engineered HBV-specific T cells as a potential treatment for HBV/HDV co-infection.

Abstract: The present study was attempted to investigate the dynamics of HSPA1A and redox status in the spermatozoa and fluid of different segments of buck epididymis. Testes were collected from sexually mature and healthy bucks aged between 2 and 3 years. The fluid and spermatozoa from different segments (caput, corpus and cauda) were harvested for further processing and analysis. The concentration of HSPA1A in spermatozoa lysate and epididymal fluid and its relative mRNA expression in spermatozoa from different segments of epididymis were studied. The HSPA1A concentration in epididymal fluid was significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the corpus as compared with caput and cauda, whereas, its concentration and relative mRNA expression decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in the spermatozoa from caput to cauda. The activities of SOD, GR, GST, and concentrations of manoldialdehyde and ROS decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in the spermatozoa from caput to cauda. The glutathione concentration and GPx activity decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in the spermatozoa of cauda as compared with the corpus. The SOD activity and ROS concentration were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in corpus, and GR and GST activity were significantly (P < 0.01) higher in caput fluid as compared with corpus and cauda. It may be concluded that HSPA1A concentration and its relative mRNA expression in spermatozoa decreased progressively, and redox status was altered during transit from caput to cauda.

Abstract: Summary
The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus are known as neurogenic niches. We show that the median eminence (ME) of the hypothalamus comprises BrdU+ newly proliferating cells co-expressing NG2 (oligodendrocyte progenitors) and RIP (pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes), suggesting their differentiation toward mature oligodendrocytes (OLs). ME cells can generate neurospheres (NS) in vitro, which differentiate mostly to OLs compared with SVZ-NS that typically generate neurons. Interestingly, this population of oligodendrocyte progenitors is increased in the ME from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-affected mice. Notably, the thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) expressed by astrocytes, acts as negative regulator of oligodendrogenesis in vitro and is downregulated in the ME of EAE mice. Importantly, transplanted ME-NS preferentially differentiate to MBP+ OLs compared with SVZ-NS in Shiverer mice. Hence, discovering the ME as a new site for myelin-producing cells has a great importance for advising future therapy for demyelinating diseases and spinal cord injury.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the remarkable microbial diversity found within humans, our ability to link genes to phenotypes is based upon a handful of model microorganisms. We report a comparative genomics platform for Eggerthella lenta and other Coriobacteriia, a neglected taxon broadly relevant to human health and disease. We uncover extensive genetic and metabolic diversity and validate a tool for mapping phenotypes to genes and sequence variants. We also present a tool for the quantification of strains from metagenomic sequencing data, enabling the identification of genes that predict bacterial fitness. Competitive growth is reproducible under laboratory conditions and attributable to intrinsic growth rates and resource utilization. Unique signatures of in vivo competition in gnotobiotic mice include an adhesin enriched in poor colonizers. Together, these computational and experimental resources represent a strong foundation for the continued mechanistic dissection of the Coriobacteriia and a template that can be applied to study other genetically intractable taxa.

Abstract: Summary
Clonal evolution of osimertinib-resistance mechanisms in EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma is poorly understood. Using multi-region whole-exome and RNA sequencing of prospectively collected pre- and post-osimertinib-resistant tumors, including at rapid autopsies, we identify a likely mechanism driving osimertinib resistance in all patients analyzed. The majority of patients acquire two or more resistance mechanisms either concurrently or in temporal sequence. Focal copy-number amplifications occur subclonally and are spatially and temporally separated from common resistance mutations such as EGFR C797S. MET amplification occurs in 66% (n = 6/9) of first-line osimertinib-treated patients, albeit spatially heterogeneous, often co-occurs with additional acquired focal copy-number amplifications and is associated with early progression. Noteworthy osimertinib-resistance mechanisms discovered include neuroendocrine differentiation without histologic transformation, PD-L1, KRAS amplification, and ESR1-AKAP12, MKRN1-BRAF fusions. The subclonal co-occurrence of acquired genomic alterations upon osimertinib resistance will likely require targeting multiple resistance mechanisms by combination therapies.

Abstract: Summary
The human microbiome encodes extensive metabolic capabilities, but our understanding of the mechanisms linking gut microbes to human metabolism remains limited. Here, we focus on the conversion of cholesterol to the poorly absorbed sterol coprostanol by the gut microbiota to develop a framework for the identification of functional enzymes and microbes. By integrating paired metagenomics and metabolomics data from existing cohorts with biochemical knowledge and experimentation, we predict and validate a group of microbial cholesterol dehydrogenases that contribute to coprostanol formation. These enzymes are encoded by ismA genes in a clade of uncultured microorganisms, which are prevalent in geographically diverse human cohorts. Individuals harboring coprostanol-forming microbes have significantly lower fecal cholesterol levels and lower serum total cholesterol with effects comparable to those attributed to variations in lipid homeostasis genes. Thus, cholesterol metabolism by these microbes may play important roles in reducing intestinal and serum cholesterol concentrations, directly impacting human health.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells display metabolic plasticity to survive stresses in the tumor microenvironment. Cellular adaptation to energetic stress is coordinated in part by signaling through the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Here, we demonstrate that miRNA-mediated silencing of LKB1 confers sensitivity of lymphoma cells to mitochondrial inhibition by biguanides. Using both classic (phenformin) and newly developed (IM156) biguanides, we demonstrate that elevated miR-17∼92 expression in Myc+ lymphoma cells promotes increased apoptosis to biguanide treatment in vitro and in vivo. This effect is driven by the miR-17-dependent silencing of LKB1, which reduces AMPK activation in response to complex I inhibition. Mechanistically, biguanide treatment induces metabolic stress in Myc+ lymphoma cells by inhibiting TCA cycle metabolism and mitochondrial respiration, exposing metabolic vulnerability. Finally, we demonstrate a direct correlation between miR-17∼92 expression and biguanide sensitivity in human cancer cells. Our results identify miR-17∼92 expression as a potential biomarker for biguanide sensitivity in malignancies.

Abstract: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators that participate in multiple biological processes, including cancer formation and progression. The biological function and molecular mechanism of LINC00612 in the progression of osteosarcoma has not been elucidated before. In this study, we evaluated the expression of LINC00612 in osteosarcoma by qRT‐PCR. ShRNA‐induced LINC00612 downregulation and plasmid-transduced LINC00612 overexpression were conducted in U2OS and HOS cells. The in vitro functional effects of LINC00612 downregulation and overexpression on osteosarcoma cells were evaluated by CCK‐8 assay, colony formation assay, scratch assay, transwell invasion assay and flow cytometry; in vivo tumor xenografts were conducted in nude mice. The effects of LINC00612 downregulation and overexpression on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were assessed by scratch assay, transwell assay and qRT‐PCR. The possibility of LINC00612 acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to target microRNA miR-214–5p was examined by dual‐luciferase reporter assay. Then, miR-214–5p was downregulated or overexpressed to examine its effect on invasion and SOX4 expression in osteosarcoma cells. LINC00612 was found to be significantly upregulated in osteosarcoma cells and metastatic osteosarcoma. LINC00612 overexpression promoted the proliferation, invasion and in vivo explant growth of osteosarcoma. In addition, LINC00612 overexpression regulated EMT by elevating the expression of ZEB1, Snail, and Fibronectin 1 and inhibiting E-cadherin. MiR-214–5p was confirmed to be a ceRNA of LINC00612. LINC00612 overexpression upregulated SOX4 by inhibiting miR-214–5p. Our study shows that LINC00612 plays an important role in regulating the proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma by endogenously competing with miR-214–5p and mediating EMT.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins play an important role in immune inflammation and the formation and restoration of proteins. In recent years, the importance of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in the activation of immune inflammation through nuclear factor kB (NFkB) has been discussed. To assess the activation of the Hsp90-NFkB system by measuring serum and urinary levels in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN). This study included 32 patients with active forms of CGN and 14 patients with Fabry nephropathy. The control group included 10 healthy individuals. Twenty-one out of 32 CGN patients had nephrotic syndrome (NS). Eleven out of 32 CGN patients had proteinuria levels from 1 to 3 g/day without nephrotic syndrome. A total of 17 patients had renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/1.73m2). Fourteen patients with Fabry nephropathy had proteinuria without nephrotic syndrome. Serum and urine HSP-90 and NFkB p65 levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of HSP-90 and NFkB in the serum of patients with CGN were significantly higher than in healthy individuals and patients with Fabry nephropathy. In patients with Fabry nephropathy, the HSP-90 and NFkB levels in the urine and serum did not significantly differ from those in the control subjects. Serum Hsp90 levels were significantly higher in the CGN patients with NS than in patients without NS, as well as in patients with normal renal function compared with patients with an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and patients with tubulo-interstitial fibrosis. Higher levels of HSP-90 and NFkB in serum were observed in patients with nephrotic forms of CGN, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy. There were no correlations between the clinical signs of CGN and urinary HSP90/NFkB levels. Activation of the HSP-90-NFkB system, which is directly involved in the development of immune inflammation in CGN, was found in patients with an active course of CGN, especially in those with nephrotic syndrome.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignancy in thyroid. miR-744–5p plays an efficient role in various cancers, but its role in PTC remains unknown. In this work, we aimed to explore the function of miR-744–5p and the mechanism by which miR-744–5p acted in PTC. We observed that miR-744–5p expression was significantly declined in PTC tissues and cell lines. The high level of miR-744–5p is significantly associated with a better clinical picture of PTC patients. Overexpression of miR-744–5p inhibited the proliferation, arrested the cell cycle, and promoted the apoptosis in PTC cells. Oppositely, down-regulation of miR-744–5p reversed the above tendencies. We also found that miR-744–5p down-regulated its downstream genes c-myc and attenuated cell proliferation induced by c-myc. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTTIP was found to be up-regulated and to act as an oncogene in PTC. In this study, miR-744–5p bound to HOTTIP and was negatively regulated by HOTTIP. In conclusion, miR-744-5p acts as a tumor suppressor to inhibit proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of PTC cells via targeting c-myc. Moreover, miR-744-5p expression interferes with lncRNA HOTTIP ability to promote proliferation and downregulate apoptosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Abstract: Summary
Spermatogenesis relies on exquisite stem cell homeostasis, the carefully balanced self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Disturbing this equilibrium will likely manifest through sub- or infertility, a global health issue with often idiopathic presentation. In this respect, disease phenotypes caused by haploinsufficiency of otherwise vital developmental genes are of particular interest. Here, we show that mice heterozygous for Trim28, an essential epigenetic regulator, suffer gradual testicular degeneration. Contrary to previous reports we detect Trim28 expression in spermatogonia, albeit at low levels. Further reduction through Trim28 heterozygosity increases the propensity of SSCs to differentiate at the cost of self-renewal.

Abstract: Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on the surface of tumour cells can cause tumour immune evasion. Benefits of combining anti-PD-L1 therapy with nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have been reported. However, some patients cannot tolerate the immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) caused by antibody-based immunotherapy. BRD4 is a member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family. BRD4 inhibition has shown antitumour effects in many tumours, but its role in TNBC has not been definitively concluded. In particular, the immune regulation of BRD4 in TNBC has been rarely studied. In this study, we used JQ1, a BET inhibitor, and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting BRD4 to explore the influence of BRD4 on PD-L1 expression in TNBC. The results indicated that BRD4 inhibition suppressed PD-L1 expression and the PD-L1 upregulation induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). In the in vivo experiments, we found that JQ1 not only reduced the PD-L1 expression level but also changed the proportions of T lymphocyte subsets in the spleens of tumour-bearing mice, which helped to relieve immunosuppression. Briefly, our study reveals that BRD4 regulates PD-L1 expression and may provide a potential method for blocking the programmed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 immune checkpoint in TNBC.

Abstract: CARF (Collaborator of ARF) was discovered as an ARF-interacting protein that activated ARF-p53-p21WAF1 signaling involved in cellular response to a variety of stresses, including oxidative, genotoxic, oncogenic, or telomere deprotection stresses, leading to senescence, growth arrest, or apoptosis. Of note, whereas suppression of CARF was lethal, its enrichment was associated with increased proliferation and malignant transformation of cells. These reports have predicted that CARF could serve as a multi-stress marker with a predictive value for cell fates. Here, we recruited various in vitro stress models and examined their effect on CARF expression using human normal fibroblasts. We demonstrate that CARF levels in stress and post-stress conditions could predict the fate of cells towards either death or enhanced proliferation and malignant transformation. We provide extensive molecular evidence that (i) CARF expression changes in response to stress, (ii) it modulates cell death or survival signaling and determines the fate of cells, and (iii) it may serve as a predictive measure of cellular response to stress and an important marker for biosafety.

Abstract: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a significant obstacle for immunotherapy of cancer. It is of great clinical relevance to study the mechanism of MDSCs accumulation in mouse spleens and establish a stable method to obtain high-purity MDSCs in vitro for further research. Here, we established a new method for amplifying a large number of highly pure MDSCs in vitro. To mimic the microenvironment of MDSCs development in vivo, mouse splenic stroma feeder cells and serum-free medium containing granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were used to induce myeloid precursors in mouse bone marrow cells, which differentiate into MDSCs. Development and immunological functions of the cells were monitored both in vivo and in vitro. A total of 4 × 108 MDSCs could be obtained from the bone marrow from one mouse, the ratio of CD11b+Gr-1+ MDSCs could reach 93.8% ± 3.3% after nine days of culture in vitro. Cultured MDSCs maintained a similar immunophenotype with MDSCs found in tumor-bearing mice. Colony forming assay in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that these were myeloid precursor cells. These cells generated high levels of reactive oxygen species and arginase 1 to prevent proliferation of CD8+ T cells in vitro. These also increased regulatory T (Treg) cells in blood while promoting the growth of lymphoma in vivo. In addition, cultured MDSCs effectively inhibited acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Our findings suggest that mouse splenic stroma plays an important role in the generation of MDSCs and represent a preliminary mechanism for the accumulation of MDSCs in spleens, and thereby lay the foundation for basic research and the clinical application of MDSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Engineered CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators can potently and specifically activate endogenous fate-determining genes to direct differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that endogenous activation of the PAX7 transcription factor results in stable epigenetic remodeling and differentiates human pluripotent stem cells into skeletal myogenic progenitor cells. Compared with exogenous overexpression of PAX7 cDNA, we find that endogenous activation results in the generation of more proliferative myogenic progenitors that can maintain PAX7 expression over multiple passages in serum-free conditions while preserving the capacity for terminal myogenic differentiation. Transplantation of human myogenic progenitors derived from endogenous activation of PAX7 into immunodeficient mice resulted in a greater number of human dystrophin+ myofibers compared with exogenous PAX7 overexpression. RNA-sequencing analysis also revealed transcriptome-wide differences between myogenic progenitors generated via CRISPR-based endogenous activation of PAX7 and exogenous PAX7 cDNA overexpression. These studies demonstrate the utility of CRISPR/Cas9-based transcriptional activators for controlling cell-fate decisions.

Abstract: Podocytes are actin-rich epithelial cells whose effacement and detachment are the main cause of glomerular disease. Crk family proteins: Crk1/2 and CrkL are reported to be important intracellular signaling proteins that are involved in many biological processes. However, the roles of them in maintaining podocyte morphology and function remain poorly understood. In this study, specific knocking down of Crk1/2 and CrkL in podocytes caused abnormal cell morphology, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and dysfunction in cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and viability. The p130Cas, focal adhesion kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, p38 and JNK signaling pathways involved in these alterations. Furthermore, knocking down CrkL alone conferred a more modest phenotype than did the Crk1/2 knockdown and the double knockdown. Kidney biopsy specimens from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and minimal change nephropathy showed downregulation of Crk1/2 and CrkL in glomeruli. In zebrafish embryos, Crk1/2 and CrkL knockdown compromised the morphology and caused abnormal glomerular development. Thus, our results suggest that Crk1/2 and CrkL expression are important in podocytes; loss of either will cause podocyte dysfunction, leading to foot process effacement and podocyte detachment.

Abstract: Summary
Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged and rapidly spread throughout the world, resulting in a global public health emergency. The lack of vaccine and antivirals has brought an urgent need for an animal model. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we generated a mouse model expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) by using CRISPR/Cas9 knockin technology. In comparison with wild-type C57BL/6 mice, both young and aged hACE2 mice sustained high viral loads in lung, trachea, and brain upon intranasal infection. Although fatalities were not observed, interstitial pneumonia and elevated cytokines were seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected-aged hACE2 mice. Interestingly, intragastric inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 was seen to cause productive infection and lead to pulmonary pathological changes in hACE2 mice. Overall, this animal model described here provides a useful tool for studying SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis and evaluating COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
One approach to understanding how tissue-specific cancers emerge is to determine the requirements for “reprograming” such neoplastic cells back to their developmentally normal primordial pre-malignant epiblast-like pluripotent state and then scrutinizing their spontaneous reconversion to a neoplasm, perhaps rendering salient the earliest pivotal oncogenic pathway(s) (before other aberrations accumulate in the adult tumor). For the prototypical malignancy anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), we found that tonic RAS reduction was obligatory for reprogramming cancer cells to a normal epiblast-emulating cells, confirmed by changes in their transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles, loss of neoplastic behavior, and ability to derive normal somatic cells from their “epiblast organoids.” Without such suppression, ATCs re-emerged from the clones. Hence, for ATC, RAS inhibition was its “reprogram enablement” (RE) factor. Each cancer likely has its own RE factor; identifying it may illuminate pre-malignant risk markers, better classifications, therapeutic targets, and tissue-specification of a previously pluripotent, now neoplastic, cell.

Abstract: Summary
Clostridioides difficile infection of the colon leads to severe inflammation and damage to the gastrointestinal epithelium due to the production of potent toxins. This inflammatory tissue damage causes the liberation of high concentrations of host heme at infection sites. Here, we identify the C. difficile heme-sensing membrane protein system (HsmRA) and show that this operon induces a protective response that repurposes heme to counteract antimicrobial oxidative stress responses. HsmR senses vertebrate heme, leading to increased expression of the hsmRA operon and subsequent deployment of HsmA to capture heme and reduce redox damage caused by inflammatory mediators of protection and antibiotic therapy. Strains with inactivated hsmR or hsmA have increased sensitivity to redox-active compounds and reduced colonization persistence in a murine model of relapse C. difficile infection. These results define a mechanism exploited by C. difficile to repurpose toxic heme within the inflamed gut as a shield against antimicrobial compounds.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell-based transplantation therapies offer hope for currently untreatable retinal degenerations; however, preclinical progress has been largely confined to rodent models. Here, we describe an experimental platform for accelerating photoreceptor replacement therapy in the nonhuman primate, which has a visual system much more similar to the human. We deployed fluorescence adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (FAOSLO) to noninvasively track transplanted photoreceptor precursors over time at cellular resolution in the living macaque. Fluorescently labeled photoreceptors generated from a CRX+/tdTomato human embryonic stem cell (hESC) reporter line were delivered subretinally to macaques with normal retinas and following selective ablation of host photoreceptors using an ultrafast laser. The fluorescent reporter together with FAOSLO allowed transplanted photoreceptor precursor survival, migration, and neurite formation to be monitored over time in vivo. Histological examination suggested migration of photoreceptor precursors to the outer plexiform layer and potential synapse formation in ablated areas in the macaque eye.

Abstract: Summary
The CDY (chromodomain on the Y) proteins play an essential role in normal spermatogenesis and brain development. Dysregulation of their expression has been linked to male infertility and various neurological diseases. Like the chromodomains of HP1 and Polycomb, the CDY chromodomains also recognize the lysine-methylated ARKS motif embedded in histone and non-histone proteins. Interestingly, the CDY chromodomains exhibit different binding preferences for the lysine-methylated ARKS motif in different sequence contexts. Here, we present the structural basis for selective binding of CDY1 to H3K9me3 and preferential binding of CDYL2 to H3tK27me3 over H3K27me3. In addition, we use a CDYL1/2-selective compound, UNC4850, to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying CDYL2 binding specificity. Our work also provides critical implications that CDYL1b's role in the regulation of neural development is dependent on its recognition of the lysine-methylated ARKS motif.

Abstract: Summary
Pharmacophore-focused chemical libraries are continuously being created in drug discovery programs, yet screening assays to maximize the usage of such libraries are not fully explored. Here, we report a chemical proteomics approach to reutilizing a focused chemical library of 1,800 indole-containing molecules for discovering uncharacterized ligand-protein pairs. Gel-based protein profiling of the library using a photo-affinity indole probe 1 enabled us to find new ligands for glyoxalase 1 (Glo1), an enzyme involved in the detoxification of methylglyoxal. Structure optimization of the ligands yielded an inhibitor for Glo1 (9). Molecule 9 increased the cellular methylglyoxal levels in human cells and suppressed the osteoclast formation of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. X-ray structure analyses revealed that the molecule lies at a site abutting the substrate binding site, which is consistent with the enzyme kinetic profile of 9. Overall, this study exemplifies how chemical proteomics can be used to exploit existing focused chemical libraries.

Abstract: Summary
The search for antimalarial chemotypes with modes of action unrelated to existing drugs has intensified with the recent failure of first-line therapies across Southeast Asia. Here, we show that the trisubstituted imidazole MMV030084 potently inhibits hepatocyte invasion by Plasmodium sporozoites, merozoite egress from asexual blood stage schizonts, and male gamete exflagellation. Metabolomic, phosphoproteomic, and chemoproteomic studies, validated with conditional knockdown parasites, molecular docking, and recombinant kinase assays, identified cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) as the primary target of MMV030084. PKG is known to play essential roles in Plasmodium invasion of and egress from host cells, matching MMV030084's activity profile. Resistance selections and gene editing identified tyrosine kinase-like protein 3 as a low-level resistance mediator for PKG inhibitors, while PKG itself never mutated under pressure. These studies highlight PKG as a resistance-refractory antimalarial target throughout the Plasmodium life cycle and promote MMV030084 as a promising Plasmodium PKG-targeting chemotype.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes-associated complication characterized by irreversible deterioration of the microvessels within the retina, leading subsequently to severe retinal damage and vision loss. Vitamin D (VITD), a steroid hormone, plays multiple physiological functions in cellular homeostasis. Deficiency of VITD has been suggested to be associated with DR. To study the potential protective function of VITD in DR, high-glucose-treated ARPE-19 cells and STZ-induced diabetic mice were used as in vitro and in vivo models. The protective effects of VITD were assessed based on the changes of expression of antioxidant enzymes and cytokines in high-glucose-treated retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and in the retina and RPE of diabetic and VITD-treated diabetic mice. The present study demonstrated that exposure to a high level of glucose caused upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a decrease in anti-oxidant enzyme expression in both in vitro and in vivo models. VITD treatment increased cell viability, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and caspase-3/7 activities in high-glucose-treated RPE cells. Our data suggest that VITD can protect the retina and RPE from high-glucose-induced oxidative damage and inflammation.

Abstract: Cdc14a is an evolutionarily conserved dual-specific protein phosphatase, and it plays different roles in different organisms. Cdc14a mutations in human have been reported to cause male infertility, while the specific role of Cdc14a in regulation of the male reproductive system remains elusive. In the present study, we established a knockout mouse model to study the function of Cdc14a in male reproductive system. Cdc14a−/− male mice were subfertile and they could only produce very few offspring. The number of sperm was decreased, the sperm motility was impaired, and the proportion of sperm with abnormal morphology was elevated in Cdc14a−/− mice. When we mated Cdc14a−/− male mice with wild-type (WT) female mice, fertilized eggs could be found in female fallopian tubes, however, the majority of these embryos died during development. Some empty spaces were observed in seminiferous tubule of Cdc14a−/− testes. Compared with WT male mice, the proportions of pachytene spermatocytes were increased and germ cells stained with γH2ax were decreased in Cdc14a−/− male mice, indicating that knockout of Cdc14a inhibited meiotic initiation. Subsequently, we analyzed the expression levels of some substrate proteins of Cdc14a, including Cdc25a, Wee1, and PR-Set7, and compared those with WT testes, in which the expression levels of these proteins were significantly increased in Cdc14a−/− testes. Our results revealed that Cdc14a−/− male mice are highly subfertile, and Cdc14a is essential for normal spermatogenesis and sperm function.

Abstract: MLN4924/Pevonedistat, a Nedd8-activating enzyme (NAE, E1) inhibitor, has shown notable anti-cancer effect in pre-clinical trials, but it still faces tolerance resistance risk. Combination target therapy indicates a much better clinical effect than single target, and miRNAs are beneficial for easy detection in bodily fluids and tissues. Up to now, MLN4924 and miRNA-targeting combination approaching to treat breast cancer patients remains largely unknown. Here, microRNA-seq analysis showed that the expression of miR-1303 was significantly decreased after MLN4924 treatment in breast cancer cells. Moreover, miR-1303 was abnormally high in breast cancer tissues, and breast cancer patients with high miR-1303 showed poor prognosis. Functionally, excessive miR-1303 promoted the malignant phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Excessive miR-1303 accelerated cell cycle progression by promoting G2/M arrest. Furthermore, we revealed that miR-1303 targeted p27Kip1 to release G2/M arrest. Notably, excessive miR-1303 partially disturbed the anti-cancer effect of MLN4924. These findings provide potential evidences for combined anti-cancer target therapy of breast cancer patients in the future.

Abstract: Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (diethylhexyl phthalate, DEHP) can cause male reproductive damage in rodents and human. Moreover, DEHP is known to promote transgenerational inheritance of adult-onset disease in subsequent generations after maternal exposure during fetal gonadal development. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway has been implicated in germ cell survival following testicular damage. In this study, a F0 gestation DEHP exposure and transgenerational inheritance testis injury model was established to study the testis injury phenotype and the expression and activation of members of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in the testis of F1–F3 generation mice. We found that the bodyweight and the anogenital distance (AGD) are reduced only in F1 mice, the sperm motility and deformity decreased in F1–F3 mice, and the testicular histomorphology damagedin F1–F3 mice; however the sperm motility and deformity rates are increased and the histomorphological injury is repaired during the transgenerational process. We also found the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is enhanced in F1 and F2, and the number of apoptotic cells is decreased in F3 generation mice compared to the control group. These results suggest that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway may be activated to promote the proliferation and differentiation and protect testicular cells from apoptosis in the F1 and F2 generation mice after direct exposure to DEHP.

Abstract: Summary
The identification of SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase) as a target for modulating gain-of-function NOTCH1 mutations in Notch-dependent cancers has spurred the development of this compound class for cancer therapeutics. Despite the innate toxicity challenge associated with SERCA inhibition, we identified CAD204520, a small molecule with better drug-like properties and reduced off-target Ca2+ toxicity compared with the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin. In this work, we describe the properties and complex structure of CAD204520 and show that CAD204520 preferentially targets mutated over wild-type NOTCH1 proteins in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Uniquely among SERCA inhibitors, CAD204520 suppresses NOTCH1-mutated leukemic cells in a T-ALL xenografted model without causing cardiac toxicity. This study supports the development of SERCA inhibitors for Notch-dependent cancers and extends their application to cases with isolated mutations in the PEST degradation domain of NOTCH1, such as MCL or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

Abstract: Skeletal muscle preservation is a dynamic process that involves constant repair and regeneration. However, the regenerative capacity of muscle cells declines in hyperglycemia. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this glucotoxicity during myoblast differentiation. C2C12 cells were exposed to different concentrations of glucose, to recapitulate the development of skeletal muscles in vivo in normo- and hyperglycemic conditions. In high glucose conditions, we found significant increases in levels of total cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a reorganization of SUMO enzyme transcripts and SUMOylated proteins. Furthermore, in anticipation of the ROS-induced damage to newly formed myotubes, we observed acceleration of myogenesis. Interestingly, we found a tight relationship between SUMOylation of the Histone methyltransferase SET7/9 and the maintenance of sarcomeric structures of newly formed myotubes. Finally, treatment with the antioxidant anacardic acid preserved the function and activity of myotubes generated in high-glucose conditions by interfering with both ROS and SUMO pathways. Combined, these results suggest that increased oxidative stress and modulation of SUMO reactions are key mediators of glucotoxicity and inhibition of these perturbations using antioxidants might improve muscle regeneration in hyperglycemia.

Abstract: Dysfunction of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) is involved in the pathogenesis of steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to biological effects exerted on BMSCs by regulating the expression of genes. However, most recent studies have focused on the role of lncRNAs in modulating the imbalance between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation but not apoptosis, proliferation, cell cycle and migration of BMSCs, especially in Dex-treated BMSCs. In this study, we conducted a microarray analysis to investigate the differential expression profiles of lncRNAs between human BMSCs (hBMSCs) obtained from patients with SONFH and control patients with femoral neck fracture. The microarray analysis showed that a total of 48 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in hBMSCs between the two groups, including 24 upregulated lncRNAs and 24 downregulated lncRNAs. Among of them, LINC00473 was found to be significantly downregulated. In the following study, we found that 10−6 mol/L Dex significantly inhibited proliferation, arrested cell cycle at the G1 phase, increased caspase-3 activity, induced apoptosis and impeded the migration of hBMSCs, while downregulation of the expression of LINC00473 produced results that were in line with the results of the microarray analysis in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, upregulation of LINC00473 attenuated the negative effects caused by 10−6 mol/L Dex on hBMSCs, except for cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, it should be noted that LINC00473 had no effect on the proliferation and cell cycle of hBMSCs in the absence of Dex. Collectively, our data revealed that LINC00473 attenuated apoptosis, promoted the proliferation and migration of Dex-induced hBMSCs, which are not involved in interference with the cell cycle of hBMSCs.

Abstract: Some traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been applied in bone repair, however, hydroxy-safflower yellow A (HYSA), one composition of safflower of the typical invigorating the circulation of TCM, has little been studied in orthopedics field for osteogenesis and angiogenesis clinically. Herein, we hypothetically speculated that the synthetic bioactive glasses (BG, 1393) scaffolds carried HYSA by a 3D print technique could enhance osteogenic repair properties. Notably, scaffolds coating chitosan/sodium alginate endowed with excellent drug control release ability, and significantly improved the BG mechanical strength. HYSA was loaded into BG scaffolds by coating chitosan/sodium alginate film, and the osteogenesis and angiogenesis of the HYSA/scaffolds were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro the cell culture results exhibited that the high dose of HYSA (0.5 mg/ml) loaded scaffolds can promote the proliferation of bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSCs) and migration, tubule formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The active alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of rBMSCs can also be improved by the high dose of HYSA/scaffolds. Results of qRT-PCR and Western blot indicated that the high dose of HYSA/scaffolds can up-regulate ALP, OCN, OPN and RUNX-2 expression and relative protein secretion of the HIF-1α and BMP-2. In the animal experiment, the high dose of HYSA/scaffolds has a significantly better capacity to promote new bone formation than the undoped scaffolds at 8 weeks post-surgery. Thus, our results claimed that the novel HYSA/scaffolds hold the substantial potential to be further developed as effective and safe bone tissue engineering biomaterials for bone regeneration by combining enhanced osteogenesis and angiogenesis.

Abstract: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been reported to be involved in several biological processes in tumors. In this study, we found that most of the m6A RNA methylation regulators were not only differentially expressed between clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and normal but also among ccRCC stratified by different clinicopathologic characters. Two ccRCC subgroups, cluster 1 and 2, were identified using consensus clustering based on the expression of m6A methylation regulators. Although no obvious differences were observed between two subgroups regarding clinicopathologic characters, except gender, patients in cluster 1 had a relatively more favorable survival rate than cluster 2. Moreover, we established a risk signature with two m6A methylation regulators, METTL3 and METTL14, which was not only of great value for prognosis prediction but also closely associated with clinicopathological features. In conclusion, m6A RNA methylation regulators play an important role in ccRCC progression and are potentially favorable for prognostic stratification.

Abstract: Endemic arsenism is widely distributed in the world, which can damage multiple organs, especially in skin and liver. The etiology is clear, but the mechanisms involved remain unknown. Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) is the main pathway regulating protein degradation of which proteasome subunit beta type-5(PSMB5) plays a dominant role. This paper aims to study the role and mechanism of PSMB5 in sodium arsenite (NaAsO2)–induced oxidative stress liver injury in L-02 cells. Firstly, L-02 cells were exposed to different concentrations of NaAsO2 to establish a liver injury model of oxidative stress, and then mechanisms of oxidative stress were studied with carbobenzoxyl-leucyl-leucl-leucll-line (MG132) and knockdown PSMB5 (PSMB5-siRNA). The oxidative stress indicators, levels of 20S proteasome, the transcription and protein expression levels of PSMB5, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) were detected. The results demonstrated that NaAsO2 could induce oxidative stress–induced liver injury and the activity of 20S proteasome and the protein expression of PSMB5, SOD1, and GPx1 decreased. After MG132 or PSMB5-siRNA pretreatment, the gene expression of PSMB decreased. After MG132 or PSMB5-siRNA pretreatment, and then L-02 cells were treated with NaAsO2, the gene expression of PSMB remarkably decreased; however, the protein expression of SOD1 and GPx1 increased. Overall, NaAsO2 exposure could induce oxidative stress liver injury and low expression of PSMB5 in L-02 cells, and PSMB5 might play an important role in the regulation of oxidative stress by regulating the expression of SOD1 and Gpx1.

Abstract: Summary
Naive and primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) provide valuable models to study cellular and molecular developmental processes. The lack of detailed information about cell-surface protein expression in these two pluripotent cell types prevents an understanding of how the cells communicate and interact with their microenvironments. Here, we used plasma membrane profiling to directly measure cell-surface protein expression in naive and primed hPSC. This unbiased approach quantified over 1,700 plasma membrane proteins, including those involved in cell adhesion, signaling, and cell interactions. Notably, multiple cytokine receptors upstream of JAK-STAT signaling were more abundant in naive hPSC. In addition, functional experiments showed that FOLR1 and SUSD2 proteins are highly expressed at the cell surface in naive hPSC but are not required to establish human naive pluripotency. This study provides a comprehensive stem cell proteomic resource that uncovers differences in signaling pathway activity and has identified new markers to define human pluripotent states.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays an essential role in gene repression during development, catalyzing H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). MTF2 in the PRC2.1 sub-complex, and JARID2 in PRC2.2, are central in core PRC2 recruitment to target genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). To investigate how PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 cooperate, we combined Polycomb mutant mESCs with chemical inhibition of binding to H3K27me3. We find that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 mediate two distinct paths for recruitment, which are mutually reinforced. Whereas PRC2.1 recruitment is mediated by MTF2 binding to DNA, JARID2-containing PRC2.2 recruitment is more dependent on PRC1. Both recruitment axes are supported by core subunit EED binding to H3K27me3, but EED inhibition exhibits a more pronounced effect in Jarid2 null cells. Finally, we show that PRC1 and PRC2 enhance reciprocal binding. Together, these data disentangle the interdependent interactions that are important for PRC2 recruitment.

Abstract: Summary
Chlorcyclizine (CCZ) is a potent hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry inhibitor, but its molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that CCZ directly targets the fusion peptide of HCV E1 and interferes with the fusion process. Generation of CCZ resistance-associated substitutions of HCV in vitro revealed six missense mutations in the HCV E1 protein, five being in the putative fusion peptide. A viral fusion assay demonstrated that CCZ blocked HCV entry at the membrane fusion step and that the mutant viruses acquired resistance to CCZ's action in blocking membrane fusion. UV cross-linking of photoactivatable CCZ-diazirine-biotin in both HCV-infected cells and recombinant HCV E1/E2 protein demonstrated direct binding to HCV E1 glycoprotein. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that CCZ cross-linked to an E1 sequence adjacent to the putative fusion peptide. Docking simulations demonstrate a putative binding model, wherein CCZ binds to a hydrophobic pocket of HCV E1 and forms extensive interactions with the fusion peptide.

Abstract: Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are common lung disorders characterized by alveolar-capillary barrier disruption and dyspnea, which can cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Currently, a cluster of acute respiratory illnesses, known as novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP), which allegedly originally occurred in Wuhan, China, has increased rapidly worldwide. The critically ill patients with ARDS have high mortality in subjects with comorbidities. Previously, the excessive recruitment and activation of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]), accompanied by neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation were reported being implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS. However, the direct visualization of lung epithelial injuries caused by NETs, and the qualitative and quantitative evaluations of this damage are still lacking. Additionally, those already reported methods are limited for their neglect of the pathological role exerted by NETs and focusing only on the morphological features of NETosis. Therefore, we established a cell-based assay for detecting NETs during lung epithelial cells-neutrophils co-culture using the xCELLigence system, a recognized real-time, dynamic, label-free, sensitive, and high-throughput apparatus. Our results demonstrated that lung epithelial injuries, reflected by declines in cell index (CI) values, could be induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated PMNs, or NETs in a time and dose-dependent manner. NETs generation was verified to be the major contributor to the cytotoxicity of activated PMNs; protein components of NETs were the prevailing cytotoxic mediators. Moreover, this cell-based assay identified that PMNs from severe pneumonia patients had a high NETs formative potential. Additionally, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and acetaminophen (APAP) were discovered alleviating NETs formation. Thus, this study not only presents a new methodology for detecting the pathophysiologic role of NETs but also lays down a foundation for exploring therapeutic interventions in an effort to cure ALI/ARDS in the clinical setting of severe pneumonia, including the emerging of NCIP.

Abstract: Transmembrane protein 88 (TMEM88) has emerged as a newly discovered cancer-related protein that acts as a cancer-promoting or cancer-inhibiting regulator in multiple tumor types. However, the exact role of TMEM88 in thyroid cancer is undetermined. The current study was designed to determine the expression, function, and potential underlying mechanism of TMEM88 in thyroid cancer. Our data demonstrated low TMEM88 expression in thyroid cancer tissues. Decreased TMEM88 expression was also found in several thyroid cancer cell lines, and restoration of TMEM88 markedly suppressed the proliferation, colony formation, and invasive potential of thyroid cancer cells. On the contrary, TMEM88 depletion significantly accelerated the proliferation, colony formation, and invasion of thyroid cancer cells. Further experiments documented that TMEM88 overexpression markedly decreased the expression of the active form of β-catenin and inhibited the expression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling targets genes, such as c-myc and cyclin D1. Notably, reactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by transfecting a vector that expressed constitutively active β-catenin partially reversed the TMEM88-mediated suppressive effect on thyroid cancer cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, TMEM88 upregulation markedly retarded the tumor growth of thyroid cancer cells in vivo using xenograft models associated with downregulation of active β-catenin expression. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that TMEM88 overexpression impeded the proliferation and invasion of thyroid cancer cells through downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These data indicate a potential tumor-suppressive function of TMEM88 in thyroid cancer. Our study highlights a key role for TMEM88 in regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling during the progression of thyroid cancer and suggests that TMEM88 is an attractive anticancer target for thyroid cancer.

Abstract: Oxidative stress is a key pathological factor for diabetic renal fibrosis by activating TGF-β/Smad pathway in glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) to promote the synthesis of extracellular matrix such as fibronectin (FN). Nuclear factor-E2-related factor (Nrf2)- anti-oxidant response element (ARE) anti-oxidative pathway has crucial renoprotective effects, and inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Nrf2 delays diabetic renal fibrosis development. Ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X) has close relationship with oxidative stress and TGF-β/Smad pathway, but whether it regulate diabetic renal fibrosis remains unclarified. Here, we found that advanced glycation-end products (AGEs) dose- and time-dependently reduced the protein expression and deubiquitinase activity of USP9X in GMCs. USP9X overexpression attenuated AGEs-induced upregulation of FN, TGF-β1, and Collagen Ⅳ, three fibrosis-related marker proteins, in a deubiquitinase activity-dependent manner. While USP9X depletion with siRNAs further promoted the expressions of those proteins in AGEs-treated GMCs. Under AGEs treatment conditions, USP9X overexpression markedly increased the total and nuclear levels, ARE-binding ability, and transcriptional activity of Nrf2, upregulated the protein expressions of Nrf2 downstream genes HO-1 and NQO1, and eventually reduced the excessive production of ROS. Overexpression of the deubiquitinase catalytically inactive USP9X–C1556S mutant failed to exert such effects. Silencing Nrf2 abolished the renoprotective effects of USP9X. Further study showed that upon AGEs stimulation, Nrf2 transferred into the nucleus and the interaction between USP9X and Nrf2 was weakened. AGEs also increased Nrf2 ubiquitination level, and overexpression of USP9X, instead of USP9X–C1556S, significantly reduced the ubiquitination level of Nrf2. Taken together, USP9X reduced Nrf2 ubiquitination level and promoted Nrf2-ARE pathway activation to prevent the accumulation of extracellular matrix, eventually alleviated the pathological process of diabetic renal fibrosis.

Abstract: The roles and therapeutic potential of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have attracted increased attention. However, many lncRNAs have not been annotated in AML, and their predictive value for AML therapy remains unclear. In this study, we identified a novel large intergenic noncoding RNA uc002jit.1 (D43770) from a lncRNA microarray. We first proved uc002jit.1 is a target gene of nuclear factor kappa B/RELA, RELA regulated uc002jit.1 transcription by binding to its promoter. Additionally, uc002jit.1 knockdown impaired the stability of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) mRNA, and then reduced PARP1 protein content and PARylation level upon DNA damage, thus inhibiting DNA damage repair in AML cells. Moreover, uc002jit.1 knockdown significantly inhibited AML cells proliferation and increased the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro as well as in a mouse model in vivo. Overall, our study indicated that uc002jit.1 may be associated with the occurrence and prognosis of AML and could be a new diagnostic/prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for AML.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that spindle and kinetochore-associated protein 2 (SKA2) is dysregulated in multiple tumors and acts as a key regulator of tumor progression. However, whether SKA2 plays a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to explore the expression, function and underlying molecular mechanism of SKA2 in HCC. We found that SKA2 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of SKA2 caused marked reductions in the proliferative, colony-forming and invasive capacities of HCC cells, while SKA2 overexpression had opposite effects. Further experiments revealed that overexpression of SKA2 enhanced expression levels of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and active β-catenin in HCC cells. Moreover, SKA3 overexpression enhanced transcriptional activity mediated by Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Knockdown of SKA3 downregulated the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and the effect was significantly reversed by the inhibition of GSK-3β. Notably, inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling markedly abrogated SKA2-mediated promotion effect on HCC proliferation and invasion. In addition, knockdown of SKA2 impeded tumor formation and growth in HCC cells in a nude mouse in vivo model. Overall, these findings indicate that SKA2 accelerates the progression of HCC through the upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Our study highlights a potential role of SKA2 in HCC progression and suggests it as a possible target for HCC treatment.

Abstract: Purpose
The role of microRNA (miR)-183 has been elucidated in systemic lupus erythematosus, while whether it is also engaged in the lupus nephritis (LN) development remains opaque. The intention of this study is to examine the relevance of miR-183 downregulation in the pathogenesis of LN.
Methods
The expression of miR-183 was first detected in MRL/lpr mice at weeks 8 and 12, followed by the assessment the effects of miR-183 on renal fibrosis and inflammatory response after overexpression or silencing of miR-183 in mice with LN. We further overexpressed or knocked-down miR-183 in human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs), and detected the expression patterns of inflammatory factors and Vimentin and α-SMA in the cells. Differentially expressed genes in HRGECs overexpressing miR-183 by microarrays were intersected with targeting mRNAs of miR-183 predicted by bioinformatics websites. The effects of transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (Tgfbr1) and TGF-β/Smad/TLR3 pathway on renal damage in mice were verified by rescue experiments.
Results
miR-183 expression was notably lower in MRL/lpr mice, and increased miR-183 expression inhibited renal fibrosis and inflammatory response in mice with LN. Moreover, miR-183 inhibitor in HRGECs remarkably promoted the expression of Vimentin and α-SMA and the secretion of inflammatory factors. miR-183 protected the mouse kidney from pathological damages by targeting and inhibiting Tgfbr1 expression.
Conclusion
miR-183 inhibited the expression of Tgfbr1 by direct targeting to disrupt the TGF-β/Smad/TLR3 pathway, thus repressing renal fibrosis and the secretion of inflammatory factors in LN.

Abstract: F-box and WD repeat domain–containing 7 (FBXW7) is an E3-ubiquitin ligase, which serves as one of the components of the SKP1, CUL1, and F-box protein type ubiquitin ligase (SCF) complex. Previous studies reveal that FBXW7 participates in cancer, inflammation and Parkinson's disease. FBXW7 also contributes to angiogenesis of endothelial cells. However, the function of FBXW7 in cardiac homeostasis remains to elucidate. Here we identified the critical role of FBXW7 during cardiac hypertrophy in humans and rodents. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot revealed that the mRNA and protein levels of FBXW7 were upregulated significantly in hypertrophic hearts in human and mouse as well as Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertrophic neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM). Gain-of-function (adenovirus) and loss-of-function (siRNA) experiments provided evidence that FBXW7 promoted Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy as demonstrated by the increase in the size of cardiomyocytes and overexpression of hypertrophic fetal genes myosin heavy chain 7 (Myh7) natriuretic peptide a (Nppa), brain natriuretic peptide (Nppb). Further mechanism study revealed that FBXW7 promoted the expression of sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1) in cardiomyocytes, which relied on regulation of the stability of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 (Enhancer of zeste homolog 2). Previous work revealed the pro-hypertrophic role of the EZH2-SIX1 axis in rodents. Indeed, our genetic and pharmacological evidence showed that the EZH2-SIX1 signaling was critically involved in FBXW7 functions in Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Therefore, we identified FBWX7 as an important regulator of cardiac hypertrophy via modulating the EZH2-SIX1 axis.

Abstract: Ebola virus (EBOV) infection is a widespread infection that has created a bad memory in Africa. In the 2014 and 2015 outbreak, more than 28,000 infections were reported by the World Health Organization, with about 11,300 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Heat shock protein A5 (HSPA5), termed also GRP78, is a host cell chaperone protein responsible for the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum. Under stress, HSPA5 is upregulated and becomes cell-surface exposed. Recent studies report the association of cell-surface HSPA5 with EBOV glycoproteins GP1 and GP2. In this study, structural and sequence analysis and molecular docking are used to predict the possible binding site between the cell-surface HSPA5 and EBOV GP1. The results show a promising binding site that supports the hypothesis of HSPA5 selectivity for binding to a specific peptide sequence (pep42). This study paves the way to suggest possible inhibitors to stop viral association with cell-surface receptors and subsequently reduce viral infection.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common, complex, and heterogeneous hematological malignancies in adults. Despite progresses in understanding the pathology of AML, the 5-year survival rates still remain low compared with CML, CLL, etc. The relationship between genomic features and drug responses is critical for precision medication. Herein, we depicted a picture for response of 145 drugs against 33 primary cell samples derived from AML patients with full spectrum of genomic features assessed by whole exon sequencing and RNA sequencing. In general, most of the samples were much more sensitive to the combinatorial chemotherapy regimens than the single chemotherapy drugs. Overall, these samples were moderately sensitive to the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and the targeted drugs. In the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), the TCM and targeted therapies displayed similar genetic signatures in the gene module correlation. Meanwhile, the expression of miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs did not display apparent gene module correlations among those different types of therapies. In addition, the combinatorial chemotherapy bear more module correlations than the single drugs. Interestingly, we found that the gene mutations and drug response were not enriched in any WGCNA module analysis. Most of the sensitive drug response biomarkers were enriched in the ribosome, endocytosis, cell cycle, and p53 associated signaling pathways. This study showed that gene expression modules might show better correlation than gene mutations for drug efficacy predictions.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family are abundant, obligate anaerobic members of the microbiota in healthy humans. Lachnospiraceae impact their hosts by producing short-chain fatty acids, converting primary to secondary bile acids, and facilitating colonization resistance against intestinal pathogens. To increase our understanding of genomic and functional diversity between members of this family, we cultured 273 Lachnospiraceae isolates representing 11 genera and 27 species from human donors and performed whole-genome sequencing assembly and annotation. This analysis revealed substantial inter- and intra-species diversity in pathways that likely influence an isolate’s ability to impact host health. These differences are likely to impact colonization resistance through lantibiotic expression or intestinal acidification, influence host mucosal immune cells and enterocytes via butyrate production, or contribute to synergism within a consortium by heterogenous polysaccharide metabolism. Identification of these specific functions could facilitate development of probiotic bacterial consortia that drive and/or restore in vivo microbiome functions.

Abstract: Summary
Studies of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) development from pre-HSC-producing hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) are hampered by the rarity of these cells and the presence of other cell types with overlapping marker expression profiles. We generated a Tg(Runx1-mKO2; Ly6a-GFP) dual reporter mouse to visualize hematopoietic commitment and study pre-HSC emergence and maturation. Runx1-mKO2 marked all intra-arterial HECs and hematopoietic cluster cells (HCCs), including pre-HSCs, myeloid- and lymphoid progenitors, and HSCs themselves. However, HSC and lymphoid potential were almost exclusively found in reporter double-positive (DP) cells. Robust HSC activity was first detected in DP cells of the placenta, reflecting the importance of this niche for (pre-)HSC maturation and expansion before the fetal liver stage. A time course analysis by single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that as pre-HSCs mature into fetal liver stage HSCs, they show signs of interferon exposure, exhibit signatures of multi-lineage differentiation gene expression, and develop a prolonged cell cycle reminiscent of quiescent adult HSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Several pathogens suppress exfoliation, a key defense of epithelia against microbial colonization. Common among these pathogens, exemplified by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, is their ability to bind carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs). Gonococcal CEACAM engagement triggers the expression of CD105, which is necessary to block epithelial exfoliation, whereas homotypic CEACAM-CEACAM interactions or antibody-mediated CEACAM clustering does not lead to CD105 expression. Here, we show that CEACAM-associated bacteria release nitric oxide (NO) during anaerobic respiration, and membrane-permeable NO initiates a eukaryotic signaling pathway involving soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), protein kinase G, and the transcription factor CREB to upregulate CD105 expression. A murine vaginal infection model with N. gonorrhoeae reveals this metabolic cross communication allows bacterial suppression of epithelial exfoliation to facilitate mucosal colonization. Disrupting NO-initiated responses in host cells re-establishes epithelial exfoliation and inhibits mouse genital tract colonization by N. gonorrhoeae, suggesting a host-directed approach to prevent bacterial infections.

Abstract: We evaluated the synergistic effects of pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in an interstitial cystitis (IC) rat model. After generation of the IC rat model, the rats were divided into 4 groups according to the treatment they received: phosphate-buffered saline injection into bladder submucosa, daily oral PPS feeding, MSC injection into bladder submucosa, or MSC injection into bladder submucosa with daily oral PPS feeding. After treatment, conscious cystometry and pain scale measurement were performed and their bladders were obtained for histological and proinflammatory-related gene expression analysis. On cystometric analysis, all treatment groups showed significantly increased intercontraction intervals and lower pain scores compared to those of the control group. Histological analysis revealed regenerated urothelium, less fibrosis, and decreased mast cell infiltration in all treatment groups compared to the control group. Significantly lower expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, MCP, IL-6, TLR2, and TLR11 was observed in the PPS with MSC group compared to the other groups. Combination therapy with PPS and MSCs showed histological and functional effects in an IC rat model, including synergistic effects leading to increased intercontraction interval and decreased inflammatory reactions.

Abstract: Regulating proteasome activity is a potent therapeutic aspect of age-related hearing loss, which has been proven to protect neurons from age-related damaging. PSMD11, subunit of the 19S proteasome regulatory particle, is known to mainly up-regulate proteasome activity and prolong aging. However, the mechanism of PSMD11 in age-related hearing loss has not been deeply explored. In the present study, we explore the function and mechanism of PSMD11 protecting neurons in d-Galactose (D-Gal) mimetic aging models. Age-related pathologies were detected by Taq-PCR, ABR, Transmission electron microscopy, toluidine blue and β-galactosidase staining. The relative expressions of the proteins were explored by Western blotting, oxyblot, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. Flow cytometry was used to manifest the oxidative state. We discovered that proteasome activity was impaired with aging, and that ROS and toxic protein accumulated in D-Gal induced aging models. PSMD11 changed with aging, and was associated with the metabolism of proteasome activity in the D-Gal treated models. Moreover, the knockdown or overexpression of PSMD11 was sufficient to change the oxidative state caused by D-Gal. Our results also demonstrated that PSMD11 could bond to AMPKα1/2 in the auditory cortex and PC12 cells, and AMPKα2 but not AMPKα1 was efficient to regulate the function of PSMD11. Deeper insights into the mechanisms of regulating PSMD11 for the anti-aging process are needed, and may offer novel therapeutic methods for central presbycusis.

Abstract: Summary
The ten-eleven translocation factor TET1 and its conferred epigenetic modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) have important roles in maintaining the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We previously showed that TET1 is also essential to maintain the stem cell state of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). Here, we establish an integrated panel of absolute 5hmC levels, genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns, transcriptomes, and TET1 chromatin occupancy in TSCs and differentiated trophoblast cells. We show that the combined presence of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5hmC correlates with transcriptional activity of associated genes. Hypoxia can slow down the global loss of 5hmC that occurs upon differentiation of TSCs. Notably, unlike in ESCs and epiblast cells, most TET1-bound regions overlap with active chromatin marks and TFAP2C binding sites and demarcate putative trophoblast enhancer regions. These chromatin modification and occupancy patterns are highly informative to identify novel candidate regulators of the TSC state.

Abstract: Objective
To explore the effects of breast cancer (BC)-derived exosomes on invasion and migration of BC cells.
Methods
Exosomes (Exo-MA, Exo-M7, Exo-M1) were extracted from normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A), BC cells (MCF-7/MDA-MB-231) and BC cells with miR-146a overexpression or knockdown using multi-step differential centrifugation. Morphologies and sizes of exosomes were observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and particle size analysis respectively. BC mouse models were injected with DIR labeled Exo-MA, Exo-M7 or Exo-M1. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BC cells was determined by PCR and Western blot. PKH67 labeled Exo-MA, Exo-M7 and Exo-M1 were incubated with NFs or MCF-7 to measure the activation of CAFs. Cell invasion and migration abilities were determined by scratch test and Transwell assay.
Results
Exo-MA, Exo-M7, Exo-M1 were successfully extracted with positive expressions of Alix, CD63 and TSG101. Contents of Ki67, N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail-1 were increased but E-cadherin was decreased, compared to Exo-MA group. Exo-M7 or Exo-M1 could increase BC cell proliferation and enhance EMT in nude mouse. Exo-M7 and Exo-M1 could accelerate the transformation of NFs into CAFs and promote the recruitment of CAFs in MCF-7. Transfection of miR-146a could promote the transformation of NFs into CAFs and promote cell invasion and migration of MCF-7 cells. As a target gene of miR-146a, TXNIP could inhibit the activation of CAFs. miR-146a overexpression or TXNIP silence enhance the activation of Wnt signal pathway.
Conclusion
BC-derived exosomes promote the activation of CAFs through miR-146a/TXNIP axis to activate Wnt pathway, which in turn enhances invasion and metastasis of BC cells.

Abstract: Summary
The BCL-2 family is composed of anti- and pro-apoptotic members that respectively protect or disrupt mitochondrial integrity. Anti-apoptotic overexpression can promote oncogenesis by trapping the BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) “killer domains” of pro-apoptotic proteins in a surface groove, blocking apoptosis. Groove inhibitors, such as the relatively large BCL-2 drug venetoclax (868 Da), have emerged as cancer therapies. BFL-1 remains an undrugged oncogenic protein and can cause venetoclax resistance. Having identified a unique C55 residue in the BFL-1 groove, we performed a disulfide tethering screen to determine if C55 reactivity could enable smaller molecules to block BFL-1's BH3-binding functionality. We found that a disulfide-bearing N-acetyltryptophan analog (304 Da adduct) effectively targeted BFL-1 C55 and reversed BFL-1-mediated suppression of mitochondrial apoptosis. Structural analyses implicated the conserved leucine-binding pocket of BFL-1 as the interaction site, resulting in conformational remodeling. Thus, therapeutic targeting of BFL-1 may be achievable through the design of small, cysteine-reactive drugs.

Abstract: Purpose
Owing to the late diagnosis and frequent metastasis, ovarian cancer (OC) exhibits a high mortality rate. The study was intended to figure out the function of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HCP5 in OC metastasis.
Methods
Microarray analysis was conducted to probe aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in OC tissues. Artificial silencing of lncRNA HCP5 was introduced in OC cells to identify its role in cell viability, invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The potential downstream targets of lncRNA HCP5 were predicted by bio-information system and validated through dual luciferase reporter gene assays. Silencing of microRNA-525–5p (miR-525–5p) was introduced in cells to probe its role in cell behaviors. Xenograft tumors were induced in nude mice for in vivo experiments.
Results
High expression of lncRNA HCP5 was found in OC tissues and cells. Silencing of lncRNA HCP5 led to a decrease in cell proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT process. LncRNA HCP5 is mainly sub-localized in cytoplasm. LncRNA HCP5 could act as a sponge for miR-525–5p, which could further bind to polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). Knockdown of miR-525–5p partly recovered the biological behaviors of OC cells inhibited by HCP5 silencing. In addition, HCP5 promoted Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activity. Silencing of lncRNA HCP5 also impeded growth and metastasis of tumor in mice.
Conclusion
The study suggested that lncRNA HCP5 might promote malignant behaviors of OC cells through the miR-525–5p/PRC1 crosstalk and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Silencing of HCP5 might serve as a novel option for OC treatment.

Abstract: Safe and efficient intracellular delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 is a key step for effective therapeutic genome editing in a wide range of diseases. This remains challenging due to multiple drawbacks of the currently available vehicles. Here we report that epithelial cell -derived microvesicles (MVs) function as safe and natural carriers for efficient delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 to treat cancer. In our study, compared to epithelial cell -derived MVs, cancer -derived MVs were quickly absorbed intracellularly by recipient cancer cells in vitro and showed selective accumulation in tumors of HepG2 xenografts in vivo, due to their cancer cell tropism dependent targeting. Surprisingly, synergistic anti-tumor effect of sgIQ 1.1 loaded Cas9MVs/HEK293 + sorafenib was better than sgIQ 1.1 + Cas9MVs/HepG2 + sorafenib in vitro. In addition, qPCR results showed that miR-21 and miR-181a expression were upregulated in HepG2 cells treated with cancer cell -derived MVs that might support the cancer progression. Further, treatment of HepG2 xenografts with sgIQ 1.1 loaded Cas9MVs/HEK293 showed enhanced anti-cancer effect than sgIQ 1.1 + Cas9MVs/HepG2. Therefore, we conclude that normal cells -derived MVs can act as better and safe natural delivery systems for cancer therapeutics in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Trypanosomiasis is a devastating neglected tropical disease affecting livestock and humans. Humans are susceptible to two Trypanosoma brucei subspecies but protected from other trypanosomes by circulating high-density lipoprotein (HDL) complexes called trypanosome lytic factors (TLFs) 1 and 2. TLFs contain apolipoprotein L-1 contributing to lysis and haptoglobin-related protein (HPR), which can function as a ligand for a parasite receptor. TLF2 also uniquely contains non-covalently associated immunoglobin M (IgM) antibodies, the role and origin of which remain unclear. Here, we show that these TLF2-associated IgMs interact with both HPR and alternate trypanosome surface proteins, including variant surface glycoprotein, likely facilitating complex biogenesis and TLF uptake into parasites. TLF2-IgMs are germline antibodies that, while present at basal concentrations in healthy individuals, are elicited by trypanosome infection in both murine models and human sleeping sickness patients. These data suggest that poly- and self-reactive germline antibodies such as TLF2-associated IgMs play a role in antimicrobial immunity.

Abstract: Summary
Studies of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have led to the identification of mutations that affect different cellular pathways. Some of these have been classified as preleukemic, and a stepwise evolution program whereby cells acquire additional mutations has been proposed in the development of AML. How the timing of acquisition of these mutations and their impact on transformation and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment occurs has only recently begun to be investigated. We show that constitutive and early loss of the epigenetic regulator, TET2, when combined with constitutive activation of FLT3, results in transformation of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-like or myeloproliferative neoplasm-like phenotype to AML, which is more pronounced in double-mutant mice relative to mice carrying mutations in single genes. Furthermore, we show that in preleukemic and leukemic mice there are alterations in the BM niche and secreted cytokines, which creates a permissive environment for the growth of mutation-bearing cells relative to normal cells.

Abstract: Summary
TDP-43 dysfunction is common to 97% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases, including those with mutations in C9orf72. To investigate how C9ORF72 mutations drive cellular pathology in ALS and to identify convergent mechanisms between C9ORF72 and TARDBP mutations, we analyzed motor neurons (MNs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with ALS. C9ORF72 iPSC-MNs have higher Ca2+ release after depolarization, delayed recovery to baseline after glutamate stimulation, and lower levels of calbindin compared with CRISPR/Cas9 genome-edited controls. TARDBP iPS-derived MNs show high glutamate-induced Ca2+ release. We identify here, by RNA sequencing, that both C9ORF72 and TARDBP iPSC-MNs have upregulation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA and NMDA subunits and impairment of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering due to an imbalance of MICU1 and MICU2 on the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, indicating that impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake contributes to glutamate excitotoxicity and is a shared feature of MNs with C9ORF72 or TARDBP mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Initial enteropathogen growth in the microbiota-colonized gut is poorly understood. Salmonella Typhimurium is metabolically adaptable and can harvest energy by anaerobic respiration using microbiota-derived hydrogen (H2) as an electron donor and fumarate as an electron acceptor. As fumarate is scarce in the gut, the source of this electron acceptor is unclear. Here, transposon sequencing analysis along the colonization trajectory of S. Typhimurium implicates the C4-dicarboxylate antiporter DcuABC in early murine gut colonization. In competitive colonization assays, DcuABC and enzymes that convert the C4-dicarboxylates aspartate and malate into fumarate (AspA, FumABC), are required for fumarate/H2-dependent initial growth. Thus, S. Typhimurium obtains fumarate by DcuABC-mediated import and conversion of L-malate and L-aspartate. Fumarate reduction yields succinate, which is exported by DcuABC in exchange for L-aspartate and L-malate. This cycle allows S. Typhimurium to harvest energy by H2/fumarate respiration in the microbiota-colonized gut. This strategy may also be relevant for commensal E. coli diminishing the S. Typhimurium infection.

Abstract: Summary
The live-attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV or Sabin vaccine) replicates in gut-associated tissues, eliciting mucosa and systemic immunity. OPV protects from disease and limits poliovirus spread. Accordingly, vaccination with OPV is the primary strategy used to end the circulation of all polioviruses. However, the ability of OPV to regain replication fitness and establish new epidemics represents a significant risk of polio re-emergence should immunization cease. Here, we report the development of a poliovirus type 2 vaccine strain (nOPV2) that is genetically more stable and less likely to regain virulence than the original Sabin2 strain. We introduced modifications within at the 5′ untranslated region of the Sabin2 genome to stabilize attenuation determinants, 2C coding region to prevent recombination, and 3D polymerase to limit viral adaptability. Prior work established that nOPV2 is immunogenic in preclinical and clinical studies, and thus may enable complete poliovirus eradication.

Abstract: The Igfn1 gene produces multiple proteins by alternative splicing predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. Igfn1 deficient clones derived from C2C12 myoblasts show reduced fusion index and morphological differences compared to control myotubes. Here, we first show that G:F actin ratios are significantly higher in differentiating IGFN1-deficient C2C12 myoblasts, suggesting that fusion and differentiation defects are underpinned by deficient actin remodelling. We obtained pull-downs from skeletal muscle with IGFN1 fragments and applied a proteomics approach. The proteomic composition of IGFN1 complexes identified the cytoskeleton and an association with the proteasome as the main networks. The actin nucleating protein COBL was selected for further validation. COBL is expressed in C2C12 myoblasts from the first stages of myoblast fusion but not in proliferating cells. COBL is also expressed in adult muscle and, as IGFN1, localizes to the Z-disc. We show that IGFN1 interacts, stabilizes and colocalizes with COBL and prevents the ability of COBL to form actin ruffles in COS7 cells. COBL loss of function C2C12-derived clones are able to fuse, therefore indicating that COBL or the IGFN1/COBL interaction are not essential for myoblast fusion.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence indicates that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in endometrial cancer (EC) pathogenesis. The present study investigated the clinical significance and biological function of extracellular vesicle (EV) encapsulated miR-320a released from CAFs in EC. EC-related microarray data was obtained from the GSE25405 database and differential analysis was performed. Expression of miR-320a in CAFs and normal endometrial fibroblasts (NFs) as well as CAF-delivered EVs was detected; also, delivery of miR-320a from CAFs to EC cells was observed. In addition we confirmed that miR-320a targets HIF1α via a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Phenotypic analysis was used to study the functional significance of EV delivered miR-320a and its downstream effects. miR-320a was found to have low expression in EC cells and tissues. CAF-secreted EVs were successfully isolated and miR-320a was found also be expressed at low levels in these EVs. Finally, we found direct transfer of CAF-secreted exosomal miR-320a to EC cells, which inhibited their proliferation. Mechanistically, we found this is due to downregulation of HIF1α by miR-320a, which led to lowered VEGFA expression in vitro. Accordingly, we overexpressed HIF1α also showed that the inhibitory effect of miR-320a overexpression in EC cells could be reversed. These results point to CAF-derived EVs carrying overexpressed miR-320a as a novel direction for therapeutic strategies for EC.

Abstract: Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) have been implicated in the development of various cancers. PRMT2, a member of the type I PRMT family, is overexpressed in multiple tumors. However, the expression and role of PRMT2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been studied. Here, we discovered that PRMT2 expression is elevated in HCC tissues compared to the corresponding non-tumor tissues, and PRMT2 overexpression is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients. Depletion of PRMT2 in HCC cell lines inhibited their cell growth and induced apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations showed that PRMT2 is responsible for H3R8 asymmetric methylation (H3R8me2a). H3R8me2a enrichment at the Bcl2 promoter increases its accessibility to STAT3, promoting Bcl2 gene expression. In addition, our results confirmed that the catalytically inactive mutant of PRMT2 or the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 impaired the pro-tumorigenic functions of PRMT2 in HCC cells. Overall, our findings showed that PRMT2 functions as an oncogenic gene in HCC, revealing its potential as a novel therapeutic target in HCC.

Abstract: Summary
With more than 450 members, the solute carrier (SLC) group of proteins represents the largest class of transporters encoded in the human genome. Their several-pass transmembrane domain structure and hydrophobicity contribute to the orphan status of many SLCs, devoid of known cargos or chemical inhibitors. We report that SLC proteins belonging to different families and subcellular compartments are amenable to induced degradation by heterobifunctional ligands. Engineering endogenous alleles via the degradation tag (dTAG) technology enabled chemical control of abundance of the transporter protein, SLC38A2. Moreover, we report the design of d9A-2, a chimeric compound engaging several members of the SLC9 family and leading to their degradation. d9A-2 impairs cellular pH homeostasis and promotes cell death in a range of cancer cell lines. These findings open the era of SLC-targeting chimeric degraders and demonstrate potential access of multi-pass transmembrane proteins of different subcellular localizations to the chemically exploitable degradation machinery.

Abstract: Prolonged cardiac hypertrophy, a pathological compensatory response of the heart, finally leads to heart failure. Numerous studies have illustrated the vital roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we probed into the role and probable mechanism of microRNA-30e-5p (miR-30e-5p) in Angiotensin II (Ang–II)–stimulated hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Intriguingly, the expression of hypertrophic markers, cell surface area and protein/DNA ratio were all reduced in Ang–II–induced hypertrophic cardiomyocytes when miR-30e-5p expression was augmented. Then, ADAM9 was screened out as the target of miR-30e-5p and ADAM9 overexpression rescued the effect of miR-30e-5p upregulation in Ang–II–treated cardiomyocytes. Moreover, we identified Kcnq1ot1 as the upstream of miR-30e-5p/ADAM9 axis and verified that Kcnq1ot1 aggrandized ADAM9 expression in Ang–II–treated cardiomyocytes through absorbing miR-30e-5p. Furthermore, rescue assays confirmed that ADAM9 up-regulation abrogated the repressive effect of Kcnq1ot1 depletion on Ang–II–induced cardiac hypertrophy. In conclusion, Kcnq1ot1 sequestered miR-30e-5p to release ADAM9 to facilitate cardiac hypertrophy, indicating that Kcnq1ot1 might be used as a potentially therapeutic target for cardiac hypertrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Pericytes (PCs) have been reported to contribute to the mechanoregulation of the capillary diameter and blood flow in health and disease. How this is realized remains poorly understood. We designed several models representing basement membrane (BM) in between PCs and endothelial cells (ECs). These models captured a unique protein organization with micron-sized FN patches surrounded by laminin (LM) and allowed to obtain quantitative information on PC morphology and contractility. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived PCs, we could address mechanical aspects of mid-capillary PC behavior in vitro. Our results showed that PCs strongly prefer FN patches over LM for adhesion formation, have an optimal stiffness for spreading in the range of EC rigidity, and react in a non-canonical way with increased traction forces and reduced spreading on other stiffness then the optimal. Our approach opens possibilities to further study PC force regulation under well-controlled conditions.

Abstract: Objectives
Cisplatin is commonly applied as anticancer agent for various cancers, including ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, the drug resistance frequently occurred which obstructing the effect of cisplatin on tumors. The goal of our research was to investigate the reversal actions and the potential mechanisms of sulforaphane (SFN) on cisplatin resistance in ovarian carcinoma.
Methods
The A2780 and IGROV1 cells and their cisplatin resistance cells A2780/CP70 and IGROV1-R10 were used in this study. Cell viability was detected by CCK-8. The DNA repair was measured by comet assay. The cisplatin transporter proteins were measured with western blotting. The concentration of intracellular cisplatin was detected by HPLC. The luciferase activity assay was applied to determine the target site of miR-30a-3p on the 3′UTR of ERCC1 and ATP7A. A2780/CP70 and IGROV1-R10 xenograft mouse model were established to confirm the antineoplastic action of SFN combined with cisplatin.
Results
SFN reversed the resistance of A2780/CP70 and IGROV1-R10 ovarian carcinoma cells to cisplatin through inducing DNA damage and accumulation of intracellular cisplatin. SFN treatment notably increased miR-30a-3p expression, which was decreased in cisplatin-resistant cells. Moreover, overexpressed miR-30a-3p enhanced the sensitivity of A2780/CP70 and IGROV1-R10 cells to cisplatin treatment, and inhibiting miR-30a-3p activity abated the reversal actions of SFN on cisplatin resistance. The luciferase assay findings showed that miR-30a-3p binds to ERCC1 and ATP7A which are the key regulators for DNA repair and cisplatin transportation.
Conclusions
Our findings indicated that SFN could enhance cisplatin sensitivity of ovarian carcinoma cells through up-regulating miR-30a-3p to induce DNA damage and accumulation of intracellular cisplatin.

Abstract: Postmenopausal osteoporosis is very common in women. Currently, many kinds of new drugs are being developed for this disease. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is closely related to overactivity of osteoclasts in body. Shikonin is purple red naphthoquinone pigment extracted from lithospermum, which has anti-inflammation, antivirus, anticancer and other bioactivities. At the same time, it has been proved that shikonin can promote the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, but its influence on osteoclasts and molecular mechanism are unknown. Our study showed that shikonin could inhibit the activity and formation of RANKL-mediated osteoclasts depending on dose without affecting the activity of bone marrow macrophages (BMM). In addition, we have also found that shikonin can inhibit the expression of specific marker gene of osteoclasts, including nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), cathepsin K (Ctsk), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAcP) and calcitonin receptor. Shikonin also could promote the proliferation of MC3T3-E1, increasing the expression of mRNA related to osteogenesis, like the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteocalcin (OCN). Luciferase reporter gene assay and Western blot analysis further indicated that shikonin could inhibit the activity of RANKL-induced NF-κB and NFAT receptors. Moreover, shikonin can also slow down bone loss of ovariectomized (OVX) mice by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts. This work explains the molecular mechanism of shikonin in RANKL-mediated formation of osteoclasts, and reveals the potential of further developing shikonin into a new drug for prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Abstract: Summary
Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to establish an imaging-based, semi-automatic, high-throughput system for the quantitative detection of disease-specific phenotypes in dopaminergic neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with familial PD having Parkin or PINK1 mutations, which exhibit abnormal mitochondrial homeostasis. The proposed system recapitulates the deficiency of mitochondrial clearance, ROS accumulation, and increasing apoptosis in these familial PD-derived neurons. We screened 320 compounds for their ability to ameliorate multiple phenotypes and identified four candidate drugs. Some of these drugs improved the locomotion defects and reduced ATP production caused by PINK1 inactivation in Drosophila and were effective for idiopathic PD-derived neurons with impaired mitochondrial clearance. Our findings suggest that the proposed high-throughput system has potential for identifying effective drugs for familial and idiopathic PD.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of inflammation is hypothesized to play a crucial role in the severe complications of COVID-19, with the IL-1/IL-6 pathway being central. Here, we report on the treatment of eight severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients—seven hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) in Greece and one non-ICU patient in the Netherlands—with the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra. All patients scored positive for the hemophagocytosis score (HScore) and were diagnosed with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH) characterized by pancytopenia, hyper-coagulation, acute kidney injury, and hepatobiliary dysfunction. At the end of treatment, ICU patients had less need for vasopressors, significantly improved respiratory function, and lower HScore. Although three patients died, the mortality was lower than historical series of patients with sHLH in sepsis. These data suggest that administration of Anakinra may be beneficial for treating severe COVID-19 patients with sHLH as determined by the HScore, and they support the need for larger clinical studies to validate this concept.

Abstract: Summary
Two genetic diseases, Gorlin syndrome and McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS), show completely opposite symptoms in terms of bone mineral density and hedgehog (Hh) activity. In this study, we utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based models of the two diseases to understand the roles of Hh signaling in osteogenesis. Gorlin syndrome-derived iPSCs showed increased osteoblastogenesis and mineralization with Hh signaling activation and upregulation of a set of transcription factors in an osteogenic culture, compared with the isogenic control. MAS-specific iPSCs showed poor mineralization with low Hh signaling activity in the osteogenic culture; impaired osteoblastogenesis was restored to the normal level by treatment with an Hh signaling-activating small molecule. These data suggest that Hh signaling is a key controller for differentiation of osteoblasts from precursors. This study may pave a path to new drug therapies for genetic abnormalities in calcification caused by dysregulation of Hh signaling.
