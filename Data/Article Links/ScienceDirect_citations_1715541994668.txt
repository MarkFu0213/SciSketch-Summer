Abstract: Summary
Glycogen is the major mammalian glucose storage cache and is critical for energy homeostasis. Glycogen synthesis in neurons must be tightly controlled due to neuronal sensitivity to perturbations in glycogen metabolism. Lafora disease (LD) is a fatal, congenital, neurodegenerative epilepsy. Mutations in the gene encoding the glycogen phosphatase laforin result in hyperphosphorylated glycogen that forms water-insoluble inclusions called Lafora bodies (LBs). LBs induce neuronal apoptosis and are the causative agent of LD. The mechanism of glycogen dephosphorylation by laforin and dysfunction in LD is unknown. We report the crystal structure of laforin bound to phosphoglucan product, revealing its unique integrated tertiary and quaternary structure. Structure-guided mutagenesis combined with biophysical and biochemical analyses reveal the basis for normal function of laforin in glycogen metabolism. Analyses of LD patient mutations define the mechanism by which subsets of mutations disrupt laforin function. These data provide fundamental insights connecting glycogen metabolism to neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: This study compared resting and exercise heat/hypoxic stress-induced levels of plasma extracellular heat shock protein 70 (eHSP70) in humans using two commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIS)A kits. EDTA plasma samples were collected from 21 males during two separate investigations. Participants in part A completed a 60-min treadmill run in the heat (HOT70; 33.0±0.1 °C, 28.7±0.8 %, n = 6) at 70 % V̇O2max. Participants in part B completed 60 min of cycling exercise at 50 % V̇O2max in either hot (HOT50; 40.5 °C, 25.4 relative humidity (RH)%, n = 7) or hypoxic (HYP50; fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) = 0.14, 21 °C, 35 % RH, n = 8) conditions. Samples were collected prior to and immediately upon termination of exercise and analysed for eHSP70 using EKS-715 high-sensitivity HSP70 ELISA and new ENZ-KIT-101 Amp’d™ HSP70 high-sensitivity ELISA. ENZ-KIT was superior in detecting resting eHSP70 (1.54±3.27 ng·mL−1; range 0.08 to 14.01 ng·mL−1), with concentrations obtained from 100 % of samples compared to 19 % with EKS-715 assay. The ENZ-KIT requires optimisation prior to running samples in order to ensure participants fall within the standard curve, a step not required with EKS-715. Using ENZ-KIT, a 1:4 dilution allowed for quantification of resting HSP70 in 26/32 samples, with a 1:8 (n = 3) and 1:16 (n = 3) dilution required to determine the remaining samples. After exercise, eHSP70 was detected in 6/21 and 21/21 samples using EKS-715 and ENZ-KIT, respectively. eHSP70 was increased from rest after HOT70 (p < 0.05), but not HOT50 (p > 0.05) or HYP50 (p > 0.05) when analysed using ENZ-KIT. It is recommended that future studies requiring the precise determination of resting plasma eHSP70 use the ENZ-KIT (i.e. HSP70 Amp’d® ELISA) instead of the EKS-715 assay, despite additional assay development time and cost required.

Abstract: Histone deacetylases (HDAC) which play a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation are promising drug targets. However, HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) modelled on natural hydroxamic acids such as trichostatin A frequently lead to resistance or even an increased agressiveness of tumours. As a workaround we developed 4-(1-ethyl-4-anisyl-imidazol-5-yl)-N-hydroxycinnamide (etacrox), a hydroxamic acid that combines HDAC inhibition with synergistic effects of the 4,5-diarylimidazole residue. Etacrox proved highly cytotoxic against a panel of metastatic and resistant cancer cell lines while showing greater specificity for cancer over non-malignant cells when compared to the approved HDACi vorinostat. Like the latter, etacrox and the closely related imidazoles bimacroxam and animacroxam acted as pan-HDACi yet showed some specificity for HDAC6. Akt signalling and interference with nuclear beta-catenin localisation were elicited by etacrox at lower concentrations when compared to vorinostat. Moreover, etacrox disrupted the microtubule and focal adhesion dynamics of cancer cells and inhibited the proteolytic activity of prometastatic and proangiogenic matrix metalloproteinases. As a consequence, etacrox acted strongly antimigratory and antiinvasive against various cancer cell lines in three-dimensional transwell invasion assays and also antiangiogenic in vivo with respect to blood vessel formation in the chorioallantoic membrane assay. These pleiotropic effects and its water-solubility and tolerance by mice render etacrox a promising new HDACi candidate.

Abstract: Migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is an early event of atherosclerosis, which is mediated mainly by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 9. Because MMP13 is associated with tumor cells migration, we hypothesized that MMP13 participates in VSMC migration induced by certain stimuli such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and angiotensin II (Ang II). We found that the mRNA level of MMP13 in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RAoSMCs) was increased by both PDGF and Ang II. We observed the significant decrease of migration in PDGF- or Ang II-treated RAoSMCs by MMP13 specific inhibitor treatment. Silencing of MMP13 by a specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly decreased expression of the active form of MMP13, which is followed by the decreased migration of PDGF- or Ang II-treated RAoSMCs. Interestingly, we observed synergistic inhibitory effects on migration by treatment with MMP2 and 13 or MMP9 and 13 inhibitors compared with that in single treatments. Moreover, we found that cordycepin, a known inhibitor of VSMC migration, caused significant downregulation of MMP2, 9, and 13 expression in PDGF-treated RAoSMCs. We further show that the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was significantly decreased in LRP1-silenced cells, suggesting that ERK is a potential mediator of LRP1-regulated MMP2 and MMP9 expression in U87 cells. Together, our data strongly suggest that MMP13 involves VSMCs migration via an Akt and ERK-dependent regulation.

Abstract: Toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 9 transduce a cellular signal through the MyD88-dependent pathway and induce the production of inflammatory mediators against microbial nucleotide components. The repeated stimulation of TLR4 leads to endotoxin tolerance, but the molecular mechanisms of tolerance induced through the costimulation of individual TLR has not yet been established, although endosomal TLRs share signaling pathways with TLR4. In the present study, mouse macrophages were simultaneously stimulated with the TLR7 agonist, gardiquimod (GDQ), and the TLR9 agonist, CpG ODN 1826, to examine the mechanism and effector functions of macrophage tolerance. Compared with individual stimulation, the costimulation of both TLRs reduced the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 through the delayed activation of the NF-κB pathway; notably, IL-10 remained unchanged in costimulated macrophages. This tolerance reflected the early induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1), according to the detection of elevated TNF-α secretion and restored NF-κB signaling in response to the siRNA-mediated abrogation of SOCS-1 signaling. In addition, the restimulation of each TLRs using the same ligand significantly reduced the expression of both TLRs in endosomes. These findings revealed that the costimulation of TLR7 and TLR9 induced macrophage tolerance via SOCS-1, and the restimulation of each receptor or both TLR7 and TLR9 downregulated TLR expression through a negative feedback mechanisms that protects the host from excessive inflammatory responses. Moreover, the insufficient and impaired immune response in chronic viral infection might also reflect the repeated and simultaneous stimulation of those endosomal TLRs.

Abstract: Summary
A recent study has suggested that fibroblasts can be converted into mouse-induced neural stem cells (miNSCs) through the expression of defined factors. However, successful generation of human iNSCs (hiNSCs) has proven challenging to achieve. Here, using microRNA (miRNA) expression profile analyses, we showed that let-7 microRNA has critical roles for the formation of PAX6/NESTIN-positive colonies from human adult fibroblasts and the proliferation and self-renewal of hiNSCs. HMGA2, a let-7-targeting gene, enables induction of hiNSCs that displayed morphological/molecular features and in vitro/in vivo differentiation potential similar to H9-derived NSCs. Interestingly, HMGA2 facilitated the efficient conversion of senescent somatic cells or blood CD34+ cells into hiNSCs through an interaction with SOX2, whereas other combinations or SOX2 alone showed a limited conversion ability. Taken together, these findings suggest that HMGA2/let-7 facilitates direct reprogramming toward hiNSCs in minimal conditions and maintains hiNSC self-renewal, providing a strategy for the clinical treatment of neurological diseases.

Abstract: Due to their cardiac origin, H9c2 cells rank among the most popular cell lines in current cardiovascular research, yet molecular phenotype remains elusive. Hence, in this study we used proteomic approach to describe molecular phenotype of H9c2 cells in their undifferentiated (i.e., most frequently used) state, and its functional response to cardiotoxic drug doxorubicin. Of 1671 proteins identified by iTRAQ IEF/LC–MSMS analysis, only 12 proteins were characteristic for striated muscle cells and none was cardiac phenotype-specific. Targeted LC-SRM and western blot analyses confirmed that undifferentiated H9c2 cells are phenotypically considerably different to both primary neonatal cardiomyocytes and adult myocardium. These cells lack proteins essential for formation of striated muscle myofibrils or they express only minor amounts thereof. They also fail to express many proteins important for metabolism of muscle cells. The challenge with clinically relevant concentrations of doxorubicin did not induce a proteomic signature that has been previously noted in primary cardiomyocytes or adult hearts. Instead, several alterations previously described in other cells of mesodermal origin, such as fibroblasts, were observed (e.g., severe down-regulation of collagen synthesis pathway). In conclusion, the molecular phenotype of H9c2 cells resembles very immature myogenic cells with skeletal muscle commitment upon differentiation and thus, translatability of findings obtained in these cells deserves caution.

Abstract: Summary
Using a functional approach to investigate the epigenetics of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we combine three lines of evidence—diet-induced epigenetic dysregulation in mouse, epigenetic conservation in humans, and T2D clinical risk evidence—to identify genes implicated in T2D pathogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms related to obesity. Beginning with dietary manipulation of genetically homogeneous mice, we identify differentially DNA-methylated genomic regions. We then replicate these results in adipose samples from lean and obese patients pre- and post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, identifying regions where both the location and direction of methylation change are conserved. These regions overlap with 27 genetic T2D risk loci, only one of which was deemed significant by GWAS alone. Functional analysis of genes associated with these regions revealed four genes with roles in insulin resistance, demonstrating the potential general utility of this approach for complementing conventional human genetic studies by integrating cross-species epigenomics and clinical genetic risk.

Abstract: Striated skeletal muscle cells from humans represent a valuable source for in vitro studies of the motoric system as well as for pathophysiological investigations in the clinical settings. Myoblasts can readily be grown from human muscle tissue. However, if muscle tissue is unavailable, myogenic cells can be generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) preferably without genetic engineering. Our study aimed to optimize the generation of hiPSCs derived myogenic cells by employing selection of CD34 positive cells and followed by distinct, stepwise culture conditions. Following the expansion of CD34 positive single cells under myogenic cell culture conditions, serum deprived myoblast-like cells finally fused and formed multinucleated striated myotubes that expressed a set of key markers for muscle differentiation. In addition, these myotubes contracted upon electrical stimulation, responded to acetylcholine (Ach) and were able to generate action potentials. Finally, we co-cultured motoneurons and myotubes generated from identical hiPSCs cell lines. We could observe the early aggregation of acetylcholine receptors in muscle cells of immature co-cultures. At later stages, we identified and characterised mature neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). In summary, we describe here the successful generation of an iPS cell derived functional cellular system consisting of two distinct communicating cells types. This in vitro co-culture system could therefore contribute to research on diseases in which the motoneurons and the NMJ are predominantly affected, such as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal muscular atrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Chlamydia trachomatis is a leading cause of genital and ocular infections for which no vaccine exists. Upon entry into host cells, C. trachomatis resides within a membrane-bound compartment—the inclusion—and secretes inclusion membrane proteins (Incs) that are thought to modulate the host-bacterium interface. To expand our understanding of Inc function(s), we subjected putative C. trachomatis Incs to affinity purification-mass spectroscopy (AP-MS). We identified Inc-human interactions for 38/58 Incs with enrichment in host processes consistent with Chlamydia’s intracellular life cycle. There is significant overlap between Inc targets and viral proteins, suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms among obligate intracellular microbes. IncE binds to sorting nexins (SNXs) 5/6, components of the retromer, which relocalizes SNX5/6 to the inclusion membrane and augments inclusion membrane tubulation. Depletion of retromer components enhances progeny production, revealing that retromer restricts Chlamydia infection. This study demonstrates the value of proteomics in unveiling host-pathogen interactions in genetically challenging microbes.

Abstract: Summary
NF-κB is essential for effective transcription of primate lentiviral genomes and also activates antiviral host genes. Here, we show that the early protein Nef of most primate lentiviruses enhances NF-κB activation. In contrast, the late protein Vpu of HIV-1 and its simian precursors inhibits activation of NF-κB, even in the presence of Nef. Although this effect of Vpu did not correlate with its ability to interact with β-TrCP, it involved the stabilization of IκB and reduced nuclear translocation of p65. Interestingly, however, Vpu did not affect casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation of p65. Lack of Vpu was associated with increased NF-κB activation and induction of interferon and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in HIV-1-infected T cells. Thus, HIV-1 and its simian precursors employ Nef to boost NF-κB activation early during the viral life cycle to initiate proviral transcription, while Vpu is used to downmodulate NF-κB-dependent expression of ISGs at later stages.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor whose growth is driven by stem cell-like cells. BMP signaling triggers cell-cycle exit and differentiation of GBM stem cells (GSCs) and, therefore, might have therapeutic value. However, the epigenetic mechanisms that accompany differentiation remain poorly defined. It is also unclear whether cell-cycle arrest is terminal. Here we find only a subset of GSC cultures exhibit astrocyte differentiation in response to BMP. Although overtly differentiated non-cycling astrocytes are generated, they remain vulnerable to cell-cycle re-entry and fail to appropriately reconfigure DNA methylation patterns. Chromatin accessibility mapping identified loci that failed to alter in response to BMP and these were enriched in SOX transcription factor-binding motifs. SOX transcription factors, therefore, may limit differentiation commitment. A similar propensity for cell-cycle re-entry and de-differentiation was observed in GSC-derived oligodendrocyte-like cells. These findings highlight significant obstacles to BMP-induced differentiation as therapy for GBM.

Abstract: Understanding how to achieve efficient transduction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), while preserving their long-term ability to self-reproduce, is key for applying lentiviral-based gene engineering methods. SAMHD1 is an HIV-1 restriction factor in myeloid and resting CD4+ T cells that interferes with reverse transcription by decreasing the nucleotide pools or by its RNase activity. Here we show that SAMHD1 is expressed at high levels in HSPCs cultured in a medium enriched with cytokines. Thus, we hypothesized that degrading SAMHD1 in HSPCs would result in more efficient lentiviral transduction rates. We used viral like particles (VLPs) containing Vpx, shRNA against SAMHD1, or provided an excess of dNTPs or dNs to study this question. Regardless of the method applied, we saw no increase in the lentiviral transduction rate. The result was different when we used viruses (HR-GFP-Vpx+) which carry Vpx and encode GFP. These viruses allow assessment of the effects of Vpx specifically in the transduced cells. Using HR-GFP-Vpx+ viruses, we observed a modest but significant increase in the transduction efficiency. These data suggest that SAMHD1 has some limited efficacy in blocking reverse transcription but the major barrier for efficient lentiviral transduction occurs before reverse transcription.

Abstract: Summary
Precise self-renewal of the germ cell lineage is fundamental to fertility and reproductive success. The early precursors for the germ lineage, primordial germ cells (PGCs), survive and proliferate in several embryonic locations during their migration to the embryonic gonad. By elucidating the active signaling pathways in migratory PGCs in vivo, we were able to create culture conditions that recapitulate this embryonic germ cell environment. In defined medium conditions without feeder cells, the growth factors FGF2, insulin, and Activin A, signaling through their cognate-signaling pathways, were sufficient for self-renewal of germline-competent PGCs. Forced expression of constitutively active MEK1, AKT, and SMAD3 proteins could replace their respective upstream growth factors. Unexpectedly, we found that BMP4 could replace Activin A in non-clonal growth conditions. These defined medium conditions identify the key molecular pathways required for PGC self-renewal and will facilitate efforts in biobanking of chicken genetic resources and genome editing.

Abstract: Summary
The TET2 DNA dioxygenase regulates cell identity and suppresses tumorigenesis by modulating DNA methylation and expression of a large number of genes. How TET2, like most other chromatin-modifying enzymes, is recruited to specific genomic sites is unknown. Here we report that WT1, a sequence-specific transcription factor, is mutated in a mutually exclusive manner with TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). WT1 physically interacts with and recruits TET2 to its target genes to activate their expression. The interaction between WT1 and TET2 is disrupted by multiple AML-derived TET2 mutations. TET2 suppresses leukemia cell proliferation and colony formation in a manner dependent on WT1. These results provide a mechanism for targeting TET2 to a specific DNA sequence in the genome. Our results also provide an explanation for the mutual exclusivity of WT1 and TET2 mutations in AML, and suggest an IDH1/2-TET2-WT1 pathway in suppressing AML.

Abstract: TET proteins have been found to play an important role in active demethylation at CpG sites in mammals. There are some reports implicating their functions in removal of DNA methylation imprint at the imprinted regions in the germline. However, it is not well established whether TET proteins can also be involved in demethylation of DNA methylation imprint in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here we report that loss of TET proteins caused a significant increase in DNA methylation at the Igf2–H19 imprinted region in ES cells. We also observed a variable increase in DNA methylation at the Peg1 imprinted region in the ES clones devoid of TET proteins, in particular in the differentiated ES cells. By contrast, we did not observe a significant increase of DNA methylation imprint at the Peg3, Snrpn and Dlk1–Dio3 imprinted regions in ES cells lacking TET proteins. Interestingly, loss of TET proteins did not result in a significant increase of DNA methylation imprint at the Igf2–H19 and Peg1 imprinted regions in the embryoid bodies (EB). Therefore, TET proteins seem to be differentially involved in maintaining DNA methylation imprint at a subset of imprinted regions in ES cells and EBs.

Abstract: Long-term and high-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) supplementation has been linked to osteoporosis. In this study, we studied the protective role of plumbagin against GC-induced cell damage in MC3T3-E1 cells. The effect of dexamethasone (DEX) and plumbagin on cell viability was determined. DEX showed as IC-50 value of 95 μM. Further, 10μm plumbagin treatment effectively ameliorated DEX-induced cell death by increasing the cell viability to 92 %. A further effect of plumbagin on DEX-induced oxidative stress was determined through reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, lipid peroxide content, and antioxidant status. Nrf-2 nuclear localization was analyzed through immunofluorescence. Protein expression of redox regulator Nrf-2 and their target genes HO-1 and NQO1 and osteogenic markers (OCN, OPN Runx-2) were determined by Western blot. Apoptotic effect was analyzed by mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase activities (3, 8, and 9). The results showed that DEX treatment showed a significant increase in oxidative stress through increased ROS levels and downregulation of cytoprotective antioxidant proteins and antioxidant enzyme activities. Further DEX treatment downregulated the osteogenic markers and upregulated apoptosis through decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and upregulation of caspase activities. Plumbagin treatment significantly reversed the levels of oxidative stress and apoptotic markers and protected against DEX-induced cell damage. Further, plumbagin treatment significantly improved the expression of osteogenic markers compared to DEX treatment. In conclusion, the present study shows that plumbagin offers significant protective role against DEX-induced cellular damage via regulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and osteogenic markers.

Abstract: Glial scar formation derived from astrocyte proliferation and migration influences the functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1, whose activity is closely related to its phosphorylation state, reportedly regulates astrocyte proliferation and migration. In this study, we reported that p27Kip1 undergoes O-GlcNAc modification at Ser 2, Ser 110 and Thr 197. Inhibiting O-GlcNAcylation on Ser 2 by gene mutation (S2A) attenuated the phosphorylation of Ser 10, and vice versa. Interestingly, compared with wild type p27Kip1, S2A p27Kip1 displayed a decreased interaction with CRM1 and reduced nuclear export following serum starvation and release. In addition, the interaction between stathmin and S2A p27Kip1 was also decreased. Cytoskeletal proteins microtubules appeared high density in astrocytes transfected with S2A p27Kip1 especially at the leading edge of the scratch wound. Accordingly, scratch-wound assay revealed that the motility of astrocytes transfected with S2A p27Kip1 was faster than that of control. Finally, we injected lentiviral vectors immediately after spinal cord contusion, and found the lesion volume of the rat injected with S2A p27Kip1 was smaller than that of rat injected with wild type p27Kip1. Besides, the BBB and CBS behavioral tests showed greater functional recovery in S2A p27Kip1 treated rats. Taken together, our findings revealed a novel function of O-GlcNAc modification of p27Kip1 in mediating astrocytes migration and functional recovery after spinal cord contusion.

Abstract: Human dental pulp-derived stem cells (hDPSCs) are characterized by a typical fibroblast-like morphology. They express specific markers for mesenchymal stem cells and are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, adipoblasts and neurons in vitro. Previous studies showed that gangliosides are involved in the induction of early neuronal differentiation of hDPSCs. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of lipid rafts in this process. Lipid rafts are signaling microdomains enriched in glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, tyrosine kinase receptors, mono- or heterotrimeric G proteins and GPI-anchored proteins. We preliminary showed that established cells expressed multipotent mesenchymal stromal-specific surface antigens. Then, we analyzed the distribution of lipid rafts, revealing plasma membrane microdomains with GM2 and EGF-R enrichment. Following stimulation with EGF/bFGF, neuronal differentiation was observed. To analyze the functional role of lipid rafts in EGF/bFGF-induced hDPSCs differentiation, cells were preincubated with lipid raft affecting agents, i.e. [D]-PDMP or methyl-β-cyclodextrin. These compounds significantly prevented neuronal-specific antigen expression, as well as Akt and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, induced by EGF/bFGF, indicating that lipid raft integrity is essential for EGF/bFGF-induced hDPSCs differentiation. These results suggest that lipid rafts may represent specific chambers, where multimolecular signaling complexes, including lipids (gangliosides, cholesterol) and proteins (EGF-R), play a role in hDPSCs differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex utilizes two subunits, Eaf3 and Rco1, to recognize nucleosomes methylated at H3K36 (H3K36me) with high affinity and strong specificity. However, the chromobarrel domain of Eaf3 (CHD) that is responsible for H3K36me recognition only binds weakly and with little specificity to histone peptides. Here, using deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS), we detected conformational changes of Rpd3S upon its contact with chromatin. Interestingly, we found that the Sin3-interacting domain of Rco1 (SID) allosterically stimulates preferential binding of Eaf3 to H3K36-methylated peptides. This activation is tightly regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism to ensure optimal multivalent engagement of Rpd3S with nucleosomes. Lastly, we identified mutations at the interface between SID and Eaf3 that do not disrupt complex integrity but severely compromise Rpd3S functions in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the nucleosome-induced conformational changes are essential for chromatin recognition.

Abstract: Summary
Multipotent human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) harbor immunomodulatory properties that are therapeutically relevant. One of the most clinically important populations of leukocytes is the interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-secreting T (Th17) lymphocytes. However, mechanisms of hMSC and Th17 cell interactions are incompletely resolved. We found that, along with Th1 responses, hMSCs strongly suppressed Th17 responses and this required both IL-25—also known as IL-17E—as well as programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), a potent cell surface ligand for tolerance induction. Knockdown of IL-25 expression in hMSCs abrogated Th17 suppression in vitro and in vivo. However, IL-25 alone was insufficient to significantly suppress Th17 responses, which also required surface PD-L1 expression. Critically, IL-25 upregulated PD-L1 surface expression through the signaling pathways of JNK and STAT3, with STAT3 found to constitutively occupy the proximal region of the PD-L1 promoter. Our findings demonstrate the complexities of hMSC-mediated Th17 suppression, and highlight the IL-25/STAT3/PD-L1 axis as a candidate therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Apicomplexans invade a variety of metazoan host cells through mechanisms involving host cell receptor engagement and secretion of parasite factors to facilitate cellular attachment. We find that the parasite homolog of calcineurin, a calcium-regulated phosphatase complex central to signal transduction in eukaryotes, also contributes to host cell invasion by the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and related Toxoplasma gondii. Using reverse-genetic and chemical-genetic approaches, we determine that calcineurin critically regulates and stabilizes attachment of extracellular P. falciparum to host erythrocytes before intracellular entry and has similar functions in host cell engagement by T. gondii. Calcineurin-mediated Plasmodium invasion is strongly associated with host receptors required for host cell recognition, and calcineurin function distinguishes this form of receptor-mediated attachment from a second mode of host-parasite adhesion independent of host receptors. This specific role of calcineurin in coordinating physical interactions with host cells highlights an ancestral mechanism for parasitism used by apicomplexans.

Abstract: The turnover of extracellular matrix liberates various cryptic molecules with novel biological activities. Endostatin is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor that is derived from the non-collagenous domain of collagen XVIII. Although there are a large number of studies on its anti-tumor effects, the molecular mechanisms are not yet completely understood, and the reasons why endostatin has not been successful in clinical trials are unclear. Research has mostly focused on its anti-angiogenic effect in tumors. Here, we aimed to elucidate how endostatin affects the behavior of aggressive tongue HSC-3 carcinoma cells that were transfected to overproduce endostatin. Endostatin inhibited the invasion of HSC-3 cells in a 3D collagen–fibroblast model. However, it had no effect on invasion in a human myoma organotypic model, which lacks vital fibroblasts. Recombinant endostatin was able to reduce the Transwell migration of normal fibroblasts, but had no effect on carcinoma associated fibroblasts. Surprisingly, endostatin increased the proliferation and decreased the apoptosis of cancer cells in organotypic models. Also subcutaneous tumors overproducing endostatin grew bigger, but showed less local invasion in nude mice xenografts. We conclude that endostatin affects directly to HSC-3 cells increasing their proliferation, but its net effect on cancer invasion seem to depend on the cellular composition and interactions of tumor microenvironment.

Abstract: Cranial neural crest-derived cells (CNCCs) play important role in epithelial–mesenchymal interactions during tooth morphogenesis. However, the heterogeneity of CNCCs and their tendency to spontaneously differentiate along smooth muscle or osteoblast lineages in vitro limit further understanding of their biological properties. We studied the differentiation properties of isolated rat embryonic postmigratory CNCCs, expressing p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). These p75NTR positive (p75+) CNCCs, isolated using fluorescence activated cell sorter, exhibited fibroblast-like morphology and characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells. Incubation of p75+ CNCCs in dental follicle cell conditioned medium (DFCCM) combined with dentin non-collagenous proteins (dNCPs), altered their morphological features to cementoblast-like appearance. These cells also showed low proliferative activity, high ALP activity and significantly increased calcified nodule formation. Markers related to mineralization or specific to cementoblast lineage were highly expressed in dNCPs/DFCCM-treated p75+ cells, suggesting their differentiation along cementoblast-like lineage. p75+ stem cells selected from postmigratory CNCCs represent a pure stem cell population and could be used as a stem cell model for in vitro studies due to their intrinsic ability to differentiate to neuronal cells and transform from neuroectoderm to ectomesenchyme. They can provide a potential stem cell resource for tooth engineering studies and help to further investigate mechanisms of epithelial–mesenchymal interactions in tooth morphogenesis.

Abstract: Cutaneous lipids, endogenously synthetized and transported by lipoproteins, play a pivotal role in maintaining skin barrier. An impairment of extracutaneous lipid trafficking leads to the development of xanthomas, mostly arising in hyperlipidemic patients, but also in subjects with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency. The aim of this work was to evaluate, in a genetically modified mouse model, lacking two protein components of HDL particles, apolipoprotein(apo)E and apoA-I, the effect of HDL deficiency on skin morphology. Control mice (C57BL/6), apoE deficient mice (EKO), apoA-I deficient mice (A-IKO) and apoA-I/apoE double knockout mice (A-IKO/EKO) were maintained on a low-fat/low-cholesterol diet up to 30 weeks of age. At sacrifice, skin biopsies were processed for light (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Whereas the skin of EKO, A-IKO, and C57BL/6 mice was comparable, LM analysis in A-IKO/EKO mice showed an increase in dermal thickness and the presence of foam cells and T lymphocytes in reticular dermis. TEM analysis revealed the accumulation of cholesterol clefts in the papillary dermis and of cholesterol crystals within foam cells. In conclusion, A-IKO/EKO mice represent an experimental model for investigating the cutaneous phenotype of human HDL deficiency, thus mimicking a condition in which human xanthomatous lesions can develop.

Abstract: 14-3-3 proteins are intracellularly expressed as ubiquitous adaptor proteins. Here, we found localization of 14-3-3δ/ξ on the neuronal cell surface. 14-3-3δ/ξ was identified as a membrane target for 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). 15d-PGJ2 is a pathological mediator of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A causative peptide for AD, amyloid β, is one of binding partner of 14-3-3δ/ξ. Non-permeabilized neurons were used to avoid the intracellular effects of anti-14-3-3δ/ξ antibody in the present study. The plasmalemmal 14-3-3δ/ξ, but not the cytosolic one, was stimulated by its specific antibody, resulting in neuronal cell death. The neurotoxicity of anti-14-3-3δ/ξ antibody was suppressed by an antioxidant, catalase. Catalase prevented neurons from anti-14-3-3δ/ξ antibody-generating neurotoxic H2O2. The neuroprotective effect of catalase was also detected with the post-treatment of neurons after the application of anti-14-3-3δ/ξ antibody. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade is a down-stream consequence of H2O2 exposure. A c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor suppressed anti-14-3-3δ/ξ antibody-induced neuronal cell death. To my knowledge, this is the first report that the antibody-stimulated plasmalemmal 14-3-3δ/ξ induced neuronal cell death. Furthermore, H2O2 and JNK contributed to the neurotoxicity of anti-14-3-3δ/ξ antibody as well as those of amyloid β and 15d-PGJ2.

Abstract: Summary
CTG repeat expansion in DMPK, the cause of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), frequently results in hypermethylation and reduced SIX5 expression. The contribution of hypermethylation to disease pathogenesis and the precise mechanism by which SIX5 expression is reduced are unknown. Using 14 different DM1-affected human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines, we characterized a differentially methylated region (DMR) near the CTGs. This DMR undergoes hypermethylation as a function of expansion size in a way that is specific to undifferentiated cells and is associated with reduced SIX5 expression. Using functional assays, we provide evidence for regulatory activity of the DMR, which is lost by hypermethylation and may contribute to DM1 pathogenesis by causing SIX5 haplo-insufficiency. This study highlights the power of hESCs in disease modeling and describes a DMR that functions both as an exon coding sequence and as a regulatory element whose activity is epigenetically hampered by a heritable mutation.

Abstract: Summary
Clearance of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) is achieved through phagocytosis by professional or amateur phagocytes. It is critical for tissue homeostasis and remodeling in all animals. Failure in this process can contribute to the development of inflammatory autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases. We found previously that the PALL-SCF E3-ubiquitin ligase complex promotes apoptotic cell clearance, but it remained unclear how it did so. Here we show that the F-box protein PALL interacts with phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (RpS6) to promote its ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. This leads to RAC2 GTPase upregulation and activation and F-actin remodeling that promotes efferocytosis. We further show that the specific role of PALL in efferocytosis is driven by its apoptotic cell-induced nuclear export. Finding a role for RpS6 in the negative regulation of efferocytosis provides the opportunity to develop new strategies to regulate this process.

Abstract: Summary
In meiosis, cohesin is required for sister chromatid cohesion, as well as meiotic chromosome axis assembly and recombination. However, mechanisms underlying the multifunctional nature of cohesin remain elusive. Here, we show that fission yeast casein kinase 1 (CK1) plays a crucial role in assembling the meiotic chromosome axis (so-called linear element: LinE) and promoting recombination. An in vitro phosphorylation screening assay identified meiotic cohesin subunit Rec11/SA3 as an excellent substrate of CK1. The phosphorylation of Rec11 by CK1 mediates the interaction with the Rec10/Red1/SCP2 axis component, a key step in meiotic chromosome axis assembly, and is dispensable for sister chromatid cohesion. Crucially, the expression of Rec11-Rec10 fusion protein nearly completely bypasses the requirement for CK1 or cohesin phosphorylation for LinE assembly and recombination. This study uncovers a central mechanism of the cohesin-dependent assembly of the meiotic chromosome axis and recombination apparatus that acts independently of sister chromatid cohesion.

Abstract: Summary
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation from latent neuronal infection requires stimulation of lytic gene expression from promoters associated with repressive heterochromatin. Various neuronal stresses trigger reactivation, but how these stimuli activate silenced promoters remains unknown. We show that a neuronal pathway involving activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), common to many stress responses, is essential for initial HSV gene expression during reactivation. This JNK activation in neurons is mediated by dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) and JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3), which direct JNK toward stress responses instead of other cellular functions. Surprisingly, JNK-mediated viral gene induction occurs independently of histone demethylases that remove repressive lysine modifications. Rather, JNK signaling results in a histone methyl/phospho switch on HSV lytic promoters, a mechanism permitting gene expression in the presence of repressive lysine methylation. JNK is present on viral promoters during reactivation, thereby linking a neuronal-specific stress pathway and HSV reactivation from latency.

Abstract: Established from the calvaria of newborn macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-deficient mice, OP9 is a stromal cell line that used as a feeder layer to support the in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into various hematopoietic lineage cells, including granulocytes, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and megakaryocytes. However, as a primary culture cell line, OP9 can be used as stromal cells for only 1 month. Therefore, to obtain functional OP9 cells, numerous M-CSF-deficient newborn mice must be sacrificed. These limitations in some ways restrict the application of OP9 cells in longterm and largescale experiments. In this study, we used human papillomavirus 16 E6 and E7 genes to generate immortalized OP9 stromal cells, designated I-OP9 cells, and then tested their ability to support the megakaryocytic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells in vitro. I-OP9 cells have similar morphology and properties as do parental OP9 cells, and, as expected, have an extended lifespan and can support megakaryocytic differentiation. Our data suggest that the method used in this study, including establishing I-OP9 cells, enables the possibility to enlarge and lengthen the scale of the experiment and, more critically, provides a humanistic approach for preparing stromal cells that support the hematopoietic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells in vitro.

Abstract: Flowering time (or heading date) is controlled by intrinsic genetic programs in response to environmental cues, such as photoperiod and temperature. Rice, a facultative short-day (SD) plant, flowers early in SD and late in long-day (LD) conditions. Casein kinases (CKs) generally act as positive regulators in many signaling pathways in plants. In rice, Heading date 6 (Hd6) and Hd16 encode CK2α and CKI, respectively, and mainly function to delay flowering time. Additionally, the major LD-dependent floral repressors Hd2/Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator 37 (OsPRR37; hereafter PRR37) and Ghd7 also confer strong photoperiod sensitivity. In floral induction, Hd16 acts upstream of Ghd7 and CKI interacts with and phosphorylates Ghd7. In addition, Hd6 and Hd16 also act upstream of Hd2. However, whether CKI and CK2α directly regulate the function of PRR37 remains unclear. Here, we use in vitro pull-down and in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays to show that CKI and CK2α interact with PRR37. We further use in vitro kinase assays to show that CKI and CK2α phosphorylate different regions of PRR37. Our results indicate that direct posttranslational modification of PRR37 mediates the genetic interactions between these two protein kinases and PRR37. The significance of CK-mediated phosphorylation for PRR37 and Ghd7 function is discussed.

Abstract: Summary
Circular RNAs (circRNAs), an abundant class of noncoding RNAs in higher eukaryotes, are generated from pre-mRNAs by circularization of adjacent exons. Using a set of 15 circRNAs, we demonstrated their cell-type-specific expression and circular versus linear processing in mammalian cells. Northern blot analysis combined with RNase H cleavage conclusively proved a circular configuration for two examples, LPAR1 and HIPK3. To address the circularization mechanism, we analyzed the sequence requirements using minigenes derived from natural circRNAs. Both canonical splice sites are required for circularization, although they vary in flexibility and potential use of cryptic sites. Surprisingly, we found that no specific circRNA exon sequence is necessary and that potential flanking intron structures can modulate circularization efficiency. In combination with splice inhibitor assays, our results argue that the canonical spliceosomal machinery functions in circRNA biogenesis, constituting an alternative splicing mode.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing of Fas/CD95 exon 6 generates either a membrane-bound receptor that promotes, or a soluble isoform that inhibits, apoptosis. Using an automatized genome-wide siRNA screening for alternative splicing regulators of endogenous transcripts in mammalian cells, we identified 200 genes whose knockdown modulates the ratio between Fas/CD95 isoforms. These include classical splicing regulators; core spliceosome components; and factors implicated in transcription and chromatin remodeling, RNA transport, intracellular signaling, and metabolic control. Coherent effects of genes involved in iron homeostasis and pharmacological modulation of iron levels revealed a link between intracellular iron and Fas/CD95 exon 6 inclusion. A splicing regulatory network linked iron levels with reduced activity of the Zinc-finger-containing splicing regulator SRSF7, and in vivo and in vitro assays revealed that iron inhibits SRSF7 RNA binding. Our results uncover numerous links between cellular pathways and RNA processing and a mechanism by which iron homeostasis can influence alternative splicing.

Abstract: Epibrassinolide (EBR), a steroid-derived plant growth regulator, has been recently suggested as an apoptotic inducer in different cancer cells. In this experimental study, we investigated the potential apoptotic effect of EBR on stress-related and survival signaling molecules in colon carcinoma cells. EBR decreased cell viability and colony formation in HCT 116 and HT-29 colon carcinoma cells. The inactivation of PI3K/AKT by EBR treatment led to upregulation of Foxo3a, which in turn induced apoptosis in HCT 116 and HT-29 cells. In addition, the upstream non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase Src was found elevated allowing to the upregulation of p38, stress-activated protein kinase/Jun amino-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and their target genes c-jun, c-fos and c-myc in a time-dependent manner in HCT 116 cells within 48h. The alterations in PA metabolism caused intracellular PA pool decrease. The upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bak, Bax, Puma and Bim were accompanied with the decrease in Mcl-1 in HCT 116 and Bcl-xL expression profiles in HT-29 following 48h EBR treatment. We suggest that the upregulation of Bim expression levels might be related with one of the PI3K/AKT target transcription factor Foxo3a, which was dephosphorylated by EBR treatment in HCT 116 and HT-29 cells.

Abstract: Chronic airway diseases are characterized by airway remodeling which is attributed partly to the proliferation and migration of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels have been identified in ASMCs. Mount evidence has suggested that KATP channel openers can reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and alleviate airway remodeling. Opening K+ channels triggers K+ efflux, which leading to membrane hyperpolarization, preventing Ca2+entry through closing voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. Intracellular Ca2+ is the most important regulator of muscle contraction, cell proliferation and migration. K+ efflux decreases Ca2+ influx, which consequently influences ASMCs proliferation and migration. As a KATP channel opener, iptakalim (Ipt) has been reported to restrain the proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) involved in vascular remodeling, while little is known about its impact on ASMCs. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of Ipt on human ASMCs and the mechanisms underlying. Results obtained from cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation showed that Ipt significantly inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced ASMCs proliferation. ASMCs migration induced by PDGF-BB was also suppressed by Ipt in transwell migration and scratch assay. Besides, the phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase B (Akt), and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) were as well alleviated by Ipt administration. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of Ipt on the PDGF-BB-induced proliferation and migration in human ASMCs was blocked by glibenclamide (Gli), a selective KATP channel antagonist. These findings provide a strong evidence to support that Ipt antagonize the proliferating and migrating effects of PDGF-BB on human ASMCs through opening KATP channels. Altogether, our results highlighted a novel profile of Ipt as a potent option against the airway remodeling in chronic airway diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Hundreds of transcription factors (TFs) are expressed in each cell type, but cell identity can be induced through the activity of just a small number of core TFs. Systematic identification of these core TFs for a wide variety of cell types is currently lacking and would establish a foundation for understanding the transcriptional control of cell identity in development, disease, and cell-based therapy. Here, we describe a computational approach that generates an atlas of candidate core TFs for a broad spectrum of human cells. The potential impact of the atlas was demonstrated via cellular reprogramming efforts where candidate core TFs proved capable of converting human fibroblasts to retinal pigment epithelial-like cells. These results suggest that candidate core TFs from the atlas will prove a useful starting point for studying transcriptional control of cell identity and reprogramming in many human cell types.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of histone acetylation is fundamental to the utilization of eukaryotic genomes in chromatin. Aberrant acetylation contributes to disease and can be clinically combated by inhibiting the responsible enzymes. Our knowledge of the histone acetylation system is patchy because we so far lacked the methodology to describe acetylation patterns and their genesis by integrated enzyme activities. We devised a generally applicable, mass spectrometry-based strategy to precisely and accurately quantify combinatorial modification motifs. This was applied to generate a comprehensive inventory of acetylation motifs on histones H3 and H4 in Drosophila cells. Systematic depletion of known or suspected acetyltransferases and deacetylases revealed specific alterations of histone acetylation signatures, established enzyme-substrate relationships, and unveiled an extensive crosstalk between neighboring modifications. Unexpectedly, overall histone acetylation levels remained remarkably constant upon depletion of individual acetyltransferases. Conceivably, the acetylation level is adjusted to maintain the global charge neutralization of chromatin and the stability of nuclei.

Abstract: Summary
Tools for rapid and efficient transgenesis in “safe harbor” loci in an isogenic context remain important to exploit the possibilities of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We created hPSC master cell lines suitable for FLPe recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) in the AAVS1 locus that allow generation of transgenic lines within 15 days with 100% efficiency and without random integrations. Using RMCE, we successfully incorporated several transgenes useful for lineage identification, cell toxicity studies, and gene overexpression to study the hepatocyte lineage. However, we observed unexpected and variable transgene expression inhibition in vitro, due to DNA methylation and other unknown mechanisms, both in undifferentiated hESC and differentiating hepatocytes. Therefore, the AAVS1 locus cannot be considered a universally safe harbor locus for reliable transgene expression in vitro, and using it for transgenesis in hPSC will require careful assessment of the function of individual transgenes.

Abstract: Summary
The in vitro derivation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is complicated by the existence of multiple overlapping embryonic blood cell programs called primitive, erythromyeloid progenitor (EMP), and definitive. As HSCs are only generated during the definitive stage of hematopoiesis, deciphering the regulatory pathways that control the emergence of this program and identifying markers that distinguish it from the other programs are essential. To identify definitive specific pathways and marker sets, we used label-free proteomics to determine the proteome of embryo-derived and mouse embryonic stem cell-derived VE-CADHERIN+CD45− definitive hematopoietic progenitors. With this approach, we identified Stat1 as a marker that distinguishes the definitive erythroid lineage from the primitive- and EMP-derived lineages. Additionally, we provide evidence that the generation of the Stat1+ definitive lineage is dependent on Sox17. These findings establish an approach for monitoring the emergence of definitive hematopoiesis in the PSC differentiation cultures.

Abstract: Protein kinase Bα (PKBα)/AKT1 and PKBβ/AKT2 are required for normal peripheral insulin action but their role in pancreatic β cells remains enigmatic as indicated by the relatively mild islet phenotype of mice with deficiency for either one of these two isoforms. In this study we have analysed proliferation, apoptosis, β cell size and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in human islets overexpressing either PKBα or PKBβ. Our results reveal redundant and specific functions. Overexpression of either isoform resulted in increased β cell size, but insulin production and secretion remained unchanged. Proliferation and apoptosis of β cells were only significantly stimulated and inhibited, respectively, by PKBα/AKT1. Importantly, overexpression of PKBα/AKT1 in dissociated islets increased the ratio of β cells to non-β cells. These results confirm our previous findings obtained with rodent islets and strongly indicate that PKBα/AKT1 can regulate β cell mass also in human islets.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are preserved in co-cultures with UG26-1B6 stromal cells or their conditioned medium. We performed a genome-wide study of gene expression changes of UG26-1B6 stromal cells in contact with Lineage− SCA-1+ KIT+ (LSK) cells. This analysis identified connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) to be upregulated in response to LSK cells. We found that co-culture of HSCs on CTGF knockdown stroma (shCtgf) shows impaired engraftment and long-term quality. Further experiments demonstrated that CD34− CD48− CD150+ LSK (CD34− SLAM) cell numbers from shCtgf co-cultures increase in G0 and senescence and show delayed time to first cell division. To understand this observation, a CTGF signaling network model was assembled, which was experimentally validated. In co-culture experiments of CD34− SLAM cells with shCtgf stromal cells, we found that SMAD2/3-dependent signaling was activated, with increasing p27Kip1 expression and downregulating cyclin D1. Our data support the view that LSK cells modulate gene expression in the niche to maintain repopulating HSC activity.

Abstract: Microglia are the resident macrophage and immune cell of the brain and are critically involved in combating disease and assaults on the brain. Virtually all brain pathologies are accompanied by acidosis of the interstitial fluid, meaning that microglia are exposed to an acidic environment. However, little is known about how extracellular acidosis impacts on microglial function. The activity of microglia is tightly controlled by ‘on’ and ‘off’ signals, the presence or absence of which results in generation of distinct phenotypes in microglia. Activation of G protein coupled purinergic (P2Y) receptors triggers a number of distinct behaviours in microglia, including activation, migration, and phagocytosis. Using pharmacological tools and fluorescence imaging of the murine cerebellar microglia cell line C8B4, we show that extracellular acidosis interferes with P2Y receptor-mediated Ca2+ signalling in these cells. Distinct P2Y receptors give rise to signature intracellular Ca2+ signals, and Ca2+ release from stores and Ca2+ influx are differentially affected by acidotic conditions: Ca2+ release is virtually unaffected, whereas Ca2+ influx, mediated at least in part by store-operated Ca2+ channels, is profoundly inhibited. Furthermore, P2Y1 and P2Y6-mediated stimulation of migration is inhibited under conditions of extracellular acidosis, whereas basal migration independent of P2Y receptor activation is not. Taken together, our results demonstrate that an acidic microenvironment impacts on P2Y receptor-mediated Ca2+ signalling, thereby influencing microglial responses and responsiveness to extracellular signals. This may result in altered behaviour of microglia under pathological conditions compared with microglial responses in healthy tissue.

Abstract: Summary
PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis consists of two sequential steps: primary piRNA processing and the ping-pong cycle that depends on reciprocal Slicer-mediated RNA cleavage by PIWI proteins. However, the molecular functions of the factors involved remain elusive. Here, we show that RNAs cleaved by a Bombyx mori PIWI, Siwi, remain bound to the protein upon cleavage but are released by a DEAD box protein BmVasa. BmVasa copurifies with Siwi but not another PIWI BmAgo3. A lack of BmVasa does not affect primary piRNA processing but abolishes the ping-pong cycle. Siwi also forms a complex with BmSpn-E and BmQin. This complex is physically separable from the Siwi/BmVasa complex. BmSpn-E, unlike BmVasa, is necessary for primary piRNA production. We propose a model for piRNA biogenesis, where the BmSpn-E/BmQin dimer binds Siwi to function in primary piRNA processing, whereas BmVasa, by associating with Siwi, ensures target RNA release upon cleavage to facilitate the ping-pong cycle.

Abstract: Introduction
Satellite cells are muscle resident stem cells and are responsible for muscle regeneration. In this study we investigate the involvement of PKCε during muscle stem cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Here, we describe the identification of a previously unrecognized role for the PKCε–HMGA1 signaling axis in myoblast differentiation and regeneration processes.
Methods
PKCε expression was modulated in the C2C12 cell line and primary murine satellite cells in vitro, as well as in an in vivo model of muscle regeneration. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and shRNA silencing techniques were used to determine the role of PKCε and HMGA1 in myogenic differentiation.
Results
PKCε expression increases and subsequently re-localizes to the nucleus during skeletal muscle cell differentiation. In the nucleus, PKCε blocks Hmga1 expression to promote Myogenin and Mrf4 accumulation and myoblast formation. Following in vivo muscle injury, PKCε accumulates in regenerating, centrally-nucleated myofibers. Pharmacological inhibition of PKCε impairs the expression of two crucial markers of muscle differentiation, namely MyoD and Myogenin, during injury induced muscle regeneration.
Conclusion
This work identifies the PKCε–HMGA1 signaling axis as a positive regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Isolation of ventricular cardiomyocytes (vCMs) has been challenging due to the lack of specific surface markers. Here we show that vCMs can be purified from differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) using molecular beacons (MBs) targeting specific intracellular mRNAs. We designed MBs (IRX4 MBs) to target mRNA encoding Iroquois homeobox protein 4 (Irx4), a transcription factor specific for vCMs. To purify mESC vCMs, IRX4 MBs were delivered into cardiomyogenically differentiating mESCs, and IRX4 MBs-positive cells were FACS-sorted. We found that, of the cells isolated, ∼98% displayed vCM-like action potentials by electrophysiological analyses. These MB-purified vCMs continuously maintained their CM characteristics as verified by spontaneous beating, Ca2+ transient, and expression of vCM-specific proteins. Our study shows the feasibility of isolating pure vCMs via cell sorting without modifying host genes. The homogeneous and functional ventricular CMs generated via the MB-based method can be useful for disease investigation, drug discovery, and cell-based therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Since the first generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), several reprogramming systems have been used to study its molecular mechanisms. However, the system of choice largely affects the reprogramming efficiency, influencing our view on the mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that reprogramming triggered by less efficient polycistronic reprogramming cassettes not only highlights mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) as a roadblock but also faces more severe difficulties to attain a pluripotent state even post-MET. In contrast, more efficient cassettes can reprogram both wild-type and Nanog−/− fibroblasts with comparable efficiencies, routes, and kinetics, unlike the less efficient reprogramming systems. Moreover, we attribute a previously reported variation in the N terminus of KLF4 as a dominant factor underlying these critical differences. Our data establish that some reprogramming roadblocks are system dependent, highlighting the need to pursue mechanistic studies with close attention to the systems to better understand reprogramming.

Abstract: The merging of knowledge from genomics, cellular signal transduction and molecular evolution is producing new paradigms of cancer analysis. Protein kinases have long been understood to initiate and promote malignant cell growth and targeting kinases to fight cancer has been a major strategy within the pharmaceutical industry for over two decades. Despite the initial success of kinase inhibitors (KIs), the ability of cancer to evolve resistance and reprogram oncogenic signaling networks has reduced the efficacy of kinase targeting. The molecular chaperone HSP90 physically supports global kinase function while also acting as an evolutionary capacitor. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has compiled a trove of data indicating that a large percentage of tumors overexpress or possess mutant kinases that depend on the HSP90 molecular chaperone complex. Moreover, the overexpression or mutation of parallel activators of kinase activity (PAKA) increases the number of components that promote malignancy and indirectly associate with HSP90. Therefore, targeting HSP90 is predicted to complement kinase inhibitors by inhibiting oncogenic reprogramming and cancer evolution. Based on this hypothesis, consideration should be given by both the research and clinical communities towards combining kinase inhibitors and HSP90 inhibitors (H90Ins) in combating cancer. The purpose of this perspective is to reflect on the current understanding of HSP90 and kinase biology as well as promote the exploration of potential synergistic molecular therapy combinations through the utilization of The Cancer Genome Atlas.

Abstract: Summary
The development of new gene-editing tools, in particular the CRISPR/Cas system, has greatly facilitated site-specific mutagenesis in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), including the introduction or correction of patient-specific mutations for disease modeling. However, integration of a reporter gene into an endogenous locus in hESCs still requires a lengthy and laborious two-step strategy that involves first drug selection to identify correctly targeted clones and then excision of the drug-resistance cassette. Through the use of iCRISPR, an efficient gene-editing platform we recently developed, this study demonstrates a knockin strategy without drug selection for both active and silent genes in hESCs. Lineage-specific hESC reporter lines are useful for real-time monitoring of cell-fate decisions and lineage tracing, as well as enrichment of specific cell populations during hESC differentiation. Thus, this selection-free knockin strategy is expected to greatly facilitate the use of hESCs for developmental studies, disease modeling, and cell-replacement therapy.

Genetic diversity enables a virus to colonize novel hosts, evade immunity, and evolve drug resistance. However, viral diversity is typically assessed at the population level. Given the existence of cell-to-cell variation, it is critical to understand viral genetic structure at the single-cell level. By combining single-cell isolation with ultra-deep sequencing, we characterized the genetic structure and diversity of a RNA virus shortly after single-cell bottlenecks. Full-length sequences from 881 viral plaques derived from 90 individual cells reveal that sequence variants pre-existing in different viral genomes can be co-transmitted within the same infectious unit to individual cells. Further, the rate of spontaneous virus mutation varies across individual cells, and early production of diversity depends on the viral yield of the very first infected cell. These results unravel genetic and structural features of a virus at the single-cell level, with implications for viral diversity and evolution.

Abstract: Summary
Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are fate restricted to differentiate into gametes in vivo. However, when removed from their embryonic niche, PGCs undergo reversion to pluripotent embryonic germ cells (EGCs) in vitro. One of the major differences between EGCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is variable methylation at imprinting control centers (ICCs), a phenomenon that is poorly understood. Here we show that reverting PGCs to EGCs involved stable ICC methylation erasure at Snrpn, Igf2r, and Kcnqot1. In contrast, the H19/Igf2 ICC undergoes erasure followed by de novo re-methylation. PGCs differentiated in vitro from ESCs completed Snrpn ICC erasure. However, the hypomethylated state is highly unstable. We also discovered that when the H19/Igf2 ICC was abnormally hypermethylated in ESCs, this is not erased in PGCs differentiated from ESCs. Therefore, launching PGC differentiation from ESC lines with appropriately methylated ICCs is critical to the generation of germline cells that recapitulate endogenous ICC erasure.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a potential source of transplantable cells for treating patients with diabetes. To investigate the impact of the host recipient on hESC-derived pancreatic progenitor cell maturation, cells were transplanted into immunodeficient SCID-beige mice or nude rats. Following the transplant, basal human C-peptide levels were consistently higher in mice compared with rats, but only rats showed robust meal- and glucose-responsive human C-peptide secretion by 19–21 weeks. Grafts from rats contained a higher proportion of insulin:glucagon immunoreactivity, fewer exocrine cells, and improved expression of mature β cell markers compared with mice. Moreover, ECM-related genes were enriched, the collagen network was denser, and blood vessels were more intricately integrated into the engrafted endocrine tissue in rats relative to mice. Overall, hESC-derived pancreatic progenitor cells matured faster in nude rats compared with SCID-beige mice, indicating that the host recipient can greatly influence the fate of immature pancreatic progenitor cells post-transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Biofilms—communities of bacteria encased in a polymer-rich matrix—confer bacteria with the ability to persist in pathologic host contexts, such as the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways. How bacteria assemble polymers into biofilms is largely unknown. We find that the extracellular matrix produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa self-assembles into a liquid crystal through entropic interactions between polymers and filamentous Pf bacteriophages, which are long, negatively charged filaments. This liquid crystalline structure enhances biofilm function by increasing adhesion and tolerance to desiccation and antibiotics. Pf bacteriophages are prevalent among P. aeruginosa clinical isolates and were detected in CF sputum. The addition of Pf bacteriophage to sputum polymers or serum was sufficient to drive their rapid assembly into viscous liquid crystals. Fd, a related bacteriophage of Escherichia coli, has similar biofilm-building capabilities. Targeting filamentous bacteriophage or the liquid crystalline organization of the biofilm matrix may represent antibacterial strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), the product of class III PI3K VPS34, recruits specific autophagic effectors, like WIPI2, during the initial steps of autophagosome biogenesis and thereby regulates canonical autophagy. However, mammalian cells can produce autophagosomes through enigmatic noncanonical VPS34-independent pathways. Here we show that PI(5)P can regulate autophagy via PI(3)P effectors and thereby identify a mechanistic explanation for forms of noncanonical autophagy. PI(5)P synthesis by the phosphatidylinositol 5-kinase PIKfyve was required for autophagosome biogenesis, and it increased levels of PI(5)P, stimulated autophagy, and reduced the levels of autophagic substrates. Inactivation of VPS34 impaired recruitment of WIPI2 and DFCP1 to autophagic precursors, reduced ATG5-ATG12 conjugation, and compromised autophagosome formation. However, these phenotypes were rescued by PI(5)P in VPS34-inactivated cells. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for alternative VPS34-independent autophagy-initiating pathways, like glucose starvation, and unravel a cytoplasmic function for PI(5)P, which previously has been linked predominantly to nuclear roles.

Abstract: Summary
Although SOX2+ stem cells are present in the postnatal pituitary gland, how they are regulated molecularly and whether they are required for pituitary functions remain unresolved questions. Using a conditional knockout animal model, here we demonstrate that ablation of the canonical Notch signaling in the embryonic pituitary gland leads to progressive depletion of the SOX2+ stem cells and hypoplastic gland. Furthermore, we show that the SOX2+ stem cells initially play a significant role in contributing to postnatal pituitary gland expansion by self-renewal and differentiating into distinct lineages in the immediate postnatal period. However, we found that within several weeks postpartum, the SOX2+ stem cells switch to an essentially dormant state and are no longer required for homeostasis/tissue adaptation. Our results present a dynamic tissue homeostatic model in which stem cells provide an initial contribution to the growth of the neonatal pituitary gland, whereas the mature gland can be maintained in a stem cell-independent fashion.

Abstract: Summary
Frequent tumor relapse in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been commonly attributed to the presence of residual cancer stem cells (CSCs) after conventional treatments. We have previously identified and characterized CD133 to mark a specific CSC subset in HCC. In the present study, we found endogenous and secretory annexin A3 (ANXA3) to play pivotal roles in promoting cancer and stem cell-like features in CD133+ liver CSCs through a dysregulated JNK pathway. Blockade of ANXA3 with an anti-ANXA3 monoclonal antibody in vitro as well as in human HCC xenograft models resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth and self-renewal. Clinically, ANXA3 expression in HCC patient sera closely associated with aggressive clinical features. Our results suggest that ANXA3 can serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker and that the inhibition of ANXA3 may be a viable therapeutic option for the treatment of CD133+ liver-CSC-driven HCC.

Profilin Regulates F-Actin Network Homeostasis by Favoring Formin over Arp2/3 Complex,

Abstract: Summary
Fission yeast cells use Arp2/3 complex and formin to assemble diverse filamentous actin (F-actin) networks within a common cytoplasm for endocytosis, division, and polarization. Although these homeostatic F-actin networks are usually investigated separately, competition for a limited pool of actin monomers (G-actin) helps to regulate their size and density. However, the mechanism by which G-actin is correctly distributed between rival F-actin networks is not clear. Using a combination of cell biological approaches and in vitro reconstitution of competition between actin assembly factors, we found that the small G-actin binding protein profilin directly inhibits Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly. Profilin is therefore required for formin to compete effectively with excess Arp2/3 complex for limited G-actin and to assemble F-actin for contractile ring formation in dividing cells.

Abstract: Summary
The 2013–present Western African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is the largest ever recorded with >28,000 reported cases. Ebola virus (EBOV) genome sequencing has played an important role throughout this outbreak; however, relatively few sequences have been determined from patients in Liberia, the second worst-affected country. Here, we report 140 EBOV genome sequences from the second wave of the Liberian outbreak and analyze them in combination with 782 previously published sequences from throughout the Western African outbreak. While multiple early introductions of EBOV to Liberia are evident, the majority of Liberian EVD cases are consistent with a single introduction, followed by spread and diversification within the country. Movement of the virus within Liberia was widespread, and reintroductions from Liberia served as an important source for the continuation of the already ongoing EVD outbreak in Guinea. Overall, little evidence was found for incremental adaptation of EBOV to the human host.

Abstract: Summary
Controversy over the role of antioxidants in cancer has persisted for decades. Here, we demonstrate that synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), driven by GCLM, is required for cancer initiation. Genetic loss of Gclm prevents a tumor’s ability to drive malignant transformation. Intriguingly, these findings can be replicated using an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, but only if delivered prior to cancer onset, suggesting that at later stages of tumor progression GSH becomes dispensable potentially due to compensation from alternative antioxidant pathways. Remarkably, combined inhibition of GSH and thioredoxin antioxidant pathways leads to a synergistic cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating the importance of these two antioxidants to tumor progression and as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Hopx distinguishes hippocampal from lateral ventricle neural stem cells,

Abstract: In the adult dentate gyrus (DG) and in the proliferative zone lining the lateral ventricle (LV-PZ), radial glia-like (RGL) cells are neural stem cells (NSCs) that generate granule neurons. A number of molecular markers including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Sox2 and nestin, can identify quiescent NSCs in these two niches. However, to date, there is no marker that distinguishes NSC origin of DG versus LV-PZ. Hopx, an atypical homeodomain only protein, is expressed by adult stem cell populations including those in the intestine and hair follicle. Here, we show that Hopx is specifically expressed in RGL cells in the adult DG, and these cells give rise to granule neurons. Assessed by non-stereological quantitation, Hopx-null NSCs exhibit enhanced neurogenesis evident by an increased number of BrdU-positive cells and doublecortin (DCX)-positive neuroblasts. In contrast, Sox2-positive, quiescent NSCs are reduced in the DG of Hopx-null animals and Notch signaling is reduced, as evidenced by reduced expression of Notch targets Hes1 and Hey2, and a reduction of the number of cells expressing the cleaved, activated form of the Notch1 receptor, the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in Hopx-null DG. Surprisingly, Hopx is not expressed in RGL cells of the adult LV-PZ, and Hopx-expressing cells do not give rise to interneurons of the olfactory bulb (OB). These findings establish that Hopx expression distinguishes NSCs of the DG from those of the LV-PZ, and suggest that Hopx potentially regulates hippocampal neurogenesis by modulating Notch signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Cajal bodies (CBs) are evolutionarily conserved nuclear structures involved in the metabolism of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). CBs are not present in all cell types, and the trigger for their formation is not yet known. Here, we depleted cells of factors required for the final steps of snRNP assembly and assayed for the presence of stalled intermediates in CBs. We show that depletion induces formation of CBs in cells that normally lack these nuclear compartments, suggesting that CB nucleation is triggered by an imbalance in snRNP assembly. Accumulation of stalled intermediates in CBs depends on the di-snRNP assembly factor SART3. SART3 is required for both the induction of CB formation as well as the tethering of incomplete snRNPs to coilin, the CB scaffolding protein. We propose a model wherein SART3 monitors tri-snRNP assembly and sequesters incomplete particles in CBs, thereby allowing cells to maintain a homeostatic balance of mature snRNPs in the nucleoplasm.

Abstract: Notch signaling pathway represents a principal cellular communication system that plays a pivotal role during development of metazoans. Drosophila misshapen (msn) encodes a protein kinase, which is related to the budding yeast Ste20p (sterile 20 protein) kinase. In a genetic screen, using candidate gene approach to identify novel kinases involved in Notch signaling, we identified msn as a novel regulator of Notch signaling. Data presented here suggest that overexpression of kinase active form of Msn exhibits phenotypes similar to Notch loss-of-function condition and msn genetically interacts with components of Notch signaling pathway. Kinase active form of Msn associates with Notch receptor and regulate its signaling activity. We further show that kinase active Misshapen leads to accumulation of membrane-tethered form of Notch. Moreover, activated Msn also depletes Armadillo and DE-Cadherin from adherens junctions. Thus, this study provides a yet unknown mode of regulation of Notch signaling by Misshapen.

Abstract: Summary
The bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) is estimated to live over 200 years and is possibly the longest-living mammal. These animals should possess protective molecular adaptations relevant to age-related diseases, particularly cancer. Here, we report the sequencing and comparative analysis of the bowhead whale genome and two transcriptomes from different populations. Our analysis identifies genes under positive selection and bowhead-specific mutations in genes linked to cancer and aging. In addition, we identify gene gain and loss involving genes associated with DNA repair, cell-cycle regulation, cancer, and aging. Our results expand our understanding of the evolution of mammalian longevity and suggest possible players involved in adaptive genetic changes conferring cancer resistance. We also found potentially relevant changes in genes related to additional processes, including thermoregulation, sensory perception, dietary adaptations, and immune response. Our data are made available online (http://www.bowhead-whale.org) to facilitate research in this long-lived species.

Abstract: Macrophage (MΦ) dysregulation is increasingly becoming recognized as a risk factor for a number of inflammatory complications including atherosclerosis, cancer, and the host response elicited by biomedical devices. It is still unclear what roles the pro-inflammatory (M1) MΦ and pro-healing (M2) MΦ phenotypes play during the healing process. However, it has been shown that a local overabundance of M1 MΦs can potentially lead to a chronically inflamed state of the tissue; while a local over-exuberant M2 MΦ response can lead to tissue fibrosis and even promote tumorigenesis. These notions strengthen the argument that the tight temporal regulation of this phenotype balance is necessary to promote inflammatory resolution that leads to tissue homeostasis. In this study, we have engineered pro-inflammatory MΦs, MΦ-cTLR4 cells, which can be activated to a M1-like MΦ phenotype with a small molecule, the chemical inducer of dimerization (CID) drug. The MΦ-cTLR4 cells when activated with the CID drug, express increased levels of TNFα, IL-6, and iNOS. Activated MΦ-cTLR4 cells stay stimulated for at least 48h; once the CID drug is withdrawn, the MΦ-cTLR4 cells return to baseline state within 18h. Further, in vitro CID-activated MΦ-cTLR4 cells induce upregulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on endothelial cells (EC) in a TNFα-dependent manner. With the ability to specifically modulate the MФ-cTLR4 cells with the presence or absence of a small molecule, we now have the tool necessary to observe a primarily M1 MФ response during inflammation. By isolating this phase of the wound healing response, it may be possible to determine conditions for ideal healing.

High levels of WNT-5A in human glioma correlate with increased presence of tumor-associated microglia/monocytes,

Abstract: Malignant gliomas are among the most severe types of cancer, and the most common primary brain tumors. Treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor. WNT-5A, a member of the WNT family of lipoglycoproteins, plays a role in oncogenesis and tumor progression in various cancers, whereas the role of WNT-5A in glioma remains obscure. Based on the role of WNT-5A as an oncogene, its potential to regulate microglia cells and the glioma-promoting capacities of microglia cells, we hypothesize that WNT-5A has a role in regulation of immune functions in glioma. We investigated WNT-5A expression by in silico analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) transcript profiling of human glioblastoma samples and immunohistochemistry experiments of human glioma tissue microarrays (TMA). Our results reveal higher WNT-5A protein levels and mRNA expression in a subgroup of gliomas (WNT-5Ahigh) compared to non-malignant control brain tissue. Furthermore, we show a significant correlation between WNT-5A in the tumor and presence of major histocompatibility complex Class II-positive microglia/monocytes. Our data pinpoint a positive correlation between WNT-5A and a proinflammatory signature in glioma. We identify increased presence of microglia/monocytes as an important aspect in the inflammatory transformation suggesting a novel role for WNT-5A in human glioma.

Abstract: Summary
Prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), an established antiepileptic drug, has been reported to impair postnatal cognitive function in children born to VPA-treated epileptic mothers. However, how these defects arise and how they can be overcome remain unknown. Using mice, we found that comparable postnatal cognitive functional impairment is very likely correlated to the untimely enhancement of embryonic neurogenesis, which led to depletion of the neural precursor cell pool and consequently a decreased level of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Moreover, hippocampal neurons in the offspring of VPA-treated mice showed abnormal morphology and activity. Surprisingly, these impairments could be ameliorated by voluntary running. Our study suggests that although prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs such as VPA may have detrimental effects that persist until adulthood, these effects may be offset by a simple physical activity such as running.

Abstract: Summary
Candida albicans is a well-tolerated resident of human mucosal tissues. This implies that host defense mechanisms cooperate to limit inflammation while controlling fungal burden. The cytokine IL-22 and inflammasomes are essential components of the mucosal responses to C. albicans. How these components cooperate to mediate the balance of inflammation and host defense is not explored. We find that NLRP3 inflammasome activation promotes neutrophil recruitment and inflammation during infection and that this activity is counteracted by IL-22. Mechanistically, IL-22 activated NLRC4 for sustained production of the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1Ra, which restrained NLRP3 activity. Symptomatic infection in mice and humans occurred under conditions of IL-1Ra deficiency and was rescued in mice by replacement therapy with the recombinant IL-1Ra anakinra. Thus, pathogenic inflammasome activity during Candida infection is negatively regulated by the IL-22/NLRC4/IL-1Ra axis. Our findings offer insights into the pathogenesis of C. albicans and suggest therapeutic avenues for candidiasis.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) sequentially generate neurons and glia during CNS development. Here we identified miRNA-153 (miR-153) as a modulator of the temporal regulation of NSPC differentiation. Overexpression (OE) of miR-153 delayed the onset of astrogliogenesis and maintained NSPCs in an undifferentiated state in vitro and in the developing cortex. The transcription factors nuclear factor I (NFI) A and B, essential regulators of the initiation of gliogenesis, were found to be targets of miR-153. Inhibition of miR-153 in early neurogenic NSPCs induced precocious gliogenesis, whereas NFIA/B overexpression rescued the anti-gliogenic phenotypes induced by miR-153 OE. Our results indicate that miR-mediated fine control of NFIA/B expression is important in the molecular networks that regulate the acquisition of gliogenic competence by NSPCs in the developing CNS.

Abstract: The role of serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins, which are ligands for toll-like receptors, was analyzed in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and their osteogenic offspring with a focus on senescence, differentiation and mineralization. In vitro aged hMSC developed a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), resulting in enhanced SAA1/2, TLR2/4 and proinflammatory cytokine (IL6, IL8, IL1β, CXCL1, CXCL2) expression before entering replicative senescence. Recombinant human SAA1 (rhSAA1) induced SASP-related genes and proteins in MSC, which could be abolished by cotreatment with the TLR4-inhibitor CLI-095. The same pattern of SASP-resembling genes was stimulated upon induction of osteogenic differentiation, which is accompanied by autocrine SAA1/2 expression. In this context additional rhSAA1 enhanced the SASP-like phenotype, accelerated the proinflammatory phase of osteogenic differentiation and enhanced mineralization. Autocrine/paracrine and rhSAA1 via TLR4 stimulate a proinflammatory phenotype that is both part of the early phase of osteogenic differentiation and the development of senescence. This signaling cascade is tightly involved in bone formation and mineralization, but may also propagate pathological extraosseous calcification conditions such as calcifying inflammation and atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Summary
SMC condensin complexes are central modulators of chromosome superstructure in all branches of life. Their SMC subunits form a long intramolecular coiled coil, which connects a constitutive “hinge” dimerization domain with an ATP-regulated “head” dimerization module. Here, we address the structural arrangement of the long coiled coils in SMC complexes. We unequivocally show that prokaryotic Smc-ScpAB, eukaryotic condensin, and possibly also cohesin form rod-like structures, with their coiled coils being closely juxtaposed and accurately anchored to the hinge. Upon ATP-induced binding of DNA to the hinge, however, Smc switches to a more open configuration. Our data suggest that a long-distance structural transition is transmitted from the Smc head domains to regulate Smc-ScpAB’s association with DNA. These findings uncover a conserved architectural theme in SMC complexes, provide a mechanistic basis for Smc’s dynamic engagement with chromosomes, and offer a molecular explanation for defects in Cornelia de Lange syndrome.

Abstract: The niche concept of stem cell biology proposes a functional unit between the precursor cells and their local microenvironment, to which several cell types might contribute by cell–cell contacts, extracellular matrix, and humoral factors. We here established three co-culture models (with cell types separated by membrane) for both adherent monolayers and neurospheres to address the potential influence of different niche cell types in the neurogenic zone of the adult hippocampus of mice. Astrocytes and endothelial cells enhanced precursor cell proliferation and neurosphere formation. Endothelial factors also led to a prolonged increase in proliferation after growth factor withdrawal, which otherwise induces differentiation. All niche cell types enhanced cell survival in monolayer cultures, endothelial cells also stimulated neuronal differentiation. A parallel trend elicited by astrocytes did not reach conventional statistical significance. Pericytes had variable effects here. We did not observe changes in differentiation in neurosphere co-cultures. In summary, our data indicate that in precursor cell culture protocols survival could be improved by adding as yet unknown factors physiologically contributed by astrocytes and endothelial cells. Our findings also underscore the complexity of the niche and the differential impact of factors from the different sources on distinct aspects of neuronal development. With the help of the models presented here, identification of these factors and their specific biological activity can now be initiated.

Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex immunological disorder characterized by chronic inflammation caused mainly by unknown factors. The interleukin-10 knockout (IL-10 KO) mouse is a well-established murine model of IBD which develops spontaneous intestinal inflammation that resembles Crohn's disease. In the present study, human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) were administrated to IL-10 KO mice to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of hAMSCs that may attenuate the progress of or treat IBD. After IBD was induced by feeding the IL-10 KO mouse a 125–250ppm piroxicam mixed diet for 1 week, 2×106 hAMSCs were injected into the peritoneum and the mice were switched to a normal diet. After 1 week, the mice were sacrificed and tissue samples were harvested. Tissue scores for inflammation and inflammation-related genes expression were determined. The hAMSC-treated group showed significantly reduced inflammatory changes in histological analysis. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that RANTES, Toll-like receptor 9, and IL-4 expression levels were not significantly different between the groups while IL-12, INF-γ, and TNF-α levels were significantly decreased in the hAMSC treated group. hAMSC attenuated IBD in the IL-10 KO mice by suppressing inflammatory cytokine expression, was mediated by the type 1 helper T cell pathway. Even though only a single injection of hAMSCs was delivered, the effect influenced chronic events associated with inflammatory changes and demonstrated that hAMSCs are a powerful candidate for IBD therapy.

Abstract: Osteoclasts are responsible for bone erosion in diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, we investigate the effects of eriodictyol, a flavonoid found naturally in citrus fruits, on the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation using mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). Eriodictyol inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. In addition, eriodictyol suppressed bone resorption activity of differentiated osteoclasts. The inhibitory effect of eriodictyol was associated with impaired activation of multiple signaling events downstream of RANK, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, and c-Jun terminal kinase phosphorylation, followed by decreased nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)c1 expression. Ectopic overexpression of a constitutively active form of NFATc1 completely rescued the anti-osteoclastogenic effect of eriodictyol, suggesting that the anti-osteoclastogenic effect was mainly attributed to the reduction in NFATc1 expression. Consistent with the in vitro anti-osteoclastogenic effect, eriodictyol suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced osteoclast formation in the calvarial model and ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo. Taken together, our data demonstrate that eriodictyol is a new therapeutic agent with the potential to prevent bone destructive diseases by reducing both osteoclast differentiation and function.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing is pervasive in vertebrates, yet little is known about most isoforms or their regulation. transformer-2b (tra2b) encodes a splicing regulator whose endogenous function is poorly understood. Tra2b knockdown in Xenopus results in embryos with multiple defects, including defective somitogenesis. Using RNA sequencing, we identify 142 splice changes (mostly intron retention and exon skipping), 89% of which are not in current annotations. A previously undescribed isoform of wnt11b retains the last intron, resulting in a truncated ligand (Wnt11b-short). We show that this isoform acts as a dominant-negative ligand in cardiac gene induction and pronephric tubule formation. To determine the contribution of Wnt11b-short to the tra2b phenotype, we induce retention of intron 4 in wnt11b, which recapitulates the failure to form somites but not other tra2b morphant defects. This alternative splicing of a Wnt ligand adds intricacy to a complex signaling pathway and highlights intron retention as a regulatory mechanism.

Abstract: Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADSC) is an important component of tumor microenvironment. However, whether ADSCs have a hand in ovarian cancer progression remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of human ADSCs derived from the omentum of normal donors on human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells in vitro and in vivo. Direct and indirect co-culture models including ADSCs and human EOC cell lines were established and the effects of ADSCs on EOC cell proliferation were evaluated by EdU incorporation and flow cytometry. Transwell migration assays and detection of MMPs were performed to assess the invasion activity of EOC cells in vitro. Mouse models were established by intraperitoneal injection of EOC cells with or without concomitant ADSCs to investigate the role of ADSCs in tumor progression in vivo. We found that ADSCs significantly promoted proliferation and invasion of EOC cells in both direct and indirect co-culture assays. In addition, after co-culture with ADSCs, EOC cells secreted higher levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and inhibition of MMP2 and MMP9 partially relieved the tumor-promoting effects of ADSCs in vitro. In mouse xenograft models, we confirmed that ADSCs promoted EOC growth and metastasis and elevated the expression of MMP2 and MMP9. Our findings indicate that omental ADSCs play a promotive role during ovarian cancer progression.

Combinatorial treatment of CD95L and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells induces apoptotic and RIP1-mediated necroptotic cell death network,

Abstract: Combination therapy of cancer is based on the cumulative effects mediated by several drugs. Although molecular mechanisms of action of each particular drug are partially elucidated, understanding of the dynamic cross-talk between different cell death pathways at the quantitative level induced by combination therapy is still missing. Here, we exemplified this question for the death receptor (DR) networks in pancreatic cancer cells. We demonstrate that the combined action of CD95L and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells leads to the simultaneous induction of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death. The pro-apoptotic effects are mediated through down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins c-FLIP and Mcl-1, while caspase-independent cell death was blocked by inhibition of the kinase activity of RIP1. Furthermore, gemcitabine co-treatment strongly increased the amount of cells undergoing CD95-induced RIP1-regulated necrosis. Imaging flow cytometry has enabled us to get the quantitative insights into the apoptosis-necroptosis network and reveal that the majority of the cells upon the CD95L/gemcitabine co-treatment undergoes necroptosis. Our data underlie the importance of the quantitative understanding of the interplay between different cell death modalities, which is essential for the development of anti-cancer therapies. Taken together, our results are important for combination therapy of pancreatic cancer comprising chemotherapeutics and DR-agonists and offer a possibility to sensitize cells with defects in the apoptotic machinery towards necroptosis-type-mediated death.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation at the C-5 position of cytosine (5mC) regulates gene expression and plays pivotal roles in various biological processes. The TET dioxygenases catalyze iterative oxidation of 5mC, leading to eventual demethylation. Inactivation of TET enzymes causes multistage developmental defects, impaired cell reprogramming, and hematopoietic malignancies. However, little is known about how TET activity is regulated. Here we show that all three TET proteins bind to VprBP and are monoubiquitylated by the VprBP-DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4VprBP) on a highly conserved lysine residue. Deletion of VprBP in oocytes abrogated paternal DNA hydroxymethylation in zygotes. VprBP-mediated monoubiquitylation promotes TET binding to chromatin. Multiple recurrent TET2-inactivating mutations derived from leukemia target either the monoubiquitylation site (K1299) or residues essential for VprBP binding. Cumulatively, our data demonstrate that CRL4VprBP is a critical regulator of TET dioxygenases during development and in tumor suppression.

Abstract: Muscular dystrophies are among major inherited muscle disorders characterized by progressive muscle damage and fibrosis with no definitive cure. Recently, gene or cell based therapies have been developed to restore the missing gene expression or replace the damaged tissues. In order to test the efficiency of these therapies in mice models of muscular dystrophies, the arterial route of delivery is very advantageous as it provides uniform muscle exposure to the therapeutic agents or cells. Although there are few reports of arterial delivery of the therapeutic agents or cells in mice, there is no in-depth description and evaluation of its efficacy in perfusion of downstream muscles. This study is aimed to develop a practical method for intra-femoral artery perfusion in mice and to evaluate perfusion efficiency using near-infrared-fluorescence (NIRF) imaging as well as histology following stem cell delivery. Our results provide a practical guide to perform this delicate method in mice. By using a sensitive fluorescent dye, different muscle groups of the hindlimb have been evaluated for proper perfusion. As the final step, we have validated the efficiency of arterial cell delivery into muscles using human iPS-derived myogenic cells in an immunodeficient mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (NSG-mdx4cv).

Abstract: Summary
Dectin-1, the receptor for β-glucans, protects the host against fungal infection; however, its role in intestinal immunity is incompletely understood. We found that Dectin-1-deficient (Clec7a−/−) mice were refractory to both dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)- and CD45RBhighCD4+ T cell-induced colitis, and that this resistance was associated with an increase in regulatory T (Treg) cells. The proportion of lactobacilli, especially Lactobacillus murinus, in the commensal microflora was increased in Clec7a−/− mouse colons, and accompanied by a decrease in antimicrobial peptides induced by Dectin-1 signaling. L. murinus colonization increased Treg cells in the colon. Oral administration of laminarin, a Dectin-1 antagonist, suppressed the development of DSS-colitis, associated with an increase of L. murinus and Treg cells. Human patients with inflammatory bowel disease were found to have a decreased proportion of closely related Lactobacillus species. These observations suggest that Dectin-1 regulates the homeostasis of intestinal immunity by controlling Treg cell differentiation through modification of microbiota.

Homozygous loss of mouse tetraspanin CD82 enhances integrin αIIbβ3 expression and clot retraction in platelets,

Abstract: Integrin αIIbβ3 is critical for platelet-mediated blood clotting. Tetraspanins are well-established regulators of integrins and genetic loss of tetraspanin CD151 or TSSC6 in mice leads to increased bleeding due to inadequate integrin αIIbβ3 outside-in signaling. Conversely, mild but enhanced integrin αIIbβ3 activation and hyperaggregation is observed in CD9 and CD63 null mice respectively. CD82 is reportedly expressed in platelets; however its function is unknown. Using genetically engineered CD82 null mice, we investigated the role of the tetraspanin CD82 in platelet activation. Loss of CD82 resulted in reduced bleed times in vivo. CD82 was present on the surface of both human and mouse platelets, and its levels did not change upon platelet activation or degranulation. No differences in platelet activation, degranulation, or aggregation in response to ADP or collagen were detected in CD82 null mice. However, the kinetics of clot retraction was enhanced, which was intrinsic to the CD82-null platelets. Integrin αIIbβ3 surface expression was elevated on the platelets from CD82 null mice and they displayed enhanced adhesion and tyrosine kinase signaling on fibrinogen. This is the first report on CD82 function in platelets; which we found intrinsically modulates clot retraction, integrin αIIbβ3 expression, cell adhesion, and tyrosine signaling.

Abstract: Summary
SLX4, a coordinator of multiple DNA structure-specific endonucleases, is important for several DNA repair pathways. Noncovalent interactions of SLX4 with ubiquitin are required for localizing SLX4 to DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), yet how SLX4 is targeted to other functional contexts remains unclear. Here, we show that SLX4 binds SUMO-2/3 chains via SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). The SIMs of SLX4 are dispensable for ICL repair but important for processing CPT-induced replication intermediates, suppressing fragile site instability, and localizing SLX4 to ALT telomeres. The localization of SLX4 to laser-induced DNA damage also requires the SIMs, as well as DNA end resection, UBC9, and MDC1. Furthermore, the SUMO binding of SLX4 enhances its interaction with specific DNA-damage sensors or telomere-binding proteins, including RPA, MRE11-RAD50-NBS1, and TRF2. Thus, the interactions of SLX4 with SUMO and ubiquitin increase its affinity for factors recognizing different DNA lesions or telomeres, helping to direct the SLX4 complex in distinct functional contexts.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium sporozoites are deposited in the host skin by Anopheles mosquitoes. The parasites migrate from the dermis to the liver, where they invade hepatocytes through a moving junction (MJ) to form a replicative parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Malaria sporozoites need to traverse cells during progression through host tissues, a process requiring parasite perforin-like protein 1 (PLP1). We find that sporozoites traverse cells inside transient vacuoles that precede PV formation. Sporozoites initially invade cells inside transient vacuoles by an active MJ-independent process that does not require vacuole membrane remodeling or release of parasite secretory organelles typically involved in invasion. Sporozoites use pH sensing and PLP1 to exit these vacuoles and avoid degradation by host lysosomes. Next, parasites enter the MJ-dependent PV, which has a different membrane composition, precluding lysosome fusion. The malaria parasite has thus evolved different strategies to evade host cell defense and establish an intracellular niche for replication.

Abstract: Summary
Multi-organ failure contributes to mortality in bacterial sepsis. Platelet and immune cell activation contribute to organ injury during sepsis, but the mechanisms by which bacterial virulence factors initiate these responses remain poorly defined. We demonstrate that during lethal sepsis, Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin simultaneously alters platelet activation and promotes neutrophil inflammatory signaling through interactions with its cellular receptor ADAM10. Platelet intoxication prevents endothelial barrier repair and facilitates formation of injurious platelet-neutrophil aggregates, contributing to lung and liver injury that is mitigated by ADAM10 deletion on platelets and myeloid lineage cells. While platelet- or myeloid-specific ADAM10 knockout does not alter sepsis mortality, double-knockout animals are highly protected. These results define a pathway by which a single bacterial toxin utilizes a widely expressed receptor to coordinate progressive, multi-organ disease in lethal sepsis. As an expression-enhancing ADAM10 polymorphism confers susceptibility to severe human sepsis, these studies highlight the importance of understanding molecular host-microbe interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Changes in basal ganglia plasticity at the corticostriatal and thalamostriatal levels are required for motor learning. Endocannabinoid-dependent long-term depression (eCB-LTD) is known to be a dominant form of synaptic plasticity expressed at these glutamatergic inputs; however, whether eCB-LTD can be induced at all inputs on all striatal neurons is still debatable. Using region-specific Cre mouse lines combined with optogenetic techniques, we directly investigated and distinguished between corticostriatal and thalamostriatal projections. We found that eCB-LTD was successfully induced at corticostriatal synapses, independent of postsynaptic striatal spiny projection neuron (SPN) subtype. Conversely, eCB-LTD was only nominally present at thalamostriatal synapses. This dichotomy was attributable to the minimal expression of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors on thalamostriatal terminals. Furthermore, coactivation of dopamine receptors on SPNs during LTD induction re-established SPN-subtype-dependent eCB-LTD. Altogether, our findings lay the groundwork for understanding corticostriatal and thalamostriatal synaptic plasticity and for striatal eCB-LTD in motor learning.

Posttranscriptional regulation in eukaryotes requires cis- and trans-acting features and factors including RNA secondary structure and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). However, a comprehensive view of the structural and RBP interaction landscape of nuclear RNAs has yet to be compiled for any organism. Here, we use our ribonuclease-mediated structure and RBP-binding site mapping approaches to globally profile these features in Arabidopsis seedling nuclei in vivo. We reveal anticorrelated patterns of secondary structure and RBP binding throughout nuclear mRNAs that demarcate sites of alternative splicing and polyadenylation. We also uncover a collection of protein-bound sequence motifs, and identify their structural contexts, co-occurrences in transcripts encoding functionally related proteins, and interactions with putative RBPs. Finally, using these motifs, we find that the chloroplast RBP CP29A also interacts with nuclear mRNAs. In total, we provide a simultaneous view of the RNA secondary structure and RBP interaction landscapes in a eukaryotic nucleus.

Abstract: Summary
Pluripotency represents a cell state comprising a fine-tuned pattern of transcription factor activity required for embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal. TBX3 is the earliest expressed member of the T-box transcription factor family and is involved in maintenance and induction of pluripotency. Hence, TBX3 is believed to be a key member of the pluripotency circuitry, with loss of TBX3 coinciding with loss of pluripotency. We report a dynamic expression of TBX3 in vitro and in vivo using genetic reporter tools tracking TBX3 expression in mouse ESCs (mESCs). Low TBX3 levels are associated with reduced pluripotency, resembling the more mature epiblast. Notably, TBX3-low cells maintain the intrinsic capability to switch to a TBX3-high state and vice versa. Additionally, we show TBX3 to be dispensable for induction and maintenance of naive pluripotency as well as for germ cell development. These data highlight novel facets of TBX3 action in mESCs.

Abstract: Summary
Epigenetic mechanisms can be influenced by environmental cues and thus evoke phenotypic variation. This plasticity can be advantageous for adaptation but also detrimental if not tightly controlled. Although having attracted considerable interest, it remains largely unknown if and how environmental cues such as temperature trigger epigenetic alterations. Using fission yeast, we demonstrate that environmentally induced discontinuous phenotypic variation is buffered by a negative feedback loop that involves the RNase Dicer and the protein disaggregase Hsp104. In the absence of Hsp104, Dicer accumulates in cytoplasmic inclusions and heterochromatin becomes unstable at elevated temperatures, an epigenetic state inherited for many cell divisions after the heat stress. Loss of Dicer leads to toxic aggregation of an exogenous prionogenic protein. Our results highlight the importance of feedback regulation in building epigenetic memory and uncover Hsp104 and Dicer as homeostatic controllers that buffer environmentally induced stochastic epigenetic variation and toxic aggregation of prionogenic proteins.

Abstract: Vitamin C is an antioxidant that plays a vital role in various biological processes including bone formation. Previously, we reported that vitamin C is transported into bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) through the sodium dependent Vitamin C Transporter 2 (SVCT2) and this transporter plays an important role in osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, this transporter is regulated by oxidative stress. To date, however, the exact role of vitamin C and its transporter (SVCT2) in ROS regulated autophagy and apoptosis in BMSCs is poorly understood. In the present study, we observed that oxidative stress decreased survival of BMSCs in a dose-dependent manner and induced growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These effects were accompanied by the induction of autophagy, confirmed by P62 and LC3B protein level and punctate GFP-LC3B distribution. The supplementation of vitamin C significantly rescued the BMSCs from oxidative stress by regulating autophagy. Knockdown of the SVCT2 transporter in BMSCs synergistically decreased cell survival even under low oxidative stress conditions. Also, supplementing vitamin C failed to rescue cells from stress. Our results reveal that the SVCT2 transporter plays a vital role in the mechanism of BMSC survival under stress conditions. Altogether, this study has given new insight into the role of the SVCT2 transporter in oxidative stress related autophagy and apoptosis in BMSCs.

Abstract: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the rat lumbar dorsal horn and in the parvocellularis part of the paraventricular nucleus can be used to visualize neuronal activity. pERK1/2 fluorescence-immunohistochemistry is specifically suited to mirror neuronal activity in the pain pathway following an acute noxious stimulation. The rat hind paw was either stimulated by noxious heat or by a sequence of mustard oil and noxious heat. Two and 10min after the thermal stimulation a 3–4-fold increase in cells with pERK1/2 immunoreactivity was observed in lamina I/II of the L3-L5 dorsal horn. The combination of mustard oil with heat led to a 5–6-fold increase in the pERK1/2 signal. The pERK1/2 immunoreactivity in the parvocellularis part of the paraventricular nucleus increased by 2-fold following the heat stimulus, with no further increase following the sequential mustard oil and heat stimulus. A pretreatment with the opioid analgesic morphine or the NMDA antagonist MK-801 markedly attenuated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in both areas of the pain pathway. The present findings support the concept that the pERK1/2 immunofluorescence signal can be used as a quantitative marker for sensitization or inhibition in the pain pathway at spinal and hypothalamic level.

Abstract: Summary
The CNS contains many diverse neuronal subtypes, and most neurological diseases target specific subtypes. However, the mechanism of neuronal subtype specificity of disease phenotypes remains elusive. Although in vitro disease models employing human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have great potential to clarify the association of neuronal subtypes with disease, it is currently difficult to compare various PSC-derived subtypes. This is due to the limited number of subtypes whose induction is established, and different cultivation protocols for each subtype. Here, we report a culture system to control the regional identity of PSC-derived neurons along the anteroposterior (A-P) and dorsoventral (D-V) axes. This system was successfully used to obtain various neuronal subtypes based on the same protocol. Furthermore, we reproduced subtype-specific phenotypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by comparing the obtained subtypes. Therefore, our culture system provides new opportunities for modeling neurological diseases with PSCs.

Abstract: The spatial distribution of mast cells inside the tumor stroma has been little investigated. In this study, we have evaluated tumor mast cells distribution through the analysis of the morphological features of the spatial patterns generated by these cells, including size, shape, and architecture of the cell pattern. We have compared diffuse large B cells lymphoma (DLBCL) and systemic mastocytosis in two different anatomical localizations (lymph nodes for DLBCL and, respectively, bone marrow for mastocytosis). Results have indicated that, despite the high difference in size exhibited by the mast cells patterns in the two conditions, the spatial relationship between the mast cells forming the aggregates resulted similar, characterized by a significant tendency of the mast cells to self-organize in clusters.

Abstract: Invasion of tissues by Entamoeba histolytica is a multistep process that initiates with the adhesion of the parasite to target tissues. The recognition of the non-invasive Entamoeba dispar as a distinct, but closely related protozoan species raised the question as to whether the lack of its pathogenic potential could be related to a weaker adhesion due to limited cytoskeleton restructuring capacity. We here compared the adhesion process of both amebas to fibronectin through scanning, transmission, atomic force, and confocal microscopy. In addition, electrophoretic and western blot assays of actin were also compared. Adhesion of E. histolytica to fibronectin involves a dramatic reorganization of the actin network that results in a tighter contact to and the subsequent focal degradation of the fibronectin matrix. In contrast, E. dispar showed no regions of focal adhesion, the cytoskeleton was poorly reorganized and there was little fibronectin degradation. In addition, atomic force microscopy using topographic, error signal and phase modes revealed clear-cut differences at the site of contact of both amebas with the substrate. In spite of the morphological and genetic similarities between E. histolytica and E. dispar the present results demonstrate striking differences in their respective cell-to-matrix adhesion processes, which may be of relevance for understanding the invasive character of E. histolytica.

Abstract: Classic semiquantitative proteomic methods have shown that all organisms respond to a mild heat shock by an apparent massive accumulation of a small set of proteins, named heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and a concomitant slowing down in the synthesis of the other proteins. Yet unexplained, the increased levels of HSP messenger RNAs (mRNAs) may exceed 100 times the ensuing relative levels of HSP proteins. We used here high-throughput quantitative proteomics and targeted mRNA quantification to estimate in human cell cultures the mass and copy numbers of the most abundant proteins that become significantly accumulated, depleted, or unchanged during and following 4 h at 41 °C, which we define as mild heat shock. This treatment caused a minor across-the-board mass loss in many housekeeping proteins, which was matched by a mass gain in a few HSPs, predominantly cytosolic HSPCs (HSP90s) and HSPA8 (HSC70). As the mRNAs of the heat-depleted proteins were not significantly degraded and less ribosomes were recruited by excess new HSP mRNAs, the mild depletion of the many housekeeping proteins during heat shock was attributed to their slower replenishment. This differential protein expression pattern was reproduced by isothermal treatments with Hsp90 inhibitors. Unexpectedly, heat-treated cells accumulated 55 times more new molecules of HSPA8 (HSC70) than of the acknowledged heat-inducible isoform HSPA1A (HSP70), implying that when expressed as net copy number differences, rather than as mere “fold change” ratios, new biologically relevant information can be extracted from quantitative proteomic data. Raw data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001666.

Abstract: Summary
The lysosome is the final destination for degradation of endocytic cargo, plasma membrane constituents, and intracellular components sequestered by macroautophagy. Fusion of endosomes and autophagosomes with the lysosome depends on the GTPase Rab7 and the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex, but adaptor proteins that link endocytic and autophagy pathways with lysosomes are poorly characterized. Herein, we show that Pleckstrin homology domain containing protein family member 1 (PLEKHM1) directly interacts with HOPS complex and contains a LC3-interacting region (LIR) that mediates its binding to autophagosomal membranes. Depletion of PLEKHM1 blocks lysosomal degradation of endocytic (EGFR) cargo and enhances presentation of MHC class I molecules. Moreover, genetic loss of PLEKHM1 impedes autophagy flux upon mTOR inhibition and PLEKHM1 regulates clearance of protein aggregates in an autophagy- and LIR-dependent manner. PLEKHM1 is thus a multivalent endocytic adaptor involved in the lysosome fusion events controlling selective and nonselective autophagy pathways.

Abstract: Summary
The quantitative analysis of cardiomyocyte function is essential for stem cell-based approaches for the in vitro study of human cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. We present a method to comprehensively assess the function of single human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hPSC-CMs) through simultaneous quantitative analysis of contraction kinetics, force generation, and electrical activity. We demonstrate that statistical analysis of movies of contracting hPSC-CMs can be used to quantify changes in cellular morphology over time and compute contractile kinetics. Using a biomechanical model that incorporates substrate stiffness, we calculate cardiomyocyte force generation at single-cell resolution and validate this approach with conventional traction force microscopy. The addition of fluorescent calcium indicators or membrane potential dyes allows the simultaneous analysis of contractility and calcium handling or action potential morphology. Accordingly, our approach has the potential for broad application in the study of cardiac disease, drug discovery, and cardiotoxicity screening.

Cell protrusions induced by hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) resemble mesothelial microvilli and share cytoskeletal features of filopodia,

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that overexpression of enzymatically active GFP-HAS induces the growth of long, slender protrusions that share many features of both filopodia and microvilli. These protrusions are dependent on continuing hyaluronan synthesis, and disrupt upon digestion of hyaluronan by hyaluronidase. However, complete understanding of their nature is still missing. This work shows that the protrusions on rat peritoneal surface are ultrastructurally indistinguishable from those induced by GFP-HAS3 in MCF-7 cells. Analysis of the actin-associated proteins villin, ezrin, espin, fascin, and Myo10 indicated that the HAS3-induced protrusions share most cytoskeletal features with filopodia, but they do not require adherence to the substratum like traditional filopodia. GFP-HAS3 overexpression was found to markedly enhance filamentous actin in the protrusions and their cortical basis. Analysis of the protrusion dynamics after enzymatic digestion of hyaluronan revealed that while GFP-HAS3 escape from the protrusions and the protrusion collapse takes place immediately, the complete retraction of the protrusions occurs more slowly. This finding also suggests that hyaluronan chain maintains HAS3 in the plasma membrane. The results of this work suggest that protrusions similar to those of HAS3 overexpressing cells in vitro exist also in cells with active hyaluronan synthesis in vivo. These protrusions are similar to common filopodia but are independent of substratum attachment due to the extracellular scaffolding by the hyaluronan coat that accounts for the growth and maintenance of these structures, previously associated to invasion, adhesion and multidrug resistance.

Abstract: The insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) gene is aberrantly expressed in tumors as a result of loss of imprinting (LOI). Reactivation of the normally-suppressed maternal allele may lead to IGF2 upregulation and increased tumor growth, particularly in colon cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying IGF2 LOI in tumors are poorly defined. In this report, we identified polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) docking factor SUZ12 as a critical factor in regulating IGF2 imprinting in tumors. Human colon cancer cell lines (HRT18 and HT29) show loss of IGF2 imprinting. Ectopic expression of SUZ12 restored normal monoallelic expression of IGF2 in these two colon cancer cell lines. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and chromatin conformation capture (3C), we found that the virally-expressed SUZ12 bound to IGF2 promoters, coordinating with endogenous CTCF to orchestrate a long range intrachromosomal loop between the imprinting control region (ICR) and the IGF2 promoters. The histone methyltransferase EZH2 was recruited to the IGF2 promoters, where it induced H3K27 hypermethylation, suppressing one allele, leading to the restoration of IGF2 imprinting. These data demonstrate that SUZ12 is a key molecule in the regulation of monoallelic expression of IGF2, suggesting a novel epigenetic therapeutic strategy for modulating IGF2 production in human tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription-factor-induced somatic cell conversions are highly relevant for both basic and clinical research yet their mechanism is not fully understood and it is unclear whether they reflect normal differentiation processes. Here we show that during pre-B-cell-to-macrophage transdifferentiation, C/EBPα binds to two types of myeloid enhancers in B cells: pre-existing enhancers that are bound by PU.1, providing a platform for incoming C/EBPα; and de novo enhancers that are targeted by C/EBPα, acting as a pioneer factor for subsequent binding by PU.1. The order of factor binding dictates the upregulation kinetics of nearby genes. Pre-existing enhancers are broadly active throughout the hematopoietic lineage tree, including B cells. In contrast, de novo enhancers are silent in most cell types except in myeloid cells where they become activated by C/EBP factors. Our data suggest that C/EBPα recapitulates physiological developmental processes by short-circuiting two macrophage enhancer pathways in pre-B cells.

Abstract: Summary
The ancient UbiB protein kinase-like family is involved in isoprenoid lipid biosynthesis and is implicated in human diseases, but demonstration of UbiB kinase activity has remained elusive for unknown reasons. Here, we quantitatively define UbiB-specific sequence motifs and reveal their positions within the crystal structure of a UbiB protein, ADCK3. We find that multiple UbiB-specific features are poised to inhibit protein kinase activity, including an N-terminal domain that occupies the typical substrate binding pocket and a unique A-rich loop that limits ATP binding by establishing an unusual selectivity for ADP. A single alanine-to-glycine mutation of this loop flips this coenzyme selectivity and enables autophosphorylation but inhibits coenzyme Q biosynthesis in vivo, demonstrating functional relevance for this unique feature. Our work provides mechanistic insight into UbiB enzyme activity and establishes a molecular foundation for further investigation of how UbiB family proteins affect diseases and diverse biological pathways.

Abstract: Summary
C/EBPα is a critical transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis. How C/EBPα transcription is itself regulated is poorly understood, however, and remains a key question that needs to be addressed for a complete understanding of adipogenic development. Here, we identify a lncRNA, ADINR (adipogenic differentiation induced noncoding RNA), transcribed from a position ∼450 bp upstream of the C/EBPα gene, that orchestrates C/EBPα transcription in vivo. Depletion of ADINR leads to a severe adipogenic defect that is rescued by overexpression of C/EBPα. Moreover, we reveal that ADINR RNA specifically binds to PA1 and recruits MLL3/4 histone methyl-transferase complexes so as to increase H3K4me3 and decrease H3K27me3 histone modification in the C/EBPα locus during adipogenesis. These results show that ADINR plays important roles in regulating the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes by modulating C/EBPα in cis.
