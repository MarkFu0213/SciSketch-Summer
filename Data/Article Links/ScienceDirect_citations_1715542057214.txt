Abstract: Summary
Commensal bacteria shape the colonic regulatory T (Treg) cell population required for intestinal tolerance. However, little is known about this process. Here, we use the transfer of naive commensal-reactive transgenic T cells expressing colonic Treg T cell receptors (TCRs) to study peripheral Treg (pTreg) cell development in normal hosts. We found that T cells were activated primarily in the distal mesenteric lymph node. Treg cell induction was rapid, generating >40% Foxp3+ cells 1 week after transfer. Contrary to prior reports, Foxp3+ cells underwent the most cell divisions, demonstrating that pTreg cell generation can be the dominant outcome from naive T cell activation. Moreover, Notch2-dependent, but not Batf3-dependent, dendritic cells were involved in Treg cell selection. Finally, neither deletion of the conserved nucleotide sequence 1 (CNS1) region in Foxp3 nor blockade of TGF-β (transforming growth factor-β)-receptor signaling completely abrogated Foxp3 induction. Thus, these data show that pTreg cell selection to commensal bacteria is rapid, is robust, and may be specified by TGF-β-independent signals.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanism of cancer metastasis remains poorly understood. Using gene profiling of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, we have identified GOLM1 as a leading gene relating to HCC metastasis. GOLM1 expression is correlated with early recurrence, metastasis, and poor survival of HCC patients. Both gain- and loss-of-function studies determine that GOLM1 acts as a key oncogene by promoting HCC growth and metastasis. It selectively interacts with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and serves as a specific cargo adaptor to assist EGFR/RTK anchoring on the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and recycling back to the plasma membrane, leading to prolonged activation of the downstream kinases. These findings reveal the functional role of GOLM1, a Golgi-related protein, in EGFR/RTK recycling and metastatic progression of HCC.

Abstract: Summary
CD4 and CD8 T cells play a pivotal role in controlling tumor growth. However, the interplay of both cell types and their role in tumor suppression still remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the regulation of CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to different classes of tumor-specific antigens in liver cancer mouse models. Tumors were induced in p19Arf-deficient mice by hydrodynamic injection of transposon plasmids encoding NrasG12V and pre-defined tumor antigens. This allowed for assessing the regulation of tumor-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. We showed that MHC class I tumor immunogenicity was essential to trigger tumor-directed CD4 T cells. Tumor-specific CD8 T cell responses arose independently of CD4 T cells, but they required Th1-polarized CD4 T cells for efficient tumor suppression. Our results further indicate that the immune system is incapable of eliciting sufficient numbers of T cells directed against antigens derived from immunoedited tumors, which consequently leads to a lack of T-cell-mediated tumor suppression in untreated hosts.

Abstract: Summary
In many organisms, hydroxyurea (HU) inhibits class I ribonucleotide reductase, leading to lowered cellular pools of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The reduced levels for DNA precursors is believed to cause replication fork stalling. Upon treatment of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus with HU, we observe dose-dependent cell cycle arrest, accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks, stalled replication forks, and elevated levels of recombination structures. However, Sulfolobus has a HU-insensitive class II ribonucleotide reductase, and we reveal that HU treatment does not significantly impact cellular DNA precursor pools. Profiling of protein and transcript levels reveals modulation of a specific subset of replication initiation and cell division genes. Notably, the selective loss of the regulatory subunit of the primase correlates with cessation of replication initiation and stalling of replication forks. Furthermore, we find evidence for a detoxification response induced by HU treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The complexity of liver tumorigenesis is underscored by the recently observed anti-oncogenic effects of oncoproteins, although the mechanisms are unclear. Shp2/Ptpn11 is a proto-oncogene in hematopoietic cells and antagonizes the effect of tumor suppressor Pten in leukemogenesis. In contrast, we show here cooperative functions of Shp2 and Pten in suppressing hepatocarcinogenesis. Ablating both Shp2 and Pten in hepatocytes induced early-onset non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and promoted genesis of liver tumor-initiating cells likely due to augmented cJun expression/activation and elevated ROS and inflammation in the hepatic microenvironment. Inhibiting cJun partially suppressed NASH-driven liver tumorigenesis without improving NASH. SHP2 and PTEN deficiencies were detected in liver cancer patients with poor prognosis. These data depict a mechanism of hepato-oncogenesis and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
Cytokinesis, the final step of cell division, begins with the formation of a cleavage furrow. How the mitotic spindle specifies the furrow at the equator in animal cells remains unknown. Current models propose that the concentration of the RhoGEF ECT2 at the spindle midzone and the equatorial plasma membrane directs furrow formation. Using chemical genetic and optogenetic tools, we demonstrate that the association of ECT2 with the plasma membrane during anaphase is required and sufficient for cytokinesis. Local membrane targeting of ECT2 leads to unilateral furrowing, highlighting the importance of local ECT2 activity. ECT2 mutations that prevent centralspindlin binding compromise concentration of ECT2 at the midzone and equatorial membrane but sustain cytokinesis. While the association of ECT2 with the plasma membrane is essential for cytokinesis, our data suggest that ECT2 recruitment to the spindle midzone is insufficient to account for equatorial furrowing and may act redundantly with yet-uncharacterized signals.

Abstract: Summary
The repair outcomes at site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 determine how gene function is altered. Despite the widespread adoption of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to induce DSBs for genome engineering, the resulting repair products have not been examined in depth. Here, the DNA repair profiles of 223 sites in the human genome demonstrate that the pattern of DNA repair following Cas9 cutting at each site is nonrandom and consistent across experimental replicates, cell lines, and reagent delivery methods. Furthermore, the repair outcomes are determined by the protospacer sequence rather than genomic context, indicating that DNA repair profiling in cell lines can be used to anticipate repair outcomes in primary cells. Chemical inhibition of DNA-PK enabled dissection of the DNA repair profiles into contributions from c-NHEJ and MMEJ. Finally, this work elucidates a strategy for using “error-prone” DNA-repair machinery to generate precise edits.

Abstract: Summary
Intratumoral heterogeneity is a hallmark of glioblastoma multiforme and thought to negatively affect treatment efficacy. Here, we establish libraries of glioma-initiating cell (GIC) clones from patient samples and find extensive molecular and phenotypic variability among clones, including a range of responses to radiation and drugs. This widespread variability was observed as a continuum of multitherapy resistance phenotypes linked to a proneural-mesenchymal shift in the transcriptome. Multitherapy resistance was associated with a semi-stable cell state that was characterized by an altered DNA methylation pattern at promoter regions of mesenchymal master regulators and enhancers. The gradient of cell states within the GIC compartment constitutes a distinct form of heterogeneity. Our findings may open an avenue toward the development of new therapeutic rationales designed to reverse resistant cell states.

Abstract: Summary
Vertebrate cells can initiate ciliogenesis from centrioles at the cell center, near the Golgi, forming primary cilia confined or submerged in a deep narrow pit created by membrane invagination. How or why cells maintain submerged cilia is unclear. Here, by characterizing centriole subdistal appendages (sDAP) in cells exclusively growing submerged cilia, we found that a group of sDAP components localize to the centriole proximal end through the cohesion factor C-Nap1 and that sDAP function redundantly with C-Nap1 for submerged cilia maintenance. Loss of sDAP and C-Nap1 has no effect on cilia assembly, but it disrupts stable Golgi-cilia association and allows normally submerged cilia to fully surface, losing the deep membrane invagination. Intriguingly, unlike submerged cilia (stationary), surfaced cilia actively respond to mechanical stimuli with motions and can ectopically recruit Hedgehog signaling components in the absence of agonist. We propose that spatial control of ciliogenesis uncouples or specifies sensory properties of cilia.

Abstract: Summary
All mature blood cell types in the adult animal arise from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, the developmental cues regulating HSPC ontogeny are incompletely understood. In particular, the details surrounding a requirement for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the development of mature HSPCs are controversial and difficult to consolidate. Using zebrafish, we demonstrate that Wnt signaling is required to direct an amplification of HSPCs in the aorta. Wnt9a is specifically required for this process and cannot be replaced by Wnt9b or Wnt3a. This proliferative event occurs independently of initial HSPC fate specification, and the Wnt9a input is required prior to aorta formation. HSPC arterial amplification occurs prior to seeding of secondary hematopoietic tissues and proceeds, in part, through the cell cycle regulator myca (c-myc). Our results support a general paradigm, in which early signaling events, including Wnt, direct later HSPC developmental processes.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity is a major risk factor driving the global type II diabetes pandemic. However, the molecular factors linking obesity to disease remain to be elucidated. Gender differences are apparent in humans and are also observed in murine models. Here, we link these differences to expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), which, upon HFD feeding, becomes significantly reduced in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of male but not female mice. Strikingly, restoring 4E-BP1 expression in male mice protects them against HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Male 4E-BP1 transgenic mice also exhibit reduced white adipose tissue accumulation accompanied by decreased circulating levels of leptin and triglycerides. Importantly, transgenic 4E-BP1 male mice are also protected from aging-induced obesity and metabolic decline on a normal diet. These results demonstrate that 4E-BP1 is a gender-specific suppressor of obesity that regulates insulin sensitivity and energy metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
To maintain energy homeostasis despite variable energy supply and consumption along the diurnal cycle, the liver relies on a circadian clock synchronized to food timing. Perturbed feeding and fasting cycles have been associated with clock disruption and metabolic diseases; however, the mechanisms are unclear. To address this question, we have constructed a mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock, incorporating the metabolic sensors SIRT1 and AMPK. The clock response to various temporal patterns of AMPK activation was simulated numerically, mimicking the effects of a normal diet, fasting, and a high-fat diet. The model reproduces the dampened clock gene expression and NAD+ rhythms reported for mice on a high-fat diet and predicts that this effect may be pharmacologically rescued by timed REV-ERB agonist administration. Our model thus identifies altered AMPK signaling as a mechanism leading to clock disruption and its associated metabolic effects and suggests a pharmacological approach to resetting the clock in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Twist has been shown to cause treatment failure, cancer progression, and cancer-related death. However, strategies that directly target Twist are not yet conceivable. Here we reveal that K63-linked ubiquitination is a crucial regulatory mechanism for Twist activation. Through an E3 ligase screen and biochemical studies, we unexpectedly identified that RNF8 functions as a direct Twist activator by triggering K63-linked ubiquitination of Twist. RNF8-promoted Twist ubiquitination is required for Twist localization to the nucleus for subsequent EMT and CSC functions, thereby conferring chemoresistance. Our histological analyses showed that RNF8 expression is upregulated and correlated with disease progression, EMT features, and poor patient survival in breast cancer. Moreover, RNF8 regulates cancer cell migration and invasion and cancer metastasis, recapitulating the effect of Twist. Together, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized tumor-promoting function of RNF8 and provide evidence that targeting RNF8 is an appealing strategy to tackle tumor aggressiveness and treatment resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Following moving visual stimuli (conditioning stimuli, CS), many organisms perceive, in the absence of physical stimuli, illusory motion in the opposite direction. This phenomenon is known as the motion aftereffect (MAE). Here, we use MAE as a tool to study the neuronal basis of visual motion perception in zebrafish larvae. Using zebrafish eye movements as an indicator of visual motion perception, we find that larvae perceive MAE. Blocking eye movements using optogenetics during CS presentation did not affect MAE, but tectal ablation significantly weakened it. Using two-photon calcium imaging of behaving GCaMP3 larvae, we find post-stimulation sustained rhythmic activity among direction-selective tectal neurons associated with the perception of MAE. In addition, tectal neurons tuned to the CS direction habituated, but neurons in the retina did not. Finally, a model based on competition between direction-selective neurons reproduced MAE, suggesting a neuronal circuit capable of generating perception of visual motion.

Abstract: Summary
In mammalian cells, classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) is critical for DNA double-strand break repair induced by ionizing radiation and during V(D)J recombination in developing B and T lymphocytes. Recently, PAXX was identified as a c-NHEJ core component. We report here that PAXX-deficient cells exhibit a cellular phenotype uncharacteristic of a deficiency in c-NHEJ core components. PAXX-deficient cells display normal sensitivity to radiomimetic drugs, are proficient in transient V(D)J recombination assays, and do not shift toward higher micro-homology usage in plasmid repair assays. Although PAXX-deficient cells lack c-NHEJ phenotypes, PAXX forms a stable ternary complex with Ku bound to DNA. Formation of this complex involves an interaction with Ku70 and requires a bare DNA extension for stability. Moreover, the relatively weak Ku-dependent stimulation of LIG4/XRCC4 activity by PAXX is unmasked by XLF ablation. Thus, PAXX plays an accessory role during c-NHEJ that is largely overlapped by XLF’s function.

Abstract: Summary
Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy 2 (BSCL2) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in SEIPIN, a protein implicated in both adipogenesis and lipid droplet expansion but whose molecular function remains obscure. Here, we identify physical and functional interactions between SEIPIN and microsomal isoforms of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) in multiple organisms. Compared to controls, GPAT activity was elevated in SEIPIN-deficient cells and tissues and GPAT kinetic values were altered. Increased GPAT activity appears to underpin the block in adipogenesis and abnormal lipid droplet morphology associated with SEIPIN loss. Overexpression of Gpat3 blocked adipogenesis, and Gpat3 knockdown in SEIPIN-deficient preadipocytes partially restored differentiation. GPAT overexpression in yeast, preadipocytes, and fly salivary glands also formed supersized lipid droplets. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of GPAT in Seipin−/− mouse preadipocytes partially restored adipogenesis. These data identify SEIPIN as an evolutionarily conserved regulator of microsomal GPAT and suggest that GPAT inhibitors might be useful for the treatment of human BSCL2 patients.

Abstract: Ginsenosides, which are the active materials of ginseng, have biological functions that include anti-osteoporotic effects. Aqueous ginseng extract inhibits osteoclast differentiation induced by receptor activator of NF-KB ligand (RANKL). Aqueous ginseng extract produces chromatography peaks characteristic of ginsenosides. Among these peaks, ginsenoside Re is a major component. However, the preventive effects of ginsenoside Re against osteoclast differentiation are not known. We studied the effect of ginsenoside Re on osteoclast differentiation, RANKL- induced tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, and formation of multinucleated osteoclasts in vitro. Ginsenoside Re hampered osteoclast differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. In an in vivo zebrafish model, aqueous ginseng extract and ginsenoside Re had anti- osteoclastogenesis effects. These findings suggest that both aqueous ginseng extract and ginsenoside Re prevent bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclast differentiation. Ginsenoside Re could be important for promoting bone health.

Abstract: Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) utilizes two different cell-cycle modes, binucleations during the L1 larval stage and endoreduplications at four larval moltings, for its postembryonic intestinal development. Previous genetic studies indicated that CDC-25.2 is specifically required for binucleations at the L1 larval stage and is repressed before endoreduplications. Furthermore, LIN-23, the C. elegans β-TrCP ortholog, appears to function as a repressor of CDC-25.2 to prevent excess intestinal divisions. We previously reported that intestinal hyperplasia in lin-23(e1883) mutants was effectively suppressed by the RNAi depletion of cdc-25.2. Nevertheless, LIN-23 targeting CDC-25.2 for ubiquitination as a component of E3 ubiquitin ligase has not yet been tested. In this study, LIN-23 is shown to be the major E3 ubiquitin ligase component, recognizing CDC-25.2 to repress their activities for proper transition of cell-cycle modes during the C. elegans postembryonic intestinal development.

Abstract: CD24 was suggested as a marker to SCAPs and has been reported for a decade. CD24 has been shown to involve stem cell activities such as self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. However, the percentage variations of CD24 positive cells were reported among the studies. It is possible that this variation may affect these SCAPs behaviors. In this study, the variation was confirmed. To elucidate the influence of CD24 positive cells quantity on SCAPs stem cell behaviors, the 3 cell lines with the most maximum and the least numbers of CD24 positive cells (High-CD24 and Low-CD24 group) were selected to study. Both groups expressed the same mesenchymal stem cell markers and negative to hematopoietic marker. High-CD24 group demonstrated less self-renewal capacity by lower colony-forming-unit count and pluripotency marker gene expressions. However, cell proliferation was not different. In contrast, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation were better than Low-CD24 group. The early stage of root development demonstrated higher CD24 expressing cells than later stage. In conclusion, quantity of CD24 expressing cells influenced SCAPs self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation but did not influence on cell proliferation. Stage of root development influenced to CD24 expressing cell numbers.

Abstract: Summary
To identify endogenous miRNA-target sites, we isolated AGO-bound RNAs from Caenorhabditis elegans by individual-nucleotide resolution crosslinking immunoprecipitation (iCLIP), which fortuitously also produced miRNA-target chimeric reads. Through the analysis of thousands of reproducible chimeras, pairing to the miRNA seed emerged as the predominant motif associated with functional interactions. Unexpectedly, we discovered that additional pairing to 3′ sequences is prevalent in the majority of target sites and leads to specific targeting by members of miRNA families. By editing an endogenous target site, we demonstrate that 3′ pairing determines targeting by specific miRNA family members and that seed pairing is not always sufficient for functional target interactions. Finally, we present a simplified method, chimera PCR (ChimP), for the detection of specific miRNA-target interactions. Overall, our analysis revealed that sequences in the 5′ as well as the 3′ regions of a miRNA provide the information necessary for stable and specific miRNA-target interactions in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Cell type specification relies on the capacity of undifferentiated cells to properly respond to specific differentiation-inducing signals. Using genomic approaches along with loss- and gain-of-function genetic models, we identified OCT4-dependent mechanisms that provide embryonic stem cells with the means to customize their response to external cues. OCT4 binds a large set of low-accessible genomic regions. At these sites, OCT4 is required for proper enhancer and gene activation by recruiting co-regulators and RAR:RXR or β-catenin, suggesting an unexpected collaboration between the lineage-determining transcription factor and these differentiation-initiating, signal-dependent transcription factors. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that overexpression of OCT4 in a kidney cell line is sufficient for signal-dependent activation of otherwise unresponsive genes in these cells. Our results uncover OCT4 as an integral and necessary component of signal-regulated transcriptional processes required for tissue-specific responses.

Abstract: Summary
TBK1 is a component of the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, yet the mechanisms controlling its activity and degradation remain poorly understood. Here we report that USP38 negatively regulates type I IFN signaling by targeting the active form of TBK1 for degradation in vitro and in vivo. USP38 specifically cleaves K33-linked poly-ubiquitin chains from TBK1 at Lys670, and it allows for subsequent K48-linked ubiquitination at the same position mediated by DTX4 and TRIP. Knockdown or knockout of USP38 increases K33-linked ubiquitination, but it abrogates K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of TBK1, thus enhancing type I IFN signaling. Our findings identify an essential role for USP38 in negatively regulating type I IFN signaling, and they provide insights into the mechanisms by which USP38 regulates TBK1 ubiquitination through the NLRP4 signalosome.

Abstract: Summary
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an organizer of higher-order chromatin structure and regulates gene expression. Genetic studies have implicated mutations in CTCF in intellectual disabilities. However, the role of CTCF-mediated chromatin structure in learning and memory is unclear. We show that depletion of CTCF in postmitotic neurons, or depletion in the hippocampus of adult mice through viral-mediated knockout, induces deficits in learning and memory. These deficits in learning and memory at the beginning of adulthood are correlated with impaired long-term potentiation and reduced spine density, with no changes in basal synaptic transmission and dendritic morphogenesis and arborization. Cognitive disabilities are associated with downregulation of cadherin and learning-related genes. In addition, CTCF knockdown attenuates fear-conditioning-induced hippocampal gene expression of key learning genes and loss of long-range interactions at the BDNF and Arc loci. This study thus suggests that CTCF-dependent gene expression regulation and genomic organization are regulators of learning and memory.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic receptors gate the neuronal response to incoming signals, but they are not homogeneously distributed on dendrites. A spatially defined receptor distribution can preferentially amplify certain synaptic inputs, resize receptive fields of neurons, and optimize information processing within a neuronal circuit. Thus, a longstanding question is how the spatial organization of synaptic receptors is achieved. Here, we find that action potentials provide local signals that influence the distribution of synaptic AMPA receptors along dendrites in mouse cerebellar stellate cells. Graded dendritic depolarizations elevate CPEB3 protein at proximal dendrites, where we suggest that CPEB3 binds to GluA2 mRNA, suppressing GluA2 protein synthesis leading to a distance-dependent increase in synaptic GluA2 AMPARs. The activity-induced expression of CPEB3 requires increased Ca2+ and PKC activation. Our results suggest a cell-autonomous mechanism where sustained postsynaptic firing drives graded local protein synthesis, thus directing the spatial organization of synaptic AMPARs.

Abstract: Summary
Photoreceptor death is the endpoint of many blinding diseases. Identifying unifying pathogenic mechanisms in these diseases may offer global approaches for facilitating photoreceptor survival. We found that rod or cone photoreceptor-specific deletion of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), the rate-limiting enzyme in the major NAD+ biosynthetic pathway beginning with nicotinamide, caused retinal degeneration. In both cases, we could rescue vision with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Significantly, retinal NAD+ deficiency was an early feature of multiple mouse models of retinal dysfunction, including light-induced degeneration, streptozotocin-induced diabetic retinopathy, and age-associated dysfunction. Mechanistically, NAD+ deficiency caused metabolic dysfunction and consequent photoreceptor death. We further demonstrate that the NAD+-dependent mitochondrial deacylases SIRT3 and SIRT5 play important roles in retinal homeostasis and that NAD+ deficiency causes SIRT3 dysfunction. These findings demonstrate that NAD+ biosynthesis is essential for vision, provide a foundation for future work to further clarify the mechanisms involved, and identify a unifying therapeutic target for diverse blinding diseases.

Abstract: Summary
In cold-blooded vertebrates such as zebrafish, Müller glial cells (MGs) readily proliferate to replenish lost retinal neurons. In mammals, however, MGs lack regenerative capability as they do not spontaneously re-enter the cell cycle unless the retina is injured. Here, we show that gene transfer of β-catenin in adult mouse retinas activates Wnt signaling and MG proliferation without retinal injury. Upstream of Wnt, deletion of GSK3β stabilizes β-catenin and activates MG proliferation. Downstream of Wnt, β-catenin binds to the Lin28 promoter and activates transcription. Deletion of Lin28 abolishes β-catenin-mediated effects on MG proliferation, and Lin28 gene transfer stimulates MG proliferation. We further demonstrate that let-7 miRNAs are critically involved in Wnt/Lin28-regulated MG proliferation. Intriguingly, a subset of cell-cycle-reactivated MGs express markers for amacrine cells. Together, these results reveal a key role of Wnt-Lin28-let7 miRNA signaling in regulating proliferation and neurogenic potential of MGs in the adult mammalian retina.

Abstract: Summary
The murine epidermis with its hair follicles represents an invaluable model system for tissue regeneration and stem cell research. Here we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to reveal how cellular heterogeneity of murine telogen epidermis is tuned at the transcriptional level. Unbiased clustering of 1,422 single-cell transcriptomes revealed 25 distinct populations of interfollicular and follicular epidermal cells. Our data allowed the reconstruction of gene expression programs during epidermal differentiation and along the proximal-distal axis of the hair follicle at unprecedented resolution. Moreover, transcriptional heterogeneity of the epidermis can essentially be explained along these two axes, and we show that heterogeneity in stem cell compartments generally reflects this model: stem cell populations are segregated by spatial signatures but share a common basal-epidermal gene module. This study provides an unbiased and systematic view of transcriptional organization of adult epidermis and highlights how cellular heterogeneity can be orchestrated in vivo to assure tissue homeostasis.

Abstract: The cancer chemo-preventive effects of equol have been demonstrated for a wide variety of experimental tumours. In a previous study, we found that equol inhibited proliferation and induced apoptotic death of human gastric cancer MGC-803 cells. However, the mechanisms underlying equol-mediated apoptosis have not been well understood. In the present study, the dual AO (acridine orange)/EB (ethidium bromide) fluorescent assay, the comet assay, MTS, western blotting and flow cytometric assays were performed to further investigate the pro-apoptotic effect of equol and its associated mechanisms in MGC-803 cells. The results demonstrated that equol induced an apoptotic nuclear morphology revealed by AO/EB staining, the presence of a comet tail, the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP and the depletion of cIAP1, indicating its pro-apoptotic effect. In addition, equol-induced apoptosis involves the mitochondria-dependent cell-death pathway, evidenced by the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, the cleavage of caspase-9 and the depletion of Bcl-xL and full-length Bid. Moreover, treating MGC-803 cells with equol induced the sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and inhibiting ERK by U0126, a MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor, significantly attenuated the equol-induced cell apoptosis. These results suggest that equol induces mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in human gastric cancer MGC-803 cells via the sustained activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Therefore, equol may be a novel candidate for the chemoprevention and therapy of gastric cancer.

Abstract: Cantharidin (CTD) is an active compound isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine blister beetle and displayed anticancer properties against various types of cancer cells. However, little is known about its effect on human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, including imatinib-resistant CML cells. The objective of this study was to investigate whether CTD could overcome imatinib resistance in imatinib-resistant CML cells and to explore the possible underlying mechanisms associated with the effect. Our results showed that CTD strongly inhibited the growth of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells. CTD induced cell cycle arrest at mitotic phase and triggered DNA damage in CML cells. The ATM/ATR inhibitor CGK733 abrogated CTD-induced mitotic arrest but promoted the cytotoxic effects of CTD. In addition, we demonstrated that CTD downregulated the expression of the BCR-ABL protein and suppressed its downstream signal transduction. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that CTD inhibited BCR-ABL at transcriptional level. Knockdown of BCR-ABL increased the cell-killing effects of CTD in K562 cells. These findings indicated that CTD overcomes imatinib resistance through depletion of BCR- ABL. Taken together, CTD is an important new candidate agent for CML therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1) is highly expressed in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). However, the regulatory mechanism responsible for its role in GSCs is poorly understood. Here, we report that ID1 activates GSC proliferation, self-renewal, and tumorigenicity by suppressing CULLIN3 ubiquitin ligase. ID1 induces cell proliferation through increase of CYCLIN E, a target molecule of CULLIN3. ID1 overexpression or CULLIN3 knockdown confers GSC features and tumorigenicity to murine Ink4a/Arf-deficient astrocytes. Proteomics analysis revealed that CULLIN3 interacts with GLI2 and DVL2 and induces their degradation via ubiquitination. Consistent with ID1 knockdown or CULLIN3 overexpression in human GSCs, pharmacologically combined control of GLI2 and β-CATENIN effectively diminishes GSC properties. A ID1-high/CULLIN3-low expression signature correlates with a poor patient prognosis, supporting the clinical relevance of this signaling axis. Taken together, a loss of CULLIN3 represents a common signaling node for controlling the activity of intracellular WNT and SHH signaling pathways mediated by ID1.

Abstract: Summary
Intraflagellar transport sub-complex A (IFT-A) is known to regulate retrograde IFT in the cilium. To rigorously assess its other possible roles, we knocked out an IFT-A subunit, IFT121/WDR35, in mammalian cells and screened the localization of more than 50 proteins. We found that Wdr35 regulates cilium assembly by selectively regulating transport of distinct cargoes. Beyond its role in retrograde transport, we show that Wdr35 functions in fusion of Rab8 vesicles at the nascent cilium, protein exit from the cilium, and centriolar satellite organization. Furthermore, we show that Wdr35 is essential for entry of many membrane proteins into the cilium through robust interactions with cargoes and other IFT-A subunits, but the actin network functions to dampen this transport. Wdr35 is mutated in several ciliopathies, and we find that certain disease mutations impair interactions with cargo and other IFT-A subunits. Together, our data link defects in IFT-A mediated cargo transport with disease.

Abstract: Summary
To establish pathogenicity, bacteria must evade phagocytosis directed by remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. We show that macrophages facilitate pathogen phagocytosis through actin polymerization mediated by the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), small GTPases Arf and Rac1, and the Arf1 activator ARNO. To establish extracellular infections, enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) Escherichia coli hijack the actin cytoskeleton by injecting virulence effectors into the host cell. Here, we find that the virulence effector EspG counteracts WRC-dependent phagocytosis, enabling EPEC and EHEC to remain extracellular. By reconstituting membrane-associated actin polymerization, we find that EspG disabled WRC activation through two mechanisms: EspG interaction with Arf6 blocked signaling to ARNO while EspG binding of Arf1 impeded collaboration with Rac1, thereby inhibiting WRC recruitment and activation. Investigating the mode of EspG interference revealed sites in Arf1 required for WRC activation and a mechanism facilitating pathogen evasion of innate host defenses.

Abstract: Summary
Hypoxia is a universal driver of aggressive tumor behavior, but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Using a phosphoproteomics screen, we now show that active Akt accumulates in the mitochondria during hypoxia and phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) on Thr346 to inactivate the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. In turn, this pathway switches tumor metabolism toward glycolysis, antagonizes apoptosis and autophagy, dampens oxidative stress, and maintains tumor cell proliferation in the face of severe hypoxia. Mitochondrial Akt-PDK1 signaling correlates with unfavorable prognostic markers and shorter survival in glioma patients and may provide an “actionable” therapeutic target in cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The five-subunit yeast Paf1 complex (Paf1C) regulates all stages of transcription and is critical for the monoubiquitylation of histone H2B (H2Bub), a modification that broadly influences chromatin structure and eukaryotic transcription. Here, we show that the histone modification domain (HMD) of Paf1C subunit Rtf1 directly interacts with the ubiquitin conjugase Rad6 and stimulates H2Bub independently of transcription. We present the crystal structure of the Rtf1 HMD and use site-specific, in vivo crosslinking to identify a conserved Rad6 interaction surface. Utilizing ChIP-exo analysis, we define the localization patterns of the H2Bub machinery at high resolution and demonstrate the importance of Paf1C in targeting the Rtf1 HMD, and thereby H2Bub, to its appropriate genomic locations. Finally, we observe HMD-dependent stimulation of H2Bub in a transcription-free, reconstituted in vitro system. Taken together, our results argue for an active role for Paf1C in promoting H2Bub and ensuring its proper localization in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The development of neural connectivity is essential for brain function, and disruption of this process is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). DIX domain containing 1 (DIXDC1) has previously been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, but its role in postnatal brain function remains unknown. Using a knockout mouse model, we determined that DIXDC1 is a regulator of excitatory neuron dendrite development and synapse function in the cortex. We discovered that MARK1, previously linked to ASDs, phosphorylates DIXDC1 to regulate dendrite and spine development through modulation of the cytoskeletal network in an isoform-specific manner. Finally, rare missense variants in DIXDC1 were identified in ASD patient cohorts via genetic sequencing. Interestingly, the variants inhibit DIXDC1 isoform 1 phosphorylation, causing impairment to dendrite and spine growth. These data reveal that DIXDC1 is a regulator of cortical dendrite and synaptic development and provide mechanistic insight into morphological defects associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.

Macrophages are innate immune cells that adopt diverse activation states in response to their microenvironment. Editing macrophage activation to dampen inflammatory diseases by promoting the repolarization of inflammatory (M1) macrophages to anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages is of high interest. Here, we find that mouse and human M1 macrophages fail to convert into M2 cells upon IL-4 exposure in vitro and in vivo. In sharp contrast, M2 macrophages are more plastic and readily repolarized into an inflammatory M1 state. We identify M1-associated inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as the factor responsible for preventing M1→M2 repolarization. Inhibiting nitric oxide production, a key effector molecule in M1 cells, dampens the decline in mitochondrial function to improve metabolic and phenotypic reprogramming to M2 macrophages. Thus, inflammatory macrophage activation blunts oxidative phosphorylation, thereby preventing repolarization. Therapeutically restoring mitochondrial function might be useful to improve the reprogramming of inflammatory macrophages into anti-inflammatory cells to control disease.

Abstract: Summary
Maintenance of cellular homeostasis and xenobiotic detoxification is mediated by 19 human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes (UGTs) encoded by ten genes that comprise the glucuronidation pathway. Deep RNA sequencing of major metabolic organs exposes a substantial expansion of the UGT transcriptome by alternative splicing, with variants representing 20% to 60% of canonical transcript expression. Nearly a fifth of expressed variants comprise in-frame sequences that may create distinct structural and functional features. Follow-up cell-based assays reveal biological functions for these alternative UGT proteins. Some isoforms were found to inhibit or induce inactivation of drugs and steroids in addition to perturbing global cell metabolism (energy, amino acids, nucleotides), cell adhesion, and proliferation. This work highlights the biological relevance of alternative UGT expression, which we propose increases protein diversity through the evolution of metabolic regulators from specific enzymes.

Abstract: Summary
CD4+ T cells develop distinct and often contrasting helper, regulatory, or cytotoxic activities. Typically a property of CD8+ T cells, granzyme-mediated cytotoxic T cell (CTL) potential is also exerted by CD4+ T cells. However, the conditions that induce CD4+ CTLs are not entirely understood. Using single-cell transcriptional profiling, we uncover a unique signature of Granzyme B (GzmB)+ CD4+ CTLs, which distinguishes them from other CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, including Th1 cells, and strongly contrasts with the follicular helper T (Tfh) cell signature. The balance between CD4+ CTL and Tfh differentiation heavily depends on the class of infecting virus and is jointly regulated by the Tfh-related transcription factors Bcl6 and Tcf7 (encoding TCF-1) and by the expression of the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and LAG3. This unique profile of CD4+ CTLs offers targets for their study, and its antagonism by the Tfh program separates CD4+ T cells with either helper or killer functions.

Abstract: Summary
B cell CLL/lymphoma 11A (BCL11A) is a transcription factor and regulator of hemoglobin switching that has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for sickle cell disease and thalassemia. In the hematopoietic system, BCL11A is required for B lymphopoiesis, yet its role in other hematopoietic cells, especially hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains elusive. The extensive expression of BCL11A in hematopoiesis implicates context-dependent roles, highlighting the importance of fully characterizing its function as part of ongoing efforts for stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Here, we demonstrate that BCL11A is indispensable for normal HSC function. Bcl11a deficiency results in HSC defects, typically observed in the aging hematopoietic system. We find that downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (Cdk6), and the ensuing cell-cycle delay, correlate with HSC dysfunction. Our studies define a mechanism for BCL11A in regulation of HSC function and have important implications for the design of therapeutic approaches to targeting BCL11A.

Abstract: Summary
A large population of proliferative stem cells (neoblasts) is required for physiological tissue homeostasis and post-injury regeneration in planarians. Recent studies indicate that survival of a few neoblasts after sublethal irradiation results in the clonal expansion of the surviving stem cells and the eventual restoration of tissue homeostasis and regenerative capacity. However, the precise mechanisms regulating the population dynamics of neoblasts remain largely unknown. Here, we uncovered a central role for epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling during in vivo neoblast expansion mediated by Smed-egfr-3 (egfr-3) and its putative ligand Smed-neuregulin-7 (nrg-7). Furthermore, the EGF receptor-3 protein localizes asymmetrically on the cytoplasmic membrane of neoblasts, and the ratio of asymmetric to symmetric cell divisions decreases significantly in egfr-3(RNAi) worms. Our results not only provide the first molecular evidence of asymmetric stem cell divisions in planarians, but also demonstrate that EGF signaling likely functions as an essential regulator of neoblast clonal expansion.

Abstract: Summary
In the pancreatic islet, serotonin is an autocrine signal increasing beta cell mass during metabolic challenges such as those associated with pregnancy or high-fat diet. It is still unclear whether serotonin is relevant for regular islet physiology and hormone secretion. Here, we show that human beta cells produce and secrete serotonin when stimulated with increases in glucose concentration. Serotonin secretion from beta cells decreases cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in neighboring alpha cells via 5-HT1F receptors and inhibits glucagon secretion. Without serotonergic input, alpha cells lose their ability to regulate glucagon secretion in response to changes in glucose concentration, suggesting that diminished serotonergic control of alpha cells can cause glucose blindness and the uncontrolled glucagon secretion associated with diabetes. Supporting this model, pharmacological activation of 5-HT1F receptors reduces glucagon secretion and has hypoglycemic effects in diabetic mice. Thus, modulation of serotonin signaling in the islet represents a drug intervention opportunity.

Abstract: Summary
In advanced stages of cancers, TGF-β promotes tumor progression in conjunction with inputs from receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. However, mechanisms that underpin the signaling cooperation and convert TGF-β from a potent growth inhibitor to a tumor promoter are not fully understood. We report here that TGF-β directly regulates alternative splicing of cancer stem cell marker CD44 through a phosphorylated T179 of SMAD3-mediated interaction with RNA-binding protein PCBP1. We show that TGF-β and EGF respectively induce SMAD3 and PCBP1 to colocalize in SC35-positive nuclear speckles, and the two proteins interact in the variable exon region of CD44 pre-mRNA to inhibit spliceosome assembly in favor of expressing the mesenchymal isoform CD44s over the epithelial isoform CD44E. We further show that the SMAD3-mediated alternative splicing is essential to the tumor-promoting role of TGF-β and has a global influence on protein products of genes instrumental to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
We identify a type of polycistronic transcript-derived long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are 5′ small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) capped and 3′ polyadenylated (SPAs). SPA processing is associated with nascent mRNA 3′ processing and kinetic competition between XRN2 trimming and Pol II elongation. Following cleavage/polyadenylation of its upstream gene, the downstream uncapped pre-SPA is trimmed by XRN2 until this exonuclease reaches the co-transcriptionally assembled snoRNP. This snoRNP complex prevents further degradation, generates a snoRNA 5′ end, and allows continuous Pol II elongation. The imprinted 15q11-q13 encodes two SPAs that are deleted in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patients. These lncRNAs form a nuclear accumulation that is enriched in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) including TDP43, RBFOX2, and hnRNP M. Generation of a human PWS cellular model by depleting these lncRNAs results in altered patterns of RBPs binding and alternative splicing. Together, these results expand the diversity of lncRNAs and provide additional insights into PWS pathogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Recent evidence suggests that lncRNAs play an integral regulatory role in numerous functions, including determination of cellular identity. We determined global expression (RNA-seq) and genome-wide profiles (ChIP-seq) of histone post-translational modifications and p53 binding in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) undergoing differentiation to define a high-confidence set of 40 lncRNAs, which are p53 transcriptional targets. We focused on lncRNAs highly expressed in pluripotent hESCs and repressed by p53 during differentiation to identify lncPRESS1 as a p53-regulated transcript that maintains hESC pluripotency in concert with core pluripotency factors. RNA-seq of hESCs depleted of lncPRESS1 revealed that lncPRESS1 controls a gene network that promotes pluripotency. Further, we found that lncPRESS1 physically interacts with SIRT6 and prevents SIRT6 chromatin localization, which maintains high levels of histone H3K56 and H3K9 acetylation at promoters of pluripotency genes. In summary, we describe a p53-regulated, pluripotency-specific lncRNA that safeguards the hESC state by disrupting SIRT6 activity.

Abstract: Dental pulp is a highly vascularized tissue requiring adequate blood supply for successful regeneration. In this study, we investigated the functional role of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHEDs) as a perivascular source for in vivo formation of vessel-like structures. Primarily isolated SHEDs showed mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like characteristics including the expression of surface antigens and in vitro osteogenic and adi- pogenic differentiation potentials. Moreover, SHEDs were positive for NG2, а-smooth muscle actin (SMA), platelet- derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ), and CD146 as pericyte markers. To prove feasibility of SHEDs as perivascular source, SHEDs were transplanted into immunodeficient mouse using Matrigel with or without human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Transplantation of SHEDs alone or HUVECs alone resulted in no formation of vessel-like structures with enough red blood cells. However, when SHEDs and HUVECs were transplanted together, extensive vessel-like structures were formed. The presence of murine erythrocytes within lumens suggested the formation of anastomoses between newly formed vessel-like structures in Matrigel plug and the host circulatory system. To understand underlying mechanisms of in vivo angiogenesis, the expression of angiogenic cytokine and chemokine, their receptors, and MMPs was compared between SHEDs and HUVECs. SHEDs showed higher expression of VEGF, SDF-1α, and PDGFRβ than HUVECs. On the contrary, HUVECs showed higher expression of VEGF receptors, CXCR4, and PDGF-BB than SHEDs. This differential expression pattern suggested reciprocal interactions between SHEDs and HUVECs and their involvement during in vivo angiogenesis. In conclusion, SHEDs could be a feasible source of perivascular cells for in vivo angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) guiding differentiation of cell types and cell assemblies in the nervous system are poorly understood because of inherent complexities and interdependence of signaling pathways. Here, we report transcriptome dynamics of differentiating rod photoreceptors in the mammalian retina. Given that the transcription factor NRL determines rod cell fate, we performed expression profiling of developing NRL-positive (rods) and NRL-negative (S-cone-like) mouse photoreceptors. We identified a large-scale, sharp transition in the transcriptome landscape between postnatal days 6 and 10 concordant with rod morphogenesis. Rod-specific temporal DNA methylation corroborated gene expression patterns. De novo assembly and alternative splicing analyses revealed previously unannotated rod-enriched transcripts and the role of NRL in transcript maturation. Furthermore, we defined the relationship of NRL with other transcriptional regulators and downstream cognate effectors. Our studies provide the framework for comprehensive system-level analysis of the GRN underlying the development of a single sensory neuron, the rod photoreceptor.

Abstract: Summary
The uptake of cytoplasmic calcium into mitochondria is critical for a variety of physiological processes, including calcium buffering, metabolism, and cell survival. Here, we demonstrate that inhibiting the mitochondrial calcium uniporter in the Drosophila mushroom body neurons (MBn)—a brain region critical for olfactory memory formation—causes memory impairment without altering the capacity to learn. Inhibiting uniporter activity only during pupation impaired adult memory, whereas the same inhibition during adulthood was without effect. The behavioral impairment was associated with structural defects in MBn, including a decrease in synaptic vesicles and an increased length in the axons of the αβ MBn. Our results reveal an in vivo developmental role for the mitochondrial uniporter complex in establishing the necessary structural and functional neuronal substrates for normal memory formation in the adult organism.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes I, III, and IV associate into a variety of supramolecular structures known as supercomplexes and respirasomes. While COX7A2L was originally described as a supercomplex-specific factor responsible for the dynamic association of complex IV into these structures to adapt MRC function to metabolic variations, this role has been disputed. Here, we further examine the functional significance of COX7A2L in the structural organization of the mammalian respiratory chain. As in the mouse, human COX7A2L binds primarily to free mitochondrial complex III and, to a minor extent, to complex IV to specifically promote the stabilization of the III2+IV supercomplex without affecting respirasome formation. Furthermore, COX7A2L does not affect the biogenesis, stabilization, and function of the individual oxidative phosphorylation complexes. These data show that independent regulatory mechanisms for the biogenesis and turnover of different MRC supercomplex structures co-exist.

Abstract: Summary
The in vitro derivation and propagation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is a key goal in reproductive science. We show here that when aggregated with embryonic testicular somatic cells (reconstituted testes), primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) induced from mouse embryonic stem cells differentiate into spermatogonia-like cells in vitro and are expandable as cells that resemble germline stem cells (GSCs), a primary cell line with SSC activity. Remarkably, GSC-like cells (GSCLCs), but not PGCLCs, colonize adult testes and, albeit less effectively than GSCs, contribute to spermatogenesis and fertile offspring. Whole-genome analyses reveal that GSCLCs exhibit aberrant methylation at vulnerable regulatory elements, including those critical for spermatogenesis, which may restrain their spermatogenic potential. Our study establishes a strategy for the in vitro derivation of SSC activity from PSCs, which, we propose, relies on faithful epigenomic regulation.

Abstract: Summary
A major technological goal in neuroscience is to enable the interrogation of individual cells across the live brain. By creating a curved glass replacement to the dorsal cranium and surgical methods for its installation, we developed a chronic mouse preparation providing optical access to an estimated 800,000–1,100,000 individual neurons across the dorsal surface of neocortex. Post-surgical histological studies revealed comparable glial activation as in control mice. In behaving mice expressing a Ca2+ indicator in cortical pyramidal neurons, we performed Ca2+ imaging across neocortex using an epi-fluorescence macroscope and estimated that 25,000–50,000 individual neurons were accessible per mouse across multiple focal planes. Two-photon microscopy revealed dendritic morphologies throughout neocortex, allowed time-lapse imaging of individual cells, and yielded estimates of >1 million accessible neurons per mouse by serial tiling. This approach supports a variety of optical techniques and enables studies of cells across >30 neocortical areas in behaving mice.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteria employ surveillance complexes guided by CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats) RNAs (crRNAs) to target foreign nucleic acids for destruction. Although most type I and type III CRISPR systems require four or more distinct proteins to form multi-subunit surveillance complexes, the type I-C systems use just three proteins to achieve crRNA maturation and double-stranded DNA target recognition. We show that each protein plays multiple functional and structural roles: Cas5c cleaves pre-crRNAs and recruits Cas7 to position the RNA guide for DNA binding and unwinding by Cas8c. Cryoelectron microscopy reconstructions of free and DNA-bound forms of the Cascade/I-C surveillance complex reveal conformational changes that enable R-loop formation with distinct positioning of each DNA strand. This streamlined type I-C system explains how CRISPR pathways can evolve compact structures that retain full functionality as RNA-guided DNA capture platforms.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-specific regulation of protein levels and activity is essential for the distribution of functions among multiple cell types in animals. The finding that many genes involved in these regulatory processes have a premetazoan origin raises the intriguing possibility that the mechanisms required for spatially regulated cell differentiation evolved prior to the appearance of animals. Here, we use high-throughput proteomics in Capsaspora owczarzaki, a close unicellular relative of animals, to characterize the dynamic proteome and phosphoproteome profiles of three temporally distinct cell types in this premetazoan species. We show that life-cycle transitions are linked to extensive proteome and phosphoproteome remodeling and that they affect key genes involved in animal multicellularity, such as transcription factors and tyrosine kinases. The observation of shared features between Capsaspora and metazoans indicates that elaborate and conserved phosphosignaling and proteome regulation supported temporal cell-type differentiation in the unicellular ancestor of animals.

Abstract: Summary
A better understanding of the impact of antibiotics on bacteria is required to increase the efficiency of antibiotic treatments and to slow the emergence of resistance. Using Escherichia coli, we examined how bacteria exposed to sublethal concentrations of ampicillin adjust gene expression patterns and metabolism to simultaneously deal with the antibiotic-induced damage and maintain rapid growth. We found that the treated cells increased energy production, as well as translation and macromolecular repair and protection. These responses are adaptive, because they confer increased survival not only to lethal ampicillin treatment but also to non-antibiotic lethal stresses. This robustness is modulated by nutrient availability. Because different antibiotics and other stressors induce the same set of responses, we propose that it constitutes a general core hormetic stress response. It is plausible that this response plays an important role in the robustness of bacteria exposed to antibiotic treatments and constant environmental fluctuations in natural environments.

Abstract: Summary
The origin of the stem is a major but poorly understood aspect of plant development, partly because the stem initiates in a relatively inaccessible region of the shoot apical meristem called the rib zone (RZ). We developed quantitative 3D image analysis and clonal analysis tools, which revealed that the Arabidopsis homeodomain protein REPLUMLESS (RPL) establishes distinct patterns of oriented cell division and growth in the central and peripheral regions of the RZ. A genome-wide screen for target genes connected RPL directly to many of the key shoot development pathways, including the development of organ boundaries; accordingly, mutation of the organ boundary gene LIGHT-SENSITIVE HYPOCOTYL 4 restored RZ function and stem growth in the rpl mutant. Our work opens the way to study a developmental process of importance to crop improvement and highlights how apparently simple changes in 3D organ growth can reflect more complex internal changes in oriented cell activities.

Abstract: Summary
A key challenge in understanding and ultimately treating autism is to identify common molecular mechanisms underlying this genetically heterogeneous disorder. Transcriptomic profiling of autistic brains has revealed correlated misregulation of the neuronal splicing regulator nSR100/SRRM4 and its target microexon splicing program in more than one-third of analyzed individuals. To investigate whether nSR100 misregulation is causally linked to autism, we generated mutant mice with reduced levels of this protein and its target splicing program. Remarkably, these mice display multiple autistic-like features, including altered social behaviors, synaptic density, and signaling. Moreover, increased neuronal activity, which is often associated with autism, results in a rapid decrease in nSR100 and splicing of microexons that significantly overlap those misregulated in autistic brains. Collectively, our results provide evidence that misregulation of an nSR100-dependent splicing network controlled by changes in neuronal activity is causally linked to a substantial fraction of autism cases.

Abstract: Summary
While gene regulatory networks involved in cardiogenesis have been characterized, the role of bioenergetics remains less studied. Here we show that until midgestation, myocardial metabolism is compartmentalized, with a glycolytic signature restricted to compact myocardium contrasting with increased mitochondrial oxidative activity in the trabeculae. HIF1α regulation mirrors this pattern, with expression predominating in compact myocardium and scarce in trabeculae. By midgestation, the compact myocardium downregulates HIF1α and switches toward oxidative metabolism. Deletion of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Vhl results in HIF1α hyperactivation, blocking the midgestational metabolic shift and impairing cardiac maturation and function. Moreover, the altered glycolytic signature induced by HIF1 trabecular activation precludes regulation of genes essential for establishment of the cardiac conduction system. Our findings reveal VHL-HIF-mediated metabolic compartmentalization in the developing heart and the connection between metabolism and myocardial differentiation. These results highlight the importance of bioenergetics in ventricular myocardium specialization and its potential relevance to congenital heart disease.

Abstract: Summary
Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in orchestrating adaptive immune responses. In human blood, three distinct subsets exist: plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and BDCA3+ and CD1c+ myeloid DCs. In addition, a DC-like CD16+ monocyte has been reported. Although RNA-expression profiles have been previously compared, protein expression data may provide a different picture. Here, we exploited label-free quantitative mass spectrometry to compare and identify differences in primary human DC subset proteins. Moreover, we integrated these proteomic data with existing mRNA data to derive robust cell-specific expression signatures with more than 400 differentially expressed proteins between subsets, forming a solid basis for investigation of subset-specific functions. We illustrated this by extracting subset identification markers and by demonstrating that pDCs lack caspase-1 and only express low levels of other inflammasome-related proteins. In accordance, pDCs were incapable of interleukin (IL)-1β secretion in response to ATP.

Abstract: Stable expression of Foxp3 is ensured by demethylation of CpG motifs in the Foxp3 intronic element, the conserved non-coding sequence 2 (CNS2), which persists throughout the lifespan of regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, little is known about the mechanisms on how CNS2 demethylation is sustained. In this study, we found that Ten-Eleven- Translocation (Tet) DNA dioxygenase protects the CpG motifs of CNS2 from re-methylation by DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) and prevents Tregs from losing Foxp3 expression under inflammatory conditions. Upon stimulation of Tregs by interleukin-6 (IL6), Dnmt1 was recruited to CNS2 and induced methylation, which was inhibited by Tet2 recruited by IL2. Tet2 prevented CNS2 re-methylation by not only the occupancy of the CNS2 locus but also by its enzymatic activity. These results show that the CNS2 methylation status is dynamically regulated by a balance between Tets and Dnmts which influences the expression of Foxp3 in Tregs.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation and the localization and post-translational modification of nucleosomes are interdependent factors that contribute to the generation of distinct phenotypes from genetically identical cells. With 112 whole-genome bisulfite sequencing datasets from the BLUEPRINT Epigenome Project, we analyzed the global development of DNA methylation patterns during lineage commitment and maturation of a range of immune system effector cells and the cancers that arise from them. We show clear trends in methylation patterns that are distinct in the innate and adaptive arms of the human immune system, both globally and in relation to consistently positioned nucleosomes. Most notable are a progressive loss of methylation in developing lymphocytes and the consistent occurrence of non-CG methylation in specific cell types. Cancer samples from the two lineages are further polarized, suggesting the involvement of distinct lineage-specific epigenetic mechanisms. We anticipate broad utility for this resource as a basis for further comparative epigenetic analyses.

Abstract: Clinical voice disorders pose significant communication-related challenges to patients. The purpose of this study was to quantify the rate of apoptosis and tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) signaling in vocal fold epithelial cells in response to increasing time‐doses and cycle‐doses of vibration. 20 New Zealand white breeder rabbits were randomized to three groups of time‐doses of vibration exposure (30, 60, 120min) or a control group (120min of vocal fold adduction and abduction). Estimated cycle-doses of vocal fold vibration were extrapolated based on mean fundamental frequency. Laryngeal tissue specimens were evaluated for apoptosis and gene transcript and protein levels of TNF-α. Results revealed that terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was significantly higher after 120min of vibration compared to the control. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed no significant effect of time‐dose on the mean area of epithelial cell nuclei. Extrapolated cycle‐doses of vibration exposure were closely related to experimental time‐dose conditions, although no significant correlations were observed with TUNEL staining or mean area of epithelial cell nuclei. TUNEL staining was positively correlated with TNF-α protein expression. Our findings suggest that apoptosis can be induced in the vocal fold epithelium after 120min of modal intensity phonation. In contrast, shorter durations of vibration exposure do not result in apoptosis signaling. However, morphological features of apoptosis are not observed using TEM. Future studies are necessary to examine the contribution of abnormal apoptosis to vocal fold diseases.

Abstract: In the pancreas of many mammals including humans, endocrine islet cells can be integrated with the nervous system components into neuro-insular complexes. The mechanism of the formation of such complexes is not clearly understood. The present study evaluated the interactions between the nervous system components, epithelial cells and endocrine cells in the human pancreas. Foetal pancreas, gestational age 19–23 weeks (13 cases) and 30–34 weeks (7 cases), were studied using double immunohistochemical labeling with neural markers (S100 protein and beta III tubulin), epithelial marker (cytokeratin 19 (CK19)) and antibodies to insulin and glucagon. We first analyse the structure of neuro-insular complexes using confocal microscopy and provide immunohistochemical evidences of the presence of endocrine cells within the ganglia or inside the nerve bundles. We showed that the nervous system components contact with the epithelial cells located in ducts or in clusters outside the ductal epithelium and form complexes with separate epithelial cells. We observed CK19-positive cells inside the ganglia and nerve bundles which were located separately or were integrated with the islets. Therefore, we conclude that neuro-insular complexes may forms as a result of integration between epithelial cells and nervous system components at the initial stages of islets formation.

Abstract: Summary
The human Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (hMRN) complex is critical for the sensing, processing, and signaling of DNA double-strand breaks. The nuclease activity of Mre11 is essential for mammalian development and cell viability, although the regulation and substrate specificity of Mre11 have been difficult to define. Here we show that hMRN catalyzes sequential endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic activities on both 5′ and 3′ strands of DNA ends containing protein adducts, and that Nbs1, ATP, and adducts are essential for this function. In contrast, Nbs1 inhibits Mre11/Rad50-catalyzed 3′-to-5′ exonucleolytic degradation of clean DNA ends. The hMRN endonucleolytic cleavage events are further stimulated by the phosphorylated form of the human C-terminal binding protein-interacting protein (CtIP) DNA repair enzyme, establishing a role for CtIP in regulating hMRN activity. These results illuminate the important role of Nbs1 and CtIP in determining the substrates and consequences of human Mre11/Rad50 nuclease activities on protein-DNA lesions.

Abstract: Summary
Brown-like adipocytes exist in several adipose depots including white (WAT) as well as brown (BAT). Activation of these UCP1+ cells is a potential therapeutic strategy to combat obesity. Studies have shown that posttranslational modifications of PPARγ regulate select adipocyte programs. Deacetylation of K268 and K293 in the ligand-binding domain of PPARγ by Sirt1 induces browning of WAT. Phosphorylation of S273 of PPARγ by CDK5 or ERK stimulates a diabetogenic program of gene expression in WAT. Here, we report that roscovitine, a CDK inhibitor, prevents S273 phosphorylation and promotes formation of UCP1+ (brite) adipocytes in WAT. It also enhances energy expenditure as well as prevents diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Analysis of fluorescence-activated cell-sorted UCP1+ adipocytes shows that the mRNA signature of brite adipocytes is distinct from beige adipocytes, which arise through catecholamine signaling. These results suggest that brown-like adipocytes in WAT may arise from multiple origins.

Abstract: Summary
Mediator is a transcriptional co-activator recruited to enhancers by DNA-binding activators, and it also interacts with RNA polymerase (Pol) II as part of the preinitiation complex (PIC). We demonstrate that a single Mediator complex associates with the enhancer and core promoter in vivo, indicating that it can physically bridge these transcriptional elements. However, the Mediator kinase module associates strongly with the enhancer, but not with the core promoter, and it dissociates from the enhancer upon depletion of the TFIIH kinase. Severing the kinase module from Mediator by removing the connecting subunit Med13 does not affect Mediator association at the core promoter but increases occupancy at enhancers. Thus, Mediator undergoes a compositional change in which the kinase module, recruited via Mediator to the enhancer, dissociates from Mediator to permit association with Pol II and the PIC. As such, Mediator acts as a dynamic bridge between the enhancer and core promoter.

Abstract: Summary
During the course of infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is exposed to diverse redox stresses that trigger metabolic and physiological changes. How these stressors are sensed and relayed to the Mtb transcriptional apparatus remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that WhiB6 differentially regulates the ESX-1 and DosR regulons through its Fe-S cluster. When challenged with NO, WhiB6 continually activates expression of the DosR regulons but regulates ESX-1 expression through initial activation followed by gradual inhibition. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of the holo- and reduced apo-WhiB6 complemented strains confirms these results and also reveals that WhiB6 controls aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, cell division, and virulence. Using the Mycobacterium marinum zebrafish infection model, we find that holo- and apo-WhiB6 modulate levels of mycobacterial infection, granuloma formation, and dissemination. These findings provide fresh insight into the role of WhiB6 in mycobacterial infection, dissemination, and disease development.

Abstract: The efficiency of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in plants depends on the virulence of Agrobacteriumstrains, the plant tissue culture conditions, and the susceptibility of host plants. Understanding the molecular interactions between Agrobacterium and host plant cells is crucial when manipulating the susceptibility of recalcitrant crop plants and protecting orchard trees from crown gall disease. It was discovered that Arabidopsis voltagedependent anion channel 1 (atvdac1) mutant has drastic effects on Agrobacterium-mediated tumorigenesis and growth developmental phenotypes, and that these effects are dependent on a Ws-0 genetic background. Genetic complementation of Arabidopsis vdac1 mutants and yeast porin1-deficient strain with members of the AtVDAC gene family revealed that AtVDAC1 is required for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and there is weak functional redundancy between AtVDAC1 and AtVDAC3, which is independent of porin activity. Furthermore, atvdac1 mutants were deficient in transient and stable transformation by Agrobacterium, suggesting that AtVDAC1 is involved in the early stages of Agrobacterium infection prior to transferred-DNA (T-DNA) integration. Transgenic plants overexpressing AtVDAC1 not only complemented the phenotypes of the atvdac1 mutant, but also showed high efficiency of transient T-DNA gene expression; however, the efficiency of stable transformation was not affected. Moreover, the effect of phytohormone treatment on competence to Agrobacterium was compromised in atvdac1 mutants. These data indicate that AtVDAC1 regulates the competence of Arabidopsis to Agrobacterium infection.

Abstract: Summary
Opioids remain the standard for analgesic care; however, adverse effects of systemic treatments contraindicate long-term administration. While most clinical opioids target mu opioid receptors (MOR), those that target the delta class (DOR) also demonstrate analgesic efficacy. Furthermore, peripherally restrictive opioids represent an attractive direction for analgesia. However, opioid receptors including DOR are analgesically incompetent in the absence of inflammation. Here, we report that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) naively associates with plasma membrane DOR in peripheral sensory neurons to inhibit analgesic agonist efficacy. This interaction prevents optimal Gβ subunit association with the receptor, thereby reducing DOR activity. Importantly, bradykinin stimulates GRK2 movement away from DOR and onto Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP). protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent RKIP phosphorylation induces GRK2 sequestration, restoring DOR functionality in sensory neurons. Together, these results expand the known function of GRK2, identifying a non-internalizing role to maintain peripheral DOR in an analgesically incompetent state.

Abstract: Summary
The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) Tankyrase (TNKS and TNKS2) is paramount to Wnt-β-catenin signaling and a promising therapeutic target in Wnt-dependent cancers. The pool of active β-catenin is normally limited by destruction complexes, whose assembly depends on the polymeric master scaffolding protein AXIN. Tankyrase, which poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates and thereby destabilizes AXIN, also can polymerize, but the relevance of these polymers has remained unclear. We report crystal structures of the polymerizing TNKS and TNKS2 sterile alpha motif (SAM) domains, revealing versatile head-to-tail interactions. Biochemical studies informed by these structures demonstrate that polymerization is required for Tankyrase to drive β-catenin-dependent transcription. We show that the polymeric state supports PARP activity and allows Tankyrase to effectively access destruction complexes through enabling avidity-dependent AXIN binding. This study provides an example for regulated signal transduction in non-membrane-enclosed compartments (signalosomes), and it points to novel potential strategies to inhibit Tankyrase function in oncogenic Wnt signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Polycomb group proteins and the related histone modification H3K27me3 can maintain the silencing of key developmental regulators and provide cellular memory. However, how such an epigenetic state is reprogrammed and inherited between generations is poorly understood. Using an ultra-sensitive approach, STAR ChIP-seq, we investigated H3K27me3 across 14 developmental stages along mouse gametogenesis and early development. Interestingly, highly pervasive H3K27me3 is found in regions depleted of transcription and DNA methylation in oocytes. Unexpectedly, we observed extensive loss of promoter H3K27me3 at Hox and other developmental genes upon fertilization. This is accompanied by global erasure of sperm H3K27me3 but inheritance of distal H3K27me3 from oocytes. The resulting allele-specific H3K27me3 patterns persist to blastocysts before being converted to canonical forms in postimplantation embryos, where both H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent promoter marks are restored at developmental genes. Together, these data revealed widespread resetting of epigenetic memory and striking plasticity of epigenome during gametogenesis and early development.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondria are essential for numerous cellular processes, yet hundreds of their proteins lack robust functional annotation. To reveal functions for these proteins (termed MXPs), we assessed condition-specific protein-protein interactions for 50 select MXPs using affinity enrichment mass spectrometry. Our data connect MXPs to diverse mitochondrial processes, including multiple aspects of respiratory chain function. Building upon these observations, we validated C17orf89 as a complex I (CI) assembly factor. Disruption of C17orf89 markedly reduced CI activity, and its depletion is found in an unresolved case of CI deficiency. We likewise discovered that LYRM5 interacts with and deflavinates the electron-transferring flavoprotein that shuttles electrons to coenzyme Q (CoQ). Finally, we identified a dynamic human CoQ biosynthetic complex involving multiple MXPs whose topology we map using purified components. Collectively, our data lend mechanistic insight into respiratory chain-related activities and prioritize hundreds of additional interactions for further exploration of mitochondrial protein function.

Abstract: Summary
The accumulation of damage caused by oxidative stress has been linked to aging and to the etiology of numerous age-related diseases. The longevity gene, sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), promotes genome stability by facilitating DNA repair, especially under oxidative stress conditions. Here we uncover the mechanism by which SIRT6 is activated by oxidative stress to promote DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. We show that the stress-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylates SIRT6 on serine 10 in response to oxidative stress. This post-translational modification facilitates the mobilization of SIRT6 to DNA damage sites and is required for efficient recruitment of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) to DNA break sites and for efficient repair of DSBs. Our results demonstrate a post-translational mechanism regulating SIRT6, and they provide the link between oxidative stress signaling and DNA repair pathways that may be critical for hormetic response and longevity assurance.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are self-renewing multipotent stem cells that generate mature blood lineages throughout life. They, together with hematopoietic progenitor cells (collectively known as HSPCs), emerge from hemogenic endothelium in the floor of the embryonic dorsal aorta by an endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). Here we demonstrate that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is required for HSPC specification and that it regulates the expression of the Notch ligand Jagged1a in endothelial cells prior to EHT, in a striking parallel with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The requirement for TGFβ is two fold and sequential: autocrine via Tgfβ1a and Tgfβ1b produced in the endothelial cells themselves, followed by a paracrine input of Tgfβ3 from the notochord, suggesting that the former programs the hemogenic endothelium and the latter drives EHT. Our findings have important implications for the generation of HSPCs from pluripotent cells in vitro.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory adaptation is a phenomenon in which neurons are affected not only by their immediate input but also by the sequence of preceding inputs. In visual cortex, for example, neurons shift their preferred orientation after exposure to an oriented stimulus. This adaptation is traditionally attributed to plasticity. We show that a recurrent network generates tuning curve shifts observed in cat and macaque visual cortex, even when all synaptic weights and intrinsic properties in the model are fixed. This demonstrates that, in a recurrent network, adaptation on timescales of hundreds of milliseconds does not require plasticity. Given the ubiquity of recurrent connections, this phenomenon likely contributes to responses observed across cortex and shows that plasticity cannot be inferred solely from changes in tuning on these timescales. More broadly, our findings show that recurrent connections can endow a network with a powerful mechanism to store and integrate recent contextual information.

Abstract: Summary
Viral persistence specifically inhibits CD4 Th1 responses and promotes Tfh immunity, but the mechanisms that suppress Th1 cells and the disease consequences of their loss are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of CD4 Th1 cells specifically leads to progressive CD8 T cell decline and dysfunction during viral persistence. Therapeutically reconstituting CD4 Th1 cells restored CD4 T cell polyfunctionality, enhanced antiviral CD8 T cell numbers and function, and enabled viral control. Mechanistically, combined interaction of PD-L1 and IL-10 by suppressive dendritic cell subsets inhibited new CD4 Th1 cells in both acute and persistent virus infection, demonstrating an unrecognized suppressive function for PD-L1 in virus infection. Thus, the loss of CD4 Th1 cells is a key event leading to progressive CD8 T cell demise during viral persistence with important implications for restoring antiviral CD8 T cell immunity to control persistent viral infection.

Abstract: Summary
Recent reports suggest that botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) A, which is widely used clinically to inhibit neurotransmission, can spread within networks of neurons to have distal effects, but this remains controversial. Moreover, it is not known whether other members of this toxin family are transferred between neurons. Here, we investigate the potential distal effects of BoNT/A, BoNT/D, and tetanus toxin (TeNT), using central neurons grown in microfluidic devices. Toxins acted upon the neurons that mediated initial entry, but all three toxins were also taken up, via an alternative pathway, into non-acidified organelles that mediated retrograde transport to the somato-dendritic compartment. Toxins were then released into the media, where they entered and exerted their effects upon upstream neurons. These findings directly demonstrate that these agents undergo transcytosis and interneuronal transfer in an active form, resulting in long-distance effects.

Abstract: Summary
Rapidly proliferating leukemic progenitor cells consume substantial glucose, which may lead to glucose insufficiency in bone marrow. We show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are prone to fructose utilization with an upregulated fructose transporter GLUT5, which compensates for glucose deficiency. Notably, AML patients with upregulated transcription of the GLUT5-encoding gene SLC2A5 or increased fructose utilization have poor outcomes. Pharmacological blockage of fructose uptake ameliorates leukemic phenotypes and potentiates the cytotoxicity of the antileukemic agent, Ara-C. In conclusion, this study highlights enhanced fructose utilization as a metabolic feature of AML and a potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin is thought to carry epigenetic information from one generation to the next, although it is unclear how such information survives the disruptions of nucleosomal architecture occurring during genomic replication. Here, we measure a key aspect of chromatin structure dynamics during replication—how rapidly nucleosome positions are established on the newly replicated daughter genomes. By isolating newly synthesized DNA marked with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU), we characterize nucleosome positions on both daughter genomes of S. cerevisiae during chromatin maturation. We find that nucleosomes rapidly adopt their mid-log positions at highly transcribed genes, which is consistent with a role for transcription in positioning nucleosomes in vivo. Additionally, experiments in hir1Δ mutants reveal a role for HIR in nucleosome spacing. We also characterized nucleosome positions on the leading and lagging strands, uncovering differences in chromatin maturation dynamics at hundreds of genes. Our data define the maturation dynamics of newly replicated chromatin and support a role for transcription in sculpting the chromatin template.

Abstract: Summary
The t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated oncoprotein AML1-ETO disrupts normal hematopoietic differentiation. Here, we have investigated its effects on the transcriptome and epigenome in t(8,21) patient cells. AML1-ETO binding was found at promoter regions of active genes with high levels of histone acetylation but also at distal elements characterized by low acetylation levels and binding of the hematopoietic transcription factors LYL1 and LMO2. In contrast, ERG, FLI1, TAL1, and RUNX1 bind at all AML1-ETO-occupied regulatory regions, including those of the AML1-ETO gene itself, suggesting their involvement in regulating AML1-ETO expression levels. While expression of AML1-ETO in myeloid differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) induces leukemic characteristics, overexpression increases cell death. We find that expression of wild-type transcription factors RUNX1 and ERG in AML is required to prevent this oncogene overexpression. Together our results show that the interplay of the epigenome and transcription factors prevents apoptosis in t(8;21) AML cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer progression depends on both cell-intrinsic processes and interactions between different cell types. However, large-scale assessment of cell type composition and molecular profiles of individual cell types within tumors remains challenging. To address this, we developed epigenomic deconvolution (EDec), an in silico method that infers cell type composition of complex tissues as well as DNA methylation and gene transcription profiles of constituent cell types. By applying EDec to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast tumors, we detect changes in immune cell infiltration related to patient prognosis, and a striking change in stromal fibroblast-to-adipocyte ratio across breast cancer subtypes. Furthermore, we show that a less adipose stroma tends to display lower levels of mitochondrial activity and to be associated with cancerous cells with higher levels of oxidative metabolism. These findings highlight the role of stromal composition in the metabolic coupling between distinct cell types within tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are innate T lymphocytes that promote host defense against a variety of microbial pathogens. Whether microbial ligands are required for their protective effects remains unclear. Here, we show that iNKT cells stimulate human-monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) to produce inflammatory mediators in a manner that does not require the presence of microbial compounds. Interleukin 2 (IL-2)-exposed iNKT cells selectively induced repeated cytoplasmic Ca2+ fluxes in DCs that were dependent on signaling by the P2X7 purinergic receptor and mediated by ATP released during iNKT-DC interactions. Exposure to iNKT cells led to DC cyclooxygenase 2 (PTGS2) gene transcription, and release of PGE2 that was associated with vascular permeabilization in vivo. Additionally, soluble factors were released that induced neutrophil recruitment and activation and enhanced control of Candida albicans. These results suggest that sterile interactions between iNKT cells and monocyte-derived DCs lead to the production of non-redundant inflammatory mediators that promote neutrophil responses.

Abstract: Summary
The synthesis of ribosomes is regulated by both amino acid abundance and the availability of ATP, which regenerates guanosine triphosphate (GTP), powers ribosomes, and promotes transcription of rRNA genes. We now report that bacteria supersede both of these controls when experiencing low cytosolic magnesium (Mg2+), a divalent cation essential for ribosome stabilization and for neutralization of ATP’s negative charge. We uncover a regulatory circuit that responds to low cytosolic Mg2+ by promoting expression of proteins that import Mg2+ and lower ATP amounts. This response reduces the levels of ATP and ribosomes, making Mg2+ ions available for translation. Mutants defective in Mg2+ uptake and unable to reduce ATP levels accumulate non-functional ribosomal components and undergo translational arrest. Our findings establish a paradigm whereby cells reduce the amounts of translating ribosomes to carry out protein synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Human genetic studies have recently suggested that the postsynaptic activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) complex is a convergence signal for several genes implicated in schizophrenia. However, the functional significance of Arc in schizophrenia-related neurobehavioral phenotypes and brain circuits is unclear. Here, we find that, consistent with schizophrenia-related phenotypes, disruption of Arc in mice produces deficits in sensorimotor gating, cognitive functions, social behaviors, and amphetamine-induced psychomotor responses. Furthermore, genetic disruption of Arc leads to concomitant hypoactive mesocortical and hyperactive mesostriatal dopamine pathways. Application of a D1 agonist to the prefrontal cortex or a D2 antagonist in the ventral striatum rescues Arc-dependent cognitive or psychomotor abnormalities, respectively. Our findings demonstrate a role for Arc in the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission and related behaviors. The results also provide initial biological support implicating Arc in dopaminergic and behavioral abnormalities related to schizophrenia.

Abstract: Summary
The realization that nuclear distribution of DNA, RNA, and proteins differs between cell types and developmental stages suggests that nuclear organization serves regulatory functions. Understanding the logic of nuclear architecture and how it contributes to differentiation and cell fate commitment remains challenging. Here, we use soft X-ray tomography (SXT) to image chromatin organization, distribution, and biophysical properties during neurogenesis in vivo. Our analyses reveal that chromatin with similar biophysical properties forms an elaborate connected network throughout the entire nucleus. Although this interconnectivity is present in every developmental stage, differentiation proceeds with concomitant increase in chromatin compaction and re-distribution of condensed chromatin toward the nuclear core. HP1β, but not nucleosome spacing or phasing, regulates chromatin rearrangements because it governs both the compaction of chromatin and its interactions with the nuclear envelope. Our experiments introduce SXT as a powerful imaging technology for nuclear architecture.

Structural and Biochemical Studies Reveal a Putative FtsZ Recognition Site on the Z-ring Stabilizer ZapD,

Abstract: FtsZ, a tubulin homologue, is an essential protein of the Z- ring assembly in bacterial cell division. It consists of two domains, the N-terminal and C-terminal core domains, and has a conserved C-terminal tail region. Lateral interactions between FtsZ protofilaments and several Z-ring associated proteins (Zaps) are necessary for modulating Z-ring formation. ZapD, one of the positive regulators of Z-ring assembly, directly binds to the C-terminal tail of FtsZ and promotes stable Z-ring formation during cytokinesis. To gain structural and functional insights into how ZapD interacts with the C-terminal tail of FtsZ, we solved two crystal structures of ZapD proteins from Salmonella typhimuri- um (StZapD) and Escherichia coli (EcZapD) at a 2.6 and 3.1 A resolution, respectively. Several conserved residues are clustered on the concave sides of the StZapD and EcZapD dimers, the suggested FtsZ binding site. Modeled structures of EcZapD-EcFtsZ and subsequent binding studies using bio-layer interferometry also identified the EcFtsZ binding site on EcZapD. The structural insights and the results of bio-layer interferometry assays suggest that the two FtsZ binding sites of ZapD dimer might be responsible for the binding of ZapD dimer to two protofilaments to hold them together.

Abstract: Summary
Disordered transcriptomes of cancer encompass direct effects of somatic mutation on transcription, coordinated secondary pathway alterations, and increased transcriptional noise. To catalog the rules governing how somatic mutation exerts direct transcriptional effects, we developed an exhaustive pipeline for analyzing RNA sequencing data, which we integrated with whole genomes from 23 breast cancers. Using X-inactivation analyses, we found that cancer cells are more transcriptionally active than intermixed stromal cells. This is especially true in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors. Overall, 59% of substitutions were expressed. Nonsense mutations showed lower expression levels than expected, with patterns characteristic of nonsense-mediated decay. 14% of 4,234 rearrangements caused transcriptional abnormalities, including exon skips, exon reusage, fusions, and premature polyadenylation. We found productive, stable transcription from sense-to-antisense gene fusions and gene-to-intergenic rearrangements, suggesting that these mutation classes drive more transcriptional disruption than previously suspected. Systematic integration of transcriptome with genome data reveals the rules by which transcriptional machinery interprets somatic mutation.

Abstract: Summary
Small-molecule inhibitors targeting growth factor receptors have failed to show efficacy for brain cancers, potentially due to their inability to achieve sufficient drug levels in the CNS. Targeting non-oncogene tumor co-dependencies provides an alternative approach, particularly if drugs with high brain penetration can be identified. Here we demonstrate that the highly lethal brain cancer glioblastoma (GBM) is remarkably dependent on cholesterol for survival, rendering these tumors sensitive to Liver X receptor (LXR) agonist-dependent cell death. We show that LXR-623, a clinically viable, highly brain-penetrant LXRα-partial/LXRβ-full agonist selectively kills GBM cells in an LXRβ- and cholesterol-dependent fashion, causing tumor regression and prolonged survival in mouse models. Thus, a metabolic co-dependency provides a pharmacological means to kill growth factor-activated cancers in the CNS.

Abstract: Summary
ATM phosphorylation of Mdm2-S394 is required for robust p53 stabilization and activation in DNA-damaged cells. We have now utilized Mdm2S394A knockin mice to determine that phosphorylation of Mdm2-S394 regulates p53 activity and the DNA damage response in lymphatic tissues in vivo by modulating Mdm2 stability. Mdm2-S394 phosphorylation delays lymphomagenesis in Eμ-myc transgenic mice, and preventing Mdm2-S394 phosphorylation obviates the need for p53 mutation in Myc-driven tumorigenesis. However, irradiated Mdm2S394A mice also have increased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell functions, and we observed decreased lymphomagenesis in sub-lethally irradiated Mdm2S394A mice. These findings document contrasting effects of ATM-Mdm2 signaling on p53 tumor suppression and reveal that destabilizing Mdm2 by promoting its phosphorylation by ATM would be effective in treating oncogene-induced malignancies, while inhibiting Mdm2-S394 phosphorylation during radiation exposure or chemotherapy would ameliorate bone marrow failure and prevent the development of secondary hematological malignancies.

Abstract: Summary
For many years, a connection between circadian clocks and cancer has been postulated. Here we describe an unexpected function for the circadian repressor CRY2 as a component of an FBXL3-containing E3 ligase that recruits T58-phosphorylated c-MYC for ubiquitylation. c-MYC is a critical regulator of cell proliferation; T58 is central in a phosphodegron long recognized as a hotspot for mutation in cancer. This site is also targeted by FBXW7, although the full machinery responsible for its turnover has remained obscure. CRY1 cannot substitute for CRY2 in promoting c-MYC degradation. Their unique functions may explain prior conflicting reports that have fueled uncertainty about the relationship between clocks and cancer. We demonstrate that c-MYC is a target of CRY2-dependent protein turnover, suggesting a molecular mechanism for circadian control of cell growth and a new paradigm for circadian protein degradation.

Robust Replication Control Is Generated by Temporal Gaps between Licensing and Firing Phases and Depends on Degradation of Firing Factor Sld2,

Abstract: Summary
Temporal separation of DNA replication initiation into licensing and firing phases ensures the precise duplication of the genome during each cell cycle. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is known to generate this separation by activating firing factors and at the same time inhibiting licensing factors but may not be sufficient to ensure robust separation at transitions between both phases. Here, we show that a temporal gap separates the inactivation of firing factors from the re-activation of licensing factors during mitosis in budding yeast. We find that gap size critically depends on phosphorylation-dependent degradation of the firing factor Sld2 mediated by CDK, DDK, Mck1, and Cdc5 kinases and the ubiquitin-ligases Dma1/2. Stable mutants of Sld2 minimize the gap and cause increased genome instability in an origin-dependent manner when combined with deregulation of other replication regulators or checkpoint mechanisms. Robust separation of licensing and firing phases therefore appears indispensable to safeguard genome stability.

Abstract: Summary
High-protein (HP) intake during weight loss (WL) therapy is often recommended because it reduces the loss of lean tissue mass. However, HP intake could have adverse effects on metabolic function, because protein ingestion reduces postprandial insulin sensitivity. In this study, we compared the effects of ∼10% WL with a hypocaloric diet containing 0.8 g protein/kg/day and a hypocaloric diet containing 1.2 g protein/kg/day on muscle insulin action in postmenopausal women with obesity. We found that HP intake reduced the WL-induced decline in lean tissue mass by ∼45%. However, HP intake also prevented the WL-induced improvements in muscle insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, as well as the WL-induced adaptations in oxidative stress and cell structural biology pathways. Our data demonstrate that the protein content of a WL diet can have profound effects on metabolic function and underscore the importance of considering dietary macronutrient composition during WL therapy for people with obesity.

Abstract: Summary
Connective tissues—skeleton, dermis, pericytes, fascia—are a key cell source for regenerating the patterned skeleton during axolotl appendage regeneration. This complexity has made it difficult to identify the cells that regenerate skeletal tissue. Inability to identify these cells has impeded a mechanistic understanding of blastema formation. By tracing cells during digit tip regeneration using brainbow transgenic axolotls, we show that cells from each connective tissue compartment have distinct spatial and temporal profiles of proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Chondrocytes proliferate but do not migrate into the regenerate. In contrast, pericytes proliferate, then migrate into the blastema and give rise solely to pericytes. Periskeletal cells and fibroblasts contribute the bulk of digit blastema cells and acquire diverse fates according to successive waves of migration that choreograph their proximal-distal and tissue contributions. We further show that platelet-derived growth factor signaling is a potent inducer of fibroblast migration, which is required to form the blastema.

Abstract: Summary
To better understand why human neonates show a poor response to intracellular pathogens, we compared gene expression and histone modification profiles of neonatal naive CD8+ T cells with that of their adult counterparts. We found that neonatal lymphocytes have a distinct epigenomic landscape associated with a lower expression of genes involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and cytotoxicity and a higher expression of genes involved in the cell cycle and innate immunity. Functional studies corroborated that neonatal CD8+ T cells are less cytotoxic, transcribe antimicrobial peptides, and produce reactive oxygen species. Altogether, our results show that neonatal CD8+ T cells have a specific genetic program biased toward the innate immune response. These findings will contribute to better diagnosis and management of the neonatal immune response.

Abstract: Summary
During embryonic development, cells must establish fates, morphologies, and behaviors in coordination with one another to form a functional body. A prevalent hypothesis for how this coordination is achieved is that each cell's fate and behavior is determined by a defined mixture of RNAs. Only recently has it become possible to measure the full suite of transcripts in a single cell. Here we quantify genome-wide mRNA abundance in each cell of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo up to the 16-cell stage. We describe spatially dynamic expression, quantify cell-specific differential activation of the zygotic genome, and identify genes that were previously unappreciated as being critical for development. We present an interactive data visualization tool that allows broad access to our dataset. This genome-wide single-cell map of mRNA abundance, alongside the well-studied life history and fate of each cell, describes at a cellular resolution the mRNA landscape that guides development.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitylation regulates signaling pathways critical for cancer development and, in many cases, targets proteins for degradation. Here, we report that ubiquitylation by RNF4 stabilizes otherwise short-lived oncogenic transcription factors, including β-catenin, Myc, c-Jun, and the Notch intracellular-domain (N-ICD) protein. RNF4 enhances the transcriptional activity of these factors, as well as Wnt- and Notch-dependent gene expression. While RNF4 is a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase, protein stabilization requires the substrate’s phosphorylation, rather than SUMOylation, and binding to RNF4’s arginine-rich motif domain. Stabilization also involves generation of unusual polyubiquitin chains and docking of RNF4 to chromatin. Biologically, RNF4 enhances the tumor phenotype and is essential for cancer cell survival. High levels of RNF4 mRNA correlate with poor survival of a subgroup of breast cancer patients, and RNF4 protein levels are elevated in 30% of human colon adenocarcinomas. Thus, RNF4-dependent ubiquitylation translates transient phosphorylation signal(s) into long-term protein stabilization, resulting in enhanced oncoprotein activation.

Nfix Induces a Switch in Sox6 Transcriptional Activity to Regulate MyHC-I Expression in Fetal Muscle,

Abstract: Summary
Sox6 belongs to the Sox gene family and plays a pivotal role in fiber type differentiation, suppressing transcription of slow-fiber-specific genes during fetal development. Here, we show that Sox6 plays opposite roles in MyHC-I regulation, acting as a positive and negative regulator of MyHC-I expression during embryonic and fetal myogenesis, respectively. During embryonic myogenesis, Sox6 positively regulates MyHC-I via transcriptional activation of Mef2C, whereas during fetal myogenesis, Sox6 requires and cooperates with the transcription factor Nfix in repressing MyHC-I expression. Mechanistically, Nfix is necessary for Sox6 binding to the MyHC-I promoter and thus for Sox6 repressive function, revealing a key role for Nfix in driving Sox6 activity. This feature is evolutionarily conserved, since the orthologs Nfixa and Sox6 contribute to repression of the slow-twitch phenotype in zebrafish embryos. These data demonstrate functional cooperation between Sox6 and Nfix in regulating MyHC-I expression during prenatal muscle development.

Abstract: Summary
Survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells strictly depends on the support of an appropriate tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that LYN kinase is essential for CLL progression. Lyn deficiency results in a significantly reduced CLL burden in vivo. Loss of Lyn within leukemic cells reduces B cell receptor (BCR) signaling including BTK phosphorylation, but surprisingly does not affect leukemic cell expansion. Instead, syngeneic CLL transplantation of CLL cells into Lyn- or Btk-deficient recipients results in a strongly delayed leukemic progression and prolonged survival. Moreover, Lyn deficiency in macrophages hinders nursing functions for CLL cells, which is mediated by direct contact rather than secretion of soluble factors. Taken together, LYN and BTK seem essential for the formation of a microenvironment supporting leukemic growth.

Abstract: Summary
While DNA replication and mitosis occur in a sequential manner, precisely how cells maintain their temporal separation and order remains elusive. Here, we unveil a double-negative feedback loop between replication intermediates and an M-phase-specific structure-selective endonuclease, MUS81-SLX4, which renders DNA replication and mitosis mutually exclusive. MUS81 nuclease is constitutively active throughout the cell cycle but requires association with SLX4 for efficient substrate targeting. To preclude toxic processing of replicating chromosomes, WEE1 kinase restrains CDK1 and PLK1-mediated MUS81-SLX4 assembly during S phase. Accordingly, WEE1 inhibition triggers widespread nucleolytic breakage of replication intermediates, halting DNA replication and leading to chromosome pulverization. Unexpectedly, premature entry into mitosis—licensed by unrestrained CDK1 activity during S phase—requires MUS81-SLX4, which inhibits DNA replication. This suggests that ongoing replication assists WEE1 in delaying entry into M phase and, indirectly, in preventing MUS81-SLX4 assembly. Conversely, MUS81-SLX4 activation during mitosis promotes targeted resolution of persistent replication intermediates, which safeguards chromosome segregation.

Abstract: Summary
Microvascular endothelial cells maintain a tight barrier to prevent passage of plasma and circulating immune cells into the extravascular tissue compartment, yet endothelial cells respond rapidly to vasoactive substances, including thrombin, allowing transient paracellular permeability. This response is a cornerstone of acute inflammation, but the mechanisms responsible are still incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that thrombin triggers MALT1 to proteolytically cleave cylindromatosis (CYLD). Fragmentation of CYLD results in microtubule disruption and a cascade of events leading to endothelial cell retraction and an acute permeability response. This finding reveals an unexpected role for the MALT1 protease, which previously has been viewed mostly as a driver of pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling in lymphocytes. Thus, MALT1 not only promotes immune cell activation but also acutely regulates endothelial cell biology, actions that together facilitate tissue inflammation. Pharmacologic inhibition of MALT1 may therefore have synergistic impact by targeting multiple disparate steps in the overall inflammatory response.

An Interaction with Ewing’s Sarcoma Breakpoint Protein EWS Defines a Specific Oncogenic Mechanism of ETS Factors Rearranged in Prostate Cancer,

Abstract: Summary
More than 50% of prostate tumors have a chromosomal rearrangement resulting in aberrant expression of an oncogenic ETS family transcription factor. However, mechanisms that differentiate the function of oncogenic ETS factors expressed in prostate tumors from non-oncogenic ETS factors expressed in normal prostate are unknown. Here, we find that four oncogenic ETS (ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5), and no other ETS, interact with the Ewing’s sarcoma breakpoint protein, EWS. This EWS interaction was necessary and sufficient for oncogenic ETS functions including gene activation, cell migration, clonogenic survival, and transformation. Significantly, the EWS interacting region of ERG has no homology with that of ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5. Therefore, this finding may explain how divergent ETS factors have a common oncogenic function. Strikingly, EWS is fused to various ETS factors by the chromosome translocations that cause Ewing’s sarcoma. Therefore, these findings link oncogenic ETS function in both prostate cancer and Ewing’s sarcoma.

TRIM11 Suppresses AIM2 Inflammasome by Degrading AIM2 via p62-Dependent Selective Autophagy,

Abstract: Summary
The AIM2 inflammasome is a key cytosolic signaling complex that is activated by double-stranded DNA, leading to the maturation of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. Dysregulated AIM2 inflammasome activity is associated with human inflammatory diseases and cancers, suggesting that its activity must be tightly regulated. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that control AIM2 levels and activity are still poorly understood. Here, we report tripartite motif 11 (TRIM11) as a key negative regulator of the AIM2 inflammasome. Upon DNA virus infection, TRIM11 binds to AIM2 via its PS domain and undergoes auto-polyubiquitination at K458 to promote an association between TRIM11 and the autophagic cargo receptor p62 to mediate AIM2 degradation via selective autophagy. These findings identify a role for TRIMs in AIM2 inflammasome activation where TRIM11 acts as a secondary receptor to deliver AIM2 to the autophagosomes for degradation in a p62-dependent manner.
