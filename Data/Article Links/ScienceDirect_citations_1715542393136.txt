Abstract: Production of 3-dimensional neural progenitor cultures from human pluripotent stem cells offers the potential to generate large numbers of cells. We utilised our nanobridge system to generate 3D hPSC aggregates for differentiation towards the neural lineage, and investigate the ability to passage aggregates while maintaining cells at a stem/progenitor stage. Over 38 days, aggregate cultures exhibited upregulation and maintenance of neural-associated markers and demonstrated up to 10 fold increase in cell number. Aggregates undergoing neural induction in the presence or absence of nanobridges demonstrated no differences in marker expression, proliferation or viability. However, aggregates formed without nanobridges were statistically significantly fewer and smaller by passage 3. Organoids, cultured from aggregates, and treated with retinoic acid or rock inhibitor demonstrated terminal differentiation as assessed by immunohistochemistry. These data demonstrate that nanobridge 3D hPSC can differentiate to neural stem/progenitor cells, and be maintained at this stage through serial passaging and expansion.

Abstract: Stressors of different kinds adversely affect life history parameters like growth, development, and reproduction. Organisms overcome the negative impact of environmental stressors and strive to reach a tolerant state through genetic and metabolic activities. Ayurvedic formulations are reported to have life trait benefitting properties which improve capacity to withstand stress and tolerate adverse conditions. Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia) and Madhuyashti (Glycirrhiza glabra) Ayurvedic formulations are known to have immunomodulatory, intellect promoting, and adaptogenic properties, thus favoring good health and healthy aging. Present study investigates the efficacy of Guduchi and Madhuyashti in providing tolerance to different stresses and the underlying mechanisms using the Drosophila model. Drosophila larvae/flies fed on Guduchi or Madhuyashti were better thermo-protected, which correlated with increased expression of heat shock genes even without the heat shock. Guduchi or Madhuyashti feeding also increased antimicrobial peptide expression, thus providing better tolerance to pathogenic assaults. Feeding on Guduchi- or Madhuyashti- supplemented food also enhanced starvation and desiccation tolerance. However, neither of these formulations provided beneficial effects when grown under crowded conditions or when exposed to oxidative stressors.

Abstract: Summary
The neural crest is a transient embryonic tissue that gives rise to a multitude of derivatives in an axially restricted manner. An in vitro counterpart to neural crest can be derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and can be used to study neural crest ontogeny and neurocristopathies, and to generate cells for therapeutic purposes. In order to successfully do this, it is critical to define the specific conditions required to generate neural crest of different axial identities, as regional restriction in differentiation potential is partly cell intrinsic. WNT and FGF signaling have been implicated as inducers of posterior fate, but the exact role that these signals play in trunk neural crest formation remains unclear. Here, we present a fully defined, xeno-free system for generating trunk neural crest from hPSCs and show that FGF signaling directs cells toward different axial identities within the trunk compartment while WNT signaling is the primary determinant of trunk versus cranial identity.

Abstract: Summary
Given the immense antigenic load present in the microbiome, we hypothesized that microbiota mimotopes can be a persistent trigger in human autoimmunity via cross-reactivity. Using antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) as a model, we demonstrate cross-reactivity between non-orthologous mimotopes expressed by a common human gut commensal, Roseburia intestinalis (R. int), and T and B cell autoepitopes in the APS autoantigen β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI). Autoantigen-reactive CD4+ memory T cell clones and an APS-derived, pathogenic monoclonal antibody cross-reacted with R. int mimotopes. Core-sequence-dependent anti-R. int mimotope IgG titers were significantly elevated in APS patients and correlated with anti-β2GPI IgG autoantibodies. R. int immunization of mice induced β2GPI-specific lymphocytes and autoantibodies. Oral gavage of susceptible mice with R. int induced anti-human β2GPI autoantibodies and autoimmune pathologies. Together, these data support a role for non-orthologous commensal-host cross-reactivity in the development and persistence of autoimmunity in APS, which may apply more broadly to human autoimmune disease.

Abstract: Summary
The lack of functional understanding of most mutations in cancer, combined with the non-druggability of most proteins, challenge genomics-based identification of oncology drug targets. We implemented a machine-learning-based approach (idTRAX), which relates cell-based screening of small-molecule compounds to their kinase inhibition data, to directly identify effective and readily druggable targets. We applied idTRAX to triple-negative breast cancer cell lines and efficiently identified cancer-selective targets. For example, we found that inhibiting AKT selectively kills MFM-223 and CAL148 cells, while inhibiting FGFR2 only kills MFM-223. Since the effects of catalytically inhibiting a protein can diverge from those of reducing its levels, targets identified by idTRAX frequently differ from those identified through gene knockout/knockdown methods. This is critical if the purpose is to identify targets specifically for small-molecule drug development, whereby idTRAX may produce fewer false-positives. The rapid nature of the approach suggests that it may be applicable in personalizing therapy.

Abstract: NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) is one of the key components of the inflammasome. NLRP3 also participates in the regulation of fibrosis independent of the inflammasome. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of upregulation of NLRP3 expression in A549 cells co-cultured with THP-1 macrophages under hypoxia. Upregulation of NLRP3 was suppressed after treatment with inhibitors of TGF-β receptor or p38, but not with inhibitors of the IL-1 receptor and SMAD3. The analysis of downstream molecules of TGF-β signaling in A549 cells co-cultured with THP-1 macrophages under hypoxia showed that TGFBR1 was upregulated and SMAD7 was downregulated. Taken together, these results suggest that the upregulation of NLRP3 in A549 cells is associated with deregulated TGF-β signaling and that the interaction between NLRP3 and TGF-β signaling plays a fundamental role in fibrogenesis.

Abstract: Heterotypic CICs (cell-in-cell structures) have been found between tumor cells and various immune cells in a variety of cancer tissues. The frequency of CICs has been found to correlate with tumor malignancy in some studies but not in others. Herein, we examined in depth the CICs observed in colon cancer to determine their potential significance in disease progression. Heterotypic CICs were observed by histochemistry between epithelial cells and lymphocytes in an expanded spectrum of colon tissue from colitis to cancer and in vitro studies were performed using the colonic tumor cell line HCT8 and human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Our data revealed that the CICs formed by colonic epithelial cells and infiltrated lymphocytes not only positively correlated with tumor malignancy but also were upregulated by the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. In addition, we observed that colon cancer cells could initiate autophagy for survival after cytotoxic lymphocyte internalization and that IL-6 could also be involved in this process to promote the death of lymphocytes in CIC structures. Furthermore, certain changes were observed in tumor cells after experiencing CICs. Our findings suggest that CICs formed by colon cancer cells and lymphocytes contribute to tumor escape from immune surveillance, which could be facilitated by IL-6, and might represent a previously undescribed pathway for tumor cells to adapt and evade host immune defense.

Abstract: Summary
The human gut microbiome is comprised of densely colonizing microorganisms including bacteriophages, which are in dynamic interaction with each other and the mammalian host. To address how bacteriophages impact bacterial communities in the gut, we investigated the dynamic effects of phages on a model microbiome. Gnotobiotic mice were colonized with defined human gut commensal bacteria and subjected to predation by cognate lytic phages. We found that phage predation not only directly impacts susceptible bacteria but also leads to cascading effects on other bacterial species via interbacterial interactions. Metabolomic profiling revealed that shifts in the microbiome caused by phage predation have a direct consequence on the gut metabolome. Our work provides insight into the ecological importance of phages as modulators of bacterial colonization, and it additionally suggests the potential impact of gut phages on the mammalian host with implications for their therapeutic use to precisely modulate the microbiome.

Abstract: Summary
Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of diarrheal disease and an important contributor to early childhood mortality, malnutrition, and growth faltering. Older children in high endemicity regions appear resistant to infection, while previously unexposed adults remain susceptible. Experimental studies in humans and animals support the development of disease resistance, but we do not understand the mechanisms that underlie protective immunity to Cryptosporidium. Here, we derive an in vivo model of Cryptosporidium infection in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by isolating parasites from naturally infected wild mice. Similar to human cryptosporidiosis, this infection causes intestinal pathology, and interferon-γ controls early infection while T cells are critical for clearance. Importantly, mice that controlled a live infection were resistant to secondary challenge and vaccination with attenuated parasites provided protection equal to live infection. Both parasite and host are genetically tractable and this in vivo model will facilitate mechanistic investigation and rational vaccine design.

Abstract: Summary
The attachment of myristate to the N-terminal glycine of certain proteins is largely a co-translational modification catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), and involved in protein membrane-localization. Pathogen NMT is a validated therapeutic target in numerous infectious diseases including malaria. In Plasmodium falciparum, NMT substrates are important in essential processes including parasite gliding motility and host cell invasion. Here, we generated parasites resistant to a particular NMT inhibitor series and show that resistance in an in vitro parasite growth assay is mediated by a single amino acid substitution in the NMT substrate-binding pocket. The basis of resistance was validated and analyzed with a structure-guided approach using crystallography, in combination with enzyme activity, stability, and surface plasmon resonance assays, allowing identification of another inhibitor series unaffected by this substitution. We suggest that resistance studies incorporated early in the drug development process help selection of drug combinations to impede rapid evolution of parasite resistance.

Abstract: Summary
Owing to the intrinsic polypharmacological nature of most small-molecule kinase inhibitors, there is a need for computational models that enable systematic exploration of the chemogenomic landscape underlying druggable kinome toward more efficient kinome-profiling strategies. We implemented VirtualKinomeProfiler, an efficient computational platform that captures distinct representations of chemical similarity space of the druggable kinome for various drug discovery endeavors. By using the computational platform, we profiled approximately 37 million compound-kinase pairs and made predictions for 151,708 compounds in terms of their repositioning and lead molecule potential, against 248 kinases simultaneously. Experimental testing with biochemical assays validated 51 of the predicted interactions, identifying 19 small-molecule inhibitors of EGFR, HCK, FLT1, and MSK1 protein kinases. The prediction model led to a 1.5-fold increase in precision and 2.8-fold decrease in false-discovery rate, when compared with traditional single-dose biochemical screening, which demonstrates its potential to drastically expedite the kinome-specific drug discovery process.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro surrogate models of human cardiac tissue hold great promise in disease modeling, cardiotoxicity testing, and future applications in regenerative medicine. However, the generation of engineered human cardiac constructs with tissue-like functionality is currently thwarted by difficulties in achieving efficient maturation at the cellular and/or tissular level. Here, we report on the design and implementation of a platform for the production of engineered cardiac macrotissues from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), which we term “CardioSlice.” PSC-derived cardiomyocytes, together with human fibroblasts, are seeded into large 3D porous scaffolds and cultured using a parallelized perfusion bioreactor with custom-made culture chambers. Continuous electrical stimulation for 2 weeks promotes cardiomyocyte alignment and synchronization, and the emergence of cardiac tissue-like properties. These include electrocardiogram-like signals that can be readily measured on the surface of CardioSlice constructs, and a response to proarrhythmic drugs that is predictive of their effect in human patients.

Abstract: The RNaseA superfamily member Angiogenin (ANG) is a secreted protein involved in neovascularization, cell proliferation and stress response. Dysregulation of ANG expression is found in many cancers with poor prognosis and mutations in ANG are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. While the uptake and nuclear translocation of ANG is relatively well characterised, little is known about how it reaches the plasma membrane and its mode of secretion. We generated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines constitutively expressing wild type (WT) Hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tagged mouse Ang1 (mAng1), and two amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated ANG variants (C39W and K40I). Herein, we show that these cell lines secrete mAng1 into the culture media. Using small molecule inhibitors we probed the route taken between the endoplasmic reticulum and trans-Golgi network during secretion and have characterised it as COPII and microtubule dependent. In addition, we show that disruption by the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin of the later stages of transit to the plasma membrane leads to mAng1 trafficking to lysosomal compartments. This suggests an autophagy dependent regulation of secretion.

Proteases HtrA and HtrB for α-amylase secreted from Bacillus subtilis in secretion stress,

Abstract: HtrA and HtrB are two important proteases across species. In biotechnological industries, they are related to degradation of secreted heterologous proteins from bacteria, especially in the case of overproduction of α-amylases in Bacillus subtilis. Induction of HtrA and HtrB synthesis follows the overproduction of α-amylases in B. subtilis. This is different from the order usually observed in B. subtilis, i.e., the production of proteases is prior to the secretion of proteins. This discrepancy suggests three possibilities: (i) HtrA and HtrB are constantly synthesized from the end of the exponential phase, and then are synthesized more abundantly due to secretion stress; (ii) There is a hysteresis mechanism that holds HtrA and HtrB back from their large amount of secretion before the overproduction of α-amylases; (iii) Heterologous amylases could be a stress to B. subtilis leading to a general response to stress. In this review, we analyze the literature to explore these three possibilities. The first possibility is attributed to the regulatory pathway of CssR-CssS. The second possibility is because sigma factor σD plays a role in the overproduction of α-amylases and is subpopulation dependent with the switch between “ON” and “OFF” states that is fundamental for a bistable system and a hysteresis mechanism. Thus, sigma factor σD helps to hold HtrA and HtrB back from massive secretion before the overproduction of α-amylases. The third possibility is that several sigma factors promote the secretion of proteases at the end of the exponential phase of growth under the condition that heterologous amylases are considered as a stress.

Abstract: The highly invasive and metastatic properties of ovarian cancer make it the leading cause of death among gynecological cancers. Elevated levels of activin A and its receptors have been found in ovarian tumors and are associated with reduced survival in ovarian cancer patients. The role of activin A in promoting ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion has been previously reported, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we show that treatment of SKOV3 and OVISE cells with activin A decreases the expression of E-cadherin. These effects are completely diminished by inhibition or knockdown of the activin type I receptor. Treatment with activin A activates SMAD2/3 signaling but does not alter MEK-ERK1/2 or PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activity. Knockdown of SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 abolishes the downregulation of E-cadherin by activin A. Moreover, activin A treatment induces the expression of transcription factors SNAIL and SLUG, which mediate the suppressive effects of activin A on E-cadherin expression. Importantly, forced-expression of E-cadherin inhibits both basal and activin A-induced cell migration. Taken together, our results suggest that activin A downregulates E-cadherin expression by upregulating SLUG and SNAIL expression via SMAD2/3-SMAD4-dependent signaling. Loss of E-cadherin contributes to activin A-induced ovarian cancer cell migration.

Glucose impairs angiogenesis and promotes ventricular remodelling following myocardial infarction via upregulation of microRNA-17,

Abstract: Hyperglycaemia is known to impair angiogenesis, which may contribute to the poor prognosis of diabetic patients following myocardial infarction (MI). miR-17 has been reported to be involved in the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of a variety of vascular endothelial cells. However, how miR-17 regulates angiogenesis under hyperglycaemic conditions has not been reported. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-17 in the impairment of angiogenesis induced by high glucose. In vitro, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) transfected with miR-17 mimics or inhibitors were incubated with normal-glucose or high-glucose (HG) medium. In vivo, miR-17 or negative control antagomirs were administered by tail vein injection in an MI model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. MiR-17 was upregulated, while VEGFA was downregulated in MI mice with diabetes and in HUVECs exposed to HG. The luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that VEGFA is a target gene of miR-17. Moreover, inhibition of miR-17 prevented HG-induced VEGFA downregulation and impaired the capacity for migration and tube formation in HUVECs. Administration of miR-17 antagomirs significantly improved LV function and reduced infarct size in diabetic post-MI mice. Furthermore, the effects of diabetes-induced decreases in angiogenesis and VEGFA expression were abrogated by miR-17 antagomirs treatment in diabetic infarcted myocardium. These findings suggest that inhibition of miR-17 prevents HG-induced impairment of angiogenesis and improves cardiac function after MI by targeting VEGFA in diabetic mice.

Abstract: The metastasis-associated gene 1 (MTA1) has previously been recognized as an oncogene in many tumors, and aberrant MTA1 expression has been related to invasion and migration; however, its role and underlying molecular mechanism in oral squamous carcinoma (OSCC) remain largely unexplored. In this work, we determined the expression of MTA1 in OSCC tissues and cell lines. The effect of MTA1 on metastasis and the role of MTA1 in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OSCC cells were evaluated by assays both in vitro and in vivo. We also identified the key Hedgehog signaling pathway-related protein involved in the MTA1-induced EMT. We found that MTA1 expression was upregulated and positively related to the metastasis in OSCC tissues and cell lines. MTA1 overexpression promoted OSCC invasion, migration, and induced EMT, while its silencing had the opposite effect both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, our data further revealed the relevant molecular mechanism, Hedgehog(Hh) signaling pathway contributed to the effect of MTA1 on the aggressive phenotypes of OSCC cells.These findings indicate that MTA1 enhances OSCC cells invasion and migration by inducing EMT via the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which suggests MTA1 may be an effective anti-OSCC therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
The interferon γ-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) is known as immune sensor of retroviral DNA intermediates. We show that IFI16 restricts HIV-1 independently of immune sensing by binding and inhibiting the host transcription factor Sp1 that drives viral gene expression. This antiretroviral activity and ability to bind Sp1 require the N-terminal pyrin domain and nuclear localization of IFI16, but not the HIN domains involved in DNA binding. Highly prevalent clade C HIV-1 strains are more resistant to IFI16 and less dependent on Sp1 than other HIV-1 subtypes. Furthermore, inhibition of Sp1 by IFI16 or pharmacologically by Mithramycin A suppresses reactivation of latent HIV-1 in CD4+ T cells. Finally, IFI16 also inhibits retrotransposition of LINE-1, known to engage Sp1, and murine IFI16 homologs restrict Friend retrovirus replication in mice. Thus, IFI16 restricts retroviruses and retrotransposons by interfering with Sp1-dependent gene expression, and evasion from this restriction may facilitate spread of HIV-1 subtype C.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the contribution of adult neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and their lineage potential is a great challenge in neuroscience. To reveal progenitor diversity and cell-lineage relationships of postnatal NPCs in the subventricular zone (SVZ), we performed in vivo lineage-tracing genetic analysis using the UbC-StarTrack. We determined the progeny of single SVZ-NPCs, the number of cells per clone, the dispersion of sibling cells, and the cell types within clones. Long-term analysis revealed that both the cell-dispersion pattern and number of cells comprising clones varied depending on the glial/neuronal nature of sibling cells. Sibling-olfactory interneurons were primarily located within the same layer, while sibling-glial cells populated SVZ-adjacent areas. Sibling astrocytes and interneurons did not form big clones, whereas oligodendroglial-lineage clones comprised the largest clones originated in adult brains. These results demonstrate the existence of SVZ postnatal bipotential progenitors that give rise to clones widely dispersed across the olfactory bulb and SVZ-adjacent areas.

Abstract: Aims
To establish a KCNQ1 mutant-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model of a Chinese inherited long QT syndrome (LQTS) patient and to explore the pathogenesis of KCNQ1 mutations.
Methods and results
(1) Two patient-specific iPSC lines from the proband were obtained. (2) The experiments produced spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes (CMs) from patient iPSCs. Splicing mutation c. 605-2A > G in iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) resulted in the skipping of exon 4, exons 3-4, or exons 3-6 in KCNQ1 transcription what was observed in the patient's peripheral leukocytes. (3) Action potential duration (APD) at 50% and 90% repolarization (APD50 and APD90) of the patient's iPSC-derived ventricular-like-CMs was significantly longer than that of the control. Moreover, early after depolarization (EAD) and coupled beats were observed only in L1-iPSC-CMs. (4) A c.815G > A corrected iPSC line was obtained by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9) system.
Conclusion
(1) Cardiomyocytes with spontaneous pulsation were successfully differentiated from LQTS patient-specific iPSC lines. (2) For KCNQ1 splicing mutations, there is a chance that splicing patterns in peripheral leukocytes are similar to that in patient iPSC-CMs. (3) The truncated KCNQ1 proteins induced by such splicing mutation might cause Iks decrease, which in turn produced APD prolongation and triggered activities. (4) Our data showed that CRISPR-Cas9 system could be used to rescue the LQTS-related mutations.

Abstract: Transplantation of primary hepatocytes has been used in treatments for various liver pathologies and end-stage liver disease. However, shortage of donor tissue and the inability of hepatocyte proliferation in vitro have lead to alternative methods such as stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs). Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, and amniotic epithelial cells were isolated from human bone marrow (BM-MSCs), lipoaspirates (ASCs), and amniotic tissue (AECs) respectively. All cells were differentiated into HLCs on plates coated with Type I collagen or Porcine Liver Extracellular Matrix (PLECM-AA) matrix. Flow cytometry of BM-MSCs and ASCs, and AECs showed high expression of MSC-specific and embryonic stem cell markers respectively. All cell types differentiated into osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. All cell type-derived HLCs presented the typical cuboidal primary hepatocyte morphology on PLECM-AA and fewer vacuoles (AECs) compared to HLCs cultured on type I collagen. Gene analysis of all cell type-derived HLCs cultured on PLECM-AA revealed higher upregulation of genes involved in drug transportation and metabolism compared to HLCs cultured on type I collagen. Although, HLCs cultured on PLECM-AA displayed some hepatocyte-related function and bioactivity, overall gene expression was lower compared to that of primary hepatocytes suggesting that caution should be taken when considering using HLCs to replace total hepatocyte functionality.

Abstract: To investigate the pathogenesis of Kashin-Beck disease (KBD), we compared the common signaling pathways in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy juvenile and adults and KBD patients, and also from osteoarthritis (OA) patients. The PBMCs from 12 KBD and 12 healthy juvenile, and those from 20 adult KBD patients and 12 healthy donors were separately collected among the people living in the KBD endemic area. The patients were distinguished according to the national diagnosis criteria. Total RNAs were extracted for the determination of gene expressions by microarray analysis. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) was employed to identify the signaling pathways significantly affected by juveniles' and adults' KBD, and OA. The expressions of NFκB-p65, cIAP2 and RANKL in the articular cartilage from both juvenile and adults were detected by immunohistochemistry. NF-κB signaling, apoptosis signaling, death receptor signaling and IL-6 signaling pathways were revealed to be the common affected signaling pathways in the juvenile and adult KBD and the OA. BIRC3 and EGR1 were identified as two common differentially expressed genes. The percentages of positive staining of NFκB-p65, cIAP2 and RANKL were reduced in adult KBD patients but significantly increased in juvenile KBD patients. NF-κB, one of the common signaling pathways between adult and juvenile KBD, was less prominent in the adult KBD patients.

Abstract: Global climate change is predicted to intensify thermal stress in marine and coastal organisms, affecting their development, growth, and reproductive functions. In this study, we performed histological observations on ovarian development, immunohistochemical analyses of ovarian heat shock protein-70 (HSP70), nitrotyrosine protein (NTP, an indicator of reactive nitrogen species (RNS)), and dinitrophenyl protein (DNP, an indicator of protein oxidation) expressions, in situ TUNEL assay for cellular apoptosis, biochemical analyses of ovarian caspase-3/7 activity and protein carbonyl (PC, a measure of reactive oxygen species (ROS)) contents, nitrate/nitrite (NOx) levels, and extrapallial fluid (EPF, an important body fluid) pH in the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Oysters were exposed to medium (28 °C) and high (32 °C) temperatures under controlled laboratory conditions for 1 week. Oysters exposed to higher temperatures significantly decreased the number and diameter of eggs, and EPF protein concentrations compared with controls (24 °C). In contrast, EPF pH, ovarian HSP70 mRNA levels, and protein expression were increased after heat exposure, consistent with increased ovarian apoptosis. The enhanced apoptosis in ovaries was associated with increased ovarian caspase-3/7 activity, PC contents, NOx levels, and NTP and DNP expressions in heat-exposed oysters. Collectively, these results suggest that higher temperatures drastically increase RNS and ROS levels, increasing incidence of apoptosis and subsequently reducing ovarian functions in oysters.

Abstract: The proliferation and differentiation of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) is regulated by several signaling pathways, including BMP and PTEN. Therefore, this study intended to clarify the potential effects of two such regulators, BMP2 and PTEN, on HFSC differentiation. HFSCs were subjected to BMP2, noggin (BMP2 ligand inhibitor), rapamycin (Rapa, autophagy inducer), 3-methyladenine (3-MA, autophagy inhibitor), or shRNA against PTEN. The differentiation of HFSCs was evaluated using oil red O staining and autophagy was assessed using the transmission electron microscope. Then expression of epidermal differentiation marker (K10 and involucrin), adipogenic markers (PPAR-γ2, aP2, perilipin2, and Adipoq), keratinocyte-specific marker (K15), proliferation-related markers (PCNA and Ki67) and autophagy-related factors (Atg5, Atg7, Atg12, Beclin-1 and LC3-II/LC3-I) was examined by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Next, HFSCs were treated with 3-MA, or shRNA against Atg5 or Atg7 to verify the effect of autophagy on differentiation of BMP2-treated HFSCs. Finally, the effect of BMP2 on HFSC differentiation was verified by a mouse wound model. HFSCs overexpressing BMP2 exhibited elevated expression of epidermal differentiation marker, adipogenic markers and autophagy-related factors but inhibited expression of keratinocyte-specific marker and proliferation-related markers. Furthermore, we found that PTEN promoted the differentiation of BMP2-treated HFSCs by inducing autophagy. In vivo experiments further confirmed the roles of BMP2/PTEN on differentiation of HFSCs. Taken together, BMP2 up-regulated PTEN and consequently induced autophagy to facilitate HFSC differentiation.

Abstract: Sox2 is a master transcriptional regulator of embryonic development. In this study, we determined the protein interactome of Sox2 in the chromatin and nucleoplasm of mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. Apart from canonical interactions with pluripotency-regulating transcription factors, we identified interactions with several chromatin modulators, including members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family, suggesting a role for Sox2 in chromatin-mediated transcriptional repression. Sox2 was also found to interact with RNA binding proteins (RBPs), including proteins involved in RNA processing. RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed that Sox2 associates with different messenger RNAs, as well as small nucleolar RNA Snord34 and the non-coding RNA 7SK. 7SK has been shown to regulate transcription at gene regulatory regions, which could suggest a functional interaction with Sox2 for chromatin recruitment. Nevertheless, we found no evidence of Sox2 modulating recruitment of 7SK to chromatin when examining 7SK chromatin occupancy by Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP) in Sox2 depleted mES cells. In addition, knockdown of 7SK in mES cells did not lead to any change in Sox2 occupancy at 7SK-regulated genes. Thus, our results show that Sox2 extensively interacts with RBPs, and suggest that Sox2 and 7SK co-exist in a ribonucleoprotein complex whose function is not to regulate chromatin recruitment, but could rather regulate other processes in the nucleoplasm.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) is involved in lipid metabolism and lipotoxicity and can lead to apoptosis. Resveratrol, a sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) agonist, prevents ER stress and improves ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis and cell death. Clusterin is a secreted chaperone and has roles in various physiological processes. However, changes in the expression of clusterin upon ER stress and the connection between SIRT1 and clusterin in protection against ER stress are not well known. In cells treated with tunicamycin, resveratrol increased the expression of clusterin mRNA and protein and the secreted clusterin protein level in conditioned medium. Resveratrol decreased protein expression of the ER stress markers, p-PERK, p-IRE1α, and CHOP, and increased the expression of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) factors, SEL1L and HRD1, in tunicamycin-treated cells. However, no changes in the expression of these genes were observed in clusterin siRNA-transfected cells. Moreover, increased LAMP2 and LC3 expression and decreased Rubicon expression were observed in cells treated with resveratrol or secreted clusterin. These data suggest that SIRT1 activation by resveratrol attenuates ER stress by promoting protective processes such as ERAD and autophagy pathways and that these protective effects are mediated by clusterin.

Abstract: Exocrine glands share a common morphology consisting of ductal, acinar, and basal/myoepithelial cells, but their functions and mechanisms of homeostasis differ among tissues. Salivary glands are an example of exocrine glands, and they have been reported to contain multipotent stem cells that differentiate into other tissues. In this study, we purified the salivary gland stem/progenitor cells of adult mouse salivary glands using the cell surface marker CD133 by flow cytometry. CD133+ cells possessed stem cell capacity, and the transplantation of CD133+ cells into the submandibular gland reconstituted gland structures, including functional acinar. CD133+ cells were sparsely distributed in the intercalated and exocrine ducts and expressed Sox9 at higher levels than CD133– cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that Sox9 was required for the stem cell properties CD133+ cells, including colony and sphere formation. Thus, the Sox9-related signaling may control the regeneration salivary glands.

Abstract: Lysine demethylase 5B (KDM5B) is up-regulated in many cancers, including breast cancer. However, the underlying metabolic mechanisms of KDM5B on breast cancer progression are poorly understood. Here, we showed that KDM5B expression positively correlates with metastasis in breast cancer. Cell functional analyses were demonstrated that KDM5B knockdown and KDM5B inhibitor AS-8351 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore, we reported that KDM5B knockdown and AS-8351 reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreased the protein levels of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, we found that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway is involved in KDM5B-mediated EMT and lipid metabolism reprogramming in breast cancer cells. As a result, silencing of KDM5B-induced activation of AMPK signaling pathway inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Taken together, our findings indicated that KDM5B was a novel regulator of lipid metabolism reprogramming, and it was suggested a new strategy to treat breast cancer.

Abstract: The Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)) is an agricultural pest that threatens the potato industry worldwide. This insect is widely regarded as one of the most difficult-to-control pests, as it can thrive in a wide range of temperature conditions and routinely develops resistance towards various insecticides. The molecular changes associated with response to these challenges have not been fully investigated in L. decemlineata. While differential expression and characterization of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in response to stress have been conducted in several insects, data regarding HSPs in L. decemlineata are limited. The overarching objective of this study consisted of evaluating the expression of various HSPs in L. decemlineata exposed to different temperatures or treated with the insecticides imidacloprid and chlorantraniliprole. Expression levels of HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP Beta-1 were evaluated by qRT-PCR and insect mortality was assessed using dsRNAs aimed at select HSP targets. Elevated HSP70 and HSP90 transcript levels were observed in heat-exposed L. decemlineata while downregulation of HSP70 transcript levels was measured in insects submitted to cold conditions. Chlorantraniliprole exposure was associated with reduced HSP Beta-1 transcript levels while no change in expression was monitored in insects exposed to imidacloprid. RNAi-based knockdown of HSP60 levels correlated with significant insect mortality 14 days after dsRNA injection. These results highlight the modulation of HSPs that occur in L. decemlineata exposed to fluctuating temperatures and position HSPs as interesting candidates in the identification of novel molecular leads that could be targeted to control this insect.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and homeobox B9 (HOXB9) are both upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and are closely related to HCC invasion and metastasis. However, whether there is a regulatory relationship between GRP78 and HOXB9 is unclear. In this study, we examined the expression of GRP78 and HOXB9 in HCC tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues. Correlation analysis indicated that GRP78 and HOXB9 expression were positively correlated. High levels of GRP78 and HOXB9 expression are closely related to worse clinicopathological features. Knockdown of GRP78 in HCC cells decreased the mRNA and protein expression of HOXB9, but increase HOXB9 expression reversed the decrease in invasion and metastasis induced by knocking down GRP78. Further experiments showed that GRP78 regulates HOXB9 through the Wnt signaling pathway by chaperoning low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). Importantly, we found that GPR78 promoted maturation of LRP6, while knockdown of GRP78 led to LRP6 misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Consequently, the levels of mature LRP6 were reduced, and Wnt/HOXB9 signaling was inhibited. Our data suggest that the GRP78-LRP6-HOXB9 axis regulates the invasion and metastasis of HCC and may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Bone marrow (BM) niche cells help to keep adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in a quiescent state via secreted factors and induction of cell-cycle inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that the adapter protein CABLES1 is a key regulator of long-term hematopoietic homeostasis during stress and aging. Young mice lacking Cables1 displayed hyperproliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. This defect was cell intrinsic, since it was reproduced in BM transplantation assays using wild-type animals as recipients. Overexpression and short hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of CABLES1 protein resulted in p21Cip/waf up- and downregulation, respectively. Aged mice lacking Cables1 displayed abnormalities in peripheral blood cell counts accompanied by a significant reduction in HSC compartment, concomitant with an increased mobilization of progenitor cells. In addition, Cables1−/− mice displayed increased sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil due to an abnormal microenvironment. Altogether, our findings uncover a key role for CABLES1 in HSC homeostasis and stress hematopoiesis.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs in a sequence specific manner, thereby determining their degradation or inhibiting translation. They are involved in processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis by fine-tuning the expression of genes underlying such events. The expression of specific miRNAs is involved in hematopoietic differentiation and their deregulation contributes to the development of hematopoietic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). miR-130a is over-expressed in AML. Here we show that miR-130a is physiologically expressed in myeloblasts and down-regulated during monocyte differentiation. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments performed on CD34+ human hematopoietic stem cells confirmed that expression of miR-130a inhibits monocyte differentiation by interfering with the expression of key transcription factors HOXA10, IRF8, KLF4, MAFB and PU-1. The data obtained in this study highlight that the correct modulation of miR-130a is necessary for normal differentiation to occur and confirming that deregulation of this miRNA might underlie the differentiation block occurring in AML.

Abstract: Human papilloma virus oncogenes and estradiol are major etiologic factors associated with cervical cancer. In order to understand the mechanism by which these two factors promote carcinogenesis, the role of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway was evaluated during the normal growth of cervical epithelium and in the presence of E6/E7 oncogenes and exogenous estradiol. Hh signaling activity was determined in live animals (i.e., Gli-Luc reporter levels) during the estrous cycle and was found to be higher in the cervical area during the major growth phases, proestrus-estrus, in comparison to the diestrus phase. The same pattern was observed in transgenic mice expressing the E6/E7 oncogenes, though with notably higher levels than in control mice. Adding estradiol also markedly increased Gli activity in the cervix and the skin. In agreement with the correlation between high bioluminescence and tissue growth in different context, cervical cell proliferation was reduced upon Hh signaling inhibition in mice. Treatment with itraconazole, a putative novel Hh inhibitor, at an early stage of cervical carcinogenesis, did not decrease Hh signaling but it did reduce growth. Therefore, Hh signaling likely contributes to cervical carcinogenesis and itraconazole is effective to reduce growth but by a mechanism involving additional signaling pathways.

Abstract: Up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and its soluble form are involved in the chronic inflammation. For the first time, we demonstrated that resveratrol (RE), a natural polyphenol with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, reduces the increase of expression and release of ICAM-1, due to TNFα-induced oxidative stress, in a myofibroblast cell line derived from human colonic (18Co cells). RE is scavenger of radical oxygen species (ROS) and modulates signaling pathways in which Sirt-1 and NF-κB are involved. Effectively, in TNFα-stimulated 18Co cells RE decreases ROS production and increases Sirt-1 expression and activity, but it reduces TNFα-induced ICAM-1 up-regulation by a Sirt-1-independent mechanism, as demonstrated by EX527 and Sirt-1 siRNA treatments. RE inhibits TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB by reducing both ROS and the degradation of IκB-α, an endogenous inhibitor of NF-κB, with consequent decrease of NF-κB nuclear translocation. This study also shows that NF-κB is not the only factor involved in the TNFα-induced ICAM-1 up-regulation and confirms our previous evidence according to which TNFα increases ICAM-1 levels by redox- and non-redox-regulated mechanisms. RE can represent good and useful support in therapies for intestinal inflammatory diseases in which TNFα plays a crucial role in the increase of adhesion molecule expression.

Abstract: Summary
Disorders of bone healing and remodeling are indications with an unmet need for effective pharmacological modulators. We used a high-throughput screen to identify activators of the bone marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and discovered 6,8-dimethyl-3-(4-phenyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)quinolin-2(1H)-one (DIPQUO). DIPQUO markedly promotes osteoblast differentiation, including expression of Runx2, Osterix, and Osteocalcin. Treatment of human mesenchymal stem cells with DIPQUO results in osteogenic differentiation including a significant increase in calcium matrix deposition. DIPQUO stimulates ossification of emerging vertebral primordia in developing zebrafish larvae, and increases caudal fin osteogenic differentiation during adult zebrafish fin regeneration. The stimulatory effect of DIPQUO on osteoblast differentiation and maturation was shown to be dependent on the p38 MAPK pathway. Inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling or specific knockdown of the p38-β isoform attenuates DIPQUO induction of ALP, suggesting that DIPQUO mediates osteogenesis through activation of p38-β, and is a promising lead candidate for development of bone therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1), a type V CRISPR-associated nuclease, provides bacterial immunity against bacteriophages and plasmids but also serves as a tool for genome editing. Foreign nucleic acids are integrated into the CRISPR locus, prompting transcription of CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that guide Cas12a cleavage of foreign complementary DNA. However, mobile genetic elements counteract Cas12a with inhibitors, notably type V-A anti-CRISPRs (AcrVAs). We present cryoelectron microscopy structures of Cas12a-crRNA bound to AcrVA1 and AcrVA4 at 3.5 and 3.3 Å resolutions, respectively. AcrVA1 is sandwiched between the recognition (REC) and nuclease (NUC) lobes of Cas12a and inserts into the binding pocket for the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), a short DNA sequence guiding Cas12a targeting. AcrVA1 cleaves crRNA in a Cas12a-dependent manner, inactivating Cas12a-crRNA complexes. The AcrVA4 dimer is anchored around the crRNA pseudoknot of Cas12a-crRNA, preventing required conformational changes for crRNA-DNA heteroduplex formation. These results uncover molecular mechanisms for CRISPR-Cas12a inhibition, providing insights into bacteria-phage dynamics.

Abstract: Summary
Tissue homeostasis and repair relies on proper communication of stem cells and their differentiating daughters with the local tissue microenvironment. In the Drosophila male germline adult stem cell lineage, germ cells proliferate and progressively differentiate enclosed in supportive somatic cyst cells, forming a small organoid, the functional unit of differentiation. Here we show that cell polarity and vesicle trafficking influence signal transduction in cyst cells, with profound effects on the germ cells they enclose. Our data suggest that the cortical components Dlg, Scrib, Lgl and the clathrin-mediated endocytic (CME) machinery downregulate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Knockdown of dlg, scrib, lgl, or CME components in cyst cells resulted in germ cell death, similar to increased signal transduction via the EGFR, while lowering EGFR or downstream signaling components rescued the defects. This work provides insights into how cell polarity and endocytosis cooperate to regulate signal transduction and sculpt developing tissues.

Abstract: Summary
The process of oligodendrogenesis has been relatively well delineated in the rodent brain. However, it remains unknown whether analogous developmental processes are manifested in the human brain. Here we report oligodendrogenesis in forebrain organoids, generated by using OLIG2-GFP knockin human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) reporter lines. OLIG2/GFP exhibits distinct temporal expression patterns in ventral forebrain organoids (VFOs) versus dorsal forebrain organoids (DFOs). Interestingly, oligodendrogenesis can be induced in both VFOs and DFOs after neuronal maturation. Assembling VFOs and DFOs to generate fused forebrain organoids (FFOs) promotes oligodendroglia maturation. Furthermore, dorsally derived oligodendroglial cells outcompete ventrally derived oligodendroglia and become dominant in FFOs after long-term culture. Thus, our organoid models reveal human oligodendrogenesis with ventral and dorsal origins. These models will serve to study the phenotypic and functional differences between human ventrally and dorsally derived oligodendroglia and to reveal mechanisms of diseases associated with cortical myelin defects.

Abstract: Summary
Stem cell-based therapies have been proposed as a strategy to replace damaged tissues, especially in the nervous system. A primary sensory modality, olfaction, is impaired in 12% of the US population, but lacks treatment options. We report here the development of a novel mouse model of inducible hyposmia and demonstrate that purified tissue-specific stem cells delivered intranasally engraft to produce olfactory neurons, achieving recovery of function. Adult mice were rendered hyposmic by conditional deletion of the ciliopathy-related IFT88 gene in the olfactory sensory neuron lineage and following experimentally induced olfactory injury, received either vehicle or stem cell infusion intranasally. Engraftment-derived olfactory neurons were identified histologically, and functional improvements were measured via electrophysiology and behavioral assay. We further explored mechanisms in culture that promote expansion of engraftment-competent adult olfactory basal progenitor cells. These findings provide a basis for translational research on propagating adult tissue-specific sensory progenitor cells and testing their therapeutic potential.

Abstract: It is known that heat stress induces various physiological challenges in livestock production including changes in lipid metabolism. However, the molecular mechanism of how heat stress regulates lipid metabolism at the mRNA level is still largely unknown. N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) is the most common and abundant modification on RNA molecules present in eukaryotes, which affects almost all aspects of RNA metabolism and thus gives us the hint that it may participate in changes of gene expression of lipid metabolism during heat stress. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of heat stress on fat metabolism in 21-day Large White × Landrace piglets from sows challenged by heat stress from day 85 of gestation until day 21 of lactation. We measured the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), genes associated with lipid metabolism, m6A-related enzymes, and m6A levels in abdominal fat and liver of offspring piglets. Our results showed that high ambient temperature significantly increased the expression of HSP70 (P < 0.01) in both liver and abdominal fat and upregulated HSP27 in the liver (P < 0.05). Additionally, genes involved in fat metabolism such as ACACA, FASN, DGAT1, PPAR-γ, SREBP-1c, and FABP4 were upregulated in abdominal fat in the experimental group challenged by high ambient temperature. In the liver, heat stress increased the mRNA expression of DGAT1, SREBP-1c, and CD36 and decreased ATGL and CPT1A expression (P < 0.05). The m6A level was higher in the heat stress group compared with the control group in the liver and abdominal fat of offspring piglets (P < 0.01). Notably, heat stress also increased gene expression of METTL14, WTAP, FTO, and YTHDF2 (P < 0.05) in both abdominal fat and liver. The protein abundances of METTL3, METTL14, and FTO were upregulated after heat stress in abdominal fat (P < 0.05) but not in the liver. Although there was no difference in the protein abundance of YTHDF2 in abdominal fat, its level was increased in the liver (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our findings showed that heat stress increased expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, which provided scientific evidence to the observation of increased fatness in pigs under heat stress. We also demonstrated a possible mechanism that m6A RNA modification may be associated with these changes in lipid metabolism upon heat stress.

Abstract: Summary
A considerable number of complex peptides are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Due to their multimodular architecture and widely understood basic biosynthetic reactions, these synthetases represent a promising target for compound diversification by active reprogramming. Nevertheless, the limited knowledge about mechanistic details such as C domain specificity hampers rational synthetase engineering. Here, we present a systematic investigation of three fungal NRPS exchange units (C-A-Mt-T, CCTD-A-Mt-T, and A-Mt-T) focusing on the influence of C domains at heterologous domain junctions. By functionally integrating units from linear cyclosporine synthetase into iterative cyclodepsipeptide synthetases in vivo, we demonstrate that fungal NRPSs of different assembly types can be combined using different swapping sites, while respecting the C domain integrity and specificity. Based on 24 hybrid synthetases, we suggest exchange rules for efficient fungal NRPS engineering. The findings are of importance for rational synthetase design and provide a new set of options for combinatorial reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
The microbiota and the gastrointestinal mucus layer play a pivotal role in protection against non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) colitis. Here, we analyzed the course of Salmonella colitis in mice lacking a functional mucus layer in the gut. Unexpectedly, in contrast to mucus-proficient littermates, genetically deficient mice were protected against Salmonella-induced gut inflammation in the streptomycin colitis model. This correlated with microbiota alterations and enrichment of the bacterial phylum Deferribacteres. Using gnotobiotic mice associated with defined bacterial consortia, we causally linked Mucispirillum schaedleri, currently the sole known representative of Deferribacteres present in the mammalian microbiota, to host protection against S. Tm colitis. Inhibition by M. schaedleri involves interference with S. Tm invasion gene expression, partly by competing for anaerobic electron acceptors. In conclusion, this study establishes M. schaedleri, a core member of the murine gut microbiota, as a key antagonist of S. Tm virulence in the gut.

Abstract: We previously reported that Drosophila phagocytes enhance their phagocytic activity after apoptotic cell engulfment accompanied by the activation of the transcription repressor Tailless and an increase in the levels of engulfment receptors. We herein investigated the underlying mechanisms. We found that Tailless phosphorylation levels decreased in Drosophila phagocytes following the stimulation with apoptotic cells. Anticipating the involvement of another transcription repressor, we examined the possible involvement of Krüppel, a bibliographically identified repressor whose expression is controlled by Tailless. The level of Krüppel in phagocytes decreased after the stimulation in a Tailless-dependent manner. The RNAi knockdown of Krüppel abrogated increases in the levels of engulfment receptors and phagocytic activity in stimulated phagocytes. The binding of Krüppel to the 5′-upstream regions of genes coding for engulfment receptors was demonstrated. These results suggest the following pathway: Tailless is activated by de-phosphorylation; Krüppel expression is inhibited by Tailless; the transcription of engulfment receptors-encoding genes is augmented due to a decrease of inhibition by Krüppel; and finally phagocytic activity is enhanced.

Abstract: The decreased adhesion ability of melanocytes to the neighboring keratinocytes prompts melanocytes to lose from the epidermis, comprising the critical step in vitiligo pathogenesis. The repigmentation process involves the migration of melanocytes to the lesional area. This study aims to investigate the role and mechanism of microRNA (miR)-9 in the adhesion and migration of melanocytes during vitiligo repigmentation induced by UVB treatment. The HaCaT keratinocytes were used to mimic lesional condition and the PIG1 melanocytes as perilesional condition. Human lesional vitiligo specimens showed increased miR-9 and decreased adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin and β1 integrin. Furthermore, UVB exposure upregulated IL-10, E-cadherin, and β1 integrin, downregulated miR-9 in HaCaT cells. Moreover, the increased IL-10 by UVB exposure decreased miR-9 level by inducing miR-9 methylation via methyltransferase DNMT3A in HaCaT cells. Additionally, miR-9 targeted and inhibited E-cadherin and β1 integrin in HaCaT cells, and suppressed migration of PIG1 cells to UVB-exposed HaCaT cells. In conclusion, miR-9 was suppressed by IL-10 and inhibited migration of PIG1 cells to HaCaT cells during UVB-mediated vitiligo repigmentation.

Abstract: High-throughput functional assays of enhancer activity have recently enabled the genome-scale definition of molecular, structural, and biochemical features of these genomic regulatory regions. To infer the evolutionary origin of DNA sequences operating as functional enhancers in human embryonic stem cells (hESC), we examined the patterns of evolutionary conservation and divergence in the genome-wide functional enhancers' landscape of hESC. We show that a prominent majority (up to 94%) of DNA sequences identified in hESC as functional enhancers are conserved in humans and our closest evolutionary relatives, Chimpanzee and Bonobo. More than 91% of functional enhancers that are highly conserved in both Chimpanzee and Bonobo, are conserved among other Great Apes and >75% are conserved in the Rhesus genome. In striking contrast, <5% of DNA sequences operating in hESC as functional enhancers are conserved in rodents. Conserved in primates enhancers' sequences are complemented by 1619 sequences of enhancers that are specific to humans. Enhancers that harbor human-specific sequences appear enriched among the invariant enhancer module maintaining activity in different pluripotent states and these regions are associated with pluripotency- and embryonic-lineage-related genes. However, functional enhancers make up only a minority of all conserved in primates or human-specific transcription factor binding sites. Our analyses revealed that sequences that are conserved during ~8 million years of primate evolution dominate the genomic landscape of functional enhancers in both primed and naïve hESC. Collectively, these observations revealed thousands of evolutionarily conserved sequences that function as a core regulatory network in human embryonic stem cells which has recently undergone further extension after divergence of modern humans from our closest relatives, Chimpanzee and Bonobo.

Abstract: Autophagy is a cellular bulk degradation process used as an alternative source of energy and metabolites and implicated in various diseases. Inefficient autophagy in nutrient-deprived cancer cells would be beneficial for cancer therapy making its modulation valuable as a therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment, especially in combination with chemotherapy. Dipyridamole (DIP) is a vasodilator and antithrombotic drug. Its major effects involve the block of nucleoside uptake and phosphodiestesase inhibition, leading to increased levels of intracellular cAMP. Here we report that DIP increases autophagic markers due to autophagic flux blockage, resembling autophagosome maturation and/or closure impairment. Treatment with DIP results in an increased number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes and impairs degradation of SQSTM1/p62. As blockage of autophagic flux decreases the recycling of cellular components, DIP reduced the intracellular ATP levels in cancer cells. Autophagic flux blockage was neither through inhibition of lysosome function nor blockage of nucleoside uptake, but could be prevented by treatment with a PKA inhibitor, suggesting that autophagic flux failure mediated by DIP results from increased intracellular levels of cAMP. Treatment with DIP presented antiproliferative effects in vitro alone and in combination with chemotherapy drugs. Collectively, these data demonstrate that DIP can impair autophagic degradation, by preventing the normal autophagosome maturation, and might be useful in combination anticancer therapy.

Abstract: Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) have been recognized as key mediators of pancreatic fibrosis, a characteristic feature of chronic pancreatitis (CP). As a cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) has been identified to participate in tumorigenesis and organ development. However, its biological role in CP remains unknown. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the changed expression of SPOP in CP and to examine the effect on mice PSCs activation of SPOP. We found that SPOP was downregulated in the pancreatic tissues of cerulein-induced CP mice. siRNA-mediated knockdown of SPOP led to significant promotion in primary PSCs activity by activating the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB)/interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathway. In addition, we examined the effects of Fas-associated death domain (FADD), a proven SPOP substrate that activates NF-κB, on the regulation of PSCs activation. We found that FADD was downregulated by SPOP via interaction-mediated degradation, and was upregulated during PSCs activation. The promotion of PSCs activation in knocking down SPOP with siSPOP-1 were counteracted by knocking down FADD. The results suggest that the SPOP-induced inhibition of PSCs activation partially depended on FADD. These results highlight the importance of SPOP in CP and provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial biofilm infections are difficult to eradicate because of antibiotic insusceptibility and high recurrence rates. Biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a leading cause of bacterial keratitis, is facilitated by the bacterial Psl exopolysaccharide and associated with heightened virulence. Using intravital microscopy, we observed that neutrophilic recruitment to corneal infections limits P. aeruginosa biofilms to the outer eye surface, preventing bacterial dissemination. Neutrophils moved to the base of forming biofilms, where they underwent neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) in response to high expression of the bacterial type-3 secretion system (T3SS). NETs formed a barrier “dead zone,” confining bacteria to the external corneal environment and inhibiting bacterial dissemination into the brain. Once formed, ocular biofilms were resistant to antibiotics and neutrophil killing, advancing eye pathology. However, blocking both Psl and T3SS together with antibiotic treatment broke down the biofilm and reversed keratitis, suggesting future therapeutic strategies for this intractable infection.

Abstract: Summary
Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) and tRNAPyl have been extensively used for genetic-code expansion. A Methanosarcina mazei PylRS mutant bearing the Y306A and Y384F mutations (PylRS(Y306A/Y384F)) encodes various bulky non-natural lysine derivatives by UAG. In this study, we examined how PylRS(Y306A/Y384F) recognizes many amino acids. Among 17 non-natural lysine derivatives, Nɛ-(benzyloxycarbonyl)lysine (ZLys) and 10 ortho/meta/para-substituted ZLys derivatives were efficiently ligated to tRNAPyl and were incorporated into proteins by PylRS(Y306A/Y384F). We determined crystal structures of 14 non-natural lysine derivatives bound to the PylRS(Y306A/Y384F) catalytic fragment. The meta- and para-substituted ZLys derivatives are snugly accommodated in the productive mode. In contrast, ZLys and the unsubstituted or ortho-substituted ZLys derivatives exhibited an alternative binding mode in addition to the productive mode. PylRS(Y306A/Y384F) displayed a high aminoacylation rate for ZLys, indicating that the double-binding mode minimally affects aminoacylation. These precise substrate recognition mechanisms by PylRS(Y306A/Y384F) may facilitate the structure-based design of novel non-natural amino acids.

Abstract: Parkin is an ubiquitin ligase regulating mitochondrial quality control reactions, including the autophagic removal of depolarized mitochondria (mitophagy). Parkin-mediated protein ubiquitinations may be counteracted by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). We conducted a high-content imaging screen of Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria after siRNA mediated silencing of each DUB in Parkin overexpressing HeLa cells. Knockdown of the ubiquitin-specific protease USP36 led to delayed Parkin translocation while only slightly disturbing the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins, but final autophagic elimination of mitochondria was severely disrupted. The localization of the nucleolar USP36 was not altered during mitophagy. However, the marker for transcriptional active chromatin, histone 2B Lys120 mono-ubiquitination was found reduced in USP36-silenced cells undergoing mitophagy. We observed a reduction of the mRNA and protein levels of Beclin-1 and its associated autophagy-related key regulator ATG14L in USP36 knockdown cells. Importantly, transfection of active ATG14L into USP36-silenced cells significantly restored Parkin-dependent mitophagy. We propose USP36 as regulator for the Parkin-dependent mitophagy at least in part via the Beclin-1-ATG14L pathway.

Abstract: Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by protein-rich pulmonary edema, critical hypoxemia, and influx of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cells. There are currently no effective pharmacon therapies in clinical practice. Syndecan-1 in endothelial cells has potential to protect barrier function of endothelium and suppress inflammation response. Thus, the present study was to identify whether exosomes with encapsulation of syndecan-1 could achieve ideal therapeutic effects in ALI. Exosomes were isolated from the conditional medium of lentivirus-transfected mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (MPMVECs) and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blotting. ALI mouse models were induced via intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and treated with exosomes. Lung edema, inflammation, and glycocalyx thickness were examined. The possible mechanism was verified by immunoblotting in MPMVECs. The purified exosomes included SDC1-high-Exos and SDC1-low-Exos which loaded with up-regulated syndecan-1 and down-regulated syndecan-1 respectively. Compared with SDC1-low-Exos, administration of SDC1-high-Exos could ameliorate lung edema and inflammation, attenuate number of cells and protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and preserve glycocalyx. Furthermore, SDC1-high-Exos also mitigated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 following LPS challenge. In MPMVECs, SDC1-high-Exos decreased stress fiber formation and ameliorated monolayer hyper-permeability after LPS stimulation. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that FAK/p190RhoGAP/RhoA/ROCK/NF-κB signaling pathway may be involved in LPS-induced ALI. In conclusion, SDC1-high-Exos play a pivotal role in ameliorating LPS-stimulated ALI models and may be served as a potential therapeutic agent for clinical application in the future.

Abstract: The crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) gene of Portunus trituberculatus (Pt-CHH) consists of four exons and three introns spanning 3849 bp in size and generating two mature mRNA, Pt-CHH1, and Pt-CHH2. The primary gene transcript produces a cDNA encoding for the putative Pt-CHH2 from exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 and an alternative transcript encodes for a putative Pt-CHH1 peptide from exons 1, 2, and 4. A promoter fragment of about 3 kb was obtained by genomic walking. The tissue-specific expression pattern is examined by reverse transcriptase chain reaction, and the results show that Pt-CHH1 is detected in the eyestalk, brain, muscle, and blood. However, Pt-CHH2 is detected in the ganglia thoracalis and gill. The results indicate that the expression of Pt-CHH2 in the gill might suggest a potential role in osmoregulation. The Pt-CHH transcript level in the gill increases when the crab is exposed to low salinity. The injection of dsRNA for Pt-CHH causes a significant reduction in Pt-CHH2 transcript level and the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase, and carbonic anhydrase (CA) show a serious decrease. In conclusion, this study provides molecular evidence to support the osmoregulatory function of Pt-CHH2.

Abstract: Summary
Activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR)-associated transcription factor ATF6 has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce the secretion and subsequent toxic aggregation of destabilized, amyloidogenic proteins implicated in systemic amyloid diseases. However, the molecular mechanism by which ATF6 activation reduces the secretion of amyloidogenic proteins remains poorly defined. We employ a quantitative interactomics platform to define how ATF6 activation reduces secretion of a destabilized, amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain (LC) associated with light-chain amyloidosis (AL). Using this platform, we show that ATF6 activation increases the targeting of this destabilized LC to a subset of pro-folding ER proteostasis factors that retains the amyloidogenic LC within the ER, preventing its secretion. Our results define a molecular basis for the ATF6-dependent reduction in destabilized LC secretion and highlight the advantage for targeting this UPR-associated transcription factor to reduce secretion of destabilized, amyloidogenic proteins implicated in AL and related systemic amyloid diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Egg-based seasonal influenza vaccines are the major preventive countermeasure against influenza virus. However, their effectiveness can be compromised when antigenic changes arise from egg-adaptive mutations on influenza hemagglutinin (HA). The L194P mutation is commonly observed in egg-based H3N2 vaccine seed strains and significantly alters HA antigenicity. An approach to prevent L194P would therefore be beneficial. We show that emergence of L194P during egg passaging can be impeded by preexistence of a G186V mutation, revealing strong incompatibility between these mutations. X-ray structures illustrate that individual G186V and L194P mutations have opposing effects on the HA receptor-binding site (RBS), and when both G186V and L194P are present, the RBS is severely disrupted. Importantly, wild-type HA antigenicity is maintained with G186V, but not L194P. Our results demonstrate that these epistatic interactions can be used to prevent the emergence of mutations that adversely alter antigenicity during egg adaptation.

Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most severe complications of diabetes mellitus. The pathomolecular events behind DN remain uncertain. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) play essential functions in the development of DN. Meanwhile, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) also plays central roles in the regulation of renal function. However, the relationship between PPARs and 20-HETE is rarely studied in DN. It was revealed in our study that both PPARs expression and CYP4A-20-HETE level were decreased under DN conditions in vivo and in vitro. Supplementation with bezafibrate, a PPAR pan-agonist, improved the damage of kidney in DN mice and in high glucose-induced NRK-52E cells, following the up-regulation of PPARs and the increase of CYP4A-20-HETE. PPARα antagonist (MK886), PPARβ antagonist (GSK0660), and PPARγ antagonist (GW9662) reversed the protection of bezafibrate in NRK-52E, and abrogated the up-regulation of CYP4A-20-HETE produced by bezafibrate. Noteworthily, 20-HETE synthetase inhibitor, HET0016, also blocked the bezafibrate-mediated improvement of NRK-52E, and abolished the up-regulation of PPARs expression. Collectively, our data suggest that the concurrent down-regulation and interaction of PPARs and 20-HETE play crucial roles in the pathogenesis process of DN, and we provide a novel evidence that PPARs/20-HETE signaling may be served as a therapeutic target for DN patients.

Abstract: Summary
Immune targeting of (glyco)protein tumor markers has been useful to develop cancer and virus vaccines. However, the ganglioside family of tumor-associated glycolipids remains intractable to vaccine approaches. Here we show that synthetic antigens mimicking the carbohydrate moiety of GD2 or GD3 gangliosides can be used as vaccines to activate a selective humoral and cellular immunity that is therapeutic against several cancers expressing GD2 or GD3. Adoptive transfer of T cells generated after vaccination elicits tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of the γδ T cell receptor and CD8+ phenotypes; and affords a high therapeutic index. The glycomimetic vaccine principles can be expanded to target the family of tumor gangliosides and other carbohydrates expressed primarily in pathological states.

Abstract: Summary
Homogeneous antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that use a highly reactive buried lysine (Lys) residue embedded in a dual variable domain (DVD)-IgG1 format can be assembled with high precision and efficiency under mild conditions. Here we show that replacing the Lys with an arginine (Arg) residue affords an orthogonal ADC assembly that is site-selective and stable. X-ray crystallography confirmed the location of the reactive Arg residue at the bottom of a deep pocket. As the Lys-to-Arg mutation is confined to a single residue in the heavy chain of the DVD-IgG1, heterodimeric assemblies that combine a buried Lys in one arm, a buried Arg in the other arm, and identical light chains, are readily assembled. Furthermore, the orthogonal conjugation chemistry enables the loading of heterodimeric DVD-IgG1s with two different cargos in a one-pot reaction and thus affords a convenient platform for dual-warhead ADCs and other multifaceted antibody conjugates.

Abstract: Summary
Gain of 20q11.21 is one of the most common recurrent genomic aberrations in human pluripotent stem cells. Although it is known that overexpression of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-xL confers a survival advantage to the abnormal cells, their differentiation capacity has not been fully investigated. RNA sequencing of mutant and control hESC lines, and a line transgenically overexpressing Bcl-xL, shows that overexpression of Bcl-xL is sufficient to cause most transcriptional changes induced by the gain of 20q11.21. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes in mutant and Bcl-xL overexpressing lines are enriched for genes involved in TGF-β- and SMAD-mediated signaling, and neuron differentiation. Finally, we show that this altered signaling has a dramatic negative effect on neuroectodermal differentiation, while the cells maintain their ability to differentiate to mesendoderm derivatives. These findings stress the importance of thorough genetic testing of the lines before their use in research or the clinic.

Abstract: Sepsis is characterized as exceed inflammation response and multiple organs dysfunction. Many articles suggested that mesenchymal stem cells can alleviate the inflammation and improve the survival rate of inflammatory animal models, however, the mechanism is still unclear. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that rat adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) produce a amount of soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1), which ameliorated liver injury and inflammation and increased the survival rate of septic rat model.120 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham-operated (Sham), sepsis-induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), shNC (injected 1 × 106 ADMSCs with transfected with scramble shRNA 1 h after CLP), and shsTNFR1 (injected 1 × 106 ADMSCs with transfected with sTNFR1 1 h after CLP). The serum sTNFR1 levels were the lowest in Sham and highest in shNC group. ADMSCs could decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, AP-1 c-jun and NF-κB p56 after CLP administration, whereas this result was weaken by shsTNFR1 administration. Moreover, shNC had an increased levels of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 compared with CLP, and this change could be weakened in shsTNFR1 administration. More importantly, ADMSCs could improve the survival rate of CLP-induced septic rats. Therapeutically administered ADMSCs secrete sTNFR1, which alleviated the liver injury and inflammatory response. Additionally, ADMSCs also ameliorated the systematic inflammation and increased the survival rate of septic rats.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular responses to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) depend on cell context. Here, we explored how TGF-β/nodal signaling crosstalks with the epigenome to promote mesendodermal differentiation. We find that expression of a group of mesendodermal genes depends on both TRIM33 and nodal signaling in embryoid bodies (EBs) but not in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Only in EBs, TRIM33 binds these genes in the presence of expanded H3K18ac marks. Furthermore, the H3K18ac landscape at mesendodermal genes promotes TRIM33 recruitment. We reveal that HDAC1 binds to active gene promoters and interferes with TRIM33 recruitment to mesendodermal gene promoters. However, the TRIM33-interacting protein p300 deposits H3K18ac and further enhances TRIM33 recruitment. ATAC-seq data demonstrate that TRIM33 primes mesendodermal genes for activation by maintaining chromatin accessibility at their regulatory regions. Altogether, our study suggests that HDAC1 and p300 are key factors linking the epigenome through TRIM33 to the cell context-dependent nodal response during mesendodermal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Kidney formation is regulated by the balance between maintenance and differentiation of nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). Now that directed differentiation of NPCs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be achieved, maintenance and propagation of NPCs in vitro should be beneficial for regenerative medicine. Although WNT and FGF signals were previously shown to be essential for NPC propagation, the requirement for BMP/TGFβ signaling remains controversial. Here we reveal that activin has superior effects to BMP7 on maintenance efficiency of human iPSC-derived NPCs. Activin expanded ITGA8+/PDGFRA−/SIX2-GFP+ NPCs by 5-fold per week at 80%–90% efficiency, and the propagated cells possessed robust capacity for nephron formation both in vitro and in vivo. The expanded cells also maintained their nephron-forming potential after freezing. Furthermore, the protocol was applicable to multiple non-GFP-tagged iPSC lines. Thus, our activin-based protocol will be applicable to a variety of research fields including disease modeling and drug screening.

Abstract: Insulin resistance is a significant feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus and glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. Activation of NF-κB signaling pathway plays an important role in the formation of insulin resistance. FoxO1 plays a major role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as insulin signaling pathway. Previous studies have shown that Progestin and AdipoQ Receptor 3 (PAQR3) suppresses the activity of PI3K/Akt, which is an upstream pathway of FoxO1, and additionally promotes the pathological process of diabetic renal inflammatory fibrosis via activating NF-κB pathway. On this basis, it has caused us great concern whether NF-κB is involved in PAQR3 regulation of FoxO1 under insulin resistance. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether PAQR3 regulates phosphorylation of FoxO1 via NF-κB pathway in palmitic acid (PA)-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, thereby causing glucose and lipid metabolism disorders. We found that PA stimulation and PAQR3 overexpression decreased the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of glucokinase (GCK) and low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), in addition, promoted the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB. Inhibition of NF-κB pathway increased the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of GCK and LDLR which were downregulated by PA stimulation and PAQR3 overexpression. Taken together, in PA-induced insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, PAQR3 might regulate the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and the expressions of GCK and LDLR through NF-κB pathway, thereby regulating the glucose and lipid metabolism disorders induced by insulin resistance.

Abstract: Autophagy has been shown to be critically associated with the central mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease (PD), while the mechanisms contributing to the imbalance of autophagy remain unclear. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1), a well-studied long noncoding RNA, has been reported to be significantly increased in PD. The potential biological functions of SNHG1 in the regulation of neuronal autophagy and cell death in PD, however, have not yet been completely elucidated. In this study, we examined the existence of regulatory networks involving SNHG1, the miR-221/222 cluster and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B/p27)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in PD. We observed that SNHG1 expression was gradually upregulated in PD cellular and animal models. Furthermore, silencing SNHG1 promoted autophagy and prevented MPP+-induced cell death, similar to the overexpression of the miR-221/222 cluster. Mechanistically, SNHG1 competitively binds to the miR-221/222 cluster and indirectly regulates the expression of p27/mTOR. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that downregulation of SNHG1 attenuated MPP+-induced decreases in LC3-II (an autophagic marker) levels and cytotoxicity through the miR-221/222/p27/mTOR pathway, suggesting that SNHG1 may be a therapeutic target for neuroprotection and disease treatment in PD.

Abstract: Summary
GATA2 is essential for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) and generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). It is poorly understood how GATA2 controls the development of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived HS-like cells. Here, using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in which GATA2 overexpression was induced by doxycycline (Dox), we elucidated the dual functions of GATA2 in definitive hematopoiesis before and after the emergence of CD34+CD45+CD90+CD38– HS-like cells. Specifically, GATA2 promoted expansion of hemogenic precursors via the EHT and then helped to maintain HS-like cells in a quiescent state by regulating cell cycle. RNA sequencing showed that hPSC-derived HS-like cells were very similar to human fetal liver-derived HSCs.

Abstract: Retinal organoids (ROs) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells recapitulate the three-dimensional structure of retina, mimic human retinal development, and provide cell sources for pre-clinical retinal transplantation. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is crucial for normal outer retinal physiology, including phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments and secretion of neurotrophic and vasculotrophic growth factors. However, whether ROs-RPE co-culture can improve the differentiation of photoreceptors in ROs in vitro remains unknown. Herein, primary mouse RPE cells were contact co-cultured with ROs at different time points. Our results revealed that the RPE cells accelerated photoreceptor differentiation in ROs, as the cross talk between the RPE and ROs promoted the stage specific expression of photoreceptor markers at different differentiation stages. Thus, we established an improved co-culture system based on modeling of human retina-RPE dynamics during retinogenesis for the evaluation of ocular therapies.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely documented for their potential role in the treatment of various clinical disorders, including acute lung injury (ALI). ALI represents a clinical syndrome associated with histopathological diffuse alveolar damage. Recent evidence has demonstrated that exosomes derived from MSCs may serve as a reservoir of anti-apoptotic microRNAs (miRs) conferring protection from certain diseases. Hence, the current study was performed with the aim of investigating whether MSCs-exosomal miR-30b-3p could confer protection against ALI. A bioinformatic analysis and a dual luciferase assay were initially performed to verify that SAA3 was highly-expressed in ALI which was confirmed to be a target gene of miR-30b-3p. Next, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) (MLE-12) were transfected with mimics or inhibitors of miR-30b-3p, or sh-SAA3. It was revealed that LPS induced AEC apoptosis, which could be inhibited by overexpressing miR-30b-3p by down-regulating the expression of SAA3. After co-culture of PKH26-labeled exosomes with MLE-12 cells, we found that the number of PKH26-labeled exosomes endocytosed by MLE-12 cells gradually increased. Furthermore, the LPS-treated MLE-12 cells co-cultured with MSC-exosomes overexpressing miR-30b-3p exhibited increased miR-30b-3p, decreased SAA3 level, as well as increased cell proliferation, accompanied by diminished cell apoptosis in LPS-treated MLE-12 cells. Finally, the protective effect of MSCs-exosomal miR-30b-3p on the AECs in vivo was investigated in an ALI mouse model with tail vein injection of MSC-exosomes with elevated miR-30b-3p, showing that overexpression of miR-30b-3p in MSC-exosomes conferred protective effects against ALI. Taken together, these findings highlighted the potential of MSC-exosomes overexpressing miR-30b-3p in preventing ALI. The exosomes derived from MSCs hold potential as future therapeutic strategies in the treatment of ALI.

Abstract: Multiple myeloma is an incurable cancer of antibody-producing plasma cells. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a cytokine aberrantly expressed in half of myeloma patients, is involved in myeloma pathogenesis by enhancing myeloma growth and invasiveness, and may play a role in myeloma bone disease by inhibiting osteoblastogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play a role in HGF signaling between myeloma cells and osteoblast-like target cells. EVs from the HGF-positive cell line JJN-3 and the HGF-negative cell line INA-6, and from bone marrow plasma and primary human myeloma cells, were isolated using sequential centrifugation techniques and the presence of HGF on the EV-surface was investigated with ELISA. EVs from both cell lines were added to an established bioassay where HGF is known to induce interleukin-11 secretion in osteoblast-like cells. Our results show that HGF was bound to the surface of JJN-3-derived EVs, while INA-6-derived EVs were negative for HGF. Only JJN-3-derived EVs induced IL-11 secretion in osteoblast-like recipient cells. When osteoblast-like cells were preincubated with a specific HGF-receptor (c-Met) inhibitor, no induction of interleukin-11 was observed. Downstream c-Met phosphorylation was demonstrated by immunoblotting. EVs isolated from bone marrow plasma and primary myeloma cells were HGF-positive for a subset of myeloma patients. Taken together, this work shows for the first time that HGF bound on the surface of myeloma-derived EVs can effectuate HGF/c-Met signaling in osteoblast-like cells. Myeloma-derived EVs may play a role in myeloma bone disease by induction of the osteoclast-activating cytokine interleukin-11 in osteoblasts.

Abstract: The removal of introns from mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression. The splicing machinery heavily contributes to biological complexity and especially to the ability of cells to adapt to altered cellular conditions. Hypoxia also plays a key role in the pathophysiology of many disease states. Recent studies have revealed that tumorigenesis and hypoxia involve large-scale alterations in alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Cancer associated Fas protein plays a central role in the physiological regulation of programmed cell death and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various malignancies and diseases of the immune system. Fas pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced by excluding exon 6 to produce soluble Fas (sFas) protein that lacks a transmembrane domain and acts by inhibiting Fas mediated apoptosis. Another cancer related protein Rac1 plays an important regulatory role specifically in cells’ motility, growth and survival. Rac pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced to produce Rac1b protein, which is upregulated in metastatic diseases. In the present study we, for the first time, show that anti-apoptotic Fas mRNA isoform formation is regulated by cellular microenvironment - hypoxia. Hypoxic microenvironment, however, does not influence Rac1 pre-mRNAs alternative splicing. Also our presented results indicate that splicing factors hnRNP A1 and SPF45, previously shown to regulate Fas alternative splicing in normoxic cells, are not involved in hypoxia dependent alternative Fas pre-mRNA splicing regulation in an amount dependent manner. Our observations on hypoxia dependent alternative Fas pre-mRNA splicing regulation indicate a probable involvement of other, yet unidentified splicing factors. Presented data also shows the contribution of pre-mRNA splicing to cell survival under unfavorable conditions.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) alters the fibroblast phenotype by promoting transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts, which exhibit the ability to promote collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, thereby playing a significant role in the pathology of silicosis. In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms involved in myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor α (RhoGDIα) was upregulated following myofibroblast transdifferentiation stimulated by TGF-β1. We hypothesised that RhoGDIα may induce myofibroblast transdifferentiation and thus result in silicosis. Accordingly, the biological significance of RhoGDIα in cell proliferation and apoptosis was investigated by deletion of RhoGDIα in MRC-5 cells. In addition, a mechanistic study showed that fasudil, an inhibitor of the RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) signalling pathway, reduced the levels of RhoGDIα, RhoA, and phospho-myosin phosphatase （phospho-MYPT） in MRC-5 cells and silicosis model rats. Knockdown of RhoGDIα inhibited myofibroblast transdifferentiation and collagen deposition through RhoGDIα/RhoA/ROCK signalling in silicosis model mice. Overall, downregulation of RhoGDIα may significantly promote cell apoptosis and inhibit cell growth, resulting in reversal of myofibroblast transdifferentiation by RhoA/ROCK in vitro and in vivo. These data will facilitate further exploration of the potential use of RhoGDIα as a target for silicosis therapy.

Abstract: The multiple roles of microRNA-204-5p (miR-204-5p) in numerous types of cancer have been reported, but its function in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (RIRI) remains unclear. In this study, we aim to explore whether miR-204-5p was implicated in the RIRI in mice via regulating the Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) pathway. Firstly, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to screen RIRI-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then, RIRI mouse model was established, and the role of miR-204-5p and FasL in RIRI was explored by ectopic expression, depletion and reporter assay experiments. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) levels in serum, as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in renal tissues of mice were also measured. Afterwards, the regulatory role of miR-204-5p on Fas/FasL pathway in RIRI was investigated. Renal tissues from RIRI mice showed lower miR-204-5p expression and higher Fas and FasL expression. FasL was identified as a direct target gene of miR-204-5p. In addition, the increased levels of BUN, Scr and MDA, as well as decreased levels of SOD and GSH-Px in RIRI mice were reversed by elevation of miR-204-5p and blockage of the Fas/FasL pathway. Taken together, this study demonstrated that increased miR-204-5p might suppress RIRI in mice through suppressing Fas/FasL pathway by targeting FasL.

Abstract: Cognitive issues in stroke arise as a result of reperfusion of a clogged artery, which is reported to exacerbate the injury in the brain leading to oxidative stress. Through the present work, we try to understand the regional variations across brain regions mainly cortex and striatum associated with the progression of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). In a rat model of IRI, the influence of varying ischemia and reperfusion times on the biochemical phases across the brain regions were monitored. IRI resulted in the blood-brain barrier disruption and developed mild areas of risk. The brain’s tolerance towards IRI indicated a progressive trend in the injury and apoptosis from ischemia to reperfusion that was supported by the activities of plasma lactate dehydrogenase and tissue caspase-3. Cognitive impairment in these rats was an implication of cellular oxidative stress (higher lipid peroxidation and lower antioxidant enzyme activity) that persisted by 24-h reperfusion. The oxidative stress was prominent in the cortex than the striatum and was supported by the lower ATP level. Upregulated Mn-SOD expression leading to a preserved mitochondria in the striatum could be attributed to the regional protection. Overall, a progression of IRI was observed from striatum to cortex leading to 5-day cognitive decline.

Abstract: Summary
Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) are highly antibiotic-resistant and readily transmissible pathogens that cause severe infections in hospitalized patients. We discovered that lithocholic acid (LCA), a secondary bile acid prevalent in the cecum and colon of mice and humans, impairs separation of growing VRE diplococci, causing the formation of long chains and increased biofilm formation. Divalent cations reversed this LCA-induced switch to chaining and biofilm formation. Experimental evolution in the presence of LCA yielded mutations in the essential two-component kinase yycG/walK and three-component response regulator liaR that locked VRE in diplococcal mode, impaired biofilm formation, and increased susceptibility to the antibiotic daptomycin. These mutant VRE strains were deficient in host colonization because of their inability to compete with intestinal microbiota. This morphotype switch presents a potential non-bactericidal therapeutic target that may help clear VRE from the intestines of dominated patients, as occurs frequently during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Aiming at clinical translation, robust directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), preferentially in chemically defined conditions, is a key requirement. Here, feasibility of suspension culture based hPSC-cardiomyocyte (hPSC-CM) production in low-cost, xeno-free media compatible with good manufacturing practice standards is shown. Applying stirred tank bioreactor systems at increasing dimensions, our advanced protocol enables routine production of about 1 million hPSC-CMs/mL, yielding ∼1.3 × 108 CM in 150 mL and ∼4.0 × 108 CMs in 350–500 mL process scale at >90% lineage purity. Process robustness and efficiency is ensured by uninterrupted chemical WNT pathway control at early stages of differentiation and results in the formation of almost exclusively ventricular-like CMs. Modulated WNT pathway regulation also revealed the previously unappreciated role of ROR1/CD13 as superior surrogate markers for predicting cardiac differentiation efficiency as soon as 72 h of differentiation. This monitoring strategy facilitates process upscaling and controlled mass production of hPSC derivatives.

Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a group of highly aggressive malignancies with a 5-year overall survival of less than 40%. Cell overgrowth with defective apoptosis is a hallmark of AML, but little is known about how it occurs. Here, we show that aberrant activation of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1) encoded by POLR2A gene is critically involved in this hallmark. We retrospectively analyzed the expression profiles of POLR2A and RPB1 in a panel of AML cell lines, primary AML patients and peripheral blood samples. Meanwhile, correlation analysis was used to explore the correlation between the expression of RPB1 with tumor burden and overall survival time in untreated AML samples. RNA-Seq approach was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes between RPB1 silencing AML cells with control cells after knocking out RPB1. Furthermore, orthotopic AML models were established with RPB1 silencing and control cells to investigate the effects of RPB1 protein level on leukemia cell growth. In most AML patients, RPB1 was aberrantly activated and closely associated with poor prognosis, but not in normal hematopoietic cells. Global transcriptomic analysis revealed that POLR2A knockout strongly impaired growth of AML cells by selectively depleting a substantial set of AML-related oncogenic and anti-apoptosis genes such as MYC, RUNX2, MEIS1, CDC25A and BCL-2. Silencing RPB1 by genetic technology led to a potent regression of human refractory AML in mouse models. These findings reveal that dysregulated RPB1 is a central oncogenic hub that drives overgrowth by hijacking an array of oncogenic and anti-apoptosis factors. Targeting RPB1 is a potential therapeutic for treating AML.

Abstract: Summary
A simple induction protocol to differentiate chondrocytes from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) using small-molecule compounds is beneficial for cartilage regenerative medicine and mechanistic studies of chondrogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that chondrocytes are robustly induced from human PSCs by simple combination of two compounds, CHIR99021, a glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor, and TTNPB, a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonist, under serum- and feeder-free conditions within 5–9 days. An excellent differentiation efficiency and potential to form hyaline cartilaginous tissues in vivo were demonstrated. Comprehensive gene expression and open chromatin analyses at each protocol stage revealed step-by-step differentiation toward chondrocytes. Genome-wide analysis of RAR and β-catenin association with DNA showed that retinoic acid and Wnt/β-catenin signaling collaboratively regulated the key marker genes at each differentiation stage. This method provides a promising cell source for regenerative medicine and, as an in vitro model, may facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying chondrocyte differentiation.

Abstract: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive, irreversible inflammatory and fibrotic disease. The characteristics of this disease are progressive inflammation, acinar atrophy and fibrosis. Numerous factors are involved in CP such as inflammation, and oxidative stress. Recently, it has been noted that fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) reduced the severity of acute pancreatitis in mice. However, whether FGF-21 has effects on CP remains unclear. Thus, the present study was undertaken to detect the effects of FGF-21 on l-arginine induced chronic pancreatitis/islet fibrosis in mice. We used l-arginine to create a CP model in C57BL/6 mice and treated these mice with FGF-21. Compared to normal mice, blood glucose and intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) revealed significant impairment in CP animal model. CP mice also had acinar atrophy, loss of pancreas morphology, inflammatory cells infiltration, extensive deposition of collagen, elevated <alpha>-SMA expression, collagen I expression, serum amylase activity, MPO activity and MDA level. All these pathological changes were significantly improved by FGF-21 treatment. Moreover, FGF-21 ameliorated inflammatory state in the serum, pancreas and peritoneal macrophages of CP mice. Furthermore, we also found that FGF-21 could regulate differentiation of macrophages so as to improve pancreatic fibrogenesis in CP mice. Taken together, our study identifies the beneficial role of FGF-21 in CP and suggests that FGF-21 improves pancreatic fibrogenesis in CP via the mTOR pathway.

Abstract: Adipose tissue plays a role in energy storage and metabolic balance and is composed of different cell types. The metabolic activity of the tissue itself has been a matter of research for a long time, but comparative data about the energy metabolism of different cell types of human subcutaneous adipose tissue are sparse. Therefore, we compared the activity of major energy metabolic pathways of adipocytes and CD34+ cells from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) separated from the same tissue. This CD34+ cell fraction is enriched with adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal progenitors, as they account for the largest proportion of CD34+ cells of the SVF. Adipocytes displayed significantly higher mitochondrial enzyme capacities compared to CD34+ SVF-cells, as shown by the higher activities of isocitrate dehydrogenase and ß-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Inversely, the CD34+ SVF-cells showed higher capacities for cytosolic carbohydrate metabolism, represented by the activity of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Thus, the CD34+ SVF-cells may ensure the provision of pentose phosphates and reduction equivalents for the replication of DNA during proliferation. The data indicate that these two cell fractions of the human adipose tissue vary in their metabolic configuration adapted to their physiological demands regarding proliferation and differentiation in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Long-term survival and integration of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) transplanted following spinal cord injury (SCI) have been observed. However, questions concerning the differentiation choice, the mechanism of action, and the contribution of NPCs to functional recovery remains unanswered. Therefore, we investigated the differentiation of NPCs, global transcriptomal changes in transplanted NPCs, the effect of NPCs on neuroinflammation, and the causality between NPC transplantation and functional recovery. We found that NPCs transplanted following SCI differentiate mainly into oligodendrocytes and enhance myelination, upregulate genes related to synaptic signaling and mitochondrial activity, and downregulate genes related to cytokine production and immune system response. NPCs suppress the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines; moreover, NPC ablation confirm that NPCs were responsible for enhanced recovery in hindlimb locomotor function. Understanding the reaction of transplanted NPCs is important for exploiting their full potential. Existence of causality implies that NPCs are useful in the treatment of SCI.

Abstract: Breast cancer is frequently diagnosed in women and poses a major health problem throughout the world. Currently, the unresponsiveness of cancer cells to chemotherapeutics is a major concern. During chemotherapeutic treatment with Doxorubicin, neighbouring cells in the tumor microenvironment are also damaged. Depending on the concentration of Doxorubicin, apoptotic or senescent fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment can then secrete a variety of bioactive molecules which promote tumor growth, metastasis and drug resistance. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were treated with Doxorubicin to induce apoptosis and senescence respectively. Conditioned media was collected from the MEFs and was used to assess the paracrine effects between fibroblasts and E0771 murine breast cancer cells. Senescent fibroblasts significantly increased cell viability in E0771 cells following Doxorubicin treatment by activating Akt and ERK. Autophagy contributed to cancer cell death and not to treatment resistance in breast cancer cells. Our results highlight the complexity of the tumor microenvironment where chemotherapeutic agents such as Doxorubicin can induce significant changes fibroblasts which can affect tumor growth via the secretion of paracrine factors. Here we have demonstrated that those secreted paracrine factors enhance breast cancer growth and induce therapeutic resistance through the evasion of apoptotic cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Naturally occurring pradimicins (PRMs) show specific recognition of d-mannose (d-Man) in aqueous media, which has never been achieved by artificial small molecules. Although the Ca2+-mediated dimerization of PRMs is essential for their d-Man binding, the dimeric structure has yet to be elucidated, leaving the question open as to how PRMs recognize d-Man. Thus, we herein report the structural elucidation of the dimer by a combination of X-ray crystallography and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Coupled with our previous knowledge regarding the d-Man binding geometry of PRMs, elucidation of the dimer allowed reliable estimation of the mode of d-Man binding. Based on the binding model, we further developed an azide-functionalized PRM derivative (PRM-Azide) with d-Man binding specificity. Notably, PRM-Azide stained Candida rugosa cells having mannans on their cell surface through conjugation with the tetramethylrhodamine fluorophore. The present study provides the practical demonstration that PRMs can serve as lectin mimics for use in glycobiological studies.

Abstract: Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess endogenous reparative properties and may serve as an exogenous therapeutic intervention in patients with chronic kidney disease. Cardiovascular risk factors clustering in the metabolic syndrome (MetS) might adversely affect cellular properties. To test the hypothesis that Mets interferes with MSC characteristics, we performed comprehensive comparison of the mRNA, microRNA, and protein content of MSCs isolated from Lean and MetS pigs.
Methods
Domestic pigs were fed a 16-week Lean or MetS diet (n = 4 each). Expression profiles of co-existing microRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins were obtained by high-throughput sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. TargetScan and ComiR were used to predict target genes of differentially expressed microRNAs, and DAVID 6.7 for functional annotation analysis to rank primary gene ontology categories for the microRNA target genes, mRNAs, and proteins.
Results
Differential expression analysis revealed 12 microRNAs upregulated in MetS-MSCs compared to Lean-MSCs (fold change>1.4, p < .05), which target 7728 genes, whereas 33 mRNAs and 78 proteins were downregulated (fold change<0.7, p < .05). Integrated analysis showed that targets of those microRNAs upregulated in MetS-MSCs overlap with at least half of mRNAs and proteins dysregulated in those cells. Functional analysis of overlapping mRNAs and proteins suggest that they are primarily involved in mitochondria, inflammation and transcription. MetS-MSCs also exhibited increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B, associated with increased SA-β-Galactosidase and decreased cytochrome-c oxidase-IV activity.
Conclusion
MetS alters the transcriptome and proteome of swine adipose tissue-derived MSCs particularly genes involved in mitochondria, inflammation and transcription regulation. These alterations might limit the reparative function of endogenous MSC and their use as an exogenous regenerative therapy.

Abstract: Aberrant activation of MEKK-MEK-ERK signaling is frequently observed in lung cancer. Several inhibitors, which target this pathway, have shown clinical potential for the lung cancer treatment. Better understanding the regulation of this pathway would help the development of treatment strategies. In this study, we have identified the DIAPH3 as an up-regulated gene in lung adenocarcinoma. DIAPH3 promoted the growth of lung cancer cells both in the liquid culture and in the soft agar, and knockdown DIAPH3 inhibited the tumorigenesis both in the nude mice and in the de novo mouse model. In the molecular mechanism study, DIAPH3 was identified as the binding protein of STK38, impaired the interaction between STK38 and MEKK, and activated ERK signaling. Taken together, this study demonstrated the oncogenic roles of DIAPH3 in the tumorigenesis of lung cancer by interacting with STK38.

Abstract: Summary
Retrotransposons are a type of transposable element (TE) that have amplified to astonishing numbers in mammalian genomes, comprising more than a third of the human and mouse genomes. Long interspersed element class 1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposons are abundant and currently active retroelements in the human and mouse genomes. Similarly, long terminal repeat (LTR)-containing retrotransposons are abundant in both genomes, although only active in mice. LTR- and LINE-1-retroelements use different mechanisms for retrotransposition, although both involve the reverse transcription of an intermediate retroelement-derived RNA. Retrotransposon activity continues to effect the germline and somatic genomes, generating interindividual variability over evolution and potentially influencing cancer and brain physiology, respectively. However, relatively little is known about the functional consequences of retrotransposition. In this study, we have synthesized and characterized reverse transcriptase inhibitors specific for mammalian LINE-1 retrotransposons, which might help deciphering the functional impact of retrotransposition in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Glycoside phosphorylases (GPs) catalyze the reversible phosphorolysis of glycosidic bonds, releasing sugar 1-phosphates. To identify a greater range of these under-appreciated enzymes, we have developed a high-throughput functional screening method based on molybdenum blue formation. In a proof-of-principle screen focused on cellulose-degrading GPs we interrogated ∼23,000 large insert (fosmid) clones sourced from microbial communities inhabiting two separate environments and identified seven novel GPs from carbohydrate active enzyme family GH94 and one from GH149. Characterization identified cellobiose phosphorylases, cellodextrin phosphorylases, laminaribiose phosphorylases, and a β-1,3-glucan phosphorylase. To demonstrate the versatility of the screening method, varying substrate combinations were used to identify GP activity from families GH13, GH65, GH112, and GH130 in addition to GH94 and GH149. These pilot screen and substrate versatility results provide a screening paradigm platform for recovering diverse GPs from uncultivated microbial communities acting on different substrates with considerable potential to unravel previously unknown degradative pathways within microbiomes.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations in the gene encoding the type II transmembrane protease 3 (TMPRSS3) cause human hearing loss, although the underlying mechanisms that result in TMPRSS3-related hearing loss are still unclear. We combined the use of stem cell-derived inner ear organoids with single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the role of TMPRSS3. Defective Tmprss3 leads to hair cell apoptosis without altering the development of hair cells and the formation of the mechanotransduction apparatus. Prior to degeneration, Tmprss3-KO hair cells demonstrate reduced numbers of BK channels and lower expressions of genes encoding calcium ion-binding proteins, suggesting a disruption in intracellular homeostasis. A proteolytically active TMPRSS3 was detected on cell membranes in addition to ER of cells in inner ear organoids. Our in vitro model recapitulated salient features of genetically associated inner ear abnormalities and will serve as a powerful tool for studying inner ear disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The folate biosynthetic pathway offers many druggable targets that have yet to be exploited in tuberculosis therapy. Herein, we have identified a series of small molecules that interrupt Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) folate metabolism by dual targeting of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a key enzyme in the folate pathway, and its functional analog, Rv2671. We have also compared the antifolate activity of these compounds with that of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS). We found that the bioactive metabolite of PAS, in addition to previously reported activity against DHFR, inhibits flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase in Mtb, suggesting a multi-targeted mechanism of action for this drug. Finally, we have shown that antifolate treatment in Mtb decreases the production of mycolic acids, most likely due to perturbation of the activated methyl cycle. We conclude that multi-targeting of the folate pathway in Mtb is associated with highly potent anti-mycobacterial activity.

Abstract: Summary
CpG islands (CGIs) including those at imprinting control regions (ICRs) are protected from de novo methylation in somatic cells. However, many cancers often exhibit CGI hypermethylation, implying that the machinery is impaired in cancer cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of CGI methylation during somatic cell reprogramming. Although most CGIs remain hypomethylated, a small subset of CGIs, particularly at several ICRs, was often de novo methylated in reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Such de novo ICR methylation was linked with the silencing of reprogramming factors, which occurs at a late stage of reprogramming. The ICR-preferred CGI hypermethylation was similarly observed in human PSCs. Mechanistically, ablation of Dnmt3a prevented PSCs from de novo ICR methylation. Notably, the ICR-preferred CGI hypermethylation was observed in pediatric cancers, while adult cancers exhibit genome-wide CGI hypermethylation. These results may have important implications in the pathogenesis of pediatric cancers and the application of PSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic programs and host defense are highly integrated to ensure proper immune responses during stress. Central to these responses, mTOR regulates immune functions by sensing and integrating environmental cues, yet how these systems are coordinated at the intestinal surface remains undefined. We show that the antimicrobial peptide α-defensin is functionally sustained during nutrient deprivation because of regulation of the defensin-processing enzyme MMP7 by microbiota- and host-derived factors. Unlike other antimicrobial peptides, the MMP7-α-defensin axis remains active during nutrient fluctuations, providing essential protection against enteric pathogens. Sustained Mmp7 expression requires the microbiota and is mediated by de-repression of the transcription activator Atoh1 upon attenuation of the transcriptional repressor Hes1 in intestinal epithelial cells. Hes1 levels are regulated via mTOR and controlled translationally, constituting a metabolism-translation-transcription loop. Disrupting this loop by supplying nutrients paradoxically compromises antibacterial defense. Together, these results uncover a regulatory circuit that couples host nutrient status to epithelial antimicrobial immunity.

Abstract: Summary
A renewable source of human monocytes and macrophages would be a valuable alternative to primary cells from peripheral blood (PB) in biomedical research. We developed an efficient protocol to derive monocytes and macrophages from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and performed a functional comparison with PB-derived cells. hiPSC-derived monocytes were functional after cryopreservation and exhibited gene expression profiles comparable with PB-derived monocytes. Notably, hiPSC-derived monocytes were more activated with greater adhesion to endothelial cells under physiological flow. hiPSC-derived monocytes were successfully polarized to M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes, which showed similar pan- and subtype-specific gene and surface protein expression and cytokine secretion to PB-derived macrophages. hiPSC-derived macrophages exhibited higher endocytosis and efferocytosis and similar bacterial and tumor cell phagocytosis to PB-derived macrophages. In summary, we developed a robust protocol to generate hiPSC monocytes and macrophages from independent hiPSC lines that showed aspects of functional maturity comparable with those from PB.

Abstract: The skeletal system is a dynamic organ that continuously undergoes coupled trabeculae and blood vessels remodeling, indicating the possible existence of molecular crosstalk between endothelial and osteoblastic cells. Since the cross-talk between bone-forming osteoblasts (OBs) and vessel-forming endothelial cells (ECs) have progressively gained investigators’ attention, few studies focused on the regulatory function of extracellular vesicles derived from OBs on ECs. In this study, the effect of the exosomes derived from mature osteoblasts (MOBs) on the ECs was investigated. Firstly, exosomes derived from mature osteoblasts (MOB-Exos) were isolated and identified by NanoSight light scatter technology, electron microscopy and Western bolting. Fluorescent labeling of MOB-Exos revealed its internalization by ECs. RNA interference technique was used to knock down matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) in MOB-Exos. Then ECs were co-cultured with MOB-Exos and MMP2 knockdown MOB-Exos. Wound healing migration assay, transwell migration assay, CCK-8 assay and tube formation assay of ECs were conducted to determine the angiogenic capability of ECs. Then the VEGF/Erk1/2 pathway markers were detected by Western blot. Our results showed that MOB-Exos could promote the proliferation, migration and tube formation of ECs. Meanwhile, the promoted angiogenetic capacities of ECs were impaired when MMP2 in MOB-Exos was knocked down. In addition, immunoblotting indicated that MOB-Exos could promote the activation of the VEGF/Erk1/2 pathway of ECs; whereas the activation of the VEGF/Erk1/2 pathway was attenuated when the ECs were co-cultured with the MMP2 knockdown MOB-Exos. In conclusion, the MMP-2 existing in exosomes derived from MOBs could promote the angiogenesis of ECs in vitro, which might be realized through VEGF/Erk1/2 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Induction of pluripotency in somatic cells with defined genetic factors has been successfully used to investigate the mechanisms of disease initiation and progression. Cellular reprogramming and oncogenic transformation share common features; both involve undergoing a dramatic change in cell identity, and immortalization is a key step for cancer progression that enhances reprogramming. However, there are very few examples of complete successful reprogramming of tumor cells. Here we address the effect of expressing an active oncogene, RAS, on the process of reprogramming and found that, while combined expression with reprogramming factors enhanced dedifferentiation, expression within the context of neoplastic transformation impaired reprogramming. RAS induces expression changes that promote loss of cell identity and acquisition of stemness in a paracrine manner and these changes result in reprogramming when combined with reprogramming factors. When cells carry cooperating oncogenic defects, RAS drives cells into an incompatible cellular fate of malignancy.

Abstract: Increasing evidence indicates that in response to environmental changes, macrophages can dynamically change into two main functional phenotypes, namely M1 and M2. Depending on these different phenotypes, macrophages can produce either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory factors which may affect the outcome of inflammation. Mastering the switching of M1/M2 phenotypes may provide therapeutic approaches to chronic inflammatory disease, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, even the metabolic disorders. Cathepsin C (CTSC), as a member of the papain family of cysteine proteases, is a key enzyme in the activation of granule serine proteases thereby involved in modulating the inflammatory responses. Moreover, abundant expression of CTSC has been found in M1 macrophages in plaques of atherosclerosis and related to the progression of disease. However, whether CTSC can regulate macrophage activation status in inflammatory responses has not been fully investigated. In the present study, using peritoneal macrophages (PMs) and mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 treated with LPS and active monomer of CTSC, we found that CTSC was not only expressed in macrophages in M1 activation status, but also facilitated macrophages towards M1 phenotype, suggesting a self-activation mechanism involved in this process which may lead to a vicious circle in chronic inflammation. Then we attempted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of CTSC resulting in M1 activation. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is one of the non-receptor cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, serving as an upstream mediator that leads to transcription of many pro-inflammatory factors. We found FAK expression was up-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels following CTSC stimulation, and FAK phosphorylation level was also significantly increased. The p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway, as the downstream of FAK, were also found activated in CTSC-treated macrophages, suggesting that CTSC may promote macrophage towards M1 activation status through FAK-induced p38MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway activation. Our study provides a new therapeutic target in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Background
Angiostrongylus cantonensis (A. cantonensis) is a foodborne parasite that can invade the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in eosinophilic meningitis (EM). However, the mechanism by which A. cantonensis causes eosinophilic infiltration into CNS is not well understood.
Methods
In this study eosinophilic infiltration into the CNS caused by A. cantonensis was assessed based on eosinophil counts and evaluation of interleukin (IL)-5 and −13 levels by real-time PCR in brain of Balb/c mice. The expression and activation of IL-17A, IL17 receptor (IL-17R A), and IL-17RC and the related signaling molecules nuclear factor (NF)-κB1, NF-κB2, NF-κB activator (Act)1, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (Traf)5, and Traf6 during A. cantonensis infection in brain tissue of Balb/c mice were examined by real-time, western blotting and immunofluroence. A. cantonensis-infected Balb/c mice were treated with IL-17A neutralizing antibody to evaluate the role of IL17A in eosinophil accumulation in the CNS.
Results
Our results showed A. cantonensis infection caused eosinophil accumulation and alterations in IL-5 and -13 levels. The expression of IL-17A and −17RA, Act1, and Traf6 but not of IL-17RC and Traf5 was upregulated during infection; this was accompanied by NF-κB1 and -κB2 activation. Importantly, application of IL-17A neutralizing antibody attenuated eosinophil accumulation in CNS and reversed the changes in IL-5 and -13 expression caused by A. cantonensis infection. Additionally, IL-17RA and Traf6 levels decreased, which was accompanied by NF-κB inactivation.
Conclusion
IL-17A plays an important role in EM caused by A. cantonensis, possibly through activation of NF-κB via the IL-17RA/Traf6 signaling pathway. These findings highlight the potential for using IL-17A neutralizing antibody as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of EM.

Abstract: Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) regulates both cell cycle and transcription, but its precise role remains elusive. We previously described THZ1, a CDK7 inhibitor, which dramatically inhibits superenhancer-associated gene expression. However, potent CDK12/13 off-target activity obscured CDK7s contribution to this phenotype. Here, we describe the discovery of a highly selective covalent CDK7 inhibitor. YKL-5-124 causes arrest at the G1/S transition and inhibition of E2F-driven gene expression; these effects are rescued by a CDK7 mutant unable to covalently engage YKL-5-124, demonstrating on-target specificity. Unlike THZ1, treatment with YKL-5-124 resulted in no change to RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphorylation; however, inhibition could be reconstituted by combining YKL-5-124 and THZ531, a selective CDK12/13 inhibitor, revealing potential redundancies in CDK control of gene transcription. These findings highlight the importance of CDK7/12/13 polypharmacology for anti-cancer activity of THZ1 and posit that selective inhibition of CDK7 may be useful for treatment of cancers marked by E2F misregulation.

Abstract: Summary
Diadenosine polyphosphates (ApnAs) such as diadenosine tri- and tetraphosphates are formed in prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic cells. Since upon stress intracellular ApnA concentrations increase, it was postulated that ApnAs are alarmones triggering stress-adaptive processes. The major synthesis pathway of ApnAs is assumed to be a side reaction of amino acid activation. How this process is linked to stress adaptation remains enigmatic. The first step of one of the most prominent eukaryotic post-translational modification systems—the conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) to target proteins—involves the formation of an adenylate as intermediate. Like ApnA formation, Ub and Ubl conjugation is significantly enhanced during stress conditions. Here, we demonstrate that diadenosine tri- and tetraphosphates are indeed synthesized during activation of Ub and Ubls. This links one of the most prevalent eukaryotic protein-modification systems to ApnA formation for the first time.

Abstract: The heat-inducible expression system has been widely used to produce recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. However, the rise in temperature affects cell growth, activates the bacterial Heat-Shock Response (HSR), and promotes the formation of insoluble protein aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs). In this work, we evaluate the effect of the culture scale (shake flasks and bioreactors) and induction temperature (39 and 42 °C) on the kinetic behavior of thermoinducible recombinant E. coli ATCC 53606 producing rESAT-6 (6-kDa early-secretory antigenic target from Mycobacterium tuberculosis), compared with cultures grown at 30°C (without induction). Also, the expression of the major E. coli chaperones (DnaK and GroEL) was analyzed. We found that almost twice maximum biomass and rESAT-6 production were obtained in bioreactors (~ 3.29 g/L of biomass and ~ 0.27 g/L of rESAT-6) than in shake flasks (~ 1.41 g/L of biomass and ~ 0.14 g/L of rESAT-6) when induction was carried out at 42 °C, but similar amounts of rESAT-6 were obtained from cultures induced at 39°C (~ 0.14 g/L). In all thermo-induced conditions, rESAT-6 was trapped in IBs. Furthermore, DnaK was preferably expressed in the soluble fraction, while GroEL was present in IBs. Importantly, IBs formed at 39 °C, in both shake flasks and bioreactors, were more susceptible to degradation by proteinase-K, indicating a lower amyloid content compared to IBs formed at 42 °C. Our work presents evidence that the culture scale and the induction temperature modify the E. coli metabolic response, expression of chaperones, and structure of the IBs during rESAT-6 protein production in a thermoinducible system.

Abstract: Summary
Increased telomerase activity is associated with malignancy and poor prognosis in human cancer, but the development of targeted agents has not yet provided clinical benefit. Here we report that, instead of targeting the telomerase enzyme directly, small molecules that bind to the G-hairpin of the hTERT G-quadruplex-forming sequence kill selectively malignant cells without altering the function of normal cells. RG260 targets the hTERT G-quadruplex stem-loop folding but not tetrad DNAs, leading to downregulation of hTERT expression. To improve physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, we derived a small-molecule analog, RG1603, from the parent compound. RG1603 induces mitochondrial defects including PGC1α and NRF2 inhibition and increases oxidative stress, followed by DNA damage and apoptosis. RG1603 injected as a single agent has tolerable toxicity while achieving strong anticancer efficacy in a tumor xenograft mouse model. These results demonstrate a unique approach to inhibiting the hTERT that functions by impairing mitochondrial activity, inducing cell death.

Abstract: Summary
Natural selection shapes bacterial evolution in all environments. However, the extent to which commensal bacteria diversify and adapt within the human gut remains unclear. Here, we combine culture-based population genomics and metagenomics to investigate the within-microbiome evolution of Bacteroides fragilis. We find that intra-individual B. fragilis populations contain substantial de novo nucleotide and mobile element diversity, preserving years of within-person history. This history reveals multiple signatures of within-person adaptation, including parallel evolution in sixteen genes. Many of these genes are implicated in cell-envelope biosynthesis and polysaccharide utilization. Tracking evolutionary trajectories using near-daily metagenomic sampling, we find evidence for years-long coexistence in one subject despite adaptive dynamics. We used public metagenomes to investigate one adaptive mutation common in our cohort and found that it emerges frequently in Western, but not Chinese, microbiomes. Collectively, these results demonstrate that B. fragilis adapts within individual microbiomes, pointing to factors that promote long-term gut colonization.

Abstract: Summary
We describe a multistep method for endogenous tagging of transcriptionally silent genes in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). A monomeric EGFP (mEGFP) fusion tag and a constitutively expressed mCherry fluorescence selection cassette were delivered in tandem via homology-directed repair to five genes not expressed in hiPSCs but important for cardiomyocyte sarcomere function: TTN, MYL7, MYL2, TNNI1, and ACTN2. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to deliver the selection cassette and subsequently mediate its excision via microhomology-mediated end-joining and non-homologous end-joining. Most excised clones were effectively tagged, and all properly tagged clones expressed the mEGFP fusion protein upon differentiation into cardiomyocytes, allowing live visualization of these cardiac proteins at the sarcomere. This methodology provides a broadly applicable strategy for endogenously tagging transcriptionally silent genes in hiPSCs, potentially enabling their systematic and dynamic study during differentiation and morphogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
“Antioxidant activity” is an often invoked, but generally poorly characterized, molecular property. Several assays are available to determine antioxidant activity, the most popular of which is based upon the ability of a putative antioxidant to reduce 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. Here, we show that the results of this assay do not correlate with the potency of putative antioxidants as inhibitors of ferroptosis, the oxidative cell death modality associated with (phospho)lipid peroxidation. We subsequently describe our efforts to develop an approach that quantifies the reactivity of putative antioxidants with the (phospho)lipid peroxyl radicals that propagate (phospho)lipid peroxidation (dubbed FENIX [fluorescence-enabled inhibited autoxidation]). The results obtained with FENIX afford an excellent correlation with anti-ferroptotic potency, which facilitates mechanistic characterization of ferroptosis inhibitors, and reveals the importance of H-bonding interactions between antioxidant and phospholipid that underlie both the lackluster antioxidant activity of phenols under physiologically relevant conditions and the emergence of arylamines as inhibitors of choice.
