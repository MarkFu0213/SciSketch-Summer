Abstract: Recent work reveals that actin acetylation modification has been linked to different normal and disease processes and the effects associated with metabolic and environmental stressors. Herein, we highlight the effects of calreticulin on actin acetylation and cell injury induced by microwave radiation in human microvascular endothelial cell (HMEC). HMEC injury was induced by high-power microwave of different power density (10, 30, 60, 100 mW/cm2, for 6 min) with or without exogenous recombinant calreticulin. The cell injury was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and Cell Counting Kit-8 in culture medium, migration ability, intercellular junction, and cytoskeleton staining in HMEC. Western blotting analysis was used to detected calreticulin expression in cytosol and nucleus and acetylation of globular actin (G-actin). We found that HMEC injury was induced by microwave radiation in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment HMEC with calreticulin suppressed microwave radiation-induced LDH leakage and increased cell viability and improved microwave radiation-induced decrease in migration, intercellular junction, and cytoskeleton. Meanwhile, pretreatment HMEC with exogenous calreticulin upregulated the histone acetyltransferase activity and the acetylation level of G-actin and increased the fibrous actin (F-actin)/G-actin ratio. We conclude that exogenous calreticulin protects HMEC against microwave radiation-induced injury through promoting actin acetylation and polymerization.

Abstract: Cell lines established from tumors are the most commonly used models in cancer research, and their use in recent years has enabled a greater understanding of the biology of cancer and the means to develop effective treatment strategies. Astroblastomas are uncommon neuroepithelial tumors of glial origin, predominantly affecting young people, mainly teenagers and children, predominantly females. To date, only a single study has reported that astroblastomas contain a large number of neural stem-like cells, which had only a partial proliferation capacity and differentiation. Our objective was to establish an astroblastoma cell line to investigate the presence of astroblastic cells and cancer stem-like cells. The migratory and invasion abilities of the cells were quantified with invasion and migration assays and compared to a glioblastoma cell line. The presence of stem cells was detected with surface-marker analysis by using flow cytometry, and measuring the differentiation ability with a differentiation assay and the self-renewal capacity with a sphere-forming assay. These characteristics may determine whether this novel cell line is a model for astroblastomas that may have stem-cell characteristics. With this novel cell line, scientists can investigate the molecular pathways underlying astroblastomas and develop new therapeutic strategies for patients with these tumors.

Abstract: Summary
We hypothesized that the neonatal rat heart would bring transplanted human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to maturity as it grows to adult size. In neonatal rat heart, engrafted hiPSC derivatives developed partially matured myofibrils after 3 months, with increasing cell size and sarcomere length. There was no difference between grafts from hiPSC-CMs or hiPSC-derived cardiac progenitors (hiPSC-CPs) at 3 months, nor was maturation influenced by infarction. Interestingly, the infarcted adult heart induced greater human cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and induction of cardiac troponin I expression than the neonatal heart. Although human cardiomyocytes at all time points were significantly smaller than the host rat cardiomyocytes, transplanted neonatal rat cardiomyocytes reached adult size and structure by 3 months. Thus, the adult rat heart induces faster maturation than the neonatal heart, and human cardiomyocytes mature more slowly than rat cardiomyocytes. The slower maturation of human cardiomyocytes could be related to environmental mismatch or cell-autonomous factors.

Abstract: Summary
Solving the antibiotic resistance crisis requires the discovery of new antimicrobial drugs and the preservation of existing ones. The discovery of inhibitors of antibiotic resistance, antibiotic adjuvants, is a proven example of the latter. A major difficulty in identifying new antibiotics is the frequent rediscovery of known compounds, necessitating laborious “dereplication” to identify novel chemical entities. We have developed an antibiotic resistance platform (ARP) that can be used for both the identification of antibiotic adjuvants and for antibiotic dereplication. The ARP is a cell-based array of mechanistically distinct individual resistance elements in an identical genetic background. In dereplication mode, we demonstrate the rapid identification, and thus discrimination, of common antibiotics. In adjuvant discovery mode, we show that the ARP can be harnessed in screens to identify inhibitors of resistance. The ARP is therefore a powerful tool that has broad application in confronting the resistance crisis.

Abstract: The lymphatic system is lined by endothelial cells and part of the vasculature. It is essential for tissue fluid homeostasis, absorption of dietary fats, and immune surveillance in vertebrates. Misregulation of lymphatic vessel formation and dysfunction of the lymphatic system have been indicated in a number of pathological conditions including lymphedema formation, obesity or chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In zebrafish, lymphatics were discovered about 10years ago, and the underlying molecular pathways involved in its development have since been studied in detail. Due to its superior live cell imaging possibilities and the broad tool kit for forward and reverse genetics, the zebrafish has become an important model organism to study the development of the lymphatic system during early embryonic development. In the current review, we will focus on the key players during zebrafish lymphangiogenesis and compare the roles of these genes to their mammalian counterparts. In particular, we will focus on novel findings that shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of lymphatic cell fate specification, as well as sprouting and migration of lymphatic precursor cells.

Abstract: Th17 cells are involved in liver fibrosis by activating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). We aimed to investigate whether HSCs are able to regulate the function of Th17 cells and to determine the relevant mechanism. Sixty-five patients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) were enrolled in this study. To determine the effect of HSCs on T cells, naïve CD4+T cells and Th17 cells were sorted from CHB patients and cultured with or without activated-HSCs, and cytokine expression and gene transcription were analyzed. In addition, the regulatory mechanism of HSCs was investigated. ELISA and qRT-PCR showed that Th17 cells from CHB patients were more pathogenic, on the basis of the expression of IL-17A, IL-23R, RORC, CCL20 and CCR6, and meanwhile, they could activate the primary HSCs. Co-culture experiments indicated that activated HSCs dramatically promoted proliferation of CD4+T cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, they could induce naïve CD4+T cells to become Th17 cells which had a more pathogenic phenotype. Moreover, activated HSCs-mediated induction of Th17 cells might depend on the release of IL-1β and IL-6 as well as on the COX-PGE2 pathway. Th17 cells cooperated with HSCs in a proinflammatory feedback loop might provide a better understanding of the pathogenic role of Th17 cells in the chronicity of HBV infection.

Abstract: The human endometrium is a highly dynamic tissue with the ability to cyclically regenerate during the reproductive life. Endometrial mesenchymal stem-like cells (eMSCs) located throughout the endometrium have shown to functionally contribute to endometrial regeneration. In this study we examine whether the menstrual cycle stage and the location in the endometrial bilayer (superficial and deep portions of the endometrium) has an effect on stem cell activities of eMSCs (CD140b+CD146+ cells). Here we show the percentage and clonogenic ability of eMSCs were constant in the various stages of the menstrual cycle (menstrual, proliferative and secretory). However, eMSCs from the menstrual endometrium underwent significantly more rounds of self-renewal and enabled a greater total cell output than those from the secretory phase. Significantly more eMSCs were detected in the deeper portion of the endometrium compared to the superficial layer but their clonogenic and self-renewal activities remained similar. Our findings suggest that eMSCs are activated in the menstrual phase for the cyclical regeneration of the endometrium.

Abstract: Stem and progenitor cells that exhibit significant regenerative potential and critical roles in cancer initiation and progression remain difficult to characterize. Cell fates are determined by reciprocal signaling between the cell microenvironment and the nucleus; hence parameters derived from nuclear remodeling are ideal candidates for stem/progenitor cell characterization. Here we applied high-content, single cell analysis of nuclear shape and organization to examine stem and progenitor cells destined to distinct differentiation endpoints, yet undistinguishable by conventional methods. Nuclear descriptors defined through image informatics classified mesenchymal stem cells poised to either adipogenic or osteogenic differentiation, and oligodendrocyte precursors isolated from different regions of the brain and destined to distinct astrocyte subtypes. Nuclear descriptors also revealed early changes in stem cells after chemical oncogenesis, allowing the identification of a class of cancer-mitigating biomaterials. To capture the metrology of nuclear changes, we developed a simple and quantitative “imaging-derived” parsing index, which reflects the dynamic evolution of the high-dimensional space of nuclear organizational features. A comparative analysis of parsing outcomes via either nuclear shape or textural metrics of the nuclear structural protein NuMA indicates the nuclear shape alone is a weak phenotypic predictor. In contrast, variations in the NuMA organization parsed emergent cell phenotypes and discerned emergent stages of stem cell transformation, supporting a prognosticating role for this protein in the outcomes of nuclear functions.

Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is becoming increasingly used in the biology field. It can give highly accurate topography and biomechanical quantitative data, such as adhesion, elasticity, and viscosity, on living samples. Nowadays, correlative light electron microscopy is a must-have tool in the biology field that combines different microscopy techniques to spatially and temporally analyze the structure and function of a single sample. Here, we describe the combination of AFM with superresolution light microscopy and electron microscopy. We named this technique correlative light atomic force electron microscopy (CLAFEM) in which AFM can be used on fixed and living cells in association with superresolution light microscopy and further processed for transmission or scanning electron microscopy. We herein illustrate this approach to observe cellular bacterial infection and cytoskeleton. We show that CLAFEM brings complementary information at the cellular level, from on the one hand protein distribution and topography at the nanometer scale and on the other hand elasticity at the piconewton scales to fine ultrastructural details.

Moderate endoplasmic reticulum stress activates a PERK and p38-dependent apoptosis,

Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has the ability to signal organelle dysfunction via a complex signaling network known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). In this work, hamster fibroblast cells exhibiting moderate levels of ER stress were compared to those exhibiting severe ER stress. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation was accomplished via a temperature-sensitive mutation in the Dad1 subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex or by direct inhibition with tunicamycin (Tm). Temperature shift (TS) treatment generated weak activation of ER stress signaling when compared to doses of Tm that are typically used in ER stress studies (500–1000 nM). A dose-response analysis of key ER stress signaling mediators, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), revealed 20–40 nM of Tm to generate activation intensity similar to TS treatment. In parental BHK21 cells, moderate (20–40 nM) and high doses (200–1000 nM) of Tm were compared to identify physiological and signaling-based differences in stress response. Inhibition of ER Ca2+ release via ITPR activity with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) or Xestospongin C (XeC) was sufficient to protect against apoptosis induced by moderate but not higher doses of Tm. Analysis of kinase activation over a range of Tm exposures revealed the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) to display increasing activation with Tm dosage. Interestingly, Tm induced the extracellular regulated kinases (Erk1/2) only at moderate doses of Tm. Inhibition of ER transmembrane stress sensors (IRE1, PERK) or cytosolic signaling mediators (p38, Jnk1, Erk1/2) was used to evaluate pathways involved in apoptosis activation during ER stress. Inhibition of either PERK or p38 was sufficient to reduce cell death and apoptosis induced by moderate, but not high, doses of Tm. During ER stress, cells exhibited a rapid decline in anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and survivin proteins. Inhibition of PERK was sufficient to block this affect. This work reveals moderate doses of ER stress to generate patterns of stress signaling that are distinct from higher doses and that apoptosis activation at moderate levels of stress are dependent upon PERK and p38 signaling. Studies exploring ER stress signaling should recognize that this signaling acts as a rheostat rather than a simple switch, behaving distinctively in a dose-dependent manner.

Mesenchymal to Epithelial Transition Mediated by CDH1 Promotes Spontaneous Reprogramming of Male Germline Stem Cells to Pluripotency,

Abstract: Summary
Cultured spermatogonial stem cells (GSCs) can spontaneously form pluripotent cells in certain culture conditions. However, GSC reprogramming is a rare event that is largely unexplained. We show GSCs have high expression of mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) suppressors resulting in a developmental barrier inhibiting GSC reprogramming. Either increasing OCT4 or repressing transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling promotes GSC reprogramming by upregulating CDH1 and boosting MET. Reducing ZEB1 also enhances GSC reprogramming through its direct effect on CDH1. RNA sequencing shows that rare GSCs, identified as CDH1+ after trypsin digestion, are epithelial-like cells. CDH1+ GSCs exhibit enhanced reprogramming and become more prevalent during the course of reprogramming. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the spontaneous emergence of pluripotent cells from GSC cultures; namely, rare GSCs upregulate CDH1 and initiate MET, processes normally kept in check by ZEB1 and TGF-β signaling, thereby ensuring germ cells are protected from aberrant acquisition of pluripotency.

Abstract: Background
To investigate the effects of CD8+ memory T (Tm) cells and CD8+ effector memory T (Tem) cells on the results of allogeneic heart retransplantations performed in mice.
Methods
A skin transplantation model was used to generate sensitized splenic CD8+ Tem cells for infusion into BALB/c mice. One week after infusion, the BALB/c mice underwent allogeneic heart transplantation in the abdominal cavity. Cyclosporin A was administered via intraperitoneal injection starting one day prior to transplantation to arrest immunological rejection of the transplanted heart. The effects of sensitized CD8+ Tem cells on allogeneic heart graft rejection were examined by monitoring survival of the transplanted hearts, the infiltration of effector memory CD8+ T cells into myocardium, and expressions of inflammatory cytokines in blood serum.
Results
Adoptive transfer of sensitized CD8+ Tem cells prior to transplantation induced an acute rejection response which decreased the survival of transplanted hearts. The rejection response was accompanied by an infiltration of CD8+ Tem cells into the transplanted myocardial tissue. Additionally, infusion of sensitized CD8+ Tem cells induced markedly increased expressions of IL-2 and IFN-γ, and decreased expression of TGF-β in the transplanted hearts, as well as higher levels of IFN-γ and CXCL-9 in blood serum.
Conclusions
The infusion of sensitized CD8+ Tem cells induced an acute graft rejection response and decreased the survival of grafted hearts by regulating the expressions of inflammatory cytokines including CXCL-9, IL-2, and INF-γ. Cyclosporin A had no therapeutic effect on the graft rejection response induced by sensitized CD8+ Tem cells.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolism of oxidative stress is necessary for cellular survival. We have previously utilized the zebrafish as a model of the oxidative stress response. In this study, we found that gata1-expressing erythroid cells contributed to a significant proportion of total-body oxidative stress when animals were exposed to a strong pro-oxidant. RNA-seq of zebrafish under oxidative stress revealed the induction of tp53. Zebrafish carrying tp53 with a mutation in its DNA-binding domain were acutely sensitive to pro-oxidant exposure and displayed significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tp53-independent erythroid cell death resulting in an edematous phenotype. We found that a major contributing factor to ROS was increased basal mitochondrial respiratory rate without reserve. These data add to the concept that tp53, while classically a tumor suppressor and cell-cycle regulator, has additional roles in controlling cellular oxidative stress.

Abstract: Lethal and incurable bone metastasis is one of the main causes of death in multiple types of cancer. A small subpopulation of cancer stem/progenitor-like cells (CSCs), also known as tumor-initiating cells from heterogenetic cancer is considered to mediate bone metastasis. Although over the past decades numerous studies have been performed in different types of cancer, it is still difficult to track small numbers of CSCs during the onset of metastasis. With use of noninvasive high-resolution imaging, transparent zebrafish embryos can be employed to dynamically visualize cancer progression and reciprocal interaction with stroma in a living organism. Recently we established a zebrafish CSC-xenograft model to visually and functionally analyze the role of CSCs and their interactions with the microenvironment at the onset of metastasis. Given the highly conserved human and zebrafish genome, transplanted human cancer cells are able to respond to zebrafish cytokines, modulate the zebrafish microenvironment, and take advantage of the zebrafish stroma during cancer progression. This chapter delineates the zebrafish CSC-xenograft model as a useful tool for both CSC biological study and anticancer drug screening.

Abstract: Background
The db/db mouse is an animal model of diabetes in which leptin receptor activity is deficient resulting accelerated cardiomyopathy when exposed to angiotensin (AT). Toll-like receptors 4 and 2 (TLR4, TLR2) are pattern recognition receptors, that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and exacerbate and release inflammatory cytokines. Fetuin A (Fet A) is a fatty acid carrier which affects inflammation and insulin resistance in obese humans and animals through TLRs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of caloric restriction (CR) on free fatty acids (FFA) level and the inflammatory response in diabetic cardiomyopathy.
Methods and results
Left ventricular hypertrophy, increased fibrosis and leukocytes infiltration were observed in db/db AT treated hearts. Serum glucose, FFA, and cholesterol levels were elevated in db/db AT treated mice. Cardiac expression of PPARα increased while AKT phosphorylation was decreased.
Conclusions
Cumulatively, CR elevated cardiac PPARα improved the utilization of fatty acids, and reduced myocardial inflammation as seen by reduced levels of Fet A. Thus CR negated cardiomyopathy associated with AT in an animal model of diabetes suggesting that CR is an effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of diabetes and associated cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: CEACAM1 transfection into breast cancer cells restores lumen formation in a 3D culture model. Among the top up-regulated genes that were associated with restoration of lumen formation, the adaptor protein SASH1 was identified. Furthermore, SASH1 was shown to be critical for lumen formation by RNAi inhibition. Upon analyzing the gene array from CEACAM1/MCF7 cells treated with SASH1 RNAi, DLK1, an inhibitor of NOTCH1 signaling, was found to be down-regulated to the same extent as SASH1. Subsequent treatment of CEACAM1/MCF7 cells with RNAi to DLK1 also inhibited lumen formation, supporting its association with SASH1. In agreement with the role of DLK1 as a NOTCH1 inhibitor, NOTCH1, as well as its regulated genes HES1 and HEY1, were down-regulated in CEACAM1/MCF7 cells by the action of DLK1 RNAi, and up-regulated by SASH1 RNAi. When CEACAM1/MCF7 cells were treated with a γ-secretase inhibitor known to inhibit NOTCH signaling, lumen formation was inhibited. We conclude that restoration of lumen formation by CEACAM1 regulates the NOTCH1 signaling pathway via the adaptor protein SASH1 and the NOTCH1 inhibitor DLK1. These data suggest that the putative involvement of NOTCH1 as a tumor-promoting gene in breast cancer may depend on its lack of regulation in cancer, whereas its involvement in normal lumen formation requires activation of its expression, and subsequently, inhibition of its signaling.

Abstract: The mitotic spindle is a highly organized and dynamic structure required for segregation of the genetic material into two daughter cells. Although most of the individual players involved in building the spindle have been characterized in vitro, a general understanding of how all of the spindle players act together in vivo is still missing. Hence, in recent years, experiments have focused on introducing mechanical perturbations of the spindle on a micron scale, thereby providing insight into its function and organization, as well as into forces acting in the spindle. Among different types of mechanical perturbations, optical ones are more flexible, less invasive, and more precise than other approaches. In this chapter, we describe a detailed protocol for cutting the microtubule bundles in human cells using a near-infrared femtosecond laser. This type of laser microsurgery provides the ability to precisely sever a single microtubule bundle while preserving spindle integrity and dynamics. Furthermore, we describe quantitative measurements obtained from the response of a severed microtubule bundle to laser ablation, which reveal the structure and function of individual parts of the spindle, such as the bridging fiber connecting sister k-fibers. Finally, the method described here can be easily combined with other quantitative techniques to address the complexity of the spindle.

Abstract: Diabetic nephropathy is a common kidney condition in patients with diabetes mellitus, which can result in renal failure. Pyroptosis, the process of pro-inflammatory programmed cell death, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Long non-coding RNA MALAT1 has also been shown to be involved in diabetic nephropathy. Here, we investigated the role of MALAT1 and the microRNA miR-23c and its target gene ELAVL1 in renal tubular epithelial cells. Our data demonstrated that MALAT1 expression was substantially increased but miR-23c was decreased in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in high-glucose-treated HK-2 cells. Downregulation of MALAT1 or upregulation the expression of miR-23c inhibited pyroptosis in HK-2 cells. In an effort to understand the signaling mechanisms underlying the pro-pyroptotic properties of MALAT1 and the anti-pyroptotic properties of miR-23c, we found that inhibiting the expression of MALAT1 downregulated the expression of ELAVL1, NLRP3, Caspase-1 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. These findings were replicated by upregulation of miR-23c. Moreover, luciferase assays showed that miR-23c, as a target of MALAT1, directly repressed ELAVL1 expression and then decreased the expression of its downstream protein NLRP3. The expression of MALAT1 antagonized the effect of miR-23c on the downregulation of its target ELAVL1 and inhibited hyperglycemia-induced cell pyroptosis. This mechanism may contribute to a better understanding of diabetic nephropathy pathogenesis and facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this disease.

Abstract: Exploring the cell biology of hepatocytes in vitro could be a powerful strategy to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the structure and function of the liver in vivo. However, this approach relies on appropriate in vitro cell culture systems that can recapitulate the cell biological and metabolic features of the hepatocytes in the liver whilst being accessible to experimental manipulations. Here, we adapted protocols for high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and quantitative image analysis to compare two primary hepatocyte culture systems, monolayer and collagen sandwich, with respect to the distribution of two distinct populations of early endosomes (APPL1 and EEA1-positive), endocytic capacity, metabolic and signaling activities. In addition to the re-acquisition of hepatocellular polarity, primary hepatocytes grown in collagen sandwich but not in monolayer culture recapitulated the apico-basal distribution of EEA1 endosomes observed in liver tissue. We found that such distribution correlated with the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in vitro and, surprisingly, was dependent on the nutritional state in vivo. Hepatocytes in collagen sandwich also exhibited faster kinetics of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) internalization, showed improved insulin sensitivity and preserved their ability for glucose production, compared to hepatocytes in monolayer cultures. Although no in vitro culture system can reproduce the exquisite structural features of liver tissue, our data nevertheless highlight the ability of the collagen sandwich system to recapitulate key structural and functional properties of the hepatocytes in the liver and, therefore, support the usage of this system to study aspects of hepatocellular biology in vitro.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the genes and pathways that respond to heat stress in Holstein bull calves exposed to severe ranges of temperature and humidity. A total of ten animals from 4 to 6 months of age were subjected to heat stress at 37°C and 90 % humidity for 12 h. Skin and rectal temperatures were measured before and after heat stress; while no correlation was found between them before heat stress, a moderate correlation was detected after heat stress, confirming rectal temperature to be a better barometer for monitoring heat stress. RNAseq analysis identified 8567 genes to be differentially regulated, out of which 465 genes were significantly upregulated (≥2-fold, P < 0.05) and 49 genes were significantly downregulated (≤2-fold, P < 0.05) in response to heat stress. Significant terms and pathways enriched in response to heat stress included chaperones, cochaperones, cellular response to heat stress, phosphorylation, kinase activation, immune response, apoptosis, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Pi3K/AKT activation, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, interferon signaling, pathways in cancer, estrogen signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. The differentially expressed genes were validated by quantitative real-time PCR analysis, which confirmed the tendency of the expression. The genes and pathways identified in this analysis extend our understanding of transcriptional response to heat stress and their likely functioning in adapting the animal to hyperthermic stress. The identified genes could be used as candidate genes for association studies to select and breed animals with improved heat tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes lethal disease in humans, which is characterized by exacerbated inflammatory response and extensive lung pathology. To address the relevance of small non-coding RNAs in SARS-CoV pathology, we deep sequenced RNAs from the lungs of infected mice and discovered three 18–22 nt small viral RNAs (svRNAs). The three svRNAs were derived from the nsp3 (svRNA-nsp3.1 and -nsp3.2) and N (svRNA-N) genomic regions of SARS-CoV. Biogenesis of CoV svRNAs was RNase III, cell type, and host species independent, but it was dependent on the extent of viral replication. Antagomir-mediated inhibition of svRNA-N significantly reduced in vivo lung pathology and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Taken together, these data indicate that svRNAs contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis and highlight the potential of svRNA-N antagomirs as antivirals.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive degenerative disease that affects motor neurons. Recent studies identified the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA4 as a disease-modifying gene that is critical for the progression of motor neuron degeneration. We report on the design and characterization of a family of EphA4 targeting agents that bind to its ligand binding domain with nanomolar affinity. The molecules exhibit excellent selectivity and display efficacy in a SOD1 mutant mouse model of ALS. Interestingly, the molecules appear to act as agonists for the receptor in certain surrogate cellular assays. While the exact mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effect of the new agonists remain to be elucidated, we believe that the described agent represents both an invaluable pharmacological tool to further decipher the role of the EphA4 in ALS and potentially other human diseases, and a significant stepping stone for the development of novel treatments.

Abstract: Summary
The Wnt signaling pathway plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation, thus it is often associated with diseases such as cancers. Unfortunately, although attractive, developing anti-cancer strategy targeting Wnt signaling has been challenging given that the most attractive targets are involved in protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Here, we develop a stapled peptide inhibitor that targets the interaction between β-catenin and T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor transcription factors, which are crucially involved in Wnt signaling. Our integrative approach combines peptide stapling to optimize proteolytic stability, with lessons learned from cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) design to maximize cellular uptake resulting in NLS-StAx-h, a selective, cell permeable, stapled peptide inhibitor of oncogenic Wnt signaling that efficiently inhibits β-catenin-transcription factor interactions. We expect that this type of integrative strategy that endows stapled peptides with CPP features will be generally useful for developing inhibitors of intracellular PPIs.

Abstract: We evaluated the feasibility of FTIR microspectroscopy combined with partial least squares regression (PLS-R) for determination of resistance in HepG2 cells. Cell viability testing was performed using neutral red assay for the concentration of cisplatin resulting in 50% antiproliferation (IC50). The resistance index (RI) is the ratio of the IC50 in resistant HepG2 cells vs. parental HepG2 cells. Principal component and unsupervised hierarchical cluster analyses were applied and a differentiation of samples of cells (parental, 1.8RI, 2.3RI, 3.0RI, and 3.5RI) was demonstrated (3000–2800cm−1 in the lipid and 1700–1500cm−1 in the protein regions. The FTIR spectra were preprocessed with several treatments to test the algorithm. PLS-R models were built using the 1170 spectra of the HepG2 cells. Cross-validation was used to evaluate prediction of the RI value using this model. PLS-R models—preprocessed with the second derivative FTIR spectra—yielded the best model (R2=0.99, RMSEE=0.095 and RPD=7.98). Most RI values were predicted with high accuracy (91–100%) such that the linear correlation between the actual and predicted RI values was nearly perfect (slope~1). FTIR microspectroscopy combined with chemometric analysis using PLS-R offers quick, accurate, and reliable quantitative analysis of HepG2 cell resistance.

Abstract: Pseudolaric acid B (PAB) is the major bioactive constituent in the root bark of Pseudolarix kaempferi and has been reported to have cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Our in vivo experiments showed that PAB could inhibit gastric cancer cell lung metastasis in a nude mouse haematogenous dissemination model. To evaluate the anti-metastasis mechanism of PAB in gastric cancer cells, cytological experiments were performed. The results showed that PAB could inhibit the adhesion ability to matrigel, migration, invasion and colony formation ability of BGC-823 and MKN-45 cells. Western blot further confirmed that the inhibitory effects of PAB on anti-metastasis may involve regulating the expression of the metastasis-related proteins MMP-9, HIF-1α, VEGF, VEGFR2, E-Cadherin and Ezrin. We obtained further proof that PAB which could be used as a multi-targeted agent to inhibit the PI3K/AKT, ERK1/2 and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathways and consequently suppress tumor growth and metastasis. Our experiments suggest that PAB-induced effects may have novel therapeutic applications for the treatment of gastric cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Although resistance toward small-molecule chemotherapeutics has been well studied, the potential of tumor cells to avoid destruction by membrane-lytic compounds remains unexplored. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are a class of such agents that disrupt tumor cell membranes through rapid and non-stereospecific mechanisms, encouraging the perception that cellular resistance toward ACPs is unlikely to occur. We demonstrate that eukaryotic cells can, indeed, develop resistance to the model oncolytic peptide SVS-1, which preferentially disrupts the membranes of cancer cells. Utilizing fission yeast as a model organism, we show that ACP resistance is largely controlled through the loss of cell-surface anionic saccharides. A similar mechanism was discovered in mammalian cancer cells where removal of negatively charged sialic acid residues directly transformed SVS-1-sensitive cell lines into resistant phenotypes. These results demonstrate that changes in cell-surface glycosylation play a major role in tumor cell resistance toward oncolytic peptides.

Abstract: Folding of the myosin head often requires the joint actions of Hsp90 and a dedicated UNC45, Cro1, She4 (UCS) domain-containing cochaperone protein. Relatively weak sequence conservation exists between the single UCS protein of simple eukaryotes (She4 in budding yeast) and the two UCS proteins of higher organisms (the general cell and smooth muscle UNC45s; UNC45-GC and UNC45-SM respectively). In vertebrates, UNC45-GC facilitates cytoskeletal function whereas the 55% identical UNC45-SM assists in the assembly of the contractile apparatus of cardiac and skeletal muscles. UNC45-SM, unlike UNC45-GC, shares with yeast She4 an IDSL sequence motif known to be a site of in vivo serine phosphorylation in yeast. Investigating this further, we found that both a non-phosphorylatable (S18A) and a phosphomimetic (S18E) mutant form of She4 could rescue the type 1 myosin localisation and endocytosis defects of the yeast she4Δ mutant at 39 °C. Nevertheless, at higher temperature (45 °C), only She4 (S18A), not She4(S18E), could substantially rescue the cell lysis defect of she4Δ mutant cells. In the yeast two-hybrid system, the non-phosphorylatable S18A and S251A mutant forms of She4 and UNC45-SM still displayed the stress-enhanced in vivo interaction with Hsp90 seen with the wild-type She4 and UNC45-SM. Such high-temperature enforcement to interaction was though lost with the phosphomimetic mutant forms (She4(S18E) and UNC45-SM (S251E)), an indication that phosphorylation might suppress these increases in She4/Hsp90 and UNC45-SM/Hsp90 interaction with stress.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide which is closely related to metastasis. Our previous study has shown that MRTF-A promote the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells and WDR1 promotes breast cancer cell migration. But the exact molecular mechanism on metastasis is still not fully understood, we now report that WDR1 enhanced the effect of MRTF-A induced-MDA-MB-231 cell migration by promoting the expression of the EMT markers and migration markers via RhoA-MRTF-A signaling pathway. Importantly, WDR1 promoted the nuclear importion of MRTF-A by affecting the expression of nuclear transport protein importin. But WDR1 did not affect the expression of MRTF-A. Interestingly, MRTF-A promoted the expression of miR-206 via its promoter CArG box but miR-206 inhibits the migration of breast cancer cells through suppressing the expression of WDR1 and MRTF-A via targeted their 3′UTR. Our data thus provide important and novel insights into MRTF-A-miR-206-WDR1 form feedback loop to regulate breast cancer cell migration.

Abstract: Summary
Ebola virus (EBOV) infection is characterized by sporadic outbreaks caused by zoonotic transmission. Fixed changes in amino acid sequence, such as A82V in the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) that occurred early in the 2013–16 epidemic, are suspected to confer a selective advantage to the virus. We used biochemical assays of GP function to show that A82V, as well as a polymorphism in residue 544 identified in other outbreaks, enhances infection by decreasing the threshold for activation of membrane fusion activity triggered by the host factors cathepsin B and Niemann-Pick C1. Importantly, the increase in infectivity comes with the cost of decreased virus stability. Thus, emergence of a virus GP with altered properties that can affect transmission and virulence may have contributed to the severity and scope of the 2013–16 EBOV epidemic.

Abstract: Background and aims
Nephropathy involves pathophysiological changes to the glomerulus. The primary glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) have emerged as an important tool for studying glomerulosclerotic mechanisms and in the screening process for drug-candidates. The success of the studies is dependent on the quality of the cell model. Therefore, we set out to establish an easy, reproducible model of the quiescent endothelial monolayer with the use of commercially available extracellular matrices (ECMs).
Methods
Primary hGEnCs were seeded on various ECMs. Cell adhesion was monitored by an impedance sensing system. The localization of junctional proteins was assessed by immunofluorescence and the barrier function by passage of fluorescent dextrans and magnitude of VEGF response.
Results
All ECM matrices except recombinant human laminin 111 (rhLN111) supported comparable cell proliferation. Culturing hGEnCs on rhLN521, rhLN511 or fibronectin resulted in a physiologically relevant barrier to 70kDa dextrans which was 82% tighter than that formed on collagen type IV. Furthermore, only hGEnCs cultured on rhLN521 or rhLN511 showed plasma-membrane localized zonula occludens-1 and vascular endothelial cadherin indicative of proper tight and adherens junctions (AJ).
Conclusion
We recommend culturing hGEnCs on the mature glomerular basement membrane laminin - rhLN521 – which, as the only commercially available ECM, promotes all of the characteristics of the quiescent hGEnC monolayer: cobblestone morphology, well-defined AJs and physiological perm-selectivity.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence suggests that Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a central role in controlling bone mass. We previously reported that constitutive activation of β-catenin (CA-β-catenin) in osteoblasts potentially has side effects on the bone growth and bone remodeling process, although it could increase bone mass. The present study aimed to observe the effects of osteoblastic CA-β-catenin on bone quality and to investigate possible mechanisms of these effects. It was found that CA-β-catenin mice exhibited lower mineralization levels and disorganized collagen in long bones as confirmed by von Kossa staining and sirius red staining, respectively. Also, bone strength decreased significantly in CA-β-catenin mice. Then the effect of CA-β-catenin on biological functions of osteoblasts were investigated and it was found that the expression levels of osteocalcin, a marker for the late differentiation of osteoblasts, decreased in CA-β-catenin mice, while the expression levels of osterix and alkaline phosphatase, two markers for the early differentiation of osteoblasts, increased in CA-β-catenin mice. Furthermore, higher proliferation rate were revealed in osteoblasts that were isolated from CA-β-catenin mice. The Real-time PCR and western blot examination found that the expression level of c-myc and cyclin D1, two G1 progression-related molecules, increased in osteoblasts that were isolated from the CA-β-catenin mice, and the expression levels of CDK14 and cyclin Y, two mitotic-related molecules that can accelerate cells entering into S and G2/M phases, increased in osteoblasts that were isolated from the CA-β-catenin mice. In summary, osteoblastic CA-β-catenin kept osteoblasts in high proliferative state and impaired the terminal osteoblast differentiation, and this led to changed bone structure and decreased bone strength.

Abstract: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common and aggressive cancer caused by the malignant transformation of B cells. Although it has been established that the follicular helper T (Tfh) cells play a central role in B cell development, little information is available on their involvement in DLBCL pathogenesis. We studied the role of the peripheral Tfh equivalent, the CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells, in DLBCL. Data showed that compared to CXCR5- CD4+ T cells, CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells were significantly more effective at promoting the proliferation as well as inhibiting the apoptosis of primary autologous DLBCL tumor cells. Surprisingly, we found that at equal cell numbers, CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells in DLBCL patients secreted significantly less interleukin (IL)-21 than CXCR5- CD4+ T cells, while the level of IL-10 secretion was significant elevated in the CXCR5+ compartment compared to the CXCR5- compartment. Neutralization of IL-10 in the primary DLBCL-CXCR5+ CD4+ T cell coculture compromised the CXCR5+ CD4+ T cell-mediated pro-tumor effects, in a manner that was dependent on the concentration of anti-IL-10 antibodies. The CXCR5+ compartment also contained significantly lower frequencies of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells than the CXCR5- compartment. In conclusion, our investigations discovered a previously unknown pro-tumor role of CXCR5-expressing circulating CD4+ T cells, which assisted the survival and proliferation of primary DLBCL cells through IL-10.

Abstract: In previous studies we showed that during Freund's adjuvant induced inflammation rat mesenteric mesothelial cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition type II (EMT). This process was characterized by a dramatic increase of the number of cell organelles and volume of mesothelial cells. After the inflammation reached its maximum, the mesenchymal-like cells gradually regained their epithelial phenotype (mesenchymal-epithelial transition, MET). During the recovery process, the decrease of the number of cell organelles was accompanied by an increasing number of autophagic structures in the cytoplasm, indicating that autophagy might play crucial role in MET. Morphometric data of this study showed that the number of the autophagic organelles increased by the time of inflammation and was the highest at day 7–8, when regeneration started. These morphological observations were supported by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analyses with various markers, directly or indirectly involved in this process. Endocytic markers were expressed at high level during both EMT and MET, while the expression of factors regulating autophagy simultaneously changed with the morphology: p-Akt and p-mTOR level was high at day 3–5 and significantly decreased when autophagy speeded up. The Beclin-1, which is the key factor of initiating autophagy, was expressed at the early time of inflammation. These results strongly suggest that autophagy plays important role in regeneration (MET), and it is regulated and synchronized by various signalling events during inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Inflammasome activation is an important innate immune defense mechanism against bacterial infection, and in return, bacteria express virulence determinants that counteract inflammasome activation. Many such effectors are secreted into host cells via specialized bacterial secretion systems. Here, the intracellular pathogenic bacterium Edwardsiella tarda was demonstrated to activate NLRC4 and NLRP3 inflammasomes via a type III secretion system (T3SS), and to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome via a type VI secretion system (T6SS), indicating the antagonistic roles of these systems in inflammasome signaling. Furthermore, a non-VgrG T6SS effector, EvpP, was identified that significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Subsequent studies revealed that EvpP significantly suppressed Jnk activation, thus impairing oligomerization of the inflammasome adaptor ASC. Moreover, EvpP counteracted cytoplasmic Ca2+ increase, which works upstream of Jnk activation to regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Finally, EvpP-mediated inflammasome inhibition promoted bacterial colonization in vivo. This work expands our understanding of bacterial T6SS in counteracting host immune responses.

Abstract: Summary
Recent progress in the field of genetic code reprogramming using a reconstituted cell-free translation system has made it possible to incorporate a wide array of non-proteinogenic amino acids, including N-methyl-amino acids and D-amino acids. Despite the fact that up to ten N-methyl-amino acid residues can be continuously elongated, the successive incorporation of even two D-amino acids into a nascent peptide chain remains a formidable challenge, thus far being nearly impossible. Here we report achievement of continuous D-amino acid elongation by the use of engineered tRNAs and optimized concentrations of translation factors, enabling us to incorporate up to ten consecutive D-Ser residues into a nascent peptide chain. We have also expressed macrocyclic peptides consisting of four or five consecutive D-amino acids consisting of D-Phe, D-Ser, D-Ala, or D-Cys closed by either a disulfide bond or a thioether bond.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus aureus employs the receptor histidine kinase (RHK), AgrC, to detect quorum-sensing (QS) pheromones, the autoinducer peptides (AIPs), which regulate the virulence of the bacterium. Variation in the QS circuit divides S. aureus into four subgroups, each producing a specific AIP-AgrC pair. While the timing of QS induction is known to differ among these subgroups, the molecular basis of this phenomenon is unknown. Here, we report the successful reconstitution of several AgrC variants and show that the agonist-induced activity of the receptors varies in a manner that accounts for these temporal differences in QS induction. Our studies also reveal a key regulatory hotspot on AgrC that controls the basal activity of RHK as well as the responsiveness of the system to ligand inputs. Collectively, these studies offer insights into the capacity of the RHK for adaptive evolution.

Abstract: Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to be involved in initiation, progression and metastasis of various cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of how CAFs affects the biological function of oral cancer (OC) has not been fully-addressed. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-124 was downregulated in oral CAFs and oral cancer cells (OCCs) when compared with matched normal fibroblasts (NFs). Hypermethylation in the promoter region of miR-124 genes was accounted for its downregulation. Interestingly, CAFs but not NFs exerted promotion effect on OCCs cell proliferation, migration and tumor growth in CAFs/NFs-OCCs co-culture. Furthermore, we identified Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and Interleukin 8 (IL-8) as two direct targets of miR-124. Over-expression of miR-124 in CAFs-OCCs co-culture abrogated CAFs-promoted OCCs cell growth and migration, and this inhibitory effect can be rescued by addition of CCL2 and IL-8. Finally, we showed that restoration of miR-124 expression by lentiviral infection or formulated miR-124 injection inhibited oral tumor growth in vivo suggesting miR-124 rescue could be a potential rationale for therapeutic applications in oral cancer in the future.

Abstract: Array Tomography (AT) is a relatively easy-to-use and yet powerful method to put molecular identity in its full ultrastructural context. Ultrathin sections are stained with fluorophores and then imaged by light and afterward by electron microscopy to obtain a correlated view of a region of interest: its ultrastructure and specific staining. By combining AT with high-pressure freezing for superior structural preservation and superresolution light microscopy, even small subcellular structures can be mapped in 3D. We established protocols for the application of superresolution AT on ultrathin plastic sections of Caenorhabditis elegans, Trypanosoma brucei, and brain tissue of Cataglyphis fortis and Apis mellifera. All steps are described in detail from sample preparation to 3D reconstruction, including species-specific modifications. We thus showcase the versatility of our protocol and give some examples for biological questions that can be answered with this technique. We offer a step-by-step recipe for superresolution AT that can be easily applied for C. elegans, T. brucei, C. fortis, and A. mellifera and adapted for other model systems.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke, the second leading cause of death worldwide, leads to excessive glutamate release, over-activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), and massive influx of calcium (Ca2+), which may activate calpain and caspase-3, resulting in cellular damage and death. Memantine is an uncompetitive NMDAR antagonist with low-affinity/fast off-rate. We investigated the potential mechanisms through which memantine protects against ischemic stroke in vitro and in vivo. Middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO) was performed to establish an experimental model of ischemic stroke. The neuroprotective effects of memantine on ischemic rats were evaluated by neurological deficit scores and infarct volumes. The activities of calpain and caspase-3, and expression levels of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) and postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95) were determined by Western blotting. Additionally, Nissl staining and immunostaining were performed to examine brain damage, cell apoptosis, and neuronal loss induced by ischemia. Our results show that memantine could significantly prevent ischemic stroke-induced neurological deficits and brain infarct, and reduce ATP depletion-induced neuronal death. Moreover, memantine markedly suppressed the activation of the calpain-caspase-3 pathway and cell apoptosis, and consequently, attenuated brain damage and neuronal loss in MCAO rats. These results provide a molecular basis for the role of memantine in reducing neuronal apoptosis and preventing neuronal damage, suggesting that memantine may be a promising therapy for stroke patients.

ETS transcription factor ELF5 induces lumen formation in a 3D model of mammary morphogenesis and its expression is inhibited by Jak2 inhibitor TG101348,

Abstract: The loss of expression of a single gene can revert normal tissue to a malignant phenotype. For example, while normal breast has high lumenal expression of CEACAM1, the majority of breast cancers exhibit the early loss of this gene with the concurrent loss of their lumenal phenotype. MCF7 cells that lack CEACAM1 expression and fail to form lumena in 3D culture, regain the normal phenotype when transfected with CEACAM1. In order to probe the mechanism of this gain of function, we treated these cells with the clinically relevant Jak2 inhibitor TG101348 (TG), expecting that disruption of the prolactin receptor signaling pathway would interfere with the positive effects of transfection of MCF7 cells with CEACAM1. Indeed, lumen formation was inhibited, resulting in the down regulation of a set of genes, likely involved in the complex process of lumen formation. As expected, inhibition of the expression of many of these genes also inhibited lumen formation, confirming their involvement in a single pathway. Among the genes identified by the inhibition assay, ETS transcription factor ELF5 stood out, since it has been identified as a master regulator of mammary morphogenesis, and is associated with prolactin receptor signaling. When ELF5 was transfected into the parental MCF7 cells that lack CEACAM1, lumen formation was restored, indicating that ELF5 can replace CEACAM1 in this model system of lumenogenesis. We conclude that the event(s) that led to the loss of expression of CEACAM1 is epistatic in that multiple genes associated with a critical pathway were affected, but that restoration of the normal phenotype can be achieved with reactivation of certain genes at various nodal points in tissue morphogenesis.

Abstract: Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The life cycle of this protozoan parasite is digenetic because it alternates its different developmental forms through two hosts, a vector insect and a vertebrate host. As a result, the parasites are exposed to sudden and drastic environmental changes causing cellular stress. The stress response to some types of stress has been studied in T. cruzi, mainly at the molecular level; however, data about ultrastructure and physiological state of the cells in stress conditions are scarce or null. In this work, we analyzed the morphological, ultrastructural, and physiological changes produced on T. cruzi epimastigotes when they were exposed to acid, nutritional, heat, and oxidative stress. Clear morphological changes were observed, but the physiological conditions varied depending on the type of stress. The maintenance of the physiological state was severely affected by heat shock, acidic, nutritional, and oxidative stress. According to the surprising observed growth recovery after damage by stress alterations, different adaptations from the parasite to these harsh conditions were suggested. Particular cellular death pathways are discussed.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the hypoxia-induced erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic cells. In this study, we identified that miR-486 was a rapid response miRNA to hypoxia in erythroleukemia TF-1 cells. Hypoxia exposure increased both intracellular and miR-486 levels of TF-1 cells. Ectopic miR-486 expression enhanced the growth and erythroid differentiation of TF-1 cells, whereas miR-486 inhibition suppressed their growth and erythroid differentiation. Treatment of TF-1 and cord blood CD34+ cells with exogenous containing miR-486 resulted in an increase of intracellular miR-486 level and enhanced erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, we identified that Sirt1 is a miR-486 target gene which modulates hypoxia-induced erythroid differentiation of TF-1 cells. Thus we identified a novel miRNA regulatory network that contributes to hypoxia-induced erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic cells.

Abstract: Tooth formation during embryogenesis is controlled through a complex interplay between mechanical and chemical cues. We have previously shown that physical cell compaction of dental mesenchyme cells during mesenchymal condensation is responsible for triggering odontogenic differentiation during embryogenesis, and that expression of Collagen VI stabilizes this induction. In addition, we have shown that synthetic polymer scaffolds that artificially induce cell compaction can induce embryonic mandible mesenchymal cells to initiate tooth differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. As embryonic cells would be difficult to use for regenerative medicine applications, here we explored whether compressive scaffolds coated with Collagen VI can be used to induce adult bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) to undergo an odontogenic lineage switch. These studies revealed that when mouse BMSCs are compressed using these scaffolds they increase expression of critical markers of tooth differentiation in vitro, including the key transcription factors Pax9 and Msx1. Implantation under the kidney capsule of contracting scaffolds bearing these cells in mice also resulted in local mineralization, calcification and production of dentin-like tissue. These findings show that these chemically-primed compressive scaffolds can be used to induce adult BMSCs to undergo a lineage switch and begin to form dentin-like tissue, thus raising the possibility of using adult BMSCs for future tooth regeneration applications.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging is one of the most widely applied methods in live science. Here we describe two setups for live-cell imaging, which can easily be combined with volume SEM for correlative studies. The first procedure applies cell culture dishes with a gridded glass support, which can be used for any light microscopy modality. The second approach is a flow-chamber setup based on Ibidi μ-slides. Both live-cell imaging strategies can be followed up with serial blockface- or focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy. Two types of resin embedding after heavy metal staining and dehydration are presented making best use of the particular advantages of each imaging modality: classical en-bloc embedding and thin-layer plastification. The latter can be used only for focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy, but is advantageous for studying cell-interactions with specific substrates, or when the substrate cannot be removed. En-bloc embedding has diverse applications and can be applied for both described volume scanning electron microscopy techniques. Finally, strategies for relocating the cell of interest are discussed for both embedding approaches and in respect to the applied light and scanning electron microscopy methods.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are highly associated with therapy resistance and metastasis. Interplay between CSCs and various immune components is required for tumor survival. However, the response of CSCs to complement surveillance remains unknown. Herein, using stem-like sphere-forming cells prepared from a mammary tumor and a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, we found that CD59 was upregulated to protect CSCs from complement-dependent cytotoxicity. CD59 silencing significantly enhanced complement destruction and completely suppressed tumorigenesis in CSC-xenografted nude mice. Furthermore, we identified that SOX2 upregulates CD59 in epithelial CSCs. In addition, we revealed that SOX2 regulates the transcription of mCd59b, leading to selective mCD59b abundance in murine testis spermatogonial stem cells. Therefore, we demonstrated that CD59 regulation by SOX2 is required for stem cell evasion of complement surveillance. This finding highlights the importance of complement surveillance in eliminating CSCs and may suggest CD59 as a potential target for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Most human neurodegenerative diseases are sporadic and appear later in life. Aging and neurodegeneration are closely associated, and recent investigations reveal that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in the progression of these features. Immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) is an ER chaperone that is central to ER functions. We produced knock-in mice expressing a mutant BiP that lacked the retrieval sequence to elucidate the effect of a functional defect in an ER chaperone in multicellular organisms. The homozygous mutant BiP mice died within several hours after birth because of respiratory failure with an impaired biosynthesis of pulmonary surfactant by alveolar type II cells. The heterozygous mutant BiP mice grew up to be apparently normal adults, although some of them revealed motor disabilities as they aged. Here, we report that the synthesis of a mitochondrial protein, pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1), is enhanced in the brains of homozygous mutant BiP mice. We performed a two-dimensional gel analysis followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. PYCR1 was identified as one of the enhanced proteins. We also found that sublethal ER stress caused by tunicamycin treatment induced the synthesis of PYCR1 in murine fibroblasts. PYCR1 has been shown to be related to the aging process. Mutations in the PYCR1 gene cause cutis laxa with progeroid features and mental retardation. These findings suggest a pathophysiological interaction between ER stress and a mitochondrial function in aging.

Abstract: Summary
Fungal polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large, multidomain enzymes that biosynthesize a wide range of natural products. A hallmark of these megasynthases is the iterative use of catalytic domains to extend and modify a series of enzyme-bound intermediates. A subset of these iterative PKSs (iPKSs) contains a C-methyltransferase (CMeT) domain that adds one or more S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-derived methyl groups to the carbon framework. Neither the basis by which only specific positions on the growing intermediate are methylated (“programming”) nor the mechanism of methylation are well understood. Domain dissection and reconstitution of PksCT, the fungal non-reducing PKS (NR-PKS) responsible for the first isolable intermediate in citrinin biosynthesis, demonstrates the role of CMeT-catalyzed methylation in precursor elongation and pentaketide formation. The crystal structure of the S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) coproduct-bound PksCT CMeT domain reveals a two-subdomain organization with a novel N-terminal subdomain characteristic of PKS CMeT domains and provides insights into co-factor and ligand recognition.

Abstract: Background
Canine osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common cancer of the appendicular skeleton and is associated with high metastatic rate to the lungs and poor prognosis. Recent studies have shown the impact of malignant-derived exosomes on immune cells and the facilitation of immune evasion. In the current study, we have characterized the proteomic profile of exosomes derived from healthy osteoblasts and osteosarcoma cell lines. We investigated the direct impact of these exosomes on healthy T cells.
Results
Proteomic cargo of the malignant exosomes was markedly different from osteoblastic exosomes and contained immunosuppressive proteins including TGF-β, α fetoprotein and heat shock proteins. OSA exosomes directly attenuated the rate of T cell proliferation, increased a regulatory (FoxP3+) CD4+ phenotype and diminished the expression of the activation marker CD25+ on CD8+ cells. Exosomes of osteoblasts also demonstrated a direct impact on T cells, but to a lesser degree.
Conclusions
Osteosarcoma-derived exosomes compared to normal osteoblasts contain an immunomodulatory cargo, which reduced the rate of T cell proliferation and promoted T regulatory phenotype. Osteoblast-derived exosomes can also reduce T cell activity, but to lesser degree compared to OSA exosomes and without promoting a T regulatory phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Chemical modification of proteins provides great opportunities to control and visualize living systems. The most common way to modify proteins is reaction of their abundant amines with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters. Here we explore the impact of amine number and positioning on protein-conjugate behavior using streptavidin-biotin, a central research tool. Dye-NHS modification of streptavidin severely damaged ligand binding, necessitating development of a new streptavidin-retaining ultrastable binding after labeling. Exploring the ideal level of dye modification, we engineered a panel bearing 1–6 amines per subunit: “amine landscaping.” Surprisingly, brightness increased as amine number decreased, revealing extensive quenching following conventional labeling. We ultimately selected Flavidin (fluorophore-friendly streptavidin), combining ultrastable ligand binding with increased brightness after conjugation. Flavidin enhanced fluorescent imaging, allowing more sensitive and specific cell labeling in tissues. Flavidin should have wide application in molecular detection, providing a general insight into how to optimize simultaneously the behavior of the biomolecule and the chemical probe.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells arise from mesoderm-derived hemogenic endothelium (HE) during embryogenesis in a process termed endothelial-hematopoietic transition (EHT). To better understand the gene networks that control this process, we investigated the role of the transcription factor HEB (TCF12) by disrupting the TCF12 gene locus in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and inducing them to differentiate toward hematopoietic outcomes. HEB-deficient hESCs retained key features of pluripotency, including expression of SOX2 and SSEA-4 and teratoma formation, while NANOG expression was reduced. Differentiation of HEB−/− hESCs toward hematopoietic fates revealed a severe defect in mesodermal development accompanied by decreased expression of regulators of mesoendodermal fate choices. We also identified independent defects in HE formation at the molecular and cellular levels, as well as a failure of T cell development. All defects were largely rescued by re-expression of HEB. Taken together, our results identify HEB as a critical regulator of human mesodermal and hematopoietic specification.

Abstract: Summary
In early mouse pre-implantation development, primitive endoderm (PrE) precursors are platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) positive. Here, we demonstrated that cultured mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) express PDGFRα heterogeneously, fluctuating between a PDGFRα+ (PrE-primed) and a platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1)-positive state (epiblast-primed). The two surface markers can be co-detected on a third subpopulation, expressing epiblast and PrE determinants (double-positive). In vitro, these subpopulations differ in their self-renewal and differentiation capability, transcriptional and epigenetic states. In vivo, double-positive cells contributed to epiblast and PrE, while PrE-primed cells exclusively contributed to PrE derivatives. The transcriptome of PDGFRα+ subpopulations differs from previously described subpopulations and shows similarities with early/mid blastocyst cells. The heterogeneity did not depend on PDGFRα but on leukemia inhibitory factor and fibroblast growth factor signaling and DNA methylation. Thus, PDGFRα+ cells represent the in vitro counterpart of in vivo PrE precursors, and their selection from cultured mESCs yields pure PrE precursors.

Abstract: We present a series of ten patients with non-reconstructable peripheral vascular disease (PVD), secondary to arteriosclerosis (AS) and/or diabetes mellitus (DM), treated with local injection of non-expanded autologous, adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells for the purposes of enhancing neovascularization and chronic wound healing. Adipose tissue was surgically harvested and processed to yield the heterogeneous SVF cells for immediate point-of-care injection. The gastrocnemius muscles and ulcers or wounds where present were locally injected with the resulting SVF. Response to treatment was evaluated both clinically based on pain-free ambulation, wound healing capacity over time and ankle/brachial index (ABI) measurements, and by imaging using MRI-based angiography. All patients exhibited clinical improvement (reduction in rest pain and claudication and improvements in ABI), with imaging signs of neovascularization in the majority (5 of 6) of patients in whom the evaluation was feasible. Similarly, 5 of 6 chronic wounds healed without further surgical intervention. This series highlights the utility of non-expanded adipose-derived heterogeneous SVF cell population processed at the point-of-care, to treat patients with end-stage PVD as an alternative to palliation or amputation.

Abstract: The contributions of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), particularly bone loss, have not been clearly explored. The imbalance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is a major reason for bone loss. The dysfunction of osteoblasts, which are derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), induced bone erosion occurs earlier and is characterized as more insidious. Here, we showed that the nuclear expression and translocation of Ahr were both significantly increased in MSCs from collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. The enhanced Ahr suppressed the mRNA levels of osteoblastic markers including Alkaline phosphatase (Alp) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) in the differentiation of MSCs to osteoblasts in CIA. The 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-mediated activation of Ahr dose-dependently suppressed the expression of osteoblastic markers. In addition, the expression of β-catenin was reduced in CIA MSCs compared with control, and the TCDD-mediated activation of the Ahr significantly inhibited β-catenin expression. The Wnt3a-induced the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway partly rescued the osteogenesis decline induced by TCDD. Taken together, these results indicate that activated Ahr plays a negative role in CIA MSCs osteogenesis, possibly by suppressing the expression of β-catenin.

Abstract: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G gene seems to play a pivotal role in maternal tolerance to the fetus. Little is known about HLA-G expression and its molecular control during in vivo human embryogenesis. Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) provide an interesting in vitro model to study early human development. Different studies reported discrepant findings on whether HLA-G mRNA and protein are present or absent in hESC. Several lines of evidence indicate that promoter CpG methylation and 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) polymorphisms may influence HLA-G expression. We investigated how HLA-G expression is linked to the patterns of promoter methylation and explored the role of the 3′UTR polymorphic sites and their binding microRNAs on the post-transcriptional regulation of HLA-G in eight hESC lines. We showed that, while the gross expression levels of HLA-G are controlled by promoter methylation, the genetic constitution of the HLA-G 3′UTR, more specifically the 14bp insertion in combination with the +3187A/A and +3142G/G SNP, plays a major role in HLA-G mRNA regulation in hESC. Our findings provide a solid first step towards future work using hESC as tools for the study of early human developmental processes in normal and pregnancy-related disorders such as preeclampsia.

Abstract: Skeletal muscle performs an essential function in human physiology with defects in genes encoding a variety of cellular components resulting in various types of inherited muscle disorders. Muscular dystrophies (MDs) are a severe and heterogeneous type of human muscle disease, manifested by progressive muscle wasting and degeneration. The disease pathogenesis and therapeutic options for MDs have been investigated for decades using rodent models, and considerable knowledge has been accumulated on the cause and pathogenetic mechanisms of this group of human disorders. However, due to some differences between disease severity and progression, what is learned in mammalian models does not always transfer to humans, prompting the desire for additional and alternative models. More recently, zebrafish have emerged as a novel and robust animal model for the study of human muscle disease. Zebrafish MD models possess a number of distinct advantages for modeling human muscle disorders, including the availability and ease of generating mutations in homologous disease-causing genes, the ability to image living muscle tissue in an intact animal, and the suitability of zebrafish larvae for large-scale chemical screens. In this chapter, we review the current understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in MDs, the process of myogenesis in zebrafish, and the structural and functional characteristics of zebrafish larval muscles. We further discuss the insights gained from the key zebrafish MD models that have been so far generated, and we summarize the attempts that have been made to screen for small molecules inhibitors of the dystrophic phenotypes using these models. Overall, these studies demonstrate that zebrafish is a useful in vivo system for modeling aspects of human skeletal muscle disorders. Studies using these models have contributed both to the understanding of the pathogenesis of muscle wasting disorders and demonstrated their utility as highly relevant models to implement therapeutic screening regimens.

Abstract: Neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte, PMN) recruitment in the liver sinusoid takes place in almost all liver diseases and contributes to pathogen clearance or tissue damage. While PMN rolling unlikely appears in liver sinusoids and Mac-1 or CD44 is assumed to play respective roles during in vivo local or systematic inflammatory stimulation, the regulating mechanisms of PMN adhesion and crawling dynamics are still unclear from those in vivo studies. Here we developed a two-dimensional in vitro sinusoidal model with primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells (KCs) to investigate TNF-α-induced PMN recruitment under shear flow. Our data demonstrated that LFA-1 dominates the static or shear resistant adhesion of PMNs while Mac-1 decelerates PMN crawling on LSEC monolayer. Any one of LFA-1, Mac-1, and CD44 molecules is not able to work effectively for mediating PMN transmigration across LSEC monolayer. The presence of KCs only affects the randomness of PMN crawling. These findings further the understandings of PMN recruitment under shear flow in liver sinusoids.

Abstract: Macrophages play a pivotal role in host immune response against mycobacterial infection, which is tightly modulated by multiple factors, including microRNAs. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the biological function and potential mechanism of miR-32-5p in human macrophages during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection. The results demonstrated that miR-32-5p was robustly enhanced in THP-1 and U937 cells in response to M.tb infection. TLR-4 signaling was required for upregulation of miR-32-5p induced by M.tb infection. Additionally, the introduction of miR-32-5p strongly increased the survival rate of intracellular mycobacteria, whereas inhibition of miR-32-5p suppressed intracellular growth of mycobacteria during M.tb challenged. Furthermore, forced expression of miR-32-5p dramatically attenuated the accumulation of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α induced by M.tb infection. Conversely, downregulated expression of miR-32-5p led to enhancement in these inflammatory cytokines. More importantly, our study explored that Follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1) was a direct and functional target of miR-32-5p. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis further validated that miR-32-5p negatively regulated the expression of FSTL1. Mechanistically, re-expression of FSTL1 attenuated the ability of miR-32-5p to promote mycobacterial survival. Meanwhile, miR-32-5p-mediated inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine production were completely reversed by overexpression of FSTL1. Collectively, our findings demonstrated a novel role of TLR-4/miRNA-32-5p/FSTL1 in the modulation of host defense against mycobacterial infection, which may provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis and useful information for developing potential therapeutic interventions against the disease.

Abstract: Reactive oxygen species damage various cell components including DNA, proteins, and lipids, and these impairments could be a reason for severe human diseases including atherosclerosis. Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), an important metabolic transcription factor, upregulates antioxidant and proapoptotic genes during oxidative stress. Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) forms high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles that are responsible for cholesterol transfer from peripheral tissues to liver for removal in bile in vertebrates. The main sources for plasma ApoA-I in mammals are liver and jejunum. Hepatic apoA-I transcription depends on a multitude of metabolic transcription factors. We demonstrate that ApoA-I synthesis and secretion are decreased during H2O2-induced oxidative stress in human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Here, we first show that FOXO1 binds to site B of apoA-I hepatic enhancer and downregulates apoA-I gene activity in HepG2 cells. Moreover, FOXO1 and LXRα transcription factors participate in H2O2-triggered downregulation of apoA-I gene together with Src, JNK, p38, and AMPK kinase cascades. Mutations of sites B or C as well as the administration of siRNAs against FOXO1 or LXRα to HepG2 cells abolished the hydrogen peroxide-mediated suppression of apoA-I gene.

Abstract: Osteoblasts and osteoclasts coordinate to monitor the dynamic osteogenic balance between bone formation and bone resorption. Hence, an investigation of the regulatory mechanisms underlying osteogenic osteoblast differentiation will provide more methods for bone repair and bone regeneration. In the present study, human osteoblast hFOB 1.19 cells were cultured. MicroRNA-214 (miR-214) expression significantly down-regulated during the osteogenic differentiation of hFOB 1.19 cells. In addition, miR-214 overexpression by miR-214 precursor transfection markedly inhibited the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen type I α1 (col1α1) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), which concomitantly decreased ALP activity and the number of mineralized nodules but promoted the expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), an osteogenesis blocker. We next found that miR-214 inhibited the expression of baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 7 (BIRC7), a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins family. However, BIRC7 overexpression, which was induced by plasmid transfection, notably reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-214, indicating a potential BIRC7-dependent osteogenic differentiation manner mediated by miR-214. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that miR-214 suppresses osteogenesis by targeting BIRC7, providing a possible therapeutic target for bone degenerative diseases.

Abstract: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration is implicated in restenosis. Myosin binding protein H (MYBPH) is capable of reducing cell motility and metastasis. In this study, we sought to determine whether MYBPH is involved in VSMC migration and neointima formation in response to vascular injury. To determine the expression of MYBPH in injured artery, we used a standard rat carotid artery balloon-injury model. In vivo studies have demonstrated that MYBPH is upregulated after vascular injury. VSMCs treated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB displayed increased MYBPH mRNA and protein levels. PDGF-induced VSMC migration was inhibited by adenovirus-mediated expression of MYBPH whereas it was enhanced by small interfering RNA knockdown of MYBPH. The activation of ROCK1 was repressed by MYBPH. Luminal delivery of MYBPH adenovirus to carotid arteries decreased neointimal hyperplasia in vivo. MYBPH may, therefore, serve as a novel therapeutic target for postangioplasty restenosis.

Abstract: Summary
The generation of functional arterial endothelial cells (aECs) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) holds great promise for vascular tissue engineering. However, the mechanisms underlying their generation and the potential of aECs in revascularizing ischemic tissue are not fully understood. Here, we observed that hypoxia exposure of mouse ESCs induced an initial phase of HIF1α-mediated upregulation of the transcription factor Etv2, which in turn induced the commitment to the EC fate. However, sustained activation of HIF1α in these EC progenitors thereafter induced NOTCH1 signaling that promoted the transition to aEC fate. We observed that transplantation of aECs mediated arteriogenesis in the mouse hindlimb ischemia model. Furthermore, transplantation of aECs in mice showed engraftment in ischemic myocardium and restored cardiac function in contrast to ECs derived under normoxia. Thus, HIF1α activation of Etv2 in ESCs followed by NOTCH1 signaling is required for the generation aECs that are capable of arteriogenesis and revascularization of ischemic tissue.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are rare cells that generate all the various types of blood and immune cells. High-quality transcriptome data have enabled the identification of significant genes for HSCs. However, most genes are expressed in various forms by alternative splicing (AS), extending transcriptome complexity. Here, we delineate AS to determine which isoforms are expressed in mouse HSCs. Our analysis of microarray and RNA-sequencing data includes differential expression of splicing factors that may regulate AS, and a complete map of splicing isoforms. Multiple types of isoforms for known HSC genes and unannotated splicing that may alter gene function are presented. Transcriptome-wide identification of genes and their respective isoforms in mouse HSCs will open another dimension for adult stem cells.

Abstract: Mechanical unloading leads to bone loss and disuse osteoporosis partly due to impaired osteoblastogenesis of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated that cyclic mechanical stretch (CMS) promotes osteoblastogenesis of BMSCs both in vivo and in vitro. Besides, we found that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway was activated in this process. Inhibition of which by either knockdown of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) or treating BMSCs with Hh inhibitors attenuated the osteogenic effect of CMS on BMSCs, suggesting that Hh signaling pathway acts as an endogenous mediator of mechanical stimuli on BMSCs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Shh expression level was regulated by DNA methylation mechanism. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that DNA methyltransferase 3b (Dnmt3b) binds to Shh gene promoter, leading to DNA hypermethylation in mechanical unloading BMSCs. However, mechanical stimulation down-regulates the protein level of Dnmt3b, results in DNA demethylation and Shh expression. More importantly, we found that inhibition of Dnmt3b partly rescued bone loss in HU mice by mechanical unloading. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that mechanical stimulation regulates osteoblastic genes expression via direct regulation of Dnmt3b, and the therapeutic inhibition of Dnmt3b may be an efficient strategy for enhancing bone formation under mechanical unloading.

Abstract: Closed head injury (CHI) usually results in severe and permanent neurological impairments, which are caused by several intertwined phenomena, such as cerebral edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neuronal loss, astroglial scarring and inflammation. We previously reported that induced neural stem cells (iNSCs), similar to neural stem cells (NSCs), can accelerate neurological recovery in vivo and produce neurotrophic factors in vitro. However, the effects of iNSC neurotrophy following CHI were not determined. Moreover, whether iNSCs have immunomodulatory properties is unknown. Mouse models of CHI were established using a standardized weight-drop device and assessed by neurological severity score (NSS). Although these models fail to mimic the complete spectrum of human CHI, they reproduce impairment in neurological function observed in clinical patients. Syngeneic iNSCs or NSCs were separately transplanted into the brains of CHI mice at 12h after CHI. Neurological impairment post-CHI was evaluated by several tests. Animals were sacrificed for morphological and molecular biological analyses. We discovered that iNSC administration promoted neurological functional recovery in CHI mice and reduced cerebral edema, BBB disruption, cell death and astroglial scarring following trauma. Implanted iNSCs could up-regulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) levels to support the survival of existing neurons after CHI. In addition, engrafted iNSCs decreased immune cell recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the brain post-injury. Moreover, we found significant nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) inhibition in the presence of iNSC grafts. In short, iNSCs exert neurotrophic and immunomodulatory effects that mitigate CHI-induced neurological impairment.

Abstract: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). This experiment was designed to study the expression and role of the miRNA, miR-132, in IDD. MiR-132 expression in human nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. The methylation status of the miR-132 was assessed with methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR. The regulation of growth differentiation factor5 (GDF5) expression by miR-132 was evaluated by luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, we investigated the function of miR-132 on IDD in vivo using a classic needle-punctured rat tail model. These results showed that miR-132 expression was upregulated during IDD and this upregulation was associated with hypomethylation of its promoter. MiR-132 overexpression led to increased expression of ECM catabolic factors, including MMP13 and ADAMTS4, in NP cells while levels of anabolic proteins, such as type II collagen and aggrecan, were diminished. GDF5 was identified as a direct target of negative regulation by miR-132. MAPK/ERK signaling was also found to be associated with miR-132-induced ECM degradation. In addition, we showed that miR-132 inhibition effectively attenuated NP ECM degradation in IDD in vivo. Our findings demonstrated that miR-132 promotes ECM degradation by human NP cells by direct targeting of GDF5. Hence, miR-132 represents a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of IDD.

Abstract: Oxidative stress represents a major cause of cellular damage and death in the process of osteoporosis. Antimycin A (AMA) has been shown to stimulate mitochondrial superoxide anions and reactive oxygen species (ROS). α-Lipoic acid (α-LA) is a naturally occurring essential coenzyme in mitochondrial multienzyme complexes and acts as a key player in mitochondrial energy production. However, whether α-LA affects the cytotoxicity of AMA in osteoblastic cells is unknown. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of α-LA against AMA-induced cytotoxicity using the MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cell line. Our results indicated that α-LA treatment attenuated AMA-induced cytotoxicity and LDH release in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, a significant recovery effect of α-LA on mineralization inhibited by AMA was found. Our results also demonstrated that treatment with 50μm AMA leads to a reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the complex IV dysfunction, which was inhibited by pretreatment with α-LA in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, treatment with α-LA significantly reduced the generation of ROS and mitochondrial superoxide production induced by AMA. In addition, our result suggests that PI3K/Akt and CREB pathways are related to the protective effect of α-LA. Importantly, Hoechst 33258 staining results indicated that pretreatment with α-LA prevented AMA-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, we found that α-LA prevents MC3T3-E1 cells from apoptosis through attenuating cytochrome C release and reducing the level of cleaved caspase-3.

Abstract: In lower-order vertebrates, Müller glia exhibit characteristics of retinal progenitor cells, while in higher vertebrates, such as mammals, the regenerative capacity of Müller glia is limited. Recently, we reported that Lin28b promoted the trans-differentiation of Müller cells to rod photoreceptor and bipolar cells in the retina of retinitis pigmentosa rat model, whereas it is unclear whether Lin28b can stimulate the reprogramming of Müller glia in vitro for transplantation into a damaged retina. In the present study, Long-Evens rat Müller glia were infected with Adeno-Lin28b or Adeno-GFP. Over-expression of Lin28b in isolated rat Müller glia resulted in the suppression of GFAP expression, enhancement of cell proliferation and a significant increase of the expression of retinal progenitor markers 5 days after infection. Moreover, Lin28b caused a significant reduction of the Let-7 family of microRNAs. Following sub-retinal space transplantation, Müller glia-derived retinal progenitors improved b-wave amplification of 30d Royal College of Surgeons retinitis pigmentosa model (RCS-P+) rats, as detected by electroretinography (ERG) recordings. Taken together, these data suggest that the up-regulation of Lin28b expression facilitated the reprogramming of Müller cells toward characteristics of retinal progenitors.

Abstract: Summary
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly used drugs in the world. While the role of NSAIDs as cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors is well established, other targets may contribute to anti-inflammation. Here we report caspases as a new pharmacological target for NSAID family drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketorolac at physiologic concentrations both in vitro and in vivo. We characterize caspase activity in both in vitro and in cell culture, and combine computational modeling and biophysical analysis to determine the mechanism of action. We observe that inhibition of caspase catalysis reduces cell death and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Further, NSAID inhibition of caspases is COX independent, representing a new anti-inflammatory mechanism. This finding expands upon existing NSAID anti-inflammatory behaviors, with implications for patient safety and next-generation drug design.

Abstract: Cellular reprogramming proceeds in a stepwise pathway initiated by binding and transcription of pluripotency factors followed by genome-wide epigenetic changes. Priming events, such as erasure of DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling determines the success of pluripotency acquisition later. Therefore, growing efforts are made to understand epigenetic regulatory network that makes reprogramming possible and efficient. Here, we analyze the role of transcriptional corepressor TRIM28, involved in heterochromatin formation, during the process of reprogramming of mouse somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). We demonstrate that Trim28 knockdown (Trim28 KD) causes that emerging iPS cells differentiate immediately back into MEFs therefore they fail to yield stable iPS cell colonies. To better comprehend the mechanism of TRIM28 action in reprogramming, we performed a reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) using in excess of 300 different antibodies and compared the proteomic profiles of wild-type and Trim28 KD cells during reprogramming. We revealed the differences in the dynamics of reprogramming of wild-type and Trim28 KD cells. Interestingly, proteomic profile of Trim28 KD cells at the final stage of reprogramming resembled differentiated state rather than maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal, strongly suggesting spontaneous differentiation of Trim28 KD cells back to their parental cell type. We also observed that action of TRIM28 in reprogramming is accompanied by differential enrichment of proteins involved in cell cycle, adhesion and stemness. Collectively, these results suggest that regulation of epigenetic modifications coordinated by TRIM28 plays a crucial role in reprogramming process.

Abstract: The last step of cytokinesis, abscission, consists in the severing of the intercellular bridge connecting the two daughter cells. Because daughter cells move randomly on regular cell culture substrates, the use of adhesive micropatterns facilitates the observation of the intercellular bridge and its severing. Here we propose general rules to design micropatterns optimized to study this process. In particular, these micropatterns allow a good stabilization of the daughter cells and a predictable positioning of the intercellular bridge. We suggest a series of micropatterns controlling various cellular parameters such as distance between daughter cells or daughter cells polarization. We give recommendations for videomicroscopy acquisition during cell division and propose automated image analysis methods using kymograph analysis or bridge detection. Finally, we detail methods to artificially cut the intercellular bridge using UV-based laser ablation or using two-photons laser ablation.

Abstract: Summary
CRISPR loci are a cluster of repeats separated by short “spacer” sequences derived from prokaryotic viruses and plasmids that determine the targets of the host’s CRISPR-Cas immune response against its invaders. For type I and II CRISPR-Cas systems, single-nucleotide mutations in the seed or protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) of the target sequence cause immune failure and allow viral escape. This is overcome by the acquisition of multiple spacers that target the same invader. Here we show that targeting by the Staphylococcus epidermidis type III-A CRISPR-Cas system does not require PAM or seed sequences, and thus prevents viral escape via single-nucleotide substitutions. Instead, viral escapers can only arise through complete target deletion. Our work shows that, as opposed to type I and II systems, the relaxed specificity of type III CRISPR-Cas targeting provides robust immune responses that can lead to viral extinction with a single spacer targeting an essential phage sequence.

Abstract: Summary
Growing evidence implicates the importance of glia, particularly astrocytes, in neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here, we describe a rapid and robust method for the differentiation of highly pure populations of replicative astrocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), via a neural progenitor cell (NPC) intermediate. We evaluated this protocol across 42 NPC lines (derived from 30 individuals). Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that hiPSC-astrocytes from four individuals are highly similar to primary human fetal astrocytes and characteristic of a non-reactive state. hiPSC-astrocytes respond to inflammatory stimulants, display phagocytic capacity, and enhance microglial phagocytosis. hiPSC-astrocytes also possess spontaneous calcium transient activity. Our protocol is a reproducible, straightforward (single medium), and rapid (<30 days) method to generate populations of hiPSC-astrocytes that can be used for neuron-astrocyte and microglia-astrocyte co-cultures for the study of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Promoting neurogenesis is a promising strategy for the treatment of cognition impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ganoderma lucidum is a revered medicinal mushroom for health-promoting benefits in the Orient. Here, we found that oral administration of the polysaccharides and water extract from G. lucidum promoted neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation to enhance neurogenesis and alleviated cognitive deficits in transgenic AD mice. G. lucidum polysaccharides (GLP) also promoted self-renewal of NPC in cell culture. Further mechanistic study revealed that GLP potentiated activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT cascades. Consistently, inhibition of FGFR1 effectively blocked the GLP-promoted NPC proliferation and activation of the downstream cascades. Our findings suggest that GLP could serve as a regenerative therapeutic agent for the treatment of cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: We have previously shown that human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) are highly permissive cells for respiratory viruses including influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus. Recent studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in virus-host relationship, and this led us to investigate its essential roles in the in vitro hNECs model derived from multiple donors. By comparing the differential expression of miRNAs upon IAV infection among animal and cell line studies, candidates were selected with focus on the initial immune response. After infection of influenza H3N2 virus, hNECs showed constant increase virus titer at 24–72h post-infection (hpi); accompanied with a significantly elevated level of miR-146a-5p at 72 hpi. The exponential elevation of progeny virus titer correlated with a key influenza sensing Toll-like receptor (TLR)7 pathway. TLR7 downstream gene transcripts, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), interferon regulator factor 7 (IRF7), and interferon-β (IFN-β) were significantly upregulated at 48 and 72 hpi, while interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and TNF receptor associated factor-6 (TRAF6) were unchanged. Interestingly, when miR-146a was overexpressed with miRNA mimics prior to H3N2 infection, further decreased transcripts of TRAF6, but not IRAK1, were detected. By using the in vitro hNEC model, we demonstrated that H3N2-induced miR-146a specifically targets and regulates TRAF6 expression; but not IRAK expression in the nasal epithelium. We also found that unlike the cell model studies that lead to our studies, when ran across a heterogeneous model of different individual, miRNA signals were highly varied and the expression of most miRNAs, including miR-146a-5p, was more subdued compared to homogenous cell line model, highlighting a need for a more thorough analysis of miRNA signals and targets in a model more mimicking a clinical influenza infection.

Abstract: Summary
Maintaining properties of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in culture for regenerative applications remains a great challenge. An emerging approach of constructing a culture environment mimicking the bone marrow niche to regulate BMSC activities has been developed. In this study, we have demonstrated a systematic approach to identify soluble factors of interest extracted from human bone marrow and used them in BMSC culture for tissue regeneration. We have found that lipocalin-2 and prolactin are key factors in bone marrow, involved in regulating BMSC activities. Treating the cell with lipocalin-2 and prolactin delays cellular senescence of BMSCs and primes the cell for osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. We have also demonstrated that BMSCs pretreated with lipocalin-2 and prolactin can enhance the repair of calvarial defects in mice. Together, our study provides research evidence of using a viable approach to prime BMSC properties in vitro for improving cell-based tissue regeneration in vivo.

Abstract: Genomic information has become a ubiquitous and almost essential aspect of biological research. Over the last 10–15 years, the cost of generating sequence data from DNA or RNA samples has dramatically declined and our ability to interpret those data increased just as remarkably. Although it is still possible for biologists to conduct interesting and valuable research on species for which genomic data are not available, the impact of having access to a high quality whole genome reference assembly for a given species is nothing short of transformational. Research on a species for which we have no DNA or RNA sequence data is restricted in fundamental ways. In contrast, even access to an initial draft quality genome (see below for definitions) opens a wide range of opportunities that are simply not available without that reference genome assembly. Although a complete discussion of the impact of genome sequencing and assembly is beyond the scope of this short paper, the goal of this review is to summarize the most common and highest impact contributions that whole genome sequencing and assembly has had on comparative and evolutionary biology.

Abstract: Summary
During antibacterial autophagy, ubiquitination of intracellular bacteria recruits proteins that mediate bacterial delivery to the lysosome for degradation. Smurf1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase whose role in selective bacterial autophagy is unknown. We show that Smurf1 facilitates selective autophagy of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Smurf1−/− macrophages are defective in recruiting polyubiquitin, the proteasome, the ubiquitin-binding autophagy adaptor NBR1, the autophagy protein LC3, and the lysosomal marker LAMP1 to Mtb-associated structures and are more permissive for Mtb growth. This function of Smurf1 requires both its ubiquitin-ligase and C2 phospholipid-binding domains, and involves K48- rather than K63-linked ubiquitination. Chronically infected Smurf1−/− mice have increased bacterial load, increased lung inflammation, and accelerated mortality. SMURF1 controls Mtb replication in human macrophages and associates with bacteria in lungs of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, Smurf1 is required for selective autophagy of Mtb and host defense against tuberculosis infection.

Abstract: A growing body of evidence suggests type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the precise mechanisms remain unclear, T2DM may exacerbate neurodegenerative processes. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling is an evolutionary preserved pathway that is important during homeostatic energy biogenesis responses at both the cellular and whole-body levels. Metformin, a ubiquitously prescribed anti-diabetic drug, exerts its effects by AMPK activation. However, while the roles of AMPK as a metabolic mediator are generally well understood, its performance in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration are not yet well defined. Given hyperglycemia is accompanied by an accelerated rate of advanced glycosylation end product (AGE) formation, which is associated with the pathogenesis of diabetic neuronal impairment and, inflammatory response, clarification of the role of AMPK signaling in these processes is needed. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that metformin, an AMPK activator, protects against diabetic AGE induced neuronal impairment in human neural stem cells (hNSCs). In the present study, hNSCs exposed to AGE had significantly reduced cell viability, which correlated with elevated inflammatory cytokine expression, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α. Co-treatment with metformin significantly abrogated the AGE-mediated effects in hNSCs. In addition, metformin rescued the transcript and protein expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and inhibitory kappa B kinase (IKK) in AGE-treated hNSCs. NF-κB is a transcription factor with a key role in the expression of a variety of genes involved in inflammatory responses, and metformin did prevent the AGE-mediated increase in NF-κB mRNA and protein levels in the hNSCs exposed to AGE. Indeed, co-treatment with metformin significantly restored inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels in AGE-treated hNSCs. These findings extend our understanding of the central role of AMPK in AGE induced inflammatory responses, which increase the risk of neurodegeneration in diabetic patients.

Abstract: Summary
CD8+ T cells may play a dual role in protection against and pathogenesis of flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV). We evaluated the CD8+ T cell response in ZIKV-infected LysMCre+IFNARfl/fl C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice lacking the type I interferon receptor in a subset of myeloid cells. In total, 26 and 15 CD8+ T cell-reactive peptides for ZIKV African (MR766) and Asian (FSS13025) lineage strains, respectively, were identified and validated. CD8+ T cells from infected mice were polyfunctional and mediated cytotoxicity. Adoptive transfer of ZIKV-immune CD8+ T cells reduced viral burdens, whereas their depletion led to higher tissue burdens, and CD8−/− mice displayed higher mortality with ZIKV infection. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CD8+ T cells protect against ZIKV infection. Further, this study provides a T cell competent mouse model for investigating ZIKV-specific T cell responses.

Abstract: Melanoma is a rare and aggressive skin tumor; the survival of patients diagnosed late is fairly low. This high mortality rate is due to the characteristics of the cells that allow them to be resistant to radiotherapy and conventional chemotherapy, besides of being able to evade the immune system. Melanin, the pigment responsible for skin, hair and eye color, seems to be involved in this resistance. The main function of melanin is to protect the cells against ultraviolet (UV) light by absorbing this radiation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. But this pigment may have also a role as photosensitizer, because when it is irradiated with UVA light (320-400 nm), the generation of ROS was detected. Besides, the melanogenesis stimulation on B16-F10 cells resulted in cell cycle arrest, induction of a quiescent state, change in the expression of several proteins and alterations on ADP/ATP ratio. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of melanogenesis stimulation in mitochondrial function of B16-F10 melanoma cells. Therefore, we analyzed cells respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and mitochondria mass in B16-F10 melanoma cells stimulated with 0.4mML-tyrosine and 10mM NH4Cl. Our results showed that the induction of melanin synthesis was able to reduce significantly the oxygen consumption after 48h of stimulation, without changes of mitochondrial membrane potential when compared to non-stimulated cells. Despite of respiration inhibition, the mitochondria mass was higher in cells with melanogenesis stimulation. We suggest that the stimulation in the melanin synthesis might be promoting the inhibition of electrons transport chain by some intermediate compound from the synthesis of the pigment and this effect could contribute to explain the entry in the quiescent state.

Abstract: Heat shock proteins (HSPs), molecular chaperones, are crucial for the cancer cells to facilitate proper functioning of various oncoproteins involved in cell survival, proliferation, migration, and tumor angiogenesis. Tumor cells are said to be “addicted” to HSPs. HSPs are overexpressed in many cancers due to upregulation of transcription factor Heat-shock factor 1 (HSF-1), the multifaceted master regulator of heat shock response. Therefore, pharmacological targeting of HSPs via HSF-1 is an effective strategy to treat malignant cancers like triple negative breast cancer. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of a pyrrole derivative [bis(2-ethylhexyl)1H-pyrrole-3,4-dicarboxylate], TCCP, purified from leaves of Tinospora cordifolia for its ability to suppress heat shock response and angiogenesis using MDA-MB-231 cells and the murine mammary carcinoma: Ehrlich ascites tumor model. HSP90 was downregulated by TCCP by inactivation of HSF-1 resulting in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, VEGF-induced cell migration, and concomitant decrease in tumor burden and neo-angiogenesis in vivo. The mechanism of suppression of HSPs involves inactivation of PI3K/Akt and phosphorylation on serine 307 of HSF-1 by the activation of ERK1. HSF-1 and HSP90 and 70 localization and expression were ascertained by immunolocalization, immunoblotting, and qPCR experiments. The anti-angiogenic effect of TCCP was studied in vivo in tumor-bearing mice and ex vivo using rat corneal micro-pocket assay. All the results thus corroborate the logic behind inactivating HSF-1 using TCCP as an alternative approach for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) provide an unlimited source of donor cells for potential cardiac regenerative therapies. However, hPSC-CMs are immature. For instance, hPSC-CMs are only 1/10 of the physical size of their adult counterparts; the majority are mono- rather than bi- or multi-nucleated, which is an evolutionary adaptive feature in metabolically active cells such as adult CMs. Here, we attempted to increase the physical size and nucleation status of hPSC-derived ventricular (V) cardiomyocytes (hPSC-VCMs) using chemically-induced cell fusion, and examined the subsequent functional effects. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was employed to fuse a 1:1 mixture of lentiviral vectors LV-MLC2v-GFP- or –tdTomato-labeled hPSC-VCMs, such that hPSC-VCMs fused syncytia (FS) were identified as doubly GFP+/tdTomato+ multi-nucleated cells. These microscopically-identified FS were doubled in size as gauged by their capacitance when compared to the control mononucleated hPSC-VCMs using patch-clamp analysis. Reduced automaticity or action potential (AP) firing rate and moderately prolonged AP duration were observed in FS from day 6 post-fusion induction. However, Ca2+ handling, mitochondrial biogenesis and the extent of apoptosis were not significantly altered. We conclude that larger, multi-nucleated hPSC-VCMs FS can be created by chemically-induced cell fusion but global maturation requires additional triggering cues.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are frequently used as a therapeutic, but reliable imaging technique to longitudinally evaluate the engraftment of transplanted cells is inadequate. For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is essential to understand the technical competence of in vitro stem cells labeling with iron oxide with regard to its relaxation behavior and significance of its biological expressions. The purpose of the study was to optimize the effective labeling of MSCs with high transverse relaxivity iron oxide contrast agent with protamine sulfate and also evaluate the biological effects (phenotype and function) of labeled MSCs. Our results demonstrated that 50:3µg/ml of Fe-Pro complex containing 10% serum at an incubation time of 6h were ideal for effective in vitro labeling. Relaxometry study demonstrated that almost an 8-fold increase in relaxation rate (R2) was observed in labeled MSCs by comparing with unlabeled. Marginal alteration in Oct4 and CD146 genes, and phenotypic CD45 expressions were detected after labeling. T2-weighted images and histological analysis confirmed the homing of transplanted cells to the site of injury. The relaxometry based optimized labeling method of MSCs could be extrapolated for cellular MRI and may be useful in stem cell tracking in various pre-clinical and clinical studies.

Abstract: Extracellular heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is recognized by receptors on the plasma membrane, such as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), TLR2, CD14, and CD40. This leads to activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhancement of the phagocytic activity of innate immune cells, and stimulation of antigen-specific responses. However, the specific characteristics of HSP70 binding are still unknown, and all HSP70 receptors have not yet been described. Putative models for HSP70 complexation to the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGEs), considering both ADP- and ATP-bound states of HSP70, were obtained through molecular docking and interaction energy calculations. This interaction was detected and visualized by a proximity fluorescence-based assay in A549 cells and further analyzed by normal mode analyses of the docking complexes. The interacting energy of the complexes showed that the most favored docking situation occurs between HSP70 ATP-bound and RAGE in its monomeric state. The fluorescence proximity assay presented a higher number of detected spots in the HSP70 ATP treatment, corroborating with the computational result. Normal-mode analyses showed no conformational deformability in the interacting interface of the complexes. Results were compared with previous findings in which oxidized HSP70 was shown to be responsible for the differential modulation of macrophage activation, which could result from a signaling pathway triggered by RAGE binding. Our data provide important insights into the characteristics of HSP70 binding and receptor interactions, as well as putative models with conserved residues on the interface area, which could be useful for future site-directed mutagenesis studies.

Abstract: Summary
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) arises from neurodegeneration in the frontal, insular, and anterior temporal lobes. Autosomal dominant causes of FTD include heterozygous mutations in the GRN gene causing haploinsufficiency of progranulin (PGRN) protein. Recently, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been identified as enhancers of PGRN expression, although the mechanisms through which GRN is epigenetically regulated remain poorly understood. Using a chemogenomic toolkit, including optoepigenetic probes, we show that inhibition of class I HDACs is sufficient to upregulate PGRN in human neurons, and only inhibitors with apparent fast binding to their target HDAC complexes are capable of enhancing PGRN expression. Moreover, we identify regions in the GRN promoter in which elevated H3K27 acetylation and transcription factor EB (TFEB) occupancy correlate with HDAC-inhibitor-mediated upregulation of PGRN. These findings have implications for epigenetic and cis-regulatory mechanisms controlling human GRN expression and may advance translational efforts to develop targeted therapeutics for treating PGRN-deficient FTD.

Abstract: Summary
Pharmacological modulation of transcription factors (TFs) has only met little success over the past four decades. This is mostly due to standard drug discovery approaches centered on blocking protein/DNA binding or interfering with post-translational modifications. Recent advances in the field of TF biology have revealed a central role of protein-protein interaction in their mode of action. In an attempt to modulate the activity of SOX18 TF, a known regulator of vascular growth in development and disease, we screened a marine extract library for potential small-molecule inhibitors. We identified two compounds, which inspired a series of synthetic SOX18 inhibitors, able to interfere with the SOX18 HMG DNA-binding domain, and to disrupt HMG-dependent protein-protein interaction with RBPJ. These compounds also perturbed SOX18 transcriptional activity in a cell-based reporter gene system. This approach may prove useful in developing a new class of anti-angiogenic compounds based on the inhibition of TF activity.

Abstract: Summary
Patients with glioblastoma die from local relapse despite surgery and high-dose radiotherapy. Resistance to radiotherapy is thought to be due to efficient DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in stem-like cells able to survive DNA damage and repopulate the tumor. We used clinical samples and patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) to confirm that the DSB repair protein RAD51 is highly expressed in GSCs, which are reliant on RAD51-dependent DSB repair after radiation. RAD51 expression and RAD51 foci numbers fall when these cells move toward astrocytic differentiation. In GSCs, the small-molecule RAD51 inhibitors RI-1 and B02 prevent RAD51 focus formation, reduce DNA DSB repair, and cause significant radiosensitization. We further demonstrate that treatment with these agents combined with radiation promotes loss of stem cells defined by SOX2 expression. This indicates that RAD51-dependent repair represents an effective and specific target in GSCs.

Abstract: Summary
Cell ablation is a strategy to study cell lineage and function during development. Optogenetic methods are an important cell-ablation approach, and we have previously developed a mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG) tool that works in the living Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we use directed evolution to generate miniSOG2, an improved tool for cell ablation via photogenerated reactive oxygen species. We apply miniSOG2 to a far more complex model animal system, Drosophila melanogaster, and demonstrate that it can be used to kill a single neuron in a Drosophila larva. In addition, miniSOG2 is able to photoablate a small group of cells in one of the larval wing imaginal discs, resulting in an adult with one incomplete and one normal wing. We expect miniSOG2 to be a useful optogenetic tool for precision cell ablation at a desired developmental time point in live animals, thus opening a new window into cell origin, fate and function, tissue regeneration, and developmental biology.

Abstract: Summary
Organogenesis and tissue development occur through sequential stepwise processes leading to increased lineage restriction and loss of pluripotency. An exception to this appears in the adult human breast, where rare variant epithelial cells exhibit pluripotency and multilineage differentiation potential when removed from the signals of their native microenvironment. This phenomenon provides a unique opportunity to study mechanisms that lead to cellular reprogramming and lineage plasticity in real time. Here, we show that primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) lose expression of differentiated mammary epithelial markers in a manner dependent on paracrine factors and epigenetic regulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HMEC reprogramming is dependent on gene silencing by the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and loss of histone transcriptional marks following downregulation of the methyltransferase DOT1L. These results demonstrate that lineage commitment in adult tissues is context dependent and highlight the plasticity of somatic cells when removed from their native tissue microenvironment.

Abstract: Enveloped viruses induce cell-cell fusion when infected cells expressing viral envelope proteins interact with target cells, or through the contact of cell-free viral particles with adjoining target cells. CD4+ T lymphocytes and cells from the monocyte-macrophage lineage express receptors for HIV envelope protein. We have previously reported that lymphoid Jurkat T cells expressing the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) can fuse with THP-1 monocytic cells, forming heterokaryons with a predominantly myeloid phenotype. This study shows that the expression of monocytic markers in heterokaryons is stable, whereas the expression of lymphoid markers is mostly lost. Like THP-1 cells, heterokaryons exhibited FcγR-dependent phagocytic activity and showed an enhanced expression of the activation marker ICAM-1 upon stimulation with PMA. In addition, heterokaryons showed morphological changes compatible with maturation, and high expression of the differentiation marker CD11b in the absence of differentiation-inducing agents. No morphological change nor increase in CD11b expression were observed when an HIV-fusion inhibitor blocked fusion, or when THP-1 cells were cocultured with Jurkat cells expressing a non-fusogenic Env protein, showing that differentiation was not induced merely by cell-cell interaction but required cell-cell fusion. Inhibition of TLR2/TLR4 signaling by a TIRAP inhibitor greatly reduced the expression of CD11b in heterokaryons. Thus, lymphocyte-monocyte heterokaryons induced by HIV-1 Env are stable and functional, and fusion prompts a phenotype characteristic of activated monocytes via intracellular TLR2/TLR4 signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The role of growth factors (GFs) in controlling the biology of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains limited by a lack of information concerning the individual and combined effects of GFs directly on the survival, Mitogenesis, and regenerative activity of highly purified human HSCs. We show that the initial input HSC activity of such a purified starting population of human cord blood cells can be fully maintained over a 21-day period in serum-free medium containing five GFs alone. HSC survival was partially supported by any one of these GFs, but none were essential, and different combinations of GFs variably stimulated HSC proliferation. However, serial transplantability was not detectably compromised by many conditions that reduced human HSC proliferation and/or survival. These results demonstrate the dissociated control of these three human HSC bio-responses, and set the stage for future improvements in strategies to modify and expand human HSCs ex vivo.

Abstract: Summary
Insects develop efficient antimicrobial strategies to flourish in a bacterial world. It has long been proposed that native gut microbiota is an important component of host defense; however, the responsible species have rarely been isolated to elucidate the mechanism of action. Here we show that the dominant symbiotic bacterium Enterococcus mundtii associated with the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis actively secretes a stable class IIa bacteriocin (mundticin KS) against invading bacteria, but not against other gut residents, facilitating the normal development of host gut microbiota. A mundticin-defective strain lost inhibitory activity. Furthermore, purified mundticin cures infected larvae. Thus, the constitutively produced antimicrobials by native extracellular symbionts create a significant chemical barrier inside limiting invader expansion. This unique property also benefits E. mundtii itself by providing a competitive advantage, contributing to its dominance within complex microbial settings and its prevalence across Lepidoptera, and probably promotes the long-term cooperative symbiosis between both parties.

Abstract: As a potentially unlimited autologous cell source, patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide great capability for tissue regeneration, particularly in spinal cord injury (SCI). However, despite significant progress made in translation of iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to clinical settings, a few hurdles remain. Among them, non-invasive approach to obtain source cells in a timely manner, safer integration-free delivery of reprogramming factors, and purification of NPCs before transplantation are top priorities to overcome. In this study, we developed a safe and cost-effective pipeline to generate clinically relevant NPCs. We first isolated cells from patients' urine and reprogrammed them into iPSCs by non-integrating Sendai viral vectors, and carried out experiments on neural differentiation. NPCs were purified by A2B5, an antibody specifically recognizing a glycoganglioside on the cell surface of neural lineage cells, via fluorescence activated cell sorting. Upon further in vitro induction, NPCs were able to give rise to neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. To test the functionality of the A2B5+ NPCs, we grafted them into the contused mouse thoracic spinal cord. Eight weeks after transplantation, the grafted cells survived, integrated into the injured spinal cord, and differentiated into neurons and glia. Our specific focus on cell source, reprogramming, differentiation and purification method purposely addresses timing and safety issues of transplantation to SCI models. It is our belief that this work takes one step closer on using human iPSC derivatives to SCI clinical settings.

Abstract: Emerging evidence implicates an important role for myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. However, limited knowledge is known about the function of MDSCs in response to chemotherapies. In this study, we find that drug-resistant hepatocellular cancer (HCC) cells-derived conditioned medium significantly enhances the expansion and immunosuppressive function of MDSCs compared to their parental sensitive cells, which is demonstrated by increased level of arginase, nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Next, we reveal that drug-resistant HCC cells-derived IL-6 activated MDSCs, which is demonstrated by using an anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibody that caused a reduced MDSC immunosuppressive activity. More importantly, the depletion of MDSC via the administration of anti-Gr-1 antibody or the blockade of IL-6 signaling sensitized 5-FU-resistant H22 hepatoma to chemotherapy in the immunocompetent C57BL/6N mice. In primary human HCC, IL-6 expression levels strongly correlate with an MDSC phenotype and chemotherapy response in HCC patients. In conclusion, these results describe a role of IL-6 in the drug resistance in HCC chemotherapy and suggest that MDSC-targeting treatments may be potential therapeutic strategy for HCC chemoresistance.

Abstract: Endocytosis is a complex and dynamic process that involves dozens of different proteins to define the site of endocytosis, form a membrane invagination, and pinch off a membrane vesicle into the cytoplasm. Fluorescent light microscopy is a powerful tool to visualize the dynamic behaviors of the proteins taking part in the endocytic process. The resolution of light microscopy is, however, a serious limitation. Here, we detail a fluorescence microscope method that we have developed to visualize the dynamics of the clathrin-mediated endocytic protein machinery in yeast cells. This method is based on subpixel centroid tracking of endocytic proteins. For each endocytic protein, the centroid trajectories obtained from multiple endocytic events are used to compute an average trajectory that describes, at nanometer scale, the assembly and movement of the protein during endocytosis. The average trajectories of the different endocytic proteins are then aligned together in space and time to reconstruct how the different proteins behave relative to each other during the endocytic process.

Abstract: Morphogenesis of an epithelial tissue emerges from the behavior of its constituent cells, including changes in shape, rearrangements, and divisions. In many instances the directionality of these cellular events is controlled by the polarized distribution of specific molecular components. In recent years, our understanding of morphogenesis and polarity highly benefited from advances in genetics, microscopy, and image analysis. They now make it possible to measure cellular dynamics and polarity with unprecedented precision for entire tissues throughout their development. Here we review recent approaches to visualize and measure cell polarity and tissue morphogenesis. The chapter is organized like an experiment. We first discuss the choice of cell and polarity reporters and describe the use of mosaics to reveal hidden cell polarities or local morphogenetic events. Then, we outline application-specific advantages and disadvantages of different microscopy techniques and image projection algorithms. Next, we present methods to extract cell outlines to measure cell polarity and detect cellular events underlying morphogenesis. Finally, we bridge scales by presenting approaches to quantify the specific contribution of each cellular event to global tissue deformation. Taken together, we provide an in-depth description of available tools and theoretical concepts to quantitatively study cell polarity and tissue morphogenesis over multiple scales.
