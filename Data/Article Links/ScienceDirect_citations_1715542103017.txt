Abstract: A multicentre, cross-sectional epidemiological survey was conducted to describe the health status of patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1) in Spain. Patient data were collected retrospectively from clinical records. Therapeutic goals for seven clinical parameters were chosen as primary outcome measures. 108 GD1 patients (mean age 44.8years; 53% male) were recruited from 28 hospitals. Ninety-five patients (88%) were receiving treatment for GD1. Hemoglobin concentration was the therapeutic goal with the highest level of achievement, being met by 105 of 108 patients (97%), followed by the goals for liver volume (86/98 patients; 88%), spleen volume (67/77 patients; 87%) and platelet count (81/108 patients; 75%). The goal for bone mineral density (BMD) was met by 48 of 75 patients (64%), and the goal for quality of life was met by 65 of 103 patients (63%). Bone pain was the parameter with the lowest level of achievement (goal met by 50/94 patients; 53%). The clinical information most often missing from patient records was the BMD Z-score (missing for 31% of patients). These data suggest that most Spanish GD1 patients have good control over hematological and visceral parameters, but there is a need to improve monitoring and treatment of GD-related bone disease.

Abstract: Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been suggested as a precious source for generating functionally competent endothelial cells (ECs), candidate for various clinical applications. However, the paucity of these progenitor cells and the technical difficulties for their in vitro growth represent a main limitation to their use. In the present study we hypothesized that the paracrine effects of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) may improve endothelial cell generation from cord blood (CB) EPCs. In line with this hypothesis we showed that HUVEC conditioned medium (CM) or co-culture with HUVECs markedly improved the proliferation and differentiation and delayed the senescence of CB EPCs. The endothelial-promoting effect of CM seems to be related to smaller vesicles including exosomes (sEV/exo) contained in this medium and transferred to CB CD34+ EPCs: in fact, purified preparations of sEV/exo isolated from CM mimicked the effect of CM to sustain endothelial formation. These observations provided the interesting indication that mature ECs exert a stimulatory effect on endothelial cell differentiation from CD34+ cells.

Abstract: Bone crises in type 1 Gaucher disease are reported in long bones and occasionally in weight bearing bones and other bones, but rarely in small bones of the hands and feet. We retrospectively examined the incidence of bone pain in patients followed at the Rabin Medical Center, Israel, before and following the initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and evaluated them for bone crises. Of 100 type I Gaucher disease patients, 30 (30%) experienced one or more bone crises. Small bone crises represented 31.5% of all bone crises and were always preceded by crises in other bones. While the incidence of long bone crises reduced after the initiation of ERT, small bone crises increased. Almost 60% of patients with bone crises were of the N370S/84GG genotype suggesting a greater susceptibility of N370S/84GG patients to severe bone complications. These patients also underwent the greatest number of splenectomies (70.6% of splenectomised patients). Splenectomised patients showed a trend towards increased long and small bone crises after surgery. Active investigation of acute pain in the hands and feet in patients in our cohort has revealed a high incidence of small bone crises. Physicians should consider imaging studies to investigate unexplained pain in these areas.

Abstract: We evaluate the temporal relation between protein expression by cationic lipid-mediated transfection and cell division using time lapse fluorescence microscopy. Detailed image analysis provides new insights on the single cell level while simultaneously achieving appropriate statistics. Earlier evidence by less direct methods such as flow cytometry indicates a primary route for transfection involving nuclear envelope breakdown, but also suggests the existence of a pathway independent of mitosis. We confirm and quantify both mechanisms. We found the timing for successful transfection to be unexpectedly flexible, contrary to assertions of a narrow time window. Specifically, cells dividing more than 24h after exposure to the transfection medium express the probed protein at a comparable level to cells in a mitotic state during or shortly after transfection. This finding can have a profound impact on the guidance and development of non-viral gene delivery materials.

Abstract: Germline-specific RNA helicase Spindle-E (Spn-E) is known to be essential for piRNA silencing in Drosophila that takes place mainly in the perinuclear nuage granules. Loss-of-function spn-E mutations lead to tandem Stellate genes derepression in the testes and retrotransposon mobilization in the ovaries. However, Spn-E functions in the piRNA pathway are still obscure. Analysis of total library of short RNAs from the testes of spn-E heterozygous flies revealed the presence of abundant piRNA ping-pong pairs originating from Su(Ste) transcripts. The abundance of these ping-pong pairs were sharply reduced in the library from the testes of spn-E mutants. Thus we found that ping-pong mechanism contributed to Su(Ste) piRNA generation in the testes. The lack of Spn-E caused a significant drop of protein levels of key ping-pong participants, Aubergine (Aub) and AGO3 proteins of PIWI subfamily, in the germline of both males and females, but did not disrupt of their assembly in nuage granules. We found that observed decline of the protein expression was not caused by suppression of aub and ago3 transcription as well as total transcription, indicating possible contribution of Spn-E to post-transcriptional regulation.

Abstract: Despite the fact that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate numerous physiological processes and represent targets for therapeutics for a vast array of diseases, their role in tumor biology is under appreciated. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) form a family which belongs to GPCR class A. PAR1&2 emerge with a central role in epithelial malignancies. Although the part of PAR1&2 in cancer is on the rise, their underlying signaling events are poorly understood. We review hereby past, present, and future cancer-associated PAR biology. Mainly, their role in physiological (placenta-cytotophobalst) and patho-physiological invasion processes. The identification and characterization of signal pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain-binding motifs established critical sites for breast cancer growth in PAR1&2. Among the proteins found to harbor important PH-domains and are involved in PAR biology are Akt/PKB as also Etk/Bmx and Vav3. A point mutation in PAR2, H349A, but not R352A, abrogated PH–protein association and is sufficient to markedly reduce PAR2-instigated breast tumor growth in vivo as also placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion in vitro is markedly reduced. Similarly, the PAR1 mutant hPar1-7A, which is unable to bind PH-domain, inhibits mammary tumors and EVT invasion, endowing these motifs with physiological significance and underscoring the importance of these previously unknown PAR1 and PAR2 PH-domain-binding motifs in both pathological and physiological invasion processes.

Abstract: Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1) is an endothelial receptor for oxidized LDL. Increased expression of LOX-1 has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic lesions and diabetic vasculopathy. In this study, we investigate the expression of LOX-1 receptor in sickle cell disease (SCD) vasculopathy. Expression of LOX-1 in brain vascular endothelium is markedly increased and LOX-1 gene expression is upregulated in cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells by incubation with SCD erythrocytes. Also, the level of circulating soluble LOX-1 concentration is elevated in the plasma of SCD patients. Increased LOX-1 expression in endothelial cells is potentially involved in the pathogenesis of SCD vasculopathy. Soluble LOX-1 concentration in SCD may provide a novel biomarker for risk stratification of sickle cell vascular complications.

Abstract: Axonal transport is an essential function in neurons, as mutations in either motor proteins or their adaptors cause neurodegeneration. While some mutations cause a complete block in axonal transport, other mutations affect transport more subtly. This is especially true of mutations identified in human patients, many of which impair but do not block motor function in the cell. Dissecting the pathogenic mechanisms of these more subtle mutations requires assays that can tease apart the distinct phases of axonal transport, including transport initiation, sustained/regulated motility, and cargo-specific sorting or delivery. Here, we describe a live-cell photobleaching assay to assess retrograde flux from the distal axon tip, a measure for distal transport initiation. We have previously used this method to show that the CAP-Gly domain of DCTN1 is required for efficient retrograde transport initiation in the distal axon, but it is not required to maintain retrograde flux along the mid-axon (Moughamian & Holzbaur, 2012). This approach has allowed us to examine the effects of disease-causing mutations in the axonal transport machinery, and in combination with other assays, will be useful in determining the mechanisms and regulation of axonal transport in normal and diseased conditions.

Inactivation of p120 catenin in mice disturbs intrahepatic bile duct development and aggravates liver carcinogenesis,

Abstract: p120 catenin (p120ctn) is required for the stability of classic cadherins at the cell surface and is thought to play a central role in modulating cell–cell adhesion. Cytoplasmic p120ctn promotes cell motility, and probably other activities, by modulating the activities of RhoA, Rac and Cdc42. E-cadherin is expressed in periportal but not in perivenous hepatocytes. In contrast, all hepatocytes of normal mouse liver express N-cadherin. Cholangiocytes express exclusively E-cadherin. Mice with p120ctn ablation in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes (p120LiKO mice) were generated by Cre-loxP technology. Livers were examined by histological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and serum analysis to determine the effect of the p120ctn ablation on liver structure and function. Mouse hepatocyte differentiation and homeostasis were not impaired. However, hepatoblasts differentiated abnormally into hybrid hepato-biliary cells, ductal plate structures were irregular in p120LiKO newborns, and further development of intrahepatic bile ducts was severely impaired. In adults, enrichment of ductular structures was accompanied by portal inflammation and fibrosis. p120LiKO mice did not spontaneously develop hepatocellular carcinoma but initiation of hepatocarcinogenesis by diethylnitrosamine was accelerated. In summary: p120ctn has a critical role in biliary differentiation and is a potent suppressor of liver tumor growth.

Abstract: Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is often aberrantly activated in tumor cells and required for tumor growth. The internalization of Wnt co-receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) induced by Wnt ligands is commonly thought to be critical for Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation. However, in contrast to theses previous studies, we here show that persistent excessive stimulation with a canonical Wnt ligand Wnt3a could induce a long-term decreased expression level of membrane LRP6, which prevented nuclear β-catenin accumulation and tumor cell;proliferation. Importantly, Wnt3a was robustly upregulated following serum deprivation. The upregulated Wnt3a under serum deprivation was responsible for LRP6 internalization, decreased accumulation of nuclear β-catenin, and further inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. It has well been known that insufficient blood supply during tumor development occurs frequently, causing a worsening environment for tumor growth. Therefore, these results reveal a novel inhibitory role of Wnt3a on canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling and cancer cell proliferation when there is an insufficient blood supply during tumor development, which might be a potential mechanism for tumor evasion within a worsening environment.

Abstract: Seventy-kilodalton heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) are molecular chaperones essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Apart from their indispensable roles in protein homeostasis, specific Hsp70s localize at the plasma membrane and bind to specific lipids. The interaction of Hsp70s with lipids has direct physiological outcomes including lysosomal rescue, microautophagy, and promotion of cell apoptosis. Despite these essential functions, the Hsp70-lipid interactions remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we characterized the interaction of HspA1A, an inducible Hsp70, with five phospholipids. We first used high concentrations of potassium and established that HspA1A embeds in membranes when bound to all anionic lipids tested. Furthermore, we found that protein insertion is enhanced by increasing the saturation level of the lipids. Next, we determined that the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of the protein binds to lipids quantitatively more than the substrate-binding domain (SBD). However, for all lipids tested, the full-length protein is necessary for embedding. We also used calcium and reaction buffers equilibrated at different pH values and determined that electrostatic interactions alone may not fully explain the association of HspA1A with lipids. We then determined that lipid binding is inhibited by nucleotide-binding, but it is unaffected by protein-substrate binding. These results suggest that the HspA1A lipid-association is specific, depends on the physicochemical properties of the lipid, and is mediated by multiple molecular forces. These mechanistic details of the Hsp70-lipid interactions establish a framework of possible physiological functions as they relate to chaperone regulation and localization.

Abstract: Summary
Adult stem cells are the ultimate source for replenishment of salivary gland (SG) tissue. Self-renewal ability of stem cells is dependent on extrinsic niche signals that have not been unraveled for the SG. The ductal compartment in SG has been identified as the location harboring stem cells. Here, we report that rare SG ductal EpCAM+ cells express nuclear β-catenin, indicating active Wnt signaling. In cell culture experiments, EpCAMhigh cells respond potently to Wnt signals stimulating self-renewal and long-term expansion of SG organoids, containing all differentiated SG cell types. Conversely, Wnt inhibition ablated long-term organoid cultures. Finally, transplantation of cells pre-treated with Wnt agonists into submandibular glands of irradiated mice successfully and robustly restored saliva secretion and increased the number of functional acini in vivo. Collectively, these results identify Wnt signaling as a key driver of adult SG stem cells, allowing extensive in vitro expansion and enabling restoration of SG function upon transplantation.

Abstract: Cancer cells often arise progressively from “normal” to “pre-cancer” to “transformed” to “local metastasis” to “metastatic disease” to “aggressive metastatic disease”. Recent whole genome sequencing (WGS) and spectral karyotyping (SKY) of cancer cells and tumorigenic models have shown this progression involves three major types of genome rearrangements: ordered small step-wise changes, more dramatic “punctuated evolution” (chromoplexy), and large catastrophic steps (chromothripsis) which all occur in random combinations to generate near infinite numbers of stochastically rearranged metastatic cancer cell genomes. This paper describes a series of mouse cell lines developed sequentially to mimic this type of progression. This starts with the new GhrasT-NIH/Swiss cell line that was produced from the NIH/3T3 cell line that had been transformed by transfection with HRAS oncogene DNA from the T24 human bladder carcinoma. These GhrasT-NIH/Swiss cells were injected s.c. into NIH/Swiss mice to produce primary tumors from which one was used to establish the T1-A cell line. T1-A cells injected i.v. into the tail vein of a NIH/Swiss mouse produced a local metastatic tumor near the base of the tail from which the T2-A cell line was established. T2-A cells injected i.v. into the tail vein of a nude NIH/Swiss mouse produced metastases in the liver and one lung from which the T3-HA (H=hepatic) and T3-PA (P=pulmonary) cell lines were developed, respectively. T3-HA cells injected i.v. into a nude mouse produced a metastasis in the lung from which the T4-PA cell line was established. PCR analysis indicated the human T24 HRAS oncogene was carried along with each in vitro/in vivo transfer step and found in the T2-A and T4-PA cell lines. Light photomicrographs indicate that all transformed cells are morphologically similar. GhrasT-NIH/Swiss cells injected s.c. produced tumors in 4% of NIH/Swiss mice in 6–10 weeks; T1-A cells injected s.c. produced tumors in 100% of NIH/Swiss mice in 7–10 days. T1-A, T-2A, T3-HA and T4-PA cells when injected i.v. into the tail produced local metastasis in non-nude or nude NIH/Swiss mice. T4-PA cells were more widely metastatic than T3-HA cells when injected i.v. into nude mice. Evaluation of the injected mice indicated a general increase in metastatic potential of each cell line in the progression as compared to the GhrasT-NIH/3T3 transformed cells. A new photomicrographic technique to follow growth rates within six preselected 2×2mm2 grids per plate is described. Average doubling times of the transformed cells GhrasT-NIH/3T3 (17h), T1A (17.5h), T2A (15.5h), T3-HA (17.5h) and T4-PA (18.5h) (average 17.2h) were significantly faster (P=0.006) than NIH Swiss primary embryonic cells and NIH/3T3 cells (22 h each). This cell series is currently used in this lab for studies of cancer cell inhibitors, mitochondrial biogenesis and gene expression and is available for further study by other investigators for intra- and inter-laboratory comparisons of WGS, transcriptome sequencing, SKY and other analyses. The genome rearrangements in these cells together with their phenotypic properties may help provide more insights into how one tumorigenic progression occurred to produce the various cell lines that led to the highly metastatic T4-PA cell line.

Abstract: Our aim was to understand the involvement of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) morphogen in the oriented distribution of neural crest cells (NCCs) toward the optic vesicle and to look for potential disorders of this guiding mechanism after ethanol exposure. In vitro directional analysis showed the chemotactic response of NCCs up Shh gradients and to notochord co-cultures (Shh source) or to their conditioned medium, a response inhibited by anti-Shh antibody, receptor inhibitor cyclopamine and anti-Smo morpholino (MO). Expression of the Ptch–Smo receptor complex on in vitro NCCs was also shown. In whole embryos, the expression of Shh mRNA and protein was seen in the ocular region, and of Ptch, Smo and Gli/Sufu system on cephalic NCCs. Anti-Smo MO or Ptch-mutated plasmid (Ptch1Δloop2) impaired cephalic NCC migration/distribution, with fewer cells invading the optic region and with higher cell density at the homolateral mesencephalic level. Beads embedded with cyclopamine (Smo-blocking) or Shh (ectopic signal) supported the role of Shh as an in vivo guide molecule for cephalic NCCs. Ethanol exposure perturbed in vitro and in vivo NCC migration. Early stage embryos treated with ethanol, in a model reproducing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, showed later disruptions of craniofacial development associated with abnormal in situ expression of Shh morphogen. The results show the Shh/Ptch/Smo-dependent migration of NCCs toward the optic vesicle, with the support of specific inactivation with genetic and pharmacological tools. They also help to understand mechanisms of accurate distribution of embryonic cells and of their perturbation by a commonly consumed teratogen, and demonstrate, in addition to its other known developmental functions, a new biological activity of cellular guidance for Shh.

Abstract: A wide range of subcellular organelles, pathogens, and macromolecular complexes are actively transported within neuronal and nonneuronal cells by microtubule motors. Transport speeds range up to 2–3μm/s, which requires millisecond- and nanometer-scale resolution for proper imaging and analysis. Dissecting the contributions of multiple motor types has been challenging because of their functional interdependence and the complexity of individual motor behavior. In this chapter, we describe several methods for motor inhibition coupled with high-resolution particle tracking of vesicular and virus cargoes to provide a detailed and quantitative understanding of motor behavior and regulation. We discuss long-term inhibition, as well as short-term inhibition methods when needed to minimize complications from motor protein interactions.

Abstract: Actin is a highly conserved, key cytoskeletal protein involved in numerous structural and functional roles. In neurons, actin has been intensively investigated in axon terminals—growth cones—and dendritic spines, but details about actin structure and dynamics in axon shafts have remained obscure for decades. A major barrier in the field has been imaging actin. Actin exists as soluble monomers (G-actin) as well as actin filaments (F-actin), and labeling actin with conventional fluorescent probes like GFP/RFP typically leads to a diffuse haze that makes it difficult to discern kinetic behaviors. In a recent publication, we used F-actin selective probes to visualize actin dynamics in axons, resolving striking actin behaviors that have not been described before. However, using these probes to visualize actin dynamics is challenging as they can cause bundling of actin filaments; thus, experimental parameters need to be strictly optimized. Here we describe some practical methodological details related to using these probes for visualizing F-actin dynamics in axons.

Abstract: High levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) reduce sickle cell anemia (SCA) morbidity and mortality. HbF levels vary considerably and there is a strong genetic component that influences HbF production. Genetic polymorphisms at three quantitative trait loci (QTL): Xmn1-HBG2, HMIP-2 and BCL11A, have been shown to influence HbF levels and disease severity in SCA. Hydroxyurea (HU) is a drug that increases HbF. We investigated the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the Xmn1-HBG2 (rs7482144); BCL11A (rs1427407, rs4671393 and rs11886868); and HMIP-2 (rs9399137 and rs9402686) loci on baseline and HU-induced HbF levels in 111 HbSS patients. We found that both BCL11A and HMIP-2 were associated with increased endogenous levels of HbF. Interestingly, we also found that BCL11A was associated with higher induction of HbF with HU. This effect was independent of the effect of BCL11A on baseline HbF levels. Additional studies will be needed to validate these findings and explain the ample inter-individual variations in HbF levels at baseline and HU-induced in patients with SCA.

Abstract: Background
In congenital Factor (F) VII deficiency bleeding phenotype and intrinsic FVII activity levels don't always correlate. Patients with FVII activity levels <30% appear to have a higher bleeding propensity, but bleeding can also occur at higher FVII activity levels. Reasons for bleeding at higher FVII activity levels are unknown, and it remains challenging to manage such patients clinically.
Case
A 19year old male with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage and FVII activity levels of 44%, requiring emergent surgical intervention and a strategy for FVII replacement. Genotyping showed the rare heterozygous FVII 9729del4 mutation. Bleed evacuation was complicated by epidural abscess requiring craniectomy, bone graft procedures, and prolonged administration of recombinant human (rh) activated FVII (FVIIa). The patient recovered without neurological deficits, and remains on prophylactic low dose treatment with rhFVIIa in relation to risky athletic activities.
Conclusion
For clinicians, it is important to recognize that effects of rhFVIIa within these pathways are independent of its contribution to blood clot formation and cannot be assessed by clotting assays. Reduced FVII levels should therefore not be dismissed, as even a mild reduction may result in spontaneous bleeding. Treatment of mild FVII deficiency requires a careful case-by-case approach, based on the clinical scenario.

Abstract: Blood vessels supply tissues and organs with oxygen, nutrients, cellular, and humoral factors, while lymphatic vessels regulate tissue fluid homeostasis, immune trafficking, and dietary fat absorption. Understanding the mechanisms of vascular morphogenesis has become a subject of intense clinical interest because of the close association of both types of vessels with pathogenesis of a broad spectrum of human diseases. The zebrafish provides a powerful animal model to study vascular morphogenesis because of their small, accessible, and transparent embryos. These unique features of zebrafish embryos permit sophisticated high-resolution live imaging of even deeply localized vessels during embryonic development and even in adult tissues. In this chapter, we summarize various methods for blood and lymphatic vessel imaging in zebrafish, including nonvital resin injection–based or dye injection–based vessel visualization, and alkaline phosphatase staining. We also provide protocols for vital imaging of vessels using microangiography or transgenic fluorescent reporter zebrafish lines.

Abstract: Purpose
Despite not yet explored, the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level in hemoglobinopathy SC (HbSC) patients could be a marker of disease severity as this association is strong in sickle cell patients. We hypothesized that the degree of hemolysis in HbSC patients is a key determinant influencing a spectrum of complications that reflect the severity of HbSC vasculopathy. The aim of this study was to analyze the associations between hemolytic parameters and chronic complications in adult SC patients.
Findings
We demonstrated that LDH reflects the overall rate of hemolysis and presents a correlation with the complications related to the hemolytic subphenotype: retinopathy, venous thromboembolism and leg ulcers in HbSC patients. Remarkably, this simple biomarker was associated with a clinical subphenotype of complications in patients with HbSC disease.
Conclusions
We propose that LDH elevation identifies HbSC patients with hemolysis, which could be a marker of endothelial dysfunction and end-organ vasculopathy. The use of this test as a marker of disease severity could complement the decisions taken during HbSC patient management.

Abstract: Gaucher disease (GD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding acid-β-glucosidase, resulting in functional disruptions in degradation of glycosphingolipids and lysosomal accumulation of the substrates. The most frequent clinical presentations of GD are thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly and bone pain. Prior to advent of enzyme replacement therapy, splenectomy was performed for complications of hypersplenism such as severe thrombocytopenia and transfusion dependency. Though there is evidence about worsening bone disease after splenectomy, there is no systematic study to assess its effects on the immune system in GD patients. In order to investigate the long-term immunological effects of splenectomy, we used flow cytometry to compare the immunophenotypes of GD patients who had undergone splenectomy (SGD) to those with intact spleen. The results show that SGD patients have significantly fewer CD27+/IgM+ B-cells but more CD4+/CD45RO+ and CD8+/CD45RO+ T-cells. The most surprising finding was an almost complete absence of circulating dendritic cells in SGD patients. In addition, splenectomized subjects had comorbidities, the most common being monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Taken together, these results highlight the persistence of multiple immune alterations and comorbidities coexisting in higher frequency in the SGD group and they are not affected by GD specific therapy.

Abstract: Invadosomes are actin rich protrusive structures that facilitate invasive migration in multiple cell types. Comprised of invadopodia and podosomes, these highly dynamic structures adhere to and degrade the extracellular matrix, and are also thought to play a role in mechanosensing. Many extracellular signals have been implicated in invadosome stimulation, activating complex signalling cascades to drive the formation, activity and turnover of invadosomes. While the structural components of invadosomes have been well studied, the regulation of invadosome dynamics is still poorly understood. Protein kinases are essential to this regulation, affecting all stages of invadosome dynamics and allowing tight spatiotemporal control of their activity. Invadosome organisation and function have been linked to pathophysiological states such as cancer invasion and metastasis; therapeutic targeting of invadosome regulatory components is thus warranted. In this review, we discuss the involvement of kinase signalling in every stage of the invadosome life cycle and evaluate its significance.

Abstract: Background
The multidrug resistance of leukemia cells is closely related to the microenvironment. The present leukemia microenvironment models focus on two-dimensional co-culture system in vitro which does not mimic the in vivo cell growth, while the 3D polystyrene (PS) scaffolds have the advantage. Stromal cell derived factor-1 may be involved in the shielding of endosteal niche from leukemia cells by binding to its receptor CXCR4, but the relationship between SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and leukemia cells is unclear.
Design and methods
The experiments were built on the 3D PS scaffolds coated with osteoblasts. Stromal cells and MV4-11 cells were plated on the scaffolds. Then G-CSF, AMD3100 and cytarabine were added. Adhesive rate, SDF-1 level, migration state, apoptosis rate, and cell cycle of leukemia cells were observed after incubation at 24h and 48h.
Results
G-CSF decreased the level of SDF-1 and inhibited the expression of CXCR4 and promoted stationary phase leukemia cells to enter the mitotic phase and enhanced the killing effect of chemotherapeutic drugs. AMD3100 disrupted the interaction between tumors and matrix, mobilized the leukemia cells to keep away from the protective microenvironment and strengthened the cytotoxic effect of Ara-C. The combination of G-CSF and AMD3100 had stronger effects on killing the leukemia cells induced by Ara-C.
Conclusion
It demonstrates that AMD3100 and G-CSF may inhibit adhesion and migration abilities of leukemia cells with the bone marrow niche. Both of them inhibit the role of SDF-1/CXCR4 directly or indirectly. Thus inhibiting SDF-1/CXCR4 axis may be helpful to the treatment of refractory AML.

Abstract: Hepcidin, a peptide produced in the liver, decreases intestinal iron absorption and macrophage iron release by causing degradation of the iron exporter, ferroportin. Because its levels are inappropriately low in patients with iron overload syndromes, hepcidin is a potential drug target. We previously conducted a chemical screen that revealed ipriflavone, an orally available small molecule, as a potent inducer of hepcidin expression. To evaluate ipriflavone's effect on iron homeostasis, we placed groups of 5-week old wild type or thalassemia intermedia (HbbTh3+/−) mice on a soy-free, iron-sufficient diet, AIN-93G containing 220mg iron and 0–750mgipriflavone/kg of food for 50days. Ipriflavone 500mg/kg significantly reduced liver iron stores and intestinal ferroportin expression in WT mice, while increasing the ratio of hepcidin transcript levels to liver iron stores. Ipriflavone supplementation in HbbTh3+/− mice failed to alleviate iron overload and was associated with a milder reduction in intestinal ferroportin and a failure to alter the ratio of hepcidin transcript levels to liver iron stores or splenic expression of the hepcidin-regulatory hormone, erythroferrone. These data suggest that dietary supplementation with ipriflavone alone would not be sufficient to treat iron overload in thalassemia intermedia.

Abstract: Water channel proteins, classified as a family of Membrane Intrinsic Proteins (MIPs) superfamily, enable rapid movement of water and small uncharged molecules through biological membranes. Although water channel proteins are required in several important processes characteristic for the animals, such as osmoregulation, mucus secretion, or defense against desiccation, molluscs, until now, have been very poorly explored in this aspect. Therefore, we decided to study MIPs in Helix pomatia L. applied as a model in studies on terrestrial snail physiology. Our studies consisted in: the snail organ transcriptome sequencing and consecutive bioinformatic analysis of the predicted protein, estimation of the encoding transcript expression (qPCR), investigation of the predicted protein function in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, and the phylogenetic analysis. We identified six water channel proteins, named HpAQP1 to HpAQP6. All of them were proven to transport water, two of them (HpAQP3 and HpAQP4) were also shown to be able to transport glycerol, and other two (HpAQP5 and HpAQP6) to transport H2O2. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the proteins either fell into aquaporins (HpAQP1, HpAQP2 and HpAQP5) or formed new groups of invertebrate water channel proteins, not described until now, that we suggest to term malacoglyceroporins (HpAQP3 and HpAQP4) and malacoaquaporins (HpAQP6). Thus, the classification of animal water channels based on the vertebrate proteins and including aquaporin, aquaglyceroporin, S-aquaporin and AQP8-type grades does not reflect diversity of these proteins in invertebrates. The obtained results provide important data concerning diversity of water channel protein repertoire in aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates and should also contribute to the improvement of animal water channel classification system.

Abstract: Skin, by nature, is very similar to the Rouquayrol-Denayrouze suit mentioned by Jules Verne in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea: it allows “to risk (…) new physiological conditions without suffering any organic disorder”. Mechanical cues, to the same extent as other environmental parameters, are such “new physiological conditions”. Indeed, skin’s primary function is to form a protective barrier to shield inner tissues from the external environment. This requires unique mechanical properties as well as the ability to sense mechanical cues from the environment in order to prevent or repair mechanical damages as well as to function as the primary mechanosensory interface of the whole body.

Abstract: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR-ABL have dramatically improved chronic myeloid leukemia therapy. While imatinib remains to be the first line therapy, about 30% of patients develop resistance or intolerance to this drug and are recommended to switch to other TKIs. Nilotinib and dasatinib are currently implemented into the first line therapy and other inhibitors have already entered the clinical practice. This opens further questions on how to select the best TKI for each patient not only during the therapy but also at diagnosis. The individualized therapy concept requires a reliable establishment of prognosis and prediction of response to the available TKIs. We tested the ex vivo sensitivity of patient primary leukocytes to imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib – two concentrations of each inhibitor for 48h incubation – and we evaluated the usefulness of such tests for the clinical practice. Besides reflecting the actual sensitivity to the therapy, our optimized simple tests were able to predict the outcome in 90/87% of patients, for the next 12/24months, respectively. According to these results, the presented ex vivo testing could help clinicians to select the appropriate drug for each patient at diagnosis and also at any time of the therapy.

Abstract: The zebrafish serves as an excellent model to study vertebrate development and disease. Optically clear embryos, combined with tissue-specific fluorescent reporters, permit direct visualization and measurement of peripheral nervous system formation in real time. Additionally, the model is amenable to rapid cellular, molecular, and genetic approaches to determine how developmental mechanisms contribute to disease states, such as cancer. In this chapter, we describe the development of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system (PSNS) in general, and our current understanding of genetic pathways important in zebrafish PSNS development specifically. We also illustrate how zebrafish genetics is used to identify new mechanisms controlling PSNS development and methods for interrogating the potential role of PSNS developmental pathways in neuroblastoma pathogenesis in vivo using the zebrafish MYCN-driven neuroblastoma model.

Abstract: Morphogens were originally defined as secreted signaling molecules that diffuse from local sources to form concentration gradients, which specify multiple cell fates. More recently morphogen gradients have been shown to incorporate a range of mechanisms including short-range signal activation, transcriptional/translational feedback, and temporal windows of target gene induction. Many critical cell–cell signals implicated in both embryonic development and disease, such as Wnt, fibroblast growth factor (Fgf), hedgehog (Hh), transforming growth factor beta (TGFb), and retinoic acid (RA), are thought to act as morphogens, but key information on signal propagation and ligand distribution has been lacking for most. The zebrafish provides unique advantages for genetics and imaging to address gradients during early embryonic stages when morphogens help establish major body axes. This has been particularly informative for RA, where RA response elements (RAREs) driving fluorescent reporters as well as Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) reporters of receptor binding have provided evidence for gradients, as well as regulatory mechanisms that attenuate noise and enhance gradient robustness in vivo. Here we summarize available tools in zebrafish and discuss their utility for studying dynamic regulation of RA morphogen gradients, through combined experimental and computational approaches.

Abstract: Gene therapy for sickle cell disease is currently in active trials. Collecting hematopoietic progenitor cells safely and effectively is challenging, however, because granulocyte colony stimulating factor, the drug used most commonly for mobilization, can cause life-threatening vaso-occlusion in patients with sickle cell disease, and bone marrow harvest requires general anesthesia and multiple hip bone punctures. Plerixafor is an inhibitor of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor on hematopoietic progenitor cells, blocking its binding to SDF-1 (CXCL12) on bone marrow stroma. In support of a clinical trial in patients with sickle cell disease of plerixafor mobilization (NCT02193191), we administered plerixafor to sickle cell mice and found that it mobilizes hematopoietic progenitor cells without evidence of concomitant cell activation or brain vaso-occlusion.

Abstract: Vascular endothelial cells are essential building blocks of angiogenesis, which is required for normal embryonic development and tissue regeneration. In this chapter, we describe how to use transgenic zebrafish embryos expressing vascular-specific green fluorescent protein to evaluate differentiation, growth, and morphogenesis of endothelial cells. When combined with instrument automation and computational analysis, this method allows high-throughput screening for biologically active small chemical molecules that are effective in promoting angiogenesis. These molecules can be validated in mammalian endothelial cell differentiation and proliferation assays. These studies provide new reagents and therapeutic candidates for regenerative medicine studies.

Abstract: Sensory hair-cell development, function, and regeneration are fundamental processes that are challenging to study in mammalian systems. Zebrafish are an excellent alternative model to study hair cells because they have an external auxiliary organ called the lateral line. The hair cells of the lateral line are easily accessible, which makes them suitable for live, function-based fluorescence imaging. In this chapter, we describe methods to perform functional calcium imaging in zebrafish lateral-line hair cells. We compare genetically encoded calcium indicators that have been used previously to measure calcium in lateral-line hair cells. We also outline equipment required for calcium imaging and compare different imaging systems. Lastly, we discuss how to set up optimal imaging parameters and how to process and visualize calcium signals. Overall, using these methods, in vivo calcium imaging is a powerful tool to examine sensory hair-cell function in an intact organism.

Abstract: The Townes mouse model of homozygous sickle cell disease (SS) has emerged as the major experimental model for studying pathophysiological mechanisms of human sickle cell disease (SCD). We therefore investigated hematological and hemorheological parameters as well as organ-specific inflammatory and oxidative stress molecular profiles in these animals in steady state conditions. Evidences of SCD-related intravascular hemolysis, impaired red blood cell (RBC) deformability, leukocytosis and altered plasma nitric oxide byproducts (NOx) level were found in the SS mice. The SS mice have damaged, enlarged and dysfunctional spleen as attested by high AOPP levels, low SOD and GPx activities and low pro-inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression. SS mice exhibited cardiomegaly, high cardiac mRNA levels of proinflammatory markers and low cardiac GPx activity. While lungs did not display any noticeable defects, liver and kidney were particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and inflammation as suggested by high AOPP levels in both organs, elevated renal NF-κB and TNF-α, and increased hepatic VCAM-1 and IL-1β. Our data indicate a tissue-specific phenotype regarding oxidative stress and inflammation in SS mice that may help to optimize the development of novel potential drug treatments.

Abstract: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital erythroid aplasia that usually presents as macrocytic anemia during infancy. Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is identified as the first gene associated with DBA. RPS19 is mutated in 25% of DBA patients, but its role in DBA pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. We have identified a novel heterozygous frameshift mutation in RPS19 gene in a DBA child presenting with profound anemia after birth. A single nucleotide heterozygous deletion (C.251delG) results in frameshift in RPS19 gene in exon 4 at codon 84 with possible premature stop codon (p.Arg84LysfsX21). The mutant allele was not detected in her parents, indicating de novo mutation. Both alleles were expressed at the same level. Using an immunofluorescence technique, the mutated-type RPS19 expressions were mostly localized to entire nuclei with little staining for nucleoli and its intracellular localization significantly differed from the wild-type RPS19, which was localized to both nuclei and nucleoli. This type of a mutation could be very helpful in further understanding the role of the RPS19 protein in DBA pathogenesis.

Abstract: The non-neuronal cholinergic system (NNCS) has been shown to play a role in regulating hematopoietic differentiation. We determined the expression of cholinergic components in leukemic cell lines by Western blotting and in normal leukocyte subsets by flow cytometry and found a heterogeneous expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline transporter (CHT), M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3-mAChR) and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR). We then evaluated NNCS role in differentiation of human NB-4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line and discovered a dramatic induction of M3-mAChR after all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment (p<0.0001). Adding carbachol which is a cholinergic agonist to the ATRA treatment resulted in an increase of a granulocytic differentiation marker (CD11b) as compared with ATRA treatment alone (p<0.05), indicating that cholinergic activation enhanced ATRA in inducing NB-4 maturation. The combination of carbachol and ATRA treatment for 72h also resulted in decreased viability and increased cleaved caspase-3 expression when compared with ATRA treatment alone (p<0.05). However, this combination did not cause poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Overall, we have shown that NB-4 cells expressed M3-mAChR in a differentiation-dependent manner and cholinergic stimulation induced maturation and death of ATRA-induced differentiated NB-4 cells.

Abstract: Peroxisomal matrix protein import is facilitated by cycling receptors that recognize their cargo proteins in the cytosol by peroxisomal targeting sequences (PTS). In the following, the assembled receptor-cargo complex is targeted to the peroxisomal membrane where it docks to the docking-complex as part of the peroxisomal translocation machinery. The docking-complex is composed of Pex13p, Pex14p and in yeast also Pex17p, whose function is still elusive. In order to characterize the function of Pex17p, we compared the composition and size of peroxisomal receptor-docking complexes from wild-type and pex17Δ cells. Our data demonstrate that the deficiency of Pex17p affects the stoichiometry of the constituents of an isolated 600kDa complex and that pex17Δ cells lack a high molecular weight complex (>900kDa) of unknown function. We identified the dynein light chain protein Dyn2p as an additional core component of the Pex14p/Pex17p-complex. Both, Pex14p and Pex17p interact directly with Dyn2p, but in vivo, Pex17p turned out to be prerequisite for an association of Dyn2p with Pex14p. Finally, like pex17Δ also dyn2Δ cells lack the high molecular weight complex. As dyn2Δ cells also display reduced peroxisomal function, our data indicate that Dyn2p-dependent formation of the high molecular weight Pex14p-complex is required to maintain peroxisomal function on wild-type level.

Abstract: Summary
B cells are key components of cellular and humoral immunity and, like all lymphocytes, are thought to originate and renew from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, our recent single-HSC transfer studies demonstrate that adult bone marrow HSCs do not regenerate B-1a, a subset of tissue B cells required for protection against pneumonia, influenza, and other infections. Since B-1a are regenerated by transfers of fetal liver, the question arises as to whether B-1a derive from fetal, but not adult, HSCs. Here we show that, similar to adult HSCs, fetal HSCs selectively fail to regenerate B-1a. We also show that, in humanized mice, human fetal liver regenerates tissue B cells that are phenotypically similar to murine B-1a, raising the question of whether human HSC transplantation, the mainstay of such models, is sufficient to regenerate human B-1a. Thus, our studies overtly challenge the current paradigm that HSCs give rise to all components of the immune system.

Abstract: We describe a strategy for fluorescent imaging of organelle transport in primary hippocampal neurons treated with amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides that cause Alzheimer's disease (AD). This method enables careful, rigorous analyses of axonal transport defects, which are implicated in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we present and emphasize guidelines for investigating Aβ-induced mechanisms of axonal transport disruption in the absence of nonspecific, irreversible cellular toxicity. This approach should be accessible to most laboratories equipped with cell culture facilities and a standard fluorescent microscope and may be adapted to other cell types.

Abstract: The ability to modulate transcription factor activity is critically important for deciphering many cellular and developmental processes. Light is an attractive signal for artificially controlling transcription factor activity because it has high spatial and temporal precision. Several light-switchable technologies have been developed to control gene expression negatively or positively. Although these systems allow spatiotemporal control of transcription, the target gene must be placed downstream of a specific promoter, which is time consuming and applicable to a limited number of genes at the same time. On the other hand, we recently developed a technique for manipulation of transcription factor activity with blue light, termed PixD complex-dependent control (PICCORO) using the bacterial blue-light photoreceptor PixD. This method has the advantage of controlling transcription factor activity at the posttranslational level. Using this method, we were able to control activity of the chimeric dominant-negative transcription factor No tail (Ntl) in zebrafish with blue light. Here we describe the mechanism of PICCORO action and a detailed protocol to apply the technique for controlling other transcription factors.

Abstract: As the processes of embryogenesis become increasingly well understood, there is growing interest in the development that occurs at later, postembryonic stages. Postembryonic development holds tremendous potential for discoveries of both fundamental and translational importance. Zebrafish, which are small, rapidly and externally developing, and which boast a wealth of genetic resources, are an outstanding model of vertebrate postembryonic development. Nonetheless, there are specific challenges posed by working with zebrafish at these stages, and this chapter is meant to serve as a primer for those working with larval and juvenile zebrafish. Since accurate staging is critical for high-quality results and experimental reproducibility, we outline best practices for reporting postembryonic developmental progress. Emphasizing the importance of accurate staging, we present new data showing that rates of growth and size–stage relationships can differ even between wild-type strains. Finally, since rapid and uniform development is particularly critical when working at postembryonic stages, we briefly describe methods that we use to achieve high rates of growth and developmental uniformity through postembryonic stages in both wild-type and growth-compromised zebrafish.

Abstract: In the postgenomic era, the ability to quickly, efficiently, and inexpensively assign function to the zebrafish proteome is critical. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) have revolutionized the ability to perform reverse genetics because of its simplicity and broad applicability. The CRISPR system is composed of an engineered, gene-specific single guide RNA (sgRNA) and a Cas9 enzyme that causes double-stranded breaks in DNA at the targeted site. This simple, two-part system, when injected into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos, efficiently mutates target loci at a frequency such that injected embryos phenocopy known mutant phenotypes. This property allows for CRISPR-based F0 screening in zebrafish, which provides a means to screen through a large number of candidate genes for their role in a phenotype of interest. While there are important considerations for any successful genetic screen, CRISPR screening has significant benefits over conventional methods and can be accomplished in any lab with modest molecular biology experience.

Abstract: Vascular resistance and tissue perfusion may be both affected by impaired vascular function and increased blood viscosity. Little is known about the effects of vascular function on the occurrence of painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) in children with sickle cell anemia (SCA). The aim of the present study was to determine which side of the balance (blood viscosity or vascular function) is the most deleterious in SCA and increases the risk for frequent hospitalized VOC. Microvascular function, microcirculatory oxygenation and blood viscosity were determined in a group of 22 SCA children/adolescents at steady state and a group of 13 healthy children/adolescents. Univariate analyses demonstrated blunted microvascular reactivity during local thermal heating test and decreased microcirculatory oxygenation in SCA children compared to controls. Multivariate analysis revealed that increased blood viscosity and decreased microcirculatory oxygenation were independent risk factors of frequent VOC in SCA. In contrast, the level of microvascular dysfunction does not predict VOC rate. In conclusion, increased blood viscosity is usually well supported in healthy individuals where vascular function is not impaired. However, in the context of SCA, microvascular function is impaired and any increase of blood viscosity or decrease in microcirculatory oxygenation would increase the risks for frequent VOC.

Abstract: Inherited antithrombin (AT) deficiency is a rare autosomal disease that could increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and usually caused by mutations of SERPINC1. Although a number of mutations of SERPINC1 have been reported in Chinese Han population, the impact of different subtypes of these mutations on the thrombotic phenotype is still unknown. Here, we performed a retrospective cohort study including 169 AT patients from 63 families to compare the clinical features between null mutation carriers and missense mutation carriers. We found that patients carrying null mutations have a higher risk of VTE (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.16–4.69, P=0.02 adjusted for sex and VTE family history) and earlier median onset age of VTE (27 vs. 32years, P=0.045) as well as lower AT activities (47.6±1.0% vs. 59.1±2.3%, P<0.001) than those with missense mutations. We also observed that thrombus location sites showed no difference between null mutation carriers and missense mutation carriers, gene locations of the mutations did not relate with the incidence rate of VTE. This study demonstrated that different types of SERPINC1 mutations may play different roles in the development of VTE and should be considered in the prevention of VTE.

Abstract: In a recent work, our group showed the existence of two distinct mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) subsets within human umbilical cord blood. One less proliferative and short-living (SL-CBMSC), the other with higher growth rate and long-living (LL-CBMSC), and therefore better suited for regenerative medicine applications. We examined whether LL-CBMSC possess peculiar paracrine properties able to affect angiogenesis or inflammatory processes. It was shown for the first time that pro-angiogenic, proliferation—stimulating and tissue repairing factors were released at high level not only as soluble cytokines, but also as mRNA precursors embedded in membrane vesicles. The combination of this primary (proteic factors interacting with surface receptors) and delayed (mRNA transferred and translated via vesicle fusion and cargo release) interaction in endothelial target cells resulted in strong blood vessel induction with the development of capillary-like structures. In addition, LL-CBMSC dynamically modulated their release of pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory factors in an in vitro model of damage. In conclusion, LL-CBMSC synthesize and secrete multiple factors that may be attuned in response to the status of the target cell, a crucial requisite when paracrine mechanisms are needed at onset of tissue regeneration.

Abstract: Hemoglobin E is the most common Hb variant found in South East Asia. Variation of Hb F expression in Hb E syndrome is associated with several genetic modifiers. We report several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including nine known and five novel mutations of the Krüppel-like factor 1 (KLF1; an erythroid specific transcription factor) gene and determine their associations with phenotypic expression of Hb F in Hb E disorders. KLF1 mutations were examined using high resolution melting (HRM) assay and DNA sequencing in 575 homozygous Hb E, 278 heterozygous Hb E and 100 normal subjects. Fourteen mutations were mostly observed in subjects with elevated Hb F, including nine known mutations (G176AfsX179, T334R, R238H, −154 (C>T), A298P, S270W, R301H, −148 (G>A) and G335R and five novel mutations (Q217X, Q223X, Y290_S293del, K307N, and M358I). None of them, but the −148 (G>A), were observed in normal controls to have Hb F <1%. Combined KLF1 mutations with other SNPs including Gγ-XmnI, BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB were associated with higher Hb F levels. KLF1 is therefore an important genetic factor associated with increased Hb F and in combination with other modifying factors could explain the phenotypic variation of Hb F expression in this common hemoglobinopathy.

Abstract: Abstract
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital red cell aplasia with mutations in ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Elevated activity of erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) has been utilized as a biomarker of DBA. We examined erythrocyte reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as eADA in 22 patients in 18 DBA families, in whom RP gene mutations had been identified. Simultaneous evaluation of both eADA and GSH demonstrated that all examined DBA patients showed elevated values of either eADA or GSH, whereas presence of both eADA and GSH elevation was able to distinguish DBA patients from 34 normal controls and 14 unaffected members of the DBA families. Furthermore, a support vector machines analysis using both eADA and GSH levels yielded a formula to differentiate DBA from both normal controls and non-DBA family members. To confirm the usefulness of the formula, we analyzed additional 7 patients diagnosed by the clinical criteria. Although eADA showed within normal values in 3 patients, all of these patients were diagnosed as ‘DBA’ by use of the formula. Because extensive analysis of the RP genes failed to detect no causative mutation in approximately 40% of clinically diagnosed DBA patients, GSH may be useful an additional biomarker for diagnosis of DBA.

Abstract: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) interact with other RNAs, DNA and/or proteins to regulate gene expression during development. Erythropoiesis is one developmental process that is tightly controlled throughout life to ensure accurate red blood cell production and oxygen transport to tissues. Thus, homeostasis is critical and maintained by competitive outcomes of pro- and anti-apoptotic pathways. LncRNAs are expressed during blood development; however, specific functions are largely undefined. Here, a culture model of human erythropoiesis revealed that lncRNA Fas-antisense 1 (Fas-AS1 or Saf) was induced during differentiation through the activity of essential erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 and KLF1. Saf was also negatively regulated by NF-κB, where decreasing NF-κB activity levels tracked with increasing transcription of Saf. Furthermore, Saf over-expression in erythroblasts derived from CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells of healthy donors reduced surface levels of Fas and conferred protection against Fas-mediated cell death signals. These studies reveal a novel lncRNA-regulated mechanism that modulates a critical cell death program during human erythropoiesis.

Urokinase and urokinase receptor participate in regulation of neuronal migration, axon growth and branching,

Abstract: Purpose
Recent findings indicate the significant contribution of urokinase and urokinase receptor (uPA and uPAR) in the processes of nerve regeneration, however, their role in axonal growth and branching is unclear. Using a 3D model of mouse Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRG) explants, differentiated into neurons Neuro 2a cells and transgenic mice lacking the urokinase gene, we studied the involvement of the uPA/uPAR system in the neural cell migration, neurite outgrowth, elongation and branching.
Results
uPA and uPAR are expressed in the growth cones of axons. Using an ex vivo model of DRG explants in Matrigel we have found that uPA inhibition attenuates neural cell migration and axonal growth, pointing to an important role of urokinase in these processes. Apparently, uPA mediates its effects through its specific receptor uPAR: anti-uPAR antibody, which blocks the uPA binding to uPAR, stimulates axon branching and attenuates neural cell migration from DRG explants. Simultaneous inhibition of uPA and uPAR almost completely prevents the axonal outgrowth from explants into the Matrigels. Experiments in vitro using Neuro 2a cells differentiated into neurons demonstrate that administration of exogenous uPA increases the neurite growth rate (elongation), most likely via the interaction of uPA with uPAR. Blocking of uPAR stimulates neurite formation and enhances branching of preexisting neurites. The results obtained on DRG explants from transgenic mice lacking uPA gene support the assumption that uPA stimulates neurite growth via uPA/uPAR interaction and uPAR role in axons branching and neural cell migration.
Conclusions
The uPA/uPAR system plays an essential role in neural cell migration, axonal growth and branching.

Abstract: Anti-drug antibodies may develop with biological therapies, possibly leading to a reduction of treatment efficacy and to allergic and other adverse reactions. Patients with Gaucher disease were tested for anti-drug antibodies every 6 or 12weeks in clinical studies of velaglucerase alfa enzyme replacement therapy, as part of a range of safety endpoints. In 10 studies between April 2004 and March 2015, 289 patients aged 2–84years (median 43years) were assessed for the development of anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies. Sixty-four patients were treatment-naïve at baseline and 225 patients were switched to velaglucerase alfa from imiglucerase treatment. They received velaglucerase alfa treatment for a median of 36.4weeks (interquartile range 26.4–155.4weeks). Four patients (1.4%) became positive for anti-velaglucerase alfa IgG antibodies, two of whom had antibodies that were neutralizing in vitro, but there were no apparent changes in patients' platelet counts, hemoglobin levels or levels of CCL18 and chitotriosidase, suggestive of clinical deterioration after anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies were detected, and no infusion-related adverse events were reported. Less than 2% of patients exposed to velaglucerase alfa tested positive for antibodies and there was no apparent correlation between anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies and adverse events or pharmacodynamic or clinical responses.

Abstract: Intracellular transport of proteins and organelles in neurons plays an essential role in nervous system development and maintenance. Axon outgrowth, synapse formation, and synapse function, among other physiological processes, require active transport of these cargos between the neuronal soma and axon terminals. Abnormalities in this axonal transport are associated with a number of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Alzheimer disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite its importance for nervous system development and health, methods for visualizing axonal transport in an intact vertebrate have been lacking. Using the advantages of the zebrafish system, we have developed a straightforward approach to visualize axonal transport of various cargos and motor proteins in intact zebrafish embryos and larvae. Here, we describe this approach in detail and discuss how it can be applied to address questions related to cargo-specific transport regulation and its effects on axon morphology and function in the developing and mature nervous system.

Abstract: Background
No reliable biomarker exists to predict responsiveness to intravenous (IV) iron (Fe) in iron deficient patients with CKD. We aimed to investigate the clinical value of bioactive Hepcidin-25 and soluble Transferrin Receptor (sTfR) levels in predialysis patients.
Patients and methods
In this prospective study 78 stable stage III-IV CKD predialysis patients with (responders) (40 patients) and without (non-responders) (38 patients) adequate erythropoiesis after IV administration of ferric-carboxymaltose (FCM). Patients were divided in two groups according to their response to IV administration of ferric-carboxymaltose (FCM). Along with measurements of common hematologic and blood chemistry parameters, determinations of sTfR and bioactive Hepcidin-25 were performed. Results: Hepcidin-25 levels were lower in the responders (p=0.025), while sTfR and sTfR/Hepcidin-25 ratio were higher (p<0.01 and p=0.002 respectively). Diagnostic efficacy indicated cut off point of 1.49 for Hepcidin-25 had sensitivity 84% and specificity 48%, while cut off point of 1.21 for sTfR/Hepcidin-25 ratio had sensitivity 82% and specificity 52% to predict correctly response to iron supplementation therapy. Furthermore, log sTfR/Hepcidin-25 correlated negatively with hs-CRP (p=0.005) and IL-6 (p<0.04) in non-responders, while such correlations were not found in responders (p>0.05).
Conclusions
These results suggest that lower Hepcidin-25, as well as higher sTfR and sTfR/Hepcidin-25 ratio were significant predictors of favorable hemoglobin response within a month after IV administration of FCM in patients with CKD. Further experiments and clinical studies in other groups of patients are needed to better elucidate the role of Hepcidin-25 and sTfR/Hepcidin-25 ratio as predictors of response to intravenous iron administration.

Abstract: Individual septins from separate phylogenetic groups assemble into heteropolymer rods with defined compositions. Heteropolymer rods can in turn assemble into larger higher-order structures (HOS). Using a combination of immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy in Aspergillus nidulans wild-type and septin-mutant strains, we have shown that even when septin HOS are not visible by fluorescence microscopy, heteropolymer rods can still be present and that a septin found largely in filamentous fungi is required for a subset of HOS. We raise several factors that are important for analysis of heteropolymer rods and HOS.

Abstract: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a common genetic abnormality known to predispose to acute hemolytic anemia (AHA), which can be triggered by certain drugs or infection. However, the commonest trigger is fava beans (Vicia faba) ingestion, causing AHA (favism), which may be life-threatening especially in children. G6PD deficiency is genetically highly heterogeneous, as nearly 200 different mutations have been observed. We have investigated the hematological features of acute favism in the Palestinian Gaza community that is characterized by the polymorphic coexistence of three different G6PD deficiency genes (G6PD A−, G6PD Cairo, G6PD Med). We have found by comparison to the general population (485 adults and 466 newborns) that children with favism, in terms of relative frequency, G6PD A− was under-represented, whereas G6PD Med was over-represented. We also found that the severity of anemia was significantly greater with G6PD Med and G6PD Cairo than with G6PD A−; and with G6PD Cairo, compared to the other two variants, there was greater hyperbilirubinemia, as well as persistence of mild anemia and reticulocytosis for as long as 4months after recovery from favism. This is the first report determining a differential impact of different G6PD mutations on the clinical features of favism in the same population and the same environment.

Abstract: From a fixed number of genes carried in all cells, organisms create considerable diversity in cellular phenotype through differential regulation of gene expression. One prevalent source of transcriptome diversity is alternative pre-mRNA splicing, which is manifested in many different forms. Zebrafish models of splicing dysfunction due to mutated spliceosome components provide opportunity to link biochemical analyses of spliceosome structure and function with whole organism phenotypic outcomes. Drawing from experience with two zebrafish mutants: cephalophŏnus (a prpf8 mutant, isolated for defects in granulopoiesis) and caliban (a rnpc3 mutant, isolated for defects in digestive organ development), we describe the use of glycerol gradient sedimentation and native gel electrophoresis to resolve components of aberrant splicing complexes. We also describe how RNAseq can be employed to examine relatively rare alternative splicing events including intron retention. Such experimental approaches in zebrafish can promote understanding of how splicing variation and dysfunction contribute to phenotypic diversity and disease pathogenesis.

Abstract: The functioning of GPCRs is classically described by the ternary complex model as the interplay of three basic components: a receptor, an agonist, and a G protein. According to this model, receptor activation results from an interaction with an agonist, which translates into the activation of a particular G protein in the intracellular compartment that, in turn, is able to initiate particular signaling cascades. Extensive studies on GPCRs have led to new findings which open unexplored and exciting possibilities for drug design and safer and more effective treatments with GPCR targeting drugs. These include discovery of novel signaling mechanisms such as ligand promiscuity resulting in multitarget ligands and signaling cross-talks, allosteric modulation, biased agonism, and formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and oligomers which can be efficiently studied with computational methods. Computer-aided drug design techniques can reduce the cost of drug development by up to 50%. In particular structure- and ligand-based virtual screening techniques are a valuable tool for identifying new leads and have been shown to be especially efficient for GPCRs in comparison to water-soluble proteins. Modern computer-aided approaches can be helpful for the discovery of compounds with designed affinity profiles. Furthermore, homology modeling facilitated by a growing number of available templates as well as molecular docking supported by sophisticated techniques of molecular dynamics and quantitative structure–activity relationship models are an excellent source of information about drug–receptor interactions at the molecular level.

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α)-regulated expression of Hexokinase-II (HKII) remains a cornerstone in the maintenance of high metabolic demands subserving various pro-tumor functions including immune evasion in gliomas. Since inflammation-induced HIF-1α regulates Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) gene expression, and as cytoskeletal dynamics affect MHC-I membrane clusters, we investigated the involvement of HIF-1α-HKII axis in Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNFα)-mediated MHC-I membrane cluster stability in glioma cells and the involvement of actin cytoskeleton in the process. TNFα increased the clustering and colocalization of MHC-I with cortical actin in a HIF-1α dependent manner. siRNA mediated knockdown of HIF-1α as well as enzymatic inhibition of HK II by Lonidamine, delocalized mitochondrially bound HKII. This altered subcellular HKII localization affected TNFα-induced cofilin activation and actin turnover, as pharmacological inhibition of HKII by Lonidamine decreased Actin-related protein 2 (ARP2)/cofilin interaction. Photobleaching studies revealed destabilization of TNFα- induced stable MHC-I membrane clusters in the presence of Lonidamine and ARP2 inhibitor CK666. This work highlights how TNFα triggers a previously unknown function of metabolic protein HKII to influence an immune related outcome. Our study establishes the importance of inflammation induced HIF-1α in integrating two crucial components- the metabolic and immune, through reorganization of cytoskeleton.

Abstract: Pain is a hallmark feature of sickle cell disease (SCD). Subjects typically quantify pain by themselves, which can be biased by other factors leading to overtreatment or under-treatment. Reliable and accurate quantification of pain, in real time, might enable to provide appropriate levels of analgesic treatment. The mouse grimace scale (MGS), a standardized behavioral coding system with high accuracy and reliability has been used to quantify varied types of pain. We hypothesized that addition of the objective parameters of body length and back curvature will strengthen the reproducibility of MGS. We examined MGS scores and body length and back curvature of transgenic BERK sickle and control mice following cold treatment or following treatment with analgesic cannabinoid CP55,940. We observed that sickle mice demonstrated decreased length and increased back curvature in response to cold. These observations correlate with changes in facial expression for the MGS score. CP55,940 treatment of sickle mice showed an increase in body length and a decrease in back curvature concordant with MGS scores indicative of an analgesic effect. Thus, body parameters combined with facial expressions may provide a quantifiable unbiased method for objective measure of pain in SCD.

Abstract: Accumulating evidence suggests the potential for radiation therapy to generate antitumor immune responses against tumor cells by inducing immunogenic cell death and phenotypic changes. We recently found that ionizing radiation upregulated karyopherin α2 (KPNA2) in HT-29 colorectal tumor cells using quantitative proteomic analysis. To determine whether this increased KPNA2 could function as a damage-associated molecular pattern to induce antitumor immune responses, mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were treated with KPNA2. KPNA2 enhanced the surface expression of CD40, CD54, CD80, CD86, and MHC class I/II on BMDCs. DCs treated with KPNA2 exhibited increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and TNF-α. Co-culture of CD4+ T cells and KPNA2-treated DCs resulted in induction of Th1/17 cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-17) and reduction of TGF-β production. Moreover, KPNA2-treated DCs were capable of increasing granzyme B and perforin expression in cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These results demonstrated that radiation-induced dying colorectal cancer cells released considerable amounts of KPNA2 that induce the maturation and activation of DCs for synergistic antitumor effect of radiation.

Abstract: A recent study suggested that adenosine signaling pathway could promote hemolysis in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). This signaling pathway involves several gene coding enzymes for which variants have been described. In this study, we analyzed the genotype–phenotype relationships between functional polymorphisms or polymorphisms associated with altered expression of adenosine pathway genes, namely adenosine deaminase (ada; rs73598374), adenosine A2b receptor (adora2b; rs7208480), adenylyl cyclase6 (adcy6; rs3730071, rs3730070, rs7300155), and hemolytic rate in SCA patients. One hundred and fifty SCA patients were genotyped for adcy6, ada, and adora2b variants as well as alpha-globin gene, a genetic factor known to modulate hemolytic rate. Hematological and biochemical data were obtained at steady-state. Lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, reticulocytes and total bilirubin were used to calculate a hemolytic index. Genotype–phenotype relationships were investigated using parametric tests and multivariate analysis. SCA patients carrying at least one allele of adcy6 rs3730070-G exhibited lower hemolytic rate than non-carriers in univariate analysis (p=0.006). The presence of adcy6 rs3730070-G variant was associated with a decreased hemolytic rate in adjusted model for age and alpha-thalassemia (p=0.032). Our results support a protective effect of adcy6 rs3730070-G variant on hemolysis in SCA patients.

Abstract: Background and aims
We have previously demonstrated that islet stellate cells (ISCs) exhibiting a similar phenotype to classical pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) could be isolated from rat islets, where they may contribute to islet fibrosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study was designed to determine whether human islets also contain ISC.
Materials and methods
Using standard explants techniques, human ISCs were enriched from freshly isolated human islets. Immunofluorescence visualization of markers for PSCs(α-smooth muscle actin;α-SMA), desmin, vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was used to characterize the human ISC. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to assess the proliferation of ISC. The wound-healing assay and the transwell migration were used to assess the migration capacity of ISC. Immunofluorescence against collagen typesI (col-I), collagen typesIII (col-III) and fibronectin (FN) was performed to identify extracellular matrix (ECM) component synthesized by ISC. Adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation were tried to detected stem cell potential.
Results
In culture, ISC with triangular shape grow out from human islets. The passaged ISC expressed α-SMA, desmin, vimentin, GFAP and was positive for col-I, col-III and FN. The proliferation and migration ability of ISC was significantly slower than those of PSC. And both the human PSC and ISC were able to differentiate in vitro into adipocyte- and osteoblast-like cells.
Conclusion
Similar to our previous rat experiment, the current study shows that human islets also contain ISC which is phenotypically similar but not identical to human PSC.

Abstract: Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrosis is a widely studied animal model of human idiopathic nephrotic syndrome because PAN injection into rats results in increased glomerular permeability with the characteristic ultrastructural changes in podocytes similar to human nephrosis. To investigate the role of zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and oxidative stress on PAN-induced podocyte phenotypical changes and hyperpermeability in vitro, we cultured rat and mouse podocytes and treated with various concentrations of PAN. PAN treatment increased oxidative stress level of podocytes significantly with the induction of Nox4. In addition, PAN changed the ultrastructure of podocytes, such as shortening and fusion of microvilli, and the separation of intercellular gaps, which were improved by anti-oxidative vitamin C and Nox4 siRNA. PAN also disrupted the intercellular linear ZO-1 staining and induced inner cytoplasmic re-localization of ZO-1 protein, resulting in increased podocyte intercellular permeability. PAN reduced ZO-1 protein amount and mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner, which means that PAN could also modulate ZO-1 protein transcriptionally. However, the decreased ZO-1 protein of podocytes by PAN was improved by Nox4 siRNA transfection. Furthermore, vitamin C mitigated the quantitative and distributional disturbances of ZO-1 protein caused by PAN. Our results demonstrate that the phenotypical changes of intercellular ZO-1 by oxidative stress via Nox4 likely contribute to the glomerular hyperpermeability caused by PAN.

Abstract: Cytoskeleton-dependent RNA transport and local translation in axons are gaining increased attention as key processes in the maintenance and functioning of neurons. Specific axonal transcripts have been found to play roles in many aspects of axonal physiology including axon guidance, axon survival, axon to soma communication, injury response and regeneration. This axonal transcriptome requires long-range transport that is achieved by motor proteins carrying transcripts as messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes along microtubules. Other than transport, the mRNP complex plays a major role in the generation, maintenance, and regulation of the axonal transcriptome. Identification of axonal RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and analyses of the dynamics of their mRNPs are of high interest to the field. Here, we describe methods for the study of interactions between RNA and proteins in axons. First, we describe a protocol for identifying binding proteins for an RNA of interest by using RNA affinity chromatography. Subsequently, we discuss immunoprecipitation (IP) methods allowing the dissection of protein–RNA and protein–protein interactions in mRNPs under various physiological conditions.

Abstract: Coronin 1C is an established modulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. It has been shown to be involved in protrusion formation, cell migration and invasion. Here, we report the generation of primary fibroblasts from coronin 1C knock-out mice in order to investigate the impact of the loss of coronin 1C on cellular structural organisation. We demonstrate that the lack of coronin 1C not only affects the actin system, but also the microtubule and the vimentin intermediate filament networks. In particular, we show that the knock-out cells exhibit a reduced proliferation rate, impaired cell migration and protrusion formation as well as an aberrant subcellular localisation and function of mitochondria. Moreover, we demonstrate that coronin 1C specifically interacts with the non-α-helical amino-terminal domain (“head”) of vimentin. Our data suggest that coronin 1C acts as a cytoskeletal integrator of actin filaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments.

Abstract: Autophagy is an ancient cellular pathway that is conserved from yeast to man. It contributes to many physiological and pathological processes and plays a major role in the degradation of proteins and/or organelles in response to starvation and stress. In the autophagic process cytosolic material is captured into double membrane-bound vesicles, the autophagosomes. After fusion with lysosomes, the cargo is degraded in the generated autolysosomes and then recycled for further use. Autophagy 8 (ATG8, in mammals LC3), a well-established marker of autophagy, is covalently linked to phosphatidylethanolamine on the autophagic membrane during autophagosome formation. Bioinformatic analysis of the Dictyostelium genome revealed two atg8 genes which encode the ATG8a and ATG8b paralogs. They are with around 14kDa similar in size, 54 % identical to one another and more closely related to the corresponding proteins in fungi and plants than in animals. For ATG8a we found a strong up-regulation throughout the 24h developmental time course while ATG8b expression was highest in vegetative cells followed by a moderate reduction during early development. Confocal microscopy of fluorescently tagged ATG8a and ATG8b in vegetative AX2 wild-type and in ATG9− cells showed that both proteins mainly co-localized on vesicular structures with a diameter above 500nm while those smaller than 500nm were predominantly positive for ATG8b. In ATG9− cells we found a strong increase in the relative abundance of ATG8a-positive large vesicular structures and of total ATG8b-positive structures per cell indicating autophagic flux problems in this mutant. We also found that vesicular structures positive for ATG8a and/or ATG8b were also positive for ubiquitin. Live cell imaging of AX2 and ATG9− cells co-expressing combinations of red and green tagged ATG8a, ATG8b or ATG9 revealed transient co localizations of these proteins. Our results suggest that ATG8b associates with nascent autophagosomes before ATG8a. We further find that the process of autophagosome formation in Dictyostelium is highly dynamic. We infer from our data that Dictyostelium ATG8a and ATG8b have distinct functions in autophagosome formation and that ATG8b is the functional orthologue of the mammalian LC3 subfamily and ATG8a of the GABARAP subfamily.

Abstract: Heatstroke is a serious illness in dogs characterized by core temperatures above 41°C with central nervous system dysfunction. Experimental heatstroke models have tried to correlate biomarker levels with the severity of the syndrome. Serum heat shock protein (eHSP70) levels were recently evaluated as a biomarker of heat tolerance and acclimation, their role as a marker of heatstroke is inconclusive. Here, we monitored eHSP70 levels in correlation with systemic biomarkers in 30 naturally occurring canine heatstroke cases. Thirty dogs diagnosed with environmental (33 %) or exertional (66 %) heatstroke admitted to hospital (0–14 h post-injury) were tested for biomarkers of organ damage and coagulation parameters. eHSP70 levels were measured upon admission and 4, 12, and 24 h later (T1, T2, and T3, respectively). No differences were found between exertional and environmental heatstroke cases. The eHSP profile demonstrated an inverted bell shape, with the lowest levels at the 12 h time point. A positive correlation between eHSP70, lactate, and aPPT was also noted at T2 in all the dogs in the study. Twenty-four h after presentation, eHSP70 levels returned to those measured upon admission, this change was only significant in the survivors. The obtained results suggest that eHSP72 level profile may be predictive of survival.

Abstract: Modern optical imaging has progressed rapidly with the ability to noninvasively image cellular and subcellular phenomena with high spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, emerging techniques such as second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy can allow for the monitoring of intrinsic contrast, such as that from collagen, in live and fixed samples. When coupled with multiphoton fluorescence microscopy, SHG can be used to image interactions between cells and the surrounding extracellular environment. There is recent interest in using these approaches to study inflammation and wound healing in zebrafish, an important model for studying these processes. In this chapter we present the practical aspects of using second harmonic generation to image interactions between leukocytes and collagen during wound healing in zebrafish.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Pharmacologic augmentation of γ-globin expression sufficient to reduce anemia and clinical severity in patients with diverse hemoglobinopathies has been challenging. In studies here, representative molecules from four chemical classes, representing several distinct primary mechanisms of action, were investigated for effects on γ-globin transcriptional repressors, including components of the NuRD complex (LSD1 and HDACs 2–3), and the downstream repressor BCL11A, in erythroid progenitors from hemoglobinopathy patients. Two HDAC inhibitors (MS-275 and SB939), a short-chain fatty acid derivative (sodium dimethylbutyrate [SDMB]), and an agent identified in high-throughput screening, Benserazide, were studied. These therapeutics induced γ-globin mRNA in progenitors above same subject controls up to 20-fold, and increased F-reticulocytes up to 20%. Cellular protein levels of BCL11A, LSD-1, and KLF1 were suppressed by the compounds. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated a 3.6-fold reduction in LSD1 and HDAC3 occupancy in the γ-globin gene promoter with Benserazide exposure, 3-fold reduction in LSD-1 and HDAC2 occupancy in the γ-globin gene promoter with SDMB exposure, while markers of gene activation (histone H3K9 acetylation and H3K4 demethylation), were enriched 5.7-fold. These findings identify clinical-stage oral therapeutics which inhibit or displace major co-repressors of γ-globin gene transcription and may suggest a rationale for combination therapy to produce enhanced efficacy.

Abstract: Hyaluronan (HA) is a glycosamminoglican involved in cell biology as well as a relevant polymer for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Megakaryocytes (Mks) are immersed in a mesh of extracellular matrix (ECM) components that regulate their maturation in the bone marrow (BM) and the release of platelets into the bloodstream. While fibrous ECMs such as collagens and fibronectin have been demonstrated to differently regulate Mk function and platelet release, the role of HA, that fills the majority of the BM extracellular interstitial space, has not been investigated so far. Here we demonstrated that, although human Mks express HA receptors, they are not affected by HA in terms of in vitro differentiation, maturation and platelet formation. Importantly, chemical properties of HA were exploited to generate hydrogels with entrapped ECMs that represent a useful model to more closely mimic the tridimensional characteristics of the BM environment for studying Mk function. In conclusion, in this work we demonstrated that HA is an ideal candidate for a 3D ex vivo model of human BM ECM component environment.

Abstract: In the last few years the development of CRISPR/Cas 9-mediated genome editing techniques has allowed the efficient generation of loss-of-function alleles in several model organisms including zebrafish. However, these methods are mainly devoted to target-specific genomic loci leading to the creation of constitutive knock-out models. On the contrary, the analysis of gene function via tissue- or cell-specific mutagenesis remains challenging in zebrafish. To circumvent this limitation, we present here a simple and versatile protocol to achieve tissue-specific gene disruption based on the Cas9 expression under the control of the Gal4/upstream activating sequence binary system. In our method, we couple Cas9 with green fluorescent protein or Cre reporter gene expression. This strategy allows us to induce somatic mutations in genetically labeled cell clones or single cells, and to follow them in vivo via reporter gene expression. Importantly, because none of the tools that we present here are restricted to zebrafish, similar approaches are readily applicable in virtually any organism where transgenesis and DNA injection are feasible.

Abstract: The formation and maintenance of highly polarized neurons critically depends on the proper organization of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton. In axons, MTs are uniformly oriented with their plus-end pointing outward whereas in mature dendrites MTs have mixed orientations. MT organization and dynamics can be regulated by MT-associated proteins (MAPs). Plus-end tracking proteins are specialized MAPs that decorate plus-ends of growing MTs and regulate neuronal polarity, neurite extension, and dendritic spine morphology. Conventional fluorescence microscopy enables observation of specific cellular components through molecule-specific labeling but provides limited resolution (∼250nm). Therefore, electron microscopy has until now provided most of our knowledge about the precise MT organization in neurons. In the past decade, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques have emerged that circumvent the diffraction limit of light and enable high-resolution reconstruction of the MT network combined with selective protein labeling. However, preserving MT ultrastructure, MAP binding, high labeling density, and antibody specificity after fixation protocols is still quite challenging. In this chapter, we provide an optimized protocol for two-color direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy imaging of neuronal MTs together with their growing plus-ends to probe MT architecture and polarity.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are widely known to modulate almost all physiological functions and have been demonstrated over the time as therapeutic targets for wide gamut of diseases. The design and implementation of high-throughput GPCR-based assays that permit the efficient screening of large compound libraries to discover novel drug candidates are essential for a successful drug discovery endeavor. Usually, GPCR-based functional assays depend primarily on the measurement of G protein-mediated second messenger generation. However, with advent of advanced molecular biology tools and increased understanding of GPCR signal transduction, many G protein-independent pathways such as β-arrestin translocation are being utilized to detect the activity of GPCRs. These assays provide additional information on functional selectivity (also known as biased agonism) of compounds that could be harnessed to develop pathway-selective drug candidates to reduce the adverse effects associated with given GPCR target. In this chapter, we describe the basic principle, detailed methodologies and assay setup, result analysis and data interpretations of the β-arrestin2 Tango assay, and its comparison with cell-based G protein-dependent GPCR assays, which could be employed in a simple academic setup to facilitate GPCR-based drug discovery.

Abstract: The classical chromosome Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of disorders that share clinical, hematological, and histological features. Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are elevated in patients with MPN. The aim of this study was to verify the association between the polymorphisms of TNF gene (-308G/A and -238 G/A) in BCR-ABL-negative MPN in our population. Blood samples obtained from MPN patients were genotyped for the JAK2V617F mutation and both TNF polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP. Thirty three (26.8%) patients with polycythemia vera (PV), 35 (28.7%) essential thrombocythemia (ET), 22 (17.7%) primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and 33 (26.8%) with unclassifiable MPN (MPNu) were included in the study. The JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 94 (76.42%) patients. Were observed a significant increase on the frequency of the TNF-238 GA genotype in MPN patients compared to controls (OR=2.21, 95% CI=1.02–4.80, P<0.04). The distribution of the genotypes and allelic frequencies of TNF-308 was significantly different among the MPNs, JAK2V617F positive, PV and PMF, and controls. Our data has demonstrated that the polymorphisms on TNF-238 GA, TNF-308 GA were associated to MPN development in this population, triggered by JAK2 V617F mutation.

Abstract: Congenital factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency, the most under diagnosed disorder is caused mainly due to underlying defects in the catalytic A subunit of FXIII. More than 100 mutations throughout the factor XIII A gene (F13A1) have been identified so far. Present study aims to characterize the molecular basis of severe congenital FXIII deficiency in a large series of patients from different parts of India. F13A1 defects were identified in 37 severe FXIII deficient unrelated Indian patients by direct DNA sequencing. 25 mutations were detected, of which 10 were missense, 9 nonsense, 3 splice site and 3 deletions; 14 were novel. This is the largest series of FXIII deficient cases reported from India in which mutations were analysed with high heterogeneity in the nature of mutations along with several common mutations.

Abstract: Background
Antithrombin [AT]-, protein C [PC]- or protein S [PS]-deficiency [D] constitutes a major risk factor for venous thromboembolism [VTE]. Primary study objective was to evaluate if the clinical presentation at first VTE onset differs between children and adults and to compare the individual recurrence risk among patients with respect to age at onset and their thrombophilia status ATD, PCD or PSD.
Methods/Patients/Results
In 137 of 688 consecutively enrolled pediatric and adult VTE patients we calculated the absolute risk of VTE recurrence and event-free-survival adjusted for thrombophilia and positive family VTE history. At first VTE children manifested i) with a lower rate of pulmonary embolism, ii) a higher rate of cerebral vascular events or multiple VTEs, and iii) showed a higher proportion of unprovoked VTE compared to adolescents and adults. Adult patients reported more often a positive VTE history compared to younger study participants. The adjusted odds of recurrence in adults was 2.05 compared to children.
Conclusion
At disease manifestation children and adults differ with respect to i) thrombotic locations, ii) percentage of unprovoked versus provoked VTE, and iii) different rates of positive VTE family histories. Furthermore, adults showed a two-fold increase risk of VTE recurrence compared to children.

Abstract: Objective
To document immune reconstitution status after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for malignant hematologic diseases.
Methods
Hematology patients who received a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) were followed after successful allogeneic or autologous HSCT. Patients had at least 100days post-transplant. T, B and NK cells in peripheral blood (PB), and CD34+, CD133+ progenitor cells in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) were determined by flow cytometry.
Results
Twenty-seven HSCT recipients, 19 allogeneic and 8 autologous, were studied at a median 155 (100–721) days post-transplant. In the whole group the median value of CD34+ cells was 1.03% in the bone marrow and 0.04% in PB, whereas values for CD133+ cells were 0.39% and 0.13%, respectively, without statistical differences between autologous and allogeneic recipients. Significantly more B cells (CD3−/CD56−/CD19+) were found in the autologous compared to the allogeneic group, 12.6 vs. 5.01, p=0.04. An increased number of CD8+ lymphocytes with a 0.63 CD4:CD8 relationship was documented in PB.
Conclusion
In clinically recovered autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients BM and PB CD34+/CD133+ hematoprogenitor homeostasis is maintained within normal ranges, with better B-cell reconstitution in the autologous group.

Abstract: The mitosome is a double-membrane enveloped organelle that is found in few unicellular eukaryotes, one of which is the human intestinal parasitic protist Giardia intestinalis, which also lacks mitochondria and peroxisomes. This flagellated protist grows in vitro as trophozoites and under some conditions, differentiates into cysts, which are characterized by the absence of externalized flagella, a round shape, and the presence of a cyst wall. The presence and distribution of mitosomal proteins, such as giardial iron-sulfur cluster protein (GiIscU), heat-shock protein 70 (mit-HSP70) and giardial chaperonin 60 (GiCpn60), during the process of trophozoite-to-cyst transformation was tracked using confocal laser scanning microscopy and western blotting. During the early stages of the differentiation process (∼12h), there was a significant decrease in the extent of chaperone labeling in the cells, which disappeared after 21h but was recovered during the cyst stage; IscU labeling remained present throughout the differentiation process. This finding was confirmed by mRNA expression analysis, thus indicating that a process modulates the expression of mitosomal chaperones during the G. intestinalis life cycle. Microscopy techniques, such as structured illumination and electron tomography, revealed a novel profile for central mitosomes, as well as the presence of both rounded and elongated mitosomes.

Abstract: Podocalyxin (Podxl) has an essential role in the development and function of the kidney glomerular filtration barrier. It is also expressed by vascular endothelia but perinatal lethality of podxl−/− mice has precluded understanding of its function in adult vascular endothelial cells (ECs). In this work, we show that conditional knockout mice with deletion of Podxl restricted to the vascular endothelium grow normally but most die spontaneously around three months of age. Histological analysis showed a nonspecific inflammatory infiltrate within the vessel wall frequently associated with degenerative changes, and involving vessels of different caliber in one or more organs. Podxl-deficient lung EC cultures exhibit increased permeability to dextran and macrophage transmigration. After thrombin stimulation, ECs lacking Podxl showed delayed recovery of VE-cadherin cell contacts, persistence of F-actin stress fibers, and sustained phosphorylation of the ERM complex and activation of RhoA, suggesting a failure in endothelial barrier stabilization. The results suggest that Podxl has an essential role in the regulation of endothelial permeability by influencing the mechanisms involved in the restoration of endothelial barrier integrity after injury.

Abstract: Imatinib (IM) resistant Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is an important issue to be addressed while treating CML patients. The present study analyzes the role of EphB4-VAV1 signaling in IM-resistant CML. EphB4 and VAV1 were overexpressed in IM-resistant CML patients and K562-R cell line (K562-R). Then, we established stable under-expressing EphB4 cell line K562-R-EphB4-sh. VAV1 was down-regulated in K562-R-EphB4-sh cells. K562-R-EphB4-sh cells gained re-sensitivity to IM and K562-R cells showed mild IM resistance. However, EphB4 was no changed when the VAV1 was down-regulated. EphB4 and VAV1 were overexpressed in IM-resistant CML, VAV1might be the downstream moleculars of EphB4. These results suggest a potential role of EphB4-VAV1 signaling as therapeutic target of IM-resistant CML.

Abstract: Congenital factor XI (FXI) deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder with unpredictable bleeding tendency. Few studies in a large cohort have been reported regarding associations between FXI activity (FXI:C) or genotypes and bleeding symptoms currently. This study characterized clinical manifestations and mutation spectrum of 57 subjects with FXI deficiency in China. Clinical data were collected and mutations were identified by direct sequencing and determined by mRNA analysis. The result revealed bleeding symptoms were only found in 12 patients (12/57, 21.1%) with severely reduced FXI:C, and prolonged bleeding post injury/surgery as well as easy bruising were the commonest bleeding manifestations presented in respective 5 cases (5/12, 41.7%). A total number of 37 mutations were identified including 19 missense mutations, 9 nonsense mutations, 6 splice site mutations and 3 small deletions. Among them, 4 missense mutations, 5 splice mutations, 3 small deletions and a nonsense mutation were newly detected. W228*, G400V, Q263* and c.1136-4delGTTG with a total frequency of 48.3% were the most four common mutations in Chinese patients. RT-PCR analysis was carried out and confirmed that both c.596-8T>A and c.1136-4delGTTG were pathogenic due to frameshift resulting in respective truncated proteins. Our findings suggested clinical manifestations had little to do with FXI:C or genotypes, which required further study. This study, the largest investigation of FXI deficiency in China revealed that the F11 mutation spectrum of Chinese population was distinct from those of other populations earlier established.

Abstract: In Gaucher disease (GD) imaging of liver and spleen is part of routine follow-up of GD patients. Focal lesions in both liver and spleen are frequently reported at radiological examinations. These lesions often represent benign accumulations of Gaucher cells, so-called “gaucheroma”, but malignancies, especially hepatocellular carcinoma, are more frequently found in GD as well. We report the imaging characteristics of all focal lesions in liver and spleen in the Dutch GD cohort. Of the 95 GD1 patients, 40% had focal splenic and/or hepatic lesions, associated with more severe GD. Lesions identified as gaucheroma have variable imaging characteristics: hyper- to hypointense on MRI, hyper- or hypoechoic on US and hypodense on computed tomography (CT). Hepatic lesions were classified as simple cysts or haemangioma based upon imaging characteristics. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), gaucheroma and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) could not be distinguished by conventional US, CT or MRI. Growth of these lesions and/or characteristics of HCC on dynamic CT or MRI and pathology was used to identify or rule out HCC. We propose a decision-making algorithm including the use of growth and dynamic CT- or MRI-scanning to characterize lesions.

Abstract: Hemostasis is a coordinated system through which blood is prevented from exiting a closed circulatory system. We have taken advantage of the zebrafish, an emerging model for the study of blood coagulation, and describe three techniques for quantitative analysis of primary and secondary hemostasis. Collectively, these three techniques comprise a toolset to aid in our understanding of hemostasis and pathological clotting.

Abstract: The effect of estrogen receptors on diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction is critical, but ambiguous. Individuals with diabetic vascular disease may require estrogen receptor-specific targeted therapy in the future. The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has beneficial effects on vascular function. However, its fundamental mechanisms are unclear. The RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway contributes to diabetic vascular complications, whereas estrogen can suppress Rho-kinase function. Thus, we assumed that GPER inhibits diabetes-mediated RhoA activation to prevent vascular dysfunction. We further investigated the underlying mechanisms involved in this process. Vascular endothelial cells and ex vivo cultured ovariectomized (OVX) C57BL/6 mouse aortae were treated with high glucose (HG) alone or in combination with GPER agonist (G1). G1 treatment was also administered to OVX db/db mice for 8 weeks. An ex-vivo isovolumic myograph was used to analyze the endothelium-dependent vasodilation and endothelium-independent contraction of mouse aortae. Apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation were attenuated in G1-pretreated vascular endothelial cells. G1 significantly decreased the phosphorylation of inhibitory endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase residue threonine 495 (eNOS Thr495), inhibited RhoA expression, and increased NO production. Additionally, G1 rescued the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation and inhibited RhoA activation in the thoracic aorta of OVX db/db mice and ex-vivo cultured OVX C57BL/6 mouse aortae treated with HG. Estrogens acting via GPER could protect vascular endothelium, and GPER activation might elicit ERα-independent effect to inhibit RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway. Additionally, GPER activation might reduce vascular smooth muscle contraction by inhibiting RhoA activation. Thus, the results of the present study suggest a new therapeutic paradigm for end-stage vascular dysfunction by inhibiting RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway via GPER activation.

Abstract: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are heterogeneous clonal haematopoeitic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective haematopoeisis, cytopenias and risk of progression to AML. We studied 150 MDS patients for cytogenetic aberrations and 60 patients with normal karyotype and 40 patients harboring cytogenetic abnormalities for copy number variations (CNVs). Cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 46% of patients with a majority of patients harboring abnormalities of chromosome 7 and del (20q) at frequencies of 16% and 12% respectively. We explored the potential of quantitative multiplex PCR assay of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF) to identify CNVs and correlated the findings with cytogenetic data and disease prognosis. CNVs (n=31) were detected in 28.3% of karyotypically normal and 23% patients with abnormal karyotype. Genetic losses or deletions (n=26) were more frequent than duplications (n=5). EPO (7q22) and SEC-61(7p11) emerged as new candidate genes susceptible to genetic losses with 57.7% deletions identified in regions on chromosome 7. The CNVs correlated with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) intermediate disease risk group. Our integrative cytogenetic and copy number variation study suggests that abnormalities of chromosome 7 are predominant in Indian population and that they may play a secondary role in disease progression and should be evaluated further for asserting their clinical significance and influence on disease prognosis.

Abstract: Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) are heterogeneous red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders that result from mutations in the genes encoding α-spectrin (SPTA1), β-spectrin (SPTB), or protein 4.1R (EPB41). The resulting defects alter the horizontal cytoskeletal associations and affect RBC membrane stability and deformability causing shortened RBC survival. The clinical diagnosis of HE and HPP relies on identifying characteristic RBC morphology on peripheral blood smear and specific membrane biomechanical properties using osmotic gradient ektacytometry. However, this phenotypic diagnosis may not be readily available in patients requiring frequent transfusions, and does not predict disease course or severity. Using Next-Generation sequencing, we identified the causative genetic mutations in fifteen patients with clinically suspected HE or HPP and correlated the identified mutations with the clinical phenotype and ektacytometry profile. In addition to identifying three novel mutations, gene sequencing confirmed and, when the RBC morphology was not evaluable, identified the diagnosis. Moreover, genotypic differences justified the phenotypic differences within families with HE/HPP.

Abstract: The ZFP36 family of zinc finger proteins, including ZFP36, ZFP36L1, and ZFP36L2, regulates the production of growth factors and cytokines via destabilization of the respective mRNAs. We could recently demonstrate that in cultured keratinocytes, expression of the ZFP36, ZFP36L1, and ZFP36L2 genes is induced by growth factors and cytokines and that ZFP36L1 is a potent regulator of keratinocyte VEGF production. We now further analyzed the localization and function of ZFP36 proteins in the skin, specifically in epidermal keratinocytes. We found that in human epidermis, the ZFP36 protein could be detected in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes, whereas ZFP36L1 and ZFP36L2 were expressed mainly in the basal layer, indicating different and non-redundant functions of the three proteins in the epidermis. Consistently, upon inhibition of ZFP36 or ZFP36L1 expression using specific siRNAs, there was no major effect on expression of the respective other gene. In addition, we demonstrate that both ZFP36 and ZFP36L1 influence keratinocyte cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis in a distinct manner. Finally, we show that similarly as ZFP36L1, ZFP36 is a potent regulator of keratinocyte VEGF production. Thus, it is likely that both proteins regulate angiogenesis via paracrine mechanisms. Taken together, our results suggest that ZFP36 proteins might control reepithelialization and angiogenesis in the skin in a multimodal manner.

Abstract: As essential elements of the tumor microenvironment, the variable oxygenation state of the tumor tissue, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and different cell types are important determinants of carcinogenesis. These elements may also influence how tumor cells respond to therapeutic treatments. In the present study, we assessed the anti-cancer activity of auranofin and its effect on the thioredoxin (Trx) system under conditions that closely resemble the in vivo tumor microenvironment with respect to the oxygen levels and tissue architecture. We utilised an oxygen scheme involving growth of cancer cells under normoxia (20%) and hypoxia (0.1%). We also preconditioned cells with intermittent hypoxia (IH) prior to a prolonged hypoxic incubation. This oxygen scheme did not affect the cytotoxicity of auranofin; however, IH preconditioned cells were less sensitive towards the inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) specific activity upon treatment with auranofin. IH preconditioning also upregulated Trx protein levels in auranofin treated cells. We also compared the activity of auranofin against cancer cells cultured in 2D monolayer and 3D spheroid-based culture models. Auranofin was less potent against cells grown under a more in vivo-like 3D environment. The results presented in this paper implicate the importance of the tumor oxygen environment and tissue architecture in influencing the response of cancer cells towards auranofin.

Abstract: The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are characterized by hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion and overproduction of blood cells. The acquired mutation JAK2V617F plays a central role in these disorders. Mechanisms responsible for MPN HSPC expansion is not fully understood, limiting the effectiveness of current treatments. Endothelial cells (ECs) carrying the JAK2V617F mutation can be detected in patients with MPNs, suggesting that ECs are involved in the pathogenesis of MPNs. Here we report that JAK2V617F-bearing primary murine ECs have increased cell proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro compared to JAK2WT ECs. While there was no difference between JAK2V617F and JAK2WT HSPC proliferation when co-cultured with JAK2WT EC, the JAK2V617F HSPC displayed a relative growth advantage over the JAK2WT HSPC when co-cultured on JAK2V617F EC. In addition, the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor MPL is up regulated in JAK2V617F ECs and contributes to the maintenance/expansion of the JAK2V617F clone over JAK2WT clone in vitro. Considering that ECs are an essential component of the hematopoietic niche and most HSPCs reside in the perivascular niche, our studies suggest that the JAK2V617F-bearing ECs form an important component of the MPN vascular niche and contribute to mutant stem/progenitor cell expansion, likely through a critical role of the TPO/MPL signaling axis.

Abstract: xCT, the functional subunit of the system xc− encoded by the Slc7a11 gene, plays an important role in maintaining intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels. In previous study, we have indicated that xCT deficiency induces OS and that OS triggers apoptosis through JNK pathway, however, this induction of apoptotic features did not fully explain the cell death induced by xCT deficiency. In the current study, we demonstrated that sut melanocytes of xCT deficiency showed activation of both ER stress and autophagy. And that the activation of autophagy by xCT deficiency was mediated by ER stress induced activation of p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways and subsequently inhibited functions of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K survival pathways, ultimately led to autophagic cell death of sut melanocytes. Our novel results provided important insights into understanding the mechanism associated with xCT deficiency.

Abstract: The serum response factor (SRF) is a neuronal activity regulated transcription factor (TF) mediating an immediate early (IEGs, e.g. cFos, Egr1) and actin cytoskeletal gene response. SRF activity is adjusted by two competing cofactor families, ternary complex factors (TCF; e.g. Elk-1) and myocardin related transcription factors (MRTF). We investigated mechanisms of SRF activation upon seizure associated neuronal activity in mice. SRF serine 103 phosphorylation or promoter binding was not obviously changed upon neuronal activation. In contrast, a SRF directed proteomic analysis uncovered established and potentially novel components of SRF associated protein complexes whose abundance was modified by neuronal activity. This included the general transcription factor TFII-I for which we provide a first functional analysis in neurons. TFII-I modulated neuronal SRF target gene expression, enhanced nerve fiber growth and modulated the shape of neuronal growth cones. Interestingly, TFII-I modulated two SRF cofactors, Elk-1 and MRTF-A, in opposite directions. TFII-I and Elk-1 co-expression enhanced SRF target gene abundance, SRF promoter binding and neurite growth, whereas TFII-I and MRTF-A resulted in opposite outcomes. In summary, we provide a first proteome wide analysis of SRF associated proteins. We characterized TFII-I as modulator of SRF activity by imposing differential impact on two SRF cofactors.

Abstract: Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is an important player in chronic liver diseases inducing fibrogenesis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. TGF-β1 promotes pleiotropic modifications at the cellular and matrix microenvironment levels. TGF-β1 was described to enhance production of type I collagen and its associated cross-linking enzyme, the lysyl oxidase-like2 (LOXL2). In addition, TGF-β1 and type I collagen are potent inducers of invadosomes. Indeed, type I collagen fibers induce the formation of active linear invadosomes through the discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1). The goal of our study was to address the role of TGF-β1 in collagen cross-linking and its impact on the formation of linear invadosomes in liver cancer cells. We first report a significant correlation between expressions of TGF-β1, and type I collagen, LOXL2, DDR1 and MT1-MMP in human HCCs. We demonstrate that TGF-β1 promotes a Smad4-dependent up-regulation of DDR1, together with LOXL2, in cultured HCC cells. Moreover, we show that LOXL2-induced collagen cross-linking enhances linear invadosome formation. Altogether, our data demonstrate that TGF-β1 favors linear invadosome formation through the expressions of both the inducers, such as collagen and LOXL2, and the components such as DDR1 and MT1-MMP of linear invadosomes in cancer cells. Meanwhile, our data uncover a new TGF-β1-dependent regulation of DDR1 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Here, we asked whether we could identify pharmacological agents that enhance endogenous stem cell function to promote skin repair, focusing on skin-derived precursors (SKPs), a dermal precursor cell population. Libraries of compounds already used in humans were screened for their ability to enhance the self-renewal of human and rodent SKPs. We identified and validated five such compounds, and showed that two of them, alprostadil and trimebutine maleate, enhanced the repair of full thickness skin wounds in middle-aged mice. Moreover, SKPs isolated from drug-treated skin displayed long-term increases in self-renewal when cultured in basal growth medium without drugs. Both alprostadil and trimebutine maleate likely mediated increases in SKP self-renewal by moderate hyperactivation of the MEK-ERK pathway. These findings identify candidates for potential clinical use in human skin repair, and provide support for the idea that pharmacological activation of endogenous tissue precursors represents a viable therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Βeta-thalassemia, is a hemoglobinopathy characterized by reduced beta-globin chain synthesis, leading to imbalanced globin chain production, ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia. Increasing gamma-globin gene expression is a promising therapeutic approach as it reduces this imbalance by combining with the excess alpha globin chains and producing fetal hemoglobin (HbF). Furthermore, increased iron absorption and repeated blood transfusions lead to iron overload and tissue damage secondary to reactive oxygen species. Compounds exhibiting both antioxidant and HbF inducing activities are, therefore, highly desirable therapeutic agents. Resveratrol, a natural phytoalexin, combines these two activities but is also cytotoxic. Nine hydroxystilbenic resveratrol derivatives were synthesized in an attempt to identify compounds that retain the HbF-inducing and antioxidant activities of resveratrol but exhibit reduced cytotoxicity. Three derivatives (P1, P4 and P11) exhibited similar hemoglobin-inducing properties to resveratrol in K562 cells, however, only P11 showed reduced cytotoxicity. All three derivatives demonstrated variable HbF-inducing activity in primary erythroid progenitor cells from healthy donors. Resveratrol and P11 increased HbF induction significantly, with P11 having the highest activity. Additionally, P4 significantly increased progenitor numbers. A combinatorial treatment in K562 cells using resveratrol and decitabine resulted in a statistically significant increase in hemoglobin-inducing activity only above the level shown by resveratrol alone.

Abstract: During sensory transduction, external physical stimuli are translated into an internal biological signal. In vertebrates, hair cells are specialized mechanosensory receptors that transduce sound, gravitational forces, and head movements into electrical signals that are transmitted with remarkable precision and efficiency to afferent neurons. Hair cells have a conserved structure between species and are also found in the lateral line system of fish, including zebrafish, which serve as an ideal animal model to study sensory transmission in vivo. In this chapter, we describe the methods required to investigate the biophysical properties underlying mechanosensation in the lateral line of the zebrafish in vivo from microphonic potentials and single hair cell patch-clamp recordings to single afferent neuron recordings. These techniques provide real-time measurements of hair-cell transduction and transmission following delivery of controlled and defined stimuli and their combined use on the intact zebrafish provides a powerful platform to investigate sensory encoding in vivo.

Abstract: Background: MRD is seen as the major cause of disease relapse. So, it gives important feedback about conventional treatment success and helps in selecting therapeutic alternatives. We aimed to compare the expression of CD34/CD123 on normal B-cell precursors in bone marrow (“hematogones”) and on leukemic blasts in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) pediatric cases by flowcytometric analysis. Our study conducted on 20 children as a control and 30 B-ALL children cases at diagnosis and after 28days of induction therapy. We found that the less mature hematogones (dim CD45+) that express CD34 lack CD123 expression, whereas the more mature hematogones (moderate CD45+) lack CD34 but always express CD123. In contrast with this discordant pattern of CD34 and CD123 expression in hematogones, blasts in 24 of 30 cases (80%) of B-ALL showed concordant expression pattern of the 2 antigens: 63% (19 of 30) cases expressed both antigens, whereas 17% (5 of 30) expressed neither. Our study concluded that these distinct patterns of CD34/CD123 expression on hematogones (discordant) and B-ALL blasts (concordant) are useful in differentiating small populations of residual blasts from hematogones after induction therapy to detect MRD.

Abstract: Learning and memory are defining features of our own species inherently important to our daily lives and to who we are. Without our memories we cease to exist as a person. Without our ability to learn individuals and collectively our society would cease to function. Diseases of the mind still remain incurable. The interest in understanding of the mechanisms of learning and memory is thus well founded. Given the complexity of such mechanisms, concerted efforts have been made to study them under controlled laboratory conditions, ie, with laboratory model organisms. The zebrafish, although new in this field, is one such model organism. The rapidly developing forward- and reverse genetic methods designed for the zebrafish and the increasing use of pharmacological tools along with numerous neurobiology techniques make this species perhaps the best model for the analysis of the mechanisms of complex central nervous system characteristics. The fact that it is an evolutionarily ancient and simpler vertebrate, but at the same time it possesses numerous conserved features across multiple levels of biological organization makes this species an excellent tool for the analysis of the mechanisms of learning and memory. The bottleneck lies in our understanding of its cognitive and mnemonic features, the topic of this chapter. The current paper builds on a chapter published in the previous edition and continues to focus on associative learning, but now it extends the discussion to other forms of learning and to recent discoveries on memory-related features and findings obtained both in adults and larval zebrafish.

Abstract: Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with exogenous glucocerebrosidase is indicated to treat symptomatic Gaucher disease (GD), a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. ERT with velaglucerase alfa, which is produced in a human cell line using gene activation technology, was studied in a 12-month phase III trial in Japanese patients with type 1 or 3 GD who were switched from imiglucerase ERT (n=6); the current, open-label, 12-month extension study was designed to assess longer-term safety and efficacy. Two adult and three pediatric patients (aged <18years) were enrolled into the extension study. Every-other-week intravenous infusions were administered for 63–78weeks at average doses between 51.5 and 60.7units/kg. Three non-serious adverse events were considered related to velaglucerase alfa treatment, but no patient discontinued from the study. Six serious but non-drug-related adverse events were reported. No patient tested positive for anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies. Hemoglobin concentrations, platelet counts, and liver and spleen volumes (normalized to body weight) in these patients were generally stable over a cumulative 24-month period from the baseline of the parent trial. The data suggest that velaglucerase alfa was well tolerated and maintained clinical stability in Japanese GD patients over 2years after switching from imiglucerase. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01842841.

Abstract: Soft tissue sarcomas are relatively rare, unusual, anatomically diverse group of malignancies. According to the recent literature and medical bulletins, tumor growth and aggressiveness immensely relies on its anatomical locations. However, it is unclear whether the cranio-caudal anatomical axis of the mammalian body can influence sarcoma development and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet deciphered. Here, we investigated the growth pattern of solid sarcoma implanted into the murine cranial and caudal anatomical locations and tried to explore the location specific expression pattern of crucial mammalian mitotic regulators such as Aurora kinase A, Histone H3 and c-Myc in the cranio-caudally originated solid tumors. In addition, the influence of local tumor microenvironment on regional sarcoma growth was also taken into consideration. We found that solid sarcoma developed differentially when implanted into two different anatomical locations and most notably, enhanced tumor growth was observed in case of cranially implanted sarcoma than the caudal sarcoma. Interestingly, Aurora kinase A and c-Myc expression and histone H3 phosphorylation level were comparatively higher in the cranial tumor than the caudal. In addition, variation of tumor stroma in a location specific manner also facilitated tumor growth. Cranial sarcoma microenvironment was well vascularized than the caudal one and consequently, a significantly higher microvessel density count was observed which was parallel with low hypoxic response with sign of local tumor inflammation in this region. Taken together, our findings suggest that differential gradient of mitotic regulators together with varied angiogenic response and local tumor microenvironment largely controls solid sarcoma growth along the cranio-caudal anatomical axis.

Abstract: The recently identified Luman/CREB3-binding partner LRF (Luman/CREB3 recruitment factor) was shown to localize to discrete sub-nuclear foci. Luman is implicated in herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) latency/reactivation and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway; therefore, we sought to characterize the formation of the LRF nuclear foci in the context of cellular signaling and HSV-1 replication. Here, we mapped the nuclear foci-targeting sequence to the central region containing the first leucine zipper (a.a.415-519), and found that the integrity of the whole region appears essential for LRF foci formation. LRF foci integrity was unaffected by inhibition of cellular DNA replication and translation, however, disruption of transcription resulted in altered LRF localization. When compared to other cellular and viral foci LRF co-localized with the nuclear receptor co-activator GRIP1, while the HSV-1 gene products ICP4, ICP27 and VP13/14 disrupted foci formation to varying degrees. Interestingly, cells over-expressing LRF were resistant to productive HSV-1 infection and this resistance was dependent upon protein targeting and an N-terminal transactivation domain. When LRF knockdown cells were subjected to primary infection, HSV-1 gene expression and progeny virus yield were enhanced by ∼3 fold compared to wildtype cells. Taken together, these results indicate that LRF is a key regulator that may act direct or indirectly as a repressor of essential genes required for productive viral infection.
