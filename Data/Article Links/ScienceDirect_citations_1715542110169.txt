Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the mitochondrial DNA mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Our previous study identified mitochondrial tRNAIle A4263G mutation in a large Chinese Han family with maternally-inherited hypertension. This mutation may contribute to mitochondrial Ca2+ cycling dysfuntion, but the mechanism is unclear. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were derived from hypertensive and normotensive individuals, either with or without tRNAIle A4263G mutation. The mitochondrial calcium ([Ca2+]m) in cells from hypertensive subjects with the tRNAIle A4263G mutation, was lower than in cells from normotension or hypertension without mutation, or normotension with mutation (P<0.05). Meanwhile, cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]c) in hypertensive with mutation cells was higher than another three groups. After exposure to caffeine, which could increase the [Ca2+]c by activating ryanodine receptor on endoplasmic reticulum, [Ca2+]c/[Ca2+]m increased higher than in hypertensive with mutation cells from another three groups. Moreover, MCU expression was decreased in hypertensive with mutation cells compared with in another three groups (P<0.05). [Ca2+]c increased and [Ca2+]m decreased after treatment with Ru360 (an inhibitor of MCU) or an siRNA against MCU. In this study we found decreased MCU expression in hypertensive with mutation cells contributed to dysregulated Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondria, and cytoplasmic Ca2+ overload. This abnormality might be involved in the underlying mechanisms of maternally inherited hypertension in subjects carrying the mitochondrial tRNAIle A4263G mutation.

Abstract: Sugar alcohols (SA) are attractive phase change materials for long-term thermal energy storage (TES) applications at low-to-medium temperatures, as i.e. solar seasonal energy storage. Most of them undergo severe undercooling, thus allowing energy storage at temperatures far below the melting point with thermal losses reduction. Besides, some of them could provide very high volumetric energy density at affordable cost. However, sugar alcohols with high latent heat of fusion often exhibit melting temperatures above 100°C. The objective of this work was to found out new sugar alcohol eutectic mixtures that display lower temperatures without significant reduction of the latent heat. A comprehensive analysis of SA relevant properties for TES has been carried out in order to select the most appropriate single SA for mixtures analysis. Sixteen SA-based binary systems have been investigated. Their corresponding phase diagrams have been experimentally and theoretically established. Four eutectic mixtures with potential for long-term TES at temperature around 80°C have been identified. They are: 1) adonitol-erythritol at 30mol% of erythritol, with melting temperature of 87°C and latent heat of fusion of 254J/g; 2) arabitol-erythritol at 40mol% of erythritol, with melting temperature of 86°C and latent heat of fusion of 225J/g; 3) xylitol-erythritol at 36mol% of erythritol, with melting temperature of 82°C and latent heat of fusion of 270J/g; and 4) arabitol-xylitol at 56mol% of xylitol, with melting temperature of 77°C and latent heat of fusion of 243J/g.

Abstract: Phosphorous diffusion gettering (PDG) for different kinds of commercial n-type CZ silicon wafers was investigated for the application in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. It was found that surplus phosphorus diffusion was effective in improving the effective minority carrier lifetime (τeff). Highest τeff was obtained at the optimal diffusion temperature of 840°C, which was almost independent on the diffusion duration at a wide region from 5 to 60min, corresponding to a sheet resistance region from 85 to 21Ω/sq. The segregation coefficient and gettering sites were considered responsible for the gettering mechanism. When the optimized PDG process was applied to SHJ solar cells with three different groups of commercial Si wafers, the average efficiencies were improved from 21.2% to 22.4%, 21.5% to 22.4%, and 22.1% to 22.5%, respectively, where the efficiency gains were mainly contributed by the improvements of open-circuit voltage and fill factor.

Abstract: Tungsten oxide (WOx) can be incorporated into amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells as hole contact and for interface modification between p-type amorphous silicon and indium tin oxide. This paper aims at understanding the influence of tungsten oxides properties on silicon heterojunction solar cells. Using in-system photoelectron spectroscopy on thermally evaporated WOx layers, it was verified that WOx with a stoichiometry close to WO3 features a work function close to 6eV and is therefore suitable as hole contact on silicon. Additionally the oxygen vacancy concentration in WOx was measured using photoelectron spectroscopy. High oxygen vacancy concentrations in WOx lead to a low band bending in the WOx/silicon-junction. Furthermore solar cells were fabricated using the same WOx, and the band bending in these cells is correlated with their fill factors (FF) and open circuit voltages (VOC). Combining these results, the following picture arises: positively charged oxygen vacancies raise the Fermi-level in WOx and reduce the band bending at the WOx/silicon-junction. This, in turn, leads to reduced VOC and FF. Thus, when incorporating WOx into silicon solar cells it is important to minimize the oxygen vacancy density in WOx. Therefore deposition methods, enabling adjustment of the WOx stoichiometry are preferable.

Abstract: PPARγ agonists induced obesity in animal models as a side effect. Microarray experiments reveal that PPARγ agonist upregulates the expression of lipin-1 and this upregulation is correlated with the activity of the agonists. Lipin-1 induced by PPARγ agonists decreased the levels of PPARγ and ERK1/2 phosphorylation through direct interaction with these proteins in 3T3-L1 cells. In PPARγ agonist-treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the knockdown of lipin-1 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited the adipogenesis that was induced by PPARγ agonists. In contrast, PPARγ2 expression was increased, and lipid droplets were accumulated in lipin-1-overexpressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Rosiglitazone (RGZ), a strong PPARγ agonist, synergistically promoted PPARγ dephosphorylation and adipogenesis in lipin-1-overexpressing 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Therefore, lipin-1 has dual functions as a transcriptional cofactor and phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) in the differentiation of preadipocyte cells induced by strong PPARγ agonists. In addition, the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells was markedly upregulated by diacylglycerol (DAG), which was produced by lipin-1. Therefore, lipin-1 induction by PPARγ agonists might be an important factor in understanding the biological mechanism of the agonists’ adverse effects, and this information may be valuable in the development of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) therapeutics with reduced adverse effects and greater tolerability.

Abstract: A series of conjugated polymers with carbazole monomer/dimer/trimer as the donor unit or benzothiadiazole monomer/trimer as the acceptor unit were synthesized and used as donor materials for polymer solar cells (PSCs). The influence of polymer structure on the optical properties and performance of PSCs was investigated in detail. P1 showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.8%. The incorporation of longer donor or acceptor unit leads to a blue shift of absorption spectrum and the polymers became more amorphous due to the large torsion angels in the polymer backbone. After increasing the length of donor or acceptor, the PCE decreased dramatically to 0.43% for P2, 0.23% for P3, and 1.23% for P4. Our results have offered a useful insight to structure–property relationship for high performance polymer solar cells.

RANKL promotes osteoblastic activity in vascular smooth muscle cells by upregulating endothelial BMP-2 release,

Abstract: Introduction
Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta-ligand (RANKL) is thought to promote vascular calcification (VC) by inducing osteoblastic behaviour in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in an ill-defined process. The present study assessed whether RANKL affects pro-osteoblastic paracrine signalling between human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) using both conditioned media transfer and cell co-culture experimental approaches.
Methods and results
For initial experiments (6-well format), HAEC-conditioned media was harvested following 72h exposure to RANKL, and transferred to reporter HASMCs with/without noggin, an inhibitor of pro-osteoblastic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) paracrine signalling. In further experiments, HAECs and HASMCs were co-cultured within the CellMax® Duo, a perfusing bioreactor unit that mimics the flow-mediated co-interaction of these cells within the arterial wall, and RANKL was added to the perfusing media for 72h. At the conclusion of each experiment markers of osteoblastic activity were measured in HASMCs, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mRNA levels of ALP and Runx2, as well as BMP-2 and BMP-4 concentrations. RANKL increased BMP-2 release from HAECs, while exposure of HASMCs to RANKL-treated HAEC-conditioned media induced osteoblastic behaviour in HASMCs, an effect prevented by noggin. Within the CellMax® Duo bioreactor, the addition of RANKL to the intraluminal HAECs also produced an increase in BMP-2 and increased osteoblastic behaviour within the co-cultured HASMC population.
Conclusions
RANKL promotes VC by inducing BMP-2 release from HAECs, which in turn appears to act in a paracrine fashion on the adjacent HASMC population to increase osteoblastic activity.

Abstract: A thermally tunable light filter by using cholesteric liquid crystals as a reflective type of optical device is proposed for an advanced thermo-driven light controller to realize the efficient control of solar-rays without losing the outdoor view and mounting the additional films. The cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) are fabricated to control the temperature dependence of selective transmittance spectra by using the composites of chiral dopants with different magnitude and sign of helical twisting power (HTP). The effects of chiral dopants on temperature dependence of selective wavelength are explained by the theoretical equation introduced for the mixture of chiral dopants. The optical properties for polymer stabilized cholesteric liquid crystal are also investigated by the spectroscopic measurements at different temperature in the various polymer concentrations. The optical performance of the tunable light filter formed by the combination of CLCs with different temperature dependence is demonstrated for the application as a reflective thermo-driven solar-ray controller.

Abstract: All-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalytic system, especially driven by visible light, has attracted intensive interests for realizing sustainable development addressing the increasing environmental pollution and energy issues. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) as one of the most studied semiconductor photocatalysts has been widely applied in solving the above issues. And graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a steady and earth-abundant non-metallic visible-light photocatalyst. Here we demonstrate a facile and rapid method to successfully synthesize all-solid-state Z-scheme g-C3N4/TiO2 nanotube arrays which demonstrates enhanced photocatalytic performance than photocatalyst prepared by traditional post-synthesis under visible light irradiation.

Abstract: Most p-type Si solar cells involves phosphorus-doped emitter by POCl3 diffusion or phosphorus ion-implantation. Although the formation of the phosphorus emitter is known to getter impurities like Fe, the difference in the impact of these two gettering techniques on cell performance is not well quantified. Therefore, this paper compares the gettering efficiency of POCl3 diffusion and phosphorus ion-implantation on Czochralski(Cz) and cast quasi-mono Si wafers. Cz-Si wafers were used to measure bulk lifetime and iron concentration before and after POCl3 diffusion and phosphorus implantation with different doses. Increase in phosphorus implantation dose improved the gettering efficiency by increasing bulk lifetime and decreasing iron concentration but remained inferior to POCl3 diffusion partly due to single side gettering as opposed to double side gettering with higher phosphorus surface concentration during POCl3 diffusion. Moreover, large-area solar cells were fabricated on cast quasi-mono and Cz-Si wafers to quantify the impact of these emitters on cell parameters. POCl3 diffused cast quasi-mono cells showed ~0.4% higher efficiency due to higher bulk lifetime compared to phosphorus implanted emitter. However, phosphorus implanted Cz cells gave ~0.3% higher efficiency due to lower emitter saturation current, resulting from the benefit of in-situ oxide surface passivation during the implant anneal.

Abstract: A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is integrated monolithically with a polymer lens to demonstrate a compact, low-cost and high-power solar energy harvesting system. The proposed polymer lens is composed of a plano-convex lens for concentrating light and a supporting layer for controlling the distance between the lens and DSSC according to its thickness. A single-step polymer replication process with a glass-based lens mold makes it possible to fabricate the polymer lens in a simple and reproducible manner. The power conversion performance of the polymer lens-integrated dye-sensitized (PLD) solar system is optimized by simply controlling the height of the supporting layer. The maximum output power of DSSC is improved by ~50.2% after monolithically integrating with the polymer lens with a 3-mm-thick supporting layer. Finally, the PLD solar system is packaged with a self-cleanable polymer film to protect the lens from the environment and to make the system robust to contamination. Through a simple self-cleaning test, it is found that the PLD system can recover ~95.2% of its original output power.

Abstract: Nanoporous SiO2 antireflective films and films additionally incorporating larger particles in this matrix were prepared by sol-gel processing; the latter exhibits a randomly corrugated surface pattern. Both films show a significant anti-soiling effect versus standardized test dust materials of different particle size distributions. The surface coverages determined by laser scanning microscopy were correlated to the respective optical properties. These laboratory results were compared to long-term outdoor exposure experiments performed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A vast potential of sol-gel derived coatings for anti-soiling applications is demonstrated, nevertheless the high complexity of the particle-surface interaction mechanisms cannot be underestimated.

Abstract: Endothelin induced signaling pathways can affect blood pressure and vascular tone, but the influence of endothelins on tumor cells is also significant. We have detected elevated endothelin-1 secretion from TIMAP (TGF-β inhibited membrane associated protein) depleted vascular endothelial cells. The autocrine signaling activated by the elevated endothelin-1 level through the ETB receptors evoked an angiogenic-like phenotype, the cells assumed an elongated morphology, and enhanced tube formation and wound healing abilities. The depleted protein, TIMAP, is a highly specific and abundant protein in the endothelial cells, and it is a regulatory/targeting subunit for the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c). Protein-protein interaction between the TIMAP-PP1c complex and the endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) was detected, the latter of which is a transmembrane protein that produces the biologically active 21-amino acid form of endothelin-1 from proendothelin. The results indicate that silencing of TIMAP induces a reduction in TIMAP-PP1c activity connected to ECE-1. This leads to an increase in the amount of ECE-1 protein in the plasma membrane and a consequent increase in endothelin-1 secretion. Similarly, activation of PKC, the kinase responsible for ECE-1 phosphorylation increased ECE-1 protein level in the membrane fraction of the endothelial cells. The elevated ECE-1 level was mitigated in time in normal cells, but was clearly preserved in TIMAP-depleted cells. Overall, our results indicate that PKC-phosphorylated ECE-1 is a TIMAP-PP1c substrate and this phosphatase complex has an important role in endothelin-1 production of EC through the regulation of ECE-1 activity.

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester: Inhibition of metastatic cell behaviours via voltage-gated sodium channel in human breast cancer in vitro,

Abstract: Caffeic acid phenethyl ester, derived from natural propolis, has been reported to have anti-cancer properties. Voltage-gated sodium channels are upregulated in many cancers where they promote metastatic cell behaviours, including invasiveness. We found that micromolar concentrations of caffeic acid phenethyl ester blocked voltage-gated sodium channel activity in several invasive cell lines from different cancers, including breast (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468), colon (SW620) and non-small cell lung cancer (H460). In the MDA-MB-231 cell line, which was adopted as a ‘model’, long-term (48h) treatment with 18μM caffeic acid phenethyl ester reduced the peak current density by 91% and shifted steady-state inactivation to more hyperpolarized potentials and slowed recovery from inactivation. The effects of long-term treatment were also dose-dependent, 1μM caffeic acid phenethyl ester reducing current density by only 65%. The effects of caffeic acid phenethyl ester on metastatic cell behaviours were tested on the MDA-MB-231 cell line at a working concentration (1μM) that did not affect proliferative activity. Lateral motility and Matrigel invasion were reduced by up to 14% and 51%, respectively. Co-treatment of caffeic acid phenethyl ester with tetrodotoxin suggested that the voltage-gated sodium channel inhibition played a significant intermediary role in these effects. We conclude, first, that caffeic acid phenethyl ester does possess anti-metastatic properties. Second, the voltage-gated sodium channels, commonly expressed in strongly metastatic cancers, are a novel target for caffeic acid phenethyl ester. Third, more generally, ion channel inhibition can be a significant mode of action of nutraceutical compounds.

Abstract: A novel thermo-sensitive smart film (TSF) is demonstrated using liquid crystal embedded polymers on a silver nanowire (AgNW) coated film. AgNW networks are used to provide thermal energy to the liquid crystal embedded polymer layer via Joule heating. The TSF changes from an opaque to a transparent state at the transition temperature as a result of the phase transition of the liquid crystal. The anomalous diffraction approach (ADA) is adopted to predict the transmittance of the TSF. We also present an effective method to operate the TSF that reduces the response time and the consumed energy by adopting a dynamic power control.

Abstract: We present progress to develop low-cost interdigitated back contact solar cells with pc-Si/SiO2/c-Si passivated contacts formed by plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). PIII is a lower-cost implantation technique than traditional beam line implantation due to its simpler design, lower operating costs, and ability to run high doses (1E14–1E18 cm−2) at low ion energies (20eV–10keV). These benefits make PIII ideal for high throughput production of patterned passivated contacts, where high-dose, low-energy implantations are made into thin (20–200nm) a-Si layers instead of into the wafer itself. For this work symmetric passivated contact test structures (~100nm thick) grown on n-Cz wafers with pH3 PIII doping gave implied open circuit voltage (iVoc) values of 730mV with Jo values of 2fA/cm2. Samples doped with B2H6 gave iVoc values of 690mV and Jo values of 24fA/cm2, outperforming BF3 doping, which gave iVoc values in the 660–680mV range. Samples were further characterized by SIMS, photoluminescence, TEM, EELS, and post-metallization TLM to reveal micro- and macro-scopic structural, chemical and electrical information.

Abstract: The use of ZnTe buffer layers at the back contact of CdTe solar cells has been credited with contributing to recent improvements in both champion cell efficiency and module stability. To better understand the controlling physical and chemical phenomena, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) were used to study the evolution of the back contact region during rapid thermal processing (RTP) of this layer. After activation the ZnTe layer, initially nanocrystalline and homogenous, transforms into a bilayer structure consisting of a disordered region in contact with CdTe characterized by significant Cd–Zn interdiffusion, and a nanocrystalline layer that shows evidence of grain growth and twin formation. Copper, co-evaporated uniformly within ZnTe, is found to dramatically segregate and aggregate after RTP, either collecting near the ZnTe|Au interface or forming CuxTe clusters in the CdTe layer at defects or grain boundaries near the interface. Analysis of TEM images revealed that Zn accumulates at the edge of these clusters, and three-dimensional APT images confirmed that these are core–shell nanostructures consisting of Cu1.4Te clusters encased in Zn. These changes in morphology and composition are related to cell performance and stability.

Abstract: Most boron diffusion technologies result in the formation of an undesirable boron-rich layer (BRL) on the emitter surface. This paper reports on a study of the impact of gradual etching of the BRL on n-type silicon solar cell performance. It is found that gradual removal of the BRL improves surface passivation and bulk lifetime in the finished cell, while over-etching of the BRL results in a sharp decrease in fill factor due to the increased n-factor and series resistance. It is shown that the optimum chemical etching of the BRL formed as a byproduct of the screen-printed boron emitter diffusion used in this study raised the cell efficiency by ~0.5%, resulting in 20.0% efficient large area (239cm2) n-type solar cells. The change in BRL thickness and morphology as a function of chemical etching time was investigated by TEM and AES measurements to explain the quantitative impact of BRL removal on cell performance.

Abstract: Zinc oxysulfide has been grown by spatial atomic layer deposition (S-ALD) and successfully applied as buffer layer in Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells. S-ALD combines high deposition rates (up to nm/s) with the advantages of conventional ALD, i.e. excellent control of film composition and superior uniformity over large-area and even non-flat substrates. Diethylzinc, water and hydrogen sulfite (H2S) have been used as zinc, oxygen and sulfur precursor, respectively. The S/(S+O) ratio in the film is accurately controlled by exposing the substrate simultaneously to both H2O and H2S precursors, which are pre-mixed and co-injected in the same deposition zone. The optoelectronic and morphological properties of Zn(O,S) are characterized as a function of the S/(S+O) ratio. Zn(O,S) buffer layers with different values of S/(S+O) ratio are applied in CIGS solar cells. An optimum value of S/(S+O) ratio of about 0.4 is found for which both the short circuit current density (Jsc=34.2mA/cm2) and cell efficiency (η=15.9%) increase, as compared to reference cells with CdS buffer layer (Jsc=32.1mA/cm2, η=15.5%).

Abstract: Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films were prepared by spin-coating deposition of sol–gel precursor followed by sulfurization in sulfur atmosphere. A comparative study on the properties of the CZTS thin films sulfurized by using dynamic annealing and static annealing approaches was carried out. A higher sulfur partial pressure processed from static annealing was demonstrated. Static annealing contributed to the reduction of Sn loss. The CZTS thin films sulfurized by static annealing showed larger grains, better crystallinity and thinner MoS2 layer, but more ZnS on surface and minor Cu2−xS, SnS2 and SnS at the back surface. Diffusion of Zn into MoS2 layer was found to be associated with those minor secondary phases at the back surface. Solar cells incorporating the CZTS thin films sulfurized by static annealing exhibited a better cell performance with the device efficiency as high as 6.15%, which was further improved to 6.68% by using hydrochloric acid solution to etch ZnS at the surface and inhibiting the decomposition reaction of CZTS at the back surface based on the use of a thin ZnO nanolayer barrier.

Abstract: Epigenetic regulation by histone methyltransferase G9a is known to control autophagic responses. As the link between autophagy and metabolic homeostasis is widely accepted, we investigated whether G9a affects metabolic circuitries to affect autophagic response in glioma cells. Both pharmacological inhibition and siRNA mediated knockdown of G9a increased autophagy marker LC3B in glioma cells. G9a inhibitor BIX-01294 (BIX) induced Akt-dependent increase in HIF-1α expression and activity. Inhibition of Akt-HIF-1α axis reversed BIX-mediated (i) increase in LC3B expression and (ii) decrease in Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) phosphorylation. YAP1 over-expression abrogated BIX induced increase in LC3B expression. Interestingly, BIX induced increase in metabolic modelers TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator) and PKM2 (Pyruvate kinase M2) were crucial for BIX-mediated changes, as transfection with TIGAR mutant or PKM2 siRNA reversed BIX-mediated alterations in pYAP1 and LC3B expression. Coherent with the in vitro observation, BIX had no significant effect on the tumor burden in heterotypic xenograft glioma mouse model. Elevated LC3B and PKM2 in BIX-treated xenograft tissue was accompanied by decreased YAP1 levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that Akt-HIF-1α axis driven PKM2-YAP1 cross talk activates autophagic responses in glioma cells upon G9a inhibition.

Abstract: Objective/background
Sickle-cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic blood disease characterized by chronic inflammation and a heterogeneous clinical picture. Serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) levels are associated with the clinical course of SCA. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the frequency of the polymorphisms TNF-alpha-308 G→A, IL-10-1082 G→A, IL-10-819 C→T, and IL-10-592 A→C; serum TNF-alpha; and IL-10 levels, and the incidence of clinical events in SCA patients.
Methods
Polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed on 25 adults with SCA at the steady state; their data were compared with those for 26 healthy individuals.
Results
The most frequent genotype of the TNF-alpha polymorphism was GG (low producer), and the most frequent genotype of the IL-10 polymorphisms was “low producer” (ACC ACC, ACC ATA, ATA ATA). The TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in SCA in patients with acute chest syndrome (ACS). The IL-10 levels were reduced in polytransfusion and in patients with ACS.
Conclusion
The patients presented prevalence of TNF-alpha and IL-10 low-profile producer. The cytokine serum levels presented an association with the presence of polytransfusion and ACS in SCA patients.

Abstract: Particularly in hot climates, various pigments are used to formulate desired non-white colors that stay cooler in the sun than alternatives. These cool pigments provide a high near-infrared (NIR) reflectance in the solar infrared range of 700–2500nm, and also a color specified by a reflectance spectrum in the 400–700nm visible range. Still cooler materials can be formulated by also utilizing the phenomenon of fluorescence (photoluminescence). Ruby, Al2O3:Cr, is a prime example, with efficient emission in the deep red (~694nm) and near infrared (700–800nm). A layer of synthetic ruby crystals on a white surface having an attractive red color can remain cooler in the sun than conventional red materials. Ruby particles can also be used as a red/pink pigment. Increasing the Cr:Al ratio produces a stronger (darker) pigment but doping above ~3wt% Cr2O3 causes concentration quenching of the fluorescence. The system quantum efficiency for lightly doped ruby-pigmented coatings over white is high, 0.83±0.10.

Abstract: Solar thermal technology has gained importance during its globalization and industrialization, due to its effective conversion of solar energy into thermal energy. Common flat black surface solar collectors generally employ selective solid coating as a solar radiation absorber; nevertheless, these collectors have several shortcomings such as low efficiency, corrosion, heating losses and cannot withstand high incident flux. Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the nanofluids based Direct Absorber Solar Collectors (DASC) can harvest solar energy more efficiently compared to the conventional solar collectors. Present work reports the investigation of dispersion stability, optical and thermal properties of partially unzipped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PUMWNTs) based nanofluids for DASC. PUMWNTs were prepared by modified Hummers method. Nanofluids were prepared by dispersing calculated amount of PUMWNTs in DI water and ethylene glycol (EG). Absorption and transmittance studies were conducted using UV–vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Absorption spectra confirmed the stability of nanofluids. The extinction coefficient of nanofluids shows significant improvement as compared with that of base fluids even at low concentration. Furthermore, the temperature dependent thermal conductivity study with different volume fractions carried out for DI water and EG based nanofluids reported considerable enhancement of 27% and 20.97% respectively. Based on enhanced optical and thermal properties, PUMWNTs dispersed nanofluids are found to be promising to increase the overall efficiency of DASC.

Abstract: Legume lectins are the most thoroughly studied group of lectins and have been widely linked to many pathological processes. Their use as immunohistochemistry markers for cell profiling and cancer diagnosis have made these molecules important tools for immunological studies and have stimulated the prospection and characterization of new lectins. The crystal structures of a recombinant seed lectin from Vatairea macrocarpa (rVML) and its complexes with GalNAcα1-O-Ser, GalNAc and α-lactose, have been determined at 1.90, 1.97, 2.70 and 1.83Å resolution, respectively. Small angle X-ray scattering and calorimetry assays have confirmed the same pH stable oligomerization pattern and binding profiles proposed for its wild-type counterpart. In silico analyzes have explored the potential of this recombinant lectin as new tool for cancer research through a comparative profile with other legume lectins widely used for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The results suggest the recognition of specific epitopes exhibited on different cancer cells as a process that relies on the disposition of hydrophobic clusters and charged regions around the lectin carbohydrate-binding site, favouring the anchorage of different groups in the antigen boundaries, highlighting the different potential of each analyzed lectin. In conclusion, the experimental results and comparative analysis show that rVML is as a promising tool for cancer research, able to bind with high affinity specific tumor-associated antigens, highly stable and easily produced.

Abstract: A great deal of attention has been directed towards the development of facile synthetic methods for semiconductor materials that allow for doping. In this work, Cu-doped CdSeTe-alloyed quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized via a non-injection one pot synthesis route and used as a sensitizer in solar cells. The lattice incorporation of CdSeTe QDs with Cu2+ was evidenced by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and ab initio simulation. We have performed characterization on the relaxed geometry structure, bonding character, and band alignment of the Cu-doped CdSeTe QDs based on rigorous ab initio calculations. Our main objective is to fully understand the effect of the Cu2+ dopant on the physical properties of CdSeTe QDs, which would be very useful to further understand the mechanism of photoelectric conversion. HR-TEM analysis showed ~7nm and ~9nm particles for CdSeTe and Cu-doped CdSeTe nanocrystals (NCs), respectively. It was found that the open circuit voltage (Voc) of Cu-doped CdSeTe NCs decreases with respect to that of the undoped ones. The QD-based solar cell with Cu-doped Cu0.2Cd0.8Se0.6Te0.4 exhibited a photo-conversion efficiency of 1.25% (VOC=0.593V, JSC=3.78mA/cm2, FF=55.5%), which was higher than the reference CdSeTe NCs under AM1.5G at 100mW/cm2 simulated sunlight radiation conditions.

Abstract: Life cycle assessment (LCA) offers valuable insights for solar firms, including identification of opportunities for potential cost reduction at energy and material usage hotspots and establishment of environmental performance advantages over competitors. However, many advanced solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies contain key functional materials that are challenging to assess with LCA because they are jointly produced as coproducts or byproducts. Joint production is inherently challenging to LCA because it introduces the methodological problem of allocation, or the need to distribute environmental impact among multiple products of a single process. Additionally, these materials suffer from increased risk of price volatility, which further confound allocation approaches. Using two case studies of jointly-produced PV-relevant raw materials, tellurium and terbium, the present work demonstrates some of the unique methodological challenges faced during LCA; namely, variation in results based upon choice of allocation method and parametric variability in allocation factor inputs. Results show that choice of allocation method leads to variation in cumulative energy demand (CED) by a factor of 6 for tellurium and a factor of 27 for terbium while choice of averaging period for time-dependent data (i.e. price), while nearly negligible for tellurium (1–3% decrease), leads to variation in CED by 25% for terbium. Further, despite representing smaller contributions by mass to total joint process output, not all coproducts and byproducts are affected the same way by choice of allocation method, i.e. tellurium CED was greater by mass allocation than economic, whereas the reverse was true for terbium. These findings inform best practices helpful for LCA practitioners to generate more robust environmental impact assessments and inform decision making with greater resolution.

Abstract: Currently, natural IgM antibodies are considered to be the constitutively secreted products of B-1 cells in mice and humans. In this study, we found that mouse epithelial cells, including liver epithelial cells and small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), could express IgM that also showed natural antibody activity. Moreover, similar to the B-1 cell-derived natural IgM that can be upregulated by TLR9 agonists (mimicking bacterial infection), the expression of epithelial cell-derived natural IgM could also be significantly increased by TLR9 signaling. More importantly, the epithelial cell-derived IgM was polyreactive, and it could recognize single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and insulin with low affinity; additionally, TLR9 agonists could enhance it in a MyD88-dependent manner. Furthermore, epithelial cell-derived IgM could bind various bacteria; therefore, it could be involved in anti-infection responses. Together, these results highlight the fact that epithelial cells are an important source of natural IgM, in addition to that produced by B-1 cells, and IgM contributes to the innate immune responses in local tissues, further demonstrating that the epithelium is a first line of defense in the protection against invading microbes.

Abstract: We demonstrate diffractive rear side gratings to enhance the near infrared light trapping and thus the quantum efficiency of wafer based crystalline silicon solar cells. Binary crossed gratings with a period of 1µm, produced via nanoimprint lithography and plasma etching, are electrically decoupled from the solar cell by a thin dielectric passivation layer, creating an electrically flat, but optically rough rear side. We fabricated solar cells with thicknesses of 250, 150 and 100µm and demonstrate a short circuit current density gain due to the grating of 1.2, 1.6 and 1.8mA/cm2 for solar cells with planar front surface. For solar cells with pyramidally textured front surface the grating also leads to a small current density gain in the near infrared of approximately 0.3mA/cm2 according to EQE measurements, leading to the best cell's efficiency of 21.1%. By optical simulations we show the potential of the grating structure and identify losses in the fabricated solar cells.

Abstract: Aldehyde dehydrogenases participate in a variety of cellular homeostatic mechanisms like metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, whereas recently, they have been implicated in normal and cancer cell stemness. We explored roles for ALDH3A1 in conferring resistance to chemotherapeutics/radiation/oxidative stress and whether ectopic overexpression of ALDH3A1 could lead to alterations of gene expression profile associated with cancer stem cell-like phenotype. MCF-7 cells were stably transfected either with an empty vector (mock) or human aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 cDNA. The expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 in MCF-7 cells was associated with altered cell proliferation rate and enhanced cell resistance against various chemotherapeutic drugs (4-hydroxyperoxycyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, and 5-fluorouracil). Aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1 expression also led to increased tolerance of MCF-7 cells to gamma radiation and hydrogen peroxide-induced stress. Furthermore, aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1-expressing MCF-7 cells exhibited gene up-regulation of cyclins A, B1, B2, and down-regulation of cyclin D1 as well as transcription factors p21, CXR4, Notch1, SOX2, SOX4, OCT4, and JAG1. When compared to mock cells, no changes were observed in mRNA levels of ABCA2 and ABCB1 protein pumps with only a minor decrease of the ABCG2 pump in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1-expressing cells. Also, the adhesion molecules EpCAM and CD49F were also found to be up-regulated in aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1expressing cells. Taken together, ALDH3A1 confers a multi-modality resistance phenotype in MCF-7 cells associated with slower growth rate, increased clonogenic capacity, and altered gene expression profile, underlining its significance in cell homeostasis.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus impairs osteogenesis in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) has been extensively applied for bone defect restoration and has been shown to activate the Wnt signaling pathway. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of BMP2 on the cell proliferation and osteogenesis of type 2 diabetic BMSCs in rats and explore whether BMP2 induced osteogenesis via the stimulation of Wnt signaling pathway. The cell experiments were divided into DM (diabetic BMSCs), BMP25 (induced with 25ng/ml BMP2), BMP100 (induced with 100ng/ml BMP2) and BMP25 +XAV groups. All cells with or without the different concentrations of BMP2 were cultured under the same experimental conditions. The in vitro results indicated that BMP2 enhanced cell proliferation by 130%–157% and osteogenic differentiation by approximately two-fold in type 2 diabetic BMSCs. The expression levels of β-catenin, cyclin D1, Runx2 and c-myc related to the Wnt signaling pathway were also upregulated from 180% to 212% in BMP2-induced type 2 diabetic rat BMSCs, while the level of GSK3β decreased to 43%. In BMP2-induced type 2 diabetic BMSCs with calcium phosphate cement (CPC) scaffolds for osteoblast study in vivo, the appearance of newly formed bone dramatically increased to 175% compared with type 2 diabetic BMSCs. These data demonstrated that BMP2 enhanced bone regeneration in diabetic BMSCs by stimulating the Wnt signaling pathway with the accumulation of β-catenin and the depressed expression of GSK3β. Diabetic BMSCs associated with BMP2 might be a potential tissue-engineered construct for bone defects in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: With this work, we introduce numeric three-dimensional simulation of metal spiking into highly boron-doped surfaces of n-type silicon solar cells, which is moreover performed with a simulation of the quasi-steady-state photoconductance technique. This setup serves as a virtual experiment to simulate the dark saturation current density j0,met of metallized boron-doped emitters with respect to metal spikes originating from the silver–aluminum (Ag–Al) contact. With the results obtained from this simulation model we approach quality and quantity of increased j0,met and give detailed insight to which degree a solar cell’s performance is possibly harmed by this effect. We show that metal spikes penetrating into boron-doped emitters are of harmless nature concerning j0,met until their tips reach depths where boron doping concentration is lower than approximately 1018cm−3. Deeper spikes then lead to an exponential increase in j0,met as more and more carriers from emitter and also the base are able to diffuse to its tip and recombine there. With the help of j0-results obtained experimentally in combination with the simulation results, we discuss the influence of spikes on emitter recombination, the benefits that can be achieved with deeper emitter doping profiles, and suggestions for the further development of pastes to contact boron-doped surfaces.

Abstract: Autophagy is a recycling program which allows cells to adapt to metabolic needs and to stress. Defects in autophagy can affect metabolism, aging, proteostasis and inflammation. Autophagy pathway genes, including autophagy related 7 (Atg7), have been associated with the regulation of skin pigmentation, and autophagy defects disturb the biogenesis and transport of melanosomes in melanocytes as well as transfer and processing of melanin into keratinocytes. We have previously shown that mice whose melanocytes or keratinocytes lack Atg7 (and thus autophagy) as a result of specific gene knockout still retained functioning melanosome synthesis and transfer, and displayed only moderate reduction of pigmentation. In cell culture the Atg7 deficient melanocytes were prone to premature senescence and dysregulation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) signaling. To elucidate the biochemical basis of this phenotype, we performed a study on global gene expression, protein secretion and phospholipid composition in Atg7 deficient versus Atg7 expressing melanocytes. In cell culture Atg7 deficient melanocytes showed a pro-inflammatory gene expression signature and secreted higher levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand -1,-2,-10 and −12 (Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, Cxcl12), which are implicated in the pathogenesis of pigmentary disorders and expressed higher amounts of matrix metalloproteinases -3 and -13 (Mmp3, Mmp13). The analysis of membrane phospholipid composition identified an increase in the arachidonic- to linoleic acid ratio in the autophagy deficient cells, as well as an increase in oxidized phospholipid species that act as danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The secretion of inflammation related factors suggests that autophagy deficient melanocytes display a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and we propose oxidized lipid mediators as novel components of this SASP.

Abstract: Solar energy, along with other renewable resources, could potentially solve environmental problems, as demonstrated by recent developments in the use of solar energy, such as solar photocatalysis. Solar photocatalytic technology has been demonstrated to be effective for treating groundwater, drinking water, wastewater and air and soil pollution. In this study, a solar photocatalytic application for wastewater decontamination is presented. Luminescent material has been evaluated as up-conversion material for enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Wastewater decontamination by heterogeneous photocatalysis has been developed in a slurry photo-reactor, using TiO2 as a photocatalyst. The photoactivity of TiO2 under several sun irradiation conditions was investigated. The up-conversion luminescence agent ZBLAN, a rare-earth (Yb-Er-Tm) co-doped fluoride glass (ZrF4– BaF2–LaF3–AlF3–NaF), was incorporated to enhance the solar-driven activity of TiO2 because this material could transform the unused near-infrared sunlight tail into UV–vis radiation available for photoreaction activation. The use of ZBLAN has demonstrated an improvement over ordinary titanium dioxide photocatalytic activity under sunlight irradiation for the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants in wastewater. Our results demonstrating the contribution of up-conversion luminescence to the improved photoactivity of titanium dioxide suggest that it can be used to develop new technologies for treating wastewater using solar light.

Abstract: Polyurethane polymers were directly synthesized via bulk polymerization as novel solid–solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) for thermal energy storage. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) with 4000 and 6000g/mol number average molecular weight were used as phase change functional chain, castor oil as the skeleton, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) were individually served as coupling reagent. The molecular structure, crystalline properties, phase change performances, thermal reliability and stability of the synthesized SSPCMs were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry analysis (TG), respectively. The XRD patterns and POM images showed that the synthesized SSPCMs have the same crystalline structure and confined crystallization compared with pristine PEG. The DSC results indicated that the synthesized SSPCMs have high latent heats and a suitable phase change temperature range, and the maximum latent heats in melting and freezing process for the SSPCMs are 117.70J/g and 109.00J/g, respectively. Thermal cycling test and TG analysis results indicated that synthesized SSPCMs have good thermal reliability and stability. The prepared SSPCMs show large potential application in the area of solar energy storage.

Abstract: Fe0.5TiOPO4/C composite was used as anode material for LIB and exhibits excellent cycling performance when the electrode is cycled in two different voltage ranges [3.0–1.3V] and [3.0–0.02V] where different insertion mechanisms were involved. A detailed in situ XANES spectroscopy study coupled to the electrochemical analyses, clearly established that the structure of Fe0.5TiOPO4/C electrode materials is preserved when cycled between 3.0 and 1.3V. Furthermore, a formation of new phase at the end of first discharge was evidenced, with a reversible capacity of 100mAhg−1 after 50 cycles at C/5 rate. At highly lithiated states, [3.0–0.02V] voltage range, a reduction-decomposition reaction highlights the Li-insertion/extraction behaviors, and low phase crystallinity is observed during cycling, in addition an excellent rate behavior and a reversible capacity of 250mAhg−1 can still be maintained after 50 cycles at high cycling rate 5C.

Abstract: In a series of lifetime experiments, we examine the impact of hydrogen on the permanent deactivation of the boron-oxygen (BO)-related defect center in Czochralski-grown boron-doped silicon. In the first experiment, the hydrogen concentration in the external source is varied by the deposition of dielectric layers containing various hydrogen concentrations (aluminum oxide and silicon nitride layers) before applying a fast-firing step at high temperature (>800°C). In the second experiment, the sample cooling rate after high-temperature treatment is varied without hydrogen-rich dielectric layer being present and the surface passivation based on aluminum oxide is applied at low temperature afterwards. In both experiments, it is observed that the sample cooling after the high-temperature treatment has the major impact on the dynamics of BO deactivation process and fast cooling rates enable a fast deactivation. No direct impact of the hydrogen content in the dielectric layers being present during the fast-firing step on the dynamics of the BO deactivation is observed. However, the highest lifetimes in excess of 1ms are only achievable when a hydrogenation step is performed, which we interpret in terms of a hydrogen passivation of background defects of hitherto unknown nature. In a third experiment, we apply an organic passivation layer by spin-coating, which is dried at low temperature (130°C). We find in this experiment that even without any hydrogen intentionally introduced into the silicon bulk, an effective deactivation of the BO center can be observed, clearly supporting that no hydrogen is required to enable the BO deactivation.

Abstract: The synergistic effect of silver nanoparticle sensitization and surface disordering of mixed phased titania makes it highly active photocatalyst under visible light. The physico-chemical analysis of the samples indicates that surface plasmon induced local field enhancement, reduction in the band gap due to hydrogenation, intrinsic band offset at the phase interface and the resultant swift migration of photo-generated carrier to catalyst surface makes the catalyst highly visible active. The photoactivity of the hydrogenated mixed phase Ag/TiO2 catalyst is found to be about ~28.2 times high compared to the reference catalyst DP25 in degradation of methylene blue under visible light irradiation while an opposite behavior is observed under UV light. One the most distinctive feature of the catalyst concluded on the basis of its reusability test is the multicyclic-stability of its performance under visible light which shows it to be robust.

Abstract: Pure chlorobenzene (CBZ) and 2-propanol (IPA) or mixed-solvent assisted spin-coating have been applied to one-step fabricate CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films, respectively. However, with the treatment of pure- or mixed solvent, there are obvious differences in the formation of CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite films with full coverage and large crystal grain size, as well as the role in the photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, the nucleation and growth dynamics of perovskite crystals have been taken into consideration with the activation energy of transporting crystallizing segments across the crystal interface and the formation free energy of a critical-sized nucleus. Planar heterojunction (PHJ) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on CH3NH3PbI3 by mixed-solvent treatment exhibit a poor power conversion efficiency (PCE) owing to the formation little amount of perovskite crystals with low crystallinity. While pure CBZ treatment renders the corresponding device get efficiency of 8.1%, which is due to the formation of uniform CH3NH3PbI3 thin film with higher surface coverage and crystallinity. Inversely, PSCs based on CH3NH3PbI3−xClx with mixed-solvent shows the highest PCE of 9.2%, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.06mA/cm2 and fill factor (FF) of 63.6% with high device reproducibility and low photocurrent hysteresis, because of possessing higher light absorption ascribed from bigger crystal size and better surface morphology with no pin-holes. These results will provide significant guidance for CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite device performance optimization and large-scale application by pure- and mixed-solvent treatment.

Abstract: Here, we review 33 life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technologies that have had a holistic coverage in their assessments and/or have included ecodesign aspects. Only five of them were found to have a comprehensive life cycle and impact coverage, and their analyses highlighted the importance of (i) including the entire life cycle of the PV system, in particular the often-omitted disposal stage, and (ii) assessing all relevant impact categories and not just climate change or energy requirements to minimise the risk of burden-shifting. Out of the 28 studies embracing ecodesign considerations in parts of the PV life cycle, the analysis of the eleven of them addressing primary energy demand during module production suggests that electricity consumption during the metal deposition processes is a top contributor and should be prioritised by PV technology developers. A similar analysis of the ten studies having included the balance of system components (BOS) in the assessments showed that these contribute significantly to most environmental impact categories. Beyond recommending that stakeholders in the PV field rely on LCA to support decision-making and to guide scientific research and technological development, we strongly advocate LCA practitioners to include the entire PV system, including the BOS, to identify ecodesign opportunities without risking potential burden-shifting across the different parts of the system and across impact categories.

Abstract: Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrate is a widely used polymer in the optoelectronics industry, its optical properties, such as light transmittance, haze, etc., are of significant importance in organic light emitting diodes and photovoltaics. In this paper, we present a broadband anti-reflective nanostructure on PET substrate prepared by means of plasma etching in a mixture of argon and oxygen gas. Etching time was varied for optimizing the optical transmittance. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images revealed formation of nanostructures of sub-wavelength dimensions resembling pores at the surface. Atomic force microscopy confirmed that the graded porosity was generated from the randomly distributed pores of different sizes and depths. Due to the formation of a gradient refractive index, nanostructured surface exhibited broadband and quasi-omnidirectional anti-reflection properties. A maximum total transmittance of ~99% at 835nm was achieved for both sides treated PET without significant increase in light scattering or haze. Moreover, both sides treated PET showed polarization insensitivity upto 48°, which was not exhibited by untreated PET. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed generation of degradation products, which consisted of carbon and oxygen containing functional groups. Durability of the anti-reflection layer was tested and proved to be satisfactory.

Abstract: A coralline vanadium pentoxide nanorod architecture on an indium-doped tin oxide substrate for energy-efficient electrochromism has been prepared by a simple annealing treatment from an overfilled amorphous three-dimensionally ordered macroporous vanadia film. The coralline vanadium pentoxide nanorod architecture exhibited multicolor electrochromic performance (yellow, blue-green, and olive), high transmittance modulations (25% and 27% at the typical wavelengths of 460nm and 1000nm, respectively), and fast switching speeds (4.8s for coloration and 7.2s for bleaching at 890nm). In addition, the coralline vanadium pentoxide nanorod architecture exhibited desirable cycle stability. After 100 cycles, negligible transmittance modulation decreased in the visible spectrum, and a decrease of only approximately 5.6% was found in the near-infrared spectrum. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the majority of the current response of the redox reactions of the coralline V2O5 nanorod architecture was surface controlled, which resulted in desirable cycling stability and fast switching speeds. A indium-doped tin oxide substrate/vanadia/liquid electrolyte/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/indium-doped tin oxide substrate electrochromic device was assembled, and the device showed multicolor changes with acceptable transmittance modulation and good cycling stability.

Abstract: Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a widely used antipsychotic drug with antagonistic effect on dopamine receptors. Accumulating evidence has shown that CPZ plays a neuroprotective role in various models of toxicity and apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanism contributing to this protective effect remains unclear. Here, we evaluate the effect of CPZ on mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in the neuron system. Higher levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and tissue factor (TF) but lower apoptotic rate were found in hippocampus of CPZ-treated schizophrenic patients compared with non-antipsychotic treated controls. Additionally, both short-term and long-term treatment of CPZ in rats could up-regulate the levels of Bcl-2 and TF with no cytotoxic effects. In the in vitro experiment, expression of Bcl-2 was up-regulated in the C6 glioma cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-TF recombinant plasmid. Furthermore, in another independent rat model of apoptosis, compared with the group administrated with alcohol only, the brains of the CPZ-pretreated rats showed lower expression of cleaved caspase-3, cytochrome c and Bax, but higher expression of Bcl-2 and TF. Our data demonstrate that CPZ exerts its neuronal protective effects through inhibiting the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by up-regulating TF expression, thus providing new insight into CPZ function and application.

Abstract: Enhancement of the optical and electrical properties of Cd-rich NixCd1−xO alloys was achieved through an electrochemical procedure – their biasing at a constant negative potential into an electrolyte. Depending on the conductivity of the film (correlated to x), the films changed their color from transparent-yellowish to black. For a certain bias, the coloration became permanent and irreversible. Electron concentration for some samples increased for better than two orders of magnitude upon the coloration, while as the mobility decreased for a factor of 2–10. Rutherford Back Scattering (RBS) analysis revealed oxygen deficiency for the colored samples. The XRD analysis showed that the coloration could be associated to a partial reduction of CdO2 to CdO. XPS analysis suggested complex red-ox transitions of the two Ni and two Cd-oxides within the alloy. Ni2p electrons suggested that a partial NiO (transparent) transition to Ni2O3 (black) is likely the responsible process for the occurrence of the intensive light trapping. Since the NixCd1−xO band gap is tunable with x, one may conclude that this electrochemical procedure is motivating for tuning/modification/enhancement of the both, the absorption and conductivity of NixCd1−xO films for their possible application as integrated film photoanodes (TCO and PEC cell in one) within a hybrid water splitting device.

Abstract: Objective/background
Specific chromosomal translocations are found in human leukemias and lymphomas. These translocations are closely related to particular histological and immunological phenotypes. In Burkitt’s lymphoma, translocation t(8;14)(q24;q32), which involves the c-myc gene (8q24) and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus (14q32), accounts for 90–95% of all chromosomal translocations. This translocation can be found in 2–5% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Long-distance polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) assays, which can identify oncogene/Ig gene rearrangement, can detect these fusion genes. The objective of this study was to detect t(8;14) c-myc/IgH gene rearrangement by LD-PCR in patients with DLBCL.
Methods
In this study, 54 DLBCL cases were tested by LD-PCR with specific primers. LD-PCR was used for two breakpoints in both the IgH gene (joining region and γ switch region) and the myc gene (Exons 2 and 3).
Results
As much as 1.85% of the samples were positive for the γ constant region and Exon 2 of the myc gene.
Conclusion
LD-PCR can be used for the detection of t(8;14) c-myc/IgH gene rearrangement in patients with DLBCL.

Abstract: Objective/Background
Progesterone-receptor negativity (PR−) is predictive of adverse outcomes in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. The Oncotype DX assay provides risk stratification for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) invasive breast cancer; however, the association of PR status and Oncotype DX recurrence scores (RSs) is less clear.
Methods
We designed an analysis to determine whether a significant difference exists in the RS for ER+/PR− tumors when compared with ER+/PR+ breast cancer. Three hundred and fifty patients with HR+ invasive breast cancer who underwent Oncotype DX testing at our institution from December 2006 to October 2013 were included. We also examined the concordance in the HR status reported by immunohistochemical (IHC) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. The data were analyzed by analysis of variance, F test, t test, and chi-square tests. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine significant predictors of Oncotype DX RS.
Results
A total of 301 patients had ER+/PR+ tumors and 47 patients had ER+/PR− tumors by IHC. PR− tumors had a significantly higher RS than PR+ tumors (24.7±8.53 vs. 17.3±7.38; p<.001), predicting a greater 10-year risk of distant recurrence. Multivariate linear regression showed PR status and tumor grade to be significant predictors of Oncotype DX RS (p<.0001). A total of 284 patients had HR status reported by Oncotype DX assay. Concordance between IHC and RT-PCR was 99.3% for ER and 88.7% for PR.
Conclusion
Our study shows that ER+/PR− breast cancer tumors are associated with a significantly higher Oncotype DX scores; this interprets into a higher risk of recurrence. Our data also show that the concordance between IHC and RT-PCR was 99.3% for ER and lower at 88.7% for PR.

Abstract: In this paper, graphite nanoparticles have been dispersed into a paraffin/water emulsion with the purpose of improving the thermal conductivity and photothermal conversion performance of the emulsion. The melting enthalpy and apparent specific heat of 20wt% paraffin/water emulsion is 39.2Jg−1 and 9.105Jg−1K−1 and its melting and freezing temperatures are very close to those of paraffin. Moreover, the 300 heating–cooling cycles test indicates that the paraffin/water emulsions containing 0.1wt% graphite exhibits good thermal reliability. The viscosities of all samples are lower than 0.0750Pas, meeting the transportablilty requirements in pump systems for applications. In addition, the thermal conductivity of the emulsion containing 0.1wt% graphite increases by 20.0% as compared to the base fluid and its receiver efficiency is higher than 86.0% as the temperature ranges from room temperature to 80°C. As a result, the paraffin/water emulsion containing graphite with high energy storage capacity, enhanced thermal conductivity and excellent photo-thermal performance, good thermal reliability and good fluidity shows great potential for use as advanced heat transfer fluid (HTF) in the low temperature applications of direct absorption solar collector (DASCs).

Abstract: Lattice matched and current matched GaAsP/SiGe tandem solar cells on Si have the potential of 40% conversion efficiency [8]. A corrected three-terminal tandem efficiency of 20.6% under 1× illumination has been achieved, a relative improvement of approximately 9% compared to the 18.9% efficiency reported previously. Current matching is realized under 2.1× illumination. This is achieved by improving the bottom cell structure, manipulating the bottom cell active area and adjusting the light spectrum during light IV measurements. This paper describes the design of the improved structure, a simplified fabrication process and a detailed current matching analysis of this tandem solar cell. Pathways to achieve the realistic efficiency of over 25% under 1× illumination and near 30% under 20× illumination are also discussed.

Abstract: Iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox electrolyte in hybrid electrochromic (EC) devices provides high charge capacity and thereby a high optical modulation can be achieved. However, its corrosive nature and absorption in UV and in blue range of light forming an unpleasant yellowish coloration limits smart window application. In this regard, tetramethylthiourea/tetramethylformaminium disulphide (TMTU/TMFDS2+), 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyl-oxy (TEMPO)/TEMPO+ and potassium ferrocyanide/potassium ferricyanide (K4[Fe(CN)6]/K3[Fe(CN)6]) are studied as alternative redox couples. Their characterisation is performed considering electrochemical and optical properties. The redox potential is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) is determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on sputtered and sol–gel tungsten trioxide (WO3), sol–gel titanium oxide (TiO2), fluorine doped tin oxide (F:SnO2) as well as on sputtered platinum (Pt). TMTU/TMFDS2+ has demonstrated an appropriate redox potential as well as a high charge transfer resistance on oxides and low on Pt layers for high bias potentials. Furthermore, the kinetics of the change in transmission of the EC devices is compared considering the loss current. The EC device comprising TMTU/TMFDS2+ exhibits excellent optical modulation in visual transmission from 71 down to 14% at −795mV within 5min.

Abstract: An effective light trapping method for substrate-type hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin film solar cells is the use of a back reflector (BR) of high roughness, e.g., ‘hot silver’, which is deposited at temperatures higher than 450°C. In this work, textured silver-aluminum (Ag–Al) BR films were fabricated by depositing Ag on Al film at Ag-deposition temperatures (TAg) ranging from 25 to 350°C. The surface morphology and roughness of Ag–Al films were strongly affected by TAg. The Al and Ag films were formed entirely of Ag2Al alloy at TAg of 330°C or higher, while the Ag–Al films maintained a double-layered structure at 290°C or below. Although the films did not undergo alloying at TAg of 290°C, the Ag–Al films have a well-developed surface structure with high diffuse-reflectance, compared to Ag films deposited at the same temperature. The conversion efficiency of an a-Si:H thin film solar cell on a flexible stainless steel substrate increased from 7.63% to 8.44% as TAg was increased from 25 to 290°C, as a result of more effective light scattering by Ag–Al BRs, producing increased short-circuit current. However, at higher TAg, Ag2Al alloy films with sharp crystallite edges were formed, and were not appropriate as BRs. The present work clearly shows that double-layered Ag–Al films fabricated at temperatures as low as 290°C could be useful back reflectors for substrate-type thin film solar cells.

Abstract: Instead of employing numerous binary quantum dots (QDs), engineering ternary alloyed ones has been emerging as a promising approach to tailor their optical and electronic properties. In this paper, composition-tunable CdSxSe1−x QDs have been explored and demonstrated to be efficient sensitizers for quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). The optical bandgap and the corresponding band edges could be varied by controlling the component ratios of the ternary QDs while keeping the particle size constant, and a moderate bandgap was attained to deliver broad light harvesting and ideal band alignment. The successful balance of these two requirements resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.58% for CdSxSe1−x QD-sensitized TiO2 solar cells. When the engineered CdSxSe1−x interlayer was further incorporated between CdS core and CdSe shell layers, a superior PCE of 5.06% has been reached for the graded CdS/CdSxSe1−x/CdSe structure, which appreciably outperforms the conventional CdS/CdSe one (η=4.41%). The incorporation of CdSxSe1−x interlayer offers two benefits, (1) the construction of a favorable stepwise band structure, facilitating desired charge injection, and (2) the passivation of the interfacial defects and interphase strain, contributing to suppressed charge recombination. This work highlights the broad prospect of ternary alloyed QDs for developing highly efficient QDSCs.

Abstract: Significant research has been pursued to develop solar selective metallic coatings using a variety of coating deposition techniques, with limited attempts to assess the properties of bulk metallic materials for solar energy applications. In developing bulk solar reflectors with good reflectance in the entire solar range, we report a new class of reflector materials based on Cu–Sn intermetallics with tailored substitution of aluminium or zinc. Our experimental results suggest that the arc melted–suction cast Cu (78.8at%)–Al (21.2at%) alloy with nanoscale surface roughness can exhibit a combination of 89% bulk specular reflectance and 83% bulk solar reflectance, together with a hardness of 2GPa. We show that the present alloy design approach paves the way for further opportunities of tuning the spectral properties of this new class of solar reflector material.

Abstract: Sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction have become the most common forms of sensory defects. Stem cell-based therapeutic strategies for curing hearing loss are being developed. Several attempts to develop hair cells by using chicken utricle stromal cells as feeder cells have resulted in phenotypic conversion of stem cells into inner ear hair-cell-like cells. Here, we induced the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into otic epithelial progenitors (OEPs), and further induced the differentiation of OEPs into hair-cell-like cells using different substrates. Our results showed that OEPs cultured on the chicken utricle stromal cells with the induction medium could differentiate into hair-cell-like cells with stereociliary bundles. Co-culture with stromal cells, however, may be problematic for subsequent examination of the induced hair-cell-like cells. In order to avoid the interference from stromal cells, we cultured OEPs on laminin with different induction media and examined the effects of the induction medium on the differentiation potentials of OEPs into hair-cell-like cells. The results revealed that the culture of OEPs on laminin with the conditioned medium from chicken utricle stromal cells supplemented with EGF and all-trans retinoic acid (RA) could promote the organization of cells into epithelial clusters displaying hair-cell-like cells with stereociliary bundles. These cells also displayed the expected electrophysiological properties.

Abstract: Due to its wide gap, WO3 mostly absorbs only the ultraviolet radiation, resulting into lower charge collection and thus necessitating the coupling (doping or sensitization) of WO3 with low band gap materials so as to achieve the photoexcitation and charge separation. This study reports the sensitization of WO3 films with ternary quantum dots (ZnCdSe) using SILAR technique for the first time. The porous WO3 layer was spray deposited using ammonium metatungstate as precursor. The structural, surface morphological and optical properties of the sensitized WO3 thin films were studied. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies of the sensitized films showed superior performance to that of unmodified WO3 films. Photocurrent density of 8.53mA/cm2 (at 0V vs Ag/AgCl) was observed for film sensitized with 9 cycles of SILAR deposition annealed at 400°C under nitrogen atmosphere, which is a 120-fold and 14-fold increase in photocurrent density when compared to unsensitized WO3 film and WO3/TiO2 film, respectively. Sensitization with ternary quantum dots as ZnCdSe thus offers two advantages: (i) the lower band gap of ZnCdSe allows it to absorb more energy and in turn produce more charge carriers and (ii) the conduction band of ZnCdSe, which lies above the conduction band of TiO2, results in a better charge transfer from sensitizer to the substrate material.

Abstract: We present a novel passivating contact structure based on a nanostructured silicon-based layer. Traditional poly-Si junctions feature excellent junction characteristics but their optical absorption induces current losses when applied to the solar cell front side. Targeting enhanced transparency, the poly-Si layer is replaced with a mixed-phase silicon oxide/silicon layer. This mixed-phase layer consists of an amorphous SiOx matrix with incorporated Si filaments connecting one side of the layer to the other, and is referred to as nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx) layer. We investigate passivation quality, measured as saturation current density, and nanostructural changes, characterized by Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, carefully studying the influence of annealing dwell temperature. Excellent surface passivation on n-type and also p-type wafers is shown. An optimum annealing temperature of 950°C is found, resulting in a saturation current density of 8.8fAcm−2 and 11.0fAcm−2 for n-type and p-type wafers, respectively. Even before forming gas annealing, emitter saturation current densities of 27.9 fA cm−2 (n+/n junction) and 32.0 fA cm−2 (n+/p junction) are reached. Efficient current extraction is presented with specific contact resistivities of 86mΩcm2 on n-type wafer and 19mΩcm2 on p-type wafers, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveals that the layer stack consists of intermixed SiOx and Si phases with the Si phases being partly crystalline already in the as-deposited state. Thermal annealing at temperatures ≥850°C further promotes crystallization of the Si-rich regions. The addition of the SiOx phase enhances the thermal stability of the contact and should allow to tune the refractive index and improve transparency, while still providing efficient electrical transport through the crystalline Si phase, which extends throughout almost the entire contact.

Abstract: Developing new materials with improved thermal stability is very important as far as the passivation and processing of crystalline silicon solar cells is considered. In this work, we studied two types of hydrogenated silicon based materials (hydrogenated amorphous silicon oxide and hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon oxide) and compared them to the well-established hydrogenated amorphous silicon. We demonstrate the thermal robustness of hydrogenated silicon oxide under anodic bonding conditions (250°C, 1000V). The microstructural and composition evolution of passivation layers under anodic bonding was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry. We found that oxygen can inhibit the degradation of the passivation quality under anodic bonding by suppressing the localized interfacial crystallization and re-passivating the interface. When applied to thin-film crystalline silicon solar cells, the excellent thermal robustness of hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon oxide allows to keep a good passivation to the ultrathin c-Si absorbers (1μm).

Abstract: We investigate the effect of doping on quantum dot (QD) solar cells by analysing their behavior in terms of photovoltaic characteristic, external quantum efficiency, and photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature. The analysis addresses the two most widespread methods for QD selective doping, namely modulation and direct doping, to gain a comprehensive device-level assessment of the impact of doping profile and density on the solar cell behavior. Devices are simulated using a physics-based model that accurately describes QD carrier dynamics within a semi-classical drift-diffusion-Poisson model. Different scenarios in terms of crystal quality are considered: in the high-quality material, close to radiative limit, large open circuit voltage recovery is predicted, due to the suppression of radiative recombination through QD ground state. In the defective material, significant photovoltage recovery is also attained owing to the suppression of both nonradiative and QD ground state radiative recombination. In both cases, PL emission from extended wetting layer states becomes dominant at high doping density. The interplay between nonradiative and QD radiative recombination channels, and how their interaction is modified by doping, are analyzed in detail. Strong influence on the cell behavior of unintentional background doping of interdot layers and markedly nonlinear behavior of open circuit PL with respect to excitation intensity are demonstrated. The resulting picture provides new insight on the experimental results in literature.

Abstract: The PbS quantum dot sensitized solar cells were prepared on 3-mercaptoproponic acid (MPA) anchored mesoporous TiO2 films by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process and the fabricated PbS q-dots were passivated by deposition of a CdS layer. In SILAR process, MPA solution was mixed with sulfide precursor solution and used it in every SILAR cycle for rapid conversion of Pb and Cd into their respective sulfides form. Performances of surface passivated and non-passivated PbS q-dot solar cells were compared where solar cells fabricated with q-dots of PbS, PbS/CdS, CdS showed best efficiencies (η) of 1.0, 5.7, 0.9% with current densities (Jsc) of 10.1, 22.8, 2.7mAcm−2 and open circuit voltages (Voc) of 280, 501, 498mV respectively. The enhanced efficiency of PbS/CdS q-dot solar cell was mainly due to increase in Jsc and Voc compared to PbS q-dot solar cells. The outstanding performance of PbS/CdS sensitized solar cell was found to be due to reduction of trap states in PbS particle by the surface passivation effect of CdS q-dots and the surface passivation effect of CdS in PbS/CdS sensitized solar cell is reported by EIS and voltage decay investigations.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by brain plaques of amyloid beta and by neuronal loss, but it is unclear how amyloid beta causes neuronal loss and how to prevent this loss. We have previously shown that amyloid beta causes neuronal loss by inducing microglia to phagocytose neurons, and here we investigated whether protein kinase Cs and NADPH oxidase were involved in this. The loss of neurons induced by amyloid beta in co-cultures of primary glia and neurons was completely prevented by inhibiting protein kinase Cs with Gö6976 or Gö6983. Directly activating protein kinase Cs with phorbol myristate acetate stimulated microglial phagocytosis, and induced neuronal loss mediated by MFG-E8/vitronectin receptor pathway of microglial phagocytosis. Blocking phagocytosis by MFG-E8 knockout or receptor inhibition left live neurons, indicating microglial phagocytosis was the cause of neuronal death. Phorbol myristate acetate stimulated the microglial NADPH oxidase, and inhibiting the oxidase prevented neuronal loss. A physiological activator of NADPH oxidase, fMLP, also induced neuronal loss dependent on microglia. Amyloid beta-induced neuronal loss was blocked by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, superoxide dismutase or Toll-like receptor function-blocking antibodies. The results indicate that amyloid beta induces microglial phagocytosis of neurons via activating protein kinase Cs and NADPH oxidase, and that activating the kinases or oxidase is sufficient to induce neuronal loss by microglial phagocytosis. Thus inhibiting protein kinase Cs or NADPH oxidase might be beneficial in Alzheimer’s disease or other brain pathologies involving inflammatory neuronal loss mediated by microglia.

Abstract: Solar reflectors for concentrating solar power (CSP) concentrators require a high specular reflectance over the whole solar spectrum. A preliminary procedure to measure the reflectance of solar mirror materials has been proposed in the SolarPaces reflectance measurement guideline [1]. However, the guideline clearly states that the currently available measurement instruments need further improvement in order to be able to fully characterize the reflectance properties of solar reflectors. In this work a high precision spectral reflectometer has been developed that permits the measurement of the solar weighted specular reflectance at different incidence and acceptance angles and thus provides all relevant reflectance data of solar mirrors. Four typical reflector materials have been measured and the solar weighted reflectance as a function of the acceptance angle has been modeled.

Abstract: Mitochondrial Targeting Sequences (MTSs) are responsible for trafficking nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria. Once entering the mitochondria, the MTS is recognized and cleaved off. Some MTSs are long and undergo two-step processing, as in the case of the human frataxin (FXN) protein (80aa), implicated in Friedreich's ataxia (FA). Therefore, we chose the FXN protein to examine whether nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins can efficiently be targeted via a heterologous MTS (hMTS) and deliver a functional protein into mitochondria. We examined three hMTSs; that of citrate synthase (cs), lipoamide deydrogenase (LAD) and C6ORF66 (ORF), as classically MTS sequences, known to be removed by one-step processing, to deliver FXN into mitochondria, in the form of fusion proteins. We demonstrate that using hMTSs for delivering FXN results in the production of 4–5-fold larger amounts of the fusion proteins, and at 4–5-fold higher concentrations. Moreover, hMTSs delivered a functional FXN protein into the mitochondria even more efficiently than the native MTSfxn, as evidenced by the rescue of FA patients’ cells from oxidative stress; demonstrating a 18%–54% increase in cell survival; and a 13%-33% increase in ATP levels, as compared to the fusion protein carrying the native MTS. One fusion protein with MTScs increased aconitase activity within patients’ cells, by 400-fold. The implications form our studies are of vast importance for both basic and translational research of mitochondrial proteins as any mitochondrial protein can be delivered efficiently by an hMTS. Moreover, effective targeting of functional proteins is important for restoration of mitochondrial function and treatment of related disorders.

Abstract: Screen printed front side contacts were investigated in n-type, high efficiency, single-crystalline Si solar cells with B doped emitters. Cells were processed identically and two different front side pastes were used: paste Ag–Al yielded efficiencies of 20.0%, and paste Ag, without Al, yielded 16.1% efficiency only. Cells contacted with paste Ag–Al yielded a continuous glass layer, a significantly higher density of Ag colloids, and an Al mole fraction of ∼1at%. In contrast, cells contacted with paste Ag revealed a thinner but continuous glass layer as compared to cells processed with paste Ag–Al. It contained a lower density of Ag colloids and Al was below the detection limit of the EDX microanalysis. In n-type cells pyramidal shaped Ag nanocrystals did not appear, whereas for p-type cells they are formed at intersections of differently {111} oriented surface planes at the Si emitter. We did not find Ag/Al spikes at the Si emitter for cells contacted with paste Ag–Al. Cells contacted with paste Ag–Al had a smaller series resistance as well as a significantly lower specific contact resistance (4mΩcm2). A higher series resistance and specific contact resistance >100mΩcm2 was found for cells contacted with paste Ag. It was concluded that the specific contact resistance decreases with increased wetting and increased density of Ag colloids in the glass layer. The series resistance of the Ag–Al alloy contact depended only weakly on temperature, whereas the series resistance linearly increased with temperature for contacts processed with paste Ag. p- and n-type cells with maximum efficiency yield a similar microstructure of the front side contact, similar series and contact resistance, respectively. A high density of Ag colloids in the glass layer was found for cells with low specific contact resistance. This suggests that also for n-type cells a three dimensional percolative charge transport through the glass layer is assisted by the presence of metallic Ag colloids.

Abstract: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an autoimmune disease in which the medium-sized blood vessels throughout the body become inflamed. The increased evidences showed that TNF-α was association with vascular inflammation in KD patients. However the detailed mechanism was still unclear. Recent studies indicated abnormal expressed long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) involved in many diseases. Thus the purpose of this study is to explore the role of lncRNAs in KD and find out the new target for KD treatment. In this study, firstly we verified the overexpressed TNF-α in KD patients, and found TNF-α was able to induce HUVECs apoptosis and inhibit HUVECs proliferation. After this we screened out pregnancy induced noncoding RNA (PINC) was significantly overexpression in TNF-α treated HUVECs. We also found PINC overexpressed in KD patients. For further study, we designed two siRNA of PINC. After silenced the expression of PINC in HUVECs, we found the Knockdown of PINC enhanced the viability of HUVECs treated with TNF-α, and increased the expression of anti-apoptotic and reduced the expression of apoptotic gene. These results suggest PINC involves in the process of TNF-α induces vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, it may become a new target for KD treatment.

Abstract: The miR-302 family is one of the main groups of microRNAs, which are highly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Previous reports have indicated that miR-302 can reduce the proliferation rate of some cancer cells while compromising on their oncogenic potential at the same time without having the same effect on normal somatic cells. In this study we aimed to further investigate the role of the miR-302 cluster in multiple cancer signaling pathways using A-375 melanoma and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells. Our results indicate that the miR-302 cluster has the potential to modulate oncogenic properties of cancer cells through inhibition of proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion, and through reversal of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in these cells. We showed for the first time that overexpression of miR-302 cluster sensitized A-375 and HT-29 cells to hypoxia and also to the selective BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib. MiR-302 is a pleiotropically acting miRNA family which may have significant implications in controlling cancer progression and invasion. It acts through a reprogramming process, which has a global effect on a multitude of cellular pathways and events. We propose that reprogramming of cancer cells by epigenetic factors, especially miRNAs might provide an efficient tool for controlling cancer and especially for those with more invasive nature.

Abstract: Polycrystalline cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-films are commonly annealed in an atmosphere containing oxygen and chlorine and this passivation is essential in order to establish high photovoltaic conversion efficiencies. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is employed to acquire two-dimensional (2D) chemical distributions of impurities in CdTe samples with a lateral resolution of ~150nm. A statistical methodology is developed to examine the ToF-SIMS data via a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This test is used to determine the degree of chemical segregation at the grain boundaries for chlorine, sulfur, oxygen and copper. Chlorine and oxygen are highly segregated at grain boundaries. Sulfur is found to slowly diffuse into the grain interior from the grain boundary and this process is accelerated with an increasing temperature during the chlorine heat treatment. The distribution of copper is found to be uniform in bi-crystalline and polycrystalline CdTe samples and, hence, it is concluded that within the sensitivities of the ToF-SIMS measurement, no segregation of copper at the grain boundary is detected.

Abstract: The influence of mixed maritime atmosphere on the degradation of metallic components of exposed solar thermal collectors was studied. Corrosion measurements of standard metal samples (unalloyed carbon steel, zinc, copper and aluminum) were performed according to ISO 9226/1992 and ISO 9223/2012 with two different test set-ups; one in the open atmosphere, the other inside a commercial flat-plate thermal collector. Moreover, the influence of defined microclimatic conditions inside the thermal collector on the durability of different absorber surfaces was investigated. The results show extremely high corrosion rates in the open atmosphere for all exposed metals in contrast to the samples inside the solar thermal collector, where high corrosivity was only detected for amorphous metals. The results of optical measurements of the exposed absorber samples show a very good stability of the materials. Additionally, different analytical methods were used for the characterization of corrosion products. This information can be used for the optimization of accelerated aging tests for absorber materials with respect to corrosive environment and salt content.

Abstract: Suppressor of variegation 3⿿9 homolog 1 (Suv39h1) is a histone methyltransferase that trimethylates lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3), which results in gene silencing. A previous study found that H3K9me3 and Suv39h1 were decreased in diabetic mouse vascular smooth muscle cells whereas Suv39h1 overexpression attenuated ischemic myocardial injury. Moreover, high glucose (HG) decreased H3K9me3 and Suv39h1 levels in some cells. Thus, we studied the roles of Suv39h1 in HG-induced effects in MES13 (mouse mesangial) cells. We found that HG, chaetocin (a Suv39h1 inhibitor) and Suv39h1 siRNA decreased Suv39h1 while increasing fibronectin and p21WAF1 protein levels. HG increased mRNA while chaetocin increased transcription of fibronectin and p21WAF1genes. Both HG and chaetocin decreased histone H3K9me3 levels at the promoters of fibronectin and p21WAF1 genes. Additionally, Suv39h1 overexpression attenuated HG-induced fibronectin and p21WAF1 mRNA and protein expressions while attenuating HG-induced cell hypertrophy. Suv39h1 overexpression also attenuated HG-suppressed histone H3K9me3 levels at the promoters of fibronectin and p21WAF1 genes. Moreover, LY294002 or the dominant-negative phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) mutant (οp85) attenuated HG-decreased Suv39h1 and HG-induced fibronectin and p21WAF1 protein expressions. We concluded that HG decreased Suv39h1 via the PI3K pathway in mesangial cells. Inhibition of Suv39h1 increased fibronectin and p21WAF1 expressions. Moreover, Suv39h1 overexpression attenuated HG-induced fibronectin and p21WAF1 expressions and cell hypertrophy while attenuating HG-suppressed histone H3K9me3 levels at the promoters of fibronectin and p21WAF1 genes.

Abstract: The material that is used in solar receivers is subjected to intense cyclic thermal stresses and extreme temperatures, which are directly dependent on the intermittence of the solar resource. These factors accelerate the ageing mechanisms and reduce the durability of the receivers because of a reduction of their thermal performance. This study presents guidelines to study the thermo-radiative properties of an absorber material that is subjected to a highly concentrated solar flux. The material was a square honeycomb SiCSi structure that is typically used in volumetric air receivers. Accelerated ageing tests were performed by means of crashing thermal treatments, in which the modulus and period of the incident flux and the boundary conditions of the material were varied. The reflectivity and absorptivity of the material were experimentally characterized before and after the thermal treatments. The measurements were performed using two different reflectometers, one monochromatic and one in the solar band; the latter can measure at ambient temperature or high temperature that is representative of the operational conditions (400–700°C). However, only the solar band reflectometer working at high temperature was able to detect the evolution of the thermo-radiative properties of the material, which highlights the important role of the temperature and the wavelength. Furthermore, the thermal treatments in which the samples were water-cooled and in which the solar flux was medial more quickly accelerated the ageing mechanism of the material and reduced its absorptivity.

Abstract: The conventional evaluation of photoluminescence (PL) images of inhomogeneous solar cells, which is based on the model of independent diodes, leads to systematic errors in the estimation of the local saturation current density J01. The Laplacian-based image evaluation, which was proposed already in 2009, does not rely on this model and has the potential to image J01 correctly. However, first applications of this method to PL images also have failed. In this work it is shown that this failing was due to the blurring effect occurring in the luminescence detector. If PL images are deconvoluted with the correct point spread function, the resulting images lead to the correct J01 distribution if evaluated by the Laplacian method.

UTX-1 regulates Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation via changing the methylated status of histone H3,

Abstract: Epigenetic modifications are thought to be important for gene expression changes during HIV-1 transcription and replication. The removal of histone H3 lysine27 (H3K27) trimethylation mark by UTX-1 is important for the robust induction of many specific genes during Tat-mediated HIV-1 transactvation. We found that UTX-1 enzymatic activity is needed for Tat to remove a repressive mark H3K27me3 in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). UTX-1 converted the chromatin structure to a more transcriptionally active state by up-regulation of H3K4 methylation and down-regulation of H3K27 methylation on the specific regions of HIV-1 LTR. The increase in H3K27me3 and the decrease in H3K4me3 induced by UTX-1 knockdown was detected on the HIV-1 LTR, but not by control siRNA. Additionally, UTX-1 promotes HIV-1 gene expression by enhancing both the NF-κB p65′s nuclear translocation and its p65 binding to HIV-1 LTR. And we further demonstrated that H3K27 demethylase activity was required for increased HIV-1 transactivation induced by UTX-1. Together, our data reveal key roles for UTX-1 in a timely transition from poised to active chromatin in HIV-1 LTR during HIV-1 transcription and a fundamental mechanism by which a H3K27 demethylase triggers tissue-specific chromatin changes. Our findings provide a mechanistic link between UTX-1 and enhanced HIV-1 replication, and suggest that targeting at epigenetic mechanism may have a therapeutic benefit for HIV-1 patients.

Abstract: This work investigates the photoluminescence properties of high transmission glass (HTG) doped with CeO2 and MnO as well as their capability to transform the solar spectrum by absorption/emission via energy transfer from Ce3+ to Mn2+ into a more efficient red-enhanced spectrum for traditional Si-based solar cells. We show that Mn3+ and Mn2+ centers are formed in HTG, their relative concentration depending on the heat treatment and the presence of other dopants like Ce3+. Co-doping with CeO2 aims to stabilize Mn2+ by avoiding Mn3+ formation. We investigate the possibility of energy transfer from UV-absorbing Ce3+ to Mn2+ as a way of enhancing the HTG capability for blue-UV to red light transformation. The solarization effect through the Mn2+/Mn3+ ratio is also investigated for different CeO2 concentrations by means of optical transmittance and emission/excitation spectroscopy. Following these results, we perform an analysis of the optically enriched HTG for photovoltaic applications.

Abstract: Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive correlation between daily increases in airborne particulate matter (PM) concentration and the occurrence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Transition metals present in air PM were associated with adverse health effects after PM exposure. The aim of this work was to study lung O2 metabolism after an acute exposure to transition metal-coated nanoparticles (NPs). Female Swiss mice (25g) were intranasally instilled with a suspension of silica NP containing Ni (II), Cd (II), Fe (III), or Cr (VI) at 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 1.0mg metal/kg body weight. Lung O2 consumption was found to be significantly increased after the exposure to most doses of Ni-NP and Fe-NP, and the 0.05mg metal/kg body weight dose of Cr-NP, while no changes were observed for Cd-NP. Lucigenin chemiluminescence (as an indicator of NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity) was evaluated in lung homogenates. Only Ni-NP and Fe-NP have shown the ability to induce a significant increase in lucigenin chemiluminescence. In order to establish the possible occurrence of pulmonary oxidative stress, TBARS levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio were determined. The higher doses of Ni-NP and Fe-NP were able to induce an oxidative stress condition, as shown by changes in both TBARS levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio. Taken together, the present results show differential effects for all the metals tested. These findings emphasize the importance of transition metals present air PM in PM adverse health effects, and contribute to the understanding of the pathological mechanisms triggered by the exposure to environmental PM.

Abstract: The manufacturing process of Passivated Emitter and Rear Totally diffused (PERT) solar cells on n-type crystalline silicon is significantly simplified by applying multifunctional layer stacks acting as diffusion source, etching and diffusion barrier. We apply boron silicate glasses (BSG) capped with silicon nitride (SiNz) layers that are deposited by means of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Optimum PECVD deposition parameters for the BSG layer such as the gas flow ratio of the precursor gases silane and diborane SiH4/B2H6=8% and the layer thickness of 40nm result in a boron diffusion with saturation current density J0,B below 10fA/cm2 applying an AlOx/SiNy passivation and firing. The PECVD BSG diffusion source is integrated into the n-type PERT back junction (BJ) solar cell process with screen-printed front and rear contacts. The only high temperature step is a POCl3 co-diffusion for the formation of the boron emitter from the PECVD BSG layer and for the formation of the phosphorus-doped front surface field (FSF). An independently confirmed energy conversion efficiency of 21.0% is achieved for a 156×156mm2 large n-PERT BJ cell with this simplified process flow. This is the highest efficiency reported for a large-area co-diffused n-type PERT BJ solar cell using a PECVD BSG as diffusion source. For comparison, reference n-type PERT BJ cells with separate POCl3 and BBr3 diffusions reach an efficiency of 21.2% in our lab. A synergistic efficiency gain analysis (SEGA) for the co-diffused n-PERT BJ cell shows that the main possible efficiency gain of 1.1%abs. originates from recombination in the phosphorus-diffused front surface field while the PECVD BSG boron-doped emitter accounts for only 0.1%abs. efficiency gain. We evaluate the use of the PECVD BSG/SiNz stack as a rear side passivation as a replacement of the AlOx/SiNy stack in order to further simplify the process flow. We obtain J0,B values of 40fA/cm2, an implied open-circuit voltage of 682mV and a simulated n-PERT BJ cell efficiency of 21.1%.

Tumour-necrosis factor-α induces heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatase 1 (Sulf-1) expression in fibroblasts,

Abstract: Heparan sulfate (HS) 6-O-endosulfatases (Sulfs) have emerged recently as critical regulators of many physiological and pathological processes. By removing 6-O-sulfates from specific HS sequences, they modulate the activities of a variety of growth factors and morphogens, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1. However, little is known about the functions of Sulfs in inflammation. Tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-α plays an important role in regulating the behaviour of fibroblasts. In this study, we examined the effect of this inflammatory cytokine on the expression of Sulfs in human MRC-5 fibroblasts. Compositional analysis of HS from TNF-α-treated cells showed a strong reduction in the amount of the trisulfated UA2S-GlcNS6S disaccharide, which suggested a selective reaction of 6-O-desulfation. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that TNF-α increased Sulf-1 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, via a mechanism involving NF-ĸB, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. In addition, we confirmed that cell stimulation with TNF-α was accompanied by the secretion of an active form of Sulf-1. To study the function of Sulf- 1, we examined the responses induced by FGF-1. We showed that ERK1/2 activation and cell proliferation were markedly reduced in TNF-α-treated MRC-5 cells compared with untreated cells. Silencing the expression of Sulf-1 by RNA interference restored the responses induced by FGF-1, which indicated that TNF-α-mediated induction of the sulfatase indeed resulted in alterations of HS biological properties. Taken together, our results indicate that Sulf-1 is responsive to TNF-α stimulation and may function as an autocrine regulator of fibroblast expansion in the course of an inflammatory response.

Abstract: In this study, we investigated the effect of potassium fluoride post-deposition treatment (KF-PDT) on Cu(In1-xGax)Se2 (CIGS) thin films and solar cells fabricated onto sodalime glass (SLG) substrates. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometery (SIMS) analysis showed that the K increased in the entire CIGS layer after KF-PDT, however Na seemed no change because of a large amount of K and Na diffused from SLG substrates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that the KF-PDT depleted Cu, whereas increased K and Ga at the near surface CIGS layer, before the rinsing process. Removal of native oxides from KF-treated CIGS thin film was observed based on rinsing solutions. Ammonia aqueous solution removed Ga compounds more efficiently from KF-treated CIGS thin film than that of distilled water. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) revealed that the carrier lifetime and PL intensity greatly increased after KF-PDT, resulting in the reduction of photo-generated carrier recombination. The Voc loss (Eg/q-Voc) decreased from 0.52 to around 0.44V for KF-treated CIGS solar cells with band gap (Eg) of 1.06–1.23eV. Electron beam-induced current (EBIC) analysis indicated that the effective carrier collection of the CIGS solar cells widened toward the Mo back-contact side after KF-PDT. This phenomenon could be attributed to the increase in carrier lifetime. C-V measurements suggested that KF-PDT not only increased hole concentration but also passivated bulk defects.

Abstract: Phagocytosis and the subsequent destruction of invading pathogens by macrophages are indispensable steps in host immune responses to microbial infections. Low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) has been found to exert photobiological effects on immune responses, but the signaling mechanisms underlying this photobiomodulation of phagocytosis remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that LPLI enhanced the phagocytic activity of macrophages by stimulating the activation of Rac1. The overexpression of constitutively activated Rac1 clearly enhanced LPLI-induced phagocytosis, whereas the overexpression of dominant negative Rac1 exerted the opposite effect. The phosphorylation of cofilin was involved in the effects of LPLI on phagocytosis, which was regulated by the membrane translocation and activation of Rac1. Furthermore, the photoactivation of Rac1 was dependent on the Src/PI3K/Vav1 pathway. The inhibition of the Src/PI3K pathway significantly suppressed LPLI-induced actin polymerization and phagocytosis enhancement. Additionally, LPLI-treated mice exhibited increased survival and a decreased organ bacterial load when challenged with Listeria monocytogenes, indicating that LPLI enhanced macrophage phagocytosis in vivo. These findings highlight the important roles of the Src/PI3K/Vav1/Rac1/cofilin pathway in regulating macrophage phagocytosis and provide a potential strategy for treating phagocytic deficiency via LPLI.

Abstract: Resistive oxide materials play an important role in the front contact of CdTe solar cells. The high-resistance transparent (HRT) or “buffer” layer has been used extensively in CdTe thin-film photovoltaics to enable a reduction in CdS thickness while maintaining near-maximum device voltage and fill factor. SnO2- and ZnO-based alloys were tested as HRT layers on a fluorine-doped tin oxide transparent conducting oxide. SnO2-based alloy HRT layers were deposited via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD). Alloying ZnO with MgO to create MgxZn1−xO (MZO) via radio-frequency sputter deposition was explored as a way to reduce the electron affinity of ZnO HRT layers. To fully understand the behavior of these materials, many devices were fabricated with either no CdS layer, a sublimated CdS layer, or a sputtered, oxygenated CdS layer. MZO layers resulted in high open-circuit voltage and device efficiency even with the complete elimination of the CdS layer. In both HRT systems, controlling electron affinity to optimize front contact band alignment is an important consideration. Band measurements using photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron techniques correlate band alignment measurements with efficiency parameters in the design of HRT and CdS layers.

Abstract: The application of spray coated silver nanowires (AgNWs) onto OPVs for building Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPVs) is demonstrated. By using AgNWs with PEDOT:PSS, a transparent conductive layer was demonstrated on top of an P3HT:PCBM active layer with a sheet resistance of 30Ω/⎕ for 90% transparency. This has been applied to two separate configurations; semi-transparent OPVs for solar glazing applications and OPVs onto an opaque substrate, namely steel. For the latter, a novel technique to planarise the steel substrate with an intermediate layer is also presented, with a substantial decrease in surface roughness reported to ensure that the substrate is smooth enough to use for OPV fabrication. The use of SU-8 as an intermediate layer reduced the surface roughness to RA=10nm, which is one of the lowest values reported to date, and was achieved on a low cost substrate (DC01 low carbon steel) using solution processing.

Niclosamide inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor growth in lapatinib-resistant human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer,

Abstract: Acquired resistance to lapatinib, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 kinase inhibitor, remains a clinical problem for women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced breast cancer, as metastasis is commonly observed in these patients. Niclosamide, an anti-helminthic agent, has recently been shown to exhibit cytotoxicity to tumor cells with stem-like characteristics. This study was designed to identify the mechanisms underlying lapatinib resistance and to determine whether niclosamide inhibits lapatinib resistance by reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Here, two human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer cell lines, SKBR3 and BT474, were exposed to increasing concentrations of lapatinib to establish lapatinib-resistant cultures. Lapatinib-resistant SKBR3 and BT474 cells exhibited up-regulation of the phenotypic epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers Snail, vimentin and α-smooth muscle actin, accompanied by activation of nuclear factor-кB and Src and a concomitant increase in stem cell marker expression (CD44high/CD24low), compared to naive lapatinib-sensitive SKBR3 and BT474 cells, respectively. Interestingly, niclosamide reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition, induced apoptosis and inhibited cell growth by perturbing aberrant signaling pathway activation in lapatinib-resistant human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive cells. The ability of niclosamide to alleviate stem-like phenotype development and invasion was confirmed. Collectively, our results demonstrate that lapatinib resistance correlates with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and that niclosamide inhibits lapatinib-resistant cell viability and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These findings suggest a role of niclosamide or derivatives optimized for more favorable bioavailability not only in reversing lapatinib resistance but also in reducing metastatic potential during the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer.

Abstract: Thioredoxin-1 maintains the cellular redox status and decreases the infarct size in ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, whether the increase of thioredoxin-1 expression or its lack of activity modifies the protection conferred by ischemic postconditioning has not been yet elucidated. The aim was to evaluate if the thioredoxin-1 overexpression enhances the posctconditioning protective effect, and whether the lack of the activity abolishes the reduction of the infarct size. Wild type mice hearts, transgenic mice hearts overexpressing thioredoxin-1, and a dominant negative mutant (C32S/C35S) of thioredoxin-1 were used. The hearts were subjected to 30min of ischemia and 120min of reperfusion (Langendorff) (I/R group) or to postconditioning protocol (PostC group). The infarct size in the Wt-PostC group decreased in comparison to the Wt-I/R group (54.6±2.4 vs. 39.2±2.1%, p<0.05), but this protection was abolished in DN-Trx1-PostC group (49.7±1.1%). The ischemia/reperfusion and postconditioning in mice overexpressing thioredoxin-1 reduced infarct size at the same magnitude (35.9±2.1 and 38.4±1.3%, p<0.05 vs. Wt-I/R). In Wt-PostC, Trx1-I/R and Trx1- PostC, Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation increased compared to Wt-I/R, without changes in DN-Trx1 groups. In conclusion, given that the cardioprotection conferred by thioredoxin-1 overexpression and postconditioning, is accomplished through the activation of the Akt/GSK3β survival pathway, no synergic effect was evidenced. Thioredoxin-1 plays a key role in the postconditioning, given that when this protein is inactive the cardioprotective mechanism was abolished. Thus, diverse comorbidities or situations modifying the thioredoxin activity, could explain the absence of this strong mechanism of protection in different clinical situations.

Abstract: A novel route that fabricate Cu2ZnSnS4 solar cells by a combustion method has been successfully conducted. The probable formation mechanism of Cu2ZnSnS4 for metal oxides system during the sulfurization process is analyzed in detail through the phase analysis in several continuous temperature ranges in combination with thermodynamic calculation. The effects of annealing temperature on the structural, morphological, compositional and optical properties of absorber layer were studied. The UV–vis spectra revealed the band gap of as-prepared thin films varying from 1.48 to 1.34eV along with rising the sulfurization temperature. It was found that secondary phase with narrow band gap significantly affects the band gap of Cu2ZnSnS4. The best performance of the Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film solar cells prepared by the combustion method achieved a powder conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.6% with a short circuit current density of 10.5mA/cm2 and an open circuit voltage of 505mV. This low-cost non-vacuum technique has a promising application in synthesis of light-absorbing layers for photovoltaic devices, which can vastly reduce the costs and simplify the preparation process.

Abstract: We have developed a simple and robust process to prepare efficient perovskite solar cells. Pinhole free thin films of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx can be coated on high conductivity poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), (Clevios PH1000) when the PEDOT:PSS is deposited together with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and Zonyl as additives. This process enables the fabrication of perovskite solar cells using [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as electron transport layer with >12% power conversion efficiency, low hysteresis and excellent operational stability. We have performed a detailed opto-electronic characterization of these solar cells and identified the main loss mechanism limiting the device performance.

Abstract: Earth-abundant Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin film photovoltaic absorber layers are fabricated by annealing Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanoparticle thin films in a selenium rich atmosphere. Systematic variation of the selenization time (5, 10, 20 and 40min) and temperature (450, 500, 550 and 600°C) provides insight into the kinetics of the selenization process and in particular recrystallization and grain growth. Se–S anion exchange is found to follow Avrami׳s model in which the CZTS selenization is controlled by an irregular one-dimensional process limited by metal cation re-ordering and grain boundary migration. CZTSSe grain growth is observed to follow a normal relation with a grain growth exponent close to the ideal case of equiaxed grains and the grain boundary migration energy is calculated to be 85.38kJ/mol. These selenization variables have a fundamental influence on the quality of the resulting CZTSSe thin film and consequently the device performance. A peak device solar energy conversion efficiency of 5.4% was obtained for selenization at 500°C for 20min. The device efficiency was found to be highly sensitive to these variables and it is critical to obtain an appropriate balance between grain growth and thin film quality.

Abstract: A previous report has shown that a chimera between a platinum complexing agent (1) and the cell penetrating peptide maurocalcin, synthesized with D-amino acids, (DMCa), termed Pt-1-DMCa, is a highly successful anticancer compound that works by targeting the intracellular redox system in glioblastoma (GBM) cells. However, the detailed cellular mechanism whereby the conjugate specifically kills tumor cells remains unclear. Herein, we show that Pt-1-DMCa induces apoptosis in Human U87 GBM cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent modulation of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO3a signalling pathway. First, we found that Pt-1-DMCa treatment of these cells induces inhibition of AKT and nuclear accumulation of FoxO3a thereby facilitating transcription of the target genes Bim and PTEN. Modulation of the AKT/FoxO3a/Bim signaling pathway by RNA interference confirms that these signaling events are critical for Pt-1-DMCa-induced apoptosis of U87 GBM cells. Furthermore, we reveal that FoxO3a-mediated up-regulation of PTEN exerts an additional inhibitory effect on the AKT survival pathway. Thus, our results demonstrate that the conjugate can induce ROS-dependent FoxO3a-mediated apoptosis in U87 cells through PTEN-mediated inhibition of the PI3K/AKT survival axis. Our results help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Pt-1-DMCa-induced cell death in U87 GBM cells and support a theoretical basis for future applications of the MCa peptide.

Abstract: Solar-powered consumer electronics are a likely starting point for organic photovoltaic (OPV) market development. Therefore, a generic discrete choice experiments study can determine how Flemish consumers value solar-cell characteristics for solar-powered consumer electronics. Such characteristics include efficiency, lifetime, aesthetics, integratability, and price. We contribute to the literature by investigating preference heterogeneity in a solar-power niche market with an experimental design with a fixed reference alternative. The error components random parameter logit (ECRPL) with interactions provides a better fit than the latent class (LC) model for our choice data. The main effects had the expected signs. Consequently, aesthetics and integratability are OPV's assets. Nevertheless, heterogeneity puts the results that are valid for the average consumer into perspective. Based on our findings, OPV commercialization efforts should target the experienced, impatient user who highly values design and functionality.

Abstract: Recent research has shown the use of solar thermoelectric generators (STEG) to be an alternative method of harnessing solar energy. They comprise of a spectrally selective absorber coupled to thermoelectric materials to generate power as governed by the Seebeck effect. Since output power generated is dependent on thermal gradient in the STEG, it is important to maximize this parameter. This can be done by increasing energy absorbed from the sun and minimizing energy lost from the system. Herein, the former has been achieved using thermal concentration by area while the latter has been addressed by use of a vacuum enclosure. The effect of varying enclosure pressure on convective heat loss from the solar selective substrate (α=0.90, ε=0.15, area: 22.4cm×12cm) was studied. It was observed that at 100mbar enclosure pressure, convective heat transfer coefficient as low as 0.6W/m2°C (cf., 10W/m2°C at atmospheric pressure) was obtained. This resulted in the rise of substrate temperature from 97°C at ambient pressure to 142°C at 100mbar enclosure pressure, an observation validated by simulations. Further study was conducted where open circuit voltage (OCV) and output power were observed and efficiency was calculated at different enclosure pressures. In these tests the effect of using a large area absorber was also studied. It was observed that decreasing the enclosure pressure increased the OCV, output power and efficiency of the STEG setup. It was also noted that using a large surface area absorber further increased the OCV and output power of the setup. During the course of the study, a maximum OCV of 823mV, output power of 44.2mW, and an efficiency of 0.82% were achieved by the setup at an enclosure pressure of 100mbar and thermal concentration ratio of 22. The results show that the present setup may be used as an alternative to optically concentrated STEGs which require a power consuming solar tracking system.

Abstract: We report on evaluation of effective carrier lifetimes of Si nanowires, which were selectively grown inside nanochannels of anodic aluminum oxide template using gas source molecule beam epitaxy. The carrier lifetime measurements were conducted under different injection level of irradiated photons at wavelength of 349nm. It was found that anodic aluminum oxide template functioned not only as a mechanical guide of Si nanowires but also as an efficient passivation material. The effective carrier lifetime increased from 39 to 65.8μs upon postdeposition anneal of 400°C. Furthermore, thermal treatment at 650°C could enhance the excited carriers to diffuse inside Si substrate and yielded a promising effective carrier lifetime of 152μs. The Si nanowires embedded with anodic aluminum oxide templates are proved to be as potential candidate for fabrication of high efficiency solar cells.

Abstract: Autophagy modulation has been considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for lung diseases. The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway may be one of the main targets for regulation of autophagy. We previously reported that a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor PF-04691502 suppressed hepatoma cells growth in vitro. However, it is still unclear whether PF-04691502 induces autophagy and its roles in DNA damage and cell death in human lung cancer cells. In this study, we investigate the effects of PF-04691502 on the autophagy and its correlation with cell apoptosis and DNA damage in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. PF-04691502 efficiently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity in A549 and H1299 cells. PF-04691502 also triggered apoptosis and the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. Phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX), a hallmark of DNA damage response, was dramatically induced by PF-04691502 treatment. By exposure to PF-04691502, A549 cells acquired a senescent-like phenotype with an increase in the level of β-galactosidase. Furthermore, PF-04691502 enhanced the expression of LC3-II in a concentration-dependent manner. More interestingly, effects of PF-04691502 on toxicity and DNA damage were remarkably increased by co-treatment with an autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ), in human lung cancer cells. These data suggest that a strategy of blocking autophagy to enhance the activity of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors warrants further attention in treatment of NSCLC cells.

Abstract: Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) could intercalate between the side-chains of poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (pBTTT) creating a stable co-crystal structure, so optimal solar cell performance was obtained at high PC71BM concentrations promoting phase separated electron conductive pathways. Neutron reflectivity, with the application of magnetic contrast variation, was used to investigate the concentration profile of PC71BM within the active layer. And this profile was found to be homogeneous through the film thickness. Small angle neutron scattering was utilized to find there is amorphous PC71BM even at 50wt% of fullerene while previously it was believed that all fullerene was consumed to form co-crystals when its concentration is below 75wt%. These fullerene molecules evolve into approximately 15nm sized agglomerates to improve the electron transport when their concentration is above 75wt%. Thermal annealing gives these agglomerates mobility to form micrometer sized crystals causing a decrease of device performance. These findings can therefore correlate the morphology, especially in terms of fullerene agglomerates, vertical concentration profile and percolating structure they formed, with the device performance and provide valuable guidance for optimal morphology design of polymer: fullerene solar cells.

Abstract: Concentrated solar power (CSP) generation is becoming a very important player within the renewable energy sector thanks to increased introduction of these facilities into the conventional electricity market. CSP plants become dispatchable when integrating thermal energy storage (TES) systems which allow electricity production at any time of the year. Sensible TES using nitrate salts mixtures as storage fluid are the most extended arrangement for commercial CSP facilities. In addition to storage time, dimensions, thermal-mechanical requirements, among others, corrosion compatibility between high temperature nitrate salts, and structural materials is a key factor to take into consideration for the final storage system design. Many scientific contributions have been developed regarding metallic alloys corrosion performance in nitrate salts at laboratory scale. Accordingly, lack of technical background is identified about nitrates corrosion in relevant operation conditions. Therefore, a corrosion testing device (CTD) was designed to evaluate corrosion behavior of structural materials inside high temperature nitrate salts storage tanks in operation. Furthermore, A516 Gr70 carbon steel was evaluated at different exposures times by using the CTD in the TES-PS10 pilot plant. Results reported within this study show the feasibility of the CTD to be used at commercial scale allowing corrosion preventive maintenance practices and materials selection optimization. Moreover, A516 Gr70 carbon steel displayed an excellent corrosion performance after nitrate salts exposure being recommended for long time service under continuous and intermittent exposure to nitrate salts. In addition to low corrosion rates, carbon steel generated protective and well adhered iron oxide layers without significant localized phenomena. Finally, negligible susceptibility to crevice and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) phenomena is showed by carbon steel under test conditions.

Abstract: This study investigated the influence of Mo:Na on the formation of MoSe2 in Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cells and its overall effect on the performance of cells with a structure of Ti/Mo:Na/Mo/CIGS/CdS/i-ZnO/ZnOAl/Al. Varying the thickness of the Mo:Na layer enabled the systematic control of the diffusion of Na into the CIGS layer. Experimental results demonstrate that the thickness of MoSe2 phase decreases with an increase in the thickness of the Mo:Na layer. Reducing the thickness of the MoSe2 layer enhanced cell efficiency. Additionally, Ga distribution in the CIGS layer may vary with a change in the thickness of the Mo:Na layer. When Mo:Na/Mo=500/500nm, the Ga content and the thickness of the MoSe2 layer were close to optimal with regard to cell performance. This paper proposes a model to explain the impact of Na doping on the formation of MoSe2 phase formation in polycrystalline CIGS. It appears that the addition of Na leads to the formation of Na2Sex at the grain boundaries in the absorber layer, which reduces the diffusion of Se to form MoSe2.

Abstract: Emerging evidence suggests that activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy gauge and redox sensor, delays aging process. However, the molecular mechanisms by which AMPKα isoform regulates cellular senescence remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine if AMPKα deletion contributes to the accelerated cell senescence by inducing p16INK4A (p16) expression thereby arresting cell cycle. The markers of cellular senescence, cell cycle proteins, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were monitored in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from wild type (WT, C57BL/6J), AMPKα1, or AMPKα2 homozygous deficient (AMPKα1−/−, AMPKα2−/−) mice by Western blot and cellular immunofluorescence staining, as well as immunohistochemistry (IHC) in skin tissue of young and aged mice. Deletion of AMPKα2, the minor isoform of AMPKα, but not AMPKα1 in high-passaged MEFs led to spontaneous cell senescence demonstrated by accumulation of senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining and foci formation of heterochromatin protein 1 homolog gamma (HP1γ). It was shown here that AMPKα2 deletion upregulates cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p16, which arrests cell cycle. Furthermore, AMPKα2 null cells exhibited elevated ROS production. Interestingly, knockdown of HMG box-containing protein 1 (HBP1) partially blocked the cellular senescence of AMPKα2-deleted MEFs via the reduction of p16. Finally, dermal cells senescence, including fibroblasts senescence evidenced by the staining of p16, HBP1, and Ki-67, in the skin of aged AMPKα2−/− mice was enhanced when compared with that in wild type mice. Taken together, our results suggest that AMPKα2 isoform plays a fundamental role in anti-oxidant stress and anti-senescence.

Abstract: The study of solar cells subjected to reverse biasing is of fundamental importance since the reliability of an entire solar panel can be influenced by the presence of leakage paths on a single solar cell. The particular situation of reverse biasing can occur when, in a module, a solar cell is shadowed and the illuminated solar cells force the generated current through the shadowed solar cell that is reverse biased. The situation is further aggravated by the fact that reverse current crowds in localized shunt paths (“hot spots”) that are related to the presence of semiconductor defects. In this biasing condition the shadowed solar cell acts as a load and it can dissipate tens of watts with the risk of high temperature and damaging of the encapsulating materials. In this paper we study the effects of reverse biasing on metal wrap through (MWT) solar cells. This cell structure is particularly sensitive to reverse-bias, due to the presence of via holes in the junction. The presence of “hot spots” can be related to the through hole metallization pattern: this leads to the conclusion that the MWT production process may strongly affect the reliability of this technology and should be optimized to avoid the formation of parasitic reverse current paths in the crystal structure.

Abstract: Increasing insights into the operational features of experimental solar cells, particularly the effects of spatial variations arising from material quality fluctuations or device design features, are being made possible by advanced characterisation technologies, such as luminescent imaging. A widely used two-dimensional model of solar cells underpinning the interpretation of such effects consists of a network of distributed elemental solar cells connected by resistive elements. This model is refined to account rigorously for lateral carrier and photon flows in the cell bulk by incorporation of a network of pseudo-current sources. An example of the use of the new model is given by analysing the lateral injection effect due to voltage variation along the emitter under operating conditions. The derived results not only provide a more general insight into such a lateral injection mechanism, but also reveal the impact on luminescent imaging.

Abstract: Next-generation solar power conversion systems in concentrating solar power (CSP) applications require high-temperature advanced fluids in the range of 600–800°C. Current commercial CSP plants use molten nitrate salt mixtures as the heat transfer fluid and the thermal energy storage (TES) media while operating with multiple hours of energy capacity and at temperatures lower than 565°C. At higher temperatures, the nitrates cannot be used because they decompose. Molten chloride salts are candidates for CSP applications because of their high decomposition temperatures and good thermal properties; but they can be corrosive to common alloys used in vessels, heat exchangers, and piping at these elevated temperatures. In this article, we present the results of the corrosion evaluations of several alloys in eutectic 34.42wt% NaCl – 65.58wt% LiCl at 650–700°C in nitrogen atmosphere. Electrochemical evaluations were performed using open-circuit potential followed by a potentiodynamic polarization sweep. Corrosion rates were determined using Tafel slopes and Faraday's law. A temperature increase of as little as 50°C more than doubled the corrosion rate of AISI stainless steel 310 and Incoloy 800H compared to the initial 650°C test. These alloys exhibited localized corrosion. Inconel 625 was the most corrosion-resistant alloy with a corrosion rate of 2.80±0.38mm/year. For TES applications, corrosion rates with magnitudes of a few millimeters per year are not acceptable because of economic considerations. Additionally, localized corrosion (intergranular or pitting) can be catastrophic. Thus, corrosion-mitigation approaches are required for advanced CSP plants to be commercially viable.

Our previous work suggests that decline in serum PON-1 activities, i.e. arylesterase and paraoxonase, might be associated with the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) or vascular dementia (VAD). The present study aimed to: (1) expand our previous findings in a larger and different population, including patients with LOAD-VAD mixed dementia (MD); (2) explore a possible association between PON-1 and multiple sclerosis (MS); (3) evaluate if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of PON-1 activities might be useful biomarkers for MS. We found that serum arylesterase, but not paraoxonase, levels of PON-1 were significantly lower in patients affected by MCI (n=232), VAD (n=65), LOAD (n=175), MD (n=88) as well as those with MS (n=104) as compared to healthy controls. Notably, the most pronounced decline in this activity was shown by MD (−18%, p<0.01) and MS (−23%, p<0.001), while the lowest changes were detected in the MCI group (11%, p<0.05). Only arylesterase was detectable in the CSF of MS patients and the levels were not significantly different from those detected in the other two neurological control groups. Overall our data suggest that a depressed arylesterase activity could be a common denominator of different neurological diseases which, independently of their peculiar ethiopathogenesis and pathophysiology, appear to be all characterized by an altered systemic redox balance.

Abstract: The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of a commercial scale photovoltaics (PV) system is quantitatively investigated. The impact of the system and financial parameters, the installed system cost, solar insolation, system lifetime, system derate losses, module cost, module efficiency, balance of system (BOS) cost, inflation, discount rate, and loan rate, are quantitatively calculated using the System Advisor Model (SAM) from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). 3D contour plots are generated to assess the impact of the key system and financial parameters on the LCOE. Calculations show that an installed system cost of 2.8, 2.3, and 2.1$/W can provide an LCOE of ~10¢/kWh (average price of electricity in the US) in Phoenix, Atlanta, and Boston, respectively, for a 30 years system lifetime, 20% system derate losses without investment tax credit (ITC). In addition, contour plots are generated to show what happens to the LCOE if the above parameters change. The study uses reasonable inputs for the current (2015) commercial scale PV system in the US.

Abstract: This paper provides an analysis of the benefits of passive cooling for High Concentrator Photovoltaic (HCPV) systems in terms of costs and kWh annual energy yields. For the first time, the performance of the heat sinks has been related to the calculated energy yield of a standard triple-junction GaInP/GaAs/Ge HCPV cell in a system deployed at several suitable locations across the globe. Copper and aluminium heat sinks have been considered and their merits have been compared. The finite element analysis software package COMSOL was employed to gain insights regarding a simple flat plate heat sink. The cell temperature was found to have a linear dependence on the geometric concentration with a characteristic slope that increases with cell size (ranging from 10 to 0.25mm). The results show the advantages of miniaturisation, and that the cooling of smaller cells can be accomplished using flat heat sinks. Within the considered range of geometric concentration ratios (up to 1000×), aluminium heat sinks are, in general, found to be preferred over copper, because of their lower densities and costs for the same thermal management. Closed-form thermal models based on the Least-Material (LM) approach have been utilised to design more complex finned heat sinks (operated under natural convection) that yield the best compromise between thermal performance and weight. For a 60°C cell operating temperature, a greater kWh output is obtained, but an LM heat sink designed for a cell temperature of 80°C has a material cost per unit energy that is between 50% and 70% less than the one designed for 60°C. Heat sink costs between $0.1 and 0.9 per Wp were estimated for a geometric concentration above 500suns, depending on the cell׳s temperature and size. There are strong reductions in HCPV installation costs by limiting the dimensions of the cooling system at high concentrations.

Abstract: We present arguments that additional effects besides laterally homogenous tunnelling might occur in carrier-selective poly-Si/c-Si junctions: (i) the symmetrical electrical behaviour of n+ and p+ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, (ii) direct observation of structural modifications of the interfacial oxide upon thermal treatment by transmission electron microscopy, even for poly-Si/c-Si junctions with good passivation quality, and (iii) the achievement of low junction resistances even for interfacial oxide thicknesses >2nm after thermal treatment. We present an alternative picture, essentially based on a localized current flow through the interfacial oxide, mediated either by local reduction of the oxide layer thickness or by pinholes. In consequence, the local current flow implies transport limitations for both minority and majority carriers in the c-Si absorber, and thus a correlation between recombination current and series resistance. Thus, a poly-Si/c-Si junction can also be explained within the framework of a classical pn junction picture for a passivated, locally contacted emitter, e.g. by the model of Fischer. Both electron selective contacts (n+ poly-Si) and hole selective contacts (p+ poly-Si) can be described consistently when using reasonable input parameters. Especially for p+ poly-Si/c-Si junctions, our model could guideline further improvement.
