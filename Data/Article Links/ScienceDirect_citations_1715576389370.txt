Abstract: Summary
Mammalian sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) regulates a spectrum of vital biological processes and has long been implicated in the progression of cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of SIRT6 in tumorigenesis remain elusive. Here, we report that the tumor-suppressive function of SIRT6 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is regulated by acetylation. Specifically, males absent on the first (MOF) acetylates SIRT6 at K128, K160, and K267, resulting in a decreased deacetylase activity of SIRT6 and attenuated SIRT6 tumor-suppressive function in NSCLC. Mechanistically, MOF-mediated SIRT6 acetylation hinders the interaction between SIRT6 and transcriptional factor FOXA2, which in turn leads to the transcriptional activation of ZEB2, thus promoting NSCLC progression. Collectively, these data indicate an acetylation-dependent mechanism that modulates SIRT6 tumor-suppressive function in NSCLC. Our findings suggest that the MOF-SIRT6-ZEB2 axis may represent a promising therapeutic target for the management of NSCLC.
Keywords: SIRT6, MOF, acetylation, NSCLC, ZEB2, FOXA2

Abstract: Summary
Glucose metabolism is known to orchestrate oncogenesis. Whether glucose serves as a signaling molecule directly regulating oncoprotein activity for tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here, we report that glucose is a cofactor binding to methyltransferase NSUN2 at amino acid 1–28 to promote NSUN2 oligomerization and activation. NSUN2 activation maintains global m5C RNA methylation, including TREX2, and stabilizes TREX2 to restrict cytosolic dsDNA accumulation and cGAS/STING activation for promoting tumorigenesis and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy resistance. An NSUN2 mutant defective in glucose binding or disrupting glucose/NSUN2 interaction abolishes NSUN2 activity and TREX2 induction leading to cGAS/STING activation for oncogenic suppression. Strikingly, genetic deletion of the glucose/NSUN2/TREX2 axis suppresses tumorigenesis and overcomes anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy resistance in those cold tumors through cGAS/STING activation to facilitate apoptosis and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Our study identifies NSUN2 as a direct glucose sensor whose activation by glucose drives tumorigenesis and immunotherapy resistance by maintaining TREX2 expression for cGAS/STING inactivation.

Abstract: Summary
In bacteria, archaea, protists, and plants, the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) by inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) can, under stress conditions, substitute for ATP-driven proton flux to generate a proton gradient and induce luminal acidification. However, this strategy is considered to be lost in eukaryotes. Here, we report that LHPP, a poorly understood PPase that exhibits activity at acidic pH, is primarily expressed in astrocytes and partly localized on lysosomal membranes. Under stress conditions, LHPP is recruited to vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and facilitates V-ATPase-dependent proton transport and lysosomal acidification by hydrolyzing PPi. LHPP knockout (KO) mice have no discernable phenotype but are resilient to chronic-stress-induced depression-like behaviors. Mechanistically, LHPP deficiency prevents lysosome-dependent degradation of C/EBPβ and induces the expression of a group of chemokines that promote adult neurogenesis. Together, these findings suggest that LHPP is likely to be a therapeutic target for stress-related brain disease.

Abstract: Summary
Stable isotopes are powerful tools to assess metabolism. 13C labeling is detected using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or mass spectrometry (MS). MS has excellent sensitivity but generally cannot discriminate among different 13C positions (isotopomers), whereas NMR is less sensitive but reports some isotopomers. Here, we develop an MS method that reports all 16 aspartate and 32 glutamate isotopomers while requiring less than 1% of the sample used for NMR. This method discriminates between pathways that result in the same number of 13C labels in aspartate and glutamate, providing enhanced specificity over conventional MS. We demonstrate regional metabolic heterogeneity within human tumors, document the impact of fumarate hydratase (FH) deficiency in human renal cancers, and investigate the contributions of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle turnover and CO2 recycling to isotope labeling in vivo. This method can accompany NMR or standard MS to provide outstanding sensitivity in isotope-labeling experiments, particularly in vivo.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates metabolism and cell growth in response to nutrient levels. Dysregulation of mTORC1 results in a broad spectrum of diseases. Glucose is the primary energy supply of cells, and therefore, glucose levels must be accurately conveyed to mTORC1 through highly responsive signaling mechanisms to control mTORC1 activity. Here, we report that glucose-induced mTORC1 activation is regulated by O-GlcNAcylation of Raptor, a core component of mTORC1, in HEK293T cells. Mechanistically, O-GlcNAcylation of Raptor at threonine 700 facilitates the interactions between Raptor and Rag GTPases and promotes the translocation of mTOR to the lysosomal surface, consequently activating mTORC1. In addition, we show that AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of Raptor suppresses Raptor O-GlcNAcylation and inhibits Raptor-Rags interactions. Our findings reveal an exquisitely controlled mechanism, which suggests how glucose coordinately regulates cellular anabolism and catabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding morphogenesis strongly relies on the characterization of tissue topology and mechanical properties deduced from imaging data. The development of new imaging techniques offers the possibility to go beyond the analysis of mostly flat surfaces and image and analyze complex tissue organization in depth. An important bottleneck in this field is the need to analyze imaging datasets and extract quantifications not only of cell and tissue morphology but also of the cytoskeletal network’s organization in an automatized way. Here, we describe a method, called DISSECT, for DisPerSE (Discrete Persistent Structure Extractor)-based Segmentation and Exploration of Cells and Tissues, that offers the opportunity to extract automatically, in strongly deformed epithelia, a precise characterization of the spatial organization of a given cytoskeletal network combined with morphological quantifications in highly remodeled three-dimensional (3D) epithelial tissues. We believe that this method, applied here to Drosophila tissues, will be of general interest in the expanding field of morphogenesis and tissue biomechanics.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocytes, the liver’s predominant cells, perform numerous essential biological functions. However, crucial events and regulators during hepatocyte maturation require in-depth investigation. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to explore the precise hepatocyte development process in mice. We defined three maturation stages of postnatal hepatocytes, each of which establishes specific metabolic functions and exhibits distinct proliferation rates. Hepatic zonation is gradually formed during hepatocyte maturation. Hepatocytes or their nuclei with distinct ploidies exhibit zonation preferences in distribution and asynchrony in maturation. Moreover, by combining gene regulatory network analysis with in vivo genetic manipulation, we identified critical maturation- and zonation-related transcription factors. This study not only delineates the comprehensive transcriptomic profiles of hepatocyte maturation but also presents a paradigm to identify genes that function in the development of hepatocyte maturation and zonation by combining genetic manipulation and measurement of coordinates in a single-cell developmental trajectory.

Abstract: Summary
While many patients are treated beyond progression (TBP), the magnitude and duration of clinical benefit in these patients have not been fully quantified. Data from 799 patients with melanoma (n = 176), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; n = 146), gastric cancer (GC; n = 87), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC; n = 112), clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC; n = 51), and urothelial carcinoma (UC; n = 227) TBP were included. Patients had received pembrolizumab beyond confirmed progressive disease (PD) per RECIST v1.1. A subset of patients displays a 30% reduction in the sum of lesion diameters in the post-progression period (melanoma 24.4%, NSCLC 11.6%, 12.6% GC, 8.9% HNSCC, 15.7% ccRCC, and 13.2% UC). Most patients show stable target lesion dynamics in the post-progression period (melanoma, 64.8%; NSCLC, 72.6%; GC, 69.0%, 75.9% HNSCC, 72.5% ccRCC, 75.3% UC). Pembrolizumab generates meaningful efficacy in a subset of patients treated beyond RECIST v1.1 progression.

Abstract: Summary
Long-term memories are stored as configurations of neuronal ensembles, termed engrams. Although investigation of engram cell properties and functionality in memory recall has been extensive, less is known about how engram cells are affected by forgetting. We describe a form of interference-based forgetting using an object memory behavioral paradigm. By using activity-dependent cell labeling, we show that although retroactive interference results in decreased engram cell reactivation during recall trials, optogenetic stimulation of the labeled engram cells is sufficient to induce memory retrieval. Forgotten engrams may be reinstated via the presentation of similar or related environmental information. Furthermore, we demonstrate that engram activity is necessary for interference to occur. Taken together, these findings indicate that retroactive interference modules engram expression in a manner that is both reversible and updatable. Inference may constitute a form of adaptive forgetting where, in everyday life, new perceptual and environmental inputs modulate the natural forgetting process.

Abstract: Summary
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is regarded as a pandemic that affects about a quarter of the global population. Recently, host-gut microbiota metabolic interactions have emerged as distinct mechanistic pathways implicated in the development of NAFLD. Here, we report that a group of gut microbiota-modified bile acids (BAs), hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) species, are negatively correlated with the presence and severity of NAFLD. HDCA treatment has been shown to alleviate NAFLD in multiple mouse models by inhibiting intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and upregulating hepatic CYP7B1. Additionally, HDCA significantly increased abundances of probiotic species such as Parabacteroides distasonis, which enhances lipid catabolism through fatty acid-hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling, which in turn upregulates hepatic FXR. These findings suggest that HDCA has therapeutic potential for treating NAFLD, with a unique mechanism of simultaneously activating hepatic CYP7B1 and PPARα.

Abstract: Summary
In yeast meiosis, autophagy is active and essential. Here, we investigate the fate of Rim4, a meiosis-specific RNA-binding protein (RBP), and its associated transcripts during meiotic autophagy. We demonstrate that Rim4 employs a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to enter the nucleus, where it loads its mRNA substrates before nuclear export. Upon reaching the cytoplasm, active autophagy selectively spares the Rim4-mRNA complex. During meiotic divisions, autophagy preferentially degrades Rim4 in an Atg11-dependent manner, coinciding with the release of Rim4-bound mRNAs for translation. Intriguingly, these released mRNAs also become vulnerable to autophagy. In vitro, purified Rim4 and its RRM-motif-containing variants activate Atg1 kinase in meiotic cell lysates and in immunoprecipitated (IP) Atg1 complexes. This suggests that the conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of Rim4 are involved in stimulating Atg1 and thereby facilitating selective autophagy. Taken together, our findings indicate that autophagy surveils Rim4-mRNA interaction to ensure stage-specific translation during meiosis.

Abstract: Summary
Maximizing the production of heterologous biomolecules is a complex problem that can be addressed with a systems-level understanding of cellular metabolism and regulation. Specifically, growth-coupling approaches can increase product titers and yields and also enhance production rates. However, implementing these methods for non-canonical carbon streams is challenging due to gaps in metabolic models. Over four design-build-test-learn cycles, we rewire Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for growth-coupled production of indigoidine from para-coumarate. We explore 4,114 potential growth-coupling solutions and refine one design through laboratory evolution and ensemble data-driven methods. The final growth-coupled strain produces 7.3 g/L indigoidine at 77% maximum theoretical yield in para-coumarate minimal medium. The iterative use of growth-coupling designs and functional genomics with experimental validation was highly effective and agnostic to specific hosts, carbon streams, and final products and thus generalizable across many systems.

Abstract: Summary
Although many novel gene-metabolite and gene-protein associations have been identified using high-throughput biochemical profiling, systematic studies that leverage human genetics to illuminate causal relationships between circulating proteins and metabolites are lacking. Here, we performed protein-metabolite association studies in 3,626 plasma samples from three human cohorts. We detected 171,800 significant protein-metabolite pairwise correlations between 1,265 proteins and 365 metabolites, including established relationships in metabolic and signaling pathways such as the protein thyroxine-binding globulin and the metabolite thyroxine, as well as thousands of new findings. In Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, we identified putative causal protein-to-metabolite associations. We experimentally validated top MR associations in proof-of-concept plasma metabolomics studies in three murine knockout strains of key protein regulators. These analyses identified previously unrecognized associations between bioactive proteins and metabolites in human plasma. We provide publicly available data to be leveraged for studies in human metabolism and disease.

Abstract: Summary
Cortical neuron-astrocyte communication in response to peripheral sensory stimulation occurs in a topographic-, frequency-, and intensity-dependent manner. However, the contribution of this functional interaction to the processing of sensory inputs and consequent behavior remains unclear. We investigate the role of astrocytes in sensory information processing at circuit and behavioral levels by monitoring and manipulating astrocytic activity in vivo. We show that astrocytes control the dynamic range of the cortical network activity, optimizing its responsiveness to incoming sensory inputs. The astrocytic modulation of sensory processing contributes to setting the detection threshold for tactile and thermal behavior responses. The mechanism of such astrocytic control is mediated through modulation of inhibitory transmission to adjust the gain and sensitivity of responding networks. These results uncover a role for astrocytes in maintaining the cortical network activity in an optimal range to control behavior associated with specific sensory modalities.

Abstract: Aim
The study aimed to evaluate the differentiation ability of intravitreally injected rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBM-MSCs) to retinal ganglion-like cells in a polystyrene microsphere induced rat glaucoma model.
Materials and Methods
The glaucoma rat model was generated via intracameral injection of 7 microliter polystyrene microspheres. Green fluorescence protein-labeled (GFP) rBM-MSCs were transplanted intravitreally at or after induction of ocular hypertension (OHT), depending on the groups. By the end of the fourth week, flat-mount retinal dissection was performed, and labeled against Brn3a, CD90, GFAP, CD11b, Vimentin, and localization of GFP positive rBM-MSCs was used for evaluation through immunofluorescence staining and to count differentiated retinal cells by flow cytometry. From 34 male Wistar albino rats, 56 eyes were investigated.
Results
Flow cytometry revealed significantly increased CD90 and Brn3a positive cells in glaucoma induced and with rBM-MSC injected groups compared to control(P = 0.006 and P = 0.003 respectively), sham-operated (P = 0.007 and P < 0.001 respectively), and only rBM-MSCs injected groups (P = 0.002 and P = 0.009 respectively). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed differentiation of GFP labeled stem cells to various retinal cells, including ganglion-like cells. rBM-MSCs were observable in ganglion cells, inner and outer nuclear retinal layers in rBM-MSCs injected eyes.
Conclusion
Intravitreally transplanted rBM-MSCs differentiated into retinal cells, including ganglion-like cells, which successfully created a glaucoma model damaged with polystyrene microspheres. Promisingly, MSCs may have a role in neuro-protection and neuro-regeneration treatment of glaucoma in the future.

Abstract: Summary
Brain metastasis of lung cancer causes high mortality, but the exact mechanisms underlying the metastasis remain unclear. Here we report that vascular pericytes derived from CD44+ lung cancer stem cells (CSCs) in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) potently cause brain metastases through the G-protein-coupled receptor 124 (GPR124)-enhanced trans-endothelial migration (TEM). CD44+ CSCs in perivascular niches generate the majority of vascular pericytes in lung ADC. CSC-derived pericyte-like cells (Cd-pericytes) exhibit remarkable TEM capacity to effectively intravasate into the vessel lumina, survive in the circulation, extravasate into the brain parenchyma, and then de-differentiate into tumorigenic CSCs to form metastases. Cd-pericytes uniquely express GPR124 that activates Wnt7-β-catenin signaling to enhance TEM capacity of Cd-pericytes for intravasation and extravasation, two critical steps during tumor metastasis. Furthermore, selective disruption of Cd-pericytes, GPR124, or the Wnt7-β-catenin signaling markedly reduces brain and liver metastases of lung ADC. Our findings uncover an unappreciated cellular and molecular paradigm driving tumor metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic variants affecting gene expression levels in humans have been mapped in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Trans-acting variants impacting many genes simultaneously through a shared transcription factor (TF) are of particular interest. Here, we developed a generalized linear model (GLM) to estimate protein-level TF activity levels in an individual-specific manner from GTEx RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles. It uses observed differential gene expression after TF perturbation as a predictor and, by analyzing differential expression within pairs of neighboring genes, controls for the confounding effect of variation in chromatin state along the genome. We inferred genotype-specific activities for 55 TFs across 49 tissues. Subsequently performing genome-wide association analysis on this virtual trait revealed TF activity quantitative trait loci (aQTLs) that, as a set, are enriched for functional features. Altogether, the set of tools we introduce here highlights the potential of genetic association studies for cellular endophenotypes based on a network-based multi-omics approach. The transparent peer review record is available.

Abstract: Summary
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an encephalitic alphavirus responsible for epidemics of neurological disease across the Americas. Low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain-containing 3 (LDLRAD3) is a recently reported entry receptor for VEEV. Here, using wild-type and Ldlrad3-deficient mice, we define a critical role for LDLRAD3 in controlling steps in VEEV infection, pathogenesis, and neurotropism. Our analysis shows that LDLRAD3 is required for efficient VEEV infection and pathogenesis prior to and after central nervous system invasion. Ldlrad3-deficient mice survive intranasal and intracranial VEEV inoculation and show reduced infection of neurons in different brain regions. As LDLRAD3 is a determinant of pathogenesis and an entry receptor required for VEEV infection of neurons of the brain, receptor-targeted therapies may hold promise as countermeasures.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin accessibility fundamentally governs gene expression and biological response programs that can be manipulated by pathogens. Here we capture dynamic chromatin landscapes of individual B cells during Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV+ cells that exhibit arrest via antiviral sensing and proliferation-linked DNA damage experience global accessibility reduction. Proliferative EBV+ cells develop expression-linked architectures and motif accessibility profiles resembling in vivo germinal center (GC) phenotypes. Remarkably, EBV elicits dark zone (DZ), light zone (LZ), and post-GC B cell chromatin features despite BCL6 downregulation. Integration of single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq), single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data enables genome-wide cis-regulatory predictions implicating EBV nuclear antigens (EBNAs) in phenotype-specific control of GC B cell activation, survival, and immune evasion. Knockouts validate bioinformatically identified regulators (MEF2C and NFE2L2) of EBV-induced GC phenotypes and EBNA-associated loci that regulate gene expression (CD274/PD-L1). These data and methods can inform high-resolution investigations of EBV-host interactions, B cell fates, and virus-mediated lymphomagenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The central amygdala (CeA) with its medial (CeM) and lateral (CeL) nuclei is the brain hub for processing stimuli with emotional context. CeL nucleus gives a strong inhibitory input to the CeM, and this local circuitry assigns values (positive or negative) to incoming stimuli, guiding appropriate behavior (approach or avoid). However, the particular involvement of CeA in processing such emotionally relevant information and adaptations of the CeA circuitry are not yet well understood. In this study, we examined synaptic plasticity in the CeA after exposure to two types of rewards, pharmacological (cocaine) and natural (sugar). We found that both rewards engage CeM, where they generate silent synapses resulting in the strengthening of the network. However, only cocaine triggers plasticity in the CeL, which leads to the weakening of its excitatory inputs. Finally, chemogenetic inhibition of CeM attenuates animal preference for sugar, while activation delays cocaine-induced increase in locomotor activity.

Abstract: Summary
Many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are in non-coding regions. Therefore, QTLs are assumed to affect gene regulation. Gene expression and RNA splicing are primary steps of transcription, so DNA variants changing gene expression (eVariants) or RNA splicing (sVariants) are expected to significantly affect phenotypes. We quantify the contribution of eVariants and sVariants detected from 16 tissues (n = 4,725) to 37 traits of ∼120,000 cattle (average magnitude of genetic correlation between traits = 0.13). Analyzed in Bayesian mixture models, averaged across 37 traits, cis and trans eVariants and sVariants detected from 16 tissues jointly explain 69.2% (SE = 0.5%) of heritability, 44% more than expected from the same number of random variants. This 69.2% includes an average of 24% from trans e-/sVariants (14% more than expected). Averaged across 56 lipidomic traits, multi-tissue cis and trans e-/sVariants also explain 71.5% (SE = 0.3%) of heritability, demonstrating the essential role of proximal and distal regulatory variants in shaping mammalian phenotypes.

Abstract: Summary
How the essential eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT assembles from eight distinct subunits into a unique double-ring architecture remains undefined. We show TRiC assembly involves a hierarchical pathway that segregates subunits with distinct functional properties until holocomplex (HC) completion. A stable, likely early intermediate arises from small oligomers containing CCT2, CCT4, CCT5, and CCT7, contiguous subunits that constitute the negatively charged hemisphere of the TRiC chamber, which has weak affinity for unfolded actin. The remaining subunits CCT8, CCT1, CCT3, and CCT6, which comprise the positively charged chamber hemisphere that binds unfolded actin more strongly, join the ring individually. Unincorporated late-assembling subunits are highly labile in cells, which prevents their accumulation and premature substrate binding. Recapitulation of assembly in a recombinant system demonstrates that the subunits in each hemisphere readily form stable, noncanonical TRiC-like HCs with aberrant functional properties. Thus, regulation of TRiC assembly along a biochemical axis disfavors the formation of stable alternative chaperonin complexes.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin accessibility is integral to the process by which transcription factors (TFs) read out cis-regulatory DNA sequences, but it is difficult to differentiate between TFs that drive accessibility and those that do not. Deep learning models that learn complex sequence rules provide an unprecedented opportunity to dissect this problem. Using zygotic genome activation in Drosophila as a model, we analyzed high-resolution TF binding and chromatin accessibility data with interpretable deep learning and performed genetic validation experiments. We identify a hierarchical relationship between the pioneer TF Zelda and the TFs involved in axis patterning. Zelda consistently pioneers chromatin accessibility proportional to motif affinity, whereas patterning TFs augment chromatin accessibility in sequence contexts where they mediate enhancer activation. We conclude that chromatin accessibility occurs in two tiers: one through pioneering, which makes enhancers accessible but not necessarily active, and the second when the correct combination of TFs leads to enhancer activation.

Abstract: Summary
Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common microbe on human skin and has beneficial functions in the skin microbiome. However, under conditions of allergic inflammation, the abundance of S. epidermidis increases, establishing potential danger to the epidermis. To understand how this commensal may injure the host, we investigate phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) peptides produced by S. epidermidis that are similar to peptides produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Synthetic S. epidermidis PSMs induce expression of host defense genes and are cytotoxic to human keratinocytes. Deletion mutants of S. epidermidis lacking these gene products support these observations and further show that PSMs require the action of the EcpA bacterial protease to induce inflammation when applied on mouse skin with an intact stratum corneum. The expression of PSMδ from S. epidermidis is also found to correlate with disease severity in patients with atopic dermatitis. These observations show how S. epidermidis PSMs can promote skin inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Inspiration is the inexorable active phase of breathing. The brainstem pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) gives rise to inspiratory neural rhythm, but its underlying cellular and ionic bases remain unclear. The long-standing “pacemaker hypothesis” posits that the persistent Na+ current (INaP) that gives rise to bursting-pacemaker properties in preBötC interneurons is essential for rhythmogenesis. We tested the pacemaker hypothesis by conditionally knocking out and knocking down the Scn8a (Nav1.6 [voltage-gated sodium channel 1.6]) gene in core rhythmogenic preBötC neurons. Deleting Scn8a substantially decreases the INaP and abolishes bursting-pacemaker activity, which slows inspiratory rhythm in vitro and negatively impacts the postnatal development of ventilation. Diminishing Scn8a via genetic interference has no impact on breathing in adult mice. We argue that the Scn8a-mediated INaP is not obligatory but that it influences the development and rhythmic function of the preBötC. The ubiquity of the INaP in respiratory brainstem interneurons could underlie breathing-related behaviors such as neonatal phonation or rhythmogenesis in different physiological conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Crossovers (COs), the exchange of homolog arms, are required for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. Studies in yeast have described the single-end invasion (SEI) intermediate: a stabilized 3′ end annealed with the homolog as the first detectible CO precursor. SEIs are thought to differentiate into double Holliday junctions (dHJs) that are resolved by MutLgamma (MLH1/MLH3) into COs. Currently, we lack knowledge of early steps of mammalian CO recombination or how intermediates are differentiated in any organism. Using comprehensive analysis of recombination in thirteen different genetic conditions with varying levels of compromised CO resolution, we infer CO precursors include asymmetric SEI-like intermediates and dHJs in mouse. In contrast to yeast, MLH3 is structurally required to differentiate CO precursors into dHJs. We verify conservation of aspects of meiotic recombination and show unique features in mouse, providing mechanistic insight into CO formation.

Abstract: Summary
Structural and functional deficits in brain connectivity are reported in patients with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), but whether and how prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) affects axonal development of neurons and disrupts wiring between brain regions is unknown. Here, we develop a mouse model of moderate alcohol exposure during prenatal brain wiring to study the effects of PAE on corpus callosum (CC) development. PAE induces aberrant navigation of interhemispheric CC axons that persists even after exposure ends, leading to ectopic termination in the contralateral cortex. The neuronal miR-17-5p and its target ephrin type A receptor 4 (EphA4) mediate the effect of alcohol on the contralateral targeting of CC axons. Thus, altered microRNA-mediated regulation of axonal guidance may have implications for interhemispheric cortical connectivity and associated behaviors in FASD.

Abstract: Summary
Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are an increasing threat to global health. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway is considered the main antiviral immune pathway of insects, but its effective impact on arbovirus transmission is surprisingly poorly understood. Here, we use CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing in vivo to mutate Dicer2, a gene encoding the RNA sensor and key component of the siRNA pathway. The loss of Dicer2 enhances early viral replication and systemic viral dissemination of four medically significant arboviruses (chikungunya, Mayaro, dengue, and Zika viruses) representing two viral families. However, Dicer2 mutants and wild-type mosquitoes display overall similar levels of vector competence. In addition, Dicer2 mutants undergo significant virus-induced mortality during infection with chikungunya virus. Together, our results define a multifaceted role for Dicer2 in the transmission of arboviruses by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and pave the way for further mechanistic investigations.

Abstract: Summary
Lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, a subset of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), play an essential role in the formation of secondary lymphoid tissues. However, the regulation of the development and functions of this ILC subset is still elusive. In this study, we report that the transcription factor T cell factor 1 (TCF-1), just as GATA3, is indispensable for the development of non-LTi ILC subsets. While LTi cells are still present in TCF-1-deficient mice, the organogenesis of Peyer’s patches (PPs), but not of lymph nodes, is impaired in these mice. LTi cells from different tissues have distinct gene expression patterns, and TCF-1 regulates the expression of lymphotoxin specifically in PP LTi cells. Mechanistically, TCF-1 may directly and/or indirectly regulate Lta, including through promoting the expression of GATA3. Thus, the TCF-1-GATA3 axis, which plays an important role during T cell development, also critically regulates the development of non-LTi cells and tissue-specific functions of LTi cells.

Abstract: Summary
Meiotic crossovers are required for the faithful segregation of homologous chromosomes and to promote genetic diversity. However, it is unclear how crossover formation is regulated, especially on the XY chromosomes, which show a homolog only at the tiny pseudoautosomal region. Here, we show that ATF7IP2 is a meiosis-specific ortholog of ATF7IP and a partner of SETDB1. In the absence of ATF7IP2, autosomes show increased axis length and more crossovers; however, many XY chromosomes lose the obligatory crossover, although the overall XY axis length is also increased. Additionally, meiotic DNA double-strand break formation/repair may also be affected by altered histone modifications. Ultimately, spermatogenesis is blocked, and male mice are infertile. These findings suggest that ATF7IP2 constraints autosomal axis length and crossovers on autosomes; meanwhile, it also modulates XY chromosomes to establish meiotic sex chromosome inactivation for cell-cycle progression and to ensure XY crossover formation during spermatogenesis.

Abstract: Infection by Toxoplasma gondii may compromise the intestinal histoarchitecture through the tissue reaction triggered by the parasite. Thus, this study evaluated whether treatment with rosuvastatin modifies duodenal changes caused by the chronic infection induced by cysts of T. gondii. For this, female Swiss mice were distributed into infected and treated group (ITG), infected group (IG), group treated with 40 mg/kg rosuvastatin (TG) and control group (CG). After 72 days of infection, the animals were euthanized, the duodenum was collected and processed for histopathological analysis. We observed an increase in immune cell infiltration in the IG, TG and ITG groups, with injury to the Brunner glands. The infection led to a reduction in collagen fibers and mast cells. Infected and treated animals showed an increase in collagen fibers, acidic mucin-producing goblet cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes and mast cells, in addition to the reduction of muscle, neutral mucin-producing and Paneth cells. While treatment with rosuvastatin alone led to increased muscle layer, proportion of neutral mucin-producing goblet cells, Paneth cells, and reduction of collagen fibers. These findings indicate that the infection and treatment caused changes in the homeostasis of the intestinal wall and treatment with rosuvastatin potentiated most parameters indicative of inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Lineage plasticity is a form of therapy-induced drug resistance. In prostate cancer, androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors potentially lead to the accretion of tumor relapse with loss of AR signaling and a shift from a luminal state to an alternate program. However, the molecular and signaling mechanisms orchestrating the development of lineage plasticity under the pressure of AR-targeted therapies are not fully understood. Here, a survey of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) identifies ROR2 as the top upregulated RTK following AR pathway inhibition, which feeds into lineage plasticity by promoting stem-cell-like and neuronal networks. Mechanistically, ROR2 activates the ERK/CREB signaling pathway to modulate the expression of the lineage commitment transcription factor ASCL1. Collectively, our findings nominate ROR2 as a potential therapeutic target to reverse the ENZ-induced plastic phenotype and potentially re-sensitize tumors to AR pathway inhibitors.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosome chains fold and self-associate to form higher-order structures whose internal organization is unknown. Here, cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) of native human chromatin reveals intrinsic folding motifs such as (1) non-uniform nucleosome stacking, (2) intermittent parallel and perpendicular orientations of adjacent nucleosome planes, and (3) a regressive nucleosome chain path, which deviates from the direct zigzag topology seen in reconstituted nucleosomal arrays. By examining the self-associated structures, we observed prominent nucleosome stacking in cis and anti-parallel nucleosome interactions, which are consistent with partial nucleosome interdigitation in trans. Histone citrullination strongly inhibits nucleosome stacking and self-association with a modest effect on chromatin folding, whereas the reconstituted arrays undergo a dramatic unfolding into open zigzag chains induced by histone citrullination. This study sheds light on the internal structure of compact chromatin nanoparticles and suggests a mechanism for how epigenetic changes in chromatin folding are retained across both open and condensed forms.

Abstract: Summary
The intricate interplay between gut microbes and the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover remarkable similarities between CD4+ T cells in the spinal cord and their counterparts in the small intestine. Furthermore, we unveil a synergistic relationship between the microbiota, particularly enriched with the tryptophan metabolism gene EC:1.13.11.11, and intestinal cells. This symbiotic collaboration results in the biosynthesis of kynurenic acid (KYNA), which modulates the recruitment and aggregation of GPR35-positive macrophages. Subsequently, a robust T helper 17 (Th17) immune response is activated, ultimately triggering the onset of EAE. Conversely, modulating the KYNA-mediated GPR35 signaling in Cx3cr1+ macrophages leads to a remarkable amelioration of EAE. These findings shed light on the crucial role of microbial-derived tryptophan metabolites in regulating immune responses within extraintestinal tissues.

Abstract: Summary
To understand how a bacterium ultimately succeeds or fails in adapting to a new host, it is essential to assess the temporal dynamics of its fitness over the course of colonization. Here, we introduce a human-derived commensal organism, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt), into the guts of germ-free mice to determine whether and how the genetic requirements for colonization shift over time. Combining a high-throughput functional genetics assay and transcriptomics, we find that gene usage changes drastically during the first days of colonization, shifting from high expression of amino acid biosynthesis genes to broad upregulation of diverse polysaccharide utilization loci. Within the first week, metabolism becomes centered around utilization of a predominant dietary oligosaccharide, and these changes are largely sustained through 6 weeks of colonization. Spontaneous mutations in wild-type Bt also evolve around this locus. These findings highlight the importance of considering temporal colonization dynamics in developing more effective microbiome-based therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Lon is a widely distributed AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) protease known for degrading poorly folded and damaged proteins and is often classified as a weak protein unfoldase. Here, using a Lon-degron pair from Mesoplasma florum (MfLon and MfssrA, respectively), we perform ensemble and single-molecule experiments to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning MfLon function. Notably, we find that MfLon unfolds and degrades stably folded substrates and that translocation of these unfolded polypeptides occurs with a ∼6-amino-acid step size. Moreover, the time required to hydrolyze one ATP corresponds to the dwell time between steps, indicating that one step occurs per ATP-hydrolysis-fueled “power stroke.” Comparison of MfLon to related AAA+ enzymes now provides strong evidence that HCLR-clade enzymes function using a shared power-stroke mechanism and, surprisingly, that MfLon is more processive than ClpXP and ClpAP. We propose that ample unfoldase strength and substantial processivity are features that contribute to the Lon family’s evolutionary success.

Abstract: Summary
Synapsins cluster synaptic vesicles (SVs) to provide a reserve pool (RP) of SVs that maintains synaptic transmission during sustained activity. However, it is unclear how synapsins cluster SVs. Here we show that either liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) or tetramerization-dependent cross-linking can cluster SVs, depending on whether a synapse is excitatory or inhibitory. Cell-free reconstitution reveals that both mechanisms can cluster SVs, with tetramerization being more effective. At inhibitory synapses, perturbing synapsin-dependent LLPS impairs SV clustering and synchronization of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release, while preventing synapsin tetramerization does not. At glutamatergic synapses, the opposite is true: synapsin tetramerization enhances clustering of glutamatergic SVs and mobilization of these SVs from the RP, while synapsin LLPS does not. Comparison of inhibitory and excitatory transmission during prolonged synaptic activity reveals that synapsin LLPS serves as a brake to limit GABA release, while synapsin tetramerization enables rapid mobilization of SVs from the RP to sustain glutamate release.

Abstract: Summary
A wealth of specialized cell populations within the skin facilitates its hair-producing, protective, sensory, and thermoregulatory functions. How the vast cell-type diversity and tissue architecture develops is largely unexplored. Here, with single-cell transcriptomics, spatial cell-type assignment, and cell-lineage tracing, we deconstruct early embryonic mouse skin during the key transitions from seemingly uniform developmental precursor states to a multilayered, multilineage epithelium, and complex dermal identity. We identify the spatiotemporal emergence of hair-follicle-inducing, muscle-supportive, and fascia-forming fibroblasts. We also demonstrate the formation of the panniculus carnosus muscle (PCM), sprouting blood vessels without pericyte coverage, and the earliest residence of mast and dendritic immune cells in skin. Finally, we identify an unexpected epithelial heterogeneity within the early single-layered epidermis and a signaling-rich periderm layer. Overall, this cellular and molecular blueprint of early skin development—which can be explored at https://kasperlab.org/tools—establishes histological landmarks and highlights unprecedented dynamic interactions among skin cells.

Abstract: Summary
Cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) are key regulatory proteins of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization. Cohesin extrudes DNA loops that are anchored by CTCF in a polar orientation. Here, we present direct evidence that CTCF binding polarity controls cohesin-mediated DNA looping. Using single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that a critical N-terminal motif of CTCF blocks cohesin translocation and DNA looping. The cryo-EM structure of the cohesin-CTCF complex reveals that this CTCF motif ahead of zinc fingers can only reach its binding site on the STAG1 cohesin subunit when the N terminus of CTCF faces cohesin. Remarkably, a C-terminally oriented CTCF accelerates DNA compaction by cohesin. DNA-bound Cas9 and Cas12a ribonucleoproteins are also polar cohesin barriers, indicating that stalling may be intrinsic to cohesin itself. Finally, we show that RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) block cohesin-mediated DNA compaction in vitro and are enriched with cohesin subunits in vivo, likely forming TAD boundaries.

Abstract: Summary
Proper localization of receptors for synaptic organizing factors is crucial for synapse formation. Wnt proteins promote synapse assembly through Frizzled (Fz) receptors. In hippocampal neurons, the surface and synaptic localization of Fz5 is regulated by neuronal activity, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here, we report that all Fz receptors can be post-translationally modified by S-acylation and that Fz5 is S-acylated on three C-terminal cysteines by zDHHC5. S-acylation is essential for Fz5 localization to the cell surface, axons, and presynaptic sites. Notably, S-acylation-deficient Fz5 is internalized faster, affecting its association with signalosome components at the cell surface. S-acylation-deficient Fz5 also fails to activate canonical and divergent canonical Wnt pathways. Fz5 S-acylation levels are regulated by the pattern of neuronal activity. In vivo studies demonstrate that S-acylation-deficient Fz5 expression fails to induce presynaptic assembly. Our studies show that S-acylation of Frizzled receptors is a mechanism controlling their localization and function.

Abstract: Summary
Overly strong fear memories can cause pathological conditions. Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) has been viewed as an optimal drug target for CNS disorders, but its role in fear memory remains elusive. We find that a selective deficit of H3R in cholinergic neurons, but not in glutamatergic neurons, enhances freezing level during contextual fear memory retrieval without affecting cued memory. Consistently, genetically knocking down H3R or chemogenetically activating cholinergic neurons in the ventral basal forebrain (vBF) mimics this enhanced fear memory, whereas the freezing augmentation is rescued by re-expressing H3R or chemogenetic inhibition of vBF cholinergic neurons. Spatiotemporal regulation of H3R by a light-sensitive rhodopsin-H3R fusion protein suggests that postsynaptic H3Rs in vBF cholinergic neurons, but not presynaptic H3Rs of cholinergic projections in the dorsal hippocampus, are responsible for modulating contextual fear memory. Therefore, precise modulation of H3R in a cell-type- and subcellular-location-specific manner should be explored for pathological fear memory.

Abstract: Summary
Recent evidence supporting that adipose tissue (AT)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry an important part of the AT secretome led us to characterize the EV-adipokine profile. In addition to evidencing a high AT-derived EV secretion ability that is further increased by obesity, we identify enrichment of oligomeric forms of adiponectin in small EVs (sEVs). This adipokine is mainly distributed at the EV external surface as a result of nonspecific adsorption of soluble adiponectin. EVs also constitute stable conveyors of adiponectin in the blood circulation. Adiponectin-enriched sEVs display in vitro insulin-sensitizing effects by binding to regular adiponectin receptors. Adoptive transfer of adiponectin-enriched sEVs in high-fat-diet-fed mice prevents animals from gaining weight and ameliorated insulin resistance and tissue inflammation, with major effects observed in the AT and liver. Our results therefore provide information regarding adiponectin-related metabolic responses by highlighting EVs as delivery platforms of metabolically active forms of adiponectin molecules.

Abstract: Summary
Interleukin (IL)-6 is abundantly expressed in the tumor microenvironment and is associated with poor patient outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that the deletion of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in T cells potentiates anti-tumor immune responses by conferring the anti-tumorigenic function of IL-6 in mouse and human models. In Socs3-deficient CD8+ T cells, IL-6 upregulates the expression of type I interferon (IFN)-regulated genes and enhances the anti-tumor effector function of T cells, while also modifying mitochondrial fitness to increase mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and to promote metabolic glycolysis in the energy state. Furthermore, Socs3 deficiency reduces regulatory T cells and increases T helper 1 (Th1) cells. SOCS3 knockdown in human chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells exhibits a strong anti-tumor response in humanized mice. Thus, genetic disruption of SOCS3 offers an avenue to improve the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) remain major global healthcare challenges, and developing therapeutics necessitates using nonhuman primate models. Here, we present a transcriptomic and proteomic atlas of all the major organs of cynomolgus monkeys with spontaneous obesity or T2D in comparison to healthy controls. Molecular changes occur predominantly in the adipose tissues of individuals with obesity, while extensive expression perturbations among T2D individuals are observed in many tissues such as the liver and kidney. Immune-response-related pathways are upregulated in obesity and T2D, whereas metabolism and mitochondrial pathways are downregulated. Moreover, we highlight some potential therapeutic targets, including SLC2A1 and PCSK1 in obesity as well as SLC30A8 and SLC2A2 in T2D. Our study provides a resource for exploring the complex molecular mechanism of obesity and T2D and developing therapies for these diseases, with limitations including lack of hypothalamus, isolated islets of Langerhans, longitudinal data, and body fat percentage.

Abstract: Summary
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet current trials on therapeutic angiogenesis remain suboptimal. Type 2 immunity is critical for post-ischemic regeneration, but its regulatory role in revascularization is poorly characterized. Here, we show that type 2 cytokines, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13), are the key mediators in post-ischemic angiogenesis. IL-4/IL-13-deficient mice exhibit impaired reperfusion and muscle repair in an experimental model of PAD. We find that deletion of IL-4Rα in the endothelial compartment, rather than the myeloid compartment, leads to remarkable impairment in revascularization. Mechanistically, IL-4/IL-13 promote endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation via IL-4Rα/STAT6 signaling. Furthermore, attenuated IL-4/IL-13 expression is associated with the angiogenesis deficit in the setting of diabetic PAD, while IL-4/IL-13 treatment rescues this defective regeneration. Our findings reveal the therapeutic potential of type 2 cytokines in treating patients with muscle ischemia.

Abstract: The incidence of thyroid cancer is escalating globally, particularly among women. Studies have demonstrated the abnormal activation of Ankyrin Repeat Domain 22 (ANKRD22) in various cancers, but it remains uncertain whether it is also highly expressed in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Our objective was to evaluate the role of ANKRD22 in PTC. The expression of ANKRD22 varies among tissues, as validated by the Cancer Genome Atlas, and further predicted using the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource. Predicted results were examined via polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Subsequently, the expression of ANKRD22 in cells was suppressed by RNA interference, and changes in cell progression were examined in conjunction with the cell counting kit-8 assay, transwell assay, and colony formation assay. Finally, the effects of ANKRD22 knockdown on the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were investigated through western blotting. An in vivo mice model was established to validate the effect of ANKRD22. This study discovered that ANKRD22 was highly expressed in PTC, which was validated by polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Knockdown of ANKRD22, significantly reduced thecell viability, colony formation capability, and cell invasion and migration abilities. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of ANKRD22 impaired both tumor Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition and the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study revealed that the knockdown of ANKRD22 inhibits the growth and migration of papillary thyroid cell carcinoma by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Abstract: Summary
mRNA in eukaryotic cells is packaged into highly compacted ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm for translation. mRNP packaging and export require the evolutionarily conserved transcription-export (TREX) complex. TREX facilitates loading of various RNA-binding proteins on mRNA through the action of its DDX39B subunit. SARNP (Tho1 [transcriptional defect of Hpr1 by overexpression 1] in yeast) is shown to interact with DDX39B and affect mRNA export. The molecular mechanism of how SARNP recognizes DDX39B and functions in mRNP assembly is unclear. Here, we determine the crystal structure of a Tho1/DDX39B/RNA complex, revealing a multivalent interaction mediated by tandem DDX39B interacting motifs in SARNP/Tho1. The high-order complex of SARNP and DDX39B is evolutionarily conserved, and human SARNP can engage with five DDX39B molecules. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from SARNP knockdown cells shows the most affected RNAs in export are GC rich. Our work suggests the role of the high-order SARNP/DDX39B/RNA complex in mRNP assembly and export.

Abstract: Summary
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a crucial role in metastasis, which is the leading cause of death in breast cancer patients. Here, we show that Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (CdGAP) promotes tumor formation and metastasis to lungs in the HER2-positive (HER2+) murine breast cancer model. CdGAP facilitates intravasation, extravasation, and growth at metastatic sites. CdGAP depletion in HER2+ murine primary tumors mediates crosstalk with a Dlc1-RhoA pathway and is associated with a transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-induced EMT transcriptional signature. CdGAP is positively regulated by TGF-β signaling during EMT and interacts with the adaptor talin to modulate focal adhesion dynamics and integrin activation. Moreover, HER2+ breast cancer patients with high CdGAP mRNA expression combined with a high TGF-β-EMT signature are more likely to present lymph node invasion. Our results suggest CdGAP as a candidate therapeutic target for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer by inhibiting TGF-β and integrin/talin signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
The mammalian respiratory chain complexes I, III2, and IV (CI, CIII2, and CIV) are critical for cellular bioenergetics and form a stable assembly, the respirasome (CI-CIII2-CIV), that is biochemically and structurally well documented. The role of the respirasome in bioenergetics and the regulation of metabolism is subject to intense debate and is difficult to study because the individual respiratory chain complexes coexist together with high levels of respirasomes. To critically investigate the in vivo role of the respirasome, we generated homozygous knockin mice that have normal levels of respiratory chain complexes but profoundly decreased levels of respirasomes. Surprisingly, the mutant mice are healthy, with preserved respiratory chain capacity and normal exercise performance. Our findings show that high levels of respirasomes are dispensable for maintaining bioenergetics and physiology in mice but raise questions about their alternate functions, such as those relating to the regulation of protein stability and prevention of age-associated protein aggregation.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have accelerated functional interpretation of disease-associated variants discovered from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However, identification of trait-relevant cell populations is often impeded by inherent technical noise and high sparsity in scRNA-seq data. Here, we developed scPagwas, a computational approach that uncovers trait-relevant cellular context by integrating pathway activation transformation of scRNA-seq data and GWAS summary statistics. scPagwas effectively prioritizes trait-relevant genes, which facilitates identification of trait-relevant cell types/populations with high accuracy in extensive simulated and real datasets. Cellular-level association results identified a novel subpopulation of naive CD8+ T cells related to COVID-19 severity and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell and microglia subsets with critical pathways by which genetic variants influence Alzheimer’s disease. Overall, our approach provides new insights for the discovery of trait-relevant cell types and improves the mechanistic understanding of disease variants from a pathway perspective.

Abstract: Summary
Immune-suppressive effects of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are well characterized during anti-tumor immunity. The complex mechanisms promoting MDSC development and their regulatory effects during autoimmune diseases are less understood. We demonstrate that the endogenous alarmin S100A8/A9 reprograms myeloid cells to a T cell suppressing phenotype during autoimmune arthritis. Treatment of myeloid precursors with S100-alarmins during differentiation induces MDSCs in a Toll-like receptor 4-dependent manner. Consequently, knockout of S100A8/A9 aggravates disease activity in collagen-induced arthritis due to a deficit of MDSCs in local lymph nodes, which could be corrected by adoptive transfer of S100-induced MDSCs. Blockade of MDSC function in vivo aggravates disease severity in arthritis. Therapeutic application of S100A8 induces MDSCs in vivo and suppresses the inflammatory phenotype of S100A9ko mice. Accordingly, the interplay of T cell-mediated autoimmunity with a defective innate immune regulation is crucial for autoimmune arthritis, which should be considered for future innovative therapeutic options.

Abstract: Summary
Tooth enamel secreted by ameloblasts (AMs) is the hardest material in the human body, acting as a shield to protect the teeth. However, the enamel is gradually damaged or partially lost in over 90% of adults and cannot be regenerated due to a lack of ameloblasts in erupted teeth. Here, we use single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing (sci-RNA-seq) to establish a spatiotemporal single-cell census for the developing human tooth and identify regulatory mechanisms controlling the differentiation process of human ameloblasts. We identify key signaling pathways involved between the support cells and ameloblasts during fetal development and recapitulate those findings in human ameloblast in vitro differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We furthermore develop a disease model of amelogenesis imperfecta in a three-dimensional (3D) organoid system and show AM maturation to mineralized structure in vivo. These studies pave the way for future regenerative dentistry.

Abstract: Summary
As cerebellar granule cells (GCs) coordinate the formation of regular cerebellar networks during postnatal development, molecules in GCs are expected to be involved. Here, we test the effects of the knockdown (KD) of multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains protein 11 (MEGF11), which is a homolog of proteins mediating astrocytic phagocytosis but is substantially increased at the later developmental stages of GCs on cerebellar development. MEGF11-KD in GCs of developing mice results in abnormal cerebellar structures, including extensively ectopic Purkinje cell (PC) somas, and in impaired motor functions. MEGF11-KD also causes abnormally asynchronous synaptic release from GC axons, parallel fibers, before the appearance of abnormal cerebellar structures. Interestingly, blockade of this abnormal synaptic release restores most of the cerebellar structures. Thus, apart from phagocytic functions of its related homologs in astrocytes, MEGF11 in GCs promotes proper PC development and cerebellar network formation by regulating immature synaptic transmission.

Abstract: Summary
Histone H2B monoubiquitylation plays essential roles in chromatin-based transcriptional processes. A RING-type E3 ligase (yeast Bre1 or human RNF20/RNF40) and an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (yeast Rad6 or human hRAD6A), together, precisely deposit ubiquitin on H2B K123 in yeast or K120 in humans. Here, we developed a chemical trapping strategy and successfully captured the transient structures of Bre1- or RNF20/RNF40-mediated ubiquitin transfer from Rad6 or hRAD6A to nucleosomal H2B. Our structures show that Bre1 and RNF40 directly bind nucleosomal DNA, exhibiting a conserved E3/E2/nucleosome interaction pattern from yeast to humans for H2B monoubiquitylation. We also find an uncanonical non-hydrophobic contact in the Bre1 RING-Rad6 interface, which positions Rad6 directly above the target H2B lysine residue. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the site-specific monoubiquitylation of H2B, reveals a critical role of nucleosomal DNA in mediating E3 ligase recognition, and provides a framework for understanding the cancer-driving mutations of RNF20/RNF40.

Abstract: A fructose-enriched diet is thought to contribute to hepatic injury in developing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the cellular mechanism of fructose-induced hepatic damage remains poorly understood. This study aimed to determine whether fructose induces cell death in primary hepatocytes, and if so, to establish the underlying cellular mechanisms. Our results revealed that treatment with high fructose concentrations for 48 h induced mitochondria-mediated apoptotic death in mouse primary hepatocytes (MPHs). Endoplasmic reticulum stress responses were involved in fructose-induced death as the levels of phosho-eIF2α, phospho-C-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) increased, and a chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) prevented cell death. The impaired oxidation metabolism of fatty acids was also possibly involved in the fructose-induced toxicity as treatment with an AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activator and a PPAR-α agonist significantly protected against fructose-induced death, while carnitine palmitoyl transferase I inhibitor exacerbated the toxicity. However, uric acid-mediated toxicity was not involved in fructose-induced death as uric acid was not toxic to MPHs, and the inhibition of xanthine oxidase (a key enzyme in uric acid synthesis) did not affect cell death. On the other hand, treatment with inhibitors of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)+-consuming enzyme CD38 or CD38 gene knockdown significantly protected against fructose-induced toxicity in MPHs, and fructose treatment increased CD38 levels. These data suggest that CD38 upregulation plays a role in hepatic injury in the fructose-enriched diet-mediated NASH. Thus, CD38 inhibition may be a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent fructose-enriched diet-mediated NASH.

Abstract: Summary
The zebrafish is amenable to a variety of genetic approaches. However, lack of conditional deletion alleles limits stage- or cell-specific gene knockout. Here, we applied an existing protocol to establish a floxed allele for gata2a but failed to do so due to off-target integration and incomplete knockin. To address these problems, we applied simultaneous co-targeting with Cas12a to insert loxP sites in cis, together with transgenic counterscreening and comprehensive molecular analysis, to identify off-target insertions and confirm targeted knockins. We subsequently used our approach to establish endogenously floxed alleles of foxc1a, rasa1a, and ruvbl1, each in a single generation. We demonstrate the utility of these alleles by verifying Cre-dependent deletion, which yielded expected phenotypes in each case. Finally, we used the floxed gata2a allele to demonstrate an endothelial autonomous requirement in lymphatic valve development. Together, our results provide a framework for routine generation and application of endogenously floxed alleles in zebrafish.

Abstract: Summary
The dual-specificity kinase DYRK3 controls the formation and dissolution of multiple biomolecular condensates, regulating processes including stress recovery and mitotic progression. Here, we report that DYRK3 functionally interacts with proteins associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites (ERESs) and that inhibition of DYRK3 perturbs the organization of the ERES-Golgi interface and secretory trafficking. DYRK3-mediated regulation of ERES depends on the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the peripheral membrane protein SEC16A, which co-phase separates with ERES components to form liquid-like condensates on the surface of the ER. By modulating the liquid-like properties of ERES, we show that their physical state is essential for functional cargo trafficking through the early secretory pathway. Our findings support a mechanism whereby phosphorylation by DYRK3 and its reversal by serine-threonine phosphatases regulate the material properties of ERES to create a favorable physicochemical environment for directional membrane traffic in eukaryotic cells.

Abstract: Summary
SORL1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through genetic studies. To interrogate the roles of SORL1 in human brain cells, SORL1-null induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were differentiated to neuron, astrocyte, microglial, and endothelial cell fates. Loss of SORL1 leads to alterations in both overlapping and distinct pathways across cell types, with the greatest effects in neurons and astrocytes. SORL1 loss induces a neuron-specific reduction in apolipoprotein E (APOE) and clusterin (CLU) and altered lipid profiles. Analyses of iPSCs derived from a large cohort reveal a neuron-specific association between SORL1, APOE, and CLU levels, a finding validated in postmortem brain. Enhancement of retromer-mediated trafficking rescues tau phenotypes observed in SORL1-null neurons but does not rescue APOE levels. Pathway analyses implicate transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/SMAD signaling in SORL1 function, and modulating SMAD signaling in neurons alters APOE RNA levels in a SORL1-dependent manner. Taken together, these data provide a mechanistic link between strong genetic risk factors for AD.

Abstract: Summary
One of the key points of machine learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is the accurate learning of the fitness landscape, a conceptual mapping from sequence variants to the desired function. Here, we describe a multi-protein training scheme that leverages the existing deep mutational scanning data from diverse proteins to aid in understanding the fitness landscape of a new protein. Proof-of-concept trials are designed to validate this training scheme in three aspects: random and positional extrapolation for single-variant effects, zero-shot fitness predictions for new proteins, and extrapolation for higher-order variant effects from single-variant effects. Moreover, our study identified previously overlooked strong baselines, and their unexpectedly good performance brings our attention to the pitfalls of MLDE. Overall, these results may improve our understanding of the association between different protein fitness profiles and shed light on developing better machine learning-assisted approaches to the directed evolution of proteins. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
In response to adverse environmental conditions, embryonic development may reversibly cease, a process termed diapause. Recent reports connect this phenomenon with the non-genetic responses of tumors to chemotherapy, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Here, we establish a multifarious role for SMC4 in the switching of colorectal cancer cells to a diapause-like state. SMC4 attenuation promotes the expression of three investment phase glycolysis enzymes increasing lactate production while also suppressing PGAM1. Resultant high lactate levels increase ABC transporter expression via histone lactylation, rendering tumor cells insensitive to chemotherapy. SMC4 acts as co-activator of PGAM1 transcription, and the coordinate loss of SMC4 and PGAM1 affects F-actin assembly, inducing cytokinesis failure and polyploidy, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. These insights into the mechanisms underlying non-genetic chemotherapy resistance may have significant implications for the field, advancing our understanding of aerobic glycolysis functions in tumor and potentially informing future therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Detection of somatic mutations in single cells has been severely hampered by technical limitations of whole-genome amplification. Novel technologies including primary template-directed amplification (PTA) significantly improved the accuracy of single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) but still generate hundreds of artifacts per amplification reaction. We developed a comprehensive bioinformatic workflow, called the PTA Analysis Toolbox (PTATO), to accurately detect single base substitutions, insertions-deletions (indels), and structural variants in PTA-based WGS data. PTATO includes a machine learning approach and filtering based on recurrence to distinguish PTA artifacts from true mutations with high sensitivity (up to 90%), outperforming existing bioinformatic approaches. Using PTATO, we demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cells of patients with Fanconi anemia, which cannot be analyzed using regular WGS, have normal somatic single base substitution burdens but increased numbers of deletions. Our results show that PTATO enables studying somatic mutagenesis in the genomes of single cells with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy.

Abstract: Sphingomyelinase (SMase) catalyzes ceramide production from sphingomyelin. Ceramides are critical in cellular responses such as apoptosis. They enhance mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) through self-assembly in the mitochondrial outer membrane to form channels that release cytochrome c from intermembrane space (IMS) into the cytosol, triggering caspase-9 activation. However, the SMase involved in MOMP is yet to be identified. Here, we identified a mitochondrial Mg2+-independent SMase (mt-iSMase) from rat brain, which was purified 6,130-fold using a Percoll gradient, pulled down with biotinylated sphingomyelin, and subjected to Mono Q anion exchange. A single peak of mt-iSMase activity was eluted at a molecular mass of approximately 65 kDa using Superose 6 gel filtration. The purified enzyme showed optimal activity at pH of 6.5 and was inhibited by dithiothreitol and Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ ions. It was also inhibited by GW4869, which is a non-competitive inhibitor of Mg2+-dependent neutral SMase 2 (encoded by SMPD3), that protects against cytochrome c release-mediated cell death. Subfractionation experiments showed that mt-iSMase localizes in the IMS of the mitochondria, implying that mt-iSMase may play a critical role in generating ceramides for MOMP, cytochrome c release, and apoptosis. These data suggest that the purified enzyme in this study is a novel SMase.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor relapse is linked to rapid chemoresistance and represents a bottleneck for cancer therapy success. Engagement of a reduced proliferation state is a non-mutational mechanism exploited by cancer cells to bypass therapy-induced cell death. Through combining functional pulse-chase experiments in engineered cells and transcriptomic analyses, we identify DPPA3 as a master regulator of slow-cycling and chemoresistant phenotype in colorectal cancer (CRC). We find a vicious DPPA3-HIF1α feedback loop that downregulates FOXM1 expression via DNA methylation, thereby delaying cell-cycle progression. Moreover, downregulation of HIF1α partially restores a chemosensitive proliferative phenotype in DPPA3-overexpressing cancer cells. In cohorts of CRC patient samples, DPPA3 overexpression acts as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapeutic resistance that subsequently requires reduction in its expression to allow metastatic outgrowth. Our work demonstrates that slow-cycling cancer cells exploit a DPPA3/HIF1α axis to support tumor persistence under therapeutic stress and provides insights on the molecular regulation of disease progression.

Abstract: Summary
Post-developmental organ resizing improves organismal fitness under constantly changing nutrient environments. Although stem cell abundance is a fundamental determinant of adaptive resizing, our understanding of its underlying mechanisms remains primarily limited to the regulation of stem cell division. Here, we demonstrate that nutrient fluctuation induces dedifferentiation in the Drosophila adult midgut to drive adaptive intestinal growth. From lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify a subpopulation of enteroendocrine (EE) cells that convert into functional intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in response to dietary glucose and amino acids by activating the JAK-STAT pathway. Genetic ablation of EE-derived ISCs severely impairs ISC expansion and midgut growth despite the retention of resident ISCs, and in silico modeling further indicates that EE dedifferentiation enables an efficient increase in the midgut cell number while maintaining epithelial cell composition. Our findings identify a physiologically induced dedifferentiation that ensures ISC expansion during adaptive organ growth in concert with nutrient conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Cre/loxP technology has revolutionized genetic studies and allowed for spatial and temporal control of gene expression in specific cell types. Microglial biology has particularly benefited because microglia historically have been difficult to transduce with virus or electroporation methods for gene delivery. Here, we investigate five of the most widely available microglial inducible Cre lines. We demonstrate varying degrees of recombination efficiency, cell-type specificity, and spontaneous recombination, depending on the Cre line and inter-loxP distance. We also establish best practice guidelines and protocols to measure recombination efficiency, particularly in microglia. There is increasing evidence that microglia are key regulators of neural circuits and major drivers of a broad range of neurological diseases. Reliable manipulation of their function in vivo is of utmost importance. Identifying caveats and benefits of all tools and implementing the most rigorous protocols are crucial to the growth of the field and the development of microglia-based therapeutics.

Abstract: Summary
The ability of stem cells to switch between quiescent and proliferative states is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regeneration. In Drosophila, quiescent neural stem cells (qNSCs) extend a primary protrusion, a hallmark of qNSCs. Here, we have found that qNSC protrusions can be regenerated upon injury. This regeneration process relies on the Golgi apparatus that acts as the major acentrosomal microtubule-organizing center in qNSCs. A Golgi-resident GTPase Arf1 and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sec71 promote NSC reactivation and regeneration via the regulation of microtubule growth. Arf1 physically associates with its new effector mini spindles (Msps)/XMAP215, a microtubule polymerase. Finally, Arf1 functions upstream of Msps to target the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin to NSC-neuropil contact sites during NSC reactivation. Our findings have established Drosophila qNSCs as a regeneration model and identified Arf1/Sec71-Msps pathway in the regulation of microtubule growth and NSC reactivation.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are integral to the development of complex tumor microenvironments (TMEs) and can execute disparate cellular programs in response to extracellular cues. However, upstream signaling processes underpinning this phenotypic plasticity remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that concordant AXL-STAT3 signaling in TAMs is triggered by lung cancer cells or cancer-associated fibroblasts in the cytokine milieu. This paracrine action drives TAM differentiation toward a tumor-promoting “M2-like” phenotype with upregulation of CD163 and putative mesenchymal markers, contributing to TAM heterogeneity and diverse cellular functions. One of the upregulated markers, CD44, mediated by AXL-IL-11-pSTAT3 signaling cascade, enhances macrophage ability to interact with endothelial cells and facilitate formation of primitive vascular networks. We also found that AXL-STAT3 inhibition can impede the recruitment of TAMs in a xenograft mouse model, thereby suppressing tumor growth. These findings suggest the potential application of AXL-STAT3-related markers to quantitatively assess metastatic potential and inform therapeutic strategies in lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
During hibernation, some mammals show low body temperatures (<10°C). Tissues from hibernators exhibit cold resistance even when the animal is not hibernating. Mice can also enter hypothermic fasting-induced torpor (FIT), but the cold resistance of FIT has never been related to their tissues. Here, we show that an inbred mouse STM2 exhibits lower body temperature during FIT than C57BL/6J or MYS/Mz. Thus, STM2 resists the cold more than other strains. Analysis of strain-specific mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells shows that STM2 ES cells are more cold-resistant than others and rely on the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway but respire independently of the electron transfer chain complex I in the cold. We also found that the liver of STM2 uses OXPHOS more in cold than other strains. This study demonstrates that an organismal phenotype associated with torpor can be effectively studied in an in vitro setup using mouse cells.

Abstract: Summary
African populations have been drastically underrepresented in genomics research, and failure to capture the genetic diversity across the numerous ethnolinguistic groups (ELGs) found on the continent has hindered the equity of precision medicine initiatives globally. Here, we describe the whole-genome sequencing of 449 Nigerian individuals across 47 unique self-reported ELGs. Population structure analysis reveals genetic differentiation among our ELGs, consistent with previous findings. From the 36 million SNPs and insertions or deletions (indels) discovered in our dataset, we provide a high-level catalog of both novel and medically relevant variation present across the ELGs. These results emphasize the value of this resource for genomics research, with added granularity by representing multiple ELGs from Nigeria. Our results also underscore the potential of using these cohorts with larger sample sizes to improve our understanding of human ancestry and health in Africa.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical process in renal epithelial cells upon kidney injury. While its implication in kidney disease progression is established, the mechanisms modulating it remain unclear. Here, we describe the role of Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), a protein expressed in injured tubular cells, in mitochondrial dysfunction. We show that LCN2 expression decreases mitochondrial mass and function and induces mitochondrial fragmentation. Importantly, while LCN2 expression favors DRP1 mitochondrial recruitment, DRP1 inhibition antagonizes LCN2’s effect on mitochondrial shape. Remarkably, LCN2 promotes mitochondrial fragmentation independently of its secretion or transport iron activity. Mechanistically, intracellular LCN2 expression increases mTOR activity, and rapamycin inhibits LCN2’s effect on mitochondrial shape. In vivo, Lcn2 gene inactivation prevents mTOR activation and mitochondrial length decrease observed upon ischemia-reperfusion-induced kidney injury (IRI) in Lcn2+/+ mice. Our data identify LCN2 as a key regulator of mitochondrial dynamics and further elucidate the mechanisms leading to mitochondrial dysfunction.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) rapidly resist cytotoxic chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments. New, non-cross-resistant therapies are thus needed. SCLC cells are committed into neuroendocrine lineage then maturation arrested. Implicating DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the maturation arrests, we find (1) the repression mark methylated CpG, written by DNMT1, is retained at suppressed neuroendocrine-lineage genes, even as other repression marks are erased; (2) DNMT1 is recurrently amplified, whereas Ten-Eleven-Translocation 2 (TET2), which functionally opposes DNMT1, is deleted; (3) DNMT1 is recruited into neuroendocrine-lineage master transcription factor (ASCL1, NEUROD1) hubs in SCLC cells; and (4) DNMT1 knockdown activated ASCL1-target genes and released SCLC cell-cycling exits by terminal lineage maturation, which are cycling exits that do not require the p53/apoptosis pathway used by cytotoxic chemotherapy. Inhibiting DNMT1/corepressors with clinical compounds accordingly extended survival of mice with chemorefractory and ICI-refractory, p53-null, disseminated SCLC. Lineage commitment of SCLC cells can hence be leveraged into non-cytotoxic therapy able to treat chemo/ICI-refractory SCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Mechanosensory neurons innervating the skin underlie our sense of touch. Fast-conducting, rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors innervating glabrous (non-hairy) skin form Meissner corpuscles, while in hairy skin, they associate with hair follicles, forming longitudinal lanceolate endings. How mechanoreceptors develop axonal endings appropriate for their skin targets is unknown. We report that mechanoreceptor morphologies across different skin regions are indistinguishable during early development but diverge post-natally, in parallel with skin maturation. Neurons terminating along the glabrous and hairy skin border exhibit hybrid morphologies, forming both Meissner corpuscles and lanceolate endings. Additionally, molecular profiles of neonatal glabrous and hairy skin-innervating neurons largely overlap. In mouse mutants with ectopic glabrous skin, mechanosensory neurons form end-organs appropriate for the altered skin type. Finally, BMP5 and BMP7 are enriched in glabrous skin, and signaling through type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors in neurons is critical for Meissner corpuscle morphology. Thus, mechanoreceptor morphogenesis is flexibly instructed by target tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroblastoma is a pediatric solid tumor characterized by strong clinical heterogeneity. Although clinical risk-defining genomic alterations exist in neuroblastomas, the mutational processes involved in their generation remain largely unclear. By examining the topography and mutational signatures derived from all variant classes, we identified co-occurring mutational footprints, which we termed mutational scenarios. We demonstrate that clinical neuroblastoma heterogeneity is associated with differences in the mutational processes driving these scenarios, linking risk-defining pathognomonic variants to distinct molecular processes. Whereas high-risk MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas were characterized by signs of replication slippage and stress, homologous recombination-associated signatures defined high-risk non-MYCN-amplified patients. Non-high-risk neuroblastomas were marked by footprints of chromosome mis-segregation and TOP1 mutational activity. Furthermore, analysis of subclonal mutations uncovered differential activity of these processes through neuroblastoma evolution. Thus, clinical heterogeneity of neuroblastoma patients can be linked to differences in the mutational processes that are active in their tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Determining which features of the neural code drive behavior requires the ability to simultaneously read out and write in neural activity patterns with high precision across many neurons. All-optical systems that combine two-photon calcium imaging and targeted photostimulation enable the activation of specific, functionally defined groups of neurons. However, these techniques are unable to test how patterns of activity across a population contribute to computation because of an inability to both read and write cell-specific firing rates. To overcome this challenge, we make two advances: first, we introduce a genetic line of mice for Cre-dependent co-expression of a calcium indicator and a potent soma-targeted microbial opsin. Second, using this line, we develop a method for read-out and write-in of precise population vectors of neural activity by calibrating the photostimulation to each cell. These advances offer a powerful and convenient platform for investigating the neural codes of computation and behavior.

Abstract: Summary
How the opportunistic Gram-negative pathogens of the genus Achromobacter interact with the innate immune system is poorly understood. Using three Achromobacter clinical isolates from two species, we show that the type 3 secretion system (T3SS) is required to induce cell death in human macrophages by inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis. Macrophages deficient in the inflammasome sensors NLRC4 or NLRP3 undergo pyroptosis upon bacterial internalization, but those deficient in both NLRC4 and NLRP3 do not, suggesting either sensor mediates pyroptosis in a T3SS-dependent manner. Detailed analysis of the intracellular trafficking of one isolate indicates that the intracellular bacteria reside in a late phagolysosome. Using an intranasal mouse infection model, we observe that Achromobacter damages lung structure and causes severe illness, contingent on a functional T3SS. Together, we demonstrate that Achromobacter species can survive phagocytosis by promoting macrophage cell death and inflammation by redundant mechanisms of pyroptosis induction in a T3SS-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
The balance of contralateral and ipsilateral retinogeniculate projections is critical for binocular vision, but the transcriptional programs regulating this process remain ill defined. Here we show that the Pou class homeobox protein POU3F1 is expressed in nascent mouse contralateral retinal ganglion cells (cRGCs) but not ipsilateral RGCs (iRGCs). Upon Pou3f1 inactivation, the proportion of cRGCs is reduced in favor of iRGCs, leading to abnormal projection ratios at the optic chiasm. Conversely, misexpression of Pou3f1 in progenitors increases the production of cRGCs. Using CUT&RUN and RNA sequencing in gain- and loss-of-function assays, we demonstrate that POU3F1 regulates expression of several key members of the cRGC gene regulatory network. Finally, we report that POU3F1 is sufficient to induce RGC-like cell production, even in late-stage retinal progenitors of Atoh7 knockout mice. This work uncovers POU3F1 as a regulator of the cRGC transcriptional program, opening possibilities for optic nerve regenerative therapies.

HIF-1α drives resistance to ferroptosis in solid tumors by promoting lactate production and activating SLC1A1,

Abstract: Summary
Solid tumors have developed robust ferroptosis resistance. The mechanism underlying ferroptosis resistance regulation in solid tumors, however, remains elusive. Here, we report that the hypoxic tumor microenvironment potently promotes ferroptosis resistance in solid tumors in a hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)-dependent manner. In combination with HIF-2α, which promotes tumor ferroptosis under hypoxia, HIF-1α is the main driver of hypoxia-induced ferroptosis resistance. Mechanistically, HIF-1α-induced lactate contributes to ferroptosis resistance in a pH-dependent manner that is parallel to the classical SLC7A11 and FSP1 systems. In addition, HIF-1α also enhances transcription of SLC1A1, an important glutamate transporter, and promotes cystine uptake to promote ferroptosis resistance. In support of the role of hypoxia in ferroptosis resistance, silencing HIF-1α sensitizes mouse solid tumors to ferroptosis inducers. In conclusion, our results reveal a mechanism by which hypoxia drives ferroptosis resistance and identify the combination of hypoxia alleviation and ferroptosis induction as a promising therapeutic strategy for solid tumors.

Abstract: Summary
2-Hydroxyglutarate (2HG) is a byproduct of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and is readily detected in the tissues of healthy individuals. 2HG is found in two enantiomeric forms: S-2HG and R-2HG. Here, we investigate the differential roles of these two enantiomers in cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T cell biology, where we find they have highly divergent effects on proliferation, differentiation, and T cell function. We show here an analysis of structural determinants that likely underlie these differential effects on specific α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent enzymes. Treatment of CD8+ T cells with exogenous S-2HG, but not R-2HG, increased CD8+ T cell fitness in vivo and enhanced anti-tumor activity. These data show that S-2HG and R-2HG should be considered as two distinct and important actors in the regulation of T cell function.

Abstract: Summary
Jawless vertebrates possess an alternative adaptive immune system in which antigens are recognized by variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) generated by combinatorial assembly of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) cassettes. Three types of receptors, VLRA, VLRB, and VLRC, have been previously identified. VLRA- and VLRC-expressing cells are T cell-like, whereas VLRB-expressing cells are B cell-like. Here, we report two types of VLRs in lampreys, VLRD and VLRE, phylogenetically related to VLRA and VLRC. The germline VLRD and VLRE genes are flanked by 39 LRR cassettes used in the assembly of mature VLRD and VLRE, with cassettes from chromosomes containing the VLRA and VLRC genes also contributing to VLRD and VLRE assemblies. VLRD and VLRE transcription is highest in the triple-negative (VLRA−/VLRB−/VLRC−) population of lymphocytes, albeit also detectable in VLRA+ and VLRC+ populations. Tissue distribution studies suggest that lamprey VLRD+ and VLRE+ lymphocytes comprise T-like sublineages of cells.

Abstract: Summary
Selectively ablating damaged cells is an evolving therapeutic approach for age-related disease. Current methods for genome-wide screens to identify genes whose deletion might promote the death of damaged or senescent cells are generally underpowered because of the short timescales of cell death as well as the difficulty of scaling non-dividing cells. Here, we establish “Death-seq,” a positive-selection CRISPR screen optimized to identify enhancers and mechanisms of cell death. Our screens identified synergistic enhancers of cell death induced by the known senolytic ABT-263. The screen also identified inducers of cell death and senescent cell clearance in models of age-related diseases by a related compound, ABT-199, which alone is not senolytic but exhibits less toxicity than ABT-263. Death-seq enables the systematic screening of cell death pathways to uncover molecular mechanisms of regulated cell death subroutines and identifies drug targets for the treatment of diverse pathological states such as senescence, cancer, and fibrosis.

Abstract: Summary
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is driven by genomic alterations in concert with dietary influences, with the gut microbiome implicated as an effector in disease development and progression. While meta-analyses have provided mechanistic insight into patients with CRC, study heterogeneity has limited causal associations. Using multi-omics studies on genetically controlled cohorts of mice, we identify diet as the major driver of microbial and metabolomic differences, with reductions in α diversity and widespread changes in cecal metabolites seen in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In addition, non-classic amino acid conjugation of the bile acid cholic acid (AA-CA) increased with HFD. We show that AA-CAs impact intestinal stem cell growth and demonstrate that Ileibacterium valens and Ruminococcus gnavus are able to synthesize these AA-CAs. This multi-omics dataset implicates diet-induced shifts in the microbiome and the metabolome in disease progression and has potential utility in future diagnostic and therapeutic developments.

Abstract: Summary
We report a personalized tumor-informed technology, Patient-specific pROgnostic and Potential tHErapeutic marker Tracking (PROPHET) using deep sequencing of 50 patient-specific variants to detect molecular residual disease (MRD) with a limit of detection of 0.004%. PROPHET and state-of-the-art fixed-panel assays were applied to 760 plasma samples from 181 prospectively enrolled early stage non-small cell lung cancer patients. PROPHET shows higher sensitivity of 45% at baseline with circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). It outperforms fixed-panel assays in prognostic analysis and demonstrates a median lead-time of 299 days to radiologically confirmed recurrence. Personalized non-canonical variants account for 98.2% with prognostic effects similar to canonical variants. The proposed tumor-node-metastasis-blood (TNMB) classification surpasses TNM staging for prognostic prediction at the decision point of adjuvant treatment. PROPHET shows potential to evaluate the effect of adjuvant therapy and serve as an arbiter of the equivocal radiological diagnosis. These findings highlight the potential advantages of personalized cancer techniques in MRD detection.

Abstract: Summary
Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2), modulated by endogenous ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate and exogenous niacin, is a promising therapeutic target for inflammation-related diseases. HCAR2 mediates distinct pathophysiological events by activating Gi/o protein or β-arrestin effectors. Here, we characterize compound 9n as a Gi-biased allosteric modulator (BAM) of HCAR2 and exhibit anti-inflammatory efficacy in RAW264.7 macrophages via a specific HCAR2-Gi pathway. Furthermore, four structures of HCAR2-Gi complex bound to orthosteric agonists (niacin or monomethyl fumarate), compound 9n, and niacin together with compound 9n simultaneously reveal a common orthosteric site and a unique allosteric site. Combined with functional studies, we decipher the action framework of biased allosteric modulation of compound 9n on the orthosteric site. Moreover, co-administration of compound 9n with orthosteric agonists could enhance anti-inflammatory effects in the mouse model of colitis. Together, our study provides insight to understand the molecular pharmacology of the BAM and facilitates exploring the therapeutic potential of the BAM with orthosteric drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Despite growing knowledge of the functions of individual human transcriptional effector domains, much less is understood about how multiple effector domains within the same protein combine to regulate gene expression. Here, we measure transcriptional activity for 8,400 effector domain combinations by recruiting them to reporter genes in human cells. In our assay, weak and moderate activation domains synergize to drive strong gene expression, whereas combining strong activators often results in weaker activation. In contrast, repressors combine linearly and produce full gene silencing, and repressor domains often overpower activation domains. We use this information to build a synthetic transcription factor whose function can be tuned between repression and activation independent of recruitment to target genes by using a small-molecule drug. Altogether, we outline the basic principles of how effector domains combine to regulate gene expression and demonstrate their value in building precise and flexible synthetic biology tools. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Basic helix-loop-helix genes, particularly proneural genes, are well-described triggers of cell differentiation, yet information on their dynamics is limited, notably in human development. Here, we focus on Neurogenin 3 (NEUROG3), which is crucial for pancreatic endocrine lineage initiation. By monitoring both NEUROG3 gene expression and protein in single cells using a knockin dual reporter in 2D and 3D models of human pancreas development, we show an approximately 2-fold slower expression of human NEUROG3 than that of the mouse. We observe heterogeneous peak levels of NEUROG3 expression and reveal through long-term live imaging that both low and high NEUROG3 peak levels can trigger differentiation into hormone-expressing cells. Based on fluorescence intensity, we statistically integrate single-cell transcriptome with dynamic behaviors of live cells and propose a data-mapping methodology applicable to other contexts. Using this methodology, we identify a role for KLK12 in motility at the onset of NEUROG3 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Temperature increases as light intensity rises, but whether light signals can be directly linked to high temperature response in plants is unclear. Here, we find that light pre-treatment enables plants to survive better under high temperature, designated as light-induced thermotolerance (LIT). With short-term light treatment, plants induce light-signaling pathway genes and heat shock genes. Blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) is required for LIT. We also find that CRY1 physically interacts with the heat shock transcription factor A1d (HsfA1d) and that HsfA1d is involved in thermotolerance under light treatment. Furthermore, CRY1 promotes HsfA1d nuclear localization through importin alpha 1 (IMPα1). Consistent with this, CRY1 shares more than half of the chromatin binding sites with HsfA1d. Mutation of CRY1 (cry1-304) diminishes a large number of HsfA1d binding sites that are shared with CRY1. We present a model where, by coupling light sensing to high-temperature stress, CRY1 confers thermotolerance in plants via HsfA1d.

Abstract: Summary
Cardiac lymphatic vessels play important roles in fluid homeostasis, inflammation, disease, and regeneration of the heart. The developing cardiac lymphatics in human fetal hearts are closely associated with coronary arteries, similar to those in zebrafish hearts. We identify a population of cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) that reside in the epicardium. Single-nuclei multiomic analysis of the human fetal heart reveals the plasticity and heterogeneity of the cardiac endothelium. Furthermore, we find that VEGFC is highly expressed in arterial endothelial cells and epicardium-derived cells, providing a molecular basis for the arterial association of cardiac lymphatic development. Using a cell-type-specific integrative analysis, we identify a population of cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells marked by the PROX1 and the lymphangiocrine RELN and enriched in binding motifs of erythroblast transformation specific (ETS) variant (ETV) transcription factors. We report the in vivo molecular characterization of human cardiac lymphatics and provide a valuable resource to understand fetal heart development.

Abstract: Summary
SUV420H1 di- and tri-methylates histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me2/H4K20me3) and plays crucial roles in DNA replication, repair, and heterochromatin formation. It is dysregulated in several cancers. Many of these processes were linked to its catalytic activity. However, deletion and inhibition of SUV420H1 have shown distinct phenotypes, suggesting that the enzyme likely has uncharacterized non-catalytic activities. Our cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), biochemical, biophysical, and cellular analyses reveal how SUV420H1 recognizes its nucleosome substrates, and how histone variant H2A.Z stimulates its catalytic activity. SUV420H1 binding to nucleosomes causes a dramatic detachment of nucleosomal DNA from the histone octamer, which is a non-catalytic activity. We hypothesize that this regulates the accessibility of large macromolecular complexes to chromatin. We show that SUV420H1 can promote chromatin condensation, another non-catalytic activity that we speculate is needed for its heterochromatin functions. Together, our studies uncover and characterize the catalytic and non-catalytic mechanisms of SUV420H1, a key histone methyltransferase that plays an essential role in genomic stability.

Abstract: Summary
The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease SENP6 disassembles SUMO chains from cellular substrate proteins. We use a proteomic method to identify putative SENP6 substrates based on increased apparent molecular weight after SENP6 depletion. Proteins of the lamin family of intermediate filaments show substantially increased SUMO modification after SENP6 depletion. This is accompanied by nuclear structural changes remarkably like those associated with laminopathies. Two SUMO attachment sites on lamin A/C are close to sites of mutations in Emery-Driefuss and limb girdle muscular dystrophy. To establish a direct link between lamin SUMOylation and the observed phenotype, we developed proximity-induced SUMO modification (PISM), which fuses a lamin A/C targeting DARPin to a SUMO E3 ligase domain. This directly targets lamin A/C for SUMO conjugation and demonstrates that enhanced lamin SUMO modification recapitulates the altered nuclear structure manifest after SENP6 depletion. This shows SENP6 activity protects the nucleus against hyperSUMOylation-induced laminopathy-like alterations.

Abstract: Summary
Cooperative DNA binding of transcription factors (TFs) integrates the cellular context to support cell specification during development. Naive mouse embryonic stem cells are derived from early development and can sustain their pluripotent identity indefinitely. Here, we ask whether TFs associated with pluripotency evolved to directly support this state or if the state emerges from their combinatorial action. NANOG and ESRRB are key pluripotency factors that co-bind DNA. We find that when both factors are expressed, ESRRB supports pluripotency. However, when NANOG is absent, ESRRB supports a bistable culture of cells with an embryo-like primitive endoderm identity ancillary to pluripotency. The stoichiometry between NANOG and ESRRB allows quantitative titration of this differentiation, and in silico modeling of bipartite ESRRB activity suggests it safeguards plasticity in differentiation. Thus, the concerted activity of cooperative TFs can transform their effect to sustain intermediate cell identities and allow ex vivo expansion of immortal stem cells. A record of this paper’s transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative splicing (AS) has been implicated in cell cycle regulation and cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The poly(U)-binding splicing factor 60 (PUF60) is essential for embryonic development and is overexpressed in multiple types of cancer. Here, we report that PUF60 promotes mitotic cell cycle and lung cancer progression by controlling AS of the cell division cycle 25C (CDC25C). Systematic analysis of splicing factors deregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) identifies that elevated copy number and expression of PUF60 correlate with poor prognosis. PUF60 depletion inhibits LUAD cell-cycle G2/M transition, cell proliferation, and tumor development. Mechanistically, PUF60 knockdown leads to exon skipping enriched in mitotic cell cycle genes, including CDC25C. Exon 3 skipping in the full-length CDC25C results in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and a decrease of CDC25C protein, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. This study establishes PUF60 as a cell cycle regulator and an oncogenic splicing factor in lung cancer.

Abstract: Summary
Neuroblastoma is a lethal childhood solid tumor of developing peripheral nerves. Two percent of children with neuroblastoma develop opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome (OMAS), a paraneoplastic disease characterized by cerebellar and brainstem-directed autoimmunity but typically with outstanding cancer-related outcomes. We compared tumor transcriptomes and tumor-infiltrating T and B cell repertoires from 38 OMAS subjects with neuroblastoma to 26 non-OMAS-associated neuroblastomas. We found greater B and T cell infiltration in OMAS-associated tumors compared to controls and showed that both were polyclonal expansions. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were enriched in OMAS-associated tumors. We identified significant enrichment of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II allele HLA-DOB∗01:01 in OMAS patients. OMAS severity scores were associated with the expression of several candidate autoimmune genes. We propose a model in which polyclonal auto-reactive B lymphocytes act as antigen-presenting cells and drive TLS formation, thereby supporting both sustained polyclonal T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity and paraneoplastic OMAS neuropathology.

Abstract: Summary
Hsp104 is an AAA+ protein disaggregase that solubilizes and reactivates proteins trapped in aggregated states. We have engineered potentiated Hsp104 variants to mitigate toxic misfolding of α-synuclein, TDP-43, and FUS implicated in fatal neurodegenerative disorders. Though potent disaggregases, these enhanced Hsp104 variants lack substrate specificity and can have unfavorable off-target effects. Here, to lessen off-target effects, we engineer substrate-specific Hsp104 variants. By altering Hsp104 pore loops that engage substrate, we disambiguate Hsp104 variants that selectively suppress α-synuclein toxicity but not TDP-43 or FUS toxicity. Remarkably, α-synuclein-specific Hsp104 variants emerge that mitigate α-synuclein toxicity via distinct ATPase-dependent mechanisms involving α-synuclein disaggregation or detoxification of soluble α-synuclein conformers. Importantly, both types of α-synuclein-specific Hsp104 variant reduce dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a C. elegans model of Parkinson’s disease more effectively than non-specific variants. We suggest that increasing the substrate specificity of enhanced disaggregases could be applied broadly to tailor therapeutics for neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Summary
The miR-17∼92 family microRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in germinal center (GC) reaction through promoting T follicular helper (TFH) cell differentiation. It remains unclear whether they also have intrinsic functions in B cell differentiation and function. Here we show that mice with B cell-specific deletion of the miR-17∼92 family exhibit impaired GC reaction, plasma cell differentiation, and antibody production in response to protein antigen immunization and chronic viral infection. Employing CRISPR-mediated functional screening, we identify Socs3 as a key functional target of miR-17∼92 in regulating plasma cell differentiation. Mechanistically, SOCS3, whose expression is elevated in miR-17∼92 family-deficient B cells, interacts with NIK and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation, thereby impairing NF-κB signaling and plasma cell differentiation. This moderate increase in SOCS3 expression has little effect on IL-21-STAT3 signaling. Our study demonstrates differential sensitivity of two key signaling pathways to alterations in the protein level of an miRNA target gene.

Abstract: Summary
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies display clinical efficacy in microsatellite instable (MSI) endometrial cancer (EC) treatment, the key mechanism of which is reversing T cell exhaustion and restoration of anti-tumor immunity. Here, we demonstrate that transcription factor 19 (TCF19), one of the most significantly differentially expressed genes between MSI and microsatellite stable (MSS) patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-EC cohort, is associated with poor prognosis and immune exhaustion signature. Specifically, TCF19 is significantly elevated in MSI EC, which in turn promotes tripartite motif-containing 14 (TRIM14) transcription and correlates with hyperactive signaling of the TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-interferon β (IFN-β) pathway. The TCF19-TRIM14 axis promotes tumorigenicity under non-immunological background, and the enhanced downstream secretion of IFN-β facilitates CD8+ T cell exhaustion through cell differentiation reprogramming. Finally, using humanized models, we show that a combination of TCF19 inhibition and ICB therapy demonstrates more effective anti-tumor responses. Together, our study indicates that targeting TCF19 is a potent strategy for alleviating CD8+ T cell exhaustion and synergizing with ICB in tumor treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Stem-like CD8+ T cells are regulated by T cell factor 1 (TCF1) and are considered requisite for immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response. However, recent findings indicate that reliance on TCF1+CD8+ T cells for ICB efficacy may differ across tumor contexts. We find that TCF1 is essential for optimal priming of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and ICB response in poorly immunogenic tumors that accumulate TOX+ dysfunctional T cells, but is dispensable for T cell priming and therapy response in highly immunogenic tumors that efficiently expand transitory effectors. Importantly, improving T cell priming by vaccination or by enhancing antigen presentation on tumors rescues the defective responses of TCF1-deficient CD8+ T cells upon ICB in poorly immunogenic tumors. Our study highlights TCF1’s role during the early stages of anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses with important implications for guiding optimal therapeutic interventions in cancers with low TCF1+CD8+ T cells and low-neo-antigen expression.

Abstract: Summary
CTCF is a critical regulator of genome architecture and gene expression that binds thousands of sites on chromatin. CTCF genomic localization is controlled by the recognition of a DNA sequence motif and regulated by DNA modifications. However, CTCF does not bind to all its potential sites in all cell types, raising the question of whether the underlying chromatin structure can regulate CTCF occupancy. Here, we report that R-loops facilitate CTCF binding through the formation of associated G-quadruplex (G4) structures. R-loops and G4s co-localize with CTCF at many genomic regions in mouse embryonic stem cells and promote CTCF binding to its cognate DNA motif in vitro. R-loop attenuation reduces CTCF binding in vivo. Deletion of a specific G4-forming motif in a gene reduces CTCF binding and alters gene expression. Conversely, chemical stabilization of G4s results in CTCF gains and accompanying alterations in chromatin organization, suggesting a pivotal role for G4 structures in reinforcing long-range genome interactions through CTCF.

Abstract: Summary
Controlled release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) is crucial for gene regulation. However, studying RNA Pol II pausing is challenging, as pause-release factors are almost all essential. In this study, we identified heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in SUPT5H, which encodes SPT5, in individuals with β-thalassemia. During erythropoiesis in healthy human cells, cell cycle genes were highly paused as cells transition from progenitors to precursors. When the pathogenic mutations were recapitulated by SUPT5H editing, RNA Pol II pause release was globally disrupted, and as cells began transitioning from progenitors to precursors, differentiation was delayed, accompanied by a transient lag in erythroid-specific gene expression and cell cycle kinetics. Despite this delay, cells terminally differentiate, and cell cycle phase distributions normalize. Therefore, hindering pause release perturbs proliferation and differentiation dynamics at a key transition during erythropoiesis, identifying a role for RNA Pol II pausing in temporally coordinating the cell cycle and erythroid differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Wallerian axonal degeneration (WD) does not occur in the nematode C. elegans, in contrast to other model animals. However, WD depends on the NADase activity of SARM1, a protein that is also expressed in C. elegans (ceSARM/ceTIR-1). We hypothesized that differences in SARM between species might exist and account for the divergence in WD. We first show that expression of the human (h)SARM1, but not ceTIR-1, in C. elegans neurons is sufficient to confer axon degeneration after nerve injury. Next, we determined the cryoelectron microscopy structure of ceTIR-1 and found that, unlike hSARM1, which exists as an auto-inhibited ring octamer, ceTIR-1 forms a readily active 9-mer. Enzymatically, the NADase activity of ceTIR-1 is substantially weaker (10-fold higher Km) than that of hSARM1, and even when fully active, it falls short of consuming all cellular NAD+. Our experiments provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and evolution of SARM orthologs and WD across species.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian organs exhibit distinct physiology, disease susceptibility, and injury responses between the sexes. In the mouse kidney, sexually dimorphic gene activity maps predominantly to proximal tubule (PT) segments. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data demonstrated that sex differences were established from 4 and 8 weeks after birth under gonadal control. Hormone injection studies and genetic removal of androgen and estrogen receptors demonstrated androgen receptor (AR)-mediated regulation of gene activity in PT cells as the regulatory mechanism. Interestingly, caloric restriction feminizes the male kidney. Single-nuclear multiomic analysis identified putative cis-regulatory regions and cooperating factors mediating PT responses to AR activity in the mouse kidney. In the human kidney, a limited set of genes showed conserved sex-linked regulation, whereas analysis of the mouse liver underscored organ-specific differences in the regulation of sexually dimorphic gene expression. These findings raise interesting questions on the evolution, physiological significance, disease, and metabolic linkage of sexually dimorphic gene activity.
