Abstract: Summary
Cardiac tissue undergoes renewal with low rates. Although resident stem cell populations have been identified to support cardiomyocyte turnover, the source of the cardiac stem cells and their niche remain elusive. Using Cre/Lox-based cell lineage tracing strategies, we discovered that labeling of endothelial cells in the adult heart yields progeny that have cardiac stem cell characteristics and express Gata4 and Sca1. Endothelial-derived cardiac progenitor cells were localized in the arterial coronary walls with quiescent and proliferative cells in the media and adventitia layers, respectively. Within the myocardium, we identified labeled cardiomyocytes organized in clusters of single-cell origin. Pulse-chase experiments showed that generation of individual clusters was rapid but confined to specific regions of the heart, primarily in the right anterior and left posterior ventricular walls and the junctions between the two ventricles. Our data demonstrate that endothelial cells are an intrinsic component of the cardiac renewal process.

Abstract: Summary
Ponatinib is the only currently approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that suppresses all BCR-ABL1 single mutants in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia, including the recalcitrant BCR-ABL1T315I mutant. However, emergence of compound mutations in a BCR-ABL1 allele may confer ponatinib resistance. We found that clinically reported BCR-ABL1 compound mutants center on 12 key positions and confer varying resistance to imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, ponatinib, rebastinib, and bosutinib. T315I-inclusive compound mutants confer high-level resistance to TKIs, including ponatinib. In vitro resistance profiling was predictive of treatment outcomes in Ph+ leukemia patients. Structural explanations for compound mutation-based resistance were obtained through molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings demonstrate that BCR-ABL1 compound mutants confer different levels of TKI resistance, necessitating rational treatment selection to optimize clinical outcome.

Abstract: MscS and MscL, bacterial mechanosensitive channels, play crucial roles in the hypo-osmotic shock response. However, only MscS has homologs in eukaryotes. These homologs are called MscS-like proteins or MSL proteins. MSL proteins have changed both structurally and functionally during evolution and are now localized not only to the membrane of the chloroplast, which is thought to be a descendant of an ancient, free-living bacterium, but also the cell membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, suggesting that the role of MSL proteins has diverged. In this brief review, we mainly focus on two MSL proteins in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe that are localized in the ER membrane and protect cells from hypo-osmotic shock-induced death by regulating intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. We also discuss Arabidopsis thaliana MSL proteins and other yeast ion channels in terms of osmoregulation in eukaryotes.

Abstract: Summary
Sel1L is an essential adaptor protein for the E3 ligase Hrd1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), a universal quality-control system in the cell; but its physiological role remains unclear. Here we show that mice with adipocyte-specific Sel1L deficiency are resistant to diet-induced obesity and exhibit postprandial hypertriglyceridemia. Further analyses reveal that Sel1L is indispensable for the secretion of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), independent of its role in Hrd1-mediated ERAD and ER homeostasis. Sel1L physically interacts with and stabilizes the LPL maturation complex consisting of LPL and lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1). In the absence of Sel1L, LPL is retained in the ER and forms protein aggregates, which are degraded primarily by autophagy. The Sel1L-mediated control of LPL secretion is also seen in other LPL-expressing cell types including cardiac myocytes and macrophages. Thus, our study reports a role of Sel1L in LPL secretion and systemic lipid metabolism.

The Hippo Pathway Effector Yap Controls Patterning and Differentiation of Airway Epithelial Progenitors,

Abstract: Summary
How epithelial progenitor cells integrate local signals to balance expansion with differentiation during organogenesis is still little understood. Here, we provide evidence that the Hippo pathway effector Yap is a key regulator of this process in the developing lung. We show that when epithelial tubules are forming and branching, a nucleocytoplasmic shift in Yap localization marks the boundary between the airway and the distal lung compartments. At this transition zone, Yap specifies a transcriptional program that controls Sox2 expression and ultimately generates the airway epithelium. Without Yap, epithelial progenitors are unable to properly respond to local TGF-β-induced cues and control levels and distribution of Sox2 to form airways. Yap levels and subcellular localization also markedly influence Sox2 expression and differentiation of adult airway progenitors. Our data reveal a role for the Hippo-Yap pathway in integrating growth-factor-induced cues in the developing and adult lung potentially key for homeostasis and regeneration repair.

Abstract: Summary
The human growth hormone (hGH) minigene is frequently used in the derivation of transgenic mouse lines to enhance transgene expression. Although this minigene is present in the transgenes as a secondcistron, and thus not thought to be expressed, we found that three commonly used lines, Pdx1-CreLate, RIP-Cre, and MIP-GFP, each expressed significant amounts of hGH in pancreatic islets. Locally secreted hGH binds to prolactin receptors on β cells, activates STAT5 signaling, and induces pregnancy-like changes in gene expression, thereby augmenting pancreatic β cell mass and insulin content. In addition, islets of Pdx1-CreLate mice have lower GLUT2 expression and reduced glucose-induced insulin release and are protected against the β cell toxin streptozotocin. These findings may be important when interpreting results obtained when these and other hGH minigene-containing transgenic mice are used.

Abstract: Summary
The mechanisms that govern proteolytic maturation or complete destruction of the precursor proteins p100 and p105 are fundamental to homeostasis and activation of NF-κB; however, they remain poorly understood. Using mass-spectrometry-based quantitative analysis of noncanonical LTβR-induced signaling, we demonstrate that stimulation induces simultaneous processing of both p100 and p105. The precursors not only form hetero-oligomers but also interact with the ATPase VCP/p97, and their induced proteolysis strictly depends on the signal response domain (SRD) of p100, suggesting that the SRD-targeting proteolytic machinery acts in cis and in trans. Separation of cellular pools by isotope labeling revealed synchronous dynamics of p105 and p100 proteolysis. The generation of p50 and p52 from their precursors depends on functional VCP/p97. We have developed quantitative mathematical models that describe the dynamics of the system and predict that p100-p105 complexes are signal responsive.

Abstract: Summary
The casein kinase 1 (CK1) family participates in various cellular processes in eukaryotes, but CK1 function in higher plants remains largely unknown. Here, we characterize the function of Arabidopsis CK1 in the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. Etiolated seedlings of a CK1.8-deficient mutant, ck1.8-1, showed characteristic ethylene-specific constitutive responses due to overaccumulation of ethylene. Biochemical and physiological studies showed that CK1.8 phosphorylates ACS5, a key enzyme of ethylene biosynthesis, at threonine 463 to promote its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ethylene Overproduction 1 (ETO1). Deficiency of CK1.8 leads to the accumulation of ACS5, and transgenic plants harboring a dephosphorylation-mimic ACS5T463A showed constitutive ethylene responses, confirming the role of CK1.8 in regulating ACS5 stability by phosphorylation and demonstrating that CK1.8 is an important regulator of ethylene biosynthesis. CK1.8 expression is feedback regulated by ethylene. Our studies provide insight into the regulation of ACS5 and ethylene biosynthesis.

Abstract: The course of histopathological alterations within jejunal graft architecture during the initial adaptation phase in the host body was investigated. Graft tissues were compared to the intestinal tissues of the recipients. This study demonstrates: (1) renewal of intestinal epithelial lining in the graft biopsies during initial hours after transplantation is more likely caused by migration and extension of remaining epithelial cells than by their increased mitotic division. (2) Distinct decrease in histopathological injury was observed in transplanted grafts after 6h, but the morphometrical parameters, particularly villus height and wall thickness, remained altered. (3) Significant decrease in apoptotic cell death in the epithelial lining within 6h of graft recirculation was accompanied by no effect on apoptosis levels of the cells in lamina propria connective tissue. (4) Although the apoptosis level in the connective tissue cells was not modulated in the grafts within the first hour after transplantation, caspase-3 dependent apoptosis was decreased significantly.

Abstract: This study was to investigate the mechanism and role of Kif4A in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in breast cancer. Using two human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (with wild-type p53) and MDA-MB-231 (with mutant p53), we quantitated the expression levels of kinesin super-family protein 4A (Kif4A) and poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1 (PARP-1) by Western blot after doxorubicin treatment and examined the apoptosis by flow cytometry after treatment with doxorubicin and PARP-1 inhibitor, 3-Aminobenzamide (3-ABA). Our results showed that doxorubicin treatment could induce the apoptosis of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, the down-regulation of Kif4A and upregulation of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). The activity of PARP-1 or PARP-1 activation was significantly elevated by doxorubicin treatment in dose- and time-dependent manners (P < 0.05), while doxorubicin treatment only slightly elevated the level of cleaved fragments of PARP-1 (P > 0.05). We further demonstrated that overexpression of Kif4A could reduce the level of PAR and significantly increase apoptosis. The effect of doxorubicin on apoptosis was more profound in MCF-7 cells compared with MDA-MB-231 cells (P < 0.05). Taken together, our results suggest that the novel role of Kif4A in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells is achieved by inhibiting the activity of PARP-1.

Abstract: Summary
The nuclear factor κB (NF-κΒ) subunits RelA, RelB, cRel, p50, and p52 are each critical for B cell development and function. To systematically characterize their responses to canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathway activity, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis in lymphoblastoid B cell lines (LCLs). We found a complex NF-κB-binding landscape, which did not readily reflect the two NF-κB pathway paradigms. Instead, 10 subunit-binding patterns were observed at promoters and 11 at enhancers. Nearly one-third of NF-κB-binding sites lacked κB motifs and were instead enriched for alternative motifs. The oncogenic forkhead box protein FOXM1 co-occupied nearly half of NF-κB-binding sites and was identified in protein complexes with NF-κB on DNA. FOXM1 knockdown decreased NF-κB target gene expression and ultimately induced apoptosis, highlighting FOXM1 as a synthetic lethal target in B cell malignancy. These studies provide a resource for understanding mechanisms that underlie NF-κB nuclear activity and highlight opportunities for selective NF-κB blockade.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosomes stalled on aberrant mRNAs engage quality control mechanisms that degrade the partially translated nascent polypeptide. Ubiquitination of the nascent protein is mediated by the E3 ligase Listerin via a mechanism involving ribosome subunit dissociation. Here, we reconstitute ribosome-associated ubiquitination with purified factors to define the minimal components and essential steps in this process. We find that the primary role of the ribosome splitting factors Hbs1, Pelota, and ABCE1 is to permit Listerin access to the nascent chain. Listerin alone can discriminate 60S- from 80S-nascent chain complexes to selectively ubiquitinate the former. Splitting factors can be bypassed by artificially removing the 40S subunit, suggesting that mere steric hindrance impedes Listerin recruitment. This was illustrated by a cryo-EM reconstruction of the 60S-Listerin complex that identifies a binding interface that clashes with the 40S ribosomal subunit. These results reveal the mechanistic logic of the core steps in a ribosome-associated quality control pathway.

Abstract: Summary
The extreme anterior domain (EAD) is a conserved embryonic region that includes the presumptive mouth. We show that the Kinin-Kallikrein pathway is active in the EAD and necessary for craniofacial development in Xenopus and zebrafish. The mouth failed to form and neural crest (NC) development and migration was abnormal after loss of function (LOF) in the pathway genes kng, encoding Bradykinin (xBdk), carboxypeptidase-N (cpn), which cleaves Bradykinin, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Consistent with a role for nitric oxide (NO) in face formation, endogenous NO levels declined after LOF in pathway genes, but these were restored and a normal face formed after medial implantation of xBdk-beads into LOF embryos. Facial transplants demonstrated that Cpn function from within the EAD is necessary for the migration of first arch cranial NC into the face and for promoting mouth opening. The study identifies the EAD as an essential craniofacial organizer acting through Kinin-Kallikrein signaling.

Abstract: Summary
In eukaryotic cells, DNA replication proceeds with continuous synthesis of leading-strand DNA and discontinuous synthesis of lagging-strand DNA. Here we describe a method, eSPAN (enrichment and sequencing of protein-associated nascent DNA), which reveals the genome-wide association of proteins with leading and lagging strands of DNA replication forks. Using this approach in budding yeast, we confirm the strand specificities of DNA polymerases delta and epsilon and show that the PCNA clamp is enriched at lagging strands compared with leading-strand replication. Surprisingly, at stalled forks, PCNA is unloaded specifically from lagging strands. PCNA unloading depends on the Elg1-containing alternative RFC complex, ubiquitination of PCNA, and the checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Rad53. Cells deficient in PCNA unloading exhibit increased chromosome breaks. Our studies provide a tool for studying replication-related processes and reveal a mechanism whereby checkpoint kinases regulate strand-specific unloading of PCNA from stalled replication forks to maintain genome stability.

Abstract: Summary
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with high mortality, and the identification of effective pharmacological strategies to target SCLC biology represents an urgent need. Using a high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse chemical library, we observe that SCLC is sensitive to transcription-targeting drugs, in particular to THZ1, a recently identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7. We find that expression of super-enhancer-associated transcription factor genes, including MYC family proto-oncogenes and neuroendocrine lineage-specific factors, is highly vulnerability to THZ1 treatment. We propose that downregulation of these transcription factors contributes, in part, to SCLC sensitivity to transcriptional inhibitors and that THZ1 represents a prototype drug for tailored SCLC therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-specific pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is instrumental in both aerobic glycolysis and gene transcription. PKM2 regulates G1-S phase transition by controlling cyclin D1 expression. However, it is not known whether PKM2 directly controls cell-cycle progression. We show here that PKM2, but not PKM1, binds to the spindle checkpoint protein Bub3 during mitosis and phosphorylates Bub3 at Y207. This phosphorylation is required for Bub3-Bub1 complex recruitment to kinetochores, where it interacts with Blinkin and is essential for correct kinetochore-microtubule attachment, mitotic/spindle-assembly checkpoint, accurate chromosome segregation, cell survival and proliferation, and active EGF receptor-induced brain tumorigenesis. In addition, the level of Bub3 Y207 phosphorylation correlated with histone H3-S10 phosphorylation in human glioblastoma specimens and with glioblastoma prognosis. These findings highlight the role of PKM2 as a protein kinase controlling the fidelity of chromosome segregation, cell-cycle progression, and tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
Dolichol is an obligate carrier of glycans for N-linked protein glycosylation, O-mannosylation, and GPI anchor biosynthesis. cis-prenyltransferase (cis-PTase) is the first enzyme committed to the synthesis of dolichol. However, the proteins responsible for mammalian cis-PTase activity have not been delineated. Here we show that Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) is a subunit required for dolichol synthesis in yeast, mice, and man. Moreover, we describe a family with a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by a loss of function mutation in the conserved C terminus of NgBR-R290H and show that fibroblasts isolated from patients exhibit reduced dolichol profiles and enhanced accumulation of free cholesterol identically to fibroblasts from mice lacking NgBR. Mutation of NgBR-R290H in man and orthologs in yeast proves the importance of this evolutionarily conserved residue for mammalian cis-PTase activity and function. Thus, these data provide a genetic basis for the essential role of NgBR in dolichol synthesis and protein glycosylation.

Abstract: Summary
Death receptor agonist therapies have exhibited limited clinical benefit to date. Investigations into why Apo2L/TRAIL and AMG 655 preclinical data were not predictive of clinical response revealed that coadministration of Apo2L/TRAIL with AMG 655 leads to increased antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. The combination of Apo2L/TRAIL and AMG 655 results in enhanced signaling and can sensitize Apo2L/TRAIL-resistant cells. Structure determination of the Apo2L/TRAIL-DR5-AMG 655 ternary complex illustrates how higher order clustering of DR5 is achieved when both agents are combined. Enhanced agonism generated by combining Apo2L/TRAIL and AMG 655 provides insight into the limited efficacy observed in previous clinical trials and suggests testable hypotheses to reconsider death receptor agonism as a therapeutic strategy.

Abstract: Summary
AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast neurotransmission at excitatory synapses. The extent and fidelity of postsynaptic depolarization triggered by AMPAR activation are shaped by AMPAR auxiliary subunits, including the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). TARPs profoundly influence gating, an effect thought to be mediated by an interaction with the AMPAR ion channel and ligand binding domain (LBD). Here, we show that the distal N-terminal domain (NTD) contributes to TARP modulation. Alterations in the NTD-LBD linker result in TARP-dependent and TARP-selective changes in AMPAR gating. Using peptide arrays, we identify a TARP interaction region on the NTD and define the path of TARP contacts along the LBD surface. Moreover, we map key binding sites on the TARP itself and show that mutation of these residues mediates gating modulation. Our data reveal a TARP-dependent allosteric role for the AMPAR NTD and suggest that TARP binding triggers a drastic reorganization of the AMPAR complex.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic studies have established anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase, as a tractable molecular target in neuroblastoma. We describe comprehensive genomic, biochemical, and computational analyses of ALK mutations across 1,596 diagnostic neuroblastoma samples. ALK tyrosine kinase domain mutations occurred in 8% of samples—at three hot spots and 13 minor sites—and correlated significantly with poorer survival in high- and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. Biochemical and computational studies distinguished oncogenic (constitutively activating) from nononcogenic mutations and allowed robust computational prediction of their effects. The mutated variants also showed differential in vitro crizotinib sensitivities. Our studies identify ALK genomic status as a clinically important therapeutic stratification tool in neuroblastoma and will allow tailoring of ALK-targeted therapy to specific mutations.

Abstract: Summary
To establish highly precise patterns of neural connectivity, developing axons must stop growing at their appropriate destinations and specifically synapse with target cells. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these sequential steps remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that cadherin-7 (Cdh7) plays a dual role in axonal growth termination and specific synapse formation during the development of the cerebellar mossy fiber circuit. Cdh7 is expressed in mossy fiber pontine nucleus (PN) neurons and their target cerebellar granule neurons during synaptogenesis and selectively mediates synapse formation between those neurons. Additionally, Cdh7 presented by mature granule neurons diminishes the growth potential of PN axons. Furthermore, knockdown of Cdh7 in PN neurons in vivo severely impairs the connectivity of PN axons in the developing cerebellum. These findings reveal a mechanism by which a single bifunctional cell-surface receptor orchestrates precise wiring by regulating axonal growth potential and synaptic specificity.

Abstract: Summary
Oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), occur with high frequency in breast cancer. The protein kinase Akt is considered to be the primary effector of PIK3CA, although mechanisms by which PI3K mediates Akt-independent tumorigenic signals remain obscure. We show that serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 3 (SGK3) is amplified in breast cancer and activated downstream of PIK3CA in a manner dependent on the phosphoinositide phosphatase INPP4B. Expression of INPP4B leads to enhanced SGK3 activation and suppression of Akt phosphorylation. Activation of SGK3 downstream of PIK3CA and INPP4B is required for 3D proliferation, invasive migration, and tumorigenesis in vivo. We further show that SGK3 targets the metastasis suppressor NDRG1 for degradation by Fbw7. We propose a model in which breast cancers harboring oncogenic PIK3CA activate SGK3 signaling while suppressing Akt, indicative of oncogenic functions for both INPP4B and SGK3 in these tumors.

Abstract: Summary
The molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal leptin and insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes remain unclear. Here we show that induction of the unfolded protein response transcription factor spliced X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1s) in pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) neurons alone is sufficient to protect against diet-induced obesity as well as improve leptin and insulin sensitivity, even in the presence of strong activators of ER stress. We also demonstrate that constitutive expression of Xbp1s in Pomc neurons contributes to improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and suppression of endogenous glucose production. Notably, elevated Xbp1s levels in Pomc neurons also resulted in activation of the Xbp1s axis in the liver via a cell-nonautonomous mechanism. Together our results identify critical molecular mechanisms linking ER stress in arcuate Pomc neurons to acute leptin and insulin resistance as well as liver metabolism in diet-induced obesity and diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
Despite the development of potent RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors, only a fraction of BRAF-mutant patients benefit from treatment with these drugs. Using a combined chemogenomics and chemoproteomics approach, we identify drug-induced RAS-RAF-MEK complex formation in a subset of BRAF-mutant cancer cells characterized by primary resistance to vemurafenib. In these cells, autocrine interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion may contribute to the primary resistance phenotype via induction of JAK/STAT3 and MAPK signaling. In a subset of cell lines, combined IL-6/MAPK inhibition is able to overcome primary resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy. Overall, we show that the signaling plasticity exerted by primary resistant BRAF-mutant cells is achieved by their ability to mimic signaling features of oncogenic RAS, a strategy that we term “oncogene mimicry.” This model may guide future strategies for overcoming primary resistance observed in these tumors.

Frequent Interchromosomal Template Switches during Gene Conversion in S. cerevisiae,

Abstract: Summary
Although repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by gene conversion is the most accurate way to repair such lesions, in budding yeast there is a 1,000-fold increase in accompanying mutations, including interchromosomal template switches (ICTS) involving highly mismatched (homeologous) ectopic sequences. Although such events are rare and appear at a rate of 2 × 10−7 when template jumps occur between 71% identical sequences, they are surprisingly frequent (0.3% of all repair events) when the second template is identical to the first, revealing the remarkable instability of repair DNA synthesis. With homeologous donors, ICTS uses microhomologies as small as 2 bp. Cells lacking mismatch repair proteins Msh6 and Mlh1 form chimeric recombinants with two distinct patches of microhomology, implying that these proteins are crucial for strand discrimination of heteroduplex DNA formed during ICTS. We identify the chromatin remodeler Rdh54 as the first protein required for template switching that does not affect simple gene conversion.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs are abundant in animal genomes, yet little is known about their functions in vivo. Here, we report the production of 80 new Drosophila miRNA mutants by targeted homologous recombination. These mutants remove 104 miRNAs. Together with 15 previously reported mutants, this collection includes 95 mutants deleting 130 miRNAs. Collectively, these genes produce over 99% of all Drosophila miRNAs, measured by miRNA sequence reads. We present a survey of developmental and adult miRNA phenotypes. Over 80% of the mutants showed at least one phenotype using a p < 0.01 significance threshold. We observed a significant correlation between miRNA abundance and phenotypes related to survival and lifespan, but not to most other phenotypes. miRNA cluster mutants were no more likely than single miRNA mutants to produce significant phenotypes. This mutant collection will provide a resource for future analysis of the biological roles of Drosophila miRNAs.

Abstract: Summary
Widely transcribed compact genomes must cope with the major challenge of frequent overlapping or concurrent transcription events. Efficient and timely transcription termination is crucial to control pervasive transcription and prevent transcriptional interference. In yeast, transcription termination of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occurs via two possible pathways that both require recognition of termination signals on nascent RNA by specific factors. We describe here an additional mechanism of transcription termination for RNAPII and demonstrate its biological significance. We show that the transcriptional activator Reb1p bound to DNA is a roadblock for RNAPII, which pauses and is ubiquitinated, thus triggering termination. Reb1p-dependent termination generates a class of cryptic transcripts that are degraded in the nucleus by the exosome. We also observed transcriptional interference between neighboring genes in the absence of Reb1p. This work demonstrates the importance of roadblock termination for controlling pervasive transcription and preventing transcription through gene regulatory regions.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation in promoters is well known to silence genes and is the presumed therapeutic target of methylation inhibitors. Gene body methylation is positively correlated with expression, yet its function is unknown. We show that 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment not only reactivates genes but decreases the overexpression of genes, many of which are involved in metabolic processes regulated by c-MYC. Downregulation is caused by DNA demethylation of the gene bodies and restoration of high levels of expression requires remethylation by DNMT3B. Gene body methylation may, therefore, be an unexpected therapeutic target for DNA methylation inhibitors, resulting in the normalization of gene overexpression induced during carcinogenesis. Our results provide direct evidence for a causal relationship between gene body methylation and transcription.

Abstract: Fine structure of the midgut and degeneration of the midgut epithelium of the scorpionfly Sinopanorpa tincta (Navás) adults were investigated using light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the tubular midgut lacks gastric caeca and is composed of an outer longitudinal and an inner circular muscle layer, a basal lamina, an epithelium and a lumen from the outside to inside. A peritrophic membrane was not found in the lumen. A mass of nodules was observed on the surface of the basal lamina. Three types of cells were recognized in the epithelium: digestive, secretory, and regenerative cells. The digestive cells contain irregular-shaped infoldings in the basal membrane and two types of microvilli in the apical membrane. The secretory cells are characterized by irregular shape and large quantities of secretory granules in the basal cytoplasm. The regenerative cells are triangular in shape and distributed only in the nodules. The epithelial cells are degenerated through programmed cell-death mechanisms (apoptosis and necrosis). The type, function, and degeneration of the epithelial cells of the midgut are briefly discussed.

Abstract: Summary
Neocortical neurons with similar functional properties assemble into spatially coherent circuits, but it remains unclear how inhibitory interneurons are organized. We applied in vivo two-photon functional Ca2+ imaging and whole-cell recording of synaptic currents to record visual responses of cortical neurons and analyzed their spatial arrangements. GABAergic interneurons were clustered in the 3D space of the mouse visual cortex, and excitatory neurons located within the clusters (insiders) had a lower amplitude and sharper orientation tuning of visual responses than outsiders. Inhibitory synaptic currents recorded from the insiders were larger than those of the outsiders. Single, isolated interneurons did not show such a location-tuning/amplitude relationship. The two principal subtypes of interneurons, parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing neurons, also formed clusters with only slightly overlapping each other and exhibited a different location-tuning relationship. These findings suggest that GABAergic interneurons and their subgroups form clusters to make their inhibitory function more effective than isolated interneurons.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential for regulation of gene expression. Though numerous miRNAs have been identified by high-throughput sequencing, few precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) are experimentally validated. Here we report a strategy for constructing high-throughput sequencing libraries enriched for full-length pre-miRNAs. We find widespread and extensive uridylation of Argonaute (Ago)-bound pre-miRNAs, which is primarily catalyzed by two terminal uridylyltransferases: TUT7 and TUT4. Uridylation by TUT7/4 not only polishes pre-miRNA 3′ ends, but also facilitates their degradation by the exosome, preventing clogging of Ago with defective species. We show that the exosome exploits distinct substrate preferences of DIS3 and RRP6, its two catalytic subunits, to distinguish productive from defective pre-miRNAs. Furthermore, we identify a positive feedback loop formed by the exosome and TUT7/4 in triggering uridylation and degradation of Ago-bound pre-miRNAs. Our study reveals a pre-miRNA surveillance system that comprises TUT7, TUT4, and the exosome in quality control of miRNA synthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Homeotic (HOX) genes are dysregulated in multiple malignancies, including several AML subtypes. We demonstrate that H3K79 dimethylation (H3K79me2) is converted to monomethylation (H3K79me1) at HOX loci as hematopoietic cells mature, thus coinciding with a decrease in HOX gene expression. We show that H3K79 methyltransferase activity as well as H3K79me1-to-H3K79me2 conversion is regulated by the DOT1L cofactor AF10. AF10 inactivation reverses leukemia-associated epigenetic profiles, precludes abnormal HOXA gene expression, and impairs the transforming ability of MLL-AF9, MLL-AF6, and NUP98-NSD1 fusions—mechanistically distinct HOX-activating oncogenes. Furthermore, NUP98-NSD1-transformed cells are sensitive to small-molecule inhibition of DOT1L. Our findings demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of the DOT1L/AF10 complex may provide therapeutic benefits in an array of malignancies with abnormal HOXA gene expression.

Abstract: Summary
Organisms need to assess their nutritional state and adapt their digestive capacity to the demands for various nutrients. Modulation of digestive enzyme production represents a rational step to regulate nutriment uptake. However, the role of digestion in nutrient homeostasis has been largely neglected. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism underlying glucose repression of digestive enzymes in the adult Drosophila midgut. We demonstrate that glucose represses the expression of many carbohydrases and lipases. Our data reveal that the consumption of nutritious sugars stimulates the secretion of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) ligand, Dawdle, from the fat body. Dawdle then acts via circulation to activate TGF-β/Activin signaling in the midgut, culminating in the repression of digestive enzymes that are highly expressed during starvation. Thus, our study not only identifies a mechanism that couples sugar sensing with digestive enzyme expression but points to an important role of TGF-β/Activin signaling in sugar metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely expressed noncoding RNAs. However, their biogenesis and possible functions are poorly understood. Here, by studying circRNAs that we identified in neuronal tissues, we provide evidence that animal circRNAs are generated cotranscriptionally and that their production rate is mainly determined by intronic sequences. We demonstrate that circularization and splicing compete against each other. These mechanisms are tissue specific and conserved in animals. Interestingly, we observed that the second exon of the splicing factor muscleblind (MBL/MBNL1) is circularized in flies and humans. This circRNA (circMbl) and its flanking introns contain conserved muscleblind binding sites, which are strongly and specifically bound by MBL. Modulation of MBL levels strongly affects circMbl biosynthesis, and this effect is dependent on the MBL binding sites. Together, our data suggest that circRNAs can function in gene regulation by competing with linear splicing. Furthermore, we identified muscleblind as a factor involved in circRNA biogenesis.

Abstract: Histone modifications on major transcription factor target genes are one of the major regulatory mechanisms controlling adipogenesis. Plant homeodomain finger 2 (PHF2) is a Jumonji domain-containing protein and is known to demethylate the histone H3K9, a repressive gene marker. To better understand the function of PHF2 in adipocyte differentiation, we constructed stable PHF2 knock-down cells by using the mouse pre-adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1. When induced with adipogenic media, PHF2 knock-down cells showed reduced lipid accumulation compared to control cells. Differential expression using a cDNA microarray revealed significant reduction of metabolic pathway genes in the PHF2 knock-down cell line after differentiation. The reduced expression of major transcription factors and adipokines was confirmed with reverse transcription- quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. We further performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis of PHF2 with four major adipogenic transcription factors, and we found that CCATT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)α and C/EBPδ physically interact with PHF2. In addition, PHF2 binding to target gene promoters was confirmed with a chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment. Finally, histone H3K9 methylation markers on the PHF2-binding sequences were increased in PHF2 knock-down cells after differentiation. Together, these results demonstrate that PHF2 histone demethylase controls adipogenic gene expression during differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
Germline mutations of BRCA1 confer hereditary susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. However, somatic mutation of BRCA1 is infrequent in sporadic breast cancers. The BRCA1 protein C terminus (BRCT) domains interact with multiple proteins and are required for BRCA1’s tumor-suppressor function. In this study, we demonstrated that Abraxas, a BRCA1 BRCT domain-interacting protein, plays a role in tumor suppression. Abraxas exerts its function through binding to BRCA1 to regulate DNA repair and maintain genome stability. Both homozygous and heterozygous Abraxas knockout mice exhibited decreased survival and increased tumor incidence. The gene encoding Abraxas suffers from gene copy loss and somatic mutations in multiple human cancers including breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, suggesting that mutation and loss of function of Abraxas may contribute to tumor development in human patients.

Abstract: Summary
Persistent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are recruited to the nuclear periphery in budding yeast. Both the Nup84 pore subcomplex and Mps3, an inner nuclear membrane (INM) SUN domain protein, have been implicated in DSB binding. It was unclear what, if anything, distinguishes the two potential sites of repair. Here, we characterize and distinguish the two binding sites. First, DSB-pore interaction occurs independently of cell-cycle phase and requires neither the chromatin remodeler INO80 nor recombinase Rad51 activity. In contrast, Mps3 binding is S and G2 phase specific and requires both factors. SWR1-dependent incorporation of Htz1 (H2A.Z) is necessary for break relocation to either site in both G1- and S-phase cells. Importantly, functional assays indicate that mutations in the two sites have additive repair defects, arguing that the two perinuclear anchorage sites define distinct survival pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of Pax3, a developmentally regulated transcription factor expressed in premigratory neural crest, results in severe developmental defects and embryonic lethality. Although Pax3 mutations produce profound phenotypes, the intrinsic transcriptional activation exhibited by Pax3 is surprisingly modest. We postulated the existence of transcriptional coactivators that function with Pax3 to mediate developmental functions. A high-throughput screen identified the Hippo effector proteins Taz and Yap65 as Pax3 coactivators. Synergistic coactivation of target genes by Pax3-Taz/Yap65 requires DNA binding by Pax3, is Tead independent, and is regulated by Hippo kinases Mst1 and Lats2. In vivo, Pax3 and Yap65 colocalize in the nucleus of neural crest progenitors in the dorsal neural tube. Neural crest deletion of Taz and Yap65 results in embryo-lethal neural crest defects and decreased expression of the Pax3 target gene, Mitf. These results suggest that Pax3 activity is regulated by the Hippo pathway and that Pax factors are Hippo effectors.

Abstract: Summary
We describe the landscape of somatic genomic alterations of 66 chromophobe renal cell carcinomas (ChRCCs) on the basis of multidimensional and comprehensive characterization, including mtDNA and whole-genome sequencing. The result is consistent that ChRCC originates from the distal nephron compared with other kidney cancers with more proximal origins. Combined mtDNA and gene expression analysis implicates changes in mitochondrial function as a component of the disease biology, while suggesting alternative roles for mtDNA mutations in cancers relying on oxidative phosphorylation. Genomic rearrangements lead to recurrent structural breakpoints within TERT promoter region, which correlates with highly elevated TERT expression and manifestation of kataegis, representing a mechanism of TERT upregulation in cancer distinct from previously observed amplifications and point mutations.

Abstract: Summary
The strength of conclusions drawn from RNAi-based studies is heavily influenced by the quality of tools used to elicit knockdown. Prior studies have developed algorithms to design siRNAs. However, to date, no established method has emerged to identify effective shRNAs, which have lower intracellular abundance than transfected siRNAs and undergo additional processing steps. We recently developed a multiplexed assay for identifying potent shRNAs and used this method to generate ∼250,000 shRNA efficacy data points. Using these data, we developed shERWOOD, an algorithm capable of predicting, for any shRNA, the likelihood that it will elicit potent target knockdown. Combined with additional shRNA design strategies, shERWOOD allows the ab initio identification of potent shRNAs that specifically target the majority of each gene’s multiple transcripts. We validated the performance of our shRNA designs using several orthogonal strategies and constructed genome-wide collections of shRNAs for humans and mice based on our approach.

Abstract: Summary
Chromatin organization and dynamics are integral to global gene transcription. Histone modification influences chromatin status and gene expression. PTEN plays multiple roles in tumor suppression, development, and metabolism. Here, we report on the interplay of PTEN, histone H1, and chromatin. We show that loss of PTEN leads to dissociation of histone H1 from chromatin and decondensation of chromatin. PTEN deletion also results in elevation of histone H4 acetylation at lysine 16, an epigenetic marker for chromatin activation. We found that PTEN and histone H1 physically interact through their C-terminal domains. Disruption of the PTEN C terminus promotes the chromatin association of MOF acetyltransferase and induces H4K16 acetylation. Hyperacetylation of H4K16 impairs the association of PTEN with histone H1, which constitutes regulatory feedback that may reduce chromatin stability. Our results demonstrate that PTEN controls chromatin condensation, thus influencing gene expression. We propose that PTEN regulates global gene transcription profiling through histones and chromatin remodeling.

Abstract: Summary
Although pathogens must infect differentiated host cells that exhibit substantial diversity, documenting the consequences of infection against this heterogeneity is challenging. Single-cell mass cytometry permits deep profiling based on combinatorial expression of surface and intracellular proteins. We used this method to investigate varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection of tonsil T cells, which mediate viral transport to skin. Our results indicate that VZV induces a continuum of changes regardless of basal phenotypic and functional T cell characteristics. Contrary to the premise that VZV selectively infects T cells with skin trafficking profiles, VZV infection altered T cell surface proteins to enhance or induce these properties. Zap70 and Akt signaling pathways that trigger such surface changes were activated in VZV-infected naive and memory cells by a T cell receptor (TCR)-independent process. Single-cell mass cytometry is likely to be broadly relevant for demonstrating how intracellular pathogens modulate differentiated cells to support pathogenesis in the natural host.

Abstract: Summary
Numerous oncogenic mutations occur within the BRAF kinase domain (BRAFKD). Here we show that stable BRAF-MEK1 complexes are enriched in BRAFWT and KRAS mutant (MT) cells but not in BRAFMT cells. The crystal structure of the BRAFKD in a complex with MEK1 reveals a face-to-face dimer sensitive to MEK1 phosphorylation but insensitive to BRAF dimerization. Structure-guided studies reveal that oncogenic BRAF mutations function by bypassing the requirement for BRAF dimerization for activity or weakening the interaction with MEK1. Finally, we show that conformation-specific BRAF inhibitors can sequester a dormant BRAF-MEK1 complex resulting in pathway inhibition. Taken together, these findings reveal a regulatory role for BRAF in the MAPK pathway independent of its kinase activity but dependent on interaction with MEK.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in cancer progression, but the precise mechanisms by which stromal cells influence the epithelium are poorly understood. Here we show that p62 levels were reduced in the stroma of several tumors and that its loss in the tumor microenvironment or stromal fibroblasts resulted in increased tumorigenesis of epithelial prostate cancer cells. The mechanism involves the regulation of cellular redox through an mTORC1/c-Myc pathway of stromal glucose and amino acid metabolism, resulting in increased stromal IL-6 production, which is required for tumor promotion in the epithelial compartment. Thus, p62 is an anti-inflammatory tumor suppressor that acts through the modulation of metabolism in the tumor stroma.

Bcl-2 Family Proteins Participate in Mitochondrial Quality Control by Regulating Parkin/PINK1-Dependent Mitophagy,

Abstract: Summary
Mitophagy facilitates the selective elimination of impaired or depolarized mitochondria through targeting the latter to autophagosomes. Parkin becomes localized to depolarized mitochondria in a PINK1-dependent manner and polyubiquitinates multiple mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. This permits ubiquitin-binding proteins (e.g., p62 and NBR1) to target impaired mitochondria to autophagosomes via Atg8/LC3II. Bcl-2 family proteins regulate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization during apoptosis and can also influence macroautophagy via interactions with Beclin-1. Here, we show that Parkin-dependent mitophagy is antagonized by prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family (e.g., Bcl-xL and Mcl-1) in a Beclin-1-independent manner. Bcl-2 proteins suppressed mitophagy through inhibition of Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria. Consistent with this, Parkin translocation to mitochondria was enhanced by BH3-only proteins or a BH3-only mimetic. Taken together with their role as regulators of apoptosis-associated mitochondrial permeabilization, as well as mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics, this suggests that Bcl-2 family proteins act as global regulators of mitochondrial homeostasis.

Evidence for accumulation of Synechococcus elongatus (Cyanobacteria: Cyanophyceae) in the tissues of the oyster Crassostrea gigas (Mollusca: Bivalvia),

Abstract: Cyanobacteria appear to have direct relations with mollusks in several aspects. This is the first time, distinguishing Gram-negative cyanoprokaryotic Synechococcus elongatus as bright yellow-gold autofluorescence by Lillie's and Hiss’ staining methods on paraffin-embedded tissues of Crassostrea gigas. Three diets: cyanoprokaryotes, cyanoprokaryotes with microalgae, and only microalgae were evaluated. Cyanoprokaryotes were intact, densely bundled, and immersed in the cytosol of the digestive gland, connective tissue, mantle, and gonad of C. gigas, revealing an accumulation systemic without tissue damage observed by histology. Unexpectedly, cyanoprokaryotes were slightly most accumulated with microalgae diet by each of the tissues of the C. gigas than with any other diets. Cyanoprokaryotes tend to be in mean slightly higher in the digestive gland than in any other tissues respectively for each diet, although these values are closely similar to connective tissue. A possible order of exposure of the oyster tissues to accumulation of cyanoprokaryotes was digestive gland, connective tissue, mantle, and gonad. Thereby, the digestive gland could be the major target tissue for the accumulation. Our observations provide a valuable insight regarding the ability of cyanoprokaryotes to penetrate, spread, and remain inside the oyster tissues, suggesting for S. elongatus: (1) a pre-accumulation in oyster tissues from the natural environment, (2) a phagocytosis and/or endocytosis process rather than ingestion and extracellular digestion, (3) an apparent cellular division in the cytosol of oyster tissues, (4) an apparent inter-tissue movement, and (5) a possible endosymbiosis between C. gigas and S. elongatus. Hereby, it is possible that S. elongatus have a well-developed host–endobiont relationship with oysters, and thereby support future work toward a description of the escape and spreading mechanisms of S. elongatus inside the tissues of mollusks, and put forward questions as why it is there? and are the cells active or inactive?

Abstract: Summary
Amino acid (AA) is a potent mitogen that controls growth and metabolism. Here we describe the identification of Rab1 as a conserved regulator of AA signaling to mTORC1. AA stimulates Rab1A GTP binding and interaction with mTORC1 and Rheb-mTORC1 interaction in the Golgi. Rab1A overexpression promotes mTORC1 signaling and oncogenic growth in an AA- and mTORC1-dependent manner. Conversely, Rab1A knockdown selectively attenuates oncogenic growth of Rab1-overexpressing cancer cells. Moreover, Rab1A is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), which is correlated with elevated mTORC1 signaling, tumor invasion, progression, and poor prognosis. Our results demonstrate that Rab1 is an mTORC1 activator and an oncogene and that hyperactive AA signaling through Rab1A overexpression drives oncogenesis and renders cancer cells prone to mTORC1-targeted therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) is a critical determinant of obesity-associated inflammation and glucose intolerance. The upstream mechanisms controlling this pathway are still unknown. Here we report that the levels of the PB1 domain-containing adaptor NBR1 correlated with the expression of proinflammatory molecules in adipose tissue from human patients with metabolic syndrome, suggesting that NBR1 plays a key role in adipose-tissue inflammation. We also show that NBR1 inactivation in the myeloid compartment impairs the function, M1 polarization, and chemotactic activity of macrophages; prevents inflammation of adipose tissue; and improves glucose tolerance in obese mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an interaction between the PB1 domains of NBR1 and the mitogen-activated kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3) enables the formation of a signaling complex required for the activation of JNK. Together, these discoveries identify an NBR1-MEKK3 complex as a key regulator of JNK signaling and adipose tissue inflammation in obesity.

Abstract: Summary
The tumor suppressor protein BRCA1 promotes homologous recombination (HR), a high-fidelity mechanism to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that arise during normal replication and in response to DNA-damaging agents. Recent genetic experiments indicate that BRCA1 also performs an HR-independent function during the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Here we show that BRCA1 is required to unload the CMG helicase complex from chromatin after replication forks collide with an ICL. Eviction of the stalled helicase allows leading strands to be extended toward the ICL, followed by endonucleolytic processing of the crosslink, lesion bypass, and DSB repair. Our results identify BRCA1-dependent helicase unloading as a critical, early event in ICL repair.

Abstract: Summary
There is growing recognition of cerebrovascular contributions to neurodegenerative diseases. In the walls of cerebral arteries, amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation is evident in a majority of aged people and patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Here, we leverage human pluripotent stem cells to generate vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from neural crest progenitors, recapitulating brain-vasculature-specific attributes of Aβ metabolism. We confirm that the lipoprotein receptor, LRP1, functions in our neural-crest-derived SMCs to mediate Aβ uptake and intracellular lysosomal degradation. Hypoxia significantly compromises the contribution of SMCs to Aβ clearance by suppressing LRP1 expression. This enabled us to develop an assay of Aβ uptake by using the neural crest-derived SMCs with hypoxia as a stress paradigm. We then tested several vascular protective compounds in a high-throughput format, demonstrating the value of stem-cell-based phenotypic screening for novel therapeutics and drug repurposing, aimed at alleviating amyloid burden.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside within a specialized niche where interactions with vasculature, osteoblasts, and stromal components regulate their self-renewal and differentiation. Little is known about bone marrow niche formation or the role of its cellular components in HSC development; therefore, we established the timing of murine fetal long bone vascularization and ossification relative to the onset of HSC activity. Adult-repopulating HSCs emerged at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5), coincident with marrow vascularization, and were contained within the c-Kit+Sca-1+Lin− (KSL) population. We used Osterix-null (Osx−/−) mice that form vascularized marrow but lack osteolineage cells to dissect the role(s) of these cellular components in HSC development. Osx−/− fetal bone marrow cells formed multilineage colonies in vitro but were hyperproliferative and failed to home to and/or engraft transplant recipients. Thus, in developing bone marrow, the vasculature can sustain multilineage progenitors, but interactions with osteolineage cells are needed to regulate long-term HSC proliferation and potential.

Abstract: Summary
The Rab GTPases recruit peripheral membrane proteins to intracellular organelles. These Rab effectors typically mediate the motility of organelles and vesicles and contribute to the specificity of membrane traffic. However, for many Rabs, few, if any, effectors have been identified; hence, their role remains unclear. To identify Rab effectors, we used a comprehensive set of Drosophila Rabs for affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry to identify the proteins bound to each Rab. For many Rabs, this revealed specific interactions with Drosophila orthologs of known effectors. In addition, we found numerous Rab-specific interactions with known components of membrane traffic as well as with diverse proteins not previously linked to organelles or having no known function. We confirm over 25 interactions for Rab2, Rab4, Rab5, Rab6, Rab7, Rab9, Rab18, Rab19, Rab30, and Rab39. These include tethering complexes, coiled-coiled proteins, motor linkers, Rab regulators, and several proteins linked to human disease.

Abstract: Summary
Self-renewal and proliferation of nephron progenitor cells and the decision to initiate nephrogenesis are crucial events directing kidney development. Despite recent advancements in defining lineage and regulators for the progenitors, fundamental questions about mechanisms driving expansion of the progenitors remain unanswered. Here we show that Eya1 interacts with Six2 and Myc to control self-renewing cell activity. Cell fate tracing reveals a developmental restriction of the Eya1+ population within the intermediate mesoderm to nephron-forming cell fates and a common origin shared between caudal mesonephric and metanephric nephrons. Conditional inactivation of Eya1 leads to loss of Six2 expression and premature epithelialization of the progenitors. Six2 mediates translocation of Eya1 to the nucleus, where Eya1 uses its threonine phosphatase activity to control Myc phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and function in the progenitor cells. Our results reveal a functional link between Eya1, Six2, and Myc in driving the expansion and maintenance of the multipotent progenitors during nephrogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
During morphogenesis, extracellular signals trigger actomyosin contractility in subpopulations of cells to coordinate changes in cell shape. To illuminate the link between signaling-mediated tissue patterning and cytoskeletal remodeling, we study the progression of the morphogenetic furrow (MF), the wave of apical constriction that traverses the Drosophila eye imaginal disc preceding photoreceptor neurogenesis. Apical constriction depends on actomyosin contractility downstream of the Hedgehog (Hh) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways. We identify a role for integrin adhesion receptors in MF progression. We show that Hh and BMP regulate integrin expression, the loss of which disrupts apical constriction and slows furrow progression; conversely, elevated integrins accelerate furrow progression. We present evidence that integrins regulate MF progression by promoting microtubule stabilization, since reducing microtubule stability rescues integrin-mediated furrow acceleration. Thus, integrins act as a genetic link between tissue-level signaling events and morphological change at the cellular level, leading to morphogenesis and neurogenesis in the eye.

Abstract: Summary
Neutrophils contain granules loaded with antimicrobial proteins and are regarded as impermeable organelles that deliver cargo via membrane fusion. However, during the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), neutrophil elastase (NE) translocates from the granules to the nucleus via an unknown mechanism that does not involve membrane fusion and requires reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we show that the ROS triggers the dissociation of NE from a membrane-associated complex into the cytosol and activates its proteolytic activity in a myeloperoxidase (MPO)-dependent manner. In the cytosol, NE first binds and degrades F-actin to arrest actin dynamics and subsequently translocates to the nucleus. The complex is an example of an oxidative signaling scaffold that enables ROS and antimicrobial proteins to regulate neutrophil responses. Furthermore, granules contain protein machinery that transports and delivers cargo across membranes independently of membrane fusion.

Abstract: Summary
Different subsets and/or polarized phenotypes of monocytes and macrophages may play distinct roles during the development and resolution of inflammation. Here, we demonstrate in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis that nonclassical Ly6C− monocytes are required for the initiation and progression of sterile joint inflammation. Moreover, nonclassical Ly6C− monocytes differentiate into inflammatory macrophages (M1), which drive disease pathogenesis and display plasticity during the resolution phase. During the development of arthritis, these cells polarize toward an alternatively activated phenotype (M2), promoting the resolution of joint inflammation. The influx of Ly6C− monocytes and their subsequent classical and then alternative activation occurs without changes in synovial tissue-resident macrophages, which express markers of M2 polarization throughout the course of the arthritis and attenuate joint inflammation during the initiation phase. These data suggest that circulating Ly6C− monocytes recruited to the joint upon injury orchestrate the development and resolution of autoimmune joint inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are critical for T cell development and self-tolerance but are gradually lost with age. The existence of thymic epithelial progenitors (TEPCs) in the postnatal thymus has been inferred, but their identity has remained enigmatic. Here, we assessed the entire adult TEC compartment in order to reveal progenitor capacity is retained exclusively within a subset of immature thymic epithelium displaying several hallmark features of stem/progenitor function. These adult TEPCs generate mature cortical and medullary lineages in a stepwise fashion, including Aire+ TEC, within fetal thymus reaggregate grafts. Although relatively quiescent in vivo, adult TEPCs demonstrate significant in vitro colony formation and self-renewal. Importantly, 3D-cultured TEPCs retain their capacity to differentiate into cortical and medullary TEC lineages when returned to an in vivo thymic microenvironment. No other postnatal TEC subset exhibits this combination of properties. The characterization of adult TEPC will enable progress in understanding TEC biology in aging and regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
DNA methylation is a central epigenetic modification that is established by de novo DNA methyltransferases. The mechanisms underlying the generation of genomic methylation patterns are still poorly understood. Using mass spectrometry and a phosphospecific Dnmt3a antibody, we demonstrate that CK2 phosphorylates endogenous Dnmt3a at two key residues located near its PWWP domain, thereby downregulating the ability of Dnmt3a to methylate DNA. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis shows that CK2 primarily modulates CpG methylation of several repeats, most notably of Alu SINEs. This modulation can be directly attributed to CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Dnmt3a. We also find that CK2-mediated phosphorylation is required for localization of Dnmt3a to heterochromatin. By revealing phosphorylation as a mode of regulation of de novo DNA methyltransferase function and by uncovering a mechanism for the regulation of methylation at repetitive elements, our results shed light on the origin of DNA methylation patterns.

Abstract: Summary
The phosphoprotein Dishevelled (Dvl) is a common essential component of Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathways. However, the regulation and significance of Dvl phosphorylation are not fully understood. Here, we show that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (Hipk2) facilitates protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c)-mediated dephosphorylation of Dvl via its C-terminal domain and that this dephosphorylation blocks ubiquitination and consequent degradation mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, which targets the phosphorylated form of Dvl proteins. Inhibition of Hipk2 or PP1c function reduces Dvl protein levels and suppresses Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/PCP pathway-dependent events in mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos, suggesting that Hipk2 and PP1c are essential for maintaining Dvl protein levels that are sufficient to activate Wnt signaling. We also show that Wnt-3a, a Wnt/β-catenin ligand, induces dissociation of the Dvl-Hipk2-PP1c complex and Dvl degradation under high-cell-density conditions. This regulation may be a negative feedback mechanism that fine-tunes Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Metastatic dissemination is often initiated by the reactivation of an embryonic development program referred to as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The transcription factor SNAIL promotes EMT and elicits associated pathological characteristics such as invasion, metastasis, and stemness. To better understand the posttranslational regulation of SNAIL, we performed a luciferase-based, genome-wide E3 ligase siRNA library screen and identified SCF-FBXO11 as an important E3 that targets SNAIL for ubiquitylation and degradation. Furthermore, we discovered that SNAIL degradation by FBXO11 is dependent on Ser-11 phosphorylation of SNAIL by protein kinase D1 (PKD1). FBXO11 blocks SNAIL-induced EMT, tumor initiation, and metastasis in multiple breast cancer models. These findings establish the PKD1-FBXO11-SNAIL axis as a mechanism of posttranslational regulation of EMT and cancer metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
To understand the relationships between the non-GCIMP glioblastoma (GBM) subgroups, we performed mathematical modeling to predict the temporal sequence of driver events during tumorigenesis. The most common order of evolutionary events is 1) chromosome (chr) 7 gain and chr10 loss, followed by 2) CDKN2A loss and/or TP53 mutation, and 3) alterations canonical for specific subtypes. We then developed a computational methodology to identify drivers of broad copy number changes, identifying PDGFA (chr7) and PTEN (chr10) as driving initial nondisjunction events. These predictions were validated using mouse modeling, showing that PDGFA is sufficient to induce proneural-like gliomas and that additional NF1 loss converts proneural to the mesenchymal subtype. Our findings suggest that most non-GCIMP mesenchymal GBMs arise as, and evolve from, a proneural-like precursor.

Abstract: Summary
Ras-driven cancer cells upregulate basal autophagy that degrades and recycles intracellular proteins and organelles. Autophagy-mediated proteome degradation provides free amino acids to support metabolism and macromolecular synthesis, which confers a survival advantage in starvation and promotes tumorigenesis. While the degradation of isolated protein substrates by autophagy has been implicated in controlling cellular function, the extent and specificity by which autophagy remodels the cellular proteome and the underlying functional consequences were unknown. Here we compared the global proteome of autophagy-functional and -deficient Ras-driven cancer cells, finding that autophagy affects the majority of the proteome yet is highly selective. While levels of vesicle trafficking proteins important for autophagy are preserved during starvation-induced autophagy, deleterious inflammatory response pathway components are eliminated even under basal conditions, preventing cytokine-induced paracrine cell death. This reveals the global, functional impact of autophagy-mediated proteome remodeling on cell survival and identifies critical autophagy substrates that mediate this process.

Abstract: Summary
Intergenic transcription within repetitive loci such as the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats of yeast commonly triggers aberrant recombination. Major mechanisms suppressing aberrant rDNA recombination rely on chromatin silencing or RNAPII repression at intergenic spacers within the repeats. We find ancient processes operating at rDNA intergenic spacers and other loci to maintain genome stability via repression of RNA-DNA hybrids. The yeast Ataxin-2 protein Pbp1 binds noncoding RNA, suppresses RNA-DNA hybrids, and prevents aberrant rDNA recombination. Repression of RNA-DNA hybrids in Pbp1-deficient cells through RNaseH overexpression, deletion of the G4DNA-stabilizing Stm1, or caloric restriction operating via RNaseH/Pif1 restores rDNA stability. Pbp1 also limits hybrids at non-rDNA G4DNA loci including telomeres. Moreover, cells lacking Pbp1 have a short replicative lifespan that is extended upon hybrid suppression. Thus, we find roles for Pbp1 in genome maintenance and reveal that caloric restriction counteracts Pbp1 deficiencies by engaging RNaseH and Pif1.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosome-to-protamine exchange during mammalian spermiogenesis is essential for compaction and protection of paternal DNA. It is interesting that, depending on the species, 1% to 15% of nucleosomes are retained, but the generalizability and biological function of this retention are unknown. Here, we show concordantly in human and bovine that nucleosomes remained in sperm chromatin predominantly within distal intergenic regions and introns and associated with centromere repeats and retrotransposons (LINE1 and SINEs). In contrast, nucleosome depletion concerned particularly exons, 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR, TSS, and TTS and was associated with simple and low-complexity repeats. Overlap of human and bovine genes exhibiting nucleosome preservation in the promoter and gene body revealed a significant enrichment of signal transduction and RNA- and protein-processing factors. Our study demonstrates the genome-wide uniformity of the nucleosome preservation pattern in mammalian sperm and its connection to repetitive DNA elements and suggests a function in preimplantation processes for paternally derived nucleosomes.

Abstract: We used MCF-7 human breast cancer cells that endogenously express Cav3.1 and Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels toward a mechanistic study on the effect of EGCG on [Ca2+]i. Confocal Ca2+ imaging showed that EGCG induces a [Ca2+]i spike which is due to extracellular Ca2+ entry and is sensitive to catalase and to low-specificity (mibefradil) and high-specificity (Z944) T-type Ca2+channel blockers. siRNA knockdown of T-type Ca2+ channels indicated the involvement of Cav3.2 but not Cav3.1. Application of EGCG to HEK cells expressing either Cav3.2 or Cav3.1 induced enhancement of Cav3.2 and inhibition of Cav3.1 channel activity. Measurements of K+ currents in MCF-7 cells showed a reversible, catalase-sensitive inhibitory effect of EGCG, while siRNA for the Kv1.1 K+ channel induced a reduction of the EGCG [Ca2+]i spike. siRNA for Cav3.2 reduced EGCG cytotoxicity to MCF-7 cells, as measured by calcein viability assay. Together, data suggest that EGCG promotes the activation of Cav3.2 channels through K+ current inhibition leading to membrane depolarization, and in addition increases Cav3.2 currents. Cav3.2 channels are in part responsible for EGCG inhibition of MCF-7 viability, suggesting that deregulation of [Ca2+]i by EGCG may be relevant in breast cancer treatment.

Abstract: This study investigated the potential mechanisms that may underlie diabetes induced amyoatrophy. Sprague-Dawley rats were either injected intraperiotneally with STZ (test group; N=8) to induce diabetic-like symptoms (blood glucose level ≥16.65mmol/L) or with buffer (control group; N=8). Differences in muscle structure between the STZ-induced diabetic and control groups were evaluated by histochemistry. Protein and mRNA levels of basic FGF (bFGF), bax, bcl-2, and caspase 3 in skeletal muscle were compared between the 2 groups using immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR, respectively. Serum level of insulin and protein kinase C (PKC) were measured by competitive RIA and ELISA, respectively. Unlike control animals, the skeletal muscle fibers from STZ-induced diabetic animals were broken and pyknotic, the sarcomeric structure disrupted, and mild hyperplasia of interstitial adipose tissues was detected. The serum level of PKC was higher (P=0.003) and the protein and mRNA levels of bFGF in skeletal muscle were lower (P=0.001) in STZ-induced diabetic versus control animals. Protein and mRNA levels of the apoptosis promoting genes caspase-3 and bax were higher in skeletal muscle from STZ-induced diabetic rats as compared to control animals (P<0.001 and P=0.037, respectively), while mRNA and protein levels of bcl-2, an inhibitor of apoptosis, was lower in STZ-induced diabetic rats versus control animals (P=0.026). Increasing apoptosis in skeletal muscle from STZ-induced diabetic rats was further demonstrated by TNNEL assay. Our findings suggest that enhanced PKC levels, reduction of bFGF expression, and increased in apoptosis might be associated with the development of diabetes-induced myoatrophy.

Abstract: Summary
Diversification of cell size is hypothesized to have occurred through a process of evolutionary optimization, but direct demonstrations of causal relationships between cell geometry and fitness are lacking. Here, we identify a mutation from a laboratory-evolved bacterium that dramatically increases cell size through cytoskeletal perturbation and confers a large fitness advantage. We engineer a library of cytoskeletal mutants of different sizes and show that fitness scales linearly with respect to cell size over a wide physiological range. Quantification of the growth rates of single cells during the exit from stationary phase reveals that transitions between “feast-or-famine” growth regimes are a key determinant of cell-size-dependent fitness effects. We also uncover environments that suppress the fitness advantage of larger cells, indicating that cell-size-dependent fitness effects are subject to both biophysical and metabolic constraints. Together, our results highlight laboratory-based evolution as a powerful framework for studying the quantitative relationships between morphology and fitness.

Abstract: Inflammation and oxidation are two important factors in the pathogenesis of liver. Ephedra pachyclada (EP) is a traditional medical herb that has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. During this study, anti-oxidant activities of the EP extract was measured in vitro by 2,2′- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and β-Carotene bleaching assays. Then, we examined possible in vivo hepatoprotective effects of EP extract on mouse models of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced chronic and acute liver failure. To produce mouse models of chronic and acute liver injuries, male SW1 mice were interaperitoneally injected with 1ml/kg body weight (bw) CCl4 biweekly for 42 days and a single dose of 2ml/kg bw, respectively. In the experimental groups, mouse models were treated with low (140mg/kg bw) and high (1400mg/kg bw) doses of the EP extract. Olive oil and water treated mice were considered as controls during model derivation and EP extract treatment respectively. The results showed the antioxidant activity of EP extract and a significant reduction of all parameters of CCl4-induced liver injury such as relative liver weight, necrosis, fibrosis, inflammation, and serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in mouse models of acute and chronic liver injury treated with EP extract. Therefore, EP induces its hepatoprotective effects probably by suppressing oxidative stress and inhibit inflammation in the liver and is able to protect the liver against CCl4-induced acute and chronic injuries.

Abstract: Cell proliferation is tightly controlled by the cell-cycle regulatory proteins, primarily by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the G1 phase. The ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning (ARMS) scaffold protein, also known as kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa (Kidins 220), has been previously identified as a prominent downstream target of neurotrophin and ephrin receptors. Many studies have reported that ARMS/Kidins220 acts as a major signaling platform in organizing the signaling complex to regulate various cellular responses in the nervous and vascular systems. However, the role of ARMS/Kidins220 in cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression has never been investigated. Here we report that knockdown of ARMS/Kidins220 inhibits mouse neuroblastoma cell proliferation by inducing slowdown of cell cycle in the G1 phase. This effect is mediated by the upregulation of a CDK inhibitor p21, which causes the decrease in cyclin D1 and CDK4 protein levels and subsequent reduction of pRb hyperphosphorylation. Our results suggest a new role of ARMS/Kidins220 as a signaling platform to regulate tumor cell proliferation in response to the extracellular stimuli.

Abstract: Summary
L-carnitine, a nutrient in red meat, was recently reported to accelerate atherosclerosis via a metaorganismal pathway involving gut microbial trimethylamine (TMA) formation and host hepatic conversion into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Herein, we show that following L-carnitine ingestion, γ-butyrobetaine (γBB) is produced as an intermediary metabolite by gut microbes at a site anatomically proximal to and at a rate ∼1,000-fold higher than the formation of TMA. Moreover, we show that γBB is the major gut microbial metabolite formed from dietary L-carnitine in mice, is converted into TMA and TMAO in a gut microbiota-dependent manner (like dietary L-carnitine), and accelerates atherosclerosis. Gut microbial composition and functional metabolic studies reveal that distinct taxa are associated with the production of γBB or TMA/TMAO from dietary L-carnitine. Moreover, despite their close structural similarity, chronic dietary exposure to L-carnitine or γBB promotes development of functionally distinct microbial communities optimized for the metabolism of L-carnitine or γBB, respectively.

Abstract: Summary
Serotonergic neurons modulate behavioral and physiological responses from aggression and anxiety to breathing and thermoregulation. Disorders involving serotonin (5HT) dysregulation are commensurately heterogeneous and numerous. We hypothesized that this breadth in functionality derives in part from a developmentally determined substructure of distinct subtypes of 5HT neurons each specialized to modulate specific behaviors. By manipulating developmentally defined subgroups one by one chemogenetically, we find that the Egr2-Pet1 subgroup is specialized to drive increased ventilation in response to carbon dioxide elevation and acidosis. Furthermore, this subtype exhibits intrinsic chemosensitivity and modality-specific projections—increasing firing during hypercapnic acidosis and selectively projecting to respiratory chemosensory but not motor centers, respectively. These findings show that serotonergic regulation of the respiratory chemoreflex is mediated by a specialized molecular subtype of 5HT neuron harboring unique physiological, biophysical, and hodological properties specified developmentally and demonstrate that the serotonergic system contains specialized modules contributing to its collective functional breadth.

Obtaining complete protein inventories for subcellular regions is a challenge that often limits our understanding of cellular function, especially for regions that are impossible to purify and are therefore inaccessible to traditional proteomic analysis. We recently developed a method to map proteomes in living cells with an engineered peroxidase (APEX) that bypasses the need for organellar purification when applied to membrane-bound compartments; however, it was insufficiently specific when applied to unbounded regions that allow APEX-generated radicals to escape. Here, we combine APEX technology with a SILAC-based ratiometric tagging strategy to substantially reduce unwanted background and achieve nanometer spatial resolution. This is applied to map the proteome of the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), which can freely exchange small molecules with the cytosol. Our IMS proteome of 127 proteins has >94% specificity and includes nine newly discovered mitochondrial proteins. This approach will enable scientists to map proteomes of cellular regions that were previously inaccessible.

Abstract: Summary
The cJun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) stress signaling pathway is implicated in the metabolic response to the consumption of a high-fat diet, including the development of obesity and insulin resistance. These metabolic adaptations involve altered liver function. Here, we demonstrate that hepatic JNK potently represses the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). Therefore, JNK causes decreased expression of PPARα target genes that increase fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis and promote the development of insulin resistance. We show that the PPARα target gene fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) plays a key role in this response because disruption of the hepatic PPARα-FGF21 hormone axis suppresses the metabolic effects of JNK deficiency. This analysis identifies the hepatokine FGF21 as a critical mediator of JNK signaling in the liver.

Abstract: Summary
Extensive transcriptional networks play major roles in cellular and organismal functions. Transcript levels are in part determined by the combinatorial and overlapping functions of multiple transcription factors (TFs) bound to gene promoters. Thus, TF-promoter interactions provide the basic molecular wiring of transcriptional regulatory networks. In plants, discovery of the functional roles of TFs is limited by an increased complexity of network circuitry due to a significant expansion of TF families. Here, we present the construction of a comprehensive collection of Arabidopsis TFs clones created to provide a versatile resource for uncovering TF biological functions. We leveraged this collection by implementing a high-throughput DNA binding assay and identified direct regulators of a key clock gene (CCA1) that provide molecular links between different signaling modules and the circadian clock. The resources introduced in this work will significantly contribute to a better understanding of the transcriptional regulatory landscape of plant genomes.

A Distal Locus Element Mediates IFN-γ Priming of Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated TNF Gene Expression,

Abstract: Summary
Interferon γ (IFN-γ) priming sensitizes monocytes and macrophages to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, resulting in augmented expression of a set of genes including TNF. Here, we demonstrate that IFN-γ priming of LPS-stimulated TNF transcription requires a distal TNF/LT locus element 8 kb upstream of the TNF transcription start site (hHS-8). IFN-γ stimulation leads to increased DNase I accessibility of hHS-8 and its recruitment of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), and subsequent LPS stimulation enhances H3K27 acetylation and induces enhancer RNA synthesis at hHS-8. Ablation of IRF1 or targeting the hHS-8 IRF1 binding site in vivo with Cas9 linked to the KRAB repressive domain abolishes IFN-γ priming, but does not affect LPS induction of the gene. Thus, IFN-γ poises a distal enhancer in the TNF/LT locus by chromatin remodeling and IRF1 recruitment, which then drives enhanced TNF gene expression in response to a secondary toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulus.

Abstract: Summary
Poor understanding of the basic biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the etiological agent of tuberculosis, hampers development of much-needed drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic tests. Better experimental tools are needed to expedite investigations of this pathogen at the systems level. Here, we present a functional MTB proteome microarray covering most of the proteome and an ORFome library. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the microarray by investigating global protein-protein interactions, small-molecule-protein binding, and serum biomarker discovery, identifying 59 PknG-interacting proteins, 30 bis-(3′-5′)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) binding proteins, and 14 MTB proteins that together differentiate between tuberculosis (TB) patients with active disease and recovered individuals. Results suggest that the MTB rhamnose pathway is likely regulated by both the serine/threonine kinase PknG and c-di-GMP. This resource has the potential to generate a greater understanding of key biological processes in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, possibly leading to more effective therapies for the treatment of this ancient disease.

Abstract: Summary
The estrogen receptor α (ERα) controls cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by recruiting various cofactors to estrogen response elements (EREs) to control gene transcription. A deeper understanding of these transcriptional mechanisms may uncover therapeutic targets for ERα-dependent cancers. We show that BRD4 regulates ERα-induced gene expression by affecting elongation-associated phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and histone H2B monoubiquitination. Consistently, BRD4 activity is required for proliferation of ER+ breast and endometrial cancer cells and uterine growth in mice. Genome-wide studies revealed an enrichment of BRD4 on transcriptional start sites of active genes and a requirement of BRD4 for H2B monoubiquitination in the transcribed region of estrogen-responsive genes. Importantly, we demonstrate that BRD4 occupancy on distal EREs enriched for H3K27ac is required for recruitment and elongation of RNAPII on EREs and the production of ERα-dependent enhancer RNAs. These results uncover BRD4 as a central regulator of ERα function and potential therapeutic target.

Abstract: Summary
The formation of epithelial tissues containing lumens requires not only the apical-basolateral polarization of cells, but also the coordinated orientation of this polarity such that the apical surfaces of neighboring cells all point toward the central lumen. Defects in extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling lead to inverted polarity so that the apical surfaces face the surrounding ECM. We report a molecular switch mechanism controlling polarity orientation. ECM signals through a β1-integrin/FAK/p190RhoGAP complex to downregulate a RhoA/ROCK/Ezrin pathway at the ECM interface. PKCβII phosphorylates the apical identity-promoting Podocalyxin/NHERF1/Ezrin complex, removing Podocalyxin from the ECM-abutting cell surface and initiating its transcytosis to an apical membrane initiation site for lumen formation. Inhibition of this switch mechanism results in the retention of Podocalyxin at the ECM interface and the development instead of collective front-rear polarization and motility. Thus, ECM-derived signals control the morphogenesis of epithelial tissues by controlling the collective orientation of epithelial polarization.

Abstract: Summary
Little is known about the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) distinguishing extraembryonic endoderm (ExEn) stem (XEN) cells from those that maintain the extensively characterized embryonic stem cell (ESC). An intriguing network candidate is Sox17, an essential transcription factor for XEN derivation and self-renewal. Here, we show that forced Sox17 expression drives ESCs toward ExEn, generating XEN cells that contribute to ExEn when placed back into early mouse embryos. Transient Sox17 expression is sufficient to drive this fate change during which time cells transit through distinct intermediate states prior to the generation of functional XEN-like cells. To orchestrate this conversion process, Sox17 acts in autoregulatory and feedforward network motifs, regulating dynamic GRNs directing cell fate. Sox17-mediated XEN conversion helps to explain the regulation of cell-fate changes and reveals GRNs regulating lineage decisions in the mouse embryo.

Abstract: Desmin, being a major intermediate filament of mature muscle cell, interacts with mitochondria within the cell and participates in mitochondria proper localization. The goal of the present study was to assess the effect of aggregate-prone and non-aggregate-prone desmin mutations on mitochondrial calcium uptake. Primary murine satellite cells were transduced with lentiviruses carrying desmin in wild type or mutant form, and were induced to differentiate into myotubes. Four mutations resulting in different degree of desmin aggregates formation were analyzed. Tail domain mutation Asp399Tyr has the mildest impact on desmin filament polymerization, rod domain mutation Ala357Pro causes formation of large aggregates composed of filamentous material, and Leu345Pro and Leu370Pro are considered to be the most severest in their impact on desmin polymerization and structure. For mitochondrial calcium measurement cells were loaded with rhod 2-AM. We found that aggregate-prone mutations significantly decreased [Ca2+]mit, whereas non-aggregate-prone mutations did not decrease [Ca2+]mit. Moreover aggregate-prone desmin mutations resulted in increased resting cytosolic [Ca2+]. However this increase was not accompanied by any alterations in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release. We suggest that the observed decline in [Ca2+]mit was due to desmin aggregate accumulation resulting in the loss of desmin mitochondria interactions.

The Intraflagellar Transport Protein IFT27 Promotes BBSome Exit from Cilia through the GTPase ARL6/BBS3,

Abstract: Summary
The sorting of signaling receptors into and out of cilia relies on the BBSome, a complex of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins, and on the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. GTP loading onto the Arf-like GTPase ARL6/BBS3 drives assembly of a membrane-apposed BBSome coat that promotes cargo entry into cilia, yet how and where ARL6 is activated remains elusive. Here, we show that the Rab-like GTPase IFT27/RABL4, a known component of IFT complex B, promotes the exit of BBSome and associated cargoes from cilia. Unbiased proteomics and biochemical reconstitution assays show that, upon disengagement from the rest of IFT-B, IFT27 directly interacts with the nucleotide-free form of ARL6. Furthermore, IFT27 prevents aggregation of nucleotide-free ARL6 in solution. Thus, we propose that IFT27 separates from IFT-B inside cilia to promote ARL6 activation, BBSome coat assembly, and subsequent ciliary exit, mirroring the process by which BBSome mediates cargo entry into cilia.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells are good candidates for the clinical application of bone repair because of their osteogenic differentiation potential, but in vivo osteoinduction potential should be verified for culture expanded cells before clinical application. This study analyzed in vivo bone formation by MSCs quantitatively after implantation of MSCs planted porous biphasic ceramic cubes into athymic mice. MSCs were divided into osteogenic differentiation-induced and normal groups and also tested in vitro to evaluate the degree of differentiation into osteoblasts. The osteogenic induced group showed higher alkaline phosphatase and calcium level in vitro and corresponding higher level of bone formation in vivo compared to control group. Whereas there was no bone formation observed in fibroblast-implanted negative control group. In critical sized bone defect models, commonly used for evaluation of bone regeneration ability, it is difficult to distinguish between osteoinduction and osteoconduction, and quantitative analysis is not simple. However, this method for evaluating osteoinduction is both accurate and simple. In conclusion, the analysis of in vivo bone formation using porous ceramic cubes is a powerful and simple method for evaluating the osteoinduction ability of target cells and, furthermore, can be applied for evaluation of scaffolds for their osteoinductive properties.

Abstract: Summary
How cells maintain specific levels of each protein and whether that control is evolutionarily conserved are key questions. Here, we report proteome-wide steady-state protein turnover rate measurements for the evolutionarily distant but ecologically similar yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We find that the half-life of most proteins is much longer than currently thought and determined to a large degree by protein synthesis and dilution due to cell division. However, we detect a significant subset of proteins (∼15%) in both yeasts that are turned over rapidly. In addition, the relative abundances of orthologous proteins between the two yeasts are highly conserved across the 400 million years of evolution. In contrast, their respective turnover rates differ considerably. Our data provide a high-confidence resource for studying protein degradation in common yeast model systems.

Abstract: Summary
The use of oligonucleotides to activate the splicing of selected exons is limited by a poor understanding of the mechanisms affected. A targeted bifunctional oligonucleotide enhancer of splicing (TOES) anneals to SMN2 exon 7 and carries an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) sequence. We show that it stimulates splicing specifically of intron 6 in the presence of repressing sequences in intron 7. Complementarity to the 5′ end of exon 7 increases U2AF65 binding, but the ESE sequence is required for efficient recruitment of U2 snRNP. The ESE forms at least three coexisting discrete states: a quadruplex, a complex containing only hnRNP F/H, and a complex enriched in the activator SRSF1. Neither hnRNP H nor quadruplex formation contributes to ESE activity. The results suggest that splicing limited by weak signals can be rescued by rapid exchange of TOES oligonucleotides in various complexes and raise the possibility that SR proteins associate transiently with ESEs.

A Switch from White to Brown Fat Increases Energy Expenditure in Cancer-Associated Cachexia,

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a wasting syndrome characterized by systemic inflammation, body weight loss, atrophy of white adipose tissue (WAT) and skeletal muscle. Limited therapeutic options are available and the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. Here we show that a phenotypic switch from WAT to brown fat, a phenomenon termed WAT browning, takes place in the initial stages of CAC, before skeletal muscle atrophy. WAT browning is associated with increased expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which uncouples mitochondrial respiration toward thermogenesis instead of ATP synthesis, leading to increased lipid mobilization and energy expenditure in cachectic mice. Chronic inflammation and the cytokine interleukin-6 increase UCP1 expression in WAT, and treatments that reduce inflammation or β-adrenergic blockade reduce WAT browning and ameliorate the severity of cachexia. Importantly, UCP1 staining is observed in WAT from CAC patients. Thus, inhibition of WAT browning represents a promising approach to ameliorate cachexia in cancer patients.

Abstract: Summary
The accumulation of mutations in RNA viruses is thought to facilitate rapid adaptation to changes in the environment. However, most mutations have deleterious effects on fitness, especially for viruses. Thus, tolerance to mutations should determine the nature and extent of genetic diversity that can be maintained in the population. Here, we combine population genetics theory, computer simulation, and experimental evolution to examine the advantages and disadvantages of tolerance to mutations, also known as mutational robustness. We find that mutational robustness increases neutral diversity and, as expected, can facilitate adaptation to a new environment. Surprisingly, under certain conditions, robustness may also be an impediment for viral adaptation, if a highly diverse population contains a large proportion of previously neutral mutations that are deleterious in the new environment. These findings may inform therapeutic strategies that cause extinction of otherwise robust viral populations.

Abstract: Summary
An adaptive immune response triggered by obesity is characterized by the activation of adipose tissue CD4+ T cells by unclear mechanisms. We have examined whether interactions between adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) and CD4+ T cells contribute to adipose tissue metainflammation. Intravital microscopy identifies dynamic antigen-dependent interactions between ATMs and T cells in visceral fat. Mice deficient in major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) showed protection from diet-induced obesity. Deletion of MHC II expression in macrophages led to an adipose tissue-specific decrease in the effector/memory CD4+ T cells, attenuation of CD11c+ ATM accumulation, and improvement in glucose intolerance by increasing adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. Ablation experiments demonstrated that the maintenance of proliferating conventional T cells is dependent on signals from CD11c+ ATMs in obese mice. These studies demonstrate the importance of MHCII-restricted signals from ATMs that regulate adipose tissue T cell maturation and metainflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Prosenescence therapy has recently emerged as a novel therapeutic approach for treating cancer. However, this concept is challenged by conflicting evidence showing that the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of senescent tumor cells can have pro- as well as antitumorigenic effects. Herein, we report that, in Pten-null senescent tumors, activation of the Jak2/Stat3 pathway establishes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that contributes to tumor growth and chemoresistance. Activation of the Jak2/Stat3 pathway in Pten-null tumors is sustained by the downregulation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11/SHP2, providing evidence for the existence of a novel PTEN/SHP2 axis. Importantly, treatment with docetaxel in combination with a JAK2 inhibitor reprograms the SASP and improves the efficacy of docetaxel-induced senescence by triggering a strong antitumor immune response in Pten-null tumors. Altogether, these data demonstrate that immune surveillance of senescent tumor cells can be suppressed in specific genetic backgrounds but also evoked by pharmacological treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian circadian rhythms are generated by a negative feedback loop in which PERIOD (PER) proteins accumulate, form a large nuclear complex (PER complex), and bind the transcription factor CLOCK-BMAL1, repressing their own expression. We found that mouse PER complexes include the Mi-2/nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase (NuRD) transcriptional corepressor. Unexpectedly, two NuRD subunits, CHD4 and MTA2, constitutively associate with CLOCK-BMAL1, with CHD4 functioning to promote CLOCK-BMAL1 transcriptional activity. At the onset of negative feedback, the PER complex delivers the remaining complementary NuRD subunits to DNA-bound CLOCK-BMAL1, thereby reconstituting a NuRD corepressor that is important for circadian transcriptional feedback and clock function. The PER complex thus acquires full repressor activity only upon successful targeting of CLOCK-BMAL1. Our results show how specificity is generated in the clock despite its dependence on generic transcriptional regulators and reveal the existence of active communication between the positive and negative limbs of the circadian feedback loop.

Abstract: One of the approaches for treating demyelination diseases is cytotherapy, and adult stem cells are potential sources. In this investigation, we tried to increase the yield of oligodendrocyte-like cells (OLCs) by inducing neural stem cells generated from BMSCs-derived neurospheres, which were used for deriving the neural stem cells (NSCs). The latter were induced into OLCs by heregulin, PDGF-AA, bFGF and triiodothyronine (T3). The BMSCs, NS, NSCs and OLCs were characterized by using immunocytochemistry for fibronectin, CD44, CD90, CD45, Oct-4, O4, Olig2, O1 and MBP markers. PDGF receptor α (PDGFR-α), Olig2 and MOG expression were evaluated by RT-PCR. The BMSCs expressed CD44, CD90, CD106 and Oct-4; the NSCs were immunoreactive to nestin and neurofilament 68. Incubation of the NSCs for 4 days with heregulin, PDGF-AA and bFGF resulted in their induction into oligodendrocyte progenitor-like cells (OPLCs), which immunoreacted to O4, Olig2 and O1, while Olig2 and PDGFR-α were detected by RT-PCR. Replacing heregulin, PDGF-AA and bFGF with T3 for 6 days resulted in repression of O4, O1, Olig2 and PDGFR-α. The OLCs were co-cultured with motoneurons resulted in induction of MOG and MBP, which were expressed in functional OLCs. The latter can be generated from BMSCs-derive NS with high yield.

Abstract: Summary
Mammalian embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and sperm exhibit unusual chromatin packaging that plays important roles in cellular function. Here, we extend a recently developed technique, based on deep paired-end sequencing of lightly digested chromatin, to assess footprints of nucleosomes and other DNA-binding proteins genome-wide in murine ESCs and sperm. In ESCs, we recover well-characterized features of chromatin such as promoter nucleosome depletion and further identify widespread footprints of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins such as CTCF, which we validate in knockdown studies. We document global differences in nuclease accessibility between ESCs and sperm, finding that the majority of histone retention in sperm preferentially occurs in large gene-poor genomic regions, with only a small subset of nucleosomes being retained over promoters of developmental regulators. Finally, we describe evidence that CTCF remains associated with the genome in mature sperm, where it could play a role in organizing the sperm genome.

Abstract: The balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and destruction of mineralized bone matrix by osteoclasts is important for bone homeostasis. The increase of osteoclast differentiation by RANKL induces bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Recent studies have shown that insulin is one of main factors mediating the cross-talk between bone remodeling and energy metabolism. However, the systemic examination of insulin-induced differential gene expression profiles in osteoclasts has not been extensively studied. Here, we investigated the global effects of insulin on osteoclast precursors at the level of gene transcription by microarray analysis. The number of genes that were up-regulated by ≥ 1.5 fold after insulin treatment for 6 h, 12 h, or 24 h was 76, 73, and 39; and 96, 83, and 54 genes were down-regulated, respectively. The genes were classified by 20 biological processes or 24 molecular functions and the number of genes involved in ‘development processes’ and ‘cell proliferation and differentiation’ was 25 and 18, respectively, including Inhba, Socs, Plk3, Tnfsf4, and Plk1. The microarray results of these genes were verified by real-time RT-PCR analysis. We also compared the effects of insulin and RANKL on the expression of these genes. Most genes had a very similar pattern of expressions in insulin- and RANKL-treated cells. Interestingly, Tnfsf4 and Inhba genes were affected by insulin but not by RANKL. Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for insulin in osteoclast biology, thus contributing to the understanding of the pathogenesis and development of therapeutics for numerous bone and metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Myelin formation during peripheral nervous system (PNS) development, and reformation after injury and in disease, requires multiple intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Akt/mTOR signaling has emerged as a major player involved, but the molecular mechanisms and downstream effectors are virtually unknown. Here, we have used Schwann-cell-specific conditional gene ablation of raptor and rictor, which encode essential components of the mTOR complexes 1 (mTORC1) and 2 (mTORC2), respectively, to demonstrate that mTORC1 controls PNS myelination during development. In this process, mTORC1 regulates lipid biosynthesis via sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). This course of action is mediated by the nuclear receptor RXRγ, which transcriptionally regulates SREBP1c downstream of mTORC1. Absence of mTORC1 causes delayed myelination initiation as well as hypomyelination, together with abnormal lipid composition and decreased nerve conduction velocity. Thus, we have identified the mTORC1-RXRγ-SREBP axis controlling lipid biosynthesis as a major contributor to proper peripheral nerve function.

Abstract: Summary
Sox4 expression is restricted in mammals to embryonic structures and some adult tissues, such as lymphoid organs, pancreas, intestine, and skin. During embryogenesis, Sox4 regulates mesenchymal and neural progenitor survival, as well as lymphocyte and myeloid differentiation, and contributes to pancreas, bone, and heart development. Aberrant Sox4 expression is linked to malignant transformation and metastasis in several types of cancer. To understand the role of Sox4 in the adult organism, we first generated mice with reduced whole-body Sox4 expression. These mice display accelerated aging and reduced cancer incidence. To specifically address a role for Sox4 in adult stem cells, we conditionally deleted Sox4 (Sox4cKO) in stratified epithelia. Sox4cKO mice show increased skin stem cell quiescence and resistance to chemical carcinogenesis concomitantly with downregulation of cell cycle, DNA repair, and activated hair follicle stem cell pathways. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of Sox4 in regulating adult tissue homeostasis and cancer.

Abstract: Summary
During hematopoiesis, cells originating from the same stem cell reservoir differentiate into distinct cell types. The mechanisms enabling common progenitors to differentiate into alternative cell fates are not fully understood. Here, we identify cell-fate-determining transcription factors (TFs) governing dendritic cell (DC) development by annotating the enhancer landscapes of the DC lineage. Combining these analyses with detailed overexpression, knockdown, and ChIP-Seq studies, we show that Irf8 functions as a plasmacytoid DC epigenetic and fate-determining TF, regulating massive, cell-specific chromatin changes in thousands of pDC enhancers. Importantly, Irf8 forms a negative feedback loop with Cebpb, a monocyte-derived DC epigenetic fate-determining TF. We show that using this circuit logic, a pulse of TF expression can stably define epigenetic and transcriptional states, regardless of the microenvironment. More broadly, our study proposes a general paradigm that allows closely related cells with a similar set of signal-dependent factors to generate differential and persistent enhancer landscapes.

Abstract: Summary
BET family proteins are novel therapeutic targets for cancer and inflammation and represent the first chromatin readers against which small-molecule inhibitors have been developed. First-generation BET inhibitors have shown therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models, but the consequences of sustained BET protein inhibition in normal tissues remain poorly characterized. Using an inducible and reversible transgenic RNAi mouse model, we show that strong suppression of the BET protein Brd4 in adult animals has dramatic effects in multiple tissues. Brd4-depleted mice display reversible epidermal hyperplasia, alopecia, and decreased cellular diversity and stem cell depletion in the small intestine. Furthermore, Brd4-suppressed intestines are sensitive to organ stress and show impaired regeneration following irradiation, suggesting that concurrent Brd4 suppression and certain cytotoxic therapies may induce undesirable synergistic effects. These findings provide important insight into Brd4 function in normal tissues and, importantly, predict several potential outcomes associated with potent and sustained BET protein inhibition.

Abstract: Summary
γ-Secretase is composed of four proteins that are obligatory for protease activity: presenilin, nicastrin, Aph1, and Pen-2. Despite the progress toward understanding the function of these individual subunits, there is no information available pertaining to the modulation of γ-secretase in response to environmental changes in cells. Here, we show that hypoxia upregulates γ-secretase activity through a direct interaction with Hif-1α, revealing an unconventional function for Hif-1α as an enzyme subunit, which is distinct from its canonical role as a transcription factor. Moreover, hypoxia-induced cell invasion and metastasis are alleviated by either γ-secretase inhibitors or a dominant-negative Notch coactivator, indicating that γ-secretase/Notch signaling plays an essential role in controlling these cellular processes. The present study reveals a mechanism in which γ-secretase can achieve temporal control through conditional interactions with regulatory proteins, such as Hif-1α, under select physiological and pathological conditions.

RIP3 Induces Apoptosis Independent of Pronecrotic Kinase Activity,

Abstract: Summary
Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3 or RIPK3) has emerged as a central player in necroptosis and a potential target to control inflammatory disease. Here, three selective small-molecule compounds are shown to inhibit RIP3 kinase-dependent necroptosis, although their therapeutic value is undermined by a surprising, concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis. These compounds interact with RIP3 to activate caspase 8 (Casp8) via RHIM-driven recruitment of RIP1 (RIPK1) to assemble a Casp8-FADD-cFLIP complex completely independent of pronecrotic kinase activities and MLKL. RIP3 kinase-dead D161N mutant induces spontaneous apoptosis independent of compound, whereas D161G, D143N, and K51A mutants, like wild-type, only trigger apoptosis when compound is present. Accordingly, RIP3-K51A mutant mice (Rip3K51A/K51A) are viable and fertile, in stark contrast to the perinatal lethality of Rip3D161N/D161N mice. RIP3 therefore holds both necroptosis and apoptosis in balance through a Ripoptosome-like platform. This work highlights a common mechanism unveiling RHIM-driven apoptosis by therapeutic or genetic perturbation of RIP3.

Abstract: Summary
The appropriate trafficking of glutamate receptors to synapses is crucial for basic synaptic function and synaptic plasticity. It is now accepted that NMDA receptors (NMDARs) internalize and are recycled at the plasma membrane but also exchange between synaptic and extrasynaptic pools; these NMDAR properties are also key to governing synaptic plasticity. Scribble1 is a large PDZ protein required for synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Herein, we show that the level of Scribble1 is regulated in an activity-dependent manner and that Scribble1 controls the number of NMDARs at the plasma membrane. Notably, Scribble1 prevents GluN2A subunits from undergoing lysosomal trafficking and degradation by increasing their recycling to the plasma membrane following NMDAR activation. Finally, we show that a specific YxxR motif on Scribble1 controls these mechanisms through a direct interaction with AP2. Altogether, our findings define a molecular mechanism to control the levels of synaptic NMDARs via Scribble1 complex signaling.

Abstract: Summary
Translational control of mRNAs allows for rapid and selective changes in synaptic protein expression that are required for long-lasting plasticity and memory formation in the brain. Fragile X Related Protein 1 (FXR1P) is an RNA-binding protein that controls mRNA translation in nonneuronal cells and colocalizes with translational machinery in neurons. However, its neuronal mRNA targets and role in the brain are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that removal of FXR1P from the forebrain of postnatal mice selectively enhances long-term storage of spatial memories, hippocampal late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP), and de novo GluA2 synthesis. Furthermore, FXR1P binds specifically to the 5′ UTR of GluA2 mRNA to repress translation and limit the amount of GluA2 that is incorporated at potentiated synapses. This study uncovers a mechanism for regulating long-lasting synaptic plasticity and spatial memory formation and reveals an unexpected divergent role of FXR1P among Fragile X proteins in brain plasticity.
