Abstract: Summary
Regulation of cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) affects gene expression and polyadenylation site (PAS) choice. Here, we report that the CPA and termination factor PCF11 modulates gene expression on the basis of gene size. Although downregulation of PCF11 leads to inhibition of short gene expression, long genes are upregulated because of suppressed intronic polyadenylation (IPA) enriched in large introns. We show that this regulatory scheme, named PCF11-mediated expression regulation through IPA (PEIPA), takes place in cell differentiation, during which downregulation of PCF11 is coupled with upregulation of long genes with functions in cell morphology, adhesion, and migration. PEIPA targets distinct gene sets in different cell contexts with similar rules. Furthermore, PCF11 is autoregulated through a conserved IPA site, the removal of which leads to global activation of PASs close to gene promotors. Therefore, PCF11 uses distinct mechanisms to regulate genes of different sizes, and its autoregulation maintains homeostasis of PAS usage in the cell.

Abstract: The aim was to investigate the effect of injecting adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) on reducing oxidative stress, inflammation and improving the structure and function of the autografted ovaries through stereological and biochemical evaluations. Mice (4–5 weeks old) were divided into three groups: control, autograft, and autograft + ADSCs (six mice per group). 7 days after ovary autografting and ADSCs injection, serum concentrations of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase activity were measured. On day 28, ovary histology and CD31 expression was assessed. Serum concentrations of progesterone and estradiol were also estimated. in the autograft + ADSCs group, the total volume of the ovary and the volume of the cortex, the number of follicles, the serum concentrations of IL10, estradiol and SOD activity significantly increased compared to the autograft group(P ≤ 0.05). Serum concentrations of IL6, TNFα and MDA in the autograft + ADSCs group were significantly lower than the autograft group (P ≤ 0.05). The localization of CD31-positive cells in the theca layer of follicles improved to the control level following ADSCs transplantation. The ability of ADSCs to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation probably plays a considerable role in improving the structure and function of the autografted ovaries.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrient restriction (NR) decreases the incidence and growth of many types of tumors, yet the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we identified Headcase (Hdc) and Unkempt (Unk) as two NR-specific tumor suppressor proteins that form a complex to restrict cell cycle progression and tissue growth in response to NR in Drosophila. Loss of Hdc or Unk does not confer apparent growth advantage under normal nutrient conditions but leads to accelerated cell cycle progression and tissue overgrowth under NR. Hdc and Unk bind to the TORC1 component Raptor and preferentially regulate S6 phosphorylation in a TORC1-dependent manner. We further show that HECA and UNK, the human counterparts of Drosophila Hdc and Unk, respectively, have a conserved function in regulating S6 phosphorylation and tissue growth. The identification of Hdc and Unk as two NR-specific tumor suppressors provides insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-tumorigenic effects of NR.

Abstract: Summary
The 26S proteasome is the ATP-dependent protease responsible for regulating the proteome of eukaryotic cells through degradation of mainly ubiquitin-tagged substrates. In order to understand how proteasome responds to ubiquitin signal, we resolved an ensemble of cryo-EM structures of proteasome in the presence of K48-Ub4, with three of them resolved at near-atomic resolution. We identified a conformation with stabilized ubiquitin receptors and a previously unreported orientation of the lid, assigned as a Ub-accepted state C1-b. We determined another structure C3-b with localized K48-Ub4 to the toroid region of Rpn1, assigned as a substrate-processing state. Our structures indicate that tetraUb induced conformational changes in proteasome could initiate substrate degradation. We also propose a CP gate-opening mechanism involving the propagation of the motion of the lid to the gate through the Rpn6-α2 interaction. Our results enabled us to put forward a model of a functional cycle for proteasomes induced by tetraUb and nucleotide.

Abstract: Summary
DNA shape adds specificity to sequence motifs but has not been explored systematically outside this context. We hypothesized that DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) preferentially occupy DNA with specific structures (“shape motifs”) regardless of whether or not these correspond to high information content sequence motifs. We present ShapeMF, a Gibbs sampling algorithm that identifies de novo shape motifs. Using binding data from hundreds of in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that most DBPs have shape motifs and can occupy these in the absence of sequence motifs. This “shape-only binding” is common for many DBPs and in regions co-bound by multiple DBPs. When shape and sequence motifs co-occur, they can be overlapping, flanking, or separated by consistent spacing. Finally, DBPs within the same protein family have different shape motifs, explaining their distinct genome-wide occupancy despite having similar sequence motifs. These results suggest that shape motifs not only complement sequence motifs but also facilitate recognition of DNA beyond conventionally defined sequence motifs.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEV) “educate” healthy cells to promote metastases. We found that melanoma TEV downregulated type I interferon (IFN) receptor and expression of IFN-inducible cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). CH25H produces 25-hydroxycholesterol, which inhibited TEV uptake. Low CH25H levels in leukocytes from melanoma patients correlated with poor prognosis. Mice incapable of downregulating the IFN receptor and Ch25h were resistant to TEV uptake, TEV-induced pre-metastatic niche, and melanoma lung metastases; however, ablation of Ch25h reversed these phenotypes. An anti-hypertensive drug, reserpine, suppressed TEV uptake and disrupted TEV-induced formation of the pre-metastatic niche and melanoma lung metastases. These results suggest the importance of CH25H in defense against education of normal cells by TEV and argue for the use of reserpine in adjuvant melanoma therapy.

Abstract: Summary
During gene expression, RNA export factors are mainly known for driving nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. While early studies suggested that the exon junction complex (EJC) provides a binding platform for them, subsequent work proposed that they are only recruited by the cap binding complex to the 5′ end of RNAs, as part of TREX. Using iCLIP, we show that the export receptor Nxf1 and two TREX subunits, Alyref and Chtop, are recruited to the whole mRNA co-transcriptionally via splicing but before 3′ end processing. Consequently, Alyref alters splicing decisions and Chtop regulates alternative polyadenylation. Alyref is recruited to the 5′ end of RNAs by CBC, and our data reveal subsequent binding to RNAs near EJCs. We demonstrate that eIF4A3 stimulates Alyref deposition not only on spliced RNAs close to EJC sites but also on single-exon transcripts. Our study reveals mechanistic insights into the co-transcriptional recruitment of mRNA export factors and how this shapes the human transcriptome.

Abstract: Biliary atresia (BA) is a lethal disease of infancy with obscure etiology. Insight into the pathogenesis of this disorder is limited by lack of availability of adequate epithelial tissue. Primary culture of human biliary epithelium may help to provide material for diagnostic and research purposes. However, culture of these cells from atretic tissue is a challenging task. We aimed to develop a reliable and easier protocol for culture of human biliary epithelial cells from excised atretic extrahepatic bile duct. An explant culture was performed using tissue obtained from 30 children with diseases of biliary tract. The culture showed florid cell growth in less than 3 weeks. Epithelial nature and biliary origin of cultured cells was confirmed using pancytokeratin and cytokeratin -7 antibodies. The protocol showed 100% success rate as cells could be cultured in all 30 patients. Moreover, the cells remained viable for a duration of over 3 months in most of the cases. This easier culture technique is likely to have an impact on the study of biliary cell pathophysiology, particularly in BA.

Abstract: Summary
Cell-based studies of human ribonucleases traditionally rely on methods that deplete proteins slowly. We engineered cells in which the 3′→5′ exoribonucleases of the exosome complex, DIS3 and EXOSC10, can be rapidly eliminated to assess their immediate roles in nuclear RNA biology. The loss of DIS3 has the greatest impact, causing the substantial accumulation of thousands of transcripts within 60 min. These transcripts include enhancer RNAs, promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), and products of premature cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA). These transcripts are unaffected by the rapid loss of EXOSC10, suggesting that they are rarely targeted to it. More direct detection of EXOSC10-bound transcripts revealed its substrates to prominently include short 3′ extended ribosomal and small nucleolar RNAs. Finally, the 5′→3′ exoribonuclease, XRN2, has little activity on exosome substrates, but its elimination uncovers different mechanisms for the early termination of transcription from protein-coding gene promoters.

Abstract: Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein (HINT) is a member of the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily, which has hydrolase activity owing to a histidine triad motif. The HIT superfamily can be divided to five classes with functions in galactose metabolism, DNA repair, and tumor suppression. HINTs are highly conserved from archaea to humans and function as tumor suppressors, translation regulators, and neuropathy inhibitors. Although the structures of HINT proteins from various species have been reported, limited structural information is available for fungal species. Here, to elucidate the structural features and functional diversity of HINTs, we determined the crystal structure of HINT from the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans (CaHINT) in complex with zinc ions at a resolution of 2.5 Å. Based on structural comparisons, the monomer of CaHINT overlaid best with HINT protein from the protozoal species Leishmania major. Additionally, structural comparisons with human HINT revealed an additional helix at the C-terminus of CaHINT. Interestingly, the extended C-terminal helix interacted with the N-terminal loop (α1–β1) and with the α3 helix, which appeared to stabilize the dimerization of CaHINT. In the C-terminal region, structural and sequence comparisons showed strong relationships among 19 diverse species from archea to humans, suggesting early separation in the course of evolution. Further studies are required to address the functional significance of variations in the C-terminal region. This structural analysis of CaHINT provided important insights into the molecular aspects of evolution within the HIT superfamily.

Abstract: Summary
Mutations that lead to splicing defects can have severe consequences on gene function and cause disease. Here, we explore how human genetic variation affects exon recognition by developing a multiplexed functional assay of splicing using Sort-seq (MFASS). We assayed 27,733 variants in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) within or adjacent to 2,198 human exons in the MFASS minigene reporter and found that 3.8% (1,050) of variants, most of which are extremely rare, led to large-effect splice-disrupting variants (SDVs). Importantly, we find that 83% of SDVs are located outside of canonical splice sites, are distributed evenly across distinct exonic and intronic regions, and are difficult to predict a priori. Our results indicate extant, rare genetic variants can have large functional effects on splicing at appreciable rates, even outside the context of disease, and MFASS enables their empirical assessment at scale.

Abstract: Summary
Enhancers are ubiquitous and critical gene-regulatory elements. However, quantitative understanding of the role of DNA looping in the regulation of enhancer action and specificity is limited. We used the Escherichia coli NtrC enhancer-σ54 promoter system as an in vivo model, finding that NtrC activation is highly sensitive to the enhancer-promoter (E-P) distance in the 300–6,000 bp range. DNA loops formed by Lac repressor were able to strongly regulate enhancer action either positively or negatively, recapitulating promoter targeting and insulation. A single LacI loop combining targeting and insulation produced a strong shift in specificity for enhancer choice between two σ54 promoters. A combined kinetic-thermodynamic model was used to quantify the effect of DNA-looping interactions on promoter activity and revealed that sensitivity to E-P distance and to control by other loops is itself dependent on enhancer and promoter parameters that may be subject to regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Body and organ size regulation in mammals involves multiple signaling pathways and remains largely enigmatic. Here, we report that Pum1 and Pum2, which encode highly conserved PUF RNA-binding proteins, regulate mouse body and organ size by post-transcriptional repression of the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1b. Binding of PUM1 or PUM2 to Pumilio binding elements (PBEs) in the 3′ UTR of Cdkn1b inhibits translation, promoting G1-S transition and cell proliferation. Mice with null mutations in Pum1 and Pum2 exhibit gene dosage-dependent reductions in body and organ size, and deficiency for Cdkn1b partially rescues postnatal growth defects in Pum1−/− mice. We propose that coordinated tissue-specific expression of Pum1 and Pum2, which involves auto-regulatory and reciprocal post-transcriptional repression, contributes to the precise regulation of body and organ size. Hence PUM-mediated post-transcriptional control of cell cycle regulators represents an additional layer of control in the genetic regulation of organ and body size.

Abstract: Summary
The heart is the central organ of the circulatory system, and its proper development is vital for maintaining human life. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the gene expression landscapes of ∼4,000 cardiac cells from human embryos and identified four major types of cells: cardiomyocytes (CMs), cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells (ECs), and valvar interstitial cells (VICs). Atrial and ventricular CMs acquired distinct features early in heart development. Furthermore, both CMs and fibroblasts show stepwise changes in gene expression. As development proceeds, VICs may be involved in the remodeling phase, and ECs display location-specific characteristics. Finally, we compared gene expression profiles between humans and mice and identified a series of unique features of human heart development. Our study lays the groundwork for elucidating the mechanisms of in vivo human cardiac development and provides potential clues to understand cardiac regeneration.

Abstract: A comparative study of His-tagged and non-tagged rat β-parvalbumin (rWT β-PA), calcium binding protein with the EF-hand calcium binding domains, has been carried out. The attachment of His-tag increases α-helical content and decreases β-sheets and β-turns content of the metal free form (apo-state) of β-PA. In contrast to this, the attachment of His-tag decreases α-helical content by more than 10% and increases contents of β-sheets and β-turns of the Ca2+-loaded state. According to the dynamic light scattering analysis, apo-state of His-tagged rat β-PA seems to be less compact compared with the apo-state of non-tagged rat β-PA. Surprisingly, the attachment of His-tag practically does not change mean hydrodynamic radius of Ca2+-loaded rat β-PA. The attachment of His-tag shifts thermal denaturation peaks of both apo- and Ca2+-loaded states of rat β-PA towards higher temperatures by 3–4 °C and slightly decreases its Ca2+ affinity. These results should be taken into consideration in the use of His-tagged parvalbumins.

Abstract: Summary
Pharmacologic targeting of components of ERK signaling in ERK-dependent tumors is often limited by adaptive resistance, frequently mediated by feedback-activation of RTK signaling and rebound of ERK activity. Here, we show that combinatorial pharmacologic targeting of ERK signaling and the SHP2 phosphatase prevents adaptive resistance in defined subsets of ERK-dependent tumors. In each tumor that was sensitive to combined treatment, p(Y542)SHP2 induction was observed in response to ERK signaling inhibition. The strategy was broadly effective in TNBC models and tumors with RAS mutations at G12, whereas tumors with RAS(G13D) or RAS(Q61X) mutations were resistant. In addition, we identified a subset of BRAF(V600E) tumors that were resistant to the combined treatment, in which FGFR was found to drive feedback-induced RAS activation, independently of SHP2. Thus, we identify molecular determinants of response to combined ERK signaling and SHP2 inhibition in ERK-dependent tumors.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative translation initiation and stop codon readthrough in a few well-studied cases have been shown to allow the same transcript to generate multiple protein variants. Because the brain shows a particularly abundant use of alternative splicing, we sought to study alternative translation in CNS cells. We show that alternative translation is widespread and regulated across brain transcripts. In neural cultures, we identify alternative initiation on hundreds of transcripts, confirm several N-terminal protein variants, and show the modulation of the phenomenon by KCl stimulation. We also detect readthrough in cultures and show differential levels of normal and readthrough versions of AQP4 in gliotic diseases. Finally, we couple translating ribosome affinity purification to ribosome footprinting (TRAP-RF) for cell-type-specific analysis of neuronal and astrocytic translational readthrough in the mouse brain. We demonstrate that this unappreciated mechanism generates numerous and diverse protein isoforms in a cell-type-specific manner in the brain.

Abstract: Summary
There are abundant peroxiredoxin (Prx) enzymes, but an increase of cellular H2O2 level always happens in apoptotic cells. Here, we show that cellular H2O2 switches different apoptosis pathways depending on which type of Prx enzyme is absent. TNF-α-induced H2O2 burst preferentially activates the DNA damage-dependent apoptosis pathway in the absence of PrxI. By contrast, the same H2O2 burst stimulates the RIPK1-dependent apoptosis pathway in the absence of PrxII by inducing the destruction of cIAP1 in caveolar membrane. Specifically, H2O2 induces the oxidation of Cys308 residue in the cIAP1-BIR3 domain, which induces the dimerization-dependent E3 ligase activation. Thus, the reduction in cIAP level by the absence of PrxII triggers cell-autonomous apoptosis in cancer cells and tumors. Such differential functions of PrxI and PrxII are mediated by interaction with H2AX and cIAP1, respectively. Collectively, this study reveals the distinct switch roles of 2-Cys Prx isoforms in apoptosis signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) forms GP-containing microvesicles, so-called virosomes, which are secreted from GP-expressing cells. However, determinants of GP-virosome release and their functionality are poorly understood. We characterized GP-mediated virosome formation and delineated the role of the antiviral factor tetherin (BST2, CD317) in this process. Residues in the EBOV-GP receptor-binding domain (RBD) promote GP-virosome secretion, while tetherin suppresses GP-virosomes by interactions involving the GP-transmembrane domain. Tetherin from multiple species interfered with GP-virosome release, and tetherin from the natural fruit bat reservoir showed the highest inhibitory activity. Moreover, analyses of GP from various ebolavirus strains, including the EBOV responsible for the West African epidemic, revealed the most efficient GP-virosome formation by highly pathogenic ebolaviruses. Finally, EBOV-GP-virosomes were immunomodulatory and acted as decoys for EBOV-neutralizing antibodies. Our results indicate that GP-virosome formation might be a determinant of EBOV immune evasion and pathogenicity, which is suppressed by tetherin.

Abstract: Summary
Selective autophagy recycles damaged organelles and clears intracellular pathogens to prevent their aberrant accumulation. How ULK1 kinase is targeted and activated during selective autophagic events remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used chemically inducible dimerization (CID) assays in tandem with CRISPR KO lines to systematically analyze the molecular basis of selective autophagosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that ectopic placement of NDP52 on mitochondria or peroxisomes is sufficient to initiate selective autophagy by focally localizing and activating the ULK1 complex. The capability of NDP52 to induce mitophagy is dependent on its interaction with the FIP200/ULK1 complex, which is facilitated by TBK1. Ectopically tethering ULK1 to cargo bypasses the requirement for autophagy receptors and TBK1. Focal activation of ULK1 occurs independently of AMPK and mTOR. Our findings provide a parsimonious model of selective autophagy, which highlights the coordination of ULK1 complex localization by autophagy receptors and TBK1 as principal drivers of targeted autophagosome biogenesis.

Abstract: This study was aimed to explore if lncRNA MALAT1 would modify chemo-resistance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by regulating miR-197-3p and p120 catenin (p120-ctn). Within this investigation, we totally recruited 326 lung cancer patients, and purchased 4 NSCLC cell lines of A549, H1299, SPC-A-1 and H460. Moreover, cisplatin, adriamycin, gefitinib and paclitaxel were arranged as chemotherapies, and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were calculated to evaluate the chemo-resistance of the cells. Furthermore, mice models of NSCLC were also established to assess the impacts of MALAT1, miR-197-3p and p120-ctn on tumor growth. Our results indicated that MALAT1 and miR-197-3p were both over-expressed within NSCLC tissues and cells, when compared with normal tissues and cells (P < 0.05). The A549, H460, SPC-A-1 and SPC-A-1 displayed maximum resistances to cisplatin (IC50 = 15.70 μg/ml), adriamycin (IC50 = 5.58 μg/ml), gefitinib (96.82 μmol/L) and paclitaxel (141.97 nmol/L). Over-expression of MALAT1 and miR-197-3p, or under-expression of p120-ctn were associated with promoted viability and growth of the cancer cells (P < 0.05), and they could significantly strengthen the chemo-resistance of cancer cells (P < 0.05). MALAT1 Wt or p120-ctn Wt co-transfected with miR-197-3p mimic was observed with significantly reduced luciferase activity within NSCLC cells (P < 0.05). Finally, the NSCLC mice models were observed with larger tumor size and weight under circumstances of over-expressed MALAT1 and miR-197-3p, or under-expressed p120-ctn (P < 0.05). In conclusion, MALAT1 could alter chemo-resistance of NSCLC cells by targeting miR-197-3p and regulating p120-ctn expression, which might assist in improvement of chemo-therapies for NSCLC.

Abstract: Summary
Altered excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, but the underlying genetic etiology remains poorly understood. Copy number variations in CYFIP1 are associated with autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability, but its role in regulating synaptic inhibition or E/I balance remains unclear. We show that CYFIP1, and the paralog CYFIP2, are enriched at inhibitory postsynaptic sites. While CYFIP1 or CYFIP2 upregulation increases excitatory synapse number and the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), it has the opposite effect at inhibitory synapses, decreasing their size and the amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). Contrary to CYFIP1 upregulation, its loss in vivo, upon conditional knockout in neocortical principal cells, increases expression of postsynaptic GABAA receptor β2/3-subunits and neuroligin 3, enhancing synaptic inhibition. Thus, CYFIP1 dosage can bi-directionally impact inhibitory synaptic structure and function, potentially leading to altered E/I balance and circuit dysfunction in CYFIP1-associated neurological disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription of the proto-oncogene SPHK1 is regulated by KHPS1, an antisense RNA that activates SPHK1 expression by forming a triple-helical RNA-DNA-DNA structure at the SPHK1 enhancer. Triplex-mediated tethering of KHPS1 to its target gene is required for recruitment of E2F1 and p300 and transcription of the RNA derived from the SPHK1 enhancer (eRNA-Sphk1). eRNA-Sphk1 evicts CTCF, which insulates the enhancer from the SPHK1 promoter, thus facilitating SPHK1 expression. Genomic deletion of the triplex-forming sequence attenuates SPHK1 expression, leading to decreased cell migration and invasion. Replacement of the triplex-forming region (TFR) of KHPS1 by the TFR of the lncRNA MEG3 tethers KHPS1 to the MEG3 target gene TGFBR1, underscoring the interchangeability and anchoring function of sequences involved in triplex formation. Altogether, the results reveal a triplex-driven feedforward mechanism involving lncRNA-dependent induction of eRNA, which enhances expression of specific target genes.

Abstract: Summary
Imaging voltage using fluorescent-based sensors could be an ideal technique to probe neural circuits with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, due to insufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), imaging membrane potential in mammalian preparations is still challenging. In recent years, many genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) have been developed. To compare them and guide decisions on which GEVI to use, we have characterized side by side the performance of eight GEVIs that represent different families of molecular constructs. We tested GEVIs in vitro with 1-photon imaging and in vivo with 1-photon wide-field imaging and 2-photon imaging. We find that QuasAr2 exhibited the best performance in vitro, whereas only ArcLight-MT could be used to reliably detect electrical activity in vivo with 2-photon excitation. No single GEVI was ideal for every experiment. These results provide a guide for choosing optimal GEVIs for specific applications.

Abstract: Summary
Hippo signaling and the activity of its transcriptional coactivator, Yorkie (Yki), are conserved and crucial regulators of tissue homeostasis. In the Drosophila midgut, after tissue damage, Yki activity increases to stimulate stem cell proliferation, but how Yki activity is turned off once the tissue is repaired is unknown. From an RNAi screen, we identified the septate junction (SJ) protein tetraspanin 2A (Tsp2A) as a tumor suppressor. Tsp2A undergoes internalization to facilitate the endocytic degradation of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), a negative regulator of Hippo signaling. In the Drosophila midgut epithelium, adherens junctions (AJs) and SJs are prominent in intestinal stem cells or enteroblasts (ISCs or EBs) and enterocytes (ECs), respectively. We show that when ISCs differentiate toward ECs, Tsp2A is produced, participates in SJ assembly, and turns off aPKC and Yki-JAK-Stat activity. Altogether, our study uncovers a mechanism allowing the midgut to restore Hippo signaling and restrict proliferation once tissue repair is accomplished.

Abstract: Successful gametogenesis in invertebrates is tightly associated with functioning of specific nutrient-storing cells. In oysters, cells of vesicular connective tissue (VCT-cells), also referred to as storage cells, which form a meshwork around gonadal acini, are the major population of cells that accumulate and provide nutrients for developing gametes. During the annual reproductive cycle, populations of developing germ cells and VCT-cells demonstrate the inversely proportional size dynamics: the larger the acini, the smaller the VCT-cells. In the present study, the morphology of VCT-cells in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, at the active gametogenesis stage of reproductive cycle has been studied using light and transmission electron microscopy. At this stage, VCT-cells are big, irregularly shaped cells containing large nucleus with a single large nucleolus. The cytoplasm contains weakly developed endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria in the perinuclear area and at periphery of the cell, numerous lipid droplets, and glycogen particles. Ultrastructure of VCT-cells is similar to the organization of brown adipocytes in mammals. The surface of cells has numerous cytoplasmic processes that are presumably associated with the transport function and provide close interaction with adjacent cells. The spatial relationship between VCT-cells and myoepithelial elements of the gonad area is demonstrated and discussed.

Abstract: Summary
Several large-scale genome-wide association studies genetically linked IRGM to Crohn’s disease and other inflammatory disorders in which the IRGM appears to have a protective function. However, the mechanism by which IRGM accomplishes this anti-inflammatory role remains unclear. Here, we reveal that IRGM/Irgm1 is a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We show that IRGM expression, which is increased by PAMPs, DAMPs, and microbes, can suppress the pro-inflammatory responses provoked by the same stimuli. IRGM/Irgm1 negatively regulates IL-1β maturation by suppressing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mechanistically, we show that IRGM interacts with NLRP3 and ASC and hinders inflammasome assembly by blocking their oligomerization. Further, IRGM mediates selective autophagic degradation of NLRP3 and ASC. By suppressing inflammasome activation, IRGM/Irgm1 protects from pyroptosis and gut inflammation in a Crohn’s disease experimental mouse model. This study for the first time identifies the mechanism by which IRGM is protective against inflammatory disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The ability to distinguish harmful and beneficial microbes is critical for the survival of an organism. Here, we show that bloating of the intestinal lumen of Caenorhabditis elegans caused by microbial colonization elicits a microbial aversion behavior. Bloating of the intestinal lumen also activates a broad innate immune response, even in the absence of bacterial pathogens or live bacteria. Neuroendocrine pathway genes are upregulated by intestinal bloating and are required for microbial aversion behavior. We propose that microbial colonization and bloating of the intestine may be perceived as a danger signal that activates an immune fight-and-flight response. These results reveal how inputs from the intestine can aid in the recognition of a broad range of microbes and modulate host behavior via neuroendocrine signaling.

Abstract: Cetacean mechanical senses, such as hearing, echolocation, active touch and the perception of water movements, are essential for their survival. Dolphins skin possesses dense packing of dermal papillae associated with the cutaneous ridges that suggests a sensory function, furthermore they are well innervated and very sensitive to touch. This is mediated by mechanoreceptors, abundant in the region of the head and in the dorsal part of the body. Most odontocetes possess vibrissae (i.e., sensory hair) that have been well described in literature and present a microanatomy similar to that of terrestrial mammals. The aim of this study was to characterize Merkel cell through use of specific antibodies: Substance P, Anti-calbindin DK28, Anti-5HT, Leu- enkephalin, Protein Gene Product 9.5 (PGP9.5) and Anti-Human Neuronal Protein, for the first time. Merkel cells (MCs) in the dolphin skin are specialized skin receptors, characterized by their particular location and close association with nerve terminals. The presence of neuroendocrine markers and different neuropeptides confirms that MCs play also neuroendocrine function and are considered as part of the diffuse neuroendocrine system. Furthermore, the presence of Leu-enkephalin in Merkel cells could involve these cells in inflammatory responses in the skin.

Abstract: Summary
Dysregulation of chromatin methylation is associated with defects in cellular differentiation as well as a variety of cancers. How cells regulate the opposing activities of histone methyltransferase and demethylase enzymes to set the methylation status of the epigenome for proper control of gene expression and metabolism remains poorly understood. Here, we show that loss of methylation of the major phosphatase PP2A in response to methionine starvation activates the demethylation of histones through hyperphosphorylation of specific demethylase enzymes. In parallel, this regulatory mechanism enables cells to preserve SAM by increasing SAH to limit SAM consumption by methyltransferase enzymes. Mutants lacking the PP2A methyltransferase or the effector H3K36 demethylase Rph1 exhibit elevated SAM levels and are dependent on cysteine due to reduced capacity to sink the methyl groups of SAM. Therefore, PP2A directs the methylation status of histones by regulating the phosphorylation status of histone demethylase enzymes in response to SAM levels.

Abstract: Summary
We used whole-organ mapping to study the locoregional molecular changes in a human bladder containing multifocal cancer. Widespread DNA methylation changes were identified in the entire mucosa, representing the initial field effect. The field effect was associated with subclonal low-allele frequency mutations and a small number of DNA copy alterations. A founder mutation in the RNA splicing gene, ACIN1, was identified in normal mucosa and expanded clonally with an additional 21 mutations in progression to carcinoma. The patterns of mutations and copy number changes in carcinoma in situ and foci of carcinoma were almost identical, confirming their clonal origins. The pathways affected by the DNA copy alterations and mutations, including the Kras pathway, were preceded by the field changes in DNA methylation, suggesting that they reinforced mechanisms that had already been initiated by methylation. The results demonstrate that DNA methylation can serve as the initiator of bladder carcinogenesis.

Abstract: Ependymal cells constitute the multi-ciliated epithelium, which lines the brain ventricular lumen. Although ependymal cells originate from radial glial cells in the perinatal rodent brain, the exact mechanisms underlying the full differentiation of ependymal cells are poorly understood. In this report, we present evidence that the Anks1a phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB) adaptor is required for the proper development of ependymal cells in the rodent postnatal brain. Anks1a gene trap targeted LacZ reporter analysis revealed that Anks1a is expressed prominently in the ventricular region of the early postnatal brain and that its expression is restricted to mature ependymal cells during postnatal brain development. In addition, Anks1a-deficient ependymal cells were shown to possess type B cell characteristics, suggesting that ependymal cells require Anks1a in order to be fully differentiated. Finally, Anks1a overexpression in the lateral wall of the neonatal brain resulted in an increase in the number of ependymal cells during postnatal brain development. Altogether, our results suggest that ependymal cells require Anks1a PTB adaptor for their proper development.

Abstract: Summary
The necessity of mesenchymal stromal cells, called fibroadipogenic progenitors (FAPs), in skeletal muscle regeneration and maintenance remains unestablished. We report the generation of a PDGFRαCreER knockin mouse model that provides a specific means of labeling and targeting FAPs. Depletion of FAPs using Cre-dependent diphtheria toxin expression results in loss of expansion of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and CD45+ hematopoietic cells after injury and impaired skeletal muscle regeneration. Furthermore, FAP-depleted mice under homeostatic conditions exhibit muscle atrophy and loss of MuSCs, revealing that FAPs are required for the maintenance of both skeletal muscle and the MuSC pool. We also report that local tamoxifen metabolite delivery to target CreER activity in a single muscle, removing potentially confounding systemic effects of ablating PDGFRα+ cells distantly, also causes muscle atrophy. These data establish a critical role of FAPs in skeletal muscle regeneration and maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
The detailed molecular characterization of lethal cancers is a prerequisite to understanding resistance to therapy and escape from cancer immunoediting. We performed extensive multi-platform profiling of multi-regional metastases in autopsies from 10 patients with therapy-resistant breast cancer. The integrated genomic and immune landscapes show that metastases propagate and evolve as communities of clones, reveal their predicted neo-antigen landscapes, and show that they can accumulate HLA loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The data further identify variable tumor microenvironments and reveal, through analyses of T cell receptor repertoires, that adaptive immune responses appear to co-evolve with the metastatic genomes. These findings reveal in fine detail the landscapes of lethal metastatic breast cancer.

While neurons in the cortex can remodel after input loss, the contributions of cell-type-specific circuits to resilience are unknown. Here, we study the effects of partial cone loss in mature mouse retina where cell types and connections are known. At first-order synapses, bipolar cell dendrites remodel and synaptic proteins diminish at sites of input loss. Sites of remaining inputs preserve synaptic proteins. Second-order synapses between bipolar and ganglion cells remain stable. Functionally, ganglion cell spatio-temporal receptive fields retain center-surround structure following partial cone loss. We find evidence for slower temporal filters and expanded receptive field surrounds, derived mainly from inhibitory inputs. Surround expansion is absent in partially stimulated control retina. Results demonstrate functional resilience to input loss beyond pre-existing mechanisms in control retina.

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of cancer drug resistance is a critical challenge in cancer therapy. For many cancer drugs, various resistance mechanisms have been identified such as target alteration, alternative signaling pathways, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and epigenetic modulation. Resistance may arise via multiple mechanisms even for a single drug, making it necessary to investigate multiple independent models for comprehensive understanding and therapeutic application. In particular, we hypothesize that different resistance processes result in distinct gene expression changes. Here, we present a web-based database, CDRgator (Cancer Drug Resistance navigator) for comparative analysis of gene expression signatures of cancer drug resistance. Resistance signatures were extracted from two different types of datasets. First, resistance signatures were extracted from transcriptomic profiles of cancer cells or patient samples and their resistance-induced counterparts for >30 cancer drugs. Second, drug resistance group signatures were also extracted from two large-scale drug sensitivity datasets representing ~1,000 cancer cell lines. All the datasets are available for download, and are conveniently accessible based on drug class and cancer type, along with analytic features such as clustering analysis, multidimensional scaling, and pathway analysis. CDRgator allows meta-analysis of independent resistance models for more comprehensive understanding of drug-resistance mechanisms that is difficult to accomplish with individual datasets alone (database URL: http://cdrgator.ewha.ac.kr).

Abstract: Summary
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease characterized by hyperglycemia due to progressive loss of pancreatic beta cells. Immune-mediated beta cell destruction drives the disease, but whether beta cells actively participate in the pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that during the natural history of T1D in humans and the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model, a subset of beta cells acquires a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent beta cells upregulated pro-survival mediator Bcl-2, and treatment of NOD mice with Bcl-2 inhibitors selectively eliminated these cells without altering the abundance of the immune cell types involved in the disease. Significantly, elimination of senescent beta cells halted immune-mediated beta cell destruction and was sufficient to prevent diabetes. Our findings demonstrate that beta cell senescence is a significant component of the pathogenesis of T1D and indicate that clearance of senescent beta cells could be a new therapeutic approach for T1D.

Abstract: Summary
The development of autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (T1D) is determined by both genetic background and environmental factors. Environmental triggers include RNA viruses, particularly coxsackievirus (CV), but how they induce T1D is not understood. Here, we demonstrate that deletion of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) from β cells increases the susceptibility of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice to environmentally triggered T1D from coxsackieviruses and the β cell toxin streptozotocin. Similarly, knockdown of HIF-1α in human islets leads to a poorer response to coxsackievirus infection. Studies in coxsackievirus-infected islets demonstrate that lack of HIF-1α leads to impaired viral clearance, increased viral load, inflammation, pancreatitis, and loss of β cell mass. These findings show an important role for β cells and, specifically, lack of β cell HIF-1α in the development of T1D. These data suggest new strategies for the prevention of T1D.

Abstract: Summary
The proximodistal axis is considered a major organizational principle of the hippocampus. At the interface between the hippocampus and other brain structures, CA2 apparently breaks this rule. The region is involved in social, temporal, and contextual memory function, but mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we reveal cell-type heterogeneity and a characteristic expression gradient of the transcription factor Sox5 within CA2 in the rat. Using intracellular and extracellular recordings followed by neurochemical identification of single cells, we find marked proximodistal trends of synaptic activity, subthreshold membrane potentials, and phase-locked firing coupled to theta and gamma oscillations. Phase-shifting membrane potentials and opposite proximodistal correlations with theta sinks and sources at different layers support influences from different current generators. CA2 oscillatory activity and place coding of rats running in a linear maze reflect proximodistal state-dependent trends. We suggest that the structure and function of CA2 are distributed along the proximodistal hippocampal axis.

Abstract: Summary
Biological systems must possess mechanisms that prevent inappropriate responses to spurious environmental inputs. Caenorhabditis elegans has two breakdown pathways for the short-chain fatty acid propionate: a canonical, vitamin B12-dependent pathway and a propionate shunt that is used when vitamin B12 levels are low. The shunt pathway is kept off when there is sufficient flux through the canonical pathway, likely to avoid generating shunt-specific toxic intermediates. Here, we discovered a transcriptional regulatory circuit that activates shunt gene expression upon propionate buildup. Nuclear hormone receptor 10 (NHR-10) and NHR-68 function together as a “persistence detector” in a type 1, coherent feed-forward loop with an AND-logic gate to delay shunt activation upon propionate accumulation and to avoid spurious shunt activation in response to a non-sustained pulse of propionate. Together, our findings identify a persistence detector in an animal, which transcriptionally rewires propionate metabolism to maintain homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have the worst prognosis and distant metastasis-free survival among all major subtypes of breast cancer. The poor clinical outlook is further exacerbated by a lack of effective targeted therapies for TNBC. Here we show that ectopic expression and therapeutic delivery of the secreted protein Tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen-like 1 (Tinagl1) suppresses TNBC progression and metastasis through direct binding to integrin α5β1, αvβ1, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and subsequent simultaneous inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and EGFR signaling pathways. Moreover, Tinagl1 protein level is associated with good prognosis and reversely correlates with FAK and EGFR activation status in TNBC. Our results suggest Tinagl1 as a candidate therapeutic agent for TNBC by dual inhibition of integrin/FAK and EGFR signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Most human cancers originate from high-turnover tissues, while low-proliferating tissues, like skeletal muscle, exhibit a lower incidence of tumor development. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which induces increased skeletal muscle regeneration, tumor incidence is increased. Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs), a rare and aggressive type of soft tissue sarcoma, can develop in this context, but the impact of DMD severity on RMS development and its cell of origin are poorly understood. Here, we show that RMS latency is affected by DMD severity and that muscle stem cells (MuSCs) can give rise to RMS in dystrophic mice. We report that even before tumor formation, MuSCs exhibit increased self-renewal and an expression signature associated with RMSs. These cells can form tumorspheres in vitro and give rise to RMSs in vivo. Finally, we show that the inflammatory genes Ccl11 and Rgs5 are involved in RMS growth. Together, our results show that DMD severity drives MuSC-mediated RMS development.

Abstract: Summary
In Caenorhabditis elegans, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutation or toxins activates programs of detoxification and immune response. A genetic screen for mutations that constitutively induce C. elegans mitochondrial defense revealed reduction-of-function mutations in the mitochondrial chaperone hsp-6/mtHSP70 and gain-of-function mutations in the Mediator component mdt-15/MED15. The activation of detoxification and immune responses is transcriptionally mediated by mdt-15/MED15 and nuclear hormone receptor nhr-45. Mitochondrial dysfunction triggers redistribution of intestinal mitochondria, which requires the mitochondrial Rho GTPase miro-1 and its adaptor trak-1/TRAK1, but not nhr-45-regulated responses. Disabling the mdt-15/nhr-45 pathway renders animals more susceptible to a mitochondrial toxin or pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa but paradoxically improves health and extends lifespan in animals with mitochondrial dysfunction caused by a mutation. Thus, some of the health deficits in mitochondrial disorders may be caused by the ineffective activation of detoxification and immune responses, which may be inhibited to improve health.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling systems expand by duplications of various components, be it receptors or downstream effectors. However, whether and how duplicated components contribute to higher signaling capacity is unclear, especially because in most cases, their specificities overlap. Using information theory, we found that augmentation of capacity by an increase in the copy number is strongly limited by logarithmic diminishing returns. Moreover, counter to conventional biochemical wisdom, refinements of the response mechanism, e.g., by cooperativity or allostery, do not increase the overall signaling capacity. However, signaling capacity nearly doubles when a promiscuous, non-cognate ligand becomes explicitly recognized via duplication and partial divergence of signaling components. Our findings suggest that expansion of signaling components via duplication and enlistment of promiscuously acting cues is virtually the only accessible evolutionary strategy to achieve overall high-signaling capacity despite overlapping specificities and molecular noise. This mode of expansion also explains the highly cross-wired architecture of signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
BRCA1 or BRCA2 inactivation drives breast and ovarian cancer but also creates vulnerability to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. To search for additional targets whose inhibition is synthetically lethal in BRCA2-deficient backgrounds, we screened two pairs of BRCA2 isogenic cell lines with DNA-repair-focused small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based libraries. We found that BRCA2-deficient cells are selectively dependent on multiple pathways including base excision repair, ATR signaling, and splicing. We identified APEX2 and FEN1 as synthetic lethal genes with both BRCA1 and BRCA2 loss of function. BRCA2-deficient cells require the apurinic endonuclease activity and the PCNA-binding domain of Ape2 (APEX2), but not Ape1 (APEX1). Furthermore, BRCA2-deficient cells require the 5′ flap endonuclease but not the 5′-3′ exonuclease activity of Fen1, and chemically inhibiting Fen1 selectively targets BRCA-deficient cells. Finally, we developed a microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) reporter and showed that Fen1 participates in MMEJ, underscoring the importance of MMEJ as a collateral repair pathway in the context of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome is the most abundant RNA-protein complex in a cell, and many copies of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) have to be maintained. However, arrays of tandemly repeated rDNA genes can lose the copies by intra-repeat recombination. Loss of the rDNA copies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is counteracted by gene amplification whereby the number of rDNA repeats stabilizes around 150 copies, suggesting the presence of a monitoring mechanism that counts and adjusts the number. Here, we report that, in response to rDNA copy loss, the upstream activating factor (UAF) for RNA polymerase I that transcribes the rDNA is released and directly binds to a RNA polymerase II-transcribed gene, SIR2, whose gene products silence rDNA recombination, to repress. We show that the amount of UAF determines the rDNA copy number that is stably maintained. UAF ensures rDNA production not only by rDNA transcription activation but also by its copy-number maintenance.

Abstract: Summary
Multisite phosphorylation of kinases can induce on-off or graded regulation of catalytic activity; however, its influence on substrate specificity remains unclear. Here, we show that multisite phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) alters target selection. Agonist-inducible phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) by S6K1 in monocytes and adipocytes requires not only canonical phosphorylation at Thr389 by mTORC1 but also phosphorylation at Ser424 and Ser429 in the C terminus by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). S6K1 phosphorylation at these additional sites induces a conformational switch and is essential for high-affinity binding and phosphorylation of EPRS, but not canonical S6K1 targets, e.g., ribosomal protein S6. Unbiased proteomic analysis identified additional targets phosphorylated by multisite phosphorylated S6K1 in insulin-stimulated adipocytes—namely, coenzyme A synthase, lipocalin 2, and cortactin. Thus, embedded within S6K1 is a target-selective kinase phospho-code that integrates signals from mTORC1 and Cdk5 to direct an insulin-stimulated, post-translational metabolon determining adipocyte lipid metabolism.

Abstract: Summary
Viral-genetic tracing techniques have enabled mesoscale mapping of neuronal connectivity by teasing apart inputs to defined neuronal populations in regions with heterogeneous cell types. We previously observed input biases to output-defined ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTA-DA) neurons. Here, we further dissect connectivity in the VTA by defining input-output relations of neurochemically and output-defined neuronal populations. By expanding our analysis to include input patterns to subtypes of excitatory (vGluT2-expressing) or inhibitory (GAD2-expressing) populations, we find that the output site, rather than neurochemical phenotype, correlates with whole-brain inputs of each subpopulation. Lastly, we find that biases in input maps to different VTA neurons can be generated using publicly available whole-brain output mapping datasets. Our comprehensive dataset and detailed spatial analysis suggest that connection specificity in the VTA is largely a function of the spatial location of the cells within the VTA.

Abstract: Summary
It has recently been reported that a common side effect of translation-blocking morpholino antisense oligonucleotides is the induction of a set of innate immune response genes in Xenopus embryos and that splicing-blocking morpholinos lead to unexpected off-target mis-splicing events. Here, we present an analysis of all publicly available Xenopus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data in a reexamination of the effects of translation-blocking morpholinos on the innate immune response. Our analysis does not support the authors’ general conclusion, which was based on a limited number of RNA-seq datasets. Moreover, the strong induction of an immune response appears to be specific to the tbxt/tbxt2 morpholinos. The more comprehensive study presented here indicates that using morpholinos for targeted gene knockdowns remains of considerable value for the rapid identification of gene function.

Abstract: Summary
Cell dormancy is a widespread mechanism used by bacteria to evade environmental threats, including antibiotics. Here we monitored bacterial antibiotic tolerance and regrowth at the single-cell level and found that each individual survival cell shows different “dormancy depth,” which in return regulates the lag time for cell resuscitation after removal of antibiotic. We further established that protein aggresome—a collection of endogenous protein aggregates—is an important indicator of bacterial dormancy depth, whose formation is promoted by decreased cellular ATP level. For cells to leave the dormant state and resuscitate, clearance of protein aggresome and recovery of proteostasis are required. We revealed that the ability to recruit functional DnaK-ClpB machineries, which facilitate protein disaggregation in an ATP-dependent manner, determines the lag time for bacterial regrowth. Better understanding of the key factors regulating bacterial regrowth after surviving antibiotic attack could lead to new therapeutic strategies for combating bacterial antibiotic tolerance.

Abstract: Summary
Viral vectors enable foreign proteins to be expressed in brains of non-genetic species, including non-human primates. However, viruses targeting specific neuron classes have proved elusive. Here we describe viral promoters and strategies for accessing GABAergic interneurons and their molecularly defined subsets in the rodent and primate. Using a set intersection approach, which relies on two co-active promoters, we can restrict heterologous protein expression to cortical and hippocampal somatostatin-positive and parvalbumin-positive interneurons. With an orthogonal set difference method, we can enrich for subclasses of neuropeptide-Y-positive GABAergic interneurons by effectively subtracting the expression pattern of one promoter from that of another. These methods harness the complexity of gene expression patterns in the brain and significantly expand the number of genetically tractable neuron classes across mammals.

Abstract: Summary
The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a highly conserved master regulator of metabolism, whose activation has been proposed to be therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of several metabolic diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD, characterized by excessive accumulation of hepatic lipids, is the most common chronic liver disease and a major risk factor for development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic conditions. To assess the therapeutic potential of AMPK activation, we have generated a genetically engineered mouse model, termed iAMPKCA, where AMPK can be inducibly activated in vivo in mice in a spatially and temporally restricted manner. Using this model, we show that liver-specific AMPK activation reprograms lipid metabolism, reduces liver steatosis, decreases expression of inflammation and fibrosis genes, and leads to significant therapeutic benefits in the context of diet-induced obesity. These findings further support AMPK as a target for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

Abstract: Summary
RhoA stimulates cell contractility by recruiting downstream effectors to the cortical plasma membrane. We now show that direct binding by anillin is required for effective signaling: this antagonizes the otherwise labile membrane association of GTP-RhoA to promote effector recruitment. However, since its binding to RhoA blocks access by other effectors, we demonstrate that anillin must also concentrate membrane phosphoinositide-4,5-P2 (PIP2) to promote signaling. We propose and test a sequential pathway where GTP-RhoA first binds to anillin and then is retained at the membrane by PIP2 after it disengages from anillin. Importantly, re-binding of membrane GTP-RhoA to anillin, regulated by the cortical density of anillin, creates cycles through this pathway. These cycles repeatedly reset the dissociation kinetics of GTP-RhoA, substantially increasing its dwell time to recruit effectors. Thus, anillin regulates RhoA signaling by a paradigm of kinetic scaffolding that may apply to other signals whose efficacy depends on their cortical dwell times.

Abstract: The application of mechanical stimuli to cells often induce increases in intracellular calcium, affecting the regulation of a variety of cell functions. Although the mechanism of mechanotransduction-induced calcium increases has not been fully resolved, the involvement of mechanosensitive ion channels in the plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum has been reported. Here, we demonstrate that voltage-gated L-type calcium channels play a critical role in the mechanosensitive calcium response in H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes. The intracellular calcium level in H9c2 cells increased in a reproducible dose-dependent manner in response to uniaxial stretching. The stretch-activated calcium response (SICR) completely disappeared in calcium-free medium, whereas thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid, inhibitors of sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, partially reduced the SICR. These findings suggest that both calcium influx across the cell membrane and calcium release from the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum are involved in the SICR. Nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil, inhibitors of L-type calcium channels, reduced the SICR in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, small interfering RNA against the L-type calcium channel α1c subunit diminished the SICR dramatically. Nifedipine also diminished the mechanosensitivity of Langendorff-perfused rat heart. These results suggest that the SICR in H9c2 cardiomyocytes involves the activation of L-type calcium channels and subsequent calcium release from the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum.

Abstract: The liver is involved in a wide range of activities in vertebrates and some other animals, including metabolism, protein synthesis, detoxification, and the immune system. Until now, various methods have been devised to study liver diseases; however, each method has its own limitations. In situ liver perfusion machinery, originally developed in rats, has been successfully adapted to mice, enabling the study of liver diseases. Here we describe the protocol, which is a simple but widely applicable method for investigating the liver diseases. The liver is perfused in situ by cannulation of the portal vein and suprahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC), with antegrade closed circuit circulation completed by clamping the infrahepatic IVC. In situ liver perfusion can be utilized to evaluate immune cell migration and function, hemodynamics and related cellular reactions in each type of hepatic cells, and the metabolism of toxic or other compounds by changing the composition of the circulating media. In situ liver perfusion method maintains liver function and cell viability for up to 2 h. This study also describes an optional protocol using density-gradient centrifugation for the separation of different types of hepatic cells, allowing the determination of changes in each cell type. In summary, this method of in situ liver perfusion will be useful for studying liver diseases as a complement to other established methods.

Abstract: Summary
Exon junction complexes (EJCs) loaded onto spliced mRNAs during splicing serve as molecular markers for various post-transcriptional gene-regulatory processes, including nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Although the composition and structure of EJCs are well characterized, the mechanism regulating EJC deposition remains unknown. Here we find that threonine 163 (T163) within the RNA-binding motif of eIF4A3 (a core EJC component) is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent protein kinases 1 and 2 in a cell cycle-dependent manner. T163 phosphorylation hinders binding of eIF4A3 to spliced mRNAs and other EJC components. Instead, it promotes association of eIF4A3 with CWC22, which guides eIF4A3 to an active spliceosome. These molecular events ensure the fidelity of specific deposition of the EJC ∼20–24 nt upstream of an exon-exon junction. Accordingly, NMD is affected by T163 phosphorylation. Collectively, our data provide evidence that T163 phosphorylation affects EJC formation and, consequently, NMD efficiency in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells heavily depend on the amino acid glutamine to meet the demands associated with growth and proliferation. Due to the rapid consumption of glutamine, cancer cells frequently undergo glutamine starvation in vivo. We and others have shown that p53 is a critical regulator in metabolic stress resistance. To better understand the molecular mechanisms by which p53 activation promotes cancer cell adaptation to glutamine deprivation, we identified p53-dependent genes that are induced upon glutamine deprivation by using RNA-seq analysis. We show that Slc7a3, an arginine transporter, is significantly induced by p53. We also show that increased intracellular arginine levels following glutamine deprivation are dependent on p53. The influx of arginine has minimal effects on known metabolic pathways upon glutamine deprivation. Instead, we found arginine serves as an effector for mTORC1 activation to promote cell growth in response to glutamine starvation. Therefore, we identify a p53-inducible gene that contributes to the metabolic stress response.

Abstract: Summary
We report that circACC1, a circular RNA derived from human ACC1, plays a critical role in cellular responses to metabolic stress. CircACC1 is preferentially produced over ACC1 in response to serum deprivation by the transcription factor c-Jun. It functions to stabilize and promote the enzymatic activity of the AMPK holoenzyme by forming a ternary complex with the regulatory β and γ subunits. The cellular levels of circACC1 modulate both fatty acid β-oxidation and glycolysis, resulting in profound changes in cellular lipid storage. In a tumor xenograft model, silencing or enforced expression of circACC1 resulted in growth inhibition and enhancement, respectively. Moreover, increased AMPK activation in colorectal cancer tissues was frequently associated with elevated circACC1 expression. We conclude that circACC1 serves as an economic means to elicit AMPK activation and moreover propose that cancer cells exploit circACC1 during metabolic reprogramming.

Abstract: Summary
Distinct mechanisms involving cell shape and mechanical force are known to influence the rate and orientation of division in cultured cells. However, uncoupling the impact of shape and force in tissues remains challenging. Combining stretching of Xenopus tissue with mathematical methods of inferring relative mechanical stress, we find separate roles for cell shape and mechanical stress in orienting and cueing division. We demonstrate that division orientation is best predicted by an axis of cell shape defined by the position of tricellular junctions (TCJs), which align with local cell stress rather than tissue-level stress. The alignment of division to cell shape requires functional cadherin and the localization of the spindle orientation protein, LGN, to TCJs but is not sensitive to relative cell stress magnitude. In contrast, proliferation rate is more directly regulated by mechanical stress, being correlated with relative isotropic stress and decoupled from cell shape when myosin II is depleted.

Abstract: Summary
Signaling from chemoattractant receptors activates the cytoskeleton of crawling cells for chemotaxis. We show using phosphoproteomics that different chemoattractants cause phosphorylation of the same core set of around 80 proteins in Dictyostelium cells. Strikingly, the majority of these are phosphorylated at an [S/T]PR motif by the atypical MAP kinase ErkB. Unlike most chemotactic responses, ErkB phosphorylations are persistent and do not adapt to sustained stimulation with chemoattractant. ErkB integrates dynamic autophosphorylation with chemotactic signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors. Downstream, our phosphoproteomics data define a broad panel of regulators of chemotaxis. Surprisingly, targets are almost exclusively other signaling proteins, rather than cytoskeletal components, revealing ErkB as a regulator of regulators rather than acting directly on the motility machinery. ErkB null cells migrate slowly and orientate poorly over broad dynamic ranges of chemoattractant. Our data indicate a central role for ErkB and its substrates in directing chemotaxis.

Abstract: Summary
Cellular senescence entails a stable cell-cycle arrest and a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype, which contributes to aging and age-related diseases. Obesity is associated with increased senescent cell burden and neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression. To investigate the role of senescence in obesity-related neuropsychiatric dysfunction, we used the INK-ATTAC mouse model, from which p16Ink4a-expressing senescent cells can be eliminated, and senolytic drugs dasatinib and quercetin. We found that obesity results in the accumulation of senescent glial cells in proximity to the lateral ventricle, a region in which adult neurogenesis occurs. Furthermore, senescent glial cells exhibit excessive fat deposits, a phenotype we termed “accumulation of lipids in senescence.” Clearing senescent cells from high fat-fed or leptin receptor-deficient obese mice restored neurogenesis and alleviated anxiety-related behavior. Our study provides proof-of-concept evidence that senescent cells are major contributors to obesity-induced anxiety and that senolytics are a potential new therapeutic avenue for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Endocannabinoids acting on the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) or ghrelin acting on its receptor (GHS-R1A) both promote alcohol-seeking behavior, but an interaction between the two signaling systems has not been explored. Here, we report that the peripheral CB1R inverse agonist JD5037 reduces ethanol drinking in wild-type mice but not in mice lacking CB1R, ghrelin peptide or GHS-R1A. JD5037 treatment of alcohol-drinking mice inhibits the formation of biologically active octanoyl-ghrelin without affecting its inactive precursor desacyl-ghrelin. In ghrelin-producing stomach cells, JD5037 reduced the level of the substrate octanoyl-carnitine generated from palmitoyl-carnitine by increasing fatty acid β-oxidation. Blocking gastric vagal afferents abrogated the ability of either CB1R or GHS-R1A blockade to reduce ethanol drinking. We conclude that blocking CB1R in ghrelin-producing cells reduces alcohol drinking by inhibiting the formation of active ghrelin and its signaling via gastric vagal afferents. Thus, peripheral CB1R blockade may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of alcoholism.

Abstract: The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that comprises approximately 10%–20% of breast cancers is an aggressive subtype lacking effective therapeutics. Among various signaling pathways, mTORC1 and purinergic signals have emerged as potentially fruitful targets for clinical therapy of TNBC. Unfortunately, drugs targeting these signaling pathways do not successfully inhibit the progression of TNBC, partially due to the fact that these signaling pathways are essential for the function of all types of cells. In this study, we report that TRPML1 is specifically upregulated in TNBCs and that its genetic downregulation and pharmacological inhibition suppress the growth of TNBC. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TRPML1 regulates TNBC development, at least partially, through controlling mTORC1 activity and the release of lysosomal ATP. Because TRPML1 is specifically activated by cellular stresses found in tumor microenvironments, antagonists of TRPML1 could represent anticancer drugs with enhanced specificity and potency. Our findings are expected to have a major impact on drug targeting of TNBCs.

Abstract: Summary
Nucleosome organization has a key role in transcriptional regulation, yet the precise mechanisms establishing nucleosome locations and their effect on transcription are unclear. Here, we use an induced degradation system to screen all yeast ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. We characterize how rapid clearance of the remodeler affects nucleosome locations. Specifically, depletion of Sth1, the catalytic subunit of the RSC (remodel the structure of chromatin) complex, leads to rapid fill-in of nucleosome-free regions at gene promoters. These changes are reversible upon reintroduction of Sth1 and do not depend on DNA replication. RSC-dependent nucleosome positioning is pivotal in maintaining promoters of lowly expressed genes free from nucleosomes. In contrast, we observe that upon acute stress, the RSC is not necessary for the transcriptional response. Moreover, RSC-dependent nucleosome positions are tightly related to usage of specific transcription start sites. Our results suggest organizational principles that determine nucleosome positions with and without RSC and how these interact with the transcriptional process.

Abstract: Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are loaded into the Argonaute subfamily of proteins (AGO) to form an effector complex that silences target genes. Empty but not miRNA-loaded AGO is selectively degraded across species. However, the mechanism and biological significance of selective AGO degradation remain unclear. We discovered a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase we named Iruka (Iru), which selectively ubiquitinates the empty form of Drosophila Ago1 to trigger its degradation. Iru preferentially binds empty Ago1 and ubiquitinates Lys514 in the L2 linker, which is predicted to be inaccessible in the miRNA-loaded state. Depletion of Iru results in global impairment of miRNA-mediated silencing of target genes and in the accumulation of aberrant Ago1 that is dysfunctional for canonical protein-protein interactions and miRNA loading. Our findings reveal a sophisticated mechanism for the selective degradation of empty AGO that underlies a quality control process to ensure AGO function.

Abstract: Summary
Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a surveillance system that degrades mRNAs containing a premature termination codon (PTC) and plays important roles in protein homeostasis and disease. The efficiency of NMD is variable, impacting the clinical outcome of genetic mutations. However, limited resolution of bulk analyses has hampered the study of NMD efficiency. Here, we develop an assay to visualize NMD of individual mRNA molecules in real time. We find that NMD occurs with equal probability during each round of translation of an mRNA molecule. However, this probability is variable and depends on the exon sequence downstream of the PTC, the PTC-to-intron distance, and the number of introns both upstream and downstream of the PTC. Additionally, a subpopulation of mRNAs can escape NMD, further contributing to variation in NMD efficiency. Our study uncovers real-time dynamics of NMD, reveals key mechanisms that influence NMD efficiency, and provides a powerful method to study NMD.

Abstract: Summary
Fc receptor for IgM (FcμR)-deficient mice display dysregulated function of neutrophils, dendritic cells, and B cells. The relevance of FcμR to human T cells is still unknown. We show that FcμR is mostly stored inside the cell and that surface expression is tightly regulated. Decreased surface expression on T cells from elderly individuals is associated with alterations in the methylation pattern of the FCMR gene. Binding and internalization of IgM stimulate transport of FcμR to the cell surface to ensure sustained IgM uptake. Concurrently, IgM accumulates within the cell, and the surface expression of other receptors increases, among them the T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory molecules. This leads to enhanced TCR signaling, proliferation, and cytokine release, in response to low, but not high, doses of antigen. Our findings indicate that FcμR is an important regulator of T cell function and reveal an additional mode of interaction between B and T cells.

Abstract: Summary
Microbes must ensure robust amino acid metabolism in the face of external and internal perturbations. This robustness is thought to emerge from regulatory interactions in metabolic and genetic networks. Here, we explored the consequences of removing allosteric feedback inhibition in seven amino acid biosynthesis pathways in Escherichia coli (arginine, histidine, tryptophan, leucine, isoleucine, threonine, and proline). Proteome data revealed that enzyme levels decreased in five of the seven dysregulated pathways. Despite that, flux through the dysregulated pathways was not limited, indicating that enzyme levels are higher than absolutely needed in wild-type cells. We showed that such enzyme overabundance renders the arginine, histidine, and tryptophan pathways robust against perturbations of gene expression, using a metabolic model and CRISPR interference experiments. The results suggested a sensitive interaction between allosteric feedback inhibition and enzyme-level regulation that ensures robust yet efficient biosynthesis of histidine, arginine, and tryptophan in E. coli.

Abstract: Summary
During mitosis, motor proteins associate with microtubules to exert pushing forces that establish a mitotic spindle. These pushing forces generate opposing tension in the chromatin that connects oppositely attached sister chromatids, which may then act as a mechanical signal to ensure the fidelity of chromosome segregation during mitosis. However, the role of tension in mitotic cellular signaling remains controversial. In this study, we generated a gradient in tension over multiple isogenic budding yeast cell lines by genetically altering the magnitude of motor-based spindle forces. We found that a decreasing gradient in tension led to an increasing gradient in the rates of kinetochore detachment and anaphase chromosome mis-segregration, and in metaphase time. Simulations and experiments indicated that these tension responses originate from a tension-dependent kinetochore phosphorylation gradient. We conclude that the cell is exquisitely tuned to the magnitude of tension as a signal to detect potential chromosome segregation errors during mitosis.

Abstract: Summary
Regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by bone marrow (BM) niches has been extensively studied; however, whether and how HSC subpopulations are distinctively regulated by BM niches remain unclear. Here, we functionally distinguished reserve HSCs (rHSCs) from primed HSCs (pHSCs) based on their response to chemotherapy and examined how they are dichotomously regulated by BM niches. Both pHSCs and rHSCs supported long-term hematopoiesis in homeostasis; however, pHSCs were sensitive but rHSCs were resistant to chemotherapy. Surviving rHSCs restored the HSC pool and supported hematopoietic regeneration after chemotherapy. The rHSCs were preferentially maintained in the endosteal region that enriches N-cadherin+ (N-cad+) bone-lining cells in homeostasis and post-chemotherapy. N-cad+ cells were functional bone and marrow stromal progenitor cells (BMSPCs), giving rise to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro and in vivo. Finally, ablation of N-cad+ niche cells or deletion of SCF from N-cad+ niche cells impaired rHSC maintenance during homeostasis and regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
An insufficient adaptive beta-cell compensation is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Primary cilia function as versatile sensory antennae regulating various cellular processes, but their role on compensatory beta-cell replication has not been examined. Here, we identify a significant enrichment of downregulated, cilia-annotated genes in pancreatic islets of diabetes-prone NZO mice as compared with diabetes-resistant B6-ob/ob mice. Among 327 differentially expressed mouse cilia genes, 81 human orthologs are also affected in islets of diabetic donors. Islets of nondiabetic mice and humans show a substantial overlap of upregulated cilia genes that are linked to cell-cycle progression. The shRNA-mediated suppression of KIF3A, essential for ciliogenesis, impairs division of MIN6 beta cells as well as in dispersed primary mouse and human islet cells, as shown by decreased BrdU incorporation. These findings demonstrate the substantial role of cilia-gene regulation on islet function and T2D risk.

Abstract: Summary
Arc is a synaptic protein essential for memory consolidation. Recent studies indicate that Arc originates in evolution from a Ty3-Gypsy retrotransposon GAG domain. The N-lobe of Arc GAG domain acquired a hydrophobic binding pocket in higher vertebrates that is essential for Arc’s canonical function to weaken excitatory synapses. Here, we report that Arc GAG also acquired phosphorylation sites that can acutely regulate its synaptic function. CaMKII phosphorylates the N-lobe of the Arc GAG domain and disrupts an interaction surface essential for high-order oligomerization. In Purkinje neurons, CaMKII phosphorylation acutely reverses Arc’s synaptic action. Mutant Arc that cannot be phosphorylated by CaMKII enhances metabotropic receptor-dependent depression in the hippocampus but does not alter baseline synaptic transmission or long-term potentiation. Behavioral studies indicate that hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent learning requires Arc GAG domain phosphorylation. These studies provide an atomic model for dynamic and local control of Arc function underlying synaptic plasticity and memory.

Abstract: Summary
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) produces mRNA isoforms with different 3′ UTR lengths. Previous studies indicated that 3′ end processing and mRNA export are intertwined in gene regulation. Here, we show that mRNA export factors generally facilitate usage of distal cleavage and polyadenylation sites (PASs), leading to long 3′ UTR isoform expression. By focusing on the export receptor NXF1, which exhibits the most potent effect on APA in this study, we reveal several gene features that impact NXF1-dependent APA, including 3′ UTR size, gene size, and AT content. Surprisingly, NXF1 downregulation results in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) accumulation at the 3′ end of genes, correlating with its role in APA regulation. Moreover, NXF1 cooperates with CFI-68 to facilitate nuclear export of long 3′ UTR isoform with UGUA motifs. Together, our work reveals important roles of NXF1 in coordinating transcriptional dynamics, 3′ end processing, and nuclear export of long 3′ UTR transcripts, implicating NXF1 as a nexus of gene regulation.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic and biochemical defects of mitochondrial function are a major cause of human disease, but their link to mitochondrial morphology in situ has not been defined. Here, we develop a quantitative three-dimensional approach to map mitochondrial network organization in human muscle at electron microscopy resolution. We establish morphological differences between human and mouse and among patients with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diseases compared to healthy controls. We also define the ultrastructure and prevalence of mitochondrial nanotunnels, which exist as either free-ended or connecting membrane protrusions across non-adjacent mitochondria. A multivariate model integrating mitochondrial volume, morphological complexity, and branching anisotropy computed across individual mitochondria and mitochondrial populations identifies increased proportion of simple mitochondria and nanotunnels as a discriminant signature of mitochondrial stress. Overall, these data define the nature of the mitochondrial network in human muscle, quantify human-mouse differences, and suggest potential morphological markers of mitochondrial dysfunction in human tissues.

Abstract: Summary
Metabolic plasticity has been linked to polarized macrophage function, but mechanisms connecting specific fuels to tissue macrophage function remain unresolved. Here we apply a stable isotope tracing, mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics approach to reveal the metabolome penetrated by hepatocyte-derived glucose and ketone bodies. In both classically and alternatively polarized macrophages, [13C]acetoacetate (AcAc) labeled ∼200 chemical features, but its reduced form D-[13C]β-hydroxybutyrate (D-βOHB) labeled almost none. [13C]glucose labeled ∼500 features, and while unlabeled AcAc competed with only ∼15% of them, the vast majority required the mitochondrial enzyme succinyl-coenzyme A-oxoacid transferase (SCOT). AcAc carbon labeled metabolites within the cytoplasmic glycosaminoglycan pathway, which regulates tissue fibrogenesis. Accordingly, livers of mice lacking SCOT in macrophages were predisposed to accelerated fibrogenesis. Exogenous AcAc, but not D-βOHB, ameliorated diet-induced hepatic fibrosis. These data support a hepatocyte-macrophage ketone shuttle that segregates AcAc from D-βOHB, coordinating the fibrogenic response to hepatic injury via mitochondrial metabolism in tissue macrophages.

Abstract: Summary
Little information is available about how post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate the aging process. Here, we show that the RNA-binding protein Pumilio2 (PUM2), which is a translation repressor, is induced upon aging and acts as a negative regulator of lifespan and mitochondrial homeostasis. Multi-omics and cross-species analyses of PUM2 function show that it inhibits the translation of the mRNA encoding for the mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), thereby impairing mitochondrial fission and mitophagy. This mechanism is conserved in C. elegans by the PUM2 ortholog PUF-8. puf-8 knock-down in old nematodes and Pum2 CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout in the muscles of elderly mice enhances mitochondrial fission and mitophagy in both models, hence improving mitochondrial quality control and tissue homeostasis. Our data reveal how a PUM2-mediated layer of post-transcriptional regulation links altered Mff translation to mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy, thereby mediating age-related mitochondrial dysfunctions.

Abstract: Varicocele is one of the most prevalent causes of infertility. It causes induction of oxidative stress, increases lipid peroxidation in the testis and disrupts spermatogenesis cycle. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible protective effects of royal jelly against varicocele induced oxidative stress, biochemical and histological alterations in the experimental varicocele model in rat. Twenty-one adult Wistar rats were divided into three groups. The control group (I), Varicocele and administration of normal saline (II), varicocele and treatment with RJ (III). At the end of the experiment, all the animals were sacrificed and testes excised. The activity of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and MDA levels were measured. Also, histopathological examinations, Johnsen scores and sperm parameters were determined. There was a significant (p<0.05) increase in the activity level of CAT (0.223±0.005), SOD (0.177±0.0062), GPx (9.575±0.318) and a significant (p<0.05) reduction in the MDA level (2.674±0.336) of the experimental varicocele treated with royal jelly when compared to the activity of CAT (0.011±0.004), SOD (0.035±0.0096), GPx (8.864±0.397) and MDA level (4.630±0.579) of the experimental varicocele and administration of normal saline. Results of the Johnsen score showed a significant increase (p<0.05) in the mean score of the RJ group (7.94±1.5) when compared to the normal saline group (6.04±1.4). Therefore, RJ is a potential area for further studies and improving in spermatogenesis cycle after varicocele.

Abstract: Summary
We comprehensively analyzed clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic data of a cohort of 465 primary triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). PIK3CA mutations and copy-number gains of chromosome 22q11 were more frequent in our Chinese cohort than in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We classified TNBCs into four transcriptome-based subtypes: (1) luminal androgen receptor (LAR), (2) immunomodulatory, (3) basal-like immune-suppressed, and (4) mesenchymal-like. Putative therapeutic targets or biomarkers were identified among each subtype. Importantly, the LAR subtype showed more ERBB2 somatic mutations, infrequent mutational signature 3 and frequent CDKN2A loss. The comprehensive profile of TNBCs provided here will serve as a reference to further advance the understanding and precision treatment of TNBC.

Abstract: Summary
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcription termination at protein-coding genes is coupled to the cleavage of the nascent transcript, whereas most non-coding RNA transcription relies on a cleavage-independent termination pathway involving Nrd1, Nab3, and Sen1 (NNS). Termination involves RNA polymerase II CTD phosphorylation, but a systematic analysis of the contribution of individual residues would improve our understanding of the role of the CTD in this process. Here we investigated the effect of mutating phosphorylation sites in the CTD on termination. We observed widespread termination defects at protein-coding genes in mutants for Ser2 or Thr4 but rare defects in Tyr1 mutants for this genes class. Instead, mutating Tyr1 led to widespread termination defects at non-coding genes terminating via NNS. Finally, we showed that Tyr1 is important for pausing in the 5′ end of genes and that slowing down transcription suppresses termination defects. Our work highlights the importance of Tyr1-mediated pausing in NNS-dependent termination.

Abstract: Bacterial α-type carbonic anhydrase (α-CA) is a zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reversible and extremely rapid interconversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate. In this study, we report the first crystal structure of a hyperthermostable α-CA from Persephonella marina EX-H1 (pmCA) in the absence and presence of competitive inhibitor, acetazolamide. The structure reveals a compactly folded pmCA homodimer in which each monomer consists of a 10-stranded β-sheet in the center. The catalytic zinc ion is coordinated by three highly conserved histidine residues with an exchangeable fourth ligand (a water molecule, a bicarbonate anion, or the sulfonamide group of acetazolamide). Together with an intramolecular disulfide bond, extensive interfacial networks of hydrogen bonds, ionic and hydrophobic interactions stabilize the dimeric structure and are likely responsible for the high thermal stability. We also identified novel binding sites for calcium ions at the crystallographic interface, which serve as molecular glue linking negatively charged and otherwise repulsive surfaces. Furthermore, this large negatively charged patch appears to further increase the thermostability at alkaline pH range via favorable charge-charge interactions between pmCA and solvent molecules. These findings may assist development of novel α-CAs with improved thermal and/or alkaline stability for applications such as CO2 capture and sequestration.

Abstract: Summary
We report proteogenomic analysis of diffuse gastric cancers (GCs) in young populations. Phosphoproteome data elucidated signaling pathways associated with somatic mutations based on mutation-phosphorylation correlations. Moreover, correlations between mRNA and protein abundances provided potential oncogenes and tumor suppressors associated with patient survival. Furthermore, integrated clustering of mRNA, protein, phosphorylation, and N-glycosylation data identified four subtypes of diffuse GCs. Distinguishing these subtypes was possible by proteomic data. Four subtypes were associated with proliferation, immune response, metabolism, and invasion, respectively; and associations of the subtypes with immune- and invasion-related pathways were identified mainly by phosphorylation and N-glycosylation data. Therefore, our proteogenomic analysis provides additional information beyond genomic analyses, which can improve understanding of cancer biology and patient stratification in diffuse GCs.

Abstract: Summary
Caenorhabditis elegans provides an amenable system to explore whether newly composed ribosomes are required to progress through development. Despite the complex pattern of tissues that are formed during embryonic development, we found that null homozygotes lacking any of the five different ribosomal proteins (RPs) can produce fully functional first-stage larvae, with similar developmental competence seen upon complete deletion of the multi-copy ribosomal RNA locus. These animals, relying on maternal but not zygotic contribution of ribosomal components, are capable of completing embryogenesis. In the absence of new ribosomal components, the resulting animals are arrested before progression from the first larval stage and fail in two assays for postembryonic plasticity of neuronal structure. Mosaic analyses of larvae that are a mixture of ribosome-competent and non-competent cells suggest a global regulatory mechanism in which ribosomal insufficiency in a subset of cells triggers organism-wide growth arrest.

Abstract: Summary
Since its establishment in 2009, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been a major driver behind progress in biomedical research. In developmental biology and stem cell studies, the ability to profile single cells confers particular benefits. Although most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed. Here, with the same cell line and bioinformatics pipeline, we developed directly comparable datasets for each of three widely used droplet-based ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems, inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10X Genomics Chromium. Although each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system.

Abstract: Summary
The chromatin-associated protein WDR5 is a promising target for pharmacological inhibition in cancer. Drug discovery efforts center on the blockade of the “WIN site” of WDR5, a well-defined pocket that is amenable to small molecule inhibition. Various cancer contexts have been proposed to be targets for WIN site inhibitors, but a lack of understanding of WDR5 target genes and of the primary effects of WIN site inhibitors hampers their utility. Here, by the discovery of potent WIN site inhibitors, we demonstrate that the WIN site links WDR5 to chromatin at a small cohort of loci, including a specific subset of ribosome protein genes. WIN site inhibitors rapidly displace WDR5 from chromatin and decrease the expression of associated genes, causing translational inhibition, nucleolar stress, and p53 induction. Our studies define a mode by which WDR5 engages chromatin and forecast that WIN site blockade could have utility against multiple cancer types.

Abstract: Summary
Zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (Zeb1) is a key regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis. Mutation of ZEB1 is associated with human diseases and defective brain development. Here we show that downregulation of Zeb1 expression in embryonic cortical neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is necessary for proper neuronal differentiation and migration. Overexpression of Zeb1 during neuronal differentiation, when its expression normally declines, blocks NPC lineage progression and disrupts multipolar-to-bipolar transition of differentiating neurons, leading to severe migration defects and subcortical heterotopia bands at postnatal stages. ZEB1 regulates a cohort of genes involved in cell differentiation and migration, including Neurod1 and Pard6b. The interaction between ZEB1 and CTBP2 in the embryonic cerebral cortex is required for ZEB1 to elicit its effect on the multipolar-to-bipolar transition, but not its suppression of Neurod1. These findings provide insights into understanding the complexity of transcriptional regulation during neuronal differentiation.

Abstract: Summary
The greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, degrades wax and plastic molecules. Despite much interest, the genetic basis of these hallmark traits remains poorly understood. Herein, we assembled high-quality genome and transcriptome data from G. mellonella to investigate long-chain hydrocarbon wax metabolism strategies. Specific carboxylesterase and lipase and fatty-acid-metabolism-related enzymes in the G. mellonella genome are transcriptionally regulated during feeding on beeswax. Strikingly, G. mellonella lacking intestinal microbiota successfully decomposes long-chain fatty acids following wax metabolism, although the intestinal microbiome performs a supplementary role in short-chain fatty acid degradation. Notably, final wax derivatives were detected by gas chromatography even in the absence of gut microbiota. Our findings provide insight into wax moth adaptation and may assist in the development of unique wax-degradation strategies with a similar metabolic approach for a plastic molecule polyethylene biodegradation using organisms without intestinal microbiota.

Abstract: Summary
Proximity-dependent biotin labeling (BioID) may identify new targets for cancers driven by difficult-to-drug oncogenes such as Ras. Therefore, BioID was used with wild-type (WT) and oncogenic mutant (MT) H-, K-, and N-Ras, identifying known interactors, including Raf and PI3K, as well as a common set of 130 novel proteins proximal to all Ras isoforms. A CRISPR screen of these proteins for Ras dependence identified mTOR, which was also found proximal to MT Ras in human tumors. Oncogenic Ras directly bound two mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) components, mTOR and MAPKAP1, to promote mTORC2 kinase activity at the plasma membrane. mTORC2 enabled the Ras pro-proliferative cell cycle transcriptional program, and perturbing the Ras-mTORC2 interaction impaired Ras-dependent neoplasia in vivo. Combining proximity-dependent proteomics with CRISPR screening identified a new set of functional Ras-associated proteins, defined mTORC2 as a new direct Ras effector, and offers a strategy for finding new proteins that cooperate with dominant oncogenes.

Abstract: Summary
The biosynthesis of coenzyme Q presents a paradigm for how cells surmount hydrophobic barriers in lipid biology. In eukaryotes, CoQ precursors—among nature’s most hydrophobic molecules—must somehow be presented to a series of enzymes peripherally associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we reveal that this process relies on custom lipid-binding properties of COQ9. We show that COQ9 repurposes the bacterial TetR fold to bind aromatic isoprenes with high specificity, including CoQ intermediates that likely reside entirely within the bilayer. We reveal a process by which COQ9 associates with cardiolipin-rich membranes and warps the membrane surface to access this cargo. Finally, we identify a molecular interface between COQ9 and the hydroxylase COQ7, motivating a model whereby COQ9 presents intermediates directly to CoQ enzymes. Overall, our results provide a mechanism for how a lipid-binding protein might access, select, and deliver specific cargo from a membrane to promote biosynthesis.

Abstract: Summary
Fatty acid uptake is the first step in fatty acid utilization, but it remains unclear how the process is regulated. Protein palmitoylation is a fatty acyl modification that plays a key regulatory role in protein targeting and trafficking; however, its function in regulating fatty acid metabolism is unknown. Here, we show that two of the Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif-containing palmitoyl acyltransferases, DHHC4 and DHHC5, regulate fatty acid uptake. DHHC4 and DHHC5 function at different subcellular localizations to control the palmitoylation, plasma membrane localization, and fatty acid uptake activity of the scavenger receptor CD36. Depletion of either DHHC4 or DHHC5 in cells disrupts CD36-dependent fatty acid uptake. Furthermore, both Dhhc4−/− and adipose-specific Dhhc5 knockout mice show decreased fatty acid uptake activity in adipose tissues and develop severe hypothermia upon acute cold exposure. These findings demonstrate a critical role of DHHC4 and DHHC5 in regulating fatty acid uptake.

Abstract: Summary
EndoC-βH1 is emerging as a critical human β cell model to study the genetic and environmental etiologies of β cell (dys)function and diabetes. Comprehensive knowledge of its molecular landscape is lacking, yet required, for effective use of this model. Here, we report chromosomal (spectral karyotyping), genetic (genotyping), epigenomic (ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq), chromatin interaction (Hi-C and Pol2 ChIA-PET), and transcriptomic (RNA-seq and miRNA-seq) maps of EndoC-βH1. Analyses of these maps define known (e.g., PDX1 and ISL1) and putative (e.g., PCSK1 and mir-375) β cell-specific transcriptional cis-regulatory networks and identify allelic effects on cis-regulatory element use. Importantly, comparison with maps generated in primary human islets and/or β cells indicates preservation of chromatin looping but also highlights chromosomal aberrations and fetal genomic signatures in EndoC-βH1. Together, these maps, and a web application we created for their exploration, provide important tools for the design of experiments to probe and manipulate the genetic programs governing β cell identity and (dys)function in diabetes.

Abstract: Summary
During the trunk-to-tail transition, axial progenitors relocate from the epiblast to the tail bud. Here, we show that this process entails a major regulatory switch, bringing tail bud progenitors under Gdf11 signaling control. Gdf11 mutant embryos have an increased number of such progenitors that favor neural differentiation routes, resulting in a dramatic expansion of the neural tube. Moreover, inhibition of Gdf11 signaling recovers the proliferation ability of these progenitors when cultured in vitro. Tail bud progenitor growth is independent of Oct4, relying instead on Lin28 activity. Gdf11 signaling eventually activates Hox genes of paralog group 13, which halt expansion of these progenitors, at least in part, by down-regulating Lin28 genes. Our results uncover a genetic network involving Gdf11, Lin28, and Hox13 genes controlling axial progenitor activity in the tail bud.

Abstract: The maintenance of mitochondrial function is closely linked to the control of senescence. In our previous study, we uncovered a novel mechanism in which senescence amelioration in normal aging cells is mediated by the recovered mitochondrial function upon Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibition. However, it remains elusive whether this mechanism is also applicable to senescence amelioration in accelerated aging cells. In this study, we examined the role of ATM inhibition on mitochondrial function in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and Werner syndrome (WS) cells. We found that ATM inhibition induced mitochondrial functional recovery accompanied by metabolic reprogramming, which has been known to be a prerequisite for senescence alleviation in normal aging cells. Indeed, the induced mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming was coupled with senescence amelioration in accelerated aging cells. Furthermore, the therapeutic effect via ATM inhibition was observed in HGPS as evidenced by reduced progerin accumulation with concomitant decrease of abnormal nuclear morphology. Taken together, our data indicate that the mitochondrial functional recovery by ATM inhibition might represent a promising strategy to ameliorate the accelerated aging phenotypes and to treat age-related disease.

Abstract: Limited self-restorative ability of the cartilage has necessitated the use of cell and tissue engineering based therapies. Recent advances in the isolation, expansion and characterization of articular cartilage derived chondroprogenitors(CPs) has gained popularity in its role for cartilage repair. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a reliable biological scaffold for in-vitro and in-vivo studies with reported therapeutic applications in cartilage and bone pathologies. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether human allogeneic PRP could serve as a biological scaffold for chondroprogenitors (CPs) in cartilage repair. CPs were isolated from the superficial layer of three osteoarthritic knee joints by fibronectin adhesion assay and characterized using flow cytometric analysis. Allogeneic citrated blood was harvested from three subjects to obtain PRP. CPs at a concentration of one million cells per ml were gelled with PRP using calcium chloride. The PRP-CP scaffolds were subjected for adipogeneic, osteogenic, chondrogeneic differentiation and processed for post differentiation-staining studies (Oil Red O, Von Kossa, Alcian blue staining), immunofluorescence (collagen II) and live dead assays (Calcein AM-Ethidium Homodimer). We show that PRP was able to sustain CP cell viability and differentiate towards adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineage under appropriate culture conditions. We also noted positive extracellular matrix production in PRP-CP scaffolds cultured without chondrogenic supplementation. Our results suggest that PRP could be a promising bio-active scaffold due to its synergistic effect in supporting cell proliferation, maintaining cell viability and favoring extracellular matrix production. PRP can be used as biological scaffold for the delivery of CPs in cartilage healing.

Abstract: Summary
Excessive levels of saturated fatty acids are toxic to cells, although the basis for this lipotoxicity remains incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome, lipidome, and genetic interactions of human leukemia cells exposed to palmitate. Palmitate treatment increased saturated glycerolipids, accompanied by a transcriptional stress response, including upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. A comprehensive genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen identified >350 genes modulating lipotoxicity. Among previously unknown genetic modifiers of lipotoxicity, depletion of RNF213, a putative ubiquitin ligase mutated in Moyamoya vascular disease, protected cells from lipotoxicity. On a broader level, integration of our comprehensive datasets revealed that changes in di-saturated glycerolipids, but not other lipid classes, are central to lipotoxicity in this model. Consistent with this, inhibition of ER-localized glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity protected from all aspects of lipotoxicity. Identification of genes modulating the response to saturated fatty acids may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for treating metabolic diseases linked to lipotoxicity.

Abstract: Summary
Information transfer across CNS synapses depends on the very low basal vesicle fusion rate and the ability to rapidly upregulate that rate upon Ca2+ influx. We show that local electrostatic repulsion participates in creating an energy barrier, which limits spontaneous synaptic transmission. The barrier amplitude is increased by negative charges and decreased by positive charges on the SNARE-complex surface. Strikingly, the effect of charges on the barrier is additive and this extends to evoked transmission, but with a shallower charge dependence. Action potential-driven synaptic release is equivalent to the abrupt addition of ∼35 positive charges to the fusion machine. Within an electrostatic model for triggering, the Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-1 contributes ∼18 charges by binding Ca2+, while also modulating the fusion barrier at rest. Thus, the energy barrier for synaptic vesicle fusion has a large electrostatic component, allowing synaptotagmin-1 to act as an electrostatic switch and modulator to trigger vesicle fusion.

Abstract: Summary
Cytosolic DNA activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), an innate immune sensor pivotal in anti-microbial defense, senescence, auto-immunity, and cancer. cGAS is considered to be a sequence-independent DNA sensor with limited access to nuclear DNA because of compartmentalization. However, the nuclear envelope is a dynamic barrier, and cGAS is present in the nucleus. Here, we identify determinants of nuclear cGAS localization and activation. We show that nuclear-localized cGAS synthesizes cGAMP and induces innate immune activation of dendritic cells, although cGAMP levels are 200-fold lower than following transfection with exogenous DNA. Using cGAS ChIP-seq and a GFP-cGAS knockin mouse, we find nuclear cGAS enrichment on centromeric satellite DNA, confirmed by imaging, and to a lesser extent on LINE elements. The non-enzymatic N-terminal domain of cGAS determines nucleo-cytoplasmic localization, enrichment on centromeres, and activation of nuclear-localized cGAS. These results reveal a preferential functional association of nuclear cGAS with centromeres.

Abstract: Summary
Gut mesenchyme provides key stem cell niche signals such as Wnt ligands, but how these signals are regulated is unclear. Because Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is critical for gut mesenchymal development and tumorigenesis, we investigated Hh-mediated mechanisms by analyzing mice deleted for key negative regulators of Hh signaling, Sufu and/or Spop, in the gut mesenchyme, and demonstrated their dosage-dependent roles. Although these mutants exhibit abnormal mesenchymal cell growth and functionally defective muscle layers, villification is completed with proper mesenchymal clustering, implying a permissive role for Hh signaling. These mesenchymal defects are partially rescued by Gli2 reduction. Consistent with increased epithelial proliferation caused by abnormal Hh activation in development, Sufu reduction promotes intestinal tumorigenesis, whereas Gli2 heterozygosity suppresses it. Our analyses of chromatin and GLI2 binding genomic regions reveal its transcriptional regulation of stem cell niche signals through enhancers, providing mechanistic insight into the intestinal stem cell niche in development and tumorigenesis.

Abstract: Summary
A key challenge for the diagnosis and treatment of complex human diseases is identifying their molecular basis. Here, we developed a unified computational framework, URSAHD (Unveiling RNA Sample Annotation for Human Diseases), that leverages machine learning and the hierarchy of anatomical relationships present among diseases to integrate thousands of clinical gene expression profiles and identify molecular characteristics specific to each of the hundreds of complex diseases. URSAHD can distinguish between closely related diseases more accurately than literature-validated genes or traditional differential-expression-based computational approaches and is applicable to any disease, including rare and understudied ones. We demonstrate the utility of URSAHD in classifying related nervous system cancers and experimentally verifying novel neuroblastoma-associated genes identified by URSAHD. We highlight the applications for potential targeted drug-repurposing and for quantitatively assessing the molecular response to clinical therapies. URSAHD is freely available for public use, including the use of underlying models, at ursahd.princeton.edu.

Abstract: Summary
The heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is upregulated in response to stress and has been implicated as a stress marker in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, whether Hsp70 plays a pathologic or protective role in TLE remains unclear. Here we report a deleterious role of Hsp70 in kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. Hsp70 expression is upregulated in a KA model of TLE, and silencing or inhibition of Hsp70 suppresses neuronal hyperexcitability and attenuates acute or chronic epilepsy by enhancing A-type potassium current in hippocampal neurons. Hsp70 upregulation leads to proteosomal degradation of Kv4-KChIP4a channel complexes primarily encoding neuronal A-type current. Furthermore, Hsp70 directly binds to the N terminus of auxiliary KChIP4a and targets Kv4-KChIP4a complexes to proteasome. Taken together, our findings reveal a role of Hsp70 in the pathogenesis of epilepsy through degradation of Kv4-KChIP4a complexes, and pharmacological inhibition of Hsp70 may represent therapeutic potential for epilepsy or hyperexcitability-related neurological disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Dermal γδT cells play critical roles in skin homeostasis and inflammation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which these cells are activated have not been fully understood. Here, we show that the mechanistic or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and STAT3 pathways are activated in dermal γδT cells in response to innate stimuli such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-23. Although both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 are essential for dermal γδT cell proliferation, mTORC2 deficiency leads to decreased dermal γδT17 cells. It appears that mitochondria-mediated oxidative phosphorylation is critical in this process. Notably, although the STAT3 pathway is critical for dermal Vγ4T17 effector function, it is not required for Vγ6T17 cells. Transcription factor IRF-4 activation promotes dermal γδT cell IL-17 production by linking IL-1β and IL-23 signaling. The absence of mTORC2 in dermal γδT cells, but not STAT3, ameliorates skin inflammation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the mTOR-STAT3 signaling differentially regulates dermal γδT cell effector function in skin inflammation.
