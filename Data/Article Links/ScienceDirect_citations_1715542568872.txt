Abstract: Summary
Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-mediated adaptive resistance is one major barrier to improving immunotherapy in solid tumors. However, the mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we report that IFN-γ promotes nuclear translocation and phase separation of YAP after anti-PD-1 therapy in tumor cells. Hydrophobic interactions of the YAP coiled-coil domain mediate droplet initiation, and weak interactions of the intrinsically disordered region in the C terminus promote droplet formation. YAP partitions with the transcription factor TEAD4, the histone acetyltransferase EP300, and Mediator1 and forms transcriptional hubs for maximizing target gene transcriptions, independent of the canonical STAT1-IRF1 transcription program. Disruption of YAP phase separation reduced tumor growth, enhanced immune response, and sensitized tumor cells to anti-PD-1 therapy. YAP activity is negatively correlated with patient outcome. Our study indicates that YAP mediates the IFN-γ pro-tumor effect through its nuclear phase separation and suggests that YAP can be used as a predictive biomarker and target of anti-PD-1 combination therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) trauma interrupts neural networks and, because axonal regeneration is minimal, neurological deficits persist. Repair via axonal growth is limited by extracellular inhibitors and cell-autonomous factors. Based on results from a screen in vitro, we evaluate nearly 400 genes through a large-scale in vivo regeneration screen. Suppression of 40 genes using viral-driven short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) promotes retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon regeneration after optic nerve crush (ONC), and most are validated by separate CRISPR-Cas9 editing experiments. Expression of these axon-regeneration-suppressing genes is not significantly altered by axotomy. Among regeneration-limiting genes, loss of the interleukin 22 (IL-22) cytokine allows an early, yet transient, inflammatory response in the retina after injury. Reduced IL-22 drives concurrent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) and dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) pathways and upregulation of multiple neuron-intrinsic regeneration-associated genes (RAGs). Including IL-22, our screen identifies dozens of genes that limit CNS regeneration. Suppression of these genes in the context of axonal damage could support improved neural repair.

Abstract: Summary
Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase belonging to the RING-between-RING family. Mutations in the Parkin-encoding gene PARK2 are associated with familial Parkinson’s disease. Here, we investigate the interplay between Parkin and the inflammatory cytokine-induced ubiquitin-like modifier FAT10. FAT10 targets hundreds of proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. We show that FAT10 gets conjugated to Parkin and mediates its degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Parkin binds to the E2 enzyme of FAT10 (USE1), auto-FAT10ylates itself, and facilitates FAT10ylation of the Parkin substrate Mitofusin2 in vitro and in cells, thus identifying Parkin as a FAT10 E3 ligase. On mitochondrial depolarization, FAT10ylation of Parkin inhibits its activation and ubiquitin-ligase activity causing impairment of mitophagy progression and aggravation of rotenone-mediated death of dopaminergic neuronal cells. In conclusion, FAT10ylation inhibits Parkin and mitophagy rendering FAT10 a likely inflammation-induced exacerbating factor and potential drug target for Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Summary
The human fallopian tube harbors the cell of origin for the majority of high-grade serous “ovarian” cancers (HGSCs), but its cellular composition, particularly the epithelial component, is poorly characterized. We perform single-cell transcriptomic profiling of around 53,000 individual cells from 12 primary fallopian specimens to map their major cell types. We identify 10 epithelial subpopulations with diverse transcriptional programs. Based on transcriptional signatures, we reconstruct a trajectory whereby secretory cells differentiate into ciliated cells via a RUNX3high intermediate. Computational deconvolution of advanced HGSCs identifies the “early secretory” population as a likely precursor state for the majority of HGSCs. Its signature comprises both epithelial and mesenchymal features and is enriched in mesenchymal-type HGSCs (p = 6.7 × 10−27), a group known to have particularly poor prognoses. This cellular and molecular compendium of the human fallopian tube in cancer-free women is expected to advance our understanding of the earliest stages of fallopian epithelial neoplasia.

Abstract: Summary
Transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is coupled to pre-mRNA splicing, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Co-transcriptional splicing requires assembly of a functional spliceosome on nascent pre-mRNA, but whether and how this influences Pol II transcription remains unclear. Here we show that inhibition of pre-mRNA branch site recognition by the spliceosome component U2 snRNP leads to a widespread and strong decrease in new RNA synthesis from human genes. Multiomics analysis reveals that inhibition of U2 snRNP function increases the duration of Pol II pausing in the promoter-proximal region, impairs recruitment of the pause release factor P-TEFb, and reduces Pol II elongation velocity at the beginning of genes. Our results indicate that efficient release of paused Pol II into active transcription elongation requires the formation of functional spliceosomes and that eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis relies on positive feedback from the splicing machinery to the transcription machinery.

Abstract: Summary
Histone variants (HVs) are a subfamily of epigenetic regulators implicated in embryonic development, but their role in human stem cell fate remains unclear. Here, we reveal that the phosphorylation state of the HV H2A.X (γH2A.X) regulates self-renewal and differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and leukemic progenitors. As demonstrated by CRISPR-Cas deletion, H2A.X is essential in maintaining normal hPSC behavior. However, reduced levels of γH2A.X enhances hPSC differentiation toward the hematopoietic lineage with concomitant inhibition of neural development. In contrast, activation and sustained levels of phosphorylated H2A.X enhance hPSC neural fate while suppressing hematopoiesis. This controlled lineage bias correlates to occupancy of γH2A.X at genomic loci associated with ectoderm versus mesoderm specification. Finally, drug modulation of H2A.X phosphorylation overcomes differentiation block of patient-derived leukemic progenitors. Our study demonstrates HVs may serve to regulate pluripotent cell fate and that this biology could be extended to somatic cancer stem cell control.

Abstract: Summary
Although neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against epitopes within the alphavirus E2 protein can protect against infection, the functional significance of non-neutralizing mAbs is poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the activity of 13 non-neutralizing mAbs against Mayaro virus (MAYV), an emerging arthritogenic alphavirus. These mAbs bind to the MAYV virion and surface of infected cells but fail to neutralize infection in cell culture. Mapping studies identify six mAb binding groups that localize to discrete epitopes within or adjacent to the A domain of the E2 glycoprotein. Remarkably, passive transfer of non-neutralizing mAbs protects against MAYV infection and disease in mice, and their efficacy requires Fc effector functions. Monocytes mediate the protection of non-neutralizing mAbs in vivo, as Fcγ-receptor-expressing myeloid cells facilitate the binding, uptake, and clearance of MAYV without antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Humoral protection against alphaviruses likely reflects contributions from non-neutralizing antibodies through Fc-dependent mechanisms that accelerate viral clearance.

Abstract: Summary
The assembly pathways of mitochondrial respirasome (supercomplex I+III2+IV) are not fully understood. Here, we show that an early sub-complex I assembly, rather than holo-complex I, is sufficient to initiate mitochondrial respirasome assembly. We find that a distal part of the membrane arm of complex I (PD-a module) is a scaffold for the incorporation of complexes III and IV to form a respirasome subcomplex. Depletion of PD-a, rather than other complex I modules, decreases the steady-state levels of complexes III and IV. Both HEK293T cells lacking TIMMDC1 and patient-derived cells with disease-causing mutations in TIMMDC1 showed accumulation of this respirasome subcomplex. This suggests that TIMMDC1, previously known as a complex-I assembly factor, may function as a respirasome assembly factor. Collectively, we provide a detailed, cooperative assembly model in which most complex-I subunits are added to the respirasome subcomplex in the lateral stages of respirasome assembly.

Abstract: Summary
Exploitation of naturally occurring genetic mutations could empower the discovery of novel aspects of established cancer genes. We report here that TRPS1, a gene linked to the tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome (TRPS) and recently identified as a potential breast cancer driver, promotes breast carcinogenesis through regulating replication. Epigenomic decomposition of TRPS1 landscape reveals nearly half of H3K9me3-marked heterochromatic origins are occupied by TRPS1, where it encourages the chromatin loading of APC/C, resulting in uncontrolled origin refiring. TRPS1 binds to the genome through its atypical H3K9me3 reading via GATA and IKAROS domains, while TRPS-related mutations affect its chromatin binding, replication boosting, and tumorigenicity. Concordantly, overexpression of wild-type but not TRPS-associated mutants of TRPS1 is sufficient to drive cancer genome amplifications, which experience an extrachromosomal route and dynamically evolve to confer therapeutic resistance. Together, these results uncover a critical function of TRPS1 in driving heterochromatin origin firing and breast cancer genome evolution.

Abstract: Vascular smooth muscle cells are unusual in that differentiated, contractile cells possess the capacity to “de-differentiate” into a synthetic phenotype that is characterized by being replicative, secretory, and migratory. One aspect of this phenotypic modulation is a shift from voltage-gated Ca2+ signalling in electrically coupled, differentiated cells to increased dependence on store-operated Ca2+ entry and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in synthetic cells. Conversely, an increased voltage-gated Ca2+ entry is seen when proliferating A7r5 smooth muscle cells quiesce. We asked whether this change in Ca2+ signalling was linked to changes in the expression of the phenotype-regulating transcriptional co-activator myocardin or α-smooth muscle actin, using correlative epifluorescence Ca2+ imaging and immunocytochemistry. Cells were cultured in growth media (DMEM, 10% serum, 25 mM glucose) or differentiation media (DMEM, 1% serum, 5 mM glucose). Coinciding with growth arrest, A7r5 cells became electrically coupled, and spontaneous Ca2+ signalling showed increasing dependence on L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that were blocked with nifedipine (5 μM). These synchronized oscillations were modulated by ryanodine receptors, based on their sensitivity to dantrolene (5 μM). Actively growing cultures had spontaneous Ca2+ transients that were insensitive to nifedipine and dantrolene but were blocked by inhibition of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase with cyclopiazonic acid (10 μM). In cells treated with differentiation media, myocardin and αSMA immunoreactivity increased prior to changes in the Ca2+ signalling phenotype, while chronic inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ entry modestly increased immunoreactivity of myocardin. Stepwise regression analyses suggested that changes in myocardin expression had a weak relationship with Ca2+ signalling synchronicity, but not frequency or amplitude. In conclusion, we report a 96-well assay and analytical pipeline to study the link between Ca2+ signalling and smooth muscle differentiation. This assay showed that changes in the expression of two molecular differentiation markers (myocardin and αSMA) tended to precede changes in the Ca2+ signalling phenotype.

Abstract: Summary
Alloimmune responses in acute rejection are complex, involving multiple interacting cell types and pathways. Deep profiling of these cell types has been limited by technology that lacks the capacity to resolve this high dimensionality. Single-cell mass cytometry is used to characterize the alloimmune response in early acute rejection, measuring 37 parameters simultaneously, across multiple time points in two models: a murine cardiac and vascularized composite allotransplant (VCA). Semi-supervised hierarchical clustering is used to group related cell types defined by combinatorial expression of surface and intracellular proteins, along with markers of effector function and activation. This expression profile is mapped to visualize changes in antigen composition across cell types, revealing phenotypic signatures in alloimmune T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and myeloid subsets that are conserved and that firmly distinguish rejecting from non-rejecting grafts. These data provide a comprehensive, high-dimensional profile of cellular rejection after allograft transplantation.

Abstract: Summary
Primary cilia are sensory organelles that utilize the compartmentalization of membrane and cytoplasm to communicate signaling events, and yet, how the formation of a cilium is coordinated with reorganization of the cortical membrane and cytoskeleton is unclear. Using polarized epithelia, we find that cortical actin clearing and apical membrane partitioning occur where the centrosome resides at the cell surface prior to ciliation. RAB19, a previously uncharacterized RAB, associates with the RAB-GAP TBC1D4 and the HOPS-tethering complex to coordinate cortical clearing and ciliary membrane growth, which is essential for ciliogenesis. This RAB19-directed pathway is not exclusive to polarized epithelia, as RAB19 loss in nonpolarized cell types blocks ciliogenesis with a docked ciliary vesicle. Remarkably, inhibiting actomyosin contractility can substitute for the function of the RAB19 complex and restore ciliogenesis in knockout cells. Together, this work provides a mechanistic understanding behind a cytoskeletal clearing and membrane partitioning step required for ciliogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
The DREAM complex orchestrates cell quiescence and the cell cycle. However, how the DREAM complex is deregulated in cancer remains elusive. Here, we report that PAF (PCLAF/KIAA0101) drives cell quiescence exit to promote lung tumorigenesis by remodeling the DREAM complex. PAF is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and is associated with poor prognosis. Importantly, Paf knockout markedly suppressed LUAD development in mouse models. PAF depletion induced LUAD cell quiescence and growth arrest. PAF is required for the global expression of cell-cycle genes controlled by the repressive DREAM complex. Mechanistically, PAF inhibits DREAM complex formation by binding to RBBP4, a core DREAM subunit, leading to transactivation of DREAM target genes. Furthermore, pharmacological mimicking of PAF-depleted transcriptomes inhibited LUAD tumor growth. Our results unveil how the PAF-remodeled DREAM complex bypasses cell quiescence to promote lung tumorigenesis and suggest that the PAF-DREAM axis may be a therapeutic vulnerability in lung cancer.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a severe neurological disorder defined by spontaneous seizures. Current treatment options fail in a large proportion of patients, while questions as to the basic mechanisms of seizure initiation and propagation remain. Advances in imaging of seizures in experimental model systems could lead to a better understanding of mechanisms of seizures and epilepsy. Recent studies have used two-photon calcium imaging (2 P imaging) in awake, behaving mice in head-fixed preparations to image seizures in vivo at high speed and cellular-level resolution to identify key seizure-related cell classes. Here, we discuss such advances and present 2 P imaging data of excitatory neurons and defined subsets of cerebral cortex GABAergic inhibitory interneurons during naturalistic seizures in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome (Scn1a+/- mice) along with other behavioral measures. Results demonstrate differential recruitment of discrete interneuron subclasses, which could inform mechanisms of seizure generation and propagation in Dravet syndrome and other epilepsies.

Abstract: The determinant factors of an organism’s size during animal development have been explored from various angles but remain partially understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, many genes affecting cuticle structure, cell growth, and proliferation have been identified to regulate the worm’s overall morphology, including body size. While various mutations in those genes directly result in changes in the morphological phenotypes, there is still a need for established, clear, and distinct standards to determine the apparent abnormality in a worm’s size and shape. In this study, we measured the body length, body width, terminal bulb length, and head size of mutant worms with reported Dumpy (Dpy), Small (Sma) or Long (Lon) phenotypes by plotting and comparing their respective ratios of various parameters. These results show that the Sma phenotypes are proportionally smaller overall with mild stoutness, and Dpy phenotypes are significantly stouter and have disproportionally small head size. This study provides a standard platform for determining morphological phenotypes designating and annotating mutants that exhibit body shape variations, defining the morphological phenotype of previously unexamined mutants.

Abstract: Summary
Developing oocytes need large supplies of macromolecules and organelles. A conserved strategy for accumulating these products is to pool resources of oocyte-associated germline nurse cells. In Drosophila, these cells grow more than 100-fold to boost their biosynthetic capacity. No previously known mechanism explains how nurse cells coordinate growth collectively. Here, we report a cell cycle-regulating mechanism that depends on bidirectional communication between the oocyte and nurse cells, revealing the oocyte as a critical regulator of germline cyst growth. Transcripts encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, Dacapo, are synthesized by the nurse cells and actively localized to the oocyte. Retrograde movement of the oocyte-synthesized Dacapo protein to the nurse cells generates a network of coupled oscillators that controls the cell cycle of the nurse cells to regulate cyst growth. We propose that bidirectional nurse cell-oocyte communication establishes a growth-sensing feedback mechanism that regulates the quantity of maternal resources loaded into the oocyte.

Abstract: Summary
The coactivator p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) regulates genes by facilitating the assembly of transcriptional machinery and by acetylating histones and other factors. However, it remains mostly unclear how both functions of p300 are dynamically coordinated during gene control. Here, we showed that p300 can orchestrate two functions through the formation of dynamic clusters with certain transcription factors (TFs), which is mediated by the interactions between a TF’s transactivation domain (TAD) and the intrinsically disordered regions of p300. Co-condensation can enable spatially defined, all-or-none activation of p300’s catalytic activity, priming the recruitment of coactivators, including Brd4. We showed that co-condensation can modulate transcriptional initiation rate and burst duration of target genes, underlying nonlinear gene regulatory functions. Such modulation is consistent with how p300 might shape gene bursting kinetics globally. Altogether, these results suggest an intriguing gene regulation mechanism, in which TF and p300 co-condensation contributes to transcriptional bursting regulation and cooperative gene control.

Abstract: Summary
Persistent virus infections can cause pathogenesis that is debilitating or lethal. During these infections, virus-specific T cells fail to protect due to weakened antiviral activity or failure to persist. These outcomes are governed by histone modifications, although it is unknown which enzymes contribute to T cell loss or impaired function over time. In this study, we show that T cell receptor-stimulated CD8+ T cells increase their expression of UTX (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome) to enhance gene expression. During chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, UTX binds to enhancers and transcription start sites of effector genes, allowing for improved cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated protection, independent of its trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) demethylase activity. UTX also limits the frequency and durability of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, which correspond to increased expression of inhibitory receptors. Thus, UTX guides gene expression patterns in CD8+ T cells, advancing early antiviral defenses while reducing the longevity of CD8+ T cell responses.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial carriers (MCs) mediate the passage of small molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), enabling regulated crosstalk between compartmentalized reactions. Despite MCs representing the largest family of solute carriers in mammals, most have not been subjected to a comprehensive investigation, limiting our understanding of their metabolic contributions. Here, we functionally characterize SFXN1, a member of the non-canonical, sideroflexin family. We find that SFXN1, an integral IMM protein with an uneven number of transmembrane domains, is a TIM22 complex substrate. SFXN1 deficiency leads to mitochondrial respiratory chain impairments, most detrimental to complex III (CIII) biogenesis, activity, and assembly, compromising coenzyme Q levels. The CIII dysfunction is independent of one-carbon metabolism, the known primary role for SFXN1 as a mitochondrial serine transporter. Instead, SFXN1 supports CIII function by participating in heme and α-ketoglutarate metabolism. Our findings highlight the multiple ways that SFXN1-based amino acid transport impacts mitochondrial and cellular metabolic efficiency.

Abstract: Summary
Cell fate commitment is controlled by cis-regulatory elements often located in remote regions of the genome. To examine the role of long-range DNA interactions in early development, we generated a high-resolution contact map of active enhancers in avian neural crest cells. This analysis uncovered a diverse repertoire of enhancers that are part of the gene regulatory network underlying specification. We found that neural crest identity is largely regulated by cis-regulatory elements that propagate signaling inputs to network components. These genomic sensors display a combination of optimal and suboptimal TCF/LEF-binding sites, which allow cells to respond to Wnt signaling in a position-dependent manner. We propose that, rather than acting as upstream activators, signaling systems feed into regulatory circuits in a hub-and-spoke architecture. These results shed light on the tridimensional organization of the neural crest genome and define how signaling systems provide progenitors with spatial cues that transform their molecular identity.

Abstract: Scales are skin appendages in fishes that evolutionarily predate feathers in birds and hair in mammals. Zebrafish scales are dermal in origin and develop during metamorphosis. Understanding regulation of scale development in zebrafish offers an exciting possibility of unraveling how the mechanisms of skin appendage formation evolved in lower vertebrates and whether these mechanisms remained conserved in birds and mammals. Here we have investigated the expression and function of twist 2/dermo1 gene – known for its function in feather and hair formation - in scale development and regeneration. We show that of the four zebrafish twist paralogues, twist2/dermo1 and twist3 are expressed in the scale forming cells during scale development. Their expression is also upregulated during scale regeneration. Our knockout analysis reveals that twist2/dermo1 gene functions in the maintenance of the scale shape and organization during development as well as regeneration. We further show that the expression of twist2/dermo1 and twist3 is regulated by Wnt signaling. Our results demonstrate that the function of twist2/dermo1 in skin appendage formation, presumably under regulation of Wnt signaling, originated during evolution of basal vertebrates.

Abstract: Summary
Synapses exhibit multiple forms of short-term plasticities, which have been attributed to the heterogeneity of neurotransmitter release probability. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the differential release states remain to be fully elucidated. The Unc-13 proteins appear to have key roles in synaptic function through multiple regulatory domains. Here, we report that deleting the M domain in Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-13MR leads to a significant increase in release probability, revealing an inhibitory function of this domain. The inhibitory effect of this domain is eliminated when the C1 and C2B domains are absent or activated, suggesting that the M domain inhibits release probability by suppressing the activity of C1 and C2B domains. When fused directly to the MUNC2C fragment of UNC-13, the M domain greatly enhances release probability. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism by which the UNC-13 M domain regulates synaptic transmission and provides molecular insights into the regulation of release probability.

Abstract: Summary
Radial glial progenitors (RGPs) give rise to the vast majority of neurons and glia in the neocortex. Although RGP behavior and progressive generation of neocortical neurons have been delineated, the exact process of neocortical gliogenesis remains elusive. Here, we report the precise progenitor behavior and gliogenesis program at single-cell resolution in the mouse neocortex. Fractions of dorsal RGPs transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis progressively, producing astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or both in well-defined propensities of ∼60%, 15%, and 25%, respectively, by fate-restricted “intermediate” precursor cells (IPCs). Although the total number of IPCs generated by individual RGPs appears stochastic, the output of individual IPCs exhibit clear patterns in number and subtype and form discrete local subclusters. Clonal loss of tumor suppressor Neurofibromatosis type 1 leads to excessive production of glia selectively, especially oligodendrocyte precursor cells. These results quantitatively delineate the cellular program of neocortical gliogenesis and suggest the cellular and lineage origin of primary brain tumor.

Abstract: Summary
Conscious access to sensory information is likely gated at an intermediate site between primary sensory and transmodal association cortices, but the structure responsible remains unknown. We perform functional neuroimaging to determine the neural correlates of conscious access using a volitional mental imagery task, a report paradigm not confounded by motor behavior. Titrating propofol to loss of behavioral responsiveness in healthy volunteers creates dysfunction of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) in association with an impairment of dynamic transitions of default-mode and dorsal attention networks. Candidate subcortical regions mediating sensory gating or arousal (thalamus, basal forebrain) fail to show this association. The gating role of the AIC is consistent with findings in awake participants, whose conscious access is predicted by pre-stimulus AIC activity near perceptual threshold. These data support the hypothesis that AIC, situated at an intermediate position of the cortical hierarchy, regulates brain network transitions that gate conscious access.

Abstract: Summary
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) regenerate blood cells upon hematopoietic injuries. During homeostasis, HSCs are maintained in a low reactive oxygen species (ROS) state to prevent exhaustion. However, the role of nitric oxide (NO) in controlling HSC regeneration is still unclear. Here, we find increased NO during HSC regeneration with an accumulation of protein aggregation. S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR)-deleted HSCs exhibit a reduced reconstitution capacity and loss of self-renewal after chemotherapeutic injury, which is resolved by inhibition of NO synthesis. Deletion of GSNOR enhances protein S-nitrosylation, resulting in an accumulation of protein aggregation and activation of unfolded protein response (UPR). Treatment of taurocholic acid (TCA), a chemical chaperone, rescues the regeneration defect of Gsnor−/− HSCs after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment. Deletion of C/EBP homologous protein (Chop) restores the reconstitution capacity of Gsnor−/− HSCs. These findings establish a link between S-nitrosylation and protein aggregation in HSC in the context of blood regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are critical regulators involved in diverse biological processes. However, the roles and related mechanisms of lincRNAs in axon development are largely unknown. Here we report an axon-enriched lincRNA regulating axon elongation, referred to as ALAE. Profiling of highly expressed lincRNAs detected abundant and enriched ALAE in the axons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, where it locally promoted axon elongation. Mechanically, ALAE directly interacted with the KH3–4 domains of KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KHSRP) and impeded its association with growth-associated protein 43 (Gap43) mRNA. Knockdown of ALAE reduced the protein but not the mRNA level of GAP43 in the axons of DRG neurons. Furthermore, local disruption of the interaction between ALAE and KHSRP in the axon significantly inhibited Gap43 mRNA translation, impairing axon elongation. This study implies crucial roles of axon-enriched lincRNAs in spatiotemporal regulation of local translation during axon development.

Abstract: Summary
A major goal of current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine efforts is to elicit antibody responses that confer protection. Mapping the epitope targets of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is critical for vaccine design, diagnostics, and development of therapeutics. Here, we develop a pan-coronavirus phage display library to map antibody binding sites at high resolution within the complete viral proteomes of all known human-infecting coronaviruses in patients with mild or moderate/severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We find that the majority of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are targeted to the spike protein, nucleocapsid, and ORF1ab and include sites of mutation in current variants of concern. Some epitopes are identified in the majority of samples, while others are rare, and we find variation in the number of epitopes targeted between individuals. We find low levels of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactivity in individuals with no exposure to the virus and significant cross-reactivity with endemic human coronaviruses (CoVs) in convalescent sera from patients with COVID-19.

Abstract: Animal models represent a crucial tool for biological research, so the establishment of new cultures is fundamental for the discovery of new therapies and the understanding of mechanisms of cell development in the most diverse animals. Here, we report the successful establishment of two new primary cell cultures derived from a South American bat (Artibeus planirostris). The establishment of a new bat culture can help in the investigation of new zoonoses since bats have been proposed as carriers of these diseases. We evaluated the chromosomal stability of cells from different passages. Primary cultures were collected from ear tissues and bone marrow of A. planirostris. Cultures were expanded, and osteogenic and adipogenic inductions were conducted for 21 days. For osteogenic differentiation, the medium was supplemented with 0.1 μM dexamethasone, 3 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 10 μM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate. For adipogenic differentiation, the medium was supplemented with 5 μM rosiglitazone, 0.4 μM insulin, 0.1 mM indomethacin, and 0.1 μM dexamethasone. After the induction period, the cells were stained with Alizarin Red to assess osteogenic differentiation and Oil Red O to assess adipogenic differentiation. We observed the appearance of lipid droplets in adipocytes and the extracellular deposition of calcium matrix by osteocytes, indicating that bone marrow-derived cells and skin-derived cells of A. planirostris could successfully differentiate into these lineages. Also, the number of chromosomes remained stable for both primary cultures during passages 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Abstract: Summary
From biosynthesis to assembly into nucleosomes, histones are handed through a cascade of histone chaperones, which shield histones from non-specific interactions. Whether mechanisms exist to safeguard the histone fold during histone chaperone handover events or to release trapped intermediates is unclear. Using structure-guided and functional proteomics, we identify and characterize a histone chaperone function of DNAJC9, a heat shock co-chaperone that promotes HSP70-mediated catalysis. We elucidate the structure of DNAJC9, in a histone H3-H4 co-chaperone complex with MCM2, revealing how this dual histone and heat shock co-chaperone binds histone substrates. We show that DNAJC9 recruits HSP70-type enzymes via its J domain to fold histone H3-H4 substrates: upstream in the histone supply chain, during replication- and transcription-coupled nucleosome assembly, and to clean up spurious interactions. With its dual functionality, DNAJC9 integrates ATP-resourced protein folding into the histone supply pathway to resolve aberrant intermediates throughout the dynamic lives of histones.

Abstract: Summary
The Shieldin complex shields double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) from nucleolytic resection. Curiously, the penultimate Shieldin component, SHLD1, is one of the least abundant mammalian proteins. Here, we report that the transcription factors THAP1, YY1, and HCF1 bind directly to the SHLD1 promoter, where they cooperatively maintain the low basal expression of SHLD1, thereby ensuring a proper balance between end protection and resection during DSB repair. The loss of THAP1-dependent SHLD1 expression confers cross-resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor and cisplatin in BRCA1-deficient cells and shorter progression-free survival in ovarian cancer patients. Moreover, the embryonic lethality and PARPi sensitivity of BRCA1-deficient mice is rescued by ablation of SHLD1. Our study uncovers a transcriptional network that directly controls DSB repair choice and suggests a potential link between DNA damage and pathogenic THAP1 mutations, found in patients with the neurodevelopmental movement disorder adult-onset torsion dystonia type 6.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of insulin-secreting pancreatic β cells through apoptosis contributes to the progression of type 2 diabetes, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identify a pathway in which the cell death inhibitor ARC paradoxically becomes a killer during diabetes. While cytoplasmic ARC maintains β cell viability and pancreatic architecture, a pool of ARC relocates to the nucleus to induce β cell apoptosis in humans with diabetes and several pathophysiologically distinct mouse models. β cell death results through the coordinate downregulation of serpins (serine protease inhibitors) not previously known to be synthesized and secreted by β cells. Loss of the serpin α1-antitrypsin from the extracellular space unleashes elastase, triggering the disruption of β cell anchorage and subsequent cell death. Administration of α1-antitrypsin to mice with diabetes prevents β cell death and metabolic abnormalities. These data uncover a pathway for β cell loss in type 2 diabetes and identify an FDA-approved drug that may impede progression of this syndrome.

Abstract: Summary
Calcium transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria is a critical contributor to apoptosis. B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) ovarian killer (BOK) localizes to the ER and binds the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosophate receptor (IP3R). Here, we show that BOK is necessary for baseline mitochondrial calcium levels and stimulus-induced calcium transfer from the ER to the mitochondria. Murine embryonic fibroblasts deficient for BOK have decreased proximity of the ER to the mitochondria and altered protein composition of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which form essential calcium microdomains. Rescue of the ER-mitochondrial juxtaposition with drug-inducible interorganelle linkers reveals a kinetic disruption, which when overcome in Bok−/− cells is still insufficient to rescue thapsigargin-induced calcium transfer and apoptosis. Likewise, a BOK mutant unable to interact with IP3R restores ER-mitochondrial proximity, but not ER-mitochondrial calcium transfer, MAM protein composition, or apoptosis. This work identifies the dynamic coordination of ER-mitochondrial contact by BOK as an important control point for apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
We have analyzed the link between the gene regulation and growth during the early stages of flower development in Arabidopsis. Starting from time-lapse images, we generated a 4D atlas of early flower development, including cell lineage, cellular growth rates, and the expression patterns of regulatory genes. This information was introduced in MorphoNet, a web-based platform. Using computational models, we found that the literature-based molecular network only explained a minority of the gene expression patterns. This was substantially improved by adding regulatory hypotheses for individual genes. Correlating growth with the combinatorial expression of multiple regulators led to a set of hypotheses for the action of individual genes in morphogenesis. This identified the central factor LEAFY as a potential regulator of heterogeneous growth, which was supported by quantifying growth patterns in a leafy mutant. By providing an integrated view, this atlas should represent a fundamental step toward mechanistic models of flower development.

Abstract: Summary
RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) are involved in the discrimination of self versus non-self via the recognition of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Emerging evidence suggests that immunostimulatory dsRNAs are ubiquitously expressed but are disrupted or sequestered by cellular RNA binding proteins (RBPs). TDP-43 is an RBP associated with multiple neurological disorders and is essential for cell viability. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 regulates the accumulation of immunostimulatory dsRNA. The immunostimulatory RNA is identified as RNA polymerase III transcripts, including 7SL and Alu retrotransposons, and we demonstrate that the RNA-binding activity of TDP-43 is required to prevent immune stimulation. The dsRNAs activate a RIG-I-dependent interferon (IFN) response, which promotes necroptosis. Genetic inactivation of the RLR-pathway rescues the interferon-mediated cell death associated with loss of TDP-43. Collectively, our study describes a role for TDP-43 in preventing the accumulation of endogenous immunostimulatory dsRNAs and uncovers an intricate relationship between the control of cellular gene expression and IFN-mediated cell death.

Abstract: Summary
N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a DNA-methylating agent that has been discovered to contaminate water, food, and drugs. The alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG) removes methylated bases to initiate the base excision repair (BER) pathway. To understand how gene-environment interactions impact disease susceptibility, we study Aag-knockout (Aag−/−) and Aag-overexpressing mice that harbor increased levels of either replication-blocking lesions (3-methyladenine [3MeA]) or strand breaks (BER intermediates), respectively. Remarkably, the disease outcome switches from cancer to lethality simply by changing AAG levels. To understand the underlying basis for this observation, we integrate a suite of molecular, cellular, and physiological analyses. We find that unrepaired 3MeA is somewhat toxic, but highly mutagenic (promoting cancer), whereas excess strand breaks are poorly mutagenic and highly toxic (suppressing cancer and promoting lethality). We demonstrate that the levels of a single DNA repair protein tip the balance between blocks and breaks and thus dictate the disease consequences of DNA damage.

Abstract: Summary
We present a sheathless, microfluidic imaging flow cytometer that incorporates stroboscopic illumination for blur-free fluorescence detection at ultra-high analytical throughput. The imaging platform is capable of multiparametric fluorescence quantification and sub-cellular localization of these structures down to 500 nm with microscopy image quality. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach through the analysis and localization of P-bodies and stress granules in yeast and human cells using fluorescence and bright-field detection at analytical throughputs in excess of 60,000 and 400,000 cells/s, respectively. Results highlight the utility of our imaging flow cytometer in directly investigating phase-separated compartments within cellular environments and screening rare events at the sub-cellular level for a range of diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Summary
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysregulation is associated with pathologies including neurodegenerative, muscular, and diabetic conditions. Depletion of ER calcium can lead to the loss of resident proteins in a process termed exodosis. To identify compounds that attenuate the redistribution of ER proteins under pathological conditions, we performed a quantitative high-throughput screen using the Gaussia luciferase (GLuc)-secreted ER calcium modulated protein (SERCaMP) assay, which monitors secretion of ER-resident proteins triggered by calcium depletion. We identify several clinically used drugs, including bromocriptine, and further characterize them using assays to measure effects on ER calcium, ER stress, and ER exodosis. Bromocriptine elicits protective effects in cell-based models of exodosis as well as in vivo models of stroke and diabetes. Bromocriptine analogs with reduced dopamine receptor activity retain similar efficacy in stabilizing the ER proteome, indicating a non-canonical mechanism of action. This study describes a strategic approach to identify small-molecule drugs capable of improving ER proteostasis in human disease conditions.

Abstract: Summary
Host-microbe interactions orchestrate skin homeostasis, the dysregulation of which has been implicated in chronic inflammatory conditions such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Here, we show that Staphylococcus cohnii is a skin commensal capable of beneficially inhibiting skin inflammation. We find that Tmem79−/− mice spontaneously develop interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing T-cell-driven skin inflammation. Comparative skin microbiome analysis reveals that the disease activity index is negatively associated with S. cohnii. Inoculation with S. cohnii strains isolated from either mouse or human skin microbiota significantly prevents and ameliorates dermatitis in Tmem79−/− mice without affecting pathobiont burden. S. cohnii colonization is accompanied by activation of host glucocorticoid-related pathways and induction of anti-inflammatory genes in the skin and is therefore effective at suppressing inflammation in diverse pathobiont-independent dermatitis models, including chemically induced, type 17, and type 2 immune-driven models. As such, S. cohnii strains have great potential as effective live biotherapeutics for skin inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
As the global COVID-19 pandemic progresses, it is paramount to gain knowledge on adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in children to define immune correlates of protection upon immunization or infection. We analyzed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and their neutralizing activity (PRNT) in 66 COVID-19-infected children at 7 (±2) days after symptom onset. Individuals with specific humoral responses presented faster virus clearance and lower viral load associated with a reduced in vitro infectivity. We demonstrated that the frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+CD40L+ T cells and Spike-specific B cells were associated with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the magnitude of neutralizing activity. The plasma proteome confirmed the association between cellular and humoral SARS-CoV-2 immunity, and PRNT+ patients show higher viral signal transduction molecules (SLAMF1, CD244, CLEC4G). This work sheds lights on cellular and humoral anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses in children, which may drive future vaccination trial endpoints and quarantine measures policies.

Abstract: Summary
Itaconate is a unique regulatory metabolite that is induced upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation in myeloid cells. Here, we demonstrate major inflammatory tolerance and cell death phenotypes associated with itaconate production in activated macrophages. We show that endogenous itaconate is a key regulator of the signal 2 of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation after long lipopolysaccharide (LPS) priming, which establishes tolerance to late NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We show that itaconate acts synergistically with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and that the ability of various TLR ligands to establish NLRP3 inflammasome tolerance depends on the pattern of co-expression of IRG1 and iNOS. Mechanistically, itaconate accumulation upon prolonged inflammatory stimulation prevents full caspase-1 activation and processing of gasdermin D, which we demonstrate to be post-translationally modified by endogenous itaconate. Altogether, our data demonstrate that metabolic rewiring in inflammatory macrophages establishes tolerance to NLRP3 inflammasome activation that, if uncontrolled, can result in pyroptotic cell death and tissue damage.

Abstract: Phosphatidylserine (PS), a negatively charged phospholipid exclusively located in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, is involved in various cellular processes such as blood coagulation, myoblast fusion, mammalian fertilization, and clearance of apoptotic cells. Proteins that specifically interact with PS must be identified to comprehensively understand the cellular processes involving PS. However, only a limited number of proteins are known to associate with PS. To identify PS-associating proteins, we performed a pulldown assay using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads on which biotin-linked PS was immobilized. Using this approach, we identified Hsd17b4, a peroxisomal protein, as a PS-associating protein. Hsd17b4 strongly associated with PS, but not with phosphatidylcholine or sphingomyelin, and the Scp-2-like domain of Hsd17b4 was responsible for this association. The association was disrupted by PS in liposomes, but not by free PS or the components of PS. In addition, translocation of PS to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane enriched Hsd17b4 in peroxisomes. Collectively, this study suggests an unexpected role of PS as a regulator of the subcellular localization of Hsd17b4.

Abstract: Summary
Cas9 in complex with a programmable guide RNA targets specific double-stranded DNA for cleavage. By harnessing Cas9 as a programmable loader of superhelicase to genomic DNA, we report a physiological-temperature DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method termed genome oligopaint via local denaturation (GOLD) FISH. Instead of global denaturation as in conventional DNA FISH, loading a superhelicase at a Cas9-generated nick allows for local DNA denaturation, reducing nonspecific binding of probes and avoiding harsh treatments such as heat denaturation. GOLD FISH relies on Cas9 cleaving target DNA sequences and avoids the high nuclear background associated with other genome labeling methods that rely on Cas9 binding. The excellent signal brightness and specificity enable us to image nonrepetitive genomic DNA loci and analyze the conformational differences between active and inactive X chromosomes. Finally, GOLD FISH could be used for rapid identification of HER2 gene amplification in patient tissue.

Abstract: Summary
High dietary salt increases arterial pressure partly through activation of magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCVP) that secrete the antidiuretic and vasoconstrictor hormone vasopressin (VP) into the circulation. Here, we show that the intrinsic and synaptic excitation of MNCVP caused by hypertonicity are differentially potentiated in two models of salt-dependent hypertension in rats. One model combined salty chow with a chronic subpressor dose of angiotensin II (AngII-salt), the other involved replacing drinking water with 2% NaCl (salt loading, SL). In both models, we observed a significant increase in the quantal amplitude of EPSCs on MNCVP. However, model-specific changes were also observed. AngII-salt increased the probability of glutamate release by osmoreceptor afferents and increased overall excitatory network drive. In contrast, SL specifically increased membrane stiffness and the intrinsic osmosensitivity of MNCVP. These results reveal that dietary salt increases the excitability of MNCVP through effects on the cell-autonomous and synaptic osmoresponsiveness of MNCVP.

Abstract: Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently a global pandemic. CoVs are known to generate negative subgenomes (subgenomic RNAs [sgRNAs]) through transcription-regulating sequence (TRS)-dependent template switching, but the global dynamic landscapes of coronaviral subgenomes and regulatory rules remain unclear. Here, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) short-read and Nanopore long-read poly(A) RNA sequencing in two cell types at multiple time points after infection with SARS-CoV-2, we identified hundreds of template switches and constructed the dynamic landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomes. Interestingly, template switching could occur in a bidirectional manner, with diverse SARS-CoV-2 subgenomes generated from successive template-switching events. The majority of template switches result from RNA-RNA interactions, including seed and compensatory modes, with terminal pairing status as a key determinant. Two TRS-independent template switch modes are also responsible for subgenome biogenesis. Our findings reveal the subgenome landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and its regulatory features, providing a molecular basis for understanding subgenome biogenesis and developing novel anti-viral strategies.

Abstract: Summary
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are classified as large EVs (l-EVs, or microvesicles) and small EVs (s-EVs, or exosomes). S-EVs are thought to be generated from endosomes through a process that mainly depends on the ESCRT protein complex, including ALG-2 interacting protein X (ALIX). However, the mechanisms of l-EV generation from the plasma membrane have not been identified. Membrane curvatures are generated by the bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) family proteins, among which the inverse BAR (I-BAR) proteins are involved in filopodial protrusions. Here, we show that the I-BAR proteins, including missing in metastasis (MIM), generate l-EVs by scission of filopodia. Interestingly, MIM-containing l-EV production was promoted by in vivo equivalent external forces and by the suppression of ALIX, suggesting an alternative mechanism of vesicle formation to s-EVs. The MIM-dependent l-EVs contained lysophospholipids and proteins, including IRS4 and Rac1, which stimulated the migration of recipient cells through lamellipodia formation. Thus, these filopodia-dependent l-EVs, which we named as filopodia-derived vesicles (FDVs), modify cellular behavior.

Abstract: Summary
Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6i) delay progression of metastatic breast cancer. However, complete responses are uncommon and tumors eventually relapse. Here, we show that CDK4/6i can enhance efficacy of T cell-based therapies, such as adoptive T cell transfer or T cell-activating antibodies anti-OX40/anti-4-1BB, in murine breast cancer models. This effect is driven by the induction of chemokines CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 in CDK4/6i-treated tumor cells facilitating recruitment of activated CD8+ T cells, but not Tregs, into the tumor. Mechanistically, chemokine induction is associated with metabolic stress that CDK4/6i treatment induces in breast cancer cells. Despite the cell cycle arrest, CDK4/6i-treated cells retain high metabolic activity driven by deregulated PI3K/mTOR pathway. This causes cell hypertrophy and increases mitochondrial content/activity associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory stress response. Our findings uncover a link between tumor metabolic vulnerabilities and anti-tumor immunity and support further development of CDK4/6i and immunotherapy combinations.

Abstract: Summary
Disruption of sphingolipid homeostasis is known to cause neurological disorders, but the mechanisms by which specific sphingolipid species modulate pathogenesis remain unclear. The last step of de novo sphingolipid synthesis is the conversion of dihydroceramide to ceramide by dihydroceramide desaturase (human DEGS1; Drosophila Ifc). Loss of ifc leads to dihydroceramide accumulation, oxidative stress, and photoreceptor degeneration, whereas human DEGS1 variants are associated with leukodystrophy and neuropathy. In this work, we demonstrate that DEGS1/ifc regulates Rac1 compartmentalization in neuronal cells and that dihydroceramide alters the association of active Rac1 with organelle-mimicking membranes. We further identify the Rac1-NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex as the major cause of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in ifc-knockout (ifc-KO) photoreceptors and in SH-SY5Y cells with the leukodystrophy-associated DEGS1H132R variant. Suppression of Rac1-NOX activity rescues degeneration of ifc-KO photoreceptors and ameliorates oxidative stress in DEGS1H132R-carrying cells. Therefore, we conclude that DEGS1/ifc deficiency causes dihydroceramide accumulation, resulting in Rac1 mislocalization and NOX-dependent neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of glioma, with poor prognosis exhibited by most patients, and a median survival time of less than 2 years. We assemble a cohort of 87 GBM patients whose survival ranges from less than 3 months and up to 10 years and perform both high-resolution mass spectrometry proteomics and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Integrative analysis of protein expression, RNA expression, and patient clinical information enables us to identify specific immune, metabolic, and developmental processes associated with survival as well as determine whether they are shared between expression layers or are layer specific. Our analyses reveal a stronger association between proteomic profiles and survival and identify unique protein-based classification, distinct from the established RNA-based classification. By integrating published single-cell RNA-seq data, we find a connection between subpopulations of GBM tumors and survival. Overall, our findings establish proteomic heterogeneity in GBM as a gateway to understanding poor survival.

Abstract: Summary
Bacterial genotoxins cause DNA damage in eukaryotic cells, resulting in activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) in vitro. These toxins are produced by Gram-negative bacteria, enriched in the microbiota of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. However, their role in infection remains poorly characterized. We address the role of typhoid toxin in modulation of the host-microbial interaction in health and disease. Infection with a genotoxigenic Salmonella protects mice from intestinal inflammation. We show that the presence of an active genotoxin promotes DNA fragmentation and senescence in vivo, which is uncoupled from an inflammatory response and unexpectedly associated with induction of an anti-inflammatory environment. The anti-inflammatory response is lost when infection occurs in mice with acute colitis. These data highlight a complex context-dependent crosstalk between bacterial-genotoxin-induced DDR and the host immune response, underlining an unexpected role for bacterial genotoxins.

Abstract: Summary
Pathologies of the micro- and macrovascular systems are a hallmark of the metabolic syndrome, which can lead to chronically elevated blood pressure. However, the underlying pathomechanisms involved still need to be clarified. Here, we report that an obesity-associated increase in serum leptin triggers the select expansion of the micro-angioarchitecture in pre-autonomic brain centers that regulate hemodynamic homeostasis. By using a series of cell- and region-specific loss- and gain-of-function models, we show that this pathophysiological process depends on hypothalamic astroglial hypoxia-inducible factor 1α-vascular endothelial growth factor (HIF1α-VEGF) signaling downstream of leptin signaling. Importantly, several distinct models of HIF1α-VEGF pathway disruption in astrocytes are protected not only from obesity-induced hypothalamic angiopathy but also from sympathetic hyperactivity or arterial hypertension. These results suggest that hyperleptinemia promotes obesity-induced hypertension via a HIF1α-VEGF signaling cascade in hypothalamic astrocytes while establishing a novel mechanistic link that connects hypothalamic micro-angioarchitecture with control over systemic blood pressure.

Abstract: DNA methylation, and consequent down-regulation, of tumour suppressor genes occurs in response to epigenetic stimuli during cancer development. Similarly, human oncoviruses, including human papillomavirus (HPV), up-regulate and augment DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities, thereby decreasing tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) expression. Ubiquitin-like containing PHD and RING finger domain 1 (UHRF1), an epigenetic regulator of DNA methylation, is overexpressed in HPV-induced cervical cancers. Here, we investigated the role of UHRF1 in cervical cancer by knocking down its expression in HeLa cells using lentiviral-encoded short hairpin (sh)RNA and performing cDNA microarrays. We detected significantly elevated expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a known TSG, in UHRF1-knockdown cells, and this gene is hypermethylated in cervical cancer tissue and cell lines, as indicated by whole-genome methylation analysis. Up-regulation of UHRF1 and decreased TXNIP were further detected in cervical cancer by western blot and immunohistochemistry and confirmed by Oncomine database analysis. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified the inverted CCAAT domain-containing UHRF1-binding site in the TXNIP promoter and demonstrated UHRF1 knockdown decreases UHRF1 promoter binding and enhances TXNIP expression through demethylation of this region. TXNIP promoter CpG methylation was further confirmed in cervical cancer tissue by pyrosequencing and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Critically, down-regulation of UHRF1 by siRNA or UHRF1 antagonist (thymoquinone) induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), which stabilises and promotes UHRF1 function, is increased by HPV viral protein E6/E7 overexpression. These results indicate HPV might induce carcinogenesis through UHRF1-mediated TXNIP promoter methylation, thus suggesting a possible link between CpG methylation and cervical cancer.

Abstract: Summary
The maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis requires PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)-dependent mitophagy, and mutations in PINK1 are associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). PINK1 is also downregulated in tumor cells with PTEN mutations. However, there is limited information concerning the role of PINK1 in tissue growth and tumorigenesis. Here, we show that the loss of pink1 caused multiple growth defects independent of its pathological target, Parkin. Moreover, knocking down pink1 in muscle cells induced hyperglycemia and limited systemic organismal growth by the induction of Imaginal morphogenesis protein-Late 2 (ImpL2). Similarly, disrupting PTEN activity in multiple tissues impaired systemic growth by reducing pink1 expression, resembling wasting-like syndrome in cancer patients. Furthermore, the re-expression of PINK1 fully rescued defects in carbohydrate metabolism and systemic growth induced by the tissue-specific pten mutations. Our data suggest a function for PINK1 in regulating systemic growth in Drosophila and shed light on its role in wasting in the context of PTEN mutations.

Abstract: Summary
Multi-subunit SMC ATPases control chromosome superstructure apparently by catalyzing a DNA-loop-extrusion reaction. SMC proteins harbor an ABC-type ATPase “head” and a “hinge” dimerization domain connected by a coiled coil “arm.” Two arms in a SMC dimer can co-align, thereby forming a rod-shaped particle. Upon ATP binding, SMC heads engage, and arms are thought to separate. Here, we study the shape of Bacillus subtilis Smc-ScpAB by electron-spin resonance spectroscopy. Arm separation is readily detected proximal to the heads in the absence of ligands, and separation near the hinge largely depends on ATP and DNA. Artificial blockage of arm opening eliminates DNA stimulation of ATP hydrolysis but does not prevent basal ATPase activity. We report an arm contact as being important for controlling the transformations. Point mutations at this arm interface eliminated Smc function. We propose that partially open, intermediary conformations provide directionality to SMC DNA translocation by (un)binding suitable DNA substrates.

Abstract: Vancomycin response regulator (VncR) is a pneumococcal response regulator of the VncRS two-component signal transduction system (TCS) of Streptococcus pneumoniae. VncRS regulates bacterial autolysis and vancomycin resistance. VncR contains two different functional domains, the N-terminal receiver domain and C-terminal effector domain. Here, we investigated VncR C-terminal DNA binding domain (VncRc) structure using a crystallization approach. Crystallization was performed using the micro-batch method. The crystals diffracted to a 1.964 Å resolution and belonged to space group P212121. The crystal unit-cell parameters were a = 25.71 Å, b = 52.97 Å, and c = 60.61 Å. The structure of VncRc had a helix-turn-helix motif highly similar to the response regulator PhoB of Escherichia coli. In isothermal titration calorimetry and size exclusion chromatography results, VncR formed a complex with VncS, a sensor histidine kinase of pneumococcal TCS. Determination of VncR structure will provide insight into the mechanism by how VncR binds to target genes.

Abstract: Summary
Phospholipid scrambling in dying cells promotes phosphatidylserine exposure, a critical process for efferocytosis. We previously identified the Xkr family protein Xkr4 as a phospholipid-scrambling protein, but its activation mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show that Xkr4 is activated in two steps: dimer formation by caspase-mediated cleavage and structural change caused by activating factors. To identify the factors, we developed a new screening system, “revival screening,” using a CRISPR sgRNA library. Applying this system, we identified the nuclear protein XRCC4 as the single candidate for the Xkr4 activator. Upon apoptotic stimuli, XRCC4, contained in the DNA repair complex, is cleaved by caspases, and its C-terminal fragment with an intrinsically disordered region is released into the cytoplasm. Protein interaction screening showed that the fragment interacts directly with the Xkr4 dimer to activate it. This study demonstrates that caspase-mediated cleavage releases a nuclear protein fragment for direct regulation of lipid dynamics on the plasma membrane.

Abstract: Summary
ATP-competitive inhibitors have been developed as promising anti-cancer agents. However, drug-resistance frequently occurs, and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we show that the activation of c-Src and its downstream phosphorylation cascade can be paradoxically induced by Src-targeted and RTK-targeted kinase inhibitors. We reveal that inhibitor binding induces a conformational change in c-Src, leading to the association of the active form c-Src with focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Reduction of the inhibitor concentration results in the dissociation of inhibitors from the c-Src-FAK complex, which allows c-Src to phosphorylate FAK and initiate FAK-Grb2-mediated Erk signaling. Furthermore, a drug-resistant mutation in c-Src, which reduces the affinity of inhibitors for c-Src, converts Src inhibitors into facilitators of cell proliferation by enhancing the phosphorylation of FAK and Erk in c-Src-mutated cells. Our data thus reveal paradoxical enhancement of cell growth evoked by target-based kinase inhibitors, providing potentially important clues for the future development of effective and safe cancer treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Recent studies in both mice and humans have suggested that gut microbiota could modulate tumor responsiveness to chemo- or immunotherapies. However, the underlying mechanism is not clear yet. Here, we found that gut microbial metabolites, especially butyrate, could promote the efficacy of oxaliplatin by modulating CD8+ T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. Butyrate treatment directly boosted the antitumor cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses both in vitro and in vivo in an ID2-dependent manner by promoting the IL-12 signaling pathway. In humans, the oxaliplatin responder cancer patients exhibited a higher amount of serum butyrate than did non-responders, which could also increase ID2 expression and function of human CD8+ T cells. Together, our findings suggest that the gut microbial metabolite butyrate could promote antitumor therapeutic efficacy through the ID2-dependent regulation of CD8+ T cell immunity, indicating that gut microbial metabolites could be effective as a part of cancer therapy.

Abstract: Summary
The human ubiquitin proteasome system, composed of over 700 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) and deubiquitinases (DUBs), has been difficult to characterize systematically and phenotypically. We performed chemical-genetic CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify E3s/DUBs whose loss renders cells sensitive or resistant to 41 compounds targeting a broad range of biological processes, including cell cycle progression, genome stability, metabolism, and vesicular transport. Genes and compounds clustered functionally, with inhibitors of related pathways interacting similarly with E3s/DUBs. Some genes, such as FBXW7, showed interactions with many of the compounds. Others, such as RNF25 and FBXO42, showed interactions primarily with a single compound (methyl methanesulfonate for RNF25) or a set of related compounds (the mitotic cluster for FBXO42). Mutation of several E3s with sensitivity to mitotic inhibitors led to increased aberrant mitoses, suggesting a role for these genes in cell cycle regulation. Our comprehensive CRISPR-Cas9 screen uncovered 466 gene-compound interactions covering 25% of the interrogated E3s/DUBs.

Abstract: Summary
Mediator is a universal adaptor for transcription control. It serves as an interface between gene-specific activator or repressor proteins and the general RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription machinery. Previous structural studies revealed a relatively small part of Mediator and none of the gene activator-binding regions. We have determined the cryo-EM structure of the Mediator at near-atomic resolution. The structure reveals almost all amino acid residues in ordered regions, including the major targets of activator proteins, the Tail module, and the Med1 subunit of the Middle module. Comparison of Mediator structures with and without pol II reveals conformational changes that propagate across the entire Mediator, from Head to Tail, coupling activator- and pol II-interacting regions.

Abstract: Summary
There is an urgent need for antivirals to treat the newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To identify new candidates, we screen a repurposing library of ∼3,000 drugs. Screening in Vero cells finds few antivirals, while screening in human Huh7.5 cells validates 23 diverse antiviral drugs. Extending our studies to lung epithelial cells, we find that there are major differences in drug sensitivity and entry pathways used by SARS-CoV-2 in these cells. Entry in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells is pH independent and requires TMPRSS2, while entry in Vero and Huh7.5 cells requires low pH and triggering by acid-dependent endosomal proteases. Moreover, we find nine drugs are antiviral in respiratory cells, seven of which have been used in humans, and three are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, including cyclosporine. We find that the antiviral activity of cyclosporine is targeting Cyclophilin rather than calcineurin, revealing essential host targets that have the potential for rapid clinical implementation.

Abstract: Slit-Robo signaling has been implicated in regulating several steps of retinal ganglion cell axon guidance, with a central role assigned to Slit2. We report here the phenotypical characterization of a CRISPR-Cas9-generated zebrafish null mutant for this gene, along with a detailed analysis of its expression pattern by WM-FISH. All evident defects in the optic axons in slit2−/− mutants were detected outside the retina, coincident with the major sites of expression at the ventral forebrain, around the developing optic nerve and anterior to the optic chiasm/proximal tract. Anterograde axon tracing experiments in zygotic and maternal-zygotic mutants, as well as morphants, showed the occurrence of axon sorting defects, which appeared mild at the optic nerve level, but more severe in the optic chiasm and the proximal tract. A remarkable sorting defect was the usual splitting of one of the optic nerves in two branches that surrounded the contralateral nerve at the chiasm. Although all axons eventually crossed the midline, the retinotopic order appeared lost at the proximal optic tract, to eventually correct distally. Time-lapse analysis demonstrated the sporadic occurrence of axon misrouting at the chiasm level, which could be responsible for the sorting errors. Our results support previous evidence of a channeling role for Slit molecules in retinal ganglion cell axons at the optic nerve, in addition to a function in the segregation of axons coming from each nerve and from different retinal regions at the medio-ventral area of the forebrain.

Abstract: Summary
Contacts between organelles create microdomains that play major roles in regulating key intracellular activities and signaling pathways, but whether they also regulate systemic functions remains unknown. Here, we report the ultrastructural organization and dynamics of the inter-organellar contact established by sheets of curved rough endoplasmic reticulum closely wrapped around the mitochondria (wrappER). To elucidate the in vivo function of this contact, mouse liver fractions enriched in wrappER-associated mitochondria are analyzed by transcriptomics, proteomics, and lipidomics. The biochemical signature of the wrappER points to a role in the biogenesis of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Altering wrappER-mitochondria contacts curtails VLDL secretion and increases hepatic fatty acids, lipid droplets, and neutral lipid content. Conversely, acute liver-specific ablation of Mttp, the most upstream regulator of VLDL biogenesis, recapitulates this hepatic dyslipidemia phenotype and promotes remodeling of the wrappER-mitochondria contact. The discovery that liver wrappER-mitochondria contacts participate in VLDL biology suggests an involvement of inter-organelle contacts in systemic lipid homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
The Melanocortin-4 Receptor (MC4R) plays a pivotal role in energy homeostasis. We used human MC4R mutations associated with an increased or decreased risk of obesity to dissect mechanisms that regulate MC4R function. Most obesity-associated mutations impair trafficking to the plasma membrane (PM), whereas obesity-protecting mutations either accelerate recycling to the PM or decrease internalization, resulting in enhanced signaling. MC4R mutations that do not affect canonical Gαs protein-mediated signaling, previously considered to be non-pathogenic, nonetheless disrupt agonist-induced internalization, β-arrestin recruitment, and/or coupling to Gαs, establishing their causal role in severe obesity. Structural mapping reveals ligand-accessible sites by which MC4R couples to effectors and residues involved in the homodimerization of MC4R, which is disrupted by multiple obesity-associated mutations. Human genetic studies reveal that endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and homodimerization regulate MC4R function to a level that is physiologically relevant, supporting the development of chaperones, agonists, and allosteric modulators of MC4R for weight loss therapy.

Abstract: Summary
At implantation, the embryo establishes contacts with the maternal endometrium. This stage is associated with a high incidence of preclinical pregnancy losses. While the maternal factors underlying uterine receptivity have been investigated, the signals required by the embryo for successful peri-implantation development remain elusive. To explore these, we studied integrin β1 signaling, as embryos deficient for this receptor degenerate at implantation. We demonstrate that the coordinated action of pro-survival signals and localized actomyosin suppression via integrin β1 permits the development of the embryo beyond implantation. Failure of either process leads to developmental arrest and apoptosis. Pharmacological stimulation through fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), coupled with ROCK-mediated actomyosin inhibition, rescues the deficiency of integrin β1, promoting progression to post-implantation stages. Mutual exclusion between integrin β1 and actomyosin seems to be conserved in the human embryo, suggesting the possibility that these mechanisms could also underlie the transition of the human epiblast from pre- to post-implantation.

Abstract: Summary
Many cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), depend on autophagy-mediated scavenging and recycling of intracellular macromolecules, suggesting that autophagy blockade should cause tumor starvation and regression. However, until now autophagy-inhibiting monotherapies have not demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity. We now show that autophagy blockade prompts established PDAC to upregulate and utilize an alternative nutrient procurement pathway: macropinocytosis (MP) that allows tumor cells to extract nutrients from extracellular sources and use them for energy generation. The autophagy to MP switch, which may be evolutionarily conserved and not cancer cell restricted, depends on activation of transcription factor NRF2 by the autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1. NRF2 activation by oncogenic mutations, hypoxia, and oxidative stress also results in MP upregulation. Inhibition of MP in autophagy-compromised PDAC elicits dramatic metabolic decline and regression of transplanted and autochthonous tumors, suggesting the therapeutic promise of combining autophagy and MP inhibitors in the clinic.

Abstract: CTCFL is expressed in testis, oocytes and embryonic stem cells, and is aberrantly expressed in malignant cells, and is classified as a cancer-testis gene. We have previously shown by using a tetracycline-inducible Ctcfl transgene that inappropriate expression of Ctcfl negatively impacts fetal development and causes early postnatal lethality in the mouse. The affected pups displayed severe vascular abnormalities and localized hemorrhages in the brain evocative of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) and arteriovenous malformations (AVM) in humans. Thus, we aim to analyze; a) the presence of CCM-related proteins CCM1/KRIT1, CCM2/malcavernin and CCM3/PDCD10 in Ctcfl transgenic animals and, b) whether there is CTCFL expression in human CCM and AVM tissues. Ctcfl transgenic animals exhibited increased CD31 expression in vascular areas of the dermis and periadnexal regions but no difference was observed for vWF and α-SMA expressions. CCM-related proteins CCM1/KRIT1, CCM2/malcavernin and CCM3/PDCD10 were aberrantly expressed in coronal sections of the head in transgenic animals. We also observed CTCFL expression in human CCMs and AVMs. The induced expression of CTCFL resulting in vascular brain malformations in mice combined with the presence of CTCFL in human vascular malformations provide new insights into the role of this gene in vascular development in humans.

Abstract: The decision to move is influenced by sensory, attentional, and motivational cues. One such cue is the quality of the tactile input, with noxious or unpleasant sensations causing an animal to move away from the cue. Processing of painful and unpleasant sensation in the cortex involves multiple brain regions, although the specific role of the brain areas involved in voluntary, rather than reflexive movement away from unpleasant stimuli is not well understood. Here, we focused on the medial subdivision of secondary motor cortex, which is proposed to link sensory and contextual cues to motor action, and tested its role in controlling voluntary movement in the context of an aversive tactile cue. We designed a novel, 3D-printed tactile platform consisting of innocuous (grid) and mildly noxious (spiked) surfaces (50:50 % of total area), which enabled monitoring neuronal activity in the medial frontal cortex by two-photon imaging during a sensory preference task in head-fixed mice. We found that freely moving mice spent significantly less time on a spiked-surface, and that this preference was eliminated by administration of a local anesthetic. At the neuronal level, individual neurons were differentially modulated specific to the tactile surface encountered. At the population level, the neuronal activity was analyzed in relation to the events where mice chose to “stop-on” or “go-from” a specific tactile surface and when they “switched” surfaces without stopping. Notably, each of these three scenarios showed population activity that differed significantly between the grid and spiked tactile surfaces. Collectively, these data provide evidence that tactile quality is encoded within medial frontal cortex. The task pioneered in this study provides a valuable tool to better evaluate mouse models of nociception and pain, using a voluntary task that allows simultaneous recording of preference and choice.

Here, we report two cryo-EM structures of human D3R in complex with an inhibitory G protein and bound to the D3R-selective agonists PD128907 and pramipexole, the latter of which is used to treat patients with Parkinson’s disease. The structures reveal agonist binding modes distinct from the antagonist-bound D3R structure and conformational signatures for ligand-induced receptor activation. Mutagenesis and homology modeling illuminate determinants of ligand specificity across dopamine receptors and the mechanisms for Gi protein coupling. Collectively our work reveals the basis of agonist binding and ligand-induced receptor activation and provides structural templates for designing specific ligands to treat CNS diseases targeting the dopaminergic system.

Abstract: Summary
Neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) is a defining feature of organismal aging that is influenced by peripheral tissues. Clinical observations indicate that skeletal muscle influences CNS aging, but the underlying muscle-to-brain signaling remains unexplored. In Drosophila, we find that moderate perturbation of the proteasome in skeletal muscle induces compensatory preservation of CNS proteostasis during aging. Such long-range stress signaling depends on muscle-secreted Amyrel amylase. Mimicking stress-induced Amyrel upregulation in muscle reduces age-related accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the brain and retina via chaperones. Preservation of proteostasis stems from the disaccharide maltose, which is produced via Amyrel amylase activity. Correspondingly, RNAi for SLC45 maltose transporters reduces expression of Amyrel-induced chaperones and worsens brain proteostasis during aging. Moreover, maltose preserves proteostasis and neuronal activity in human brain organoids challenged by thermal stress. Thus, proteasome stress in skeletal muscle hinders retinal and brain aging by mounting an adaptive response via amylase/maltose.

Abstract: Although microplastics (MPs) have received increasing focus and currently have become an emerging area of research, there is limited knowledge about their effect on whole body histology of fish. In this study, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) early juveniles were exposed to 1, 10, or 100 mg/L of MPs for 15 days and 15 days post-exposure, after which whole body histological examinations were performed. Histological analysis of kidney revealed congestion of blood capillaries, inflammatory cells, loss of basophilic cytoplasm in several tubules, vacuolated tubules, shrinking of convoluted tubules, widening of intertubular space, complete deformation, glomerular atrophy, vacuolated glomerular cells, and signs of fatty tubules. The liver tissue exhibited vacuoles, hydropic degeneration, necrotic area, severe deformation of hepatocytes, pyknotic nuclei, and dilation and congestion of blood sinusoids. The pancreatic tissue revealed shrunken and degenerated acini with pyknotic nuclei, hemorrhage, necrotic area, inflammatory cells, fatty cells, and congested blood capillaries. In the muscle tissue, fiber core dissociation, edema, necrosis, segmented fibers, and inflammatory cells were detected. The gill tissue demonstrated dilation and congestion of blood vessels, complete lamellar fusions, lifting of epithelium, shortening and degeneration of secondary lamellae, hyperplasia, and deposition of MPs between primary lamellae. In the spinal cord and notochord, the effects were degeneration and protrusion of meninges, deformation and deviation of notochord from its central axis, edema, degeneration of notochord (disappearance of vacuolar cells), deviation of spinal cord from the central axis, and loss of vacuolar cells in notochord. The intestinal tissue exhibited degeneration of basement membrane, inflammatory cells, goblet cells, atrophy of submucosa, pyknotic nuclei, hemorrhage, and vacuolization of mucosal cells. The histopathological changes in different organs were noticed even post-exposure in fish exposed to MPs compared to those in control fish and these changes were concentration dependent. In conclusion, these data together with our previous data suggest that MPs can cause different changes, ranging from biochemical alterations in single cells to lesions in the entire tissue, which can affect the vitality and life of fish.

Abstract: Summary
The antibody immune response is essential for the survival of mammals. However, we still lack a systematic understanding of the antibody repertoire. Here, we developed a proteomic strategy to survey, at an unprecedented scale, the landscape of antigen-engaged, circulating camelid heavy-chain antibodies, whose minimal binding fragments are called VHH antibodies or nanobodies. The sensitivity and robustness of this approach were validated with three antigens spanning orders of magnitude in immune responses; thousands of distinct, high-affinity nanobody families were reliably identified and quantified. Using high-throughput structural modeling, cross-linking mass spectrometry, mutagenesis, and deep learning, we mapped and analyzed the epitopes of >100,000 antigen-nanobody complexes. Our results revealed a surprising diversity of ultrahigh-affinity camelid nanobodies for specific antigen binding on various dominant epitope clusters. Nanobodies utilize both shape and charge complementarity to enable highly selective antigen binding. Interestingly, we found that nanobody-antigen binding can mimic conserved intracellular protein-protein interactions. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the Supplemental information.

Abstract: Summary
Ribosome collision because of translational stalling is recognized as a problematic event in translation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hel2, leading to non-canonical subunit dissociation followed by targeting of the faulty nascent peptides for degradation. Although Hel2-mediated quality control greatly contributes to maintenance of cellular protein homeostasis, its physiological role in dealing with endogenous substrates remains unclear. This study utilizes genome-wide analysis, based on selective ribosome profiling, to survey the endogenous substrates for Hel2. This survey reveals that Hel2 binds preferentially to the pre-engaged secretory ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs), which translate upstream of targeting signals. Notably, Hel2 recruitment into secretory RNCs is elevated under signal recognition particle (SRP)-deficient conditions. Moreover, the mitochondrial defects caused by insufficient SRP are enhanced by hel2 deletion, along with mistargeting of secretory proteins into mitochondria. These findings provide insights into risk management in the secretory pathway that maintains cellular protein homeostasis.

Abstract: Summary
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. One major obstacle to treatment is a lack of effective molecular-targeted therapies. In this study, we find that EphA2 expression and signaling are enriched in human HCC and associated with poor prognosis. Loss of EphA2 suppresses the initiation and growth of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, CRISPR/CAS9-mediated EphA2 inhibition significantly delays tumor development in a genetically engineered murine model of HCC. Mechanistically, we discover that targeting EphA2 suppresses both AKT and JAK1/STAT3 signaling, two separate oncogenic pathways in HCC. We also identify a small molecule kinase inhibitor of EphA2 that suppresses tumor progression in a murine HCC model. Together, our results suggest EphA2 as a promising therapeutic target for HCC.

Abstract: Summary
T cells form immunological synapses with professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) resulting in T cell activation and the acquisition of peptide antigen-MHC (pMHC) complexes from the plasma membrane of the APC. They thus become APCs themselves. We investigate the functional outcome of T-T cell antigen presentation by CD4 T cells and find that the antigen-presenting T cells (Tpres) predominantly differentiate into regulatory T cells (Treg), whereas T cells that have been stimulated by Tpres cells predominantly differentiate into Th17 pro-inflammatory cells. Using mice deficient in pMHC uptake by T cells, we show that T-T antigen presentation is important for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalitis and Th17 cell differentiation in vivo. By varying the professional APC:T cell ratio, we can modulate Treg versus Th17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that T-T antigen presentation underlies proinflammatory responses in conditions of antigen scarcity.

Abstract: Summary
Membrane curvature recruits Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR)-domain proteins and induces local F-actin assembly, which further modifies the membrane curvature and dynamics. The downstream molecular pathway in vivo is still unclear. Here, we show that a tubular endomembrane scaffold supported by contractile actomyosin stabilizes the somatic cyst cell membrane folded around rigid spermatid heads during the final stages of sperm maturation in Drosophila testis. The structure resembles an actin “basket” covering the bundle of spermatid heads. Genetic analyses suggest that the actomyosin organization is nucleated exclusively by the formins – Diaphanous and Dishevelled Associated Activator of Morphogenesis (DAAM) – downstream of Rho1, which is recruited by the BAR-domain protein Amphiphysin. Actomyosin activity at the actin basket gathers the spermatid heads into a compact bundle and resists the somatic cell invasion by intruding spermatids. These observations reveal a distinct response mechanism of actin-membrane interactions, which generates a cell-adhesion-like strategy through active clamping.

Abstract: Summary
During cell division, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) ECT2 activates RhoA in a narrow zone at the cell equator in anaphase. ECT2 consists of three BRCT domains (BRCT0, 1, and 2), a catalytic GEF, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. How the conserved BRCT domains spatially and temporally control ECT2 activity remains unclear. We reveal that each BRCT domain makes distinct contributions to the ECT2 function. We find that BRCT0 contributes to, and BRCT1 is essential for, ECT2 activation in anaphase. BRCT2 integrates two functions: GEF inhibition and RACGAP1 binding, which together limit ECT2 activity to a narrow zone at the cell equator. BRCT2-dependent control of active RhoA zone dimension functions in addition to the inhibitory signal of the astral microtubules. Our analysis provides detailed mechanistic insights into how ECT2 activity is regulated and how that regulation ensures, together with other signaling pathways, successful cell division.

Abstract: Summary
Poor maternal diet increases the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in offspring, adding to the ever-increasing prevalence of these diseases. In contrast, we find that maternal exercise improves the metabolic health of offspring, and here, we demonstrate that this occurs through a vitamin D receptor-mediated increase in placental superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) expression and secretion. SOD3 activates an AMPK/TET signaling axis in fetal offspring liver, resulting in DNA demethylation at the promoters of glucose metabolic genes, enhancing liver function, and improving glucose tolerance. In humans, SOD3 is upregulated in serum and placenta from physically active pregnant women. The discovery of maternal exercise-induced cross talk between placenta-derived SOD3 and offspring liver provides a central mechanism for improved offspring metabolic health. These findings may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to limit the transmission of metabolic disease to the next generation.

Abstract: Summary
Sensory hair cells are prone to apoptosis caused by various drugs including aminoglycoside antibiotics. In mammals, this vulnerability results in permanent hearing loss because lost hair cells are not regenerated. Conversely, hair cells regenerate in birds, making the avian inner ear an exquisite model for studying ototoxicity and regeneration. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing and trajectory analysis on control and dying hair cells after aminoglycoside treatment. Interestingly, the two major subtypes of avian cochlear hair cells, tall and short hair cells, respond differently. Dying short hair cells show a noticeable transient upregulation of many more genes than tall hair cells. The most prominent gene group identified is associated with potassium ion conductances, suggesting distinct physiological differences. Moreover, the dynamic characterization of >15,000 genes expressed in tall and short avian hair cells during their apoptotic demise comprises a resource for further investigations toward mammalian hair cell protection and hair cell regeneration.

Abstract: Summary
Intracellular pathogens alter their host cells' mechanics to promote dissemination through tissues. Conversely, host cells may respond to the presence of pathogens by altering their mechanics to limit infection. Here, we monitored epithelial cell monolayers infected with intracellular bacterial pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes or Rickettsia parkeri, over days. Under conditions in which these pathogens trigger innate immune signaling through NF-κB and use actin-based motility to spread non-lytically intercellularly, we found that infected cell domains formed three-dimensional mounds. These mounds resulted from uninfected cells moving toward the infection site, collectively squeezing the softer and less contractile infected cells upward and ejecting them from the monolayer. Bacteria in mounds were less able to spread laterally in the monolayer, limiting the growth of the infection focus, while extruded infected cells underwent cell death. Thus, the coordinated forceful action of uninfected cells actively eliminates large domains of infected cells, consistent with this collective cell response representing an innate immunity-driven process.

Abstract: Summary
The ever-increasing understanding of the complexity of factors and regulatory layers that contribute to immune evasion facilitates the development of immunotherapies. However, the diversity of malignant tumors limits many known mechanisms in specific genetic and epigenetic contexts, manifesting the need to discover general driver genes. Here, we have identified the m6A demethylase FTO as an essential epitranscriptomic regulator utilized by tumors to escape immune surveillance through regulation of glycolytic metabolism. We show that FTO-mediated m6A demethylation in tumor cells elevates the transcription factors c-Jun, JunB, and C/EBPβ, which allows the rewiring of glycolytic metabolism. Fto knockdown impairs the glycolytic activity of tumor cells, which restores the function of CD8+ T cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Furthermore, we developed a small-molecule compound, Dac51, that can inhibit the activity of FTO, block FTO-mediated immune evasion, and synergize with checkpoint blockade for better tumor control, suggesting reprogramming RNA epitranscriptome as a potential strategy for immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
The haploinsufficiency of C9orf72 is implicated in the most common forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but the full spectrum of C9orf72 functions remains to be established. Here, we report that C9orf72 is a mitochondrial inner-membrane-associated protein regulating cellular energy homeostasis via its critical role in the control of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The translocation of C9orf72 from the cytosol to the inter-membrane space is mediated by the redox-sensitive AIFM1/CHCHD4 pathway. In mitochondria, C9orf72 specifically stabilizes translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane domain containing 1 (TIMMDC1), a crucial factor for the assembly of OXPHOS complex I. C9orf72 directly recruits the prohibitin complex to inhibit the m-AAA protease-dependent degradation of TIMMDC1. The mitochondrial complex I function is impaired in C9orf72-linked ALS/FTD patient-derived neurons. These results reveal a previously unknown function of C9orf72 in mitochondria and suggest that defective energy metabolism may underlie the pathogenesis of relevant diseases.

Abstract: Background
The use of growth factors in tissue engineering is often challenging due to their instability and short half-life. The delivery of growth factors with nanocarriers can eliminate these problems. In the present study, we introduced an alginate oxide particle in acellular collagen-alginate composite hydrogel platform for the immobilization and controlled release of VEGF and bFGF to promote angiogenesis.
Methods
The particles were prepared by the oxidation of sodium alginate. Then, they were embedded in collagen-alginate hydrogel. Cytocompatibility of the construct with the human umbilical vein endothelial cells was analyzed through a live/dead assay and scanning electron microscopy. In vitro evaluation of VEGF and bFGF Release Kinetics was done. Moreover, the function of the constructs was confirmed through the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay.
Results
The engineered constructs maintained the human umbilical vein endothelial cells viability, which indicates the non-toxicity of the tested constructs. The presence of VEGF-loaded particles could improve the Total Branching Points in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. In this regard, Total Branching Points was significantly improved in the VEGF group compared to the control group (p = 0.010) and FGF group (p = 0.023).
Conclusion
The results demonstrated the potential role of these particles in regenerative medicine to improve angiogenesis.

Abstract: Summary
CHD8 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8) is a chromatin remodeler associated with autism spectrum disorders. Homozygous Chd8 deletion in mice leads to embryonic lethality, making it difficult to assess whether CHD8 regulates brain development and whether CHD8 haploinsufficiency-related macrocephaly reflects normal CHD8 functions. Here, we report that homozygous conditional knockout of Chd8 restricted to neocortical glutamatergic neurons causes apoptosis-dependent near-complete elimination of neocortical structures. These mice, however, display normal survival and hyperactivity, anxiolytic-like behavior, and increased social interaction. They also show largely normal auditory function and moderately impaired visual and motor functions but enhanced whisker-related somatosensory function. These changes accompany thalamic hyperactivity, revealed by 15.2-Tesla fMRI, and increased intrinsic excitability and decreased inhibitory synaptic transmission in thalamic ventral posterior medial (VPM) neurons involved in somatosensation. These results suggest that excitatory neuronal CHD8 critically regulates neocortical development through anti-apoptotic mechanisms, neocortical elimination distinctly affects cognitive behaviors and sensory-motor functions in mice, and Chd8 haploinsufficiency-related macrocephaly might represent compensatory responses.

Abstract: Summary
To identify genes whose loss confers resistance to CHK1 inhibitors, we perform genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines treated with the CHK1 inhibitor prexasertib (CHK1i). Five of the top six hits of the screens, MYBL2 (B-MYB), LIN54, FOXM1, cyclin A2 (CCNA2), and CDC25B, are cell-cycle-regulated genes that contribute to entry into mitosis. Knockout of MMB-FOXM1 complex components LIN54 and FOXM1 reduce CHK1i-induced DNA replication stress markers and premature mitosis during Late S phase. Activation of a feedback loop between the MMB-FOXM1 complex and CDK1 is required for CHK1i-induced premature mitosis in Late S phase and subsequent replication catastrophe, indicating that dysregulation of the S to M transition is necessary for CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity. These findings provide mechanistic insights into small molecule inhibitors currently studied in clinical trials and provide rationale for combination therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Hosts recognize cytosolic microbial infection via the nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor (NLR) protein family, triggering inflammasome complex assembly to provoke pyroptosis or cytokine-related caspase-1-dependent antimicrobial responses. Pathogens have evolved diverse strategies to antagonize inflammasome activation. Here, Edwardsiella piscicida gene-defined transposon library screening for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in nlrc4−/− bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) demonstrates that genes clustered in the bacterial arginine metabolism pathway participate in NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. Blocking arginine uptake or putrescine export significantly relieves NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, indicating that this bacterium rewires its arginine metabolism network during infection. Moreover, intracellular E. piscicida recruits the host arginine importer (mCAT-1) and putrescine exporter (Oct-2) to bacterium-containing vacuoles, accompanied by reduced arginine and accumulated cytosolic spermine. Neutralizing E. piscicida-induced cytosolic spermine enhancement by spermine synthetase or extracellular spermine significantly alters NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Importantly, accumulated cytosolic spermine inhibits K+ efflux-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These data highlight the mechanism of bacterial gene-mediated arginine metabolism control for NLRP3 inflammasome evasion.

Abstract: Summary
Conversion of promoter-proximally paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) into elongating polymerase by the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is a central regulatory step of mRNA synthesis. The activity of P-TEFb is controlled mainly by the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which sequesters active P-TEFb into inactive 7SK/P-TEFb snRNP. Here we demonstrate that under normal culture conditions, the lack of 7SK snRNP has only minor impacts on global RNAPII transcription without detectable consequences on cell proliferation. However, upon ultraviolet (UV)-light-induced DNA damage, cells lacking 7SK have a defective transcriptional response and reduced viability. Both UV-induced release of “lesion-scanning” polymerases and activation of key early-responsive genes are compromised in the absence of 7SK. Proper induction of 7SK-dependent UV-responsive genes requires P-TEFb activity directly mobilized from the nucleoplasmic 7SK/P-TEFb snRNP. Our data demonstrate that the primary function of the 7SK/P-TEFb snRNP is to orchestrate the proper transcriptional response to stress.

Abstract: Summary
Intermittent fasting is a beneficial dietary treatment for obesity. But the response of each distinct adipose depot is currently poorly defined. Here we explore the response of key adipose depots to every-other-day fasting (EODF) in mice using proteomics. A key change in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) and visceral WAT (vWAT) depots is an increase in mitochondrial protein content after EODF. This effect is correlated with increased fatty acid synthesis enzymes in both WAT depots but not in brown adipose tissue. Strikingly, EODF treatment downregulates lipolysis specifically in vWAT, mediated by a large decrease in the abundance of the catecholamine receptor (ADRB3). Together, these changes are important for preservation of the visceral lipid store during EODF. Enrichment analysis highlights downregulation of inflammatory collagen IV specifically in vWAT, allowing improved insulin sensitivity. This resource for adipose-depot-specific fasting adaptations in mice is available using a web-based interactive visualization.

Abstract: NCLX was identified as a mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. However, contribution of NCLX to overall mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity remains unclear, especially in brain mitochondria where plasma membrane Na+-Ca2+ exchanger NCX also exists. We studied the issue using isolated mouse brain mitochondria. The Na+- as well as Li+-dependent Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria was significantly inhibited by a NCLX blocker, but was insensitive to NCX blockers, suggesting that NCLX comprises a major part in forward mode of mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. On the other hand, the Na+-dependent Ca2+ influx into mitochondria, the reverse mode, was insensitive to all the blockers tested, suggesting unidentified Ca2+ transport systems.

Abstract: Summary
Negative elongation factor (NELF) is a critical transcriptional regulator that stabilizes paused RNA polymerase to permit rapid gene expression changes in response to environmental cues. Although NELF is essential for embryonic development, its role in adult stem cells remains unclear. In this study, through a muscle-stem-cell-specific deletion, we showed that NELF is required for efficient muscle regeneration and stem cell pool replenishment. In mechanistic studies using PRO-seq, single-cell trajectory analyses and myofiber cultures revealed that NELF works at a specific stage of regeneration whereby it modulates p53 signaling to permit massive expansion of muscle progenitors. Strikingly, transplantation experiments indicated that these progenitors are also necessary for stem cell pool repopulation, implying that they are able to return to quiescence. Thus, we identified a critical role for NELF in the expansion of muscle progenitors in response to injury and revealed that progenitors returning to quiescence are major contributors to the stem cell pool repopulation.

Abstract: Successful outcomes of cell-based therapeutic is highly-dependent on quality and quantity of the cells. Epigenetic modifiers are known to modulate cell fates via reprogramming, hence it is plausible to use them in enhancing the plasticity of mesenchymal stem cells. In this study, we aimed to study the effects of 5-Azacytidine (5-AzaCR), an epigenetic modifier, pretreatment on mesenchymal stem cells-derived from Wharton's Jelly (WJMSCs) fates. WJMSCs were pretreated with 5-AzaCR for 24 h and subsequently cultured in culture media mixtures. The proliferative and stemness characteristics of the pretreated WJMSCs were assessed through morphological and gene expression analyses. Results showed that cells pretreated with 5 μM to 20 μM of 5-AzaCR showed to acquire higher proliferative state transiently when cultured in embryonic-mesenchymal stem cell (ESC-MSC) media, but not in MSC medium alone, and this coincides with significant transitional upregulation of stemness transcription factors. 5-AzaCR pretreatment has potential to confer initial induction of higher state of stemness and proliferation in WJMSCs, influenced by the culture media.

Abstract: Summary
The PI3K pathway regulates cell metabolism, proliferation, and migration, and its dysregulation is common in cancer. We now show that both physiologic and oncogenic activation of PI3K signaling increase the expression of its negative regulator PTEN. This limits the duration of the signal and output of the pathway. Physiologic and pharmacologic inhibition of the pathway reduces PTEN and contributes to the rebound in pathway activity in tumors treated with PI3K inhibitors and limits their efficacy. Regulation of PTEN is due to mTOR/4E-BP1-dependent control of its translation and is lost when 4E-BP1 is deleted. Translational regulation of PTEN is therefore a major homeostatic regulator of physiologic PI3K signaling and plays a role in reducing the pathway activation by oncogenic PIK3CA mutants and the antitumor activity of PI3K pathway inhibitors. However, pathway output is hyperactivated in tumor cells with coexistent PI3K mutation and loss of PTEN function.

Abstract: Summary
In the retina, amacrine interneurons inhibit retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrites to shape retinal output. Amacrine cells typically use either GABA or glycine to exert synaptic inhibition. Here, we combined transgenic tools with immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, and 3D electron microscopy to determine the composition and organization of inhibitory synapses across the dendritic arbor of a well-characterized RGC type in the mouse retina: the ON-sustained alpha RGC. We find mixed GABA-glycine receptor synapses across this RGC type, unveiling the existence of “mixed” inhibitory synapses in the retinal circuit. Presynaptic amacrine boutons with dual release sites are apposed to ON-sustained alpha RGC postsynapses. We further reveal the sequence of postsynaptic assembly for these mixed synapses: GABA receptors precede glycine receptors, and a lack of early GABA receptor expression impedes the recruitment of glycine receptors. Together our findings uncover the organization and developmental profile of an additional motif of inhibition in the mammalian retina.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are a poorly characterized cell population in the context of liver cancer. Our study investigates CAF functions in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a highly desmoplastic liver tumor. Genetic tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and ligand-receptor analyses uncovered hepatic stellate cells (HSC) as the main source of CAF and HSC-derived CAF as the dominant population interacting with tumor cells. In mice, CAF promotes ICC progression, as revealed by HSC-selective CAF depletion. In patients, a high panCAF signature is associated with decreased survival and increased recurrence. Single-cell RNA sequencing segregates CAF into inflammatory and growth factor-enriched (iCAF) and myofibroblastic (myCAF) subpopulations, displaying distinct ligand-receptor interactions. myCAF-expressed hyaluronan synthase 2, but not type I collagen, promotes ICC. iCAF-expressed hepatocyte growth factor enhances ICC growth via tumor-expressed MET, thus directly linking CAF to tumor cells. In summary, our data demonstrate promotion of desmoplastic ICC growth by therapeutically targetable CAF subtype-specific mediators, but not by type I collagen.

Abstract: Summary
Homology-directed repair (HDR) safeguards DNA integrity under various forms of stress, but how HDR protects replicating genomes under extensive metabolic alterations remains unclear. Here, we report that besides stalling replication forks, inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) triggers metabolic imbalance manifested by the accumulation of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cell nuclei. This leads to a redox-sensitive activation of the ATM kinase followed by phosphorylation of the MRE11 nuclease, which in HDR-deficient settings degrades stalled replication forks. Intriguingly, nascent DNA degradation by the ROS-ATM-MRE11 cascade is also triggered by hypoxia, which elevates signaling-competent ROS and attenuates functional HDR without arresting replication forks. Under these conditions, MRE11 degrades daughter-strand DNA gaps, which accumulate behind active replisomes and attract error-prone DNA polymerases to escalate mutation rates. Thus, HDR safeguards replicating genomes against metabolic assaults by restraining mutagenic repair at aberrantly processed nascent DNA. These findings have implications for cancer evolution and tumor therapy.

Abstract: Summary
Flux through the RAF-MEK-ERK protein kinase cascade is shaped by phosphatases acting on the core components of the pathway. Despite being an established drug target and a hub for crosstalk regulation, little is known about dephosphorylation of MEK, the central kinase within the cascade. Here, we identify PPP6C, a phosphatase frequently mutated or downregulated in melanoma, as a major MEK phosphatase in cells exhibiting oncogenic ERK pathway activation. Recruitment of MEK to PPP6C occurs through an interaction with its associated regulatory subunits. Loss of PPP6C causes hyperphosphorylation of MEK at activating and crosstalk phosphorylation sites, promoting signaling through the ERK pathway and decreasing sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. Recurrent melanoma-associated PPP6C mutations cause MEK hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that they promote disease at least in part by activating the core oncogenic pathway driving melanoma. Collectively, our studies identify a key negative regulator of ERK signaling that may influence susceptibility to targeted cancer therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Combining RNA sequencing, ribosome profiling, and mass spectrometry, we elucidate the contribution of non-canonical translation to the proteome and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I immunopeptidome. Remarkably, of 14,498 proteins identified in three human B cell lymphomas, 2,503 are non-canonical proteins. Of these, 28% are novel isoforms and 72% are cryptic proteins encoded by ostensibly non-coding regions (60%) or frameshifted canonical genes (12%). Cryptic proteins are translated as efficiently as canonical proteins, have more predicted disordered residues and lower stability, and critically generate MHC-I peptides 5-fold more efficiently per translation event. Translating 5′ “untranslated” regions hinders downstream translation of genes involved in transcription, translation, and antiviral responses. Novel protein isoforms show strong enrichment for signaling pathways deregulated in cancer. Only a small fraction of cryptic proteins detected in the proteome contribute to the MHC-I immunopeptidome, demonstrating the high preferential access of cryptic defective ribosomal products to the class I pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Tau accumulation is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies, but the mechanism(s) of tau aggregation remains unclear. Taking advantage of the identification of tau filament cores by cryoelectron microscopy, we demonstrate that the AD tau core possesses the intrinsic ability to spontaneously aggregate in the absence of an inducer, with antibodies generated against AD tau core filaments detecting AD tau pathology. The AD tau core also drives aggregation of full-length wild-type tau, increases seeding potential, and templates abnormal forms of tau present in brain homogenates and antemortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with AD in an ultrasensitive real-time quaking-induced conversion (QuIC) assay. Finally, we show that the filament cores in corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and Pick’s disease (PiD) similarly assemble into filaments under physiological conditions. These results document an approach to modeling tau aggregation and have significant implications for in vivo investigation of tau transmission and biomarker development.

Abstract: Summary
As in most arthropods, the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway in the vector mosquito Aedes aegypti is active in diverse biological processes in both soma and germline. To gain insights into piRNA biogenesis and effector complexes, we mapped the interactomes of the somatic PIWI proteins Ago3, Piwi4, Piwi5, and Piwi6 and identify numerous specific interactors as well as cofactors associated with multiple PIWI proteins. We describe the Piwi5 interactor AAEL014965, the direct ortholog of the Drosophila splicing factor pasilla. We find that Ae. aegypti Pasilla encodes a nuclear isoform and a cytoplasmic isoform, the latter of which is required for efficient piRNA production. In addition, we characterize a splice variant of the Tudor protein AAEL008101/Atari that associates with Ago3 and forms a scaffold for PIWI proteins and target RNAs to promote ping-pong amplification of piRNAs. Our study provides a useful resource for follow-up studies of somatic piRNA biogenesis, mechanism, and function in Aedes mosquitoes.

Abstract: Summary
Mitochondrial respiration is critical for cell proliferation. In addition to producing ATP, respiration generates biosynthetic precursors, such as aspartate, an essential substrate for nucleotide synthesis. Here, we show that in addition to depleting intracellular aspartate, electron transport chain (ETC) inhibition depletes aspartate-derived asparagine, increases ATF4 levels, and impairs mTOR complex I (mTORC1) activity. Exogenous asparagine restores proliferation, ATF4 and mTORC1 activities, and mTORC1-dependent nucleotide synthesis in the context of ETC inhibition, suggesting that asparagine communicates active respiration to ATF4 and mTORC1. Finally, we show that combination of the ETC inhibitor metformin, which limits tumor asparagine synthesis, and either asparaginase or dietary asparagine restriction, which limit tumor asparagine consumption, effectively impairs tumor growth in multiple mouse models of cancer. Because environmental asparagine is sufficient to restore tumor growth in the context of respiration impairment, our findings suggest that asparagine synthesis is a fundamental purpose of tumor mitochondrial respiration, which can be harnessed for therapeutic benefit to cancer patients.

Abstract: NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is tightly related to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and oridonin (Ori) has shown the potential to alleviate ischemia/reperfusion injury with underlying mechanisms. Our study aims to figure out whether Ori protects against the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. In this study, a temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion surgery was conducted on male C57BL/6 mice to mimic cerebral I/R injury in vivo. Cellular model of cerebral I/R in vitro was achieved by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reintroduction (OGD/R) in BV2 microglia cells. We found that Ori treatment significantly relieved the neurological deficits, neuronal injury and microglia activation in I/R mice according to morphological and histological analyses. Meanwhile, the inactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome was determined in Ori-treated mice with significantly down-regulated expressions of inflammasome-related genes. Western-blot analysis further demonstrated the negative effect of Ori on NF-κB signaling with diminished phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα as well as suppressed translocation of p65. Furthermore, we indicated that Ori suppressed the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in OGD/R induced BV2 microglia cells by inhibiting NF-κB signaling. In summary, our findings make Ori a potential candidate for therapy of cerebral I/R injury in the future.
