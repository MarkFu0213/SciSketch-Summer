Abstract: Summary
Despite recent successes of precision and immunotherapies there is a persisting need for novel targeted or multi-targeted approaches in complex diseases. Through a systems pharmacology approach, including phenotypic screening, chemical and phosphoproteomics, and RNA-seq, we elucidated the targets and mechanisms underlying the differential anticancer activity of two structurally related multi-kinase inhibitors, foretinib, and cabozantinib, in lung cancer cells. Biochemical and cellular target validation using probe molecules and RNAi revealed a polypharmacology mechanism involving MEK1/2, FER, and AURKB, which were each more potently inhibited by foretinib than cabozantinib. Based on this, we developed a synergistic combination of foretinib with barasertib, a more potent AURKB inhibitor, for MYC-amplified small-cell lung cancer. This systems pharmacology approach showed that small structural changes of drugs can cumulatively, through multiple targets, result in pronounced anticancer activity differences and that detailed mechanistic understanding of polypharmacology can enable repurposing opportunities for cancers with unmet medical need.

Abstract: Summary
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a common form of interstitial lung disease resulting in alveolar remodeling and progressive loss of pulmonary function because of chronic alveolar injury and failure to regenerate the respiratory epithelium. Histologically, fibrotic lesions and honeycomb structures expressing atypical proximal airway epithelial markers replace alveolar structures, the latter normally lined by alveolar type 1 (AT1) and AT2 cells. Bronchial epithelial stem cells (BESCs) can give rise to AT2 and AT1 cells or honeycomb cysts following bleomycin-mediated lung injury. However, little is known about what controls this binary decision or whether this decision can be reversed. Here we report that inactivation of Fgfr2b in BESCs impairs their contribution to both alveolar epithelial regeneration and honeycomb cysts after bleomycin injury. By contrast overexpression of Fgf10 in BESCs enhances fibrosis resolution by favoring the more desirable outcome of alveolar epithelial regeneration over the development of pathologic honeycomb cysts.

Abstract: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play critical roles in tumor progression. However, the role and mechanism underlying CAFs in esophageal cancer (EC) remain unclear. In this study, primary CAFs and normal esophageal fibroblasts (NOFs) were isolated and characterized by immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and western blot. Clinical significance of twist1 in CAFs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry assay. Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from CAFs to evaluate the influence on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of EC cells. EC cells were mixed with CAFs and subcutaneously injected into nude mice to assess the in vivo tumor growth. As the result, twist1 was overexpressed in CAFs compared with NOFs and exhibited adverse prognostic significance. In CAFs, twist1 promoted the expression and secretion of CXCL12. In EC cells, activated CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling promoted the EMT process through ERK/AKT - twist1 - MMP1/E-cadherin pathway. In addition, knockdown of twist1 in CAFs also suppressed in vivo tumor growth. In conclusion, our results revealed a dual role of twist1 in CAFs and EC cells to promote the EMT process.

Abstract: Tumor-derived exosomes contain informative microRNAs involved in carcinogenesis, cell migration, invasion and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), eventually contributing to metastasis of cancers. This study aims to clarify which and how exosomal miRNA affects tumor carcinogenesis and metastasis. Among them, miR-499a-5p was upregulated in both highly metastatic lung cancer cell line and their exosomes. MiR-499a-5p overexpression promoted cell proliferation, migration and EMT, while miR-499a-5p knockdown suppressed these processes in vitro. Inhibition of miR-499a-5p by antagomirs administration restrained tumor growth in vivo. Consequently, miR499a-sufficient exosomes, derived from highly metastatic cell line, enhanced cell proliferation, migration and EMT via mTOR pathway, and the effect could be inhibited by miR-499a-5p inhibitor. The study reveals the potential diagnostic and therapeutic value of cancer-derived exosomal miR-499a-5p, and sheds a new insight on a novel molecular mechanism which modulates metastasis.

Abstract: Summary
Common approaches to antibiotic discovery include small-molecule screens for growth inhibition in target pathogens and screens for inhibitors of purified enzymes. These approaches have a shared intent of seeking to directly target a vital Achilles heel in a pathogen of interest. Here, we report the first screen against a sporulation pathway in a non-pathogenic bacterium as a means of discovering novel antibiotics—this effort has resulted in two important discoveries. First, we show that the sporulation program of Streptomyces venezuelae is exquisitely sensitive to numerous forms of DNA damage. Second, we have identified a DNA gyrase inhibitor. This molecule, EN-7, is active against pathogenic species that are resistant to ciprofloxacin and other clinically important antibiotics. We suggest that this strategy could be applied to other morphogenetic pathways in prokaryotes or eukaryotes as a means of identifying novel chemical matter having scientific and clinical utility.

Abstract: Accumulating reports suggest that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in the progression of many tumors. In this study, we explored the expression level of lncRNA FOXD2-AS1 in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The data indicated that FOXD2-AS1 expression was increased in HCC specimens and cell lines. Furthermore, aberrant expression was correlated with tumor number and tumor size in HCC patients. Silencing FOXD2-AS1 arrest cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, inhibited colony formation, cell proliferation and suppressed the in vivo growth of subcutaneous tumors. Our results revealed that FOXD2-AS1 could epigenetically silence CDKN1B by recruiting EZH2 to CDKN1B promoter region. Knocking down CDKN1B could restore the carcinogenic effect of FOXD2-AS1 on HCC. Collectively, our data suggested that FOXD2-AS1 could be new target for therapies or prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abstract: The expression of HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) plays a major role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the function of HAX-1 in HCC metastasis is unclear. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were used to examine HAX-1 expression in HCC cell lines with different metastatic potential, and in tumor tissues with or without intrahepatic metastasis. HCC tissue arrays (n = 144) were used to assess correlations between clinicopathological parameters and HAX-1 expression. We also examined the effect of HAX-1 on promoting HCC cell metastasis in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that the expression levels of HAX-1 were higher in metastatic HCC cell lines than in non-metastatic HCC cell lines. HAX-1 was also significantly upregulated in primary HCC tissues with intrahepatic metastasis compared with those without intrahepatic metastasis. HCC in patients with high HAX-1 expression is more likely to metastasize. HAX-1 expression was associated with malignant progression and poor prognosis, and HAX1 silencing inhibited HCC cell migration and invasion in vitro and decreased HCC cell lung metastasis in vivo, whereas HAX-1 overexpression had the inverse effect. Moreover, HAX-1 increased HCC cell metastasis by promoting the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Finally, we revealed that HAX-1 modulated EMT in HCC cells by increasing NF-κB/p65 nuclear translocation. In conclusion, HAX-1 promotes HCC metastasis by EMT through activating the NF-κB pathway, suggesting that HAX-1 could be a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to investigate the functional role of Rab39a in human cervical cancer (CC) and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We first measured Rab39a mRNA expression in CC tissues and paired non-tumor tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). Overall survival of CC patients with different mRNA levels of Rab39a in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves analysis. Next methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed to determine the expression mechanism of Rab39a. Then cell proliferation, migration and invasion of Rab39a-transfected or mock-transfected cervical cancer cells were determined by CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing, transwell migration and invasion assays, respectively. Finally, the molecular mechanism by which Rab39a modulated CC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was explored. It was found that Rab39a mRNA was significantly down-regulated in the high-risk patients compared to the low-risk patients (p = 0.0054). Six of seven cancer tissues with lymph node metastasis express low Rab39a mRNA compared to the surrounding non-tumor tissues. Cervical cancer patients with low level of Rab39a were showed a poorly clinical outcome (p = 0.004). Loss of Rab39a expression in cervical cancer tissues was associated with the aberrant DNA methylation in the promoter of Rab39a gene. Disrupted Rab39a expression in cervical cancer cells could be restored after treatment with the demethylated agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Furthermore, it was found that Rab39a hardly influenced cell growth but significantly suppressed cell migration, invasion and EMT process. Rab39a exerted its potential suppressor functions through inhibiting AKT phosphorylation. The inhibition effects of Rab39a could be blocked by AKT pathway inhibitor. Collectively, our data shows that Rab39a is a potential epigenetic silenced tumor suppressor inhibiting cancer invasion and migration through modulating the AKT signaling.

Abstract: Summary
The initiation and execution of cell death can be regulated by various lipids. How the levels of environmental (exogenous) lipids impact cell death sensitivity is not well understood. We find that exogenous monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) potently inhibit the non-apoptotic, iron-dependent, oxidative cell death process of ferroptosis. This protective effect is associated with the suppression of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation at the plasma membrane and decreased levels of phospholipids containing oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids. Treatment with exogenous MUFAs reduces the sensitivity of plasma membrane lipids to oxidation over several hours. This effect requires MUFA activation by acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long-chain family member 3 (ACSL3) and is independent of lipid droplet formation. Exogenous MUFAs also protect cells from apoptotic lipotoxicity caused by the accumulation of saturated fatty acids, but in an ACSL3-independent manner. Our work demonstrates that ACSL3-dependent MUFA activation promotes a ferroptosis-resistant cell state.

Abstract: Vascular inflammation is a complex and multifactorial pathophysiological process that plays a crucial role in all stages of syphilis and is responsible for tissue damage. Little is known about the interactions of infiltrating immunocytes with human dermal vascular smooth muscle cells (HDVSMCs) in arterioles during the immunopathogenesis of syphilis. The Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum membrane protein Tp47 is considered a major inducer of inflammation initiation and development. In this study, we demonstrated that Tp47 promoted the migration and adhesion of THP-1 cells to HDVSMCs. Furthermore, Tp47 increased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mRNA and protein expression levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The migration and adhesion of THP-1 cells to HDVSMCs were significantly suppressed by anti-MCP-1 and anti-ICAM-1 neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Further studies revealed that treatment of HDVSMCs with Tp47 activated the PI3K/Akt, p38 MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt, p38 MAPK and NF-κB suppressed the MCP-1 and ICAM-1 expression induced by Tp47. In addition, the migration and adhesion of THP-1 cells to Tp47-treated HDVSMCs were significantly decreased by pretreatment with PI3K/Akt, p38 MAPK and NF-κB inhibitors. These findings demonstrate that Tp47 promotes the migration and adherence of THP-1 cells to HDVSMCs by inducing MCP-1 and ICAM-1 expression, which is mediated by activation of the PI3K/Akt, p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways. This study provides a novel potential therapeutic strategy for controlling the vascular inflammatory response in syphilis patients.

Abstract: Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia (glycolipotoxicity)-triggered islet β-cell dysfunction is known to drive the progression of obesity-related type 2 diabetes, however the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. The current study aimed to investigate the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 5 (MKP-5) in islet cells under glucolipotoxic conditions. Using gene overexpression and knockdown approaches, we demonstrated that MKP-5 could alleviate glucolipotoxicity-induced apoptosis via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial apoptosis pathways owing to the altered regulation of caspase family members and ER stress-related molecules in MIN6 and primary islet cells. Overexpression of MKP-5 reversed the glucose and palmitic acid (GP)-induced impairment of insulin secretion as well as the abnormal decreases in the expression of islet functional genes, thereby maintaining the normal insulin secretory functionality, whereas the absence of MKP-5 aggravated islet cell dysfunction. In parallel, the production of ROS and increased inflammation-associated genes in response to GP were also reduced upon MKP-5 overexpression. Further, inhibition of JNK or P38 MAPK pathways resisted to glucolipotoxicity observed in MKP-5 knockdown MIN6 cells. These findings indicate that MKP-5 is an important mediator for glucolipotoxicity-induced islet cell dysfunction and apoptosis, with JNK and P38 as the critical downstream pathways.

Long noncoding RNA CCAT2 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation and metastasis through up-regulation of NDRG1,

Abstract: Background
Emerging studies demonstrate that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in hepatocarcinogenesis through various mechanisms. LncRNA CCAT2 was a newly discovered lncRNA and amplified in several cancers. However, the mechanisms involved in function of CCAT2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain to be explored.
Methods
CCAT2 expressions in HCC tissues and cell lines were measured by RT-qPCR. MTS assay, colony formation assay, wound-healing assay and transwell assay were used to explore the biological functions of CCAT2 on HCC cells proliferation and metastasis. Experiments in vivo were carried out to confirm these effects. The underlying mechanisms were analyzed by western blot and dual-luciferase reporter assay.
Results
In this study, we found that CCAT2 were significantly elevated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and it promoted HCC cells proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we identified that NDRG1 was a downstream target of CCAT2. Meanwhile, depletion of CCAT2 inhibited cellular proliferation and metastasis behaviors induced by NDRG1- overexpression. Analysis of mechanism underlying these effects revealed that CCAT2 increased the expression of NDRG1 by enhancing its promoter activity. Furthermore, the active region between CCAT2 and NDRG1 promoter was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay.
Conclusions
All these observations demonstrate that CCAT2 acts as an oncogene by up-regulating NDRG1, which may have the potential to be used as a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.

Abstract: Summary
Necroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death executed through plasma membrane rupture by the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). We previously showed that MLKL activation requires metabolites of the inositol phosphate (IP) pathway. Here we reveal that I(1,3,4,6)P4, I(1,3,4,5,6)P5, and IP6 promote membrane permeabilization by MLKL through directly binding the N-terminal executioner domain (NED) and dissociating its auto-inhibitory region. We show that IP6 and inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPPK) are required for necroptosis as IPPK deletion ablated IP6 production and inhibited necroptosis. The NED auto-inhibitory region is more extensive than originally described and single amino acid substitutions along this region induce spontaneous necroptosis by MLKL. Activating IPs bind three sites with affinity of 100–600 μM to destabilize contacts between the auto-inhibitory region and NED, thereby promoting MLKL activation. We therefore uncover MLKL's activating switch in NED triggered by a select repertoire of IP metabolites.

Abstract: NEDD4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing the HECT domain, which regulates various cellular processes, but its role in vascular endothelial cells is unknown. In the present study, we found that NEDD4 bound directly to XPO1 by co-immunoprecipitation screening. In HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), overexpression of NEDD4 reduced Ang II-induced ROS level and cell apoptosis. Ang II stimulation led to nuclear accumulation of cargoes, while overexpression of NEDD4 enhanced the XPO1-dependent nuclear export of its cargoes. KPT185, an inhibitor of XPO1, can abolished the protective effect of NEDD4 under Ang II treatment. In addition, NEDD4 could promote the interaction between XPO1 and RanBP3 via K63-linked ubiquitination of XPO1. These results suggested that NEDD4 played a protective role in vascular endothelial cell injury through regulating XPO1-mediated nuclear export.

Abstract: Summary
Vitamin A deficiency increases susceptibility to skin infection. However, the mechanisms by which vitamin A regulates skin immunity remain unclear. Here, we show that resistin-like molecule α (RELMα), a small secreted cysteine-rich protein, is expressed by epidermal keratinocytes and sebocytes and serves as an antimicrobial protein that is required for vitamin-A-dependent resistance to skin infection. RELMα was induced by microbiota colonization of the murine skin, was bactericidal in vitro, and was protected against bacterial infection of the skin in vivo. RELMα expression required dietary vitamin A and was induced by the therapeutic vitamin A analog isotretinoin, which protected against skin infection in a RELMα-dependent manner. The RELM family member Resistin was expressed in human skin, was induced by vitamin A analogs, and killed skin bacteria, indicating a conserved function for RELM proteins in skin innate immunity. Our findings provide insight into how vitamin A promotes resistance to skin infection.

Abstract: Summary
Cysteine persulfide and cysteine polysulfides are cysteine derivatives having sulfane sulfur atoms bound to cysteine thiol. Accumulating evidence has suggested that cysteine persulfides/polysulfides are abundant in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and play important roles in diverse biological processes such as antioxidant host defense and redox-dependent signal transduction. Here, we show that enhancement of cellular polysulfides by using polysulfide donors developed in this study resulted in marked inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-initiated macrophage activation. Polysulfide donor treatment strongly suppressed LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages by inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Other TLR signaling stimulants—including zymosan A-TLR2 and poly(I:C)-TLR3—were also significantly suppressed by polysulfur donor treatment. Administration of polysulfide donors protected mice from lethal endotoxin shock. These data indicate that cellular polysulfides negatively regulate TLR4-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling and hence constitute a potential target for inflammatory disorders.

Abstract: Summary
Probiotics are living microorganisms that are increasingly used as gastrointestinal therapeutics by virtue of their innate or engineered genetic function. Unlike abiotic therapeutics, probiotics can replicate in their intended site, subjecting their genomes and therapeutic properties to natural selection. We exposed the candidate probiotic E. coli Nissle (EcN) to the mouse gastrointestinal tract over several weeks, systematically altering the diet and background microbiota complexity. In-transit EcN accumulates genetic mutations that modulate carbohydrate utilization, stress response, and adhesion to gain competitive fitness, while previous exposure to antibiotics reveals an acquisition of resistance. We then leveraged these insights to generate an EcN strain that shows therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model of phenylketonuria and found that it was genetically stable over 1 week, thereby validating EcN’s utility as a chassis for engineering. Collectively, we demonstrate a generalizable pipeline that can be applied to other probiotics to better understand their safety and engineering potential.

Abstract: M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs) infiltrating the tumor microenvironment contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. It was reported that cancer cells undergoing EMT will acquire stemness characteristics. Here, the HCC SMMC-7721 cell line was co-cultured with M2-TAMs polarized from THP-1 cells in vitro. In in vivo studies, we used nude mice subcutaneous tumor model to test whether the growth of the tumor was affected by M2-TAMs. Subsequently, EMT, stemness and Wnt/β-catenin pathway related markers were detected in cells and subcutaneous tumor tissues. TNF-α was also assessed in both the co-culture system supernatants and in nude mice serum. We found that SMMC-7721 underwent EMT and acquired stemness after co-culture with M2-TAMs, and resulted in larger tumor size following subcutaneous injection of SMMC-7721 suspended in M2-TAMs supernatants compared with SMMC-7721 alone. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay showed that TNF-α expression was elevated in supernatants of M2-TAMs and positively correlated with tumor size in the serum of nude mice. Furthermore, we found that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was a downstream target of TNF-α and that the Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor ICG-001 partially reversed EMT and attenuated cancer stemness. Our results indicate that TNF-α derived from M2-TAMs promote EMT and cancer stemness cells via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Integrins, which bind laminin, a major component of the mammary basement membrane, are strongly expressed in basal stem cell-enriched populations, but their role in controlling mammary stem cell function remains unclear. We found that stem cell activity, as evaluated in transplantation and mammosphere assays, was reduced in mammary basal cells depleted of laminin receptors containing α3- and α6-integrin subunits. This was accompanied by low MDM2 levels, p53 stabilization, and diminished proliferative capacity. Importantly, disruption of p53 function restored the clonogenicity of α3/α6-integrin-depleted mammary basal stem cells, while inhibition of RHO or myosin II, leading to decreased p53 activity, rescued the mammosphere formation. These data suggest that α3/α6-integrin-mediated adhesion plays an essential role in controlling the proliferative potential of mammary basal stem/progenitor cells through myosin II-mediated regulation of p53 and indicate that laminins might be important components of the mammary stem cell niche.

Abstract: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is important in various cellular processes including mitochondrial homeostasis and mutations in this gene lead to Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the full spectrum of LRRK2's functions remain to be elucidated. The translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex is essential for the import of almost all nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins and is fundamental for cellular survival. Using co-immunoprecipitation, super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM), and 3D virtual reality (VR) assisted co-localization analysis techniques we show that wild-type and mutant (G2019S) LRRK2 associate and co-localize with subunits of the TOM complex, either under basal (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) or stress-induced (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine, CCCP) conditions. Interestingly, LRRK2 interacted with TOM40 under both DMSO and CCCP conditions, and when the PD causing mutation, G2019S was introduced, the association was not altered. Moreover, overexpression of G2019S LRRK2 resulted in the formation of large, perinuclear aggregates that co-localized with the TOM complex. Taken together, this is the first study to show that both WT and mutant LRRK2 associate with the TOM complex subunits. These findings provide additional evidence for LRRK2's role in mitochondrial function which has important implications for its role in PD pathogenesis.

Abstract: The small GTPases Rab11a and 11b are key regulators of membrane transport, localised to the recycling endosomes and also early endosomes. The function of Rab11 within the recycling pathway has been well defined, however, the role of Rab11 at the early endosomes remains poorly characterised. Here, we have generated HeLa cell lines devoid of either Rab11a or Rab11b using CRISPR/Cas9 to functionally dissect the roles of these two Rab11 family members in recycling and in the endosomal-lysosomal system. Both Rab11a and Rab11b contribute to the dynamics of tubulation arising from recycling endosomes whereas Rab11a has the major role in recycling of transferrin receptor. Deletion of either Rab11a or Rab11b resulted in the formation of enlarged early endosomes and perturbation of the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Strikingly, Rab11a knock-out cells showed an increased density of functional late endosomes/lysosomes as well as lysotracker-positive organelles which were primarily concentrated in a perinuclear location, indicating that the homeostasis of the endosome/lysosome pathway had been perturbed. Moreover, in Rab11a knockout cells there was a functional defect in the intracellular recycling of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) between the late endosomes and the TGN, a defect associated with enhanced degradation of CI-M6PR. Expression of wild-type Rab11a in Rab11a knockout cells rescued the late endosome/lysosome phenotype. Overall, these results indicate that Rab11a and Rab11b have overlapping and distinct functions and that Rab11a, unexpectedly, plays a central role in the homeostasis of endosomal-lysosomal biogenesis.

Abstract: Stem cells can divide asymmetrically with respect to cell fate, producing a copy of themselves (self-renewal), while giving rise to progeny that will differentiate along a specific lineage. Mechanisms that bias the balance towards self-renewal or extend the proliferative capacity of the differentiating progeny can result in tissue overgrowth and, eventually, the formation of tumors. Recent work has explored the role of heterochromatin and heterochromatin-associated proteins in the regulation of stem cell behavior under homeostatic conditions, but less is known about their possible roles in potentiating or suppressing stem cell overproliferation. Here we used ectopic activation of the Jak/STAT pathway in germline and somatic stem cells of the D. melanogaster testis as an in vivo model to probe the function of Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) in stem cell overproliferation. Forced expression of HP1 in either early germ or somatic cells suppressed the overgrowth of testes in response to ectopic Jak/STAT activation. Interestingly, HP1 expression led to distinct phenotypes, depending on whether it was overexpressed in somatic or germ cells, possibly reflecting different cell-autonomous and non-autonomous effects in each cell type. Our results provide a new framework for further in vivo studies aimed at understanding the interactions between heterochromatin and uncontrolled stem cell proliferation, as well as the complex cross-regulatory interactions between the somatic and germline lineages in the Drosophila testis.

Abstract: Galectins are β-galactoside binding proteins which possess a variety of functions including modulation of apoptosis, growth and differentiation. Hence, alterations in the expression profile have been associated with loss of cellular homeostasis contributing to tumor growth and progression. Though galectin-12 is significantly downregulated in several tumor entities, including colon cancer, its impact on cellular homeostasis as well as galectin-12 specific binding partners have not been identified so far. We therefore established an experimental strategy which is based on reversible cross-link immunoprecipitation to capture the galectin-12 protein interactome in colon cancer cells. By applying this approach, we identified 10 novel candidates of galectin-12 interacting proteins including the neutral amino acid exchanger SLC1A5. Remarkably, we uncovered that binding of galectin-12 to SLC1A5 significantly reduced glutamine uptake in our model cell line. Consequently, utilization of glutamine carbon for biomass synthesis was profoundly affected, suggesting galectin-12 as a novel inhibitor of glutamine anaplerosis in colon cancer cells. More detailed analysis revealed that colon cancer cells can counteract galectin-12 mediated glutamine deprivation by induction of compensatory mechanisms which facilitate adaption to low-glutamine conditions and thus survival.

Abstract: Summary
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a tumor predisposition genetic disease caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene. Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign Schwann cell (SC) tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath that develop through NF1 inactivation and can progress toward a malignant soft tissue sarcoma. There is a lack of non-perishable model systems to investigate PNF development. We reprogrammed PNF-derived NF1(−/−) cells, descendants from the tumor originating cell. These NF1(−/−)-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) captured the genomic status of PNFs and were able to differentiate toward neural crest stem cells and further to SCs. iPSC-derived NF1(−/−) SCs exhibited a continuous high proliferation rate, poor myelination ability, and a tendency to form 3D spheres that expressed the same markers as their PNF-derived primary SC counterparts. They represent a valuable model to study and treat PNFs. PNF-derived iPSC lines were banked for making them available.

Abstract: Ginkgolide terpenoid lactones, including ginkgolides and bilobalide, are two crucial bioactive constituents of extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb) which was used in the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The aims of this study were to investigate the antioxidant effects and mechanism of ginkgolides (ginkgolide A (GA), ginkgolide B (GB), ginkgolide K (GK)) and bilobalide (BB) against oxidative stress induced by transient focal cerebral ischemia. In vitro, SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 4 h followed by reoxygenation with ginkgolides and BB treatments for 6 h, and then cell viability, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ROS were respectively detected using kit. Western blot was used to confirm the protein levels of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), quinone oxidoreductase l (Nqo1), Akt, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), nuclear factor-E2-related factor2 (Nrf2), and phosphorylated Nrf2 (p-Nrf2). GB combined with different concentrations of LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) were administrated to SH-SY5Y cells for 1 h after OGD, and then p-Akt and p-Nrf2 levels were detected by western blot. In vivo, 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established, followed with reperfusion and GB treatments for 24 and 72 h. The infarct volume ratios were confirmed by TTC staining. The protein levels of HO-1, Nqo1, SOD1, Akt, p-Akt, Nrf2, and p-Nrf2 were detected using western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Experimental data in vitro confirm that GA, GB, GK, and BB resulted in significant decrease of ROS and increase of SOD activities and protein levels of HO-1 and Nqo1; however, GB group had a significant advantage in comparison with the GA and GK groups. Moreover, after ginkgolides and BB treatments, p-Akt and p-Nrf2 were significantly upregulated, which could be inhibited by LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner, meanwhile, GB exhibited more effective than GA and GK. In vivo, TTC staining indicated that the infarct volume ratios in MCAO rats were dramatically decreased by GB in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GB significantly upregulated the protein levels of HO-1, Nqo1, SOD, p-Akt, p-Nrf2, and Nrf2. In conclusion, GA, GB, GK, and BB significantly inhibited oxidative stress damage caused by cerebral ischemia reperfusion. Compared with GA, GK, and BB, GB exerts the strongest antioxidant stress effects against ischemic stroke. Moreover, ginkgolides and BB upregulated the levels of antioxidant proteins through mediating the Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway to protect neurons from oxidative stress injury.

Abstract: Summary
Eliciting HIV-1-specific broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) remains a challenge for vaccine development, and the potential of passively delivered bNAbs for prophylaxis and therapeutics is being explored. We used neutralization data from four large virus panels to comprehensively map viral signatures associated with bNAb sensitivity, including amino acids, hypervariable region characteristics, and clade effects across four different classes of bNAbs. The bNAb signatures defined for the variable loop 2 (V2) epitope region of HIV-1 Env were then employed to inform immunogen design in a proof-of-concept exploration of signature-based epitope targeted (SET) vaccines. V2 bNAb signature-guided mutations were introduced into Env 459C to create a trivalent vaccine, and immunization of guinea pigs with V2-SET vaccines resulted in increased breadth of NAb responses compared with Env 459C alone. These data demonstrate that bNAb signatures can be utilized to engineer HIV-1 Env vaccine immunogens capable of eliciting antibody responses with greater neutralization breadth.

Abstract: Summary
Western lifestyle is linked to autoimmune and metabolic diseases, driven by changes in diet and gut microbiota composition. Using Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)-dependent mouse models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we dissect dietary effects on the gut microbiota and find that Lactobacillus reuteri can drive autoimmunity but is ameliorated by dietary resistant starch (RS). Culture of internal organs and 16S rDNA sequencing revealed TLR7-dependent translocation of L. reuteri in mice and fecal enrichment of Lactobacillus in a subset of SLE patients. L. reuteri colonization worsened autoimmune manifestations under specific-pathogen-free and gnotobiotic conditions, notably increasing plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and interferon signaling. However, RS suppressed the abundance and translocation of L. reuteri via short-chain fatty acids, which inhibited its growth. Additionally, RS decreased pDCs, interferon pathways, organ involvement, and mortality. Thus, RS exerts beneficial effects in lupus-prone hosts through suppressing a pathobiont that promotes interferon pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of human autoimmunity.

Abstract: Summary
Nurr1, a nuclear receptor essential for the development, maintenance, and survival of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, is a potential therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder characterized by the degeneration of these same neurons. Efforts to identify Nurr1 agonists have been hampered by the recognition that it lacks several classic regulatory elements of nuclear receptor function, including the canonical ligand-binding pocket. Here we report that the dopamine metabolite 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) binds directly to and modulates the activity of Nurr1. Using biophysical assays and X-ray crystallography, we show that DHI binds to the ligand-binding domain within a non-canonical pocket, forming a covalent adduct with Cys566. In cultured cells and zebrafish, DHI stimulates Nurr1 activity, including the transcription of target genes underlying dopamine homeostasis. These findings suggest avenues for developing synthetic Nurr1 ligands to ameliorate the symptoms and progression of Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the surveillance of malignant cells. The engagement of NK group 2 member D (NKG2D) receptor with its ligands on target cells represents a promising therapeutic strategy against cancers. Here, we report that parvifoline AA (PAA), a natural ent-kaurane diterpenoid, markedly stimulates the expression of NKG2D ligands on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, considerably enhancing their recognition and lysis by NK cells. We determined that PAA covalently binds to the conserved cysteine site of peroxiredoxins I/II (Prxs-I/II) and inhibits their catalytic activity, subsequently activating the ROS/ERK axis and the immunogenicity of HCC toward NK cells. Robust tumor growth inhibition by PAA dependent on NK cell activation was detected in vivo. Our data suggest Prxs-I/II as a promising cancer immune therapeutic target and provide a compelling rationale for further development of the inhibitor PAA as a sensitizer agent for NK cell-mediated HCC immunotherapy.

Abstract: Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the most common and malignant types of primary brain tumors in adults, with a dismal prognosis. Although alkylating agents such as temozolomide are widely applied as the first-line treatment for GBM, they often cause chemoresistance and remain ineffective with recurrent GBM. Alternative therapeutics against GBM are urgently needed in the clinic. We report herein the discovery of a class of inhibitors (YZ129 and its derivatives) of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway that exhibited potent anti-tumor activity against GBM. YZ129-induced GBM cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase promoted apoptosis and inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration. At the molecular level, YZ129 directly engaged HSP90 to antagonize its chaperoning effect on calcineurin to abrogate NFAT nuclear translocation, and also suppressed other proto-oncogenic pathways including hypoxia, glycolysis, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis. Our data highlight the potential for targeting the cancer-promoting HSP90 chaperone network to treat GBM.

Abstract: Telomerase-deficient cells of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae experience progressive telomere shortening and undergo senescence in a manner similar to that seen in cultured human fibroblasts. The cells exhibit a DNA damage checkpoint-like stress response, undergo changes in size and morphology, and eventually stop dividing. In this study, a new assay is described that allowed quantitation of senescence in telomerase-deficient est2 cells with applied statistics. Use of the new technique revealed that senescence was strongly accelerated in est2 mutants that had homologous recombination genes RAD51, RAD52 or RAD54 co-inactivated, but was only modestly affected when RAD55, RAD57 or RAD59 were knocked out. Additionally, a new approach for calculating population doublings indicated that loss of growth capacity occurred after approximately 64 generations in est2 cells but only 42 generations in est2 rad52 cells. Phase contrast microscopy experiments demonstrated that senescing est2 cells became enlarged in a time-dependent manner, ultimately exhibiting a 60% increase in cell size. Progressive alterations in physical properties were also observed, including striking changes in light scattering characteristics and cellular sedimentation rates. The results described herein will facilitate future studies of genetic and environmental factors that affect telomere shortening-associated cell senescence rates using the yeast model system.

Abstract: We performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on control and TGF-β1-exposed rat lung fibroblasts to identify proteins differentially expressed between cell populations. A total of 196 proteins were found to be differentially expressed in response to TGF-β1 treatment. Guided by these results, we next determined whether similar changes in protein expression were detectable in the rat lung after chronic exposure to silica dust. Of the five proteins selected for further analysis, we found that levels of all proteins were markedly increased in the silica-exposed rat lung, including the proteins for the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and the transmembrane (type I) heparin sulfate proteoglycan called syndecan 2 (SDC2). Because VLDLR and SDC2 have not, to our knowledge, been previously linked to the pathobiology of silicosis, we next examined whether knockdown of either gene altered responses to TGF-β1 in MRC-5 lung fibroblasts. Interestingly, we found knockdown of either VLDLR or SDC2 dramatically reduced collagen production to TGF-β1, suggesting that both proteins might play a novel role in myofibroblast biology and pathogenesis of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In summary, our findings suggest that performing LC-MS/MS on TGF-β1 stimulated lung fibroblasts can uncover novel molecular targets of activated myofibroblasts in silica-exposed lung.

Abstract: The nuclear pore membrane protein 121 (POM121) was originally thought to be a constitutive protein of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). In addition to being involved in NPC assembly, abnormal POM121 expression has been found to be associated with many diseases. In this study, we explored, in detail, the effect of POM121 on the macrophage inflammatory response and found that its expression was significantly lower in LPS-stimulated macrophages, substantially amplifying pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α and IL-6) production, suggesting that POM121 exerts a potent inhibitory effect on macrophage inflammation. Consistent with this notion, greater susceptibility to LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) as well as more severe tissue inflammation were found in POM121fl/fl Lyzm-Cre+ mice compared to those in control mice, as evidenced by the more severe lung injury and inflammation, increased TNF-α and IL-6 production and more abundant proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). This inflammation-modulating effect of POM121 relied on its ability to repress the NF-κB signal pathway via inhibition of phosphorylated P65 (phos-P65) nuclear accumulation. In the present study, we reported that in addition to acting as a constitutive NPC component, POM121 also modulated LPS-induced macrophage inflammation via repressing nuclear P65 translocation. Our study may pave the way for regulating LPS-induced massive macrophage inflammation and providing evidence for the functional diversity of nucleoporins (Nups).

Abstract: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contribute to metastasis. As shown in our previous studies, interleukin-6 (IL-6) induces ATM phosphorylation to increase MMP expression and metastasis in lung cancer. However, the exact roles of ATM activation in the IL-6-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and lung cancer metastasis are currently unclear. Here, ATM phosphorylation exerts its pro-metastatic effect via vimentin-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which was supported by the evidence described below. Firstly, IL-6 treatment increases vimentin expression via the ATM-NF-κB pathway. Second, ATM inactivation not only abolishes IL-6-induced increases in vimentin expression but also inhibits IL-6-induced nest formation in a xenograft lung metastasis model. Moreover, close positive correlations were observed between ATM phosphorylation and vimentin upregulation, IL-6 levels and metastasis in lung cancer specimens. Hence, ATM modulates vimentin expression to facilitate IL-6-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in lung cancer, indicating that ATM and vimentin might be potential therapeutic targets for inflammation-associated lung cancer metastasis.

Abstract: Endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) is a key step during lung fibrosis. Studies have shown that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) may act as therapeutic candidates for lung fibrosis. However, the effects of BMSCs on EndoMT induced by SiO2 have not been elucidated, and means to label and track grafted cells have been lacking. The current study explored whether BMSCs prevented pulmonary fibrosis by targeting EndoMT, as well as analyzed the distribution of BMSCs labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles during treatment. TIE2-GFP mice, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and BMSCs labeled with SPIO nanoparticles were used to explore the distributions and therapeutic effects of BMSCs in vivo and in vitro. We found that BMSCs reversed lung fibrosis by targeting EndoMT in vivo. Furthermore, we show that BMSCs labeled with SPIO nanoparticles could be used to track stem cells reliably in the lungs for 14 days. Conditioned medium from BMSCs attenuated the increased functional changes and reversed the SiO2-induced upregulation of ER stress and autophagy markers irrespective of whether they were nanoparticle labeled or not. Our findings identify novel methods to track labeled BMSCs with therapeutic potential.

Abstract: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is a noninvasive therapeutic method which gradually being used in clinic including cancers. Exosomes mediate intercellular communication functions in disease development and the potential clinical applications in diagnosis and therapy. However, few studies have discussed the relationship between LIPUS and exosomes. Herein, we show that low intensity (0.6–2.1 W/cm2 or 0.6–3.4 W/cm2) LIPUS promoted exosomes secretion whereas higher intensity (3.4–5.0 W/cm2 or 5.0 W/cm2) LIPUS inhibited exosomes secretion, and this phenomenon is associated with autophagy. Pretreatment with 3-MA or down-regulation of LC3 potentiated low intensity LIPUS's promotion of exosomes secretion and conferred resistance to higher intensity LIPUS's effects on exosomes secretion. Furthermore, pretreatment with PP242 attenuated LIPUS-influenced exosomes secretion while expression of constitutively active Akt (Ad-myr-Akt) elevated LIPUS-influenced exosomes secretion, implying mTOR-dependent mechanism involved. The findings indicate that LIPUS influences exosomes secretion by targeting mTOR-mediated LC3 signaling in SPC-A1 and SPC-A1-BM cells. Our data provided initial evidence to connect LIPUS and secretion of exosomes, and highlight that LIPUS may be exploited in exosome-related diseases.

Abstract: Glutamine metabolism is an important metabolic pathway for cancer cell survival, and there is a critical connection between tumor growth and glutamine metabolism. However, the role of GLS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remains to be elucidated. In this study, we reported that GLS1 expression was significantly increased in HCC tissues and correlated with serum AFP, tumor differentiation, lymphatic metastasis, TNM stage, and poorer patient outcome. We further showed that GLS1 promoted colony formation and cell proliferation of HCC cells. Furthermore, our data showed that GLS1 inhibitor compound 968 inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, we found that GLS1 overexpression increased p-AKT, p-GSK3β and cyclinD1 expression, and had no influence on total AKT and GSK3β protein level, indicating that GLS1 was involved in AKT/GSK3β/CyclinD1 pathway. It is suggested that GLS1 promotes proliferation in HCC cells probably via AKT/GSK3β/CyclinD1 pathway and may be a potential target for anti-hepatocellular carcinoma cancer.

Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease and hard to cure at present. Alpha B-crystallin (CRYAB) has been identified as a downregulated gene in OA cartilage. However, the precise roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of CRYAB in OA progression have not been elucidated. In the present study, we found that the expression of CRYAB in cartilages from patients with OA was significantly lower than that in the cartilages from patients with no prior medical history of OA. We established mouse models with OA by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery and found that the expression of CRYAB in OA cartilage was lower than that in the normal cartilages, too. Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression of CRYAB was increased during chondrogenic differentiation and cartilage development. Functional assays revealed that overexpression of CRYAB promoted the proliferation of chondrocytes and inhibited apoptosis, while knockdown of CRYAB presented opposite results. In addition, overexpression of CRYAB upregulated the expression of anabolic markers, Col2a1 and ACAN, and reduced the expression of catabolic markers, MMP13 and ADAMTS5. Conversely, knockdown of CRYAB blocked the expression of the anabolic markers and increased the expression of catabolic markers. Collectively, the results suggest that CRYAB promoted the proliferation and extracellular matrix production of chondrocytes, and inhibited chondrocytes apoptosis and cartilage degradation simultaneously. Thus, CRYAB might be a potential therapeutic target for OA treatment.

Abstract: Summary
Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) contribute to drug resistance and tumor recurrence in cancers, thus experimental approaches to dissect the complexity of TICs are required to design successful TIC therapeutic strategies. Here, we show that miRNA-3′ UTR sensor vectors can be used as a pathway-based method to identify, enrich, and analyze TICs from primary solid tumor patient samples. We have found that an miR-181ahigh subpopulation of cells sorted from primary ovarian tumor cells exhibited TIC properties in vivo, were enriched in response to continuous cisplatin treatment, and showed activation of numerous major stem cell regulatory pathways. This miRNA-sensor-based platform enabled high-throughput drug screening leading to identification of BET inhibitors as transcriptional inhibitors of miR-181a. Taken together, we provide a valuable miRNA-sensor-based approach to broaden the understanding of complex TIC regulatory mechanisms in cancers and to identify miRNA-targeting drugs.

Abstract: Expansion of the mammary epithelial stem cell pool holds promise for consequent mammary gland development and production. Complementary analyses of bovine mammary implants maintained in de-epithelialized mouse mammary fat pad and endogenous mouse mammary gland were performed to elucidate the effect of calorie restriction (CR) on stem cell self-renewal. CR elevated propagation rate and non-adherent mammosphere generation in cultured bovine mammary cells. A corresponding decrease in progenitor-induced colony formation and differentiation marker expression was noted. In the mouse gland, CR enhanced the take rate of transplanted cells and outgrowths' fat pad occupancy. Downregulating mTOR activity by rapamycin administration reproduced CR's effects on stem cell self-renewal within a shorter period. Flow cytometry demonstrated a significant 1.5-fold increase in stem cell number and a corresponding decrease in luminal progenitor and differentiated cells. Consequent effects of rapamycin administration included enhanced ductlet generation in bovine implants and higher milk-protein gene expression in cultured mouse mammary cells. The stimulatory effect of CR on BST-1 expression in both bovine implants and mouse glands resembled that noted in the intestinal Paneth stem cell niche (Yilmaz et al., 2012). A putative niche may also exist in the mammary gland, conveying energy-status information to the insulated stem cells.

Abstract: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been a recalcitrant cancer without significant breakthroughs in clinical treatment during the past three decades. As there is a lack of effective protein inhibitor for SCLC targeted therapy, the discovery of new druggable SCLC biomarkers is a pressing work. Here we identified a new protein biomarker of SCLC, which is high density lipoprotein binding protein (HDLBP), through the aptamer generated by cell-SELEX against SCLC cells. Immunohistochemistry results showed an elevated HDLBP level in SCLC tissues from clinical samples. Attenuating HDLBP expression with siRNA inhibited proliferation and metastasis of SCLC cells in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Mechanism study revealed the new function of HDLBP in promoting G1/S cell cycle transition for tumor progression. While the inhibitor of HDLBP has been reported, our work suggested a promising potential of targeting HDLBP to improve the treatment of fatal SCLC and a powerful tool of using cell-SELEX in cancer medicine.

Abstract: pH has a great impact on the distribution, growth, behavior, and physiology in many aquatic animals. Here, we analyzed miRNA expression profiles of Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) from control pH (8.2) and low pH (6.5)-treated shrimp. Expression analysis identified 6 known miRNAs and 23 novel miRNAs with significantly different expression between control pH 8.2 and low pH 6.5; the predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were significantly enriched in organic acid metabolic process, oxidoreductase activity, coenzyme binding, cofactor binding, and collagen trimer. Moreover, target genes were significantly enriched in several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways including citrate cycle, pyruvate metabolism, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, tight junction, carbon metabolism, etc. Our survey expanded the number of known shrimp miRNAs and provided comprehensive information about miRNA response to low pH stress.

Abstract: The cellular stress response, which provides protection against proteotoxic stresses, is characterized by the activation of heat shock factor 1 and the formation of nuclear stress bodies (nSBs). In this study, we developed a computerized method to quantify the formation and size distribution of nSBs, as stress response induction is of interest in cancer research, neurodegenerative diseases, and in other pathophysiological processes. We employed an advanced bioimaging and analytics workflow to enable quantitative detailed subcellular analysis of cell populations even down to single-cell level. This type of detailed analysis requires automated single cell analysis to allow for detection of both size and distribution of nSBs. For specific induction of nSB we used mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) loaded with celastrol, a plant-derived triterpene with the ability to activate the stress response. To enable specific targeting, we employed folic acid functionalized nanoparticles, which yields targeting to folate receptor expressing cancer cells. In this way, we could assess the ability to quantitatively detect directed and spatio-temporal nSB induction using 2D and 3D confocal imaging. Our results demonstrate successful implementation of an imaging and analytics workflow based on a freely available, general-purpose software platform, BioImageXD, also compatible with other imaging modalities due to full 3D/4D and high-throughput batch processing support. The developed quantitative imaging analytics workflow opens possibilities for detailed stress response examination in cell populations, with significant potential in the analysis of targeted drug delivery systems related to cell stress and other cytoprotective cellular processes.

Abstract: Summary
Bacteriophages are the most abundant members of the microbiota and have the potential to shape gut bacterial communities. Changes to bacteriophage composition are associated with disease, but how phages impact mammalian health remains unclear. We noted an induction of host immunity when experimentally treating bacterially driven cancer, leading us to test whether bacteriophages alter immune responses. Treating germ-free mice with bacteriophages leads to immune cell expansion in the gut. Lactobacillus, Escherichia, and Bacteroides bacteriophages and phage DNA stimulated IFN-γ via the nucleotide-sensing receptor TLR9. The resultant immune responses were both phage and bacteria specific. Additionally, increasing bacteriophage levels exacerbated colitis via TLR9 and IFN-γ. Similarly, ulcerative colitis (UC) patients responsive to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have reduced phages compared to non-responders, and mucosal IFN-γ positively correlates with bacteriophage levels. Bacteriophages from active UC patients induced more IFN-γ compared to healthy individuals. Collectively, these results indicate that bacteriophages can alter mucosal immunity to impact mammalian health.

Abstract: Summary
Biopharmaceuticals have become increasingly attractive therapeutic agents and are often PEGylated to enhance their pharmacokinetics and reduce their immunogenicity. However, recent human clinical trials have demonstrated that administration of PEGylated compounds can evoke anti-PEG antibodies. Considering the ubiquity of PEG in commercial products and the presence of pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies in patients in large clinical trials evaluating a PEG-modified aptamer, we investigated how anti-PEG antibodies effect the therapeutic activities of PEGylated RNA aptamers. We demonstrate that anti-PEG antibodies can directly bind to and inhibit anticoagulant aptamer function in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in parallel studies we detected the presence of anti-PEG antibodies in nonhuman primates after a single administration of a PEGylated aptamer. Our results suggest that anti-PEG antibodies can limit the activity of PEGylated drugs and potentially compromise the activity of otherwise effective therapeutic agents.

Abstract: Increasing preclinical and clinical studies revealed that many tumor models had resistance to anti-VEGF-A and anti-VEGF-R2 therapies. Studies have shown that simultaneously blocked DLL4-Notch and VEGF signaling pathways can synergistically inhibit density and function of tumor blood vessels and reduce tumor growth rate. We successfully developed a bispecific monoclonal antibody (named HB-32) that targeting both human DLL4 and human VEGF. HB-32 showed high binding affinity to VEGF and DLL4. Furthermore, HB-32 inhibited proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVEC. Finally, in vivo xenograft studies demonstrated that HB-32 inhibited proliferation of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) and induced tumor cell apoptosis more efficiently than an anti-VEGF antibody or anti-DLL4 antibody alone. These findings indicate that our bispecific antibody provide a potential treatment for breast cancer.

Abstract: The K63-linked ubiquitination of RIP1 coordinates survival/death homeostasis by driving transcription of genes downstream of RelA. Previously, we demonstrated that EGF-dependent RelA transactivation overcomes hypoxia-initiated apoptosis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain mysterious. We report here that UBXN1 deficiency empowers apoptosis resistance against hypoxia through triggering IκBα degradation, for which K63-linked ubiquitination of RIP1 is required. MiR-124-3p is a bona fide inhibitor upstream of UBXN1, thereby antagonizing the hypoxia-initiated apoptosis. UBXN1 repression by miR-124-3p restores the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIP1, IKKβ phosphorylation, IκBα-RelA disassembly, RelA nuclear localization and transactivation of EGF gene as well as EGF secretion under hypoxia. Reconstitution of wild-type UBXN1, but not a truncated UBXN1ΔUBA mutant, or pharmacological inhibition of RelA transactivation in miR-124-3p-replete cells compromises the apoptosis-resistant phenotypes of miR-124-3p. Hypoxia transcriptionally downregulates miR-124-3p by disassociating RelA and RNAP II from its promoter. EGFR activation renders the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIP1 and hypoxic tolerance in conjunction with miR-124-3p. Our findings identify a pivotal role of miR-124-3p in ubiquitin conjugation of RIP1 against hypoxic damage and underscore that productive transcription of miR-124-3p by RelA and RNAP II might be a switching mechanism for this process.

Abstract: Summary
Commensal fungi of the mammalian skin, such as those of the genus Malassezia, are associated with atopic dermatitis and other common inflammatory skin disorders. Understanding of the causative relationship between fungal commensalism and disease manifestation remains incomplete. By developing a murine epicutaneous infection model, we found Malassezia spp. selectively induce IL-17 and related cytokines. This response is key in preventing fungal overgrowth on the skin, as disruption of the IL-23-IL-17 axis compromises Malassezia-specific cutaneous immunity. Under conditions of impaired skin integrity, mimicking a hallmark of atopic dermatitis, the presence of Malassezia dramatically aggravates cutaneous inflammation, which again was IL-23 and IL-17 dependent. Consistently, we found a CCR6+ Th17 subset of memory T cells to be Malassezia specific in both healthy individuals and atopic dermatitis patients, whereby the latter showed enhanced frequency of these cells. Thus, the Malassezia-induced type 17 response is pivotal in orchestrating antifungal immunity and in actively promoting skin inflammation.

Abstract: Summary
Despite being a frequent cause of severe diarrheal disease in infants and an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, Cryptosporidium research has lagged due to a lack of facile experimental methods. Here, we describe a platform for complete life cycle development and long-term growth of C. parvum in vitro using “air-liquid interface” (ALI) cultures derived from intestinal epithelial stem cells. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that differentiating epithelial cells grown under ALI conditions undergo profound changes in metabolism and development that enable completion of the parasite life cycle in vitro. ALI cultures support parasite expansion > 100-fold and generate viable oocysts that are transmissible in vitro and to mice, causing infection and animal death. Transgenic parasite lines created using CRISPR/Cas9 were used to complete a genetic cross in vitro, demonstrating Mendelian segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. ALI culture provides an accessible model that will enable innovative studies into Cryptosporidium biology and host interactions.

Abstract: Summary
Medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-like cells yielded from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hold great potentials for cell therapies of related neurological disorders. However, cues that orchestrate the maintenance versus differentiation of human MGE progenitors, and ways for large-scale expansion of these cells have not been investigated. Here, we report that WNT/CTNNB1 signaling plays an essential role in maintaining MGE-like cells derived from hPSCs. Ablation of CTNNB1 in MGE cells led to precocious cell-cycle exit and advanced neuronal differentiation. Activation of WNT signaling through genetic or chemical approach was sufficient to maintain MGE cells in an expandable manner with authentic neuronal differentiation potencies through activation of endogenous NOTCH signaling. Our findings reveal that WNT/NOTCH signaling cascade is a key player in governing the maintenance versus terminal differentiation of MGE progenitors in humans. Large-scale expansion of functional MGE progenitors for cell therapies can therefore be achieved by modifying WNT/NOTCH pathway.

Abstract: Summary
Nicotine, the main chemical constituent of tobacco, is highly detrimental to the developing fetus by increasing the risk of gestational complications and organ disorders. The effects of nicotine on human embryonic development and related mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived embryoid body (EB) in the presence or absence of nicotine. Nicotine-induced lineage-specific responses and dysregulated cell-to-cell communication in EBs, shedding light on the adverse effects of nicotine on human embryonic development. In addition, nicotine reduced cell viability, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and altered cell cycling in EBs. Abnormal Ca2+ signaling was found in muscle cells upon nicotine exposure, as verified in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes. Consequently, our scRNA-seq data suggest direct adverse effects of nicotine on hESC differentiation at the single-cell level and offer a new method for evaluating drug and environmental toxicity on human embryonic development in utero.

Abstract: Arterial medial calcification (AMC) is the deposition of calcium phosphate mineral, often as hydroxyapatite, in the medial layer of the arteries. AMC shares some similarities to skeletal mineralisation and has been associated with the transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) towards an osteoblast-like phenotype. This study used primary mouse VSMCs and calvarial osteoblasts to directly compare the established and widely used in vitro models of AMC and bone formation. Significant differences were identified between osteoblasts and calcifying VSMCs. First, osteoblasts formed large mineralised bone nodules that were associated with widespread deposition of an extracellular collagenous matrix. In contrast, VSMCs formed small discrete regions of calcification that were not associated with collagen deposition and did not resemble bone. Second, calcifying VSMCs displayed a progressive reduction in cell viability over time (≤7-fold), with a 50% increase in apoptosis, whereas osteoblast and control VSMCs viability remained unchanged. Third, osteoblasts expressed high levels of alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) activity and TNAP inhibition reduced bone formation by to 90%. TNAP activity in calcifying VSMCs was ∼100-fold lower than that of bone-forming osteoblasts and cultures treated with β-glycerophosphate, a TNAP substrate, did not calcify. Furthermore, TNAP inhibition had no effect on VSMC calcification. Although, VSMC calcification was associated with increased mRNA expression of osteoblast-related genes (e.g. Runx2, osterix, osteocalcin, osteopontin), the relative expression of these genes was up to 40-fold lower in calcifying VSMCs versus bone-forming osteoblasts. In summary, calcifying VSMCs in vitro display some limited osteoblast-like characteristics but also differ in several key respects: 1) their inability to form collagen-containing bone; 2) their lack of reliance on TNAP to promote mineral deposition; and, 3) the deleterious effect of calcification on their viability.

Abstract: GA binding protein (GABP) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that regulates the development of multiple cell types, including osteoblast, hematopoietic stem cells, B cells and T cells. However, so little is known about its biological function in the development of central nervous system. In this report, we show that GABP is highly expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) and down-regulated in neurons, and that GABPβ1 is required for the proper proliferation of NSPCs. Knockdown of GABPα resulted in an elevated expression level of GABPβ1, and GABPβ1 down-regulation significantly decreased the proliferation of NSPCs, whereas GABPβ2 knockdown did not result in any changes in the proliferation of NSPCs. We observed that there was nearly a 21-fold increase of the GABPβ1S mRNA level in GABPβ1L KO NSPCs compared to WT cells, and knocking down of GABPβ1S in GABPβ1L KO NSPCs could further reduce their proliferation potential. We also found that knockdown of GABPβ1 promoted neuronal and astrocytic differentiation of NSPCs. Finally, we identified dozens of downstream target genes of GABPβ1, which are closely associated with the cell proliferation and differentiation. Collectively, our results suggest that both GABPβ1L and GABPβ1S play an essential role in regulating the proper proliferation and differentiation of NSPCs.

Abstract: Summary
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) represent a powerful system to study human development and are promising candidates for clinical translation as drug-screening tools or engineered tissue. Experimental control and clinical use of HIOs is limited by growth in expensive and poorly defined tumor-cell-derived extracellular matrices, prompting investigation of synthetic ECM-mimetics for HIO culture. Since HIOs possess an inner epithelium and outer mesenchyme, we hypothesized that adhesive cues provided by the matrix may be dispensable for HIO culture. Here, we demonstrate that alginate, a minimally supportive hydrogel with no inherent cell instructive properties, supports HIO growth in vitro and leads to HIO epithelial differentiation that is virtually indistinguishable from Matrigel-grown HIOs. In addition, alginate-grown HIOs mature to a similar degree as Matrigel-grown HIOs when transplanted in vivo, both resembling human fetal intestine. This work demonstrates that purely mechanical support from a simple-to-use and inexpensive hydrogel is sufficient to promote HIO survival and development.

Abstract: Classically activated macrophages (CAMs) play a crucial protective role in the host by killing the invading pathogens. However, excessive activation of CAMs causes chronic inflammation leading to host tissue damage. Thus, control of macrophage activity is necessary to prevent chronic inflammation. To date, regulation of CAMs in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases has not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of a pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, in cell death in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages, CAMs. Necrostatin-1, an inhibitor of necroptosis, inhibited zVAD-fmk-induced cell death in CAMs. The expression of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) involved in the necroptosis pathway was up-regulated by LPS in CAMs. zVAD-fmk enhanced the phosphorylation of MLKL in CAMs. Moreover, inhibition of activation of mitogen activated protein kinase p38 and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduced zVAD-fmk-induced cell death in CAMs. Inhibition of ROS generation decreased the activation of MLKL and p38 in zVAD-fmk-treated CAMs. These results, taken together, indicate that zVAD-fmk-induced cell death occurred by necroptosis through ROS-mediated activation of MLKL and p38 in CAMs. Elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying zVAD-fmk-induced necroptosis in CAMs might help in better understanding its significance in chronic inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Transmembrane protein 18 (Tmem18) is an obesity-associated gene essential for adipogenesis; however, its function in the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) is still unclear. In this study, we found that Tmem18 was significantly downregulated in rat BMSCs after osteogenic induction. TMEM18 overexpression remarkably downregulated osteo-specific genes including alkaline phosphatase (Alp), Runt˗related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osteocalcin (Ocn), and osteopontin (Opn), and reduced the number of mineral deposits and ALP activity in vitro, whereas knockdown of Tmem18 yielded the opposite results. In vivo assays also indicated that TMEM18 knockdown BMSCs have an increased bone formation potential in a rat model of calvarial defects. Analyses of the mechanism suggested that TMEM18 overexpression decreased β-catenin expression, whereas the TMEM18 knockdown enhanced β-catenin expression and promoted its nuclear translocation. The positive effects on osteogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs owing to the TMEM18 knockdown were attenuated by β-catenin downregulation. Taken together, these results indicate that TMEM18 plays an inhibitory role in osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs via inactivation of β-catenin.

Abstract: Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II) is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD), caused by iduronate 2-sulphatase (IDS) enzyme dysfunction. The neuropathology of the disease is not well understood, although the neural symptoms are currently incurable. MPS II-patient derived iPSC lines were established and differentiated to neuronal lineage. The disease phenotype was confirmed by IDS enzyme and glycosaminoglycan assay. MPS II neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) showed significantly decreased self-renewal capacity, while their cortical neuronal differentiation potential was not affected. Major structural alterations in the ER and Golgi complex, accumulation of storage vacuoles, and increased apoptosis were observed both at protein expression and ultrastructural level in the MPS II neuronal cells, which was more pronounced in GFAP + astrocytes, with increased LAMP2 expression but unchanged in their RAB7 compartment. Based on these finding we hypothesize that lysosomal membrane protein (LMP) carrier vesicles have an initiating role in the formation of storage vacuoles leading to impaired lysosomal function. In conclusion, a novel human MPS II disease model was established for the first time which recapitulates the in vitro neuropathology of the disorder, providing novel information on the disease mechanism which allows better understanding of further lysosomal storage disorders and facilitates drug testing and gene therapy approaches.

Abstract: Summary
Nerve growth factor elicits signaling outcomes by interacting with both its high-affinity receptor, TrkA, and its low-affinity receptor, p75NTR. Although these two receptors can regulate distinct cellular outcomes, they both activate the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathway upon nerve growth factor stimulation. To delineate TrkA subcircuits in PC12 cell differentiation, we developed an optogenetic system whereby light was used to specifically activate TrkA signaling in the absence of nerve growth factor. By using tyrosine mutants of the optogenetic TrkA in combination with pathway-specific pharmacological inhibition, we find that Y490 and Y785 each contributes to PC12 cell differentiation through the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathway in an additive manner. Optogenetic activation of TrkA eliminates the confounding effect of p75NTR and other potential off-target effects of the ligand. This approach can be generalized for the mechanistic study of other receptor-mediated signaling pathways.

Abstract: Summary
Evaluation of HIV cure strategies is complicated by defective proviruses that persist in ART-treated patients but are irrelevant to cure. Non-human primates (NHP) are essential for testing cure strategies. However, the persisting proviral landscape in ART-treated NHPs is uncharacterized. Here, we describe viral genomes persisting in ART-treated, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected NHPs, simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected NHPs, and humans infected with HIV-2, an SIV-related virus. The landscapes of persisting SIV, SHIV, and HIV-2 genomes are also dominated by defective sequences. However, there was a significantly higher fraction of intact SIV proviral genomes compared to ART-treated HIV-1 or HIV-2 infected humans. Compared to humans with HIV-1, SIV-infected NHPs had more hypermutated genomes, a relative paucity of clonal SIV sequences, and a lower frequency of deleted genomes. Finally, we report an assay for measuring intact SIV genomes which may have value in cure research.

Abstract: Summary
Plasmodium sporozoites inoculated by mosquitoes migrate to the liver and infect hepatocytes prior to release of merozoites that initiate symptomatic blood-stage malaria. Plasmodium parasites are thought to be restricted to hepatocytes throughout this obligate liver stage of development, and how liver-stage-expressed antigens prime productive CD8 T cell responses remains unknown. We found that a subset of liver-infiltrating monocyte-derived CD11c+ cells co-expressing F4/80, CD103, CD207, and CSF1R acquired parasites during the liver stage of malaria, but only after initial hepatocyte infection. These CD11c+ cells found in the infected liver and liver-draining lymph nodes exhibited transcriptionally and phenotypically enhanced antigen-presentation functions and primed protective CD8 T cell responses against Plasmodium liver-stage-restricted antigens. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized aspect of Plasmodium biology and uncover the fundamental mechanism by which CD8 T cell responses are primed against liver-stage malaria antigens.

Abstract: The sperm-associated antigen 5 (SPAG5) plays a key role in controlling cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and proliferation. However, the role of SPAG5 in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. Herein, our study showed that upregulation of SPAG5 was detected frequently in GC tissues, and was associated with significantly worse survival in patients with GC. Multivariate analyses revealed that high SPAG5 expression was an independent predictive marker for the poor prognosis of GC patients. Further, SPAG5 knockdown notably inhibited the proliferation abilities of GC in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, our results indicate that SPAG5 promotes cell progression by increasing Survivin expression, which has been reported to control the progression of GC. Moreover, our data demonstrate that Survivin is crucial for SPAG5-mediated GC cell progression in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that SPAG5 promotes the progression of GC via enhancing the Wnt/β-catenin/Survivin axis. Collectively, our data suggest that SPAG5 plays a crucial oncogenic role in GC tumorigenesis, and we provide a novel evidence that SPAG5 may be serve as a prognostic and therapeutic target for GC patients.

Abstract: Summary
We evaluate whether human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium (iPSC-RPE) cells can be used to prioritize and functionally characterize causal variants at age-related macular degeneration (AMD) risk loci. We generated iPSC-RPE from six subjects and show that they have morphological and molecular characteristics similar to those of native RPE. We generated RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and H3K27ac ChIP-seq data and observed high similarity in gene expression and enriched transcription factor motif profiles between iPSC-RPE and human fetal RPE. We performed fine mapping of AMD risk loci by integrating molecular data from the iPSC-RPE, adult retina, and adult RPE, which identified rs943080 as the probable causal variant at VEGFA. We show that rs943080 is associated with altered chromatin accessibility of a distal ATAC-seq peak, decreased overall gene expression of VEGFA, and allele-specific expression of a non-coding transcript. Our study thus provides a potential mechanism underlying the association of the VEGFA locus with AMD.

Abstract: Biotin is an indispensable adipogenic agent, and its ability to coordinate carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism sensitizes insulin signaling in adipocytes. This enables the organism to adapt and survive under nutrient stress by synthesis and storage of lipids. Biotin deficiency mimics insulin resistance with alterations in cellular intermediary metabolism. Though the mechanism of lipogenesis is well established across cell types, considering its predisposition to accumulate only lipids, it is necessary to elucidate the mechanism that minimizes the effects of biotin on adipocyte protein synthesis. In order to determine the differential metabolic phenotype by biotin, the primary cultures of adipocytes were induced to differentiate in the presence and absence of excess biotin. Serum pre-incubated with avidin was used to limit biotin availability in cultured cells. Biotin restricts cellular signaling associated with protein synthesis without altering total protein content. The decline in autophagy elicits endoplasmic reticulum stress to inhibit protein synthesis by eIF2α phosphorylation possibly via accumulation of misfolded/long-lived proteins. Furthermore, the compensatory increase in Unc51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 possibly competes with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 and ribosomal p70 S6kinase phosphorylation by mechanistic targets of rapamycin complex 1 to uncouple its effect on protein synthesis. In conclusion, autophagy inhibition by biotin uncouples protein synthesis to promote lipogenesis by eliciting endoplasmic reticulum stress and differential phosphorylation of mechanistic targets of rapamycin complex 1 substrates.

Abstract: Despite having favorable prognosis, patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) still suffer from reduced lifespan due to recurrences, metastasis, and dedifferentiation. Regulatory B (Breg) cells are essential to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance, but upregulated Breg response may impede the clearance of pathogens and tumor cells. Here, we found that in PBMCs, the frequency of IL-10+ circulating B cells ex vivo and following stimulation was similar between DTC patients and healthy controls. However, in resected tumor, the frequency of IL-10+ B cells was significantly elevated and was positively correlated with the frequency of tumor-infiltrating CD4+Foxp3+ T cells. The quantity of IL-10 produced by B cells was significantly higher in DTC patients than in controls. Moreover, each IL-10-producing B cell in DTC patients produced more IL-10 than the counterparts in healthy controls. This IL-10+ subset was enriched in the CD27+ fraction. Under an in vitro setting, CD27+ B cells inhibited IFN-γ expression from CD4+ T cells and IFN-γ, perforin, and granzyme B expression from CD8+ T cells. Suppression of IL-10 could rescue IFN-γ production but was unable to completely rescue perforin and granzyme B expression. The proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, on the other hand, was not affected by CD27+ B cells. Interestingly, CD27+ B cells improved the survival of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in an IL-10-dependent manner. In addition, the phosphorylation level of STAT3 and Erk was examined in CD27+ B cells. Unstimulated CD27+ B cells presented low STAT3 and Erk phosphorylation in both healthy controls and DTC patients, with no significant difference between the two groups. Overall, this study suggests that B cell-mediated IL-10 production can exert complex effects toward autologous T cells.

Abstract: Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy marked by the accumulation of large numbers of immature myeloblasts in bone marrow. The overall prognosis in AML is poor; hence, there is a pressing need to improve treatment. Although the sphingolipid (SL) ceramide demonstrates known cancer suppressor properties, it’s mechanism of action is multifaceted. Our studies in leukemia and other cancers have demonstrated that when combined with the antiestrogen, tamoxifen, the apoptosis-inducting effect of ceramide is greatly enhanced. The goal of the present study was to establish whether a ceramide-tamoxifen regimen also affects autophagic-driven cellular responses in leukemia. Using the human AML cell line KG-1, we demonstrate that, unlike exposure to the single agents, combination C6-ceramide-tamoxifen upregulated LC3-II expression, inhibited the mTOR signaling pathway, and synergistically induced KG-1 cell death in an Atg5-dependent manner. In addition, colocalization of autophagosome and mitochondria, indicative of mitophagosome formation and mitophagy, was observed. Versatility of the drug regimen was confirmed by experiments in MV4-11 cells, a FLT3-ITD AML mutant. These results indicate that the C6-ceramide-tamoxifen regimen plays a pivotal role inducing autophagy in AML, and thus constitutes a novel therapeutic design.

Abstract: Summary
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are used in many clinical applications. However, ex vivo expansion is required to reach clinically relevant cell numbers, which might lead to selection of clones with different characteristics. To follow clonal selection, we transduced MSC progenitors in umbilical cord pieces (UCPs) with vectors encoding fluorescent proteins and genetic barcodes. After marked MSC cultures grew out from UCPs, we investigated the influence of cytokines on MSC functionality. Specific cytokine conditions selected for clones from common progenitors. MSC secretome analyses revealed differences dependent on the culture conditions used. Clones expanded in human serum containing culture medium secreted a plethora of growth factors. When expanded in the same medium containing TGF-β, MSCs secreted negligible amounts of cytokines but at the same time led to an increased human chimerism after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation into immunodeficient mice. Our results suggest a major influence of cytokine additives on MSC functionality.

Abstract: Summary
Glycolysis and hypoxia are key regulators of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) self-renewal, but how changes in metabolism affect gene expression is poorly understood. C-terminal binding proteins (CTBPs) are glycolytic sensors that through NADH binding link the metabolic state of the cell to its gene expression, by acting as transcriptional corepressors, or coactivators. However, the role of CTBPs in hESCs has not previously been investigated. A direct interaction between hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) and the CTBP proximal promoters in hESCs cultured only under hypoxia was demonstrated. Decreasing the rate of flux through glycolysis in hESCs maintained under hypoxia resulted in a reduction of CTBPs, OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, but also in the expression of HIF-2α. Silencing CTBP expression resulted in the loss of pluripotency marker expression demonstrating that CTBPs are involved in hESC maintenance. These data suggest that under hypoxia, glycolysis regulates self-renewal through HIF-2α and the induction of the metabolic sensors CTBPs.

Abstract: Cells express multiple biophysical cues during migration, differentiation, and transformation. Probing and quantifying these biophysical cues could serve as a diagnostic tool for differentiating healthy with neoplastic cells. These biophysical cues may be utilized for diagnostic screening in cancer, as the tumor cells interact with the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Stress and strain induced by the cancer cells and applied to the cancer cells have effects in cancer progression due to its influence in cell migration. It was reported that the introduction of compressive forces on cancerous cells triggers them to undergo apoptosis. In this report, we evaluated the effects of stretching forces on cancer cells by morphological analyses. We observed that cancer cells decrease their roundness (as determined by perimeter: area); increase their length and form filopodia in the initial stretching cycle. However, due to the increasing rigidity of the cells, they undergo apoptosis in later stretching cycles. These morphological changes were unique to breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells compared to the non-cancerous control. Elucidating and quantifying these morphological changes is potentially an early cancer diagnostic tool that may predict the propensity of the cancerous cells undergoing a metastatic transformation.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading cancers in the world in incidence and mortality. Current pharmacotherapy of HCC is limited in the number and efficacy of anticancer agents. Metabolic reprogramming is a prominent feature of many cancers and has rekindled interest in targeting metabolic proteins for cancer therapy. Glycogen is a storage form of glucose, and the levels of glycogen have been found to correlate with biological processes in reprogrammed cancer cells. However, the contribution of glycogen metabolism to carcinogenesis, cancer cell growth, metastasis, and chemoresistance is poorly understood. Thus, we studied the processes involved in the inhibition of glycogen metabolism in HCC cells. Pharmacological inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase (GP), a rate-limiting enzyme in glycogen catabolism, by CP-91149 led to a decrease in HCC cell viability. GP inhibition induced cancer cell death through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Mitochondrial dysfunction and autophagic adaptations accompanied this apoptosis process whereas endoplasmic reticulum stress, necrosis, and necroptosis were not major components of the cell death. In addition, GP inhibition potentiated the effects of multikinase inhibitors sorafenib and regorafenib, which are key drugs in advanced-stage HCC therapy. Our study provides mechanistic insights into cell death by perturbation of glycogen metabolism and identifies GP inhibition as a potential HCC pharmacotherapy target.

Abstract: Abnormal signaling transduction in salivary gland cells is associated with the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Previously, we identified aberrant expression of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in gland cells of SS patients and mouse models. In this study, we investigated the role of TLR9 and its downstream p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) signaling in mediating apoptosis and autophagy in human salivary gland (HSG) cells. We selected either CpG-Odn, a classical TLR9 activator, or lentivirus-packaged TLR9 full-length cDNA to activate TLR9 signaling transduction. Activation of TLR9 signaling induced phosphorylation of its downstream protein kinases, p38/MAPK and JNK, in a time-dependent manner, and decreased HSG cell viability. Western blotting of LC3B-II and p62 in both normal and autophagic flux-administered conditions revealed elevated autophagy upon TLR9 activation. Observing the cell cytoplasm through transmission electron microscopy and mRFP-GFP-LC3B-tagged fluorescence confirmed an increased number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in TLR9-activated cells. Bax/Bcl-2 ratio calculations, caspase-3 activity assays and Hoechst nuclear staining were utilized to confirm the involvement of apoptosis in TLR9 signaling activation. Furthermore, we selected SB239063, a p38/MAPK signaling inhibitor, and SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, to identify the functions of p38/MAPK and JNK in TLR9-mediated signaling transduction. Multiple approaches, including Western blotting assays, fluorescence assessments and caspase-3 activity measurements, confirmed that inhibition of p38/MAPK signaling ameliorated both autophagy and apoptosis in TLR9-activated HSG cells, whereas inhibition of JNK signaling attenuated apoptosis but failed to modulate autophagy in the models mentioned above. Our results indicate a divergent function of p38/MAPK and JNK in TLR9-mediated autophagy and apoptosis in salivary gland cells.

Abstract: IL10 is generally regarded as a broad-spectrum regulatory cytokine. However, the role of IL10 in CD8 T cells remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of endogenous IL10 by CD8 T cells in gastric cancer (GC) patients. Using intracellular staining, we found that in both GC patients and healthy controls, the majority of IL10-expressing CD8 T cells also presented concurrent IFNg expression. Interestingly, the frequency of IFNg+IL10+ CD8 T cells was significantly higher in GC patients than in healthy controls, while the frequency of IFNg+IL10- CD8 T cells was significantly lower in GC patients than in healthy controls. Compared to the IFNg-IL10- CD8 T cells, both IFNg+IL10- and IFNg+IL10+ CD8 T cells presented significantly higher expression of activation/inhibitory markers. Interestingly, the IFNg+IL10+ cells presented lower PD1 and TIM3 and higher KLRG1 than the IFNg+IL10- CD8 T cells. Remarkably, the IFNg+IL10+ CD8 T cells, but not the IFNg+IL10- CD8 T cells, were highly enriched in the CD45RO+CXCR5+ subset. Prolonged activation resulted in significant enrichment of IFNg+IL10+ CD8 T cells over time. Interestingly, compared to the CD45RO+CXCR5- CD8 T cells, the CD45RO+CXCR5+ CD8 T cells presented stronger proliferation capacity at later stages of stimulation, and higher viability throughout the stimulation process. Overall, our investigation demonstrated that GC patients were enriched with a distinctive population of IFNg+IL10+ double positive CD8 T cells, which resembled T follicular cytotoxic cells and could persist longer during prolonged activation.

Abstract: Summary
Humans are repeatedly exposed to influenza virus via infections and vaccinations. Understanding how multiple exposures and pre-existing immunity impact antibody responses is essential for vaccine development. Given the recent prevalence of influenza H1N1 A/California/7/2009 (CA09), we examined the clonal composition and dynamics of CA09 hemagglutinin (HA)-reactive IgG repertoire over 5 years in a donor with multiple influenza exposures. The anti-CA09 HA polyclonal response in this donor comprised 24 persistent antibody clonotypes, accounting for 72.6% ± 10.0% of the anti-CA09 HA repertoire over 5 years. These persistent antibodies displayed higher somatic hypermutation relative to transient serum antibodies detected at one time point. Additionally, persistent antibodies predominantly demonstrated cross-reactivity and potent neutralization toward a phylogenetically distant H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VT04) strain, a feature correlated with HA stem recognition. This analysis reveals how “serological imprinting” impacts responses to influenza and suggests that once elicited, cross-reactive antibodies targeting the HA stem can persist for years.

Abstract: Chemoresistance is the leading cause of breast cancer therapy failure, and studies of the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance and the treatment of drug-resistant tumors remain challenging. In the present study, we discovered a novel microRNA, miR3609, that influences the malignancy of breast cancer. Our results showed miR-3609 expression was lower in resistant breast cancer cells than in sensitive breast cancer cells (MCF-7), while PD-L1 expression was higher in resistant breast cancer cells than in sensitive breast cancer cells. Co-transfection of a miR-3609 plasmid with a luciferase construct containing the PD-L1 3′-untranslated region suppressed luciferase activity. Transfection of a miR-3609 mimic markedly suppressed PD-L1 protein expression in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in a dose-dependent manner and increased the sensitivity of MCF7/ADR cells to adriamycin, whereas transfection of a miR-3609 inhibitor enhanced PD-L1 protein expression in HBL-100 and MCF-7 cells. In addition, knockdown of PD-L1 by siRNA restored the sensitivity of MCF7/ADR cells to adriamycin. Mice injected with breast cancer cells stably overexpressing miR3609 survived markedly longer and had fewer tumors than mice injected with control miRNA (miR-sc)-transfected cells. Treatment with a CD8+ blocking antibody (anti-CD8) eliminated these effects, suggesting that CD8+ T cells are required for the efficacy of miR3609 in breast cancer. Further, low miR-3609 expression and high PD-L1 expression were correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Therefore, restoration of miR-3609 expression may sensitize breast cancer to adriamycin by blocking PD-L1 expression.

Abstract: Summary
Widespread antibiotic resistance has led to the reappraisal of abandoned antibiotics including chloramphenicol. However, enzyme(s) underlying one form of chloramphenicol resistance, nitroreduction, have eluded identification. Here we demonstrate that expression of the Haemophilus influenzae nitroreductase gene nfsB confers chloramphenicol resistance in Escherichia coli. We characterized the enzymatic product of H. influenzae NfsB acting on chloramphenicol and found it to be amino-chloramphenicol. Kinetic analysis revealed reduction of diverse substrates including the incomplete reduction of 5-nitro antibiotics metronidazole and nitrofurantoin, likely resulting in activation of these antibiotic pro-drugs to their cytotoxic forms. We observed that expression of the H. influenzae nfsB gene in E. coli results in significantly increased susceptibility to metronidazole. Finally, we found that in this strain metronidazole attenuates chloramphenicol resistance synergistically, and in vitro metronidazole weakly inhibits chloramphenicol reduction by NfsB. Our findings reveal the underpinnings of a chloramphenicol resistance mechanism nearly 70 years after its description.

Abstract: Summary
Deep learning is a significant step forward for developing autonomous tasks. One of its branches, computer vision, allows image recognition with high accuracy thanks to the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our goal was to train a CNN with transmitted light microscopy images to distinguish pluripotent stem cells from early differentiating cells. We induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells to epiblast-like cells and took images at several time points from the initial stimulus. We found that the networks can be trained to recognize undifferentiated cells from differentiating cells with an accuracy higher than 99%. Successful prediction started just 20 min after the onset of differentiation. Furthermore, CNNs displayed great performance in several similar pluripotent stem cell (PSC) settings, including mesoderm differentiation in human induced PSCs. Accurate cellular morphology recognition in a simple microscopic set up may have a significant impact on how cell assays are performed in the near future.

Abstract: Wound closure, as a result of collective cell growth, is an essential biological response to injury. In the field of vascular biology, the response of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) to injury and substrate surface is important in therapeutic clinical treatment interventions such as angioplasty and atherectomy. Specifically, the mechanism by which cells close wounds (i.e. proliferation versus migration) in response to injury stimuli is of interest to better modulate recurrent vascular stenosis, prevent thrombus formation, occlusion, and life-threatening cardiovascular events. Here, we examine growth extent and temporal sequence of events following wound or gap introduction to a confluent monolayer of vascular SMCs or ECs. Significant differences in the preferred mechanisms of these cells to close wounds or gaps were observed; after 48 h, 73% of SMC wound closure was observed to be due to proliferation, while 75% of EC wound closure resulted from migration. These mechanisms were further modulated via addition or removal of extracellular matrix substrate and injury, with ECs more responsive to substrate composition and less to injury, in comparison to SMCs. Our results indicate that ECs and SMCs heal wounds differently, and that the time and mode of injury and associated substrate surface all impact this response.

Abstract: Summary
Cancer cells sustain growth by altering their metabolism to accelerated aerobic glycolysis accompanied by increased glucose demand and employ glutamine as additional nutrient source. This metabolic adaptation induces upregulation of glucose transporters GLUT-1 and -3, and simultaneous targeting of both transporters and of glutamine metabolism may offer a promising approach to inhibit cancer cell growth. We describe the discovery of the very potent glucose uptake inhibitor Glutor, which targets glucose transporters GLUT-1, -2, and -3, attenuates glycolytic flux and potently and selectively suppresses growth of a variety of cancer cell lines. Co-treatment of colon cancer cells with Glutor and glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 very potently and synergistically inhibits cancer cell growth. Such a dual inhibition promises to be particularly effective because it targets the metabolic plasticity as well as metabolic rescue mechanisms in cancer cells.

Abstract: Studies on TCP1-1 ring complex (TRiC) chaperonin have shown its indispensable role in folding cytosolic proteins in eukaryotes. In a psychrophilic organism, extreme cold temperature creates a low-energy environment that potentially causes protein denaturation with loss of activity. We hypothesized that TRiC may undergo evolution in terms of its structural molecular adaptation in order to facilitate protein folding in low-energy environment. To test this hypothesis, we isolated G. antarctica TRiC (GaTRiC) and found that the expression of GaTRiC mRNA in G. antarctica was consistently expressed at all temperatures indicating their importance in cell regulation. Moreover, we showed GaTRiC has the ability of a chaperonin whereby denatured luciferase can be folded to the functional stage in its presence. Structurally, three categories of residue substitutions were found in α, β, and δ subunits: (i) bulky/polar side chains to alanine or valine, (ii) charged residues to alanine, and (iii) isoleucine to valine that would be expected to increase intramolecular flexibility within the GaTRiC. The residue substitutions observed in the built structures possibly affect the hydrophobic, hydrogen bonds, and ionic and aromatic interactions which lead to an increase in structural flexibility. Our structural and functional analysis explains some possible structural features which may contribute to cold adaptation of the psychrophilic TRiC folding chamber.

Abstract: Summary
The transcription factor Max is a basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHLZ) protein that forms homodimers or interacts with other bHLHLZ proteins, including Myc and Mxd proteins. Among this dynamic network of interactions, the Myc/Max heterodimer has crucial roles in regulating normal cellular processes, but its transcriptional activity is deregulated in a majority of human cancers. Despite this significance, the arsenal of high-quality chemical probes to interrogate these proteins remains limited. We used small molecule microarrays to identify compounds that bind Max in a mechanistically unbiased manner. We discovered the asymmetric polycyclic lactam, KI-MS2-008, which stabilizes the Max homodimer while reducing Myc protein and Myc-regulated transcript levels. KI-MS2-008 also decreases viable cancer cell growth in a Myc-dependent manner and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of modulating Max with small molecules and supports altering Max dimerization as an alternative approach to targeting Myc.

Here, we identify the prototypical pyranonaphthoquinone natural product frenolicin B (FB) as a selective inhibitor of Prx1 and Grx3 through covalent modification of active-site cysteines. FB-targeted inhibition of Prx1 and Grx3 results in a decrease in cellular glutathione levels, an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and concomitant inhibition of cancer cell growth, largely by activating the peroxisome-bound tuberous sclerosis complex to inhibit mTORC1/4E-BP1 signaling axis. FB structure-activity relationship studies reveal a positive correlation between inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, ROS-mediated cancer cell cytotoxicity, and suppression of tumor growth in vivo. These findings establish FB as the most potent Prx1/Grx3 inhibitor reported to date and also notably highlight 4E-BP1 phosphorylation status as a potential predictive marker in response to ROS-based therapies in cancer.

Abstract: CRYAB is a small heat shock protein (sHSP) that has previously been shown to protect the heart against various cellular stresses; however, its precise function in myocardial cell injury caused by heat stress remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism by which CRYAB protects cardiomyocytes against heat stress. We constructed two H9C2 cell lines that stably express CRYAB protein to differing degrees: CRYAB-5 and CRYAB-7. Both CRYAB-5 and CRYAB-7 showed significantly reduced granular degeneration and vacuolar degeneration following heat stress compared to control cells. In addition, CRYAB overexpression in H9C2 cells relieved cell cycle proportion at the G0/G1 phase following heat stress compared to control cells. These protective effects were associated with the level of CRYAB protein expression. Our immunofluorescence analysis showed CRYAB could translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus under heat stress conditions, but that CRYAB co-localized with F-actin (which accumulates under stress conditions). Indeed, overexpression of CRYAB significantly reduced the aggregation of F-actin in H9C2 cells caused by heat stress. Furthermore, overexpressing CRYAB protein significantly reduced the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes induced by heat stress, likely by reducing the expression of cleaved-caspase 3. Collectively, our results show overexpression of CRYAB significantly increases the heat resistance of H9C2 cardiomyocytes, likely by reducing F-actin aggregation (thus stabilizing the cytoskeleton), regulating the cell cycle, and preventing caspase-mediated apoptosis.

Abstract: Summary
Mucosal barriers are densely colonized by pathobiont microbes such as Candida albicans, capable of invasive disseminated infection. However, systemic infections occur infrequently in healthy individuals, suggesting that pathobiont commensalism may elicit host benefits. We show that intestinal colonization with C. albicans drives systemic expansion of fungal-specific Th17 CD4+ T cells and IL-17 responsiveness by circulating neutrophils, which synergistically protect against C. albicans invasive infection. Protection conferred by commensal C. albicans requires persistent fungal colonization and extends to other extracellular invasive pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. However, commensal C. albicans does not protect against intracellular influenza virus infection and exacerbates allergic airway inflammation susceptibility, indicating that positively calibrating systemic Th17 responses is not uniformly beneficial. Thus, systemic Th17 inflammation driven by CD4+ T cells responsive to tonic stimulation by commensal C. albicans improves host defense against extracellular pathogens, but with potentially harmful immunological consequences.

Abstract: Summary
Virulence induction in the Staphylococcus aureus is under the control of a quorum sensing (QS) circuit encoded by the accessory gene regulator (agr) locus. Allelic variation within agr produces four QS specificity groups, each producing a unique secreted autoinducer peptide (AIP) and receptor histidine kinase (RHK), AgrC. Cognate AIP-AgrC interactions activate virulence through a two-component signaling cascade, whereas non-cognate pairs are generally inhibitory. Here we pinpoint a key hydrogen-bonding interaction within AgrC that acts as a switch to convert helical motions propagating from the receptor sensor domain into changes in inter-domain association within the kinase module. AgrC mutants lacking this interaction are constitutively active in vitro and in vivo, the latter leading to a pronounced attenuation of S. aureus biofilm formation. Thus, our work sheds light on the regulation of this biomedically important RHK.

Abstract: Tendinopathy is a common and disabling condition that is difficult to treat. The pathomolecular events behind tendinopathy remain uncertain. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and may play a role in tendinopathy development. Tenocytes were obtained from human patellar tendons in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Micro-RNA mimics and antagomirs for miR-30d, 26a, and 29a were separately transfected into tenocyte culture. Gene expression for scleraxis, collagen 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1), collagen 3 alpha 1 (COL3A1), interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2), bone morphogenic protein 12 (BMP12), and osteocalcin was determined for each miRNA mimic and antagomir transfection using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The results showed that exogenous miR-29a downregulated BMP2 and BMP12, while miR-26a and miR-30d did not have a significant effect on tenocyte gene expression. These findings suggest miR-29a contributes to tendon homeostasis and can serve as a potential therapeutic target in treating tendinopathy.

Abstract: Summary
The olfactory epithelium (OE) regenerates after injury via two types of tissue stem cells: active globose cells (GBCs) and dormant horizontal basal cells (HBCs). HBCs are roused to activated status by OE injury when P63 levels fall. However, an in-depth understanding of activation requires a system for culturing them that maintains both their self-renewal and multipotency while preventing spontaneous differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that mouse, rat, and human HBCs can be cultured and passaged as P63+ multipotent cells. HBCs in vitro closely resemble HBCs in vivo based on immunocytochemical and transcriptomic comparisons. Genetic lineage analysis demonstrates that HBCs in culture arise from both tissue-derived HBCs and multipotent GBCs. Treatment with retinoic acid induces neuronal and non-neuronal differentiation and primes cultured HBCs for transplantation into the lesioned OE. Engrafted HBCs generate all OE cell types, including olfactory sensory neurons, confirming that HBC multipotency and neurocompetency are maintained in culture.

Abstract: Summary
Eeyarestatin 1 (ES1) inhibits p97-dependent protein degradation, Sec61-dependent protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and vesicular transport within the endomembrane system. Here, we show that ES1 impairs Ca2+ homeostasis by enhancing the Ca2+ leakage from mammalian ER. A comparison of various ES1 analogs suggested that the 5-nitrofuran (5-NF) ring of ES1 is crucial for this effect. Accordingly, the analog ES24, which conserves the 5-NF domain of ES1, selectively inhibited protein translocation into the ER, displayed the highest potency on ER Ca2+ leakage of ES1 analogs studied and induced Ca2+-dependent cell death. Using small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Sec61α, we identified Sec61 complexes as the targets that mediate the gain of Ca2+ leakage induced by ES1 and ES24. By interacting with the lateral gate of Sec61α, ES1 and ES24 likely capture Sec61 complexes in a Ca2+-permeable, open state, in which Sec61 complexes allow Ca2+ leakage but are translocation incompetent.

Abstract: Currently, HGF/C-Met signaling inhibitors are being investigated to determine if they are useful for enhancing progenitor cell differentiation into osteoblasts, and one of them, BMS-777607, has been utilized to treat osteoporosis and bone loss in several types of diseases. However, whether BMS-777607 could be a potential treatment during fracture healing remains elusive. Here, we examined the therapeutic effects of BMS-777607 on bone fracture healing in a mouse model. In vivo radiological analysis showed that fractures treated with BMS-777607 exhibited accelerated osteotylus formation during the early stage of bone healing. Thereafter, the Safranin O staining evaluation indicated that the structure of the external callus in the Treatment group was larger than that in the Vehicle group at week 2. Furthermore, cellular proliferation of MC3T3-E1 was not significantly affected by low concentrations of BMS-777607. In addition, stimulation of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization was a result of BMS-777607 inducing the expression of Runx2 and Col1, and this osteogenic ability, at least in part, was mediated through the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in vitro. Conclusively, BMS-777607 has been identified as a therapeutic agent to improve bone formation during fracture healing, and its osteogenic effects on osteoblast differentiation were mediated via the mTORC1 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Retinoblastoma (RB) is a primary intraocular malignancy in childhood, and may develop relapse and metastatic disease. This study was to identify the stem-cell properties of primary retinoblastoma cells critical to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Primary cells were isolated from fresh human RB tissues after enucleation, and cultured in serum-free or serum-enriched conditions, with two RB cell-lines Weri-RB1 and Y79 for comparison. Proliferation of primary RB cells were well-maintained in serum-free condition of DMEM/F12 medium, and formed stem-cell like spheroids. The immaturity of cultured primary RB cells was demonstrated by tendency of highly expressed stem-cell markers (CD133, Nestin and OCT4) and suppressed mature retinal-cell markers (GFAP, MAP2 and Recoverin). CD133, a neural stem-cell marker being exclusively studied in RB, was found positive in small patches of cells in archival human RB by immunohistochemistry. Meanwhile, at initial isolation, insignificant CD133+ cells were detected by flow-cytometry, and substantial increase of positivity was observed after several days cultivated in serum-free condition. Cultured primary RB cells were engrafted in subretinal region of BALB/c nude mice for assessment of tumorigenicity. Strong tumorigenic activity and extensive progression of the xenograft retinoblastoma was induced by primary cells as compared with the two cell-lines. Again, immunohistochemistry confirmed that the stem-cell markers were emphasized in the xenograft tumor in mice. Our findings demonstrated that in comparison to the well-established RB cell-lines, cultured primary RB cells possess stem-cell like properties with highly expressed stem-cell markers, self-regenerative growth in culture, and strong in vivo oncogenic potentiality.

Abstract: Paget's disease (PD) features abnormal osteoclasts (OC) which sharply increase in number and size and then intensely induce bone resorption. The purpose of this study was to determine the direct effects of canine distemper virus (CDV) and its fusion protein and hemagglutinin protein (F + H) on receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) induced OC formation in vitro. Immunofluorescence assay, OC morphological and functional detection, intracellular signaling pathway detection, Real-time PCR analysis and ELISA were applied in this study. Immunofluorescence assay provided the conclusive proof that CDV can infect and replicate in RAW264.7 mouse monocyte cell line, primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and their further fused OC. Both CDV and F + H significantly promoted OC formation and bone resorption ability induced by RANKL. Meanwhile, intracellular signaling transduction analysis revealed CDV and F + H specifically upregulated the phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced by RANKL, respectively. Furthermore, without RANKL stimulation, both CDV and F + H slightly induced OC-like cells formation in RAW264.7 cell line even in the presence of NF-κB inhibitor. F + H upregulate OC differentiation and activity through modulation of NF-κB signaling pathway, and induce OC precursor cells merging dependent on the function of glycoproteins themselves. These results meant that F and H proteins play a pivotal role in CDV supporting OC formation. Moreover, this work further provide a new research direction that F and H proteins in CDV should be considered as a trigger during the pathogenesis of PD.

Abstract: Summary
Human cancers require fatty acid synthase (FASN)-dependent de novo long-chain fatty acid synthesis for proliferation. FASN is therefore an attractive drug target, but fast technologies for reliable label-free cellular compound profiling are lacking. Recently, MALDI-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has emerged as an effective technology for discovery of recombinant protein target inhibitors. Here we present an automated, mechanistic MALDI-MS cell assay, which monitors accumulation of the FASN substrate, malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA), in whole cells with limited sample preparation. Profiling of inhibitors, including unpublished compounds, identified compound 1 as the most potent FASN inhibitor (1 nM in A549 cells) discovered to date. Moreover, cellular MALDI-MS assays enable parallel profiling of additional pathway metabolites. Surprisingly, several compounds triggered cytidine 5’-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline) but not malonyl-CoA accumulation indicating that they inhibit diacylglycerol generation but not FASN activity. Taken together, our study suggests that MALDI-MS cell assays may become important tools in drug profiling that provide additional mechanistic insights concerning compound action on metabolic pathways.

Abstract: Although two- and three-dimensional in vitro studies of breast tumor cell lines have increased our knowledge on tumor growth and metastasis formation, the complex in vivo microenvironment is not taken into consideration. The goal of our study was to illustrate the in vivo morphology and motility of widely used breast tumor cell lines. Intravital microscopy allows real-time visualization of individual cells inside tissues of living animals. We used this technique to study breast cancer migration in the complex orthotopic microenvironment. More specifically, we characterized cell morphology, cell-cell interactions, polarity and motility of mouse tumor cell lines 4T1 and mILC-1 and human tumor cell lines MDA-MB-231 and T47D. Almost all measured parameters were remarkably heterogeneous even between positions within the same tumor. Migrating tumor cells were circular in all tumor models, indicating predominantly amoeboid motility. This overview of the in vivo characteristics of mouse and human breast tumor cell lines illustrates their heterogeneity and complexity in real life, and additionally exemplifies caution should be taken to extrapolate in vitro assays of tumor invasiveness.

Abstract: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as a major intercellular communication system engaged in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) are a subset of EVs of special interest as potential cancer biomarkers. Supernatants of tumor cell lines are widely used as the source of pure TEX for molecular/genetic studies. To optimize TEX isolation and characterization for these studies, we evaluated culture conditions for different tumor cell lines and used mini size exclusion chromatography (mini-SEC) for TEX isolation. Each tumor cell line showed unique culture requirements that determined the recovery, purity and total yield of TEX. Culture conditions for optimal TEX purity and recovery by mini-SEC could be modified by altering the media composition and numbers of seeded cells. TEX recovered from mini-SEC fraction #4 under optimized conditions were biologically active, were sized from 30 to 150 nm in diameter, had a typical vesicular morphology and carried endocytic markers. The most critical requirement for reproducible exosome recovery was re-seeding of tumor cells in numbers adjusted to reflect the optimized culture conditions for each tumor cell line. This study provides insights into a cell culture technique, which can be optimized for exosome production by various human or mouse tumor cell lines for isolation by mini-SEC.

Abstract: Cell-based therapeutic strategies afford major potential advantages in the repair of injured tendons. Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) expands cell sources for “regenerative” therapy. However, its application in tendon repair is still limited and the effects remain unclear. In this study, equine tenocyte-derived iPSCs (teno-iPSCs) were generated by expressing four Yamanaka factors. Compared to parental tenocytes and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), the transcriptional activities of lineage-specific genes, including Mkx, Col1A2, Col14, DCN, ELN, FMOD, and TNC, were highly repressed in the resulting teno-iPSCs. Exposure to cyclic uniaxial mechanical loading increased the expression of Scx, Egr1, Col1A2, DCN, and TNC in teno-iPSCs and the expression of Scx, Egr1, DCN, and TNC in BMSCs. Reintroduction of tenogenic transcription factor Mohawk (Mkx) upregulated the expression of DCN in teno-iPSCs and the expression of Scx, Col14, and FMOD in BMSCs. Mechanical loading combined with ectopic expression of equine Mkx further enhanced the expression of Egr1, Col1A2, DCN, and TNC in teno-iPSCs and the expression of Scx, Egr1, and TNC in BMSCs. These data suggest that the repressed lineage-specific genes in the teno-iPSCs can be re-activated by mechanical loading and ectopic expression of Mkx. Our findings offer new insights into the application of iPSCs for basic and clinic research in tendon repair.

Abstract: Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3)-modified mitochondrial fission participates in the progression of several types of cancers. However, its role in tongue cancer requires investigation. The aim of our study is to determine whether Sirt3 knockdown regulates the viability of tongue cancer cells via modulating mitochondrial fission. Two types of tongue cancer cells were used in the present study, and siRNA was transfected into the cells to suppress Sirt3 expression. Mitochondrial function and cell apoptosis were determined via immunofluorescence, Western blotting, ELISA, and qPCR assays. A pathway blocker was applied to verify the role of the JNK-Fis1 signaling pathway in regulation of mitochondrial fission. The present study showed that loss of Sirt3 promoted tongue cancer cell death in a manner dependent on mitochondrial apoptosis. Mitochondrial oxidative stress, energy metabolism disorder, mitochondrial cyt-c liberation, and mitochondrial apoptosis activation were observed after Sirt3 silencing. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Sirt3 knockdown activated mitochondrial stress via triggering Fis1-related mitochondrial fission and that inhibition of Fis1-related mitochondrial fission abrogated the pro-apoptotic effect of Sirt3 knockdown on tongue cancer cells. To this end, we found that Sirt3 modulated Fis1 expression via the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) signaling pathway and that blockade of the JNK pathway attenuated mitochondrial stress and repressed apoptosis in Sirt3 knockdown cells. Altogether, our results identified a tumor-suppressive role for Sirt3 deficiency in tongue cancer via activation of the JNK-Fis1 axis and subsequent initiation of fatal mitochondrial fission. Given these findings, strategies to repress Sirt3 activity and enhance the JNK-Fis1-mitochondrial fission cascade have clinical benefits for patients with tongue cancer.

Abstract: We previously reported that the Bcl-2 family member human Bcl-rambo, also known as BCL2L13, induces apoptosis in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Mouse Bcl-rambo has recently been reported to mediate mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy. In the present study, we showed that the transfection of human Bcl-rambo and its microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-interacting region motif mutant (W276A/I279A) caused mitochondrial fragmentation and the perinuclear accumulation of fragmented mitochondria in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. In comprehensive screening using the Drosophila model in which human Bcl-rambo was ectopically expressed in eye imaginal discs, voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC), also known as mitochondrial porin, were found to manifest a genetic interaction with human Bcl-rambo. In addition to human adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) 1 and ANT2, the human Bcl-rambo protein bound to human VDAC1, albeit to a lesser extent than ANT2. Moreover, human VDAC1 and human VDAC2 in particular promoted the activation of effector caspases only when they were co-expressed with human Bcl-rambo in 293T cells. Bcl-rambo induced the perinuclear accumulation of fragmented mitochondria by the knockdown of VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3 in A549 cells. Thus, the present study revealed that human Bcl-rambo and VDAC cooperatively promote the activation of effector caspases in human cultured cells.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that autophagy exhibits a protective role in acute kidney injury (AKI), and the accumulation of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) participates in the progression of kidney diseases. Our previous study indicated that AOPP induced injury in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) through autophagy inhibition. Besides, we found that human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) enhanced autophagy in AOPP-treated RTECs, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We regulated microRNA-145 (miR-145) expression in HK-2 cells (a cell line of RTECs), or co-cultured hUC-MSCs with HK-2 cells and studied the autophagic activity in HK-2 cells to explore the underlying mechanism. Our data demonstrated that upregulated miR-145 increased LC3 II and Beclin 1 levels, decreased p62 level, three autophagy related proteins, inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and increased LC3B-positive staining and the autophagosome number. Furthermore, hUC-MSCs enhanced autophagy and inhibited phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR in AOPP-treated HK-2 cells, which was then partially rescued using miR-145 knockdown in the hUC-MSCs co-culture system. In conclusion, our study showed that hUC-MSCs enhanced autophagy in AOPP-treated HK-2 cells mediated by miR-145 via inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which indicated that hUC-MSCs might serve as a prospective therapy for AKI.

Abstract: Summary
Nutrient uptake is essential for survival of organisms, and carbohydrates serve as a crucial carbon and energy source for most microorganisms. Given the importance of mycobacteria as human pathogens a detailed knowledge of carbohydrate uptake transporters is highly desirable, but currently available information is severely limited and mainly based on in silico analyses. Moreover, there is only very little data available on the in vitro characterization of carbohydrate transporters from mycobacterial species. To overcome these significant limitations there is a strong demand for innovative approaches to experimentally match substrates to ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in a straightforward manner. Our study focuses on the model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis and identifies a mycobacterial ABC transport system based on a rapid label-free mass spectrometry lipoproteomics assay with broad applicability. Further validation and X-ray structure analyses reveal a highly selective mycobacterial L-arabinose uptake system.

Abstract: Summary
Myeloid-differentiated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have contributed to a number of novel treatment approaches for lysosomal storage diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), and may also be applied to patients infected with HIV. We quantified hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) trafficking to 20 tissues including lymph nodes, spleen, liver, gastrointestinal tract, CNS, and reproductive tissues. We observed efficient marking of multiple macrophage subsets, including CNS-associated myeloid cells, suggesting that HSPC-derived macrophages are a viable approach to target gene-modified cells to tissues. Gene-marked cells in the CNS were unique from gene-marked cells at any other physiological sites including peripheral blood. This novel finding suggests that these cells were derived from HSPCs, migrated to the brain, were compartmentalized, established myeloid progeny, and could be targeted for lifelong delivery of therapeutic molecules. Our findings have highly relevant implications for the development of novel therapies for genetic and infectious diseases of the CNS.

Abstract: GBM cells can easily gain resistance to conventional therapy, and therefore treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is difficult. One of the hallmark proteins known to be responsible for this resistance is heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) which has a key role in the cell survival. Resveratrol, a natural compound, exhibits antitumor effects against GBM, but there are no reports regarding its effect on Hsp27 expression in gliomas. The aim of the present study was to asses the effect of resveratrol on Hsp27 expression and apoptosis in non-transfected and transfected U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells. In order to block the Hsp27 expression, siRNA transfection was performed. Non-transfected and transfected cells were treated with either 10 or 15μm resveratrol. The effects of resveratrol were compared with quercetin, a well-known Hsp27 inhibitor. Resveratrol was found to induce apoptosis more effectively than quercetin. Our data showed that resveratrol induces dose- and time-dependent cell death. We also determined that silencing of Hsp27 with siRNA makes the cells more vulnerable to apoptosis upon resveratrol treatment. The highest effect was observed in the 15μm resveratrol and 25 nM siRNA combination group (suppressed Hsp27 expression by 93.4% and induced apoptosis by 101.2%). This study is the first report showing that resveratrol reduces Hsp27 levels, and siRNA-mediated Hsp27 silencing enhances the therapeutic effects of resveratrol in glioma cells. Our results suggest that resveratrol administration in combination with Hsp27 silencing has a potential to be used as a candidate for GBM treatment.

Abstract: Summary
The proper staining of the plasma membrane (PM) is critical in bioimaging as it delimits the cell. Herein, we developed MemBright, a family of six cyanine-based fluorescent turn-on PM probes that emit from orange to near infrared when reaching the PM, and enable homogeneous and selective PM staining with excellent contrast in mono- and two-photon microscopy. These probes are compatible with long-term live-cell imaging and immunostaining. Moreover, MemBright label neurons in a brighter manner than surrounding cells, allowing identification of neurons in acute brain tissue sections and neuromuscular junctions without any use of transfection or transgenic animals. In addition, MemBright probes were used in super-resolution imaging to unravel the neck of dendritic spines. 3D multicolor dSTORM in combination with immunostaining revealed en-passant synapse displaying endogenous glutamate receptors clustered at the axonal-dendritic contact site. MemBright probes thus constitute a universal toolkit for cell biology and neuroscience biomembrane imaging with a variety of microscopy techniques.
