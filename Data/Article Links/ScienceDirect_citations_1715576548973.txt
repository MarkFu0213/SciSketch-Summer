Abstract: Millions of deaths a year across the globe are linked to antimicrobial resistant infections. The need to develop new treatments and repurpose of existing antibiotics grows more pressing as the growing antimicrobial resistance pandemic advances. In this review article, we propose that envelope stress responses, the signaling pathways bacteria use to recognize and adapt to damage to the most vulnerable outer compartments of the microbial cell, are attractive targets. Envelope stress responses (ESRs) support colonization and infection by responding to a plethora of toxic envelope stresses encountered throughout the body; they have been co-opted into virulence networks where they work like global positioning systems to coordinate adhesion, invasion, microbial warfare, and biofilm formation. We highlight progress in the development of therapeutic strategies that target ESR signaling proteins and adaptive networks and posit that further characterization of the molecular mechanisms governing these essential niche adaptation machineries will be important for sparking new therapeutic approaches aimed at short-circuiting bacterial adaptation.

Abstract: The membrane insertase YidC, is an essential bacterial component and functions in the folding and insertion of many membrane proteins during their biogenesis. It is a multispanning protein in the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane of Escherichia coli that binds its substrates in the “greasy slide” through hydrophobic interaction. The hydrophilic part of the substrate transiently localizes in the groove of YidC before it is translocated into the periplasm. The groove, which is flanked by the greasy slide, is within the center of the membrane, and provides a promising target for inhibitors that would block the insertase function of YidC. In addition, since the greasy slide is available for the binding of various substrates, it could also provide a binding site for inhibitory molecules. In this review we discuss in detail the structure and the mechanism of how YidC interacts not only with its substrates, but also with its partner proteins, the SecYEG translocase and the SRP signal recognition particle. Insight into the substrate binding to the YidC catalytic groove is presented. We wind up the review with the idea that the hydrophilic groove would be a potential site for drug binding and the feasibility of YidC-targeted drug development.

Abstract: 20-Hydroxyecdysone (20E) is known to have numerous pharmacological activities and can be used to treat diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, the protective effects of 20E against endothelial dysfunction and its targets remain unclear. In the present study, we revealed that 20E treatment could modulate the release of the endothelium-derived vasomotor factors NO, PGI2 and ET-1 and suppress the expression of ACE in TNF-α-induced 3D-cultured HUVECs. In addition, 20E suppressed the expression of CD40 and promoted the expression of SIRT6 in TNF-α-induced 3D-cultured HUVECs. The cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) and molecular docking results demonstrated that 20E binding increased SIRT6 stability, indicating that 20E directly bound to SIRT6 in HUVECs. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism showed that 20E could upregulate SIRT6 levels and that SIRT6 knockdown abolished the regulatory effect of 20E on CD40 in TNF-α-induced HUVECs, while SIRT6 overexpression further improved the effect of 20E. Moreover, we found that 20E could reduce the acetylation of NF-κB p65 (K310) through SIRT6, but the catalytic inactive mutant SIRT6 (H133Y) did not promote the deacetylation of NF-κB p65, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of 20E on NF-κB p65 was dependent on SIRT6 deacetylase activity. Additionally, our results indicated that 20E inhibited NF-κB via SIRT6, and the expression of CD40 was increased in HUVECs treated with SIRT6 siRNA and NF-κB inhibitor. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that 20E exerts its effect through SIRT6-mediated deacetylation of NF-κB p65 (K310) to inhibit CD40 expression in ECs, and 20E may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: Centrins are cytoskeletal proteins associated with the centrosomes or basal bodies in the eukaryotes. We previously reported the involvement of Centrin 1–3 proteins in cell division in the protozoan parasites Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma brucei. Centrin4 and 5, unique to such parasites, had never been characterized in Leishmania parasite. In the current study, we addressed the function of centrin4 (LdCen4) in Leishmania. By dominant-negative study, the episomal expression of C-terminal truncated LdCen4 in the parasite reduced the parasite growth. LdCen4 double allele gene deletion by either homologous recombination or CRISPR-Cas9 was not successful in L. donovani. However, CRISPR-Cas9-based deletion of the homologous gene was possible in L. mexicana, which attenuated the parasite growth in vitro, but not ex vivo in the macrophages. LdCen4 also interacts with endogenous and overexpressed LdPOC protein, a homolog of centrin reacting human POC (protein of centriole) in a calcium sensitive manner. LdCen4 and LdPOC binding has also been confirmed through in silico analysis by protein structural docking and validated by co-immunoprecipitation. By immunofluorescence studies, we found that both the proteins share a common localization at the basal bodies. Thus, for the first time, this article describes novel centrin4 and its binding protein in the protozoan parasites.

Abstract: Protective effects of exendin-4 (glucagon-like peptide-1 -GLP-1- receptor agonist) and des-fluoro-sitagliptin (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor) on fructose-induced hepatic disturbances were evaluated in prediabetic rats. Complementary, a possible direct effect of exendin-4 in human hepatoblastoma-derived cell line HepG2 incubated with fructose in presence/absence of exendin-9-39 (GLP-1 receptor antagonist) was investigated. In vivo, after 21 days of fructose rich diet, we determined: glycemia, insulinemia, and triglyceridemia; hepatic fructokinase, AMP-deaminase, and G-6-P dehydrogenase (G-6-P DH) activities; carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) expression; triglyceride content and lipogenic gene expression (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase -GPAT-, fatty acid synthase -FAS-, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c -SREBP-1c); oxidative stress and inflammatory markers expression. In HepG2 cells we measured fructokinase activity and triglyceride content. Hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, enhanced liver fructokinase, AMP-deaminase, and G-6-P DH activities, increased ChREBP and lipogenic genes expression, enhanced triglyceride level, oxidative stress and inflammatory markers recorded in fructose fed animals, were prevented by co-administration of either exendin-4 or des-fluoro-sitagliptin. Exendin-4 prevented fructose-induced increase in fructokinase activity and triglyceride contain in HepG2 cells. These effects were blunted co-incubating with exendin-9-39. The results demonstrated for the first time that exendin-4/des-fluro-sitagliptin prevented fructose-induced endocrine-metabolic oxidative stress and inflammatory changes probably acting on the purine degradation pathway. Exendin 9–39 blunted in vitro protective exendin-4 effects, thereby suggesting a direct effect of this compound on hepatocytes through GLP-1 receptor. Direct effect on fructokinase and AMP-deaminase activities, with a key role in the pathogenesis of liver dysfunction induced by fructose, suggests purine degradation pathway constitute a potential therapeutic objective for GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Abstract: CASP8 and FADD Like Apoptosis Regulator (CFLAR) is a key anti-apoptotic regulator for resistance to apoptosis mediated by Fas and TRAIL. In addition to its anti-apoptotic function, CFLAR is also an important mediator of tumor growth. High level of CFLAR expression correlates with a more aggressive tumor. However, the mechanism of CFLAR signaling in malignant progression is not clear. Here we report a novel CFLAR-associated protein p130Cas, which is a general regulator of cell growth and cell migration. CFLAR-p130Cas association is mediated by the DED domain of CFLAR and the SD domain of p130Cas. Immunofluorescence observation showed that CFLAR had the colocalization with p130Cas at the focal adhesion of cell membrane. CFLAR overexpression promoted p130Cas phosphorylation and the formation of focal adhesion complex. Moreover, the enhancement of cell migration induced by CFLAR overexpression was obviously inhibited by p130Cas siRNA. In silico analysis on human database suggests high expressions of CFLAR or/and p130Cas are associated with poor prognosis of patients with lung cancer. Together, our results suggest a new mechanism for CFLAR involved in tumor development via association with p130Cas.

Abstract: Palmitic acid (PA), the most common statured fatty acid in diets, is involved in peripheral as well as central inflammation. The M1 polarization of microglia plays an important role in PA-induced neuroinflammation. However, it is still unclear on the key factor and molecule mechanism of microglial polarization among it. Thus, we investigated whether the release of self-DNA into the cytoplasm of microglia was a consequence of PA treatment, as in aortic endothelial cells and adipocytes. RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence were performed to detect the status of cytosolic DNA and microglial polarization after PA treatment. We found that the content of cytosolic nDNA rather than mtDNA increased after PA treatment and the M1 polarization of microglia was associated with this. Moreover, the knockdown of cGAS in BV2 microglial cells demonstrated that the cGAS-STING pathway is involved in polarization process. Our results revealed that nDNA and cGAS-STING pathway are critically involved in PA-induced microglial M1 polarization. This mechanism may pose a new insight on targeting microglia may be a promising way to mitigate diet-induced early neuroinflammation.

Abstract: Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is a crucial regulator of the cell cycle checkpoint and activated in response to DNA replication stress by two independent pathways via RPA32-ETAA1 and TopBP1. However, the precise activation mechanism of ATR by the RPA32-ETAA1 pathway remains unclear. Here, we show that p130RB2, a member of the retinoblastoma protein family, participates in the pathway under hydroxyurea-induced DNA replication stress. p130RB2 binds to ETAA1, but not TopBP1, and depletion of p130RB2 inhibits the RPA32-ETAA1 interaction under replication stress. Moreover, p130RB2 depletion reduces ATR activation accompanied by phosphorylation of its targets RPA32, Chk1, and ATR itself. It also causes improper re-progression of S phase with retaining single-stranded DNA after cancelation of the stress, which leads to an increase in the anaphase bridge phenotype and a decrease in cell survival. Importantly, restoration of p130RB2 rescued the disrupted phenotypes of p130RB2 knockdown cells. These results suggest positive involvement of p130RB2 in the RPA32-ETAA1-ATR axis and proper re-progression of the cell cycle to maintain genome integrity.

Abstract: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is one of the most common etiologies in many diseases. Retinal I/R leads to cytokine storm, resulting in tissue damage and cell death. Pyroptosis, a novel type of regulated cell death, occurs after cellular I/R injury. In this study, we established an oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD/R) cellular model (R28) to simulate retinal I/R injury. We conducted an LDH assay, and EthD-III and PI staining procedures to confirm pyroptosis. Mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis were used to identify the possible proteins interacting with NLRP3. Co-IP and various molecular biology techniques were used to investigate the possible modes regulating NLRP3 by DTX3L. EthD-III, PI staining and LDH assays demonstrated pyroptosis induced by OGD/R injury, mediated via NLRP3 pathway. Mass spectrometry and bioinformatics analysis screened out three candidate proteins interacting with NLRP3, and further Co-IP experiment indicated that DTX-3L may interact with NLRP3 to regulate its protein levels after injury. Co-IP experiments and various molecular biology methods demonstrated that DTX3L ubiquitinates NLRP3 resulting in pyroptosis after R28 OGD/R injury. Further, NLRP3 LRR and DTX3L RING domains interact with each other. Our study demonstrated that DTX3L may ubiquitinate NLRP3 to regulate OGD/R-induced pyroptosis globally in R28 cells.

Abstract: Sulfhemoglobinemia is an incurable disease caused by an overdose of sulfur-containing drugs with oxidizing properties. Its diagnosis remains hindered due to the similarity of symptoms to other pathological state – methemoglobinemia, as well as contradictory information on the structure and characteristics of sulfhemoglobin. Herein, we present sulfhemoglobinemia model on living functional human erythrocytes, designed to recreate processes which could take place in a patient body in order to complement missing information and highlight distinctiveness of two hemoglobin (Hb) adducts formed after interaction with sulfur donors. Employed techniques, UV–Vis absorption, Raman, Fourier transformed infrared (FT–IR) and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopies, allowed to distinguish and characterize Hb adduct with sulfur atom bounded directly to the iron ion (HbFeIII–SH), and irreversibly connected to the porphyrin ring (SHb – sulfhemoglobin). Presented herein results provided also new evidence on formation of both these hemoglobin adducts inside functional erythrocytes under oxidative conditions and during sulfur-containing drug presence, what can be further translated into future physiological studies. Moreover, we found that sulfur attachment to the porphyrin ring altered Hb structure and lead to changes in protein packing inside RBCs, eventually. Interestingly, measurement of blood drop smear by Raman spectroscopy occurred the most accurate method to differentiate HbFeIII–SH and SHb, indicating potential of this technique in sulfhemoglobinemia diagnosis.

Abstract: As an anticancer drug, cisplatin is widely used, but its clinical application is restricted due to its severe side effects of ototoxicity. Therefore, this study was dedicated to assessing the benefit of ginsenoside extract, 20(S)-Ginsenoside Rh1 (Rh1), on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. HEI-OC1 cells and neonatal cochlear explants were cultured. Cleaved caspase-3, TUNEL, and MitoSOX Red were observed in vitro by immunofluorescence staining. CCK8 and LDH cytotoxicity assays were detected to measure cell viability and cytotoxicity. Our results showed that Rh1 significantly increased cell viability, reduced cytotoxicity, and alleviated cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In addition, Rh1 pretreatment decreased the excessive accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Mechanistic studies indicated that Rh1 pretreatment reversed the increase of apoptotic protein expression, accumulation of mitochondrial ROS, and activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. These results suggested that Rh1 can act as an antioxidant and anti-apoptotic agent against cisplatin-induced hearing loss by suppressing the excessive accumulation of mitochondrial ROS, activation of MAPK signaling pathway and apoptosis.

Abstract: Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a major downstream effector molecule of mTORC1, regulates cell growth and proliferation by modulating protein translation and ribosome biogenesis. We have recently identified eIF4E as an intermediate in transducing signals from mTORC1 to S6K1 and further demonstrated that the role of mTORC1 is restricted to inducing eIF4E phosphorylation and interaction with S6K1. This interaction relieves S6K1 auto-inhibition and facilitates its hydrophobic motif (HM) phosphorylation and activation as a consequence. These observations underscore a possible involvement of mTORC1 independent kinase in mediating HM phosphorylation. Here, we report mTORC2 as an in-vivo/physiological HM kinase of S6K1. We show that rapamycin-resistant S6K1 truncation mutant ∆NH∆CT continues to display HM phosphorylation with selective sensitivity toward Torin-1. We also show that HM phosphorylation of wildtype S6K1and ∆NH∆CT depends on the presence of mTORC2 regulatory subunit-rictor. Furthermore, truncation mutagenesis and molecular docking analysis reveal the involvement of a conserved 19 amino acid stretch of S6K1 in mediating interaction with rictor. We finally show that deletion of the 19 amino acid region from wildtype S6K1 results in loss of interaction with rictor, with a resultant loss of HM phosphorylation regardless of the presence of functional TOS motif. Our data demonstrate that mTORC2 acts as a physiological HM kinase that can activate S6K1 after its auto-inhibition is overcome by mTORC1. We, therefore, propose a novel mechanism for S6K1 regulation where mTOR complexes 1 and 2 act in tandem to activate the enzyme.

Abstract: β1,4-galactosyltransferase-1 (β4GalT1) is a type II membrane protein that catalyzes the transfer of galactose (Gal) from UDP-Gal to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and forms a LacNAc structure. β4GalT1 has a long form (termed β4GalT1-L) and a short form (termed β4GalT1-S) in mammalian cells. Although β4GalT1 has been proven to play an important role in many biological and pathological processes, such as differentiation, immune responses and cancer development, the different functions of the two β4GalT1 forms remain ambiguous. In this study, we demonstrated that total β4GalT1 was upregulated in bladder cancer. Overexpression of β4GalT1-S, but not β4GalT1-L, increased drug resistance in bladder epithelial cells by upregulating p53 expression. Glycoproteomic analysis revealed that the substrate specificities of the two β4GalT1 forms were different. Among the LacNAcylated proteins, the E3 ligase MDM2 could be preferentially modified by β4GalT1-L compared to β4GalT1-S, and this modification could increase the binding of MDM2 and p53 and further facilitate the degradation of p53. Our data proved that the two forms of β4GalT1 could synergistically regulate p53-mediated cell survival under chemotherapy treatment. These results provide insights into the role of β4GalT1-L and β4GalT1-S and suggest their differentially important implications in the development of bladder cancer.

Abstract: The potential role of polycomb chromobox 4 (Cbx4), as a small ubiquitin-like ligase (SUMO) E3 ligase, in the development and exacerbation of asthma remains unclear. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a key transcription factor in the cellular response to hypoxia and contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of a range of diseases, including asthma. Here, we aimed to investigate the interaction of Cbx4 with Hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and the potent mechanism of action in asthma progression. In present study, in vitro and ex vivo results demonstrated that Cbx4 interacts with HIF-1α protein through its SUMO E3 ligase activity and enhances the sumoylation, which increases HIF-1 transactivation through Cbx4 and promotes the differentiation of Th9 cells, then in turn promotes the process of asthma. Treatment of inhibitors targeting SUMO E3 ligase activity of Cbx4 or HIF-1α can effectively reduce HIF-1α activation and differentiation of Th9 cells, which further attenuates the asthma in mouse model. Current results collectively demonstrated Cbx4 can govern HIF-1α to involve in Th9 cell differentiation promoting asthma by its SUMO E3 ligase activity, providing a new direction for clinical treatment of asthma.

Abstract: Antibiotic resistant bacterial infections are now a leading cause of global mortality. While drug resistance continues to spread, the clinical antibiotic pipeline has become bare. This discord has focused attention on developing new strategies for antimicrobial discovery. Natural macrocyclic peptide-based products have provided novel antibiotics and antibiotic scaffolds targeting several essential bacterial cell envelope processes, but discovery of such natural products remains a slow and inefficient process. Synthetic strategies employing peptide display technologies can quickly screen large libraries of macrocyclic sequences for specific target binding and general antibacterial potential providing alternative approaches for new antibiotic discovery. Here we review cell envelope processes that can be targeted with macrocyclic peptide therapeutics, outline important macrocyclic peptide display technologies, and discuss future strategies for both library design and screening.

Abstract: Rotenone has widespread beneficial effects in agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandries; however prolonged exposure causes a detrimental effect on the health of personnel working in such industries. Rotenone during its extraction, formulation or usage may cross the blood brain barrier leading to neurodegeneration and the development of Parkinson's disease like symptoms. It is a known inhibitor of the mitochondrial ETC complex I and responsible for impairing the OXPHOS system. Our study showed that rotenone exposure results in an increased production of ROS and decreased ATP level along with a conspicuous loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in N2A cells. The transcription and expression pattern of cofilin, a key component of actin cytoskeleton, was also altered after rotenone exposure; leading to the actin cytoskeleton degradation. We further observed an increased expression, as well as activity of matrix metalloproteinase9 (MMP9) in rotenone exposed N2A cells; suggesting the involvement of inflammation upon rotenone exposure. Simultaneously, an opposite pattern was noticed for the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) protein, which is a known modulator of MMP9 activity. Additionally, the localization of MMP9 along with alpha-synuclein, UCHL1 and cofilin suggested their close proximity and cross interaction upon rotenone treatment. Furthermore, we observed significant increase in the level of TNF-α upon rotenone exposure along with the phosphorylation of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL that has been identified as the necroptosis markers leading to programmed necroptotic death.

Abstract: Salivary glands are physiologically orchestrated by the coordinated balance between cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and interactions between epithelial, mesenchymal endothelial, and neuronal cells, and they are frequent sites of manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome (SS) or IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). However, little is known about salivary gland homeostasis and its involvement in those diseases. Inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation 4 (Id4) is an Id protein involved in the transcriptional control of many biological events, including differentiation. Studies of Id4-deficient mice revealed that Id4-deficient submandibular glands were smaller and exhibited accelerated differentiation, compared with those from wild-type littermates. In addition, dry mouth symptoms and Th17 expansion in splenocytes were also observed in the absence of Id4. Furthermore, Id4 levels in the salivary glands of patients with IgG4-RD, but not SS, were significantly decreased compared with those of healthy controls. miRNA-mRNA integrated analysis demonstrated that miR-486-5p was upregulated in IgG4-RD patients and that it might regulate Id4 in the lesion sites. Together, these results provide evidence for the inhibitory role of Id4 in salivary differentiation, and a critical association between Id4 downregulation and IgG4-RD.

Abstract: Decreased autophagic flux in cardiomyocytes is an important mechanism by which the β1-adrenoreceptor (β1-AR) autoantibody (β1-AA) induces heart failure. A previous study found that β1-AA imparts its biological effects via the β1-AR/Gs/AC/cAMP/PKA canonical signaling pathway, but PKA inhibition does not completely reverse β1-AA-induced reduction in autophagy in myocardial tissues, suggesting that other signaling molecules participate in this process. This study confirmed that Epac1 upregulation is indeed involved β1-AA-induced decreased cardiomyocyte autophagy through CE3F4 pretreatment, Epac1 siRNA transfection, western blot and immunofluorescence methods. On this basis, we constructed β1-AR and β2-AR knockout mice, and used receptor knockout mice, β1-AR selective blocker (atenolol), and the β2-AR/Gi-biased agonist ICI 118551 to show that β1-AA upregulated Epac1 expression through β1-AR and β2-AR to inhibit autophagy, and biased activation of β2-AR/Gi signaling downregulated myocardial Epac1 expression to reverse β1-AA-induced myocardial autophagy inhibition. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that Epac1 acts as another effector downstream of cAMP on β1-AA-induced reduction in cardiomyocyte autophagy, and β1-AA upregulates myocardial Epac1 expression through β1-AR and β2-AR, and biased activation of the β2-AR/Gi signaling pathway can reverse β1-AA-induced myocardial autophagy inhibition. This study provides new ideas and therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases related to dysregulated autophagy.

Abstract: Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are intracellular lipid-binding proteins that play roles in fatty acid transport and the regulation of gene expression. Dysregulated FABP expression and/or activity have been associated with cancer pathogenesis; in particular, epidermal-type FABP (FABP5) is upregulated in many types of cancer. However, the mechanisms regulating FABP5 expression and its involvement in cancer remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the regulation of FABP5 gene expression in non-metastatic and metastatic human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. We found that FABP5 expression was upregulated in metastatic compared with non-metastatic CRC cells as well as in human CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissue. Analysis of the DNA methylation status of the FABP5 promoter showed that hypomethylation correlated with the malignant potential of the CRC cell lines. Moreover, FABP5 promoter hypomethylation also correlated with the expression pattern of splice variants of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B. ChIP assays and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) was involved in regulating FABP5 expression. FABP5 expression could be upregulated in metastatic CRC cells by sequential promotion of DNA demethylation followed by activation of NF-κB. We also found that upregulated FABP5 in turn controlled NF-κB activity through IL-8 production. Collectively, these findings suggest the existence of a DNA methylation-dependent NF-κB /FABP5 positive feed-forward loop that may lead to constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling pathway and play a crucial role in CRC progression.

Abstract: Filamentous fungi undergo significant cellular morphological changes during their life cycle. It has recently been reported that deletions of genes that are involved in phospholipid synthesis led to abnormal hyphal morphology and differentiation in filamentous fungi. Although these results suggest the importance of phospholipid balance in their life cycle, comprehensive analyses of cellular phospholipids are limited. Here, we performed lipidomic analysis of A. nidulans during morphological changes in a liquid medium and of colonies on a solid medium. We observed that the phospholipid composition and transcription of the genes involved in phospholipid synthesis changed dynamically during the life cycle. Specifically, the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine, and highly unsaturated phospholipids increased during the establishment of polarity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the phospholipid composition in the hyphae at colony margins is similar to that during conidial germination. Furthermore, we demonstrated that common and characteristic phospholipid changes occurred during germination in A. nidulans and A. oryzae, and that species-specific changes also occurred. These results suggest that the exquisite regulation of phospholipid composition is crucial for the growth and differentiation of filamentous fungi.

Abstract: Cells with the desired phenotype and number are critical for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Uniparental parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells (pESCs) share fundamental properties with embryonic stem cells. This study aims to determine the viability of pESC-based tissue engineering for bone and cartilage reconstruction. The mouse pESCs were cultured in suspension to form embryoid bodies. An adherent cultivation approach was employed to obtain parthenogenetic embryonic mesenchymal stem cells (pMSCs) from the embryoid bodies. Then, the pMSCs were cultured in conditional media to differentiate into osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. The pESC-derived osteoblasts and chondroblasts were seeded into coral and sodium alginate scaffolds, respectively. The cell-seeded scaffolds were implanted into dorsal subcutaneous pockets of nude mice to evaluate ectopic reconstruction of bone and cartilage. We demonstrated that pESCs display the capacity to differentiate into all three germ layers. The generated pMSCs were able to differentiate into osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages, which survived well after seeding into coral and alginate acid scaffolds. Six weeks after cell-scaffold implantation, gross inspection and histological examination revealed that ectopic bone and cartilage tissues had successfully regenerated in the specimen. According to the findings of this study, pESC derivatives have a high potential for bone and cartilage regeneration.

Abstract: Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental and highly regulated process that is normally observed during embryonic development and tissue repair but is deregulated during advanced cancer. Classically, through the process of EMT, cancer cells gradually transition from a predominantly epithelial phenotype to a more invasive mesenchymal phenotype. Increasing studies have, however, brought into light the existence of unique intermediary states in EMT, often referred to as partial EMT states. Through our studies we have found the deubiquitinase USP7 to be strongly associated with the development of such a partial EMT state in colon cancer cells, characterized by the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics but without the reduction in epithelial markers. We found USP7 to be overexpressed in colon adenocarcinomas and to be closely associated with advancing tumor stage. We found that functional inhibition or knockdown of USP7 is associated with a marked reduction in mesenchymal markers and in overall migration potential of cancer cells. Starting off with a proteomics-based approach we were able to identify and later on verify the DEAD box RNA helicase DDX3X to be an interacting partner of USP7. We then went on to show that USP7, through the stabilization of DDX3X, augments Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which has previously been shown to be greatly associated with colorectal cancer cell invasiveness. Our results indicate USP7 as a novel key player in establishing a partial mesenchymal phenotype in colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Pituitary growth hormone (GH) is essential for growth, metabolism, and renal function. Overactive GH signaling is associated with impaired kidney function. Glomerular podocytes, a key kidney cell type, play an indispensable role in the renal filtration and express GH receptors (GHR), suggesting the direct action of GH on these cells. However, the precise mechanism and the downstream signaling events by which GH leads to diabetic nephropathy remain to be elucidated. Here we performed proteome analysis of the condition media from human podocytes and confirmed that GH-induces TGF-β1. Inhibition of GH/GHR stimulated-JAK2 signaling abrogates GH-induced TGF-β1 secretion. Mice administered with GH showed glomerular manifestations concomitant with proteinuria. Pharmacological inhibition of TGF-βR1 in mice prevented GH-induced TGF-β dependent SMAD signaling and proteinuria. Conditional deletion of GHR in podocytes protected mice from streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. GH and TGF-β1 signaling components expression was elevated in the kidneys of human diabetic nephropathy patients. Our study identifies that GH induces TGF-β1 in podocytes, contributing to diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract: Nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) are multitransmembrane proteins, localized in the Golgi apparatus and/or endoplasmic reticulum, which provide glycosylation enzymes with their substrates. It has been demonstrated that NSTs may form complexes with functionally related glycosyltransferases, especially in the N-glycosylation pathway. However, potential interactions of NSTs with enzymes mediating the biosynthesis of mucin-type O-glycans have not been addressed to date. Here we report that UDP-galactose transporter (UGT; SLC35A2) associates with core 1 β-1,3-galactosyltransferase 1 (C1GalT1; T-synthase). This provides the first example of an interaction between an enzyme that acts exclusively in the O-glycosylation pathway and an NST. We also found that SLC35A2 associated with the C1GalT1-specific chaperone Cosmc, and that the endogenous Cosmc was localized in both the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of wild-type HEK293T cells. Furthermore, in SLC35A2-deficient cells protein levels of C1GalT1 and Cosmc were decreased and their Golgi localization was less pronounced. Finally, we identified SLC35A2 as a novel molecular target for the antifungal agent itraconazole. Based on our findings we propose that NSTs may contribute to the stabilization of their interaction partners and help them to achieve target localization in the cell, most likely by facilitating their assembly into larger functional units.

2-Methoxyestradiol-3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamate inhibits store-operated Ca2+ entry in T lymphocytes and prevents experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,

Abstract: Ca2+ signaling is one of the essential signaling systems for T lymphocyte activation, the latter being an essential step in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) ensures long lasting Ca2+ signaling and is of utmost importance for major downstream T lymphocyte activation steps, e.g. nuclear localization of the transcription factor ‘nuclear factor of activated T cells’ (NFAT). 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2), an endogenous metabolite of estradiol (E2), blocks nuclear translocation of NFAT. The likely underlying mechanism is inhibition of SOCE, as shown for its synthetic sulfamate ester analogue 2-ethyl-3-sulfamoyloxy-17β-cyanomethylestra-1,3,5(10)-triene (STX564). Here, we demonstrate that another synthetic bis-sulfamoylated 2ME2 derivative, 2-methoxyestradiol-3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamate (2-MeOE2bisMATE, STX140), an orally bioavailable, multi-targeting anticancer agent and potent steroid sulfatase (STS) inhibitor, antagonized SOCE in T lymphocytes. Downstream events, e.g. secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ and interleukin-17, were decreased by STX140 in in vitro experiments. Remarkably, STX140 dosed in vivo completely blocked the clinical disease in both active and transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats, a T cell-mediated animal model for MS, at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day i.p., whereas neither 2ME2 nor Irosustat, a pure STS inhibitor, showed any effect. The STS inhibitory activity of STX140 is therefore not responsible for its activity in this model. Taken together, inhibition of SOCE by STX140 resulting in full antagonism of clinical symptoms in EAE in the Lewis rat, paired with the known excellent bioavailability and pharmaceutical profile of this drug, open potentially new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of MS.

Abstract: Efferocytosis of non-viable germ cells by Sertoli cells (SCs) constitutes a sentinel for testis homeostasis, yet how SCs signal for the metabolic and cytoskeletal adaption to this energetically costly process remains unexplored. Spectrin is membrane-associated periodic skeleton assembled into an actin-spectrin-based cytoskeletal structure with an interaction with glucose transporter Glut1. The contribution of spectrin to glucose uptake and efferocytosis is unknown. In this study, we identified a cross-regulation between glucose metabolism and efferocytosis in SCs. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of glucose uptake or glycolysis compromises efferocytosis activity. We further found that βII-spectrin is a hitherto unappreciated regulator of glucose metabolism and cytoskeletal architecture. βII-spectrin deficiency impairs glucose uptake and lactate production in SCs. Moreover, a defective assembly of cytoskeleton and a loss of blood-testis barrier integrity are also featured by SCs deficient in βII-spectrin. The disruption in glucose metabolism and cytoskeletal organization synergistically lead to a defective efferocytosis. In vivo siRNA-mediated targeting of βII-spectrin in testis causes an obvious morphological aberration in seminiferous epithelium with the presence of exfoliated germ cells and multinucleated giant cells. Importantly, a decrease in expression of αII/βII-spectrin was observed in testes of Adjudin-induced infertility model. By exploring the functional relevance of βII-spectrin to the metabolic and cytoskeletal regulation of efferocytosis, our study proposes a potential link between βII-spectrin deregulation and male infertility.

Abstract: Over the last years, there is accumulating evidence that acidic organelles can accumulate and release Ca2+ upon cell activation. Hence, reliable recording of Ca2+ dynamics in these compartments is essential for understanding the physiopathological aspects of acidic organelles. Genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) are valuable tools to monitor Ca2+ in specific locations, although their use in acidic compartments is challenging due to the pH sensitivity of most available fluorescent GECIs. By contrast, bioluminescent GECIs have a combination of features (marginal pH sensitivity, low background, no phototoxicity, no photobleaching, high dynamic range and tunable affinity) that render them advantageous to achieve an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio in acidic compartments. This article reviews the use of bioluminescent aequorin-based GECIs targeted to acidic compartments. A need for more measurements in highly acidic compartments is identified.

Abstract: Deregulation of lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a vital determinant for the onset and progression of malignancies, yet the relationship between LMTK2 and glioblastoma (GBM) is undetermined. This study was carried out to determine the relevance of LMTK2 in GBM. Initiating investigation by assessing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data showed LMTK2 mRNA levels were decreased in GBM tissue. Later examination of clinical specimens confirmed low levels of LMTK2 mRNA and protein in GBM tissue. The downregulated level of LMTK2 in patients with GBM was related to poor overall survival. A suppressive function of LMTK2 on the proliferative capability and metastatic potential of GBM cells was demonstrated by overexpressing LMTK2 in GBM cell lines. Moreover, the restoration of LMTK2 augmented the sensitivity of GBM cells to the chemotherapy drug temozolomide. The mechanistic investigation uncovered LMTK2 as a regulator of the runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3)/Notch signaling pathway. The overexpression of LMTK2 increased the expression of RUNX3 while inhibiting the activation of Notch signaling. The silencing of RUNX3 diminished the regulatory role of LMTK2 on Notch signaling. The inhibition of Notch signaling reversed the LMTK2-silencing-elicited protumor effects. Importantly, LMTK2-overexpressed GBM cells displayed weakened tumorigenicity in xenograft models. Our findings illustrate that LMTK2 has a tumor-inhibition function in GBM by constraining Notch signaling via RUNX3. This work indicates the deregulation of the LMTK2-mediated RUNX3/Notch signaling pathway may be a novel molecular mechanism for the malignant transformation of GBMs. This work highlights the interest in LMTK2-related approaches for treating GBM.

Abstract: Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway includes canonical and non-canonical activation manners. In colorectal cancer, we have previously shown that PGE2-JNK could initiate non-canonical activation of the Hh signaling pathway. In this study, we showed that c-Jun, a classic substrate of JNK, increased Gli2 protein stability after phosphorylated by PGE2. Suppressing the function of c-Jun or JNK indicated that c-Jun prevents Gli2 from protease degradation caused by PGE2-JNK. Moreoer, we revealed that less ubiquitination of Gli2 was detected in colorectal cancer cells treated with PGE2 while suppression of c-Jun restored the ubiquitination of Gli2. In addition, we observed that suppression of c-Jun significantly decreased Gli2 expression no matter when Gli2 remained in phosphorylation or non-phosphorylation state. These phenomena were recapitulated, when the endpoint of Gli2 expression was replaced by Gli2 ubiquitination. Furthermore, we demonstrated that restricting c-Jun function ablated the PGE2-provoked Hh activity and proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. These results elucidated that the evasion of Gli2 with phosphorylation from proteasomal-ubiquitin degradation needed the cooperation of phosphorylated c-Jun by kinase JNK, which contributed to promoting Hh activation and the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. This study provides a theoretical foundation to target PGE2 downstream for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Periodontitis is a chronic osteolytic inflammatory disease resulting from complex dynamic interactions among bacterial pathogens and the host immune response. Macrophages play a vital role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis by triggering periodontal inflammation and inducing periodontium destruction. N-Acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) is an acetyltransferase that has been shown to catalyse N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) mRNA modification and is related to cellular pathophysiological processes, including the inflammatory immune response. Nevertheless, whether NAT10 regulates the inflammatory response of macrophages in periodontitis remains unclear. In this study, the expression of NAT10 in macrophages was found to decrease during LPS-induced inflammation. NAT10 knockdown significantly reduced the generation of inflammatory factors, while NAT10 overexpression had the opposite effect. RNA sequencing revealed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in the NF-κB signalling pathway and oxidative stress. Both the NF-κB inhibitor Bay11-7082 and the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could reverse the upregulation of inflammatory factors. NAC inhibited the phosphorylation of NF-κB, but Bay11-7082 had no effect on the production of ROS in NAT10-overexpressing cells, suggesting that NAT10 activated the LPS-induced NF-κB signalling pathway by regulating ROS generation. Furthermore, the expression and stability of Nox2 was promoted after NAT10 overexpression, indicating that Nox2 may be a potential target of NAT10. In vivo, the NAT10 inhibitor Remodelin reduced macrophage infiltration and bone resorption in ligature-induced periodontitis mice. In summary, these results showed that NAT10 accelerated LPS-induced inflammation via the NOX2-ROS-NF-κB pathway in macrophages and that its inhibitor Remodelin might be of potential therapeutic significance in periodontitis treatment.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and low tricarboxylic acid (TCA) activity in the brain promote pupal diapause, which is characterized by metabolic depression and lifespan extension. However, it is unclear whether ROS are associated with TCA activity. In this study, we demonstrate that ROS downregulate TCA activity and acetyl-CoA and pyruvate levels in the brains of diapause-destined pupae in the moth Helicoverpa armigera, as well as the protein levels of acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and pyruvate kinase (PK), two proteins involved in the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA and pyruvate, respectively. Interestingly, miR-34, which is highly expressed in the brains of diapause-destined pupae, can respond to ROS signaling. Furthermore, we show that miR-34 can reduce the expression of ACS and PK by directly targeting their mRNAs. Additionally, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a transcription factor, can be activated by ROS and then promotes miR-34 transcription by binding a cis-element in its promoter. Moreover, we observed delayed pupal development after treatment with a ROS activator paraquat and a HIF activator dimethyloxallyl glycine. Taken together, these results suggest that a novel pathway ROS/HIF/miR-34/ACS-PK was found to negatively regulate TCA activity to promote insect diapause for lifespan extension.

Abstract: Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) that are enriched in adipose tissue with multilineage differentiation potential have become an important tool in therapeutic research and tissue engineering. Certain breeds of sheep exhibit a unique fat tail trait such that tail tissue accounts for approximately 10 % of body weight and can provide an excellent source of ADSCs. Here, we describe isolation of primary ADSCs from ovine embryonic fat tail tissues that displayed high self-renewal capacity, multilineage differentiation and excellent adipogenic ability. Through transcriptome analysis covering ADSCs differentiating into adipocytes, 37 transcription factors were involved in early transcriptional events that initiate a regulatory cascade of adipogenesis; the entire adipogenic activity consists of a reduction in proliferation ability and upregulation of genes related to lipid generation and energy metabolism, as well as several genes associated with myogenesis. Furthermore, Comparative transcriptome analysis across species (sheep, human, and mouse) revealed enhanced basal metabolic ability in differentiating ovine ADSCs, which may relate to the excellent adipogenic capability of these cells. We also identified a small evolutionarily conserved gene set, consisting of 21 and 22 genes exhibiting increased and decreased expression, respectively. Almost half (20) of these genes have not previously been reported to regulate adipogenesis in mammals. In this study, we identified important regulators that trigger ovine adipocyte differentiation, main biological pathways involved in adipogenesis as well as the evolutionarily conserved genes governing adipogenic process across species. Our study provides a novel excellent biomaterial and novel genes regulating adipogenesis for cellular transplantation therapy and investigations of fat metabolism.

Abstract: Within the various subtypes of ALL, patients with a BCR-ABL-positive background as well as with a genetic change in the KMT2A gene have by far the worst survival probabilities. Interestingly, both subtypes are characterized by highly activated tyrosine kinases. SHIP1 serves as an important negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is often constitutively activated in ALL. The protein expression of SHIP1 is decreased in most T-ALL and in some subgroups of B-ALL. In this study, we analyzed the expression of SHIP1 protein in detail in the context of groups with aberrant activated tyrosine kinases, namely BCR-ABL (Ph+) and Flt3 (KMT2A translocations). We demonstrate that constitutively activated Src kinases downstream of BCR-ABL and receptor tyrosine kinases reduce the SHIP1 expression in a SHIP1-Y1021 phosphorylated-dependent manner with subsequent ubiquitin marked proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of BCR-ABL (Imatinib), Flt3 (Quizartinib) or Src-Kinase-Family (Saracatinib) leads to significant reconstitution of SHIP1 protein expression. These results further support a functional role of SHIP1 as tumor suppressor protein and could be the basis for the establishment of a targeted therapy form.

Abstract: Adverse effects of spaceflight on the human body are attritubuted to microgravity and space radiation. One of the most sensitive organs affected by them is the eye, particularly the retina. The conditions that astronauts suffer, such as visual acuity, is collectively called a spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS); however, the underlying molecular mechanism of the microgravity-induced ocular pathogenesis is not clearly understood. The current study explored how microgravity affects the retina function in ARPE19 cells in vitro under time-averaged simulated microgravity (μG) generated by clinostat. We found multicellular spheroid (MCS) formation and a significantly decreased cell migration potency under μG conditions compared to 1G in ARPE19 cells. We also observed that μG increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causes mitochondrial dysfunction in ARPE19 cells. Subsequently, we showed that μG activates autophagic pathways and ciliogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mitophagy activation is triggered via the mTOR-ULK1-BNIP3 signaling axis. Finally, we validated the effectiveness of TPP-Niacin in mitigating μG-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro, which provides the first experimental evidence for TPP-Niacin as a potential therapeutic agent to ameliorate the cellular phenotypes caused by μG in ARPE19 cells. Further investigations are, however, required to determine its physiological functions and biological efficacies in primary human retinal cells, in vivo models, and target identification.

Abstract: During heat stress (HS), the intestinal epithelium suffers damage due to imbalance of tissue homeostasis. However, the specific mechanism by which intestinal stem cells (ISCs) migrate and differentiate along the crypt–villus axis to heal lesions upon insult is unclear. In our study, C57BL/6 mice and IPEC-J2 cells were subjected to normal ambient conditions (25 °C for 7 days in vivo and 37 °C for 18 h in vitro) or 41 °C. The results showed that HS impaired intestinal morphology and barrier function. The numbers of ISCs (SOX9+ cells), mitotic cells (PCNA+ cells), and differentiated cells (Paneth cells marked by lysozyme, absorptive cells marked by Villin, goblet cells marked by Mucin2, enteroendocrine cells marked by Chromogranin A, and tuft cells marked by DCAMKL1) were reduced under high temperature. Importantly, BrdU incorporation confirmed the decreased migration ability of jejunal epithelial cells exposed to 41 °C. Furthermore, intestinal organoids (IOs) expanded from jejunal crypt cells in the HS group exhibited greater growth disadvantages. Mechanistically, the occurrence of these phenotypes was accompanied by FAK/paxillin/F-actin signaling disruption in the jejunum. The fact that the FAK agonist ZINC40099027 reversed the HS-triggered inhibition of IPEC-J2 cell differentiation and migration further confirmed the dominant role of FAK in response to high-temperature conditions. Overall, the present investigation is the first to reveal a major role of FAK/paxillin/F-actin signaling in HS-induced ISC migration and differentiation along the crypt–villus axis, which indicates a new therapeutic target for intestinal epithelial regeneration after heat injuries.

Abstract: Distorted neuronal calcium signaling has been reported in many neurodegenerative disorders, including different types of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are primarily affected in SCAs and the disturbances in the calcium homeostasis were observed in SCA PCs. Our previous results have revealed that 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) induced greater calcium responses in SCA2-58Q PC cultures than in wild type (WT) PC cultures. Here we observed that glutamate-induced calcium release in PCs cells bodies is significantly higher in SCA2-58Q PCs from acute cerebellar slices compared to WT PCs of the same age. Recent studies have demonstrated that the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) plays an important role in the regulation of the neuronal calcium signaling in cerebellar PCs in mice. The main function of STIM1 is to regulate store-operated calcium entry through the TRPC/Orai channels formation to refill the calcium stores in the ER when it is empty. Here we demonstrated that the chronic viral-mediated expression of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting STIM1 specifically in cerebellar PCs alleviates the deranged calcium signaling in SCA2-58Q PCs, rescues the spine loss in these cerebellar neurons, and also improves the motor decline in SCA2-58Q mice. Thus, our preliminary results support the important role of the altered neuronal calcium signaling in SCA2 pathology and also suggest the STIM1-mediated signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of SCA2 patients.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) continues to be one of the most common cancers in men worldwide. The six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) protein is overexpressed in several types of human tumors, particularly in PCa. Our research group has demonstrated that STEAP1 overexpression is associated with PCa progression and aggressiveness. Therefore, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by STEAP1 overexpression will provide important insights to delineate new strategies for PCa treatment. In the present work, a proteomic strategy was used to characterize the intracellular signaling pathways and the molecular targets downstream of STEAP1 in PCa cells. A label-free approach was applied using an Orbitrap LC-MS/MS system to characterize the proteome of STEAP1-knockdown PCa cells. More than 6700 proteins were identified, of which a total of 526 proteins were found differentially expressed in scramble siRNA versus STEAP1 siRNA (234 proteins up-regulated and 292 proteins down-regulated). Bioinformatics analysis allowed us to explore the mechanism through which STEAP1 exerts influence on PCa, revealing that endocytosis, RNA transport, apoptosis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and metabolic pathways are the main biological processes where STEAP1 is involved. By immunoblotting, it was confirmed that STEAP1 silencing induced the up-regulation of cathepsin B, intersectin-1, and syntaxin 4, and the down-regulation of HRas, PIK3C2A, and DIS3. These findings suggested that blocking STEAP1 might be a suitable strategy to activate apoptosis and endocytosis, and diminish cellular metabolism and intercellular communication, leading to inhibition of PCa progression.

Abstract: The mechanism behind peroxisomal membrane protein targeting is still poorly understood, with only two yeast proteins believed to be involved and no consensus targeting sequence. Pex19 is thought to bind peroxisomal membrane proteins in the cytosol, and is subsequently recruited by Pex3 at the peroxisomal surface, followed by protein insertion via a mechanism that is as-yet-unknown. However, some peroxisomal membrane proteins still correctly sort in the absence of Pex3 or Pex19, suggesting that multiple sorting pathways exist. Here, we studied sorting of yeast peroxisomal ABC transporter Pxa1. Co-localisation analysis of Pxa1-GFP in a collection of 86 peroxisome-related deletion strains revealed that Pxa1 sorting requires Pex3 and Pex19, while none of the other 84 proteins tested were essential. To identify regions with peroxisomal targeting information in Pxa1, we developed a novel in vivo re-targeting assay, using a reporter consisting of the mitochondrial ABC transporter Mdl1 lacking its N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal. Using this assay, we showed that the N-terminal 95 residues of Pxa1 are sufficient for retargeting this reporter to peroxisomes. Interestingly, truncated Pxa1 lacking residues 1–95 still localised to peroxisomes. This was confirmed via localisation of various Pxa1 truncation and deletion constructs. However, localisation of Pxa1 lacking residues 1–95 depended on the presence of its interaction partner Pxa2, indicating that this truncated protein does not contain a true targeting signal.

Abstract: Podocytopathy and associated nephrotic syndrome have been reported in a mouse strain (Asah1fl/fl/Podocre) with a podocyte-specific deletion of α subunit (the main catalytic subunit) of acid ceramidase (Ac). However, the pathogenesis of podocytopathy in these mice remains unclear. The present study tested whether Ac deficiency impairs autophagic flux in podocytes through blockade of transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) channel as a potential pathogenic mechanism of podocytopathy in Asah1fl/fl/Podocre mice. We first demonstrated that impairment of autophagic flux occurred in podocytes lacking Asah1 gene, which was evidenced by autophagosome accumulation and reduced lysosome-autophagosome interaction. TRPML1 channel agonists recovered lysosome-autophagosome interaction and attenuated autophagosome accumulation in podocytes from Asah1fl/fl/Podocre mice, while TRPML1 channel inhibitors impaired autophagic flux in WT/WT podocytes and worsened autophagic deficiency in podocytes lacking Asah1 gene. The effects of TRPML1 channel agonist were blocked by dynein inhibitors, indicating a critical role of dynein activity in the control of lysosome movement due to TRPML1 channel-mediated Ca2+ release. It was also found that there is an enhanced phenotypic transition to dedifferentiation status in podocytes lacking Asah1 gene in vitro and in vivo. Such podocyte phenotypic transition was inhibited by TRPML1 channel agonists but enhanced by TRPML1 channel inhibitors. Moreover, we found that TRPML1 gene silencing induced autophagosome accumulation and dedifferentiation in podocytes. Based on these results, we conclude that Ac activity is essential for autophagic flux and maintenance of differentiated status of podocytes. Dysfunction or deficiency of Ac may impair autophagic flux and induce podocyte dedifferentiation, which may be an important pathogenic mechanism of podocytopathy and associated nephrotic syndrome.

Abstract: Aberrant expression of multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins is one of the features of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that make them escape chemotherapy. A well-orchestrated regulation of multiple MDRs by different transcription factors in cancer cells confers this drug resistance. An in silico analysis of the major MDR genes revealed a possible regulation by RFX1 and Nrf2. Previous reports also noted that Nrf2 is a positive regulator of MDR genes in NT2 cells. But we, for the first time, report that Regulatory factor X1 (RFX1), a pleiotropic transcription factor, negatively regulates the major MDR genes, Abcg2, Abcb1, Abcc1, and Abcc2, in NT2 cells. The levels of RFX1 in undifferentiated NT2 cells were found to be very low, which significantly increased upon RA-induced differentiation. Ectopic expression of RFX1 reduced the levels of transcripts corresponding to MDRs and stemness-associated genes. Interestingly, Bexarotene, an RXR agonist that acts as an inhibitor of Nrf2-ARE signaling, could increase the transcription of RFX1. Further analysis revealed that the RFX1 promoter has binding sites for RXRα, and upon Bexarotene exposure RXRα could bind and activate the RFX1 promoter. Bexarotene, alone or in combination with Cisplatin, could inhibit many cancer/CSC-associated properties in NT2 cells. Also, it significantly reduced the expression of drug resistance proteins and made the cells sensitive towards Cisplatin. Our study proves that RFX1 could be a potent molecule to target MDRs, and Bexarotene can induce RXRα-mediated RFX1 expression, therefore, would be a better chemo-assisting drug during therapy.

Abstract: Aquatic single-cell organisms have long been believed to be unique primary producers of omega-3 long-chain (≥C20) polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω3 LC-PUFA). Multiple invertebrates including annelids have been discovered to possess methyl-end desaturases enabling key steps in the de novo synthesis of ω3 LC-PUFA, and thus potentially contributing to their production in the ocean. Along methyl-end desaturases, the repertoire and function of further LC-PUFA biosynthesising enzymes is largely missing in Annelida. In this study we examined the front-end desaturase gene repertoire across the phylum Annelida, from Polychaeta and Clitellata, major classes of annelids comprising most annelid diversity. We further characterised the functions of the encoded enzymes in selected representative species by using a heterologous expression system based in yeast, demonstrating that functions of Annelida front-end desaturases have highly diversified during their expansion in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We concluded that annelids possess at least two front-end desaturases with Δ5 and Δ6Δ8 desaturase regioselectivities, enabling all the desaturation reactions required to convert the C18 precursors into the physiologically relevant LC-PUFA such as eicosapentaenoic and arachidonic acids, but not docosahexaenoic acid. Such a gene complement is conserved across the different taxonomic groups within Annelida.

Abstract: The voltage-gated hydrogen channel Hv1 encoded in humans by the HVCN1 gene is a highly selective proton channel that allows large fluxes of protons across biological membranes. Hv1 form functional dimers of four transmembrane spanning proteins resembling the voltage sensing domain of potassium channels. Each subunit is highly selective for protons and is controlled by changes in the transmembrane voltage and pH gradient. Hv1 is most expressed in phagocytic cells where it sustains NADPH oxidase-dependent bactericidal function and was reported to facilitate antibody production by B cells and to promote the maturation and motility of spermatocytes. Hv1 contributes to neuroinflammation following brain damage and favors cancer progression possibly by extruding protons generated during aerobic glycolysis of cancer cells. Lack of specific Hv1 inhibitors has hampered translation of this knowledge to treat immune, fertility, or malignancy diseases. In this study, we show that the genetic deletion of Hv1 delays tumor development in a mouse model of granulocytic sarcoma and report the discovery and characterization of two novel bioavailable inhibitors of Hv1 channels that we validate by orthogonal assays and electrophysiological recordings.

Abstract: Aging involves the time-dependent deterioration of physiological functions attributed to various intracellular and extracellular factors. Cellular senescence is akin to aging and involves alteration in redox homeostasis. This is primarily marked by increased reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), inflammatory gene expression, and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, all hallmarks of aging. It is proposed that gasotransmitters which include hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitric oxide (NO), may affect redox homeostasis during senescence. H2S has been independently shown to induce DNA damage and suppress oxidative stress. While an increase in NO levels during aging is well established, the role of H2S has remained controversial. To understand the role of H2S during aging, we evaluated H2S homeostasis in non-senescent and senescent cells, using a combination of direct measurements with a fluorescent reporter dye (WSP-5) and protein sulfhydration analysis. The free intracellular H2S and total protein sulfhydration levels are high during senescence, concomitant to cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) expression induction. Using lentiviral shRNA-mediated expression knockdown, we identified that H2S contributed by CSE alters global gene expression, which regulates key inflammatory processes during cellular senescence. We propose that H2S decreases inflammation during cellular senescence by reducing phosphorylation of IκBα and the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). H2S was also found to reduce NO levels, a significant source of nitrosative stress during cellular senescence. Overall, we establish H2S as a key gasotransmitter molecule that regulates inflammatory phenotype and nitrosative stress during cellular senescence.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neuromuscular disease. Recently, several gain-of-function mutations in SPTLC1 were associated with juvenile ALS. SPTLC1 encodes for a subunit of the serine-palmitoyltransferase (SPT) - the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo synthesis of sphingolipids (SL). SPT activity, and thus SL de novo synthesis, is tightly controlled by a homeostatic feedback mechanism mediated by ORMDL proteins. Here we report a novel SPTLC1p.L38R mutation in a young Chinese girl with a signature of juvenile ALS. The patient presented with muscular weakness and atrophy, tongue tremor and fasciculation, breathing problems and positive pyramidal signs. All SPTLC1-ALS mutations including the SPTLC1 p.L38R are located within a single membrane-spanning domain of the protein and impede the interaction with the regulatory ORMDL subunit of SPT. Pertinent to the altered homeostatic control, lipid analysis showed overall increased SL levels in the patient plasma. An increased SPT activity and SL de novo synthesis was confirmed in p.L38R expressing HEK293 cells. Particularily dihydro-sphingolipids (dhSL) were signficantly increased in patient plasma and p.L38R mutant expressing cells. Increased dhSL formation has been previously linked to neurotoxicity and may be involved in the pathomechanism of SPTLC1-ALS mutations.

Abstract: Calcium is a major regulator of cellular metabolism. Calcium controls mitochondrial respiration, and calcium signaling is used to meet cellular energetic demands through energy production in the organelle. Although it has been widely assumed that Ca2+-actions require its uptake by mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), alternative pathways modulated by cytosolic Ca2+ have been recently proposed. Recent findings have indicated a role for cytosolic Ca2+ signals acting on mitochondrial NADH shuttles in the control of cellular metabolism in neurons using glucose as fuel. It has been demonstrated that AGC1/Aralar, the component of the malate/aspartate shuttle (MAS) regulated by cytosolic Ca2+, participates in the maintenance of basal respiration exerted through Ca2+-fluxes between ER and mitochondria, whereas mitochondrial Ca2+-uptake by MCU does not contribute. Aralar/MAS pathway, activated by small cytosolic Ca2+ signals, provides in fact substrates, redox equivalents and pyruvate, fueling respiration. Upon activation and increases in workload, neurons upregulate OxPhos, cytosolic pyruvate production and glycolysis, together with glucose uptake, in a Ca2+-dependent way, and part of this upregulation is via Ca2+ signaling. Both MCU and Aralar/MAS contribute to OxPhos upregulation, Aralar/MAS playing a major role, especially at small and submaximal workloads. Ca2+ activation of Aralar/MAS, by increasing cytosolic NAD+/NADH provides Ca2+-dependent increases in glycolysis and cytosolic pyruvate production priming respiration as a feed-forward mechanism in response to workload. Thus, except for glucose uptake, these processes are dependent on Aralar/MAS, whereas MCU is the relevant target for Ca2+ signaling when MAS is bypassed, by using pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate as substrates.

Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a process in which a photosensitizer (PS) is exposed to specific wavelengths and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which act within nanometers. The low invasive nature and directed cytotoxicity of this approach render it attractive to the treatment of different conditions, including the ones that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The effect of PDT on healthy neurons is one main concern over its use in the CNS, since neuronal-like cells were shown to be particularly sensitive to certain PSs. Among available PSs, 1,9-dimethyl-methylene blue (DMMB) stands out as being resistant to reduction to its inactive leuco form and by being able to produce high levels of singlet‑oxygen. In this study, we aimed to investigate DMMB photodamage mechanisms in the hippocampal cell line HT22. Our results demonstrate that DMMB-PDT decrease in cell viability was linked with an increase in cell death and overall ROS production. Besides, it resulted in a significant increase in mitochondrial ROS production and decreased mitochondria membrane potential. Furthermore, DMMB-PDT significantly increased the presence of acidic autolysosomes, which was accompanied by an increase in ATG1 and ATG8 homologue GaBarap1 expression, and decreased DRAM1 expression. Taken together our results indicated that mitochondrial and autophagic dysfunction underlie DMMB-PDT cytotoxicity in neuronal cells.

Abstract: Diapause in insects is akin to dauer in Caenorhabditis elegans and hibernation in vertebrates, characterized by metabolic depression and lifespan extension. Previous studies have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in brains of diapause-destined pupae are more abundant than those in nondiapause-destined pupae in Helicoverpa armigera, but the ROS regulating HIF-1α activity remain unknown. Here, we showed that high ROS levels in brains of diapause-destined pupae resulted in low casein kinase 2 (CK2) activity and that downregulation of CK2 caused low expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3), which is an inhibitor of p-p38. Thus, high p-p38 levels accumulate to improve HIF-1α activity via activating HIF-1α phosphorylation at the S732 residue to regulate insect diapause. This is the first report showing that a new pathway, ROS-CK2-MKP3-p38, regulates HIF-1α activity for lifespan in insects.

Abstract: Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are amongst the highest priority drug-resistant pathogens, for which new antibiotics are urgently needed. Whilst antibiotic drug development is inherently challenging, this is particularly true for Gram-negative bacteria due to the presence of the outer membrane, a highly selective permeability barrier that prevents the ingress of several classes of antibiotic. This selectivity is largely due to an outer leaflet composed of the glycolipid lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is essential for the viability of almost all Gram-negative bacteria. This essentiality, coupled with the conservation of the synthetic pathway across species and recent breakthroughs in our understanding of transport and membrane homeostasis has made LPS an attractive target for novel antibiotic drug development. Several different targets have been explored and small molecules developed that show promising activity in vitro. However, these endeavours have met limited success in clinical testing and the polymyxins, discovered more than 70 years ago, remain the only LPS-targeting drugs to enter the clinic thus far. In this review, we will discuss efforts to develop therapeutic inhibitors of LPS synthesis and transport and the reasons for limited success, and explore new developments in understanding polymyxin mode of action and the identification of new analogues with reduced toxicity and enhanced activity.

Abstract: Fungal pathogens have been under the spotlight as their expanding geographic range combined with their potential harm to vulnerable populations turns them into increasingly threats to public health. Therefore, it is ultimately important to unveil the mechanisms associated with their infection process for further new treatment discovery. With this purpose, sphingolipid-based research has gained attention over the last years as these molecules have key properties that can regulate fungal pathogenicity. Here we discuss some of these properties as well as their role in fungal diseases, focusing on the subgroup of glycosphingolipids, as they represent promising molecules for drug discovery and for the development of fungal vaccines.

Abstract: Mitochondrial protein homeostasis is fine-tuned by diverse physiological processes such as mitochondria-associated degradation (MAD), which is regulated by valosin-containing protein (VCP) and its cofactors. As a cofactor of VCP, the mutation of phospholipase A-2-activating protein (PLAA) is the genetic cause of PLAA-associated neurodevelopmental disorder (PLAAND). However, the physiological and pathological roles of PLAA in mitochondria remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PLAA partially associates with mitochondria. Deficiency in PLAA increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibits mitochondrial respiratory activity and causes excessive mitophagy. Mechanically, PLAA interacts with myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) and facilitates its retro-translocation and proteasome-dependent degradation. The upregulation of MCL1 promotes the oligomerization of NLR family member X1 (NLRX1) and activation of mitophagy. Whereas downregulating NLRX1 abolishes MCL1 induced mitophagy. In summary, our data identify PLAA as a novel mediator of mitophagy by regulating MCL1-NLRX1 axis. We propose mitophagy as a target for therapeutic intervention in PLAAND.

Abstract: Background
The large extracellular matrix protein SVEP1 mediates cell adhesion via integrin α9β1. Recent studies have identified an association between a missense variant in SVEP1 and increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in humans and in mice Svep1 deficiency alters the development of atherosclerotic plaques. However how SVEP1 functionally contributes to CAD pathogenesis is not fully understood. Monocyte recruitment and differentiation to macrophages is a key step in the development of atherosclerosis. Here, we investigated the requirement for SVEP1 in this process.
Methods
SVEP1 expression was measured during monocyte–macrophage differentiation in primary monocytes and THP-1 human monocytic cells. SVEP1 knockout THP-1 cell lines and the dual integrin α4β1/α9β1 inhibitor, BOP, were utilised to investigate the effect of these proteins in THP-1 cell adhesion, migration and cell spreading assays. Subsequent activation of downstream integrin signalling intermediaries was quantified by western blotting.
Results
SVEP1 gene expression increases in monocyte to macrophage differentiation in human primary monocytes and THP-1 cells. Using two SVEP1 knockout THP-1 cells we observed reduction in monocyte adhesion, migration, and cell spreading compared to control cells. Similar results were found with integrin α4β1/α9β1 inhibition. We demonstrate reduced activity of Rho and Rac1 in SVEP1 knockout THP-1 cells.
Conclusions
SVEP1 regulates monocyte recruitment and differentiation phenotypes through an integrin α4β1/α9β1 dependent mechanism.
General significance
These results describe a novel role for SVEP1 in monocyte behaviour relevant to CAD pathophysiology.

Abstract: Septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) was an important pathological component of severe sepsis and septic shock. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification was a common RNA modification in both mRNA and non-coding RNAs and was proved to be involved in sepsis and immune disorders. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the role and mechanism of METTL3 in lipopolysaccharide-induced myocardial injury. We firstly analyzed the expression changes of various m6A-related regulators in human samples in the GSE79962 data and the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of significantly changed m6A enzymes, showing that METTL3 had a high diagnostic ability in patients with SCM. Western blotting confirmed the high expression of METTL3 in LPS-treated H9C2 cells, which was consistent with the above results in human samples. In vitro and in vivo, the deficiency of METTL3 could improve the cardiac function, cardiac tissue damage, myocardial cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species levels in LPS-treated H9C2 cells and LPS-induced sepsis rats, respectively. In addition, we obtained 213 differential genes through transcriptome RNA-seq analysis, and conducted GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis through DAVID. We also found that the half-life of Myh3 mRNA was significantly reduced after METTL3 deletion and that Myh3 carried several potential m6A modification sites. In conclusion, we found that downregulation of METTL3 reversed LPS-induced myocardial cell and tissue damage and reduced cardiac function, mainly by increasing Myh3 stability. Our study revealed a key role of METTL3-mediated m6A methylation in septic cardiomyopathy, which may offer a potential mechanism for the therapy of septic cardiomyopathy.

Abstract: Studies suggested that the pathogenesis of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is related to inflammatory manifestations accompanied by specific cellular and molecular mechanisms in the IBC tumor microenvironment (TME). IBC is characterized by significantly higher infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that contribute to its metastatic process via secreting many cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 that enhance invasion and angiogenesis. Thus, there is a need to first understand how IBC-TME modulates the polarization of TAMs to better understand the role of TAMs in IBC. Herein, we used gene expression signature and Synchrotron Fourier-Transform Infrared Microspectroscopy (SR-μFTIR) to study the molecular and biochemical changes, respectively of in vitro polarized TAMs stimulated by the secretome of IBC and non-IBC cells. The gene expression signature showed significant differences in the macrophage's polarization-related genes between stimulated TAMs. FTIR spectra showed absorption bands in the region of 1700–1500 cm−1 attributed to the amide I ν(C=O), & νAS (CN), δ (NH), and amide II ν(CN), δ (NH) proteins bands. Moreover, three peaks of different intensities and areas were detected in the lipid region of the νCH2 and νCH3 stretching modes positioned within the 3000–2800 cm−1 range. The PCA analysis for the second derivative spectra of the amide regions discriminates between stimulated IBC and non-IBC TAMs. This study showed that IBC and non-IBC TMEs differentially modulate the polarization of TAMs and SR-μFTIR can determine these biochemical changes which will help to better understand the potential role of TAMs in IBC.

Preferential lipolysis of DGAT1 over DGAT2 generated triacylglycerol in Huh7 hepatocytes,

Abstract: Two distinct diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT1 and DGAT2) catalyze the final committed step of triacylglycerol (TG) synthesis in hepatocytes. After its synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) TG is either stored in cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) or is assembled into very low-density lipoproteins in the ER lumen. TG stored in cytosolic LDs is hydrolyzed by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and the released fatty acids are converted to energy by oxidation in mitochondria. We hypothesized that targeting/association of ATGL to LDs would differ depending on whether the TG stores were generated through DGAT1 or DGAT2 activities. Individual inhibition of DGAT1 or DGAT2 in Huh7 hepatocytes incubated with oleic acid did not yield differences in TG accretion while combined inhibition of both DGATs completely prevented TG synthesis suggesting that either DGAT can efficiently esterify exogenously supplied fatty acid. DGAT2-made TG was stored in larger LDs, whereas TG formed by DGAT1 accumulated in smaller LDs. Inactivation of DGAT1 or DGAT2 did not alter expression (mRNA or protein) of ATGL, the ATGL activator ABHD5/CGI-58, or LD coat proteins PLIN2 or PLIN5, but inactivation of both DGATs increased PLIN2 abundance despite a dramatic reduction in the number of LDs. ATGL was found to preferentially target to LDs generated by DGAT1 and fatty acids released from TG in these LDs were also preferentially used for fatty acid oxidation. Combined inhibition of DGAT2 and ATGL resulted in larger LDs, suggesting that the smaller size of DGAT1-generated LDs is the result of increased lipolysis of TG in these LDs.

Abstract: 5,7-Dihydroxy-4-methylcoumarin (D4M) is attributed to free radical scavenging effects, with wide application for anti-oxidation. This work aimed to assess D4M's impact on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. The cell viability was estimated with CCK-8 assay. Apoptosis was detected by the Annexin V-FITC and PI assay. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was determined by MitoSOX-Red and CellROX-Green probes. Mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed with TMRM staining. Immunofluorescence was utilized for hair cells and spiral ganglion neuron detection. Apoptosis-associated proteins were assessed by cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL staining. These results showed that D4M pretreatment protected hair cells from cisplatin-induced damage, increased cell viability, and decreased apoptosis in House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti1 (HEI-OC1) cells and neonatal mouse cochlear explants. D4M significantly inhibited cisplatin-induced mitochondrial apoptosis and reduced ROS accumulation. In addition, the protective effect of D4M on cisplatin-induced ototoxicity was also confirmed in cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons in neonatal mice. Mechanistic studies showed that D4M markedly downregulated p-JNK and elevated the expression ratio of p-FoxO1/FoxO1, thereby reducing cisplatin-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. Meanwhile, D4M-related protection of HEI-OC1 cells was significantly blunted by JNK signaling induction with anisomycin. This study supports the possibility that D4M may be used as a new compound to prevent cisplatin-related hearing loss.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is associated with protein misfolding, plaque accumulation, neuronal dysfunction, synaptic loss, and cognitive decline. The pathological cascade of AD includes the intracellular Tau hyperphosphorylation and its subsequent aggregation, extracellular Amyloid-β plaque formation and microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. The extracellular release of aggregated Tau is sensed by surveilling microglia through the involvement of various cell surface receptors. Among all, purinergic P2Y12R signaling is involved in microglial chemotaxis towards the damaged neurons. Microglial migration is highly linked with membrane-associated actin remodeling leading to the phagocytosis of extracellular Tau species. Here, we studied the formation of various actin structures such as podosome, lamellipodia and filopodia, in response to extracellular Tau monomers and aggregates. Microglial podosomes are colocalized with actin nucleator protein WASP, Arp2 and TKS5 adaptor protein during Tau-mediated migration. Moreover, the P2Y12 receptors were associated with F-actin-rich podosome structures, which signify the potential of Tau aggregates in microglial chemotaxis through the involvement of actin remodeling.

Abstract: One of the key outcomes of activation of DNA replication checkpoint (DRC) or DNA damage checkpoint (DDC) is the increased synthesis of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), which is a prerequisite for normal progression through the S phase and for effective DNA repair. We have recently shown that DDC increases aerobic metabolism and activates the electron transport chain (ETC) to elevate ATP production and dNTP synthesis by repressing transcription of histone genes, leading to globally altered chromatin architecture and increased transcription of genes encoding enzymes of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the ETC. The aim of this study was to determine whether DRC activates ETC. We show here that DRC activates ETC by a checkpoint kinase Dun1p-dependent mechanism. DRC induces transcription of RNR1-4 genes and elevates mtDNA copy number. Inactivation of RRM3 or SGS1, two DNA helicases important for DNA replication, activates DRC but does not render cells dependent on ETC. However, fitness of rrm3Δ and sgs1Δ cells requires Dun1p. The slow growth of rrm3Δdun1Δ and sgs1Δdun1Δ cells can be suppressed by introducing sml1Δ mutation, indicating that the slow growth is due to low levels of dNTPs. Interestingly, inactivation of ETC in dun1Δ cells results in a synthetic growth defect that can be suppressed by sml1Δ mutation, suggesting that ETC is important for dNTP synthesis in the absence of Dun1p function. Together, our results reveal an unexpected connection between ETC, replication stress, and Dun1p kinase.

Abstract: Chemotherapeutic drugs are used routinely for treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients but are ineffective in a substantial proportion of patients. Abnormal hematopoietic microenvironments, in addition to spontaneous characteristics of malignant clones, contribute to ineffective hematopoiesis. In our study, we found expression of enzyme β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (β4GalT1), which regulates N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) modification of proteins, is elevated in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) of MDS patients, and also contributes to drug ineffectiveness through a protective effect on malignant cells. Our investigation of the underlying molecular mechanism revealed that β4GalT1-overexpressing BMSCs promoted MDS clone cells resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs and also showed enhanced secretion of cytokine CXCL1 through degradation of tumor protein p53. Chemotherapeutic drug tolerance of myeloid cells was inhibited by application of exogenous LacNAc disaccharide and blocking of CXCL1. Our findings clarify the functional role of β4GalT1-catalyzed LacNAc modification in BMSCs of MDS. Clinical alteration of this process is a potential new strategy that may substantially enhance effectiveness of therapies for MDS and other malignancies, by targeting a niche interaction.

Abstract: Dyslipidemia is often associated with unhealthy dietary habits, and many mammalian studies have explored the mode of action of certain bioactive compounds such as β-glucans and n-3 PUFAs to understand their potential to normalize the lipid metabolism. There are only a few investigations that adopted omic approaches to unveil their combined effect on hypercholesterolemia. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) was used as a model organism to reveal the efficacy of Schizochytrium oil and β-glucans (from Euglena gracilis and Phaeodactylum tricornutum) against cholesterol-rich diet induced dyslipidemia. One of the folowing four diets was fed to a particular group of fish: a control high-cholesterol diet, a Schizochytrium oil diet or one of the two diets containing the oil and β-glucan. The plasma HDL, expression of hepatic genes linked to, among others, ferric ion binding and plasma phosphatidylcholines were higher and plasma cholesterol esters and triacylglycerols were lower in the microbial oil-fed fish compared to the fish fed high cholesterol diet. While the fish fed a mix of microbial oil and Euglena β-glucan had lower plasma triacylglycerols and expression of hepatic genes linked to PPAR signaling pathway and enriched biosynthesis of plasma unsaturated fatty acids, the fish fed microbial oil-Phaeodactylum β-glucan combination had lower abundance of triacylglycerols rich in saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol esters in the plasma.

Abstract: Calcium (Ca2+)-ATPases are ATP-dependent enzymes that transport Ca2+ ions against their electrochemical gradient playing the fundamental biological function of keeping the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in the submicromolar range to prevent cytotoxic effects. In plants, type IIB autoinhibited Ca2+-ATPases (ACAs) are localised both at the plasma membrane and at the endomembranes including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and tonoplast and their activity is primarily regulated by Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. Instead, type IIA ER-type Ca2+-ATPases (ECAs) are present mainly at the ER and Golgi Apparatus membranes and are active at resting Ca2+. Whereas research in plants has historically focused on the biochemical characterization of these pumps, more recently the attention has been also addressed on the physiological roles played by the different isoforms. This review aims to highlight the main biochemical properties of both type IIB and type IIA Ca2+ pumps and their involvement in the shaping of cellular Ca2+ dynamics induced by different stimuli.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in cancer immunotherapy, their efficacy for treating patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) is low due to complex immune evasion mechanisms. However, the function of long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) in immune evasion has not been fully clarified. This study aimed to expound the role of myocardial infarction-associated transcript (MIAT), a lncRNA significantly upregulated in three PRAD-associated datasets, in immune evasion and try to reveal the potential mechanism. MIAT was highly expressed in PRAD tissues and predicted poor prognosis, and suppression of MIAT inhibited the malignant biological behavior of PRAD cells. Moreover, the depletion of MIAT promoted the immune response of CD8+ T cells and hampered the immune evasion of PRAD cells. In addition, MIAT downregulated TP53 protein expression by recruiting transducin beta-like protein 1X (TBL1X) for ubiquitination modification. Silencing of TP53 or overexpression of TBL1X was enough to abate the tumor suppressive effects of MIAT knockdown in vitro and in vivo. Our results provide evidence for a novel regulation mechanism of CD8+ T cells in PRAD and MIAT may serve as a potential therapeutic target in PRAD.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to explore the role of ferroptosis in the formation of calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stones and the regulatory mechanism of the ankyrin repeat domain 1 (ANKRD1) gene. The study found that the Nrf2/HO-1 and p53/SLC7A11 signaling pathways were activated in the kidney stone model group, and the expression of the ferroptosis marker proteins SLC7A11 and GPX4 was significantly reduced, while the expression of ACSL4 was significantly increased. The expression of the iron transport-related proteins CP and TF increased significantly, and Fe2+ accumulated in the cell. The expression of HMGB1 increased significantly. In addition, the level of intracellular oxidative stress was increased. The gene with the most significant difference caused by CaOx crystals in HK-2 cells was ANKRD1. Silencing or overexpression of ANKRD1 by lentiviral infection technology regulated the expression of the p53/SLC7A11 signaling pathway, which regulated the ferroptosis induced by CaOx crystals. In conclusion, CaOx crystals can mediate ferroptosis through the Nrf2/HO-1 and p53/SLC7A11 pathways, thereby weakening the resistance of HK-2 cells to oxidative stress and other unfavorable factors, enhancing cell damage, and increasing crystal adhesion and CaOx crystal deposition in the kidney. ANKRD1 participates in the formation and development of CaOx kidney stones by activating ferroptosis mediated by the p53/SLC7A11 pathway.

Abstract: 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl, commonly known as TEMPO, is one of the compounds called nitroxides that are used in the chemical industry for synthesis of many organic compounds as well as for electrodes in all-organic radical batteries. Additionally, TEMPO is a widely used antioxidant in scientific studies. Technological progress and simultaneous care for the environment leads to resorting to new industrial methods which require the use of compounds that have not been fully tested for their impact on living organisms. Therefore, TEMPO may be an environmental pollutant and its effect on living organisms is not fully understood. The aim of our study was to determine the influence of TEMPO on the physiology, chronological lifespan and wide transcription changes of a eukaryotic model organism, namely the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. For this purpose, we used the BY4741 wild-type and isogenic mutants with a disorder in the response to oxidative stress (sod1Δ, sod2Δ, yap1Δ) and repair of DNA damage (rad52Δ). We showed that supplementation with TEMPO inhibited the cell growth rate of all analyzed strains while simultaneously slowing down the aging of post-mitotic cells in the yeast population. In addition, TEMPO-treated yeast cells manifested a significantly increased level of metabolism in the wild-type and sod2Δ strains. TEMPO also displayed genoprotective effect by reducing the number of DNA double-strand breaks in cells. Here, we are the first to show the widespread effect of TEMPO on yeast. In conclusion, we have shown that, contrary to the commonly accepted notion, TEMPO has also a toxic effect, especially on active mitotic cells. We hypothesize that translation impairment or ribosome biogenesis disorder is likely to be considered secondary effects of TEMPO toxicity related to cell cycle arrest. Therefore, despite the growing interest in the use of this compound in the chemical industry, its toxic effect on the environment, especially biosphere, should be taken into account.

Abstract: The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a master regulator of the melanocyte cell lineage. Aberrant MITF activity can lead to multiple malignancies including skin cancer, where it modulates the progression and invasiveness of melanoma. MITF-regulated gene expression requires recruitment of the transcriptional co-regulator CBP/p300, but details of this process are not fully defined. In this study, we investigate the structural and functional interaction between the MITF N-terminal transactivation domain (MITFTAD) and CBP/p300. Using pulldown assays and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy we determined that MITFTAD is intrinsically disordered and binds to the TAZ1 and TAZ2 domains of CBP/p300 with moderate affinity. The solution-state structure of the MITFTAD:TAZ2 complex reveals that MITF interacts with a hydrophobic surface of TAZ2, while remaining somewhat dynamic. Peptide array and mutagenesis experiments determined that an acidic motif is integral to the MITFTAD:TAZ2 interaction and is necessary for transcriptional activity of MITF. Peptides that bind to the same surface of TAZ2 as MITFTAD, such as the adenoviral protein E1A, are capable of displacing MITF from TAZ2 and inhibiting transactivation. These findings provide insight into co-activator recruitment by MITF that are fundamental to our understanding of MITF targeted gene regulation and melanoma biology.

Abstract: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is thermogenic, expressing high levels of uncoupling protein-1 to convert nutrient energy to heat energy, bypassing ATP synthesis. BAT is a promising therapeutic target for treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes since it converts fatty acids into heat but mechanisms controlling brown adipogenesis remain unclear. Knockdown of acetyl-Coenzyme A acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) in C3H10T1/2 cells suppressed brown adipocyte maturation during the current study and ACAT1 overexpression promoted brown adipocyte maturation. The downstream target of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1-α (PGC1α), was involved in the action of ACAT1 on brown adipocyte maturation. ACAT1 overexpression enhanced AMPK phosphorylation and promoted PGC1α expression. It is suggested that ACAT1 promotes brown adipocyte maturation by activating the AMPK-PGC1α signaling pathway.

Abstract: Tracheal stenosis (TS) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease that can easily lead to respiratory failure and even death. Interleukin-11 (IL-11) has recently received increased attention as a fibrogenic factor, but its function in TS is uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the role of IL-11 in TS regulation based on clinical samples from patients with TS and a rat model of TS produced by nylon brush scraping. Using lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA (lentivirus-shRNA) targeting the IL-11 receptor (IL-11Rα), we lowered IL-11Rα levels in the rat trachea. Histological and immunostaining methods were used to evaluate the effects of IL-11Rα knockdown on tracheal injury, molecular phenotype, and fibrosis in TS rats. We show that IL-11 was significantly elevated in circulating serum and granulation tissue in patients with TS. In vitro, TGFβ1 dose-dependently stimulated IL-11 secretion from human tracheal epithelial cells (Beas-2b) and primary rat tracheal fibroblasts (PRTF). IL-11 transformed the epithelial cell phenotype to the mesenchymal cell phenotype by activating the β-catenin pathway. Furthermore, IL-11 activated the atypical ERK signaling pathway, stimulated fibroblasts proliferation, and transformed fibroblasts into alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) positive myofibroblasts. IL-11-neutralizing antibodies (IL-11NAb) or ERK inhibitors (U0126) inhibited IL-11 activity and downregulated fibrotic responses involving TGFβ/SMAD signaling. In vivo, IL-11Rα knockdown rats showed unobstructed tracheal lumen, relatively intact epithelial structure, and significantly reduced granulation tissue proliferation and collagen fiber deposition. Our findings confirm that IL-11 may be a target for future drug prevention and treatment of tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: Gram-negative bacteria pose a major threat to human health in an era fraught with multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. Despite extensive drug discovery campaigns over the past decades, no new antibiotic target class effective against gram-negative bacteria has become available to patients since the advent of the carbapenems in 1985. Antibiotic discovery efforts against gram-negative bacteria have been hampered by limited intracellular accumulation of xenobiotics, in large part due to the impermeable cell envelope comprising lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane, as well as a panoply of efflux pumps. The biosynthesis and transport of LPS are essential to the viability and virulence of most gram-negative bacteria. Thus, both LPS biosynthesis and transport are attractive pathways to target therapeutically. In this review, we summarize the LPS biosynthesis and transport pathways and discuss efforts to find small molecule inhibitors against targets within these pathways.

Abstract: Recently, we reported the TRPV4 ion channel activation and its association with secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI). TRPV4 activation is linked with blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption, endothelial damage, and inflammation after SCI. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) are endogenous lipid mediators released for inflammation resolution. Studies suggest that SPM could act as an endogenous antagonist of ion channels directly or indirectly at the plasma membrane. Herein, we studied the effect of maresin-1, a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived SPM, in SCI-induced TRPV4 expression and subsequent associated damage. First, employing a particular agonist (4αPDD) in endothelial and neuronal cell lines, we examined the potential of maresin-1 to block TRPV4 activation. Then we quantify the DHA levels in plasma and epicenter of the spinal cord in sham and at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28-days post-injury (DPI) using LC-MS. Then, we exogenously administered maresin-1 using two dosing regimens i.e., single-dose (1 μg) and multiple-dose (1 μg/day for seven days), to confirm its role in the TRPV4 inhibition and its linked damage. After SCI, DHA levels decrease in the spinal cord epicenter area as well as in the plasma. Treatment with maresin-1 attenuates TRPV4 expression, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines and impedes neutrophil infiltration. Furthermore, treatment with maresin-1 prevents BSCB disruption, alleviates glial scar formation, and improves functional recovery. Thus, our results suggest that maresin-1 could modulate TRPV4 expression and could be a safe and promising approach to target inflammation and BSCB damage after SCI.

Abstract: Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, the main pathogenic peptide in Alzheimer's disease, has been shown to induce an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration (CCC). In the current study, we explored the cytotoxic signal transduction pathway in 42-amino-acid Aβ (Aβ42)-treated HeLa cells in relation to the increase in CCC. The increase in CCC was prominent in cells treated twice with oligomeric Aβ42. We previously showed that double treatment also promoted Aβ-induced lamin fragmentation (AILF), which appears to be mediated by cathepsin L. Apoptotic caspase activation was a downstream event of AILF. The Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM suppressed cell death, cathepsin L activation, AILF, and caspase activation in Aβ-treated cells. These results indicate that Aβ42 induces an increase in CCC, which is an event upstream of the cytotoxic processes. The products of AILF are different from those produced by other cell death-inducing agents, such as staurosporine, which induces caspase-6-mediated lamin fragmentation (CMLF). CMLF was unaffected by BAPTA-AM and was not detected in cells treated with Aβ42, indicating that Aβ42 peptide induced a specific cytotoxic pathway involving AILF via increased CCC. We confirmed that the same processes (except caspase activation) operated in Aβ42-treated neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.

Abstract: Conventionally, myo-D-inositol 1, 4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is thought to exert its second messenger effects through the gating of IP3R Ca2+ release channels, located in Ca2+-storage organelles like the endoplasmic reticulum. However, there is considerable indirect evidence to support the concept that IP3 might interact with other, non-IP3R proteins within cells. To explore this possibility further, the Protein Data Bank was searched using the term “IP3”. This resulted in the retrieval of 203 protein structures, the majority of which were members of the IP3R/ryanodine receptor superfamily of channels. Only 49 of these structures were complexed with IP3. These were inspected for their ability to interact with the carbon-1 phosphate of IP3, since this is the least accessible phosphate group of its precursor, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). This reduced the number of structures retrieved to 35, of which 9 were IP3Rs. The remaining 26 structures represent a diverse range of proteins, including inositol-lipid metabolizing enzymes, signal transducers, PH domain containing proteins, cytoskeletal anchor proteins, the TRPV4 ion channel, a retroviral Gag protein and fibroblast growth factor 2. Such proteins may impact on IP3 signalling and its effects on cell-biology. This represents an area open for exploration in the field of IP3 signalling.

Abstract: Tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) are ectopic aggregates of immune cells. As accumulating studies demonstrate TLOs as a predictor of better prognosis in certain cancers, targeting TLO formation, which is tightly regulated by the lymphoid tissue organizer cells (LTOs), has become intriguing in cancer treatment. However, the clinical outcome of these attempts is limited, because the approaches for activating tumor adjacent LTO is lack and little is known about what type of self-cell can be used as LTO to initiate TLO formation. Here we demonstrate that co-stimulation with membrane-bound ligand LTα1β2 and soluble TNF-α could induced an LTO-like activity in murine neonatal dermal fibroblast, featured by high expression of cell migration-associated chemokines and adhesion molecules that resemble typical LTO gene signature. Furthermore, the LTO-phenotypic dermal fibroblast could enhance the attachment and survival of T and B cell and proliferation of T cell. These findings suggest dermal fibroblast as a promising target for TLO induction to improve cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: In the central nervous system, thrombin-mediated activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs) results in neuroinflammation and increased vascular permeability. These events have been linked to cancer and neurodegeneration. Endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from sporadic cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) specimens showed dysregulation of genes involved in “thrombin-mediated PAR-1 activation” signaling. CCM is a vascular disease involving brain capillaries. In CCM, ECs show defective cell junctions. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation play a key role in disease onset and progression. In order to confirm the possible role of thrombin pathway in sporadic CCM pathogenesis, we evaluated PARs expression in CCM-ECs. We found that sporadic CCM-ECs overexpress PAR1, PAR3 and PAR4, together with other coagulation factor encoding genes. Moreover, we investigated about expression of the three familial CCM genes (KRIT1, CCM2 and PDCD10) in human cerebral microvascular ECs, following thrombin exposure, as well as protein level. Thrombin exposure affects EC viability and results in dysregulation of CCM gene expression and, then, in decreased protein level. Our results confirm amplification of PAR pathway in CCM suggesting, for the first time, the possible role of PAR1-mediated thrombin signaling in sporadic CCM. Thrombin-mediated PARs over activation results in increased blood-brain barrier permeability due to loss of cell junction integrity and, in this context, also the three familial CCM genes may be involved.

Abstract: Hypoxia plays an important role in pancreatic cancer progression. It drives various metabolic reprogramming in cells including that of lipids, which in turn, can modify the structure and function of cell membranes. Homeostatic adaptation of membranes is well-recognized, but how and if it is regulated in hypoxic pancreatic cancer and its relation to aggressive phenotype and metastasis remains elusive. Here we show hypoxia-induced extensive global lipid remodelling spanning changes in lipid classes, unsaturation levels, glyceryl backbone and acyl chain lengths. No major modulation of plasma membrane biophysical properties revealed a decoupling of lipidome modulation from membrane properties under hypoxia. This was supported by observing minor changes in the lipidome of plasma membranes under hypoxia. Further, hypoxia increased migration and invasion underpinned by reduced actin volume, cell cortical stiffness and facile tether dynamics. In conclusion, we demonstrate buffering of the lipidome alterations leading to a homeostatic membrane response. These findings will help to understand the hypoxic regulation of pancreatic membrane homeostasis and identify tangible theranostic avenues.

Abstract: Reactivating p53 and Inducing Tumor Apoptosis (RITA) has been reported to increase the p53 activity and to trigger p53-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells with wild-type p53. Tumor suppressor p53 interacts with nucleolar phosphoproteins nucleophosmin (NPM) and nucleolin (NCL), which have crucial role in many cellular processes. Specific NPM mutations associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cause aberrant localization of NPM and p53 in the cytoplasm with possible impact on the p53 function. We tested an effect of RITA on primary cells, and we found significant RITA-induced changes in NPM and NCL phosphorylation associated with apoptosis in cells of AML patients, but not that of healthy donors. Subsequent screening of several AML cell lines revealed heterogeneous response to RITA, and confirmed an association of the specific phosphorylation with apoptosis. While decreased NCL phosphorylation at Threonines T76 and T84 could be attributed to RITA-induced cell cycle arrest, enhanced NPM phosphorylation at Threonine T199 was not accompanied by the cell cycle changes and it correlated with sensitivity to RITA. Simultaneously, inverse changes occurred at Serine S4 of the NPM. These new findings of RITA mechanism of action could establish the NPM pT199/pS4 ratio as a marker for suitability of RITA treatment of AML cells.

Abstract: Purpose
Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of lens epithelial cells (LECs) contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related cataract (ARC). The purpose of this research is to underlie the potential mechanism of E3 ligase Parkin and its oxidative stress-associated substrate in cataractogenesis.
Methods
The central anterior capsules were obtained from patients with ARC, Emory mice, and corresponding controls. SRA01/04 cells were exposed to H2O2 combined with cycloheximide (a translational inhibitor), MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor), chloroquine (an autophagy inhibitor), Mdivi-1 (a mitochondrial division inhibitor), respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation was employed to detect protein-protein interactions and ubiquitin-tagged protein products. Levels of proteins and mRNA were evaluated by western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR assays.
Results
Glutathione-S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) was identified as a novel Parkin substrate. Compared with corresponding controls, GSTP1 was significantly decreased in the anterior lens capsules obtained from human cataracts and Emory mice. Similarly, GSTP1 was declined in H2O2-stimulated SRA01/04 cells. Ectopic expression of GSTP1 mitigated H2O2-induced apoptosis, whereas silencing GSTP1 aggregated apoptosis. In addition, H2O2 stimulation and Parkin overexpression could promote the degradation of GSTP1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy-lysosome pathway, and mitophagy. After co-transfection with Parkin, the non-ubiquitinatable GSTP1 mutant maintained its anti-apoptotic function, while wildtype GSTP1 failed. Mechanistically, GSTP1 might promote mitochondrial fusion through upregulating Mitofusins 1/2 (MFN1/2).

Abstract: The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has considerable pro-inflammatory properties and is a driver of many physiological and pathophysiological processes. Cellular responses to IL-6 are mediated by membrane-bound or soluble forms of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) complexed with the signal-transducing subunit gp130. While expression of the membrane-bound IL-6R is restricted to selected cell types, soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) enables gp130 engagement on all cells, a process termed IL-6 trans-signalling and considered to be pro-inflammatory. sIL-6R is predominantly generated through proteolytic processing by the metalloproteinase ADAM17. ADAM17 also liberates ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a prerequisite for EGFR activation and results in stimulation of proliferative signals. Hyperactivation of EGFR mostly due to activating mutations drives cancer development. Here, we reveal an important link between overshooting EGFR signalling and the IL-6 trans-signalling pathway. In epithelial cells, EGFR activity induces not only IL-6 expression but also the proteolytic release of sIL-6R from the cell membrane by increasing ADAM17 surface activity. We find that this derives from the transcriptional upregulation of iRhom2, a crucial regulator of ADAM17 trafficking and activation, upon EGFR engagement, which results in increased surface localization of ADAM17. Also, phosphorylation of the EGFR-downstream mediator ERK mediates ADAM17 activity via interaction with iRhom2. In sum, our study reveals an unforeseen interplay between EGFR activation and IL-6 trans-signalling, which has been shown to be fundamental in inflammation and cancer.

Abstract: Objective
This study aims to explore the potential biomarkers in the development of diabetes mellitus (DM) into diabetic retinopathy (DR).
Methods
Systematic review of diabetic metabolomics was used to screen the differential metabolites and related pathways during the development of DM. Non-targeted lipidomics of rat plasma was performed to explore the differential metabolites in the development of DM into DR in vivo. To verify the effects of differential metabolites in inducing retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs) injury by increasing oxidative stress, high glucose medium containing differential metabolites was used to induce rat RMECs injury and cell viability, malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were evaluated in vitro. Network pharmacology was performed to explore the potential mechanism of differential metabolites in inducing DR.
Results
Through the systematic review, 148 differential metabolites were obtained and the sphingolipid metabolic pathway attracted our attention. Plasma non-targeted lipidomics found that sphingolipids were accompanied by the development of DM into DR. In vitro experiments showed sphinganine and sphingosine-1-phosphate aggravated rat RMECs injury induced by high glucose, further increased MDA and ROS levels, and further decreased SOD activities and MMP. Network pharmacology revealed sphinganine and sphingosine-1-phosphate may induce DR by regulating the AGE-RAGE and HIF-1 signaling pathways.
Conclusions
Integrated systematic review, lipidomics and experiment verification reveal that abnormal sphingolipid metabolism facilitates DR by inducing oxidative stress on RMECs. Our study could provide the experimental basis for finding potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of DR.

Abstract: Mitosis is a complicated and ordered process with high energy demands and metabolite fluxes. Cytosolic creatine kinase (CK), an enzyme involved in ATP homeostasis, has been shown to be essential to chromosome movement during mitotic anaphase in sea urchin. However, it remains elusive for the molecular mechanism underlying the recruitment of cytosolic CK by the mitotic apparatus. In this study, Fam96b/MIP18, a component of the MMXD complex with a function in Fe/S cluster supply, was identified as a brain-type CK (CKB)-binding protein. The binding of Fam96b with CKB was independent of the presence of CKB substrates and did not interfere with CKB activity. Fam96b was prone to oligomerize via the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds, while the binding of enzymatically active CKB could modulate Fam96b oligomerization. Oligomerized Fam96b recruited CKB and the MMXD complex to associate with the mitotic spindle. Depletion of Fam96b or CKB by siRNA in the HeLa cells led to mitotic defects, which further resulted in retarded cell proliferation, increased cell death and aberrant cell cycle progression. Rescue experiments indicated that both Fam96b oligomerization and CKB activity were essential to the proper formation of mitotic spindle. These findings suggest that Fam96b may act as a scaffold protein to coordinate the supply and homeostasis of ATP and Fe/S clusters during mitosis.

Abstract: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the main carrier of cholesterol transport in plasma, which participates in regulating lipid homeostasis. Studies in mammals have shown that high levels of LDL in plasma absorbed by macrophages trigger the formation of lipid-rich foam cells, leading to the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Although lipid-rich atherosclerosis-like lesions have been discovered in the aorta of several fish species, the physiological function of LDL in fish macrophages remains poorly understood. In the present study, LDL was isolated from the plasma of large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), and mass spectrometry analysis identified two truncated forms of apolipoprotein B100 in the LDL protein profile. Transcriptomic analysis of LDL-stimulated macrophages revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in various pathways related to lipid metabolism, as confirmed by the fact that LDL increased total cholesterol and cholesteryl esters content. Meanwhile, the gene and protein expression levels of perilipin2 (PLIN2), a DEG enriched in the PPAR signaling pathway, were upregulated in response to LDL stimulation. Importantly, knocking down plin2 significantly attenuates LDL-induced cholesterol accumulation and promotes cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, the transcription factor PPARγ, which is upregulated in response to LDL stimulation, can enhance the promoter activity of plin2. In conclusion, this study suggests that LDL may upregulate plin2 expression through PPARγ, resulting in cholesterol accumulation in fish macrophages. This study will facilitate the investigation of the function of LDL in regulating lipid homeostasis in macrophages and shed light on the evolutionary origin of LDL metabolism in vertebrates.

Abstract: Hypertrophy of adipocytes represents the main cause of obesity. We investigated in vitro the changes associated with adipocyte differentiation and hypertrophy focusing on the nuclear morphometry and chromatin epigenetic remodelling. The 3 T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were firstly differentiated into mature adipocytes, then cultured with long-chain fatty acids to induce hypertrophy. Confocal and super-resolution stimulation emission depletion (STED) microscopy combined with ELISA assays allowed us to explore nuclear architecture, chromatin distribution and epigenetic modifications. In each condition, we quantified the triglyceride accumulation, the mRNA expression of adipogenesis and dysfunction markers, the release of five pro-inflammatory cytokines. Confocal microscopy revealed larger volume and less elongated shape of the nuclei in both mature and hypertrophic cells respect to pre-adipocytes, and a trend toward reduced chromatin compaction. Compared to mature adipocytes, the hypertrophic phenotype showed larger triglyceride content, increased PPARγ expression reduced IL-1a release, and up-regulation of a pool of genes markers for adipose tissue dysfunction. Moreover, a remodelling of both epigenome and chromatin organization was observed in hypertrophic adipocytes, with an increase in the average fluorescence of H3K9 acetylated domains in parallel with the increase in KAT2A expression, and a global hypomethylation of DNA. These findings making light on the nuclear changes during adipocyte differentiation and hypertrophy might help the strategies for treating obesity and metabolic complications.

Abstract: Endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane contact sites (ER-PM MCS) are a specialised domain involved in the control of Ca2+ dynamics and various Ca2+-dependent cellular processes. Intracellular Ca2+ signals are broadly supported by Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ channels such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and subsequent store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) across the PM to replenish store content. IP3Rs sit in close proximity to the PM where they can easily access newly synthesised IP3, interact with binding partners such as actin, and localise adjacent to ER-PM MCS populated by the SOCE machinery, STIM1–2 and Orai1–3, to possibly form a locally regulated unit of Ca2+ influx. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is a multiplex regulator of Ca2+ signalling at the ER-PM MCS interacting with multiple proteins at these junctions such as actin and STIM1, whilst also being consumed as a substrate for phospholipase C to produce IP3 in response to extracellular stimuli. In this review, we consider the mechanisms regulating the synthesis and turnover of PtdIns(4,5)P2 via the phosphoinositide cycle and its significance for sustained signalling at the ER-PM MCS. Furthermore, we highlight recent insights into the role of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the spatiotemporal organization of signalling at ER-PM junctions and raise outstanding questions on how this multi-faceted regulation occurs.

Abstract: Recent researches have uncovered that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely correlated with the development of different diseases, while biological functions and hidden molecular mechanisms of antisense lncRNAs in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain unclear. Here, we identified upregulation of LINC01116 in RNA sequencing data, online database, and in OSCC and intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN) specimens. Functionally, LINC01116 facilitates OSCC advancement and metastasis in vitro and vivo. Mechanistically, elevated expression of LINC01116 in OSCC cells other than tumor stroma and cytoplasmic enables it to activate AGO1 expression via complementary binding with AGO1 mRNA to facilitate EMT process of OSCC.

Abstract: Bacterial-extracellular-vesicles (BEVs) derived from Escherichia coli, strain-A5922, were used as a therapeutic tool to treat colon cancer cells, HT-29. BEVs induced oxidative stress, and observed mitochondrial autophagy, known as mitophagy, were crucial in initiation of treatment. The mitophagy, induced by the BEVs in HT-29 cells, produced adenocarcinomic cytotoxicity, and stopped the cells growth. The trigger for mitophagy, and an increase in productions of reactive oxygen species led to cellular oxidative stress, that eventually led to cells death. A reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential, and an increase in the PINK1 expressions confirmed the oxidative stress involvements. The BEVs triggered cytotoxicity, and mitophagy in the HT-29 carcinoid cells, channelized through the Akt/mTOR pathways connecting the cellular oxidative stress, effectively played its part to cause cells death. These findings substantiated the BEVs' potential as a plausible tool for treating, and possibly preventing the colorectal cancer.

Abstract: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly metastatic and recalcitrant malignancy. Metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with SCLC but its mechanism remains poorly understood. An imbalance of hyaluronan catabolism in the extracellular matrix accelerates malignant progression in solid cancers due to the accumulation of low-molecular-weight HA. We previously found that CEMIP, a novel hyaluronidase, may act as a metastatic trigger in SCLC. In the present study, we found that both CEMIP and HA levels were higher in SCLC tissues than in paracancerous tissues from patient specimens and in vivo orthotopic models. Additionally, high expression of CEMIP was associated with lymphatic metastasis in patients with SCLC, and in vitro results showed that CEMIP expression was elevated in SCLC cells relative to human bronchial epithelial cells. Mechanistically, CEMIP facilitates the breakdown of HA and accumulation of LMW-HA. LMW-HA activates its receptor TLR2, and subsequently recruits c-Src to activate ERK1/2 signalling, thereby promoting F-actin rearrangement as well as migration and invasion of SCLC cells. In addition, the in vivo results verified that depletion of CEMIP attenuated HA levels and the expressions of TLR2, c-Src, and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, as well as liver and brain metastasis in SCLC xenografts. Furthermore, the application of the actin filament inhibitor latrunculin A significantly inhibited the liver and brain metastasis of SCLC in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal the critical role of CEMIP-mediated HA degradation in SCLC metastasis and suggest its translational potential as an attractive target and a novel strategy for SCLC therapy.

Abstract: The DNA double-strand breaks are particularly deleterious, especially when an error-free repair pathway is unavailable, enforcing the error-prone recombination pathways to repair the lesion. Cells can resume the cell cycle but at the expense of decreased viability due to genome rearrangements. One of the major players involved in recombinational repair of DNA damage is Rad51 recombinase, a protein responsible for presynaptic complex formation. We previously showed that an increased level of this protein promotes the usage of illegitimate recombination. Here we show that the level of Rad51 is regulated via the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. The ubiquitination of Rad51 depends on multiple E3 enzymes, including SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases. We also demonstrate that Rad51 can be modified by both ubiquitin and SUMO. Moreover, its modification with ubiquitin may lead to opposite effects: degradation dependent on Rad6, Rad18, Slx8, Dia2, and the anaphase-promoting complex, or stabilization dependent on Rsp5. We also show that post-translational modifications with SUMO and ubiquitin affect Rad51's ability to form and disassemble DNA repair foci, respectively, influencing cell cycle progression and cell viability in genotoxic stress conditions. Our data suggest the existence of a complex E3 ligases network that regulates Rad51 recombinase's turnover, its molecular activity, and access to DNA, limiting it to the proportions optimal for the actual cell cycle stage and growth conditions, e.g., stress. Dysregulation of this network would result in a drop in cell viability due to uncontrolled genome rearrangement in the yeast cells. In mammals would promote the development of genetic diseases and cancer.

Abstract: Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), a mitochondrial deacetylase, regulates mitochondrial redox homeostasis and autophagy and is involved in physiological and pathological processes such as aging, cellular metabolism, and tumorigenesis. We here investigate how Sirt3 regulates doxorubicin (DOX)-induced senescence in lung cancer A549 cells. Sirt3 greatly reduced DOX-induced upregulation of senescence marker proteins p53, p16, p21 and SA-β-Gal activity as well as ROS levels. Notably, Sirt3 reversed DOX-induced autophagic flux blockage, as shown by increased p62 degradation and LC3II/LC3I ratio. Importantly, the autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine (CQ) partially abolished the antioxidant stress and antiaging effects of Sirt3, while the autophagy activator rapamycin (Rap) potentiated these effects of Sirt3, demonstrating that autophagy mediates the anti-aging effects of Sirt3. Additionally, Sirt3 inhibited the DOX-induced activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which in turn activated autophagy. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 promoted the antioxidant stress and antiaging effects of Sirt3, while the AKT activator SC-79 reversed these effects of Sirt3. Taken together, Sirt3 counteracts DOX-induced senescence by improving autophagic flux.

Abstract: N-glycosylation has been revealed to be tightly associated with cancer metastasis. As a key transferase that catalyzes the formation of β1,4 N-acetylglucosamine (β1,4GlcNAc) branches on the mannose core of N-glycans, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IVa (GnT-IVa) has been reported to be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis by forming N-glycans; however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In the current study, we found that GnT-IVa was upregulated in HCC tissues and positively correlated with worse outcomes in HCC patients. We found that GnT-IVa could promote tumor growth in mice; notably, this effect was attenuated after mutating the enzymatic site (D445A) of GnT-IVa, suggesting that GnT-IVa regulated HCC progression by forming β1,4GlcNAc branches. To mechanistically investigate the role of GnT-IVa in HCC, we conducted GSEA and GO functional analysis as well as in vitro experiments. The results showed that GnT-IVa could enhance HCC cell migration, invasion and adhesion ability and increase β1,4GlcNAc branch glycans on integrin β1 (ITGB1), a tumor-associated glycoprotein that is closely involved in cell motility by interacting with vimentin. Interruption of β1,4GlcNAc branch glycan modification on ITGB1 could suppress the interaction of ITGB1 with vimentin and inhibit cell motility. These results revealed that GnT-IVa could promote HCC cell motility by affecting the biological functions of ITGB1 through N-glycosylation. In summary, our results revealed that GnT-IVa is highly expressed in HCC and can form β1,4GlcNAc branches on ITGB1, which are essential for interactions with vimentin to promote HCC cell motility. These findings not only proposed a novel mechanism for GnT-IVa in HCC progression but also revealed the significance of N-glycosylation on ITGB1 during the process, which may provide a novel target for future HCC therapy.

Abstract: Aurantiochytrium sp., a marine thraustochytrid possesses a remarkable ability to produce lipid rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Although gene regulation underlying lipid biosynthesis has been previously reported, proteomic analysis is still limited. In this study, high DHA accumulating strain Aurantiochytrium sp. SW1 has been used as a study model to elucidate the alteration in proteome profile under different cultivation phases i.e. growth, nitrogen-limitation and lipid accumulation. Of the total of 5146 identified proteins, 852 proteins were differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). The largest number of DEPs (488 proteins) was found to be uniquely expressed between lipid accumulating phase and growth phase. Interestingly, there were up-regulated proteins involved in glycolysis, glycerolipid, carotenoid and glutathione metabolism which were preferable metabolic routes towards lipid accumulation and DHA production as well as cellular oxidative defence. Integrated proteomic and transcriptomic data were also conducted to comprehend the gene and protein regulation underlying the lipid and DHA biosynthesis. A significant up-regulation of acetyl-CoA synthetase was observed which suggests alternative route of acetate metabolism for acetyl-CoA producer. This study presents the holistic routes underlying lipid accumulation and DHA production in Aurantiochytrium sp. SW1 and other relevant thraustochytrid.

Abstract: Lead is a highly toxic metal that severely perturbs physiological processes even at sub-micromolar levels, often by disrupting the Ca2+ signaling pathways. Recently, Pb2+-associated cardiac toxicity has emerged, with potential involvement of both the ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor protein calmodulin (CaM) and ryanodine receptors. In this work, we explored the hypothesis that Pb2+ contributes to the pathological phenotype of CaM variants associated with congenital arrhythmias. We performed a thorough spectroscopic and computational characterization of CaM conformational switches in the co-presence of Pb2+ and four missense mutations associated with congenital arrhythmias, namely N53I, N97S, E104A and F141L, and analyzed their effects on the recognition of a target peptide of RyR2. When bound to any of the CaM variants, Pb2+ is difficult to displace even under equimolar Ca2+ concentrations, thus locking all CaM variants in a specific conformation, which exhibits characteristics of coiled-coil assemblies. All arrhythmia-associated variants appear to be more susceptible to Pb2+ than wild type (WT) CaM, as the conformational transition towards the coiled-coil conformation occurs at lower Pb2+, regardless of the presence of Ca2+, with altered cooperativity. The presence of arrhythmia-associated mutations specifically alters the cation coordination of CaM variants, in some cases involving allosteric communication between the EF-hands in the two domains. Finally, while WT CaM increases the affinity for the RyR2 target in the presence of Pb2+, no specific pattern could be detected for all other variants, ruling out a synergistic effect of Pb2+ and mutations in the recognition process.

Abstract: Our previous studies have implicated an important role of adipokine chemerin in exercise-induced improvements of glycolipid metabolism and fatty liver in diabetes rat, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This study first used an exogenous chemerin supplement to clarify the roles of decreased chemerin in exercised diabetes mice and possible mechanisms of glucose and lipid metabolism key enzymes and proteins [such as adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)]. In addition, two kinds of adipose-specific chemerin knockout mice were generated to demonstrate the regulation of chemerin on glucose and lipid metabolism enzymes and proteins. We found that in diabetes mice, exercise-induced improvements of glucose and lipid metabolism and fatty liver, and exercise-induced increases of ATGL, LPL, and GLUT4 in liver, gastrocnemius and fat were reversed by exogenous chemerin. Furthermore, in chemerin knockdown mice, chemerin(−/−)∙adiponectin mice had lower body fat mass, improved blood glucose and lipid, and no fatty liver; while chemerin(−/−)∙fabp4 mice had hyperlipemia and unchanged body fat mass. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), ATGL, LPL, GLUT4 and PEPCK in the liver and gastrocnemius had improve changes in chemerin(−/−)·adiponectin mice while deteriorated alterations in chemerin(−/−)·fabp4 mice, although PPARγ, ATGL, LPL, and GLUT4 increased in the fat of two kinds of chemerin(−/−) mice.
Conclusions
Decreased chemerin exerts an important role in exercise-induced improvements of glucose and lipid metabolism and fatty liver in diabetes mice, which was likely to be through PPARγ mediating elevations of ATGL, LPL and GLUT4 in peripheral metabolic organs.

Abstract: The effects of different concentrations of Hofmeister salts on the hydrolytic activity on triglycerides and the secondary structure of lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) were investigated. Structural changes after short- and long-time incubation at high salt concentrations were determined using circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence, and RMSD-RMSF simulations. At 5.2 M NaCl, the hydrolytic activity of CALB on tributyrin (TC4) and trioctanoin (TC8) was enhanced by 1.5 (from 817 ± 3.9 to 1228 ± 4.3 U/mg)- and 8.7 (from 25 ± 0.3 to 218 ± 2.3 U/mg)-folds compared with 0.15 M NaCl, respectively at pH 7.0 and 40 °C. An activity activation was seen with other salts tested; however, long-time incubation (24 h) did not result in retention of the activation effect for any of the salts tested. Secondary structure CD and fluorescence spectra showed that long-time incubation with NaCl, KCl, and CsCl provokes a compact structure without loss of native conformation, whereas chaotropic LiCl and CaCl2 induced an increase in the α-helical content, and kosmotropic Na2SO4 provoked a molten globule state with rich β-sheet content. The RMSD-RMSF simulation agreed with the CD analysis, highlighting a principal salt-induced effect at the α-helix 5 region, promoting two different conformational states (open and closed) depending on the type and concentration of salt. Lastly, an increase in the interfacial tension occurred when high salt concentrations were added to the reaction media, affecting the catalytic properties. The results indicate that high-salt environments, such as 2–5.2 M NaCl, can be used to increase the lipolytic activity of CALB on TC4 and TC8.

Abstract: Adipocyte browning increases energy expenditure by thermogenesis, which has been considered a potential strategy against obesity and its related metabolic diseases. Phytochemicals derived from natural products with the ability to improve adipocyte thermogenesis have aroused extensive attention. Acteoside (Act), a phenylethanoid glycoside, exists in various medicinal or edible plants and has been shown to regulate metabolic disorders. Here, the browning effect of Act was evaluated by stimulating beige cell differentiation from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in the inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and by converting the iWAT-SVF derived mature white adipocytes. Act improves adipocyte browning by differentiation of the stem/progenitors into beige cells and by direct conversion of mature white adipocytes into beige cells. Mechanistically, Act inhibited CDK6 and mTOR, and consequently relieved phosphorylation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB) and increased its nuclear retention, leading to induction of PGC-1α, a driver of mitochondrial biogenesis, and UCP1-dependent browning. These data thus unveil a CDK6-mTORC1-TFEB pathway that regulates Act-induced adipocyte browning.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is the main cause of cardiovascular disease, and fluid shear stress is a key factor regulating its occurrence and development. Oscillatory shear stress (Oss) is an important pro-atherosclerosis factor. Oss mainly occurs in areas that are susceptible to atherosclerosis, but the exact mechanism of atherosclerosis induction remains unclear. Therefore, starting from the atheroprone phenotype that Oss stimulates abnormal vascular endothelial cell proliferation, this study aimed to reveal the underlying mechanism of Oss-induced atherosclerosis formation and to identify new targets for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. In this study, the gene encoding thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), which is closely related to atherosclerosis development and cell proliferation, was screened by analyzing the transcriptome sequencing data of static and Oss-treated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Moreover, this study successfully verified that TXNRD1 mRNA and protein were significantly upregulated in Oss-treated HAECs. Oss significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of HAECs, whereas TXNRD1 knockdown impaired the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of Oss-treated HAECs, and this process was mainly achieved via activation of the apoptosis pathway. To further clarify whether Oss-sensitive TXNRD1 affects the apoptosis rate and proliferative ability of HAECs by regulating the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway, we used NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) to inhibit eNOS activity and nitric oxide (NO) production. L-NAME significantly reversed the promoting effect of TXNRD1 knockdown on Oss-treated HAEC apoptosis, and it also abolished the inhibitory effect of TXNRD1 knockdown on the proliferation and S + G2 phase cell mass of Oss-treated HAECs. In conclusion, this study showed that TXNRD1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of HAECs exposed to Oss by activating the eNOS/apoptosis pathway, revealing that TXNRD1 is involved in the dysregulation of Oss-induced endothelial cell proliferation. These findings provide new directions and insights into the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Chlorogenic acid (CGA) as one of the most ubiquitously dietary polyphenolic compounds, has been reported to have various antimicrobial effects and exhibit strong anti-inflammatory ability. Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that can induce mastitis. However, the mechanism through which S. aureus infection affects lipid synthesis and whether CGA have protective effect on S. aureus reduced lipid synthesis is not fully understood. In this study, the internalization of S. aureus reduced intracellular lipid droplet formation, decreased the levels of intracellular triacylglycerol, total cholesterol and 7 types of fatty acid and downregulated the expression of lipogenic genes FAS, ACC, and DGAT1 in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). In addition, we found that S. aureus intracellular infection attenuated mTORC1 activation resulting in Lipin 1 nuclear localization. Remarkablely, S. aureus infection-mediated repression of lipid synthesis related to the mTORC1 signaling and Lipin 1 nuclear localization can be alleviated by CGA. Thus, our findings provide a novel mechanism by which lipid synthesis is regulated under S. aureus infection and the protective effects of CGA on lipid synthesis in BMECs.

Abstract: Inflammation is the hallmark of most joint disorders. However, the precise regulation of induction, perpetuation, and resolution of joint inflammation is not entirely understood. Since extracellular vesicles (EVs) are critical for intercellular communication, we aim to unveil their role in these processes. Here, we investigated the EVs' dynamics and phospholipidome profile from synovial fluid (SF) of healthy equine joints and from horses with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced synovitis. LPS injection triggered a sharp increase of SF-EVs at 5-8 h post-injection, which started to decline at 24 h post-injection. Importantly, we identified significant changes in the lipid profile of SF-EVs after synovitis induction. Compared to healthy joint-derived SF-EVs (0 h), SF-EVs collected at 5, 24, and 48 h post-LPS injection were strongly increased in hexosylceramides. At the same time, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin were decreased in SF-EVs at 5 h and 24 h post-LPS injection. Based on the lipid changes during acute inflammation, we composed specific lipid profiles associated with healthy and inflammatory state-derived SF-EVs. The sharp increase in SF-EVs during acute synovitis and the correlation of specific lipids with either healthy or inflamed states-derived SF-EVs are findings of potential interest for unveiling the role of SF-EVs in joint inflammation, as well as for the identification of EV-biomarkers of joint inflammation.

Abstract: During lactation, mammary epithelial cells (MECs) on the apical membrane are in contact with lactose in milk, while MECs on the basolateral membrane are in contact with glucose in blood. Both glucose and lactose are sweeteners that are sensed by a sweet taste receptor. Previously, we have shown that lactose exposure on the basolateral membrane, but not the apical membrane, inhibits casein production and phosphorylation of STAT5 in MECs. However, it remains unclear whether MECs have a sweet taste receptor. In this study, we confirmed that the sweet taste receptor subunit T1R3 existed in both the apical and basolateral membranes of MECs. Subsequently, we investigated the influence of apical and basolateral sucralose as a ligand for the sweet taste receptor using a cell culture model. In this model, upper and lower media were separated by the MEC layer with less-permeable tight junctions. The results showed in the absence of glucose, both apical and basolateral sucralose induced phosphorylation of STAT5, which is a positive transcriptional factor for milk production. In contrast, the T1R3 inhibitor basolateral lactisole reducing phosphorylated STAT5 and secreted caseins in the presence of glucose. Furthermore, exposure of the apical membrane to sucralose in the presence of glucose inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT5. Simultaneously, GLUT1 was partially translocated from the basolateral membrane to the cytoplasm in MECs. These results suggest that T1R3 functions as a sweet receptor and is closely involved in casein production in MECs.

Abstract: Endosomal trafficking is intricately linked to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) fate and signaling. Extracellular uridine diphosphate (UDP) acts as a signaling molecule by selectively activating the GPCR P2Y6. Despite the recent interest for this receptor in pathologies, such as gastrointestinal and neurological diseases, there is sparse information on the endosomal trafficking of P2Y6 receptors in response to its endogenous agonist UDP and synthetic selective agonist 5-iodo-UDP (MRS2693). Confocal microscopy and cell surface ELISA revealed delayed internalization kinetics in response to MRS2693 vs. UDP stimulation in AD293 and HCT116 cells expressing human P2Y6. Interestingly, UDP induced clathrin-dependent P2Y6 internalization, whereas receptor stimulation by MRS2693 endocytosis appeared to be associated with a caveolin-dependent mechanism. Internalized P2Y6 was associated with Rab4, 5, and 7 positive vesicles independent of the agonist. We have measured a higher frequency of receptor expression co-occurrence with Rab11-vesicles, the trans-Golgi network, and lysosomes in response to MRS2693. Interestingly, a higher agonist concentration reversed the delayed P2Y6 internalization and recycling kinetics in the presence of MRS2693 stimulation without changing its caveolin-dependent internalization. This work showed a ligand-dependent effect affecting the P2Y6 receptor internalization and endosomal trafficking. These findings could guide the development of bias ligands that could influence P2Y6 signaling.

Abstract: The outer membrane is a distinguishing feature of the Gram-negative envelope. It lies on the external face of the peptidoglycan sacculus and forms a robust permeability barrier that protects extracytoplasmic structures from environmental insults. Overcoming the barrier imposed by the outer membrane presents a significant hurdle towards developing novel antibiotics that are effective against Gram-negative bacteria. As the outer membrane is an essential component of the cell, proteins involved in its biogenesis are themselves promising antibiotic targets. Here, we summarize key findings that have built our understanding of the outer membrane. Foundational studies describing the discovery and composition of the outer membrane as well as the pathways involved in its construction are discussed.

Abstract: Vertebrate photoreceptor cells are exquisite light detectors operating under very dim and bright illumination mediated by phototransduction, which is under control of the two secondary messengers cGMP and Ca2+. Feedback mechanisms enable photoreceptor cells to regain their responsiveness after light stimulation and involve neuronal Ca2+-sensor proteins, named GCAPs (guanylate cyclase-activating proteins) and recoverins. This review compares the diversity in Ca2+-related signaling mediated by GCAP and recoverin variants that exhibit differences in Ca2+-sensing, protein conformational changes, myristoyl switch mechanisms, diversity in divalent cation binding and dimer formation. In summary, both subclasses of neuronal Ca2+-sensor proteins contribute to a complex signaling network in rod and cone cells, which is perfectly suited to match the requirements for sensitive cell responses and maintaining this responsiveness in the presence of different background light intensities.
